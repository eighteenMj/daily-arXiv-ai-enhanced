Abstract: Data scarcity and distribution shift pose major challenges for masked face detection and recognition. We propose a two-step generative data augmentation framework that combines rule-based mask warping with unpaired image-to-image translation using GANs, enabling the generation of realistic masked-face samples beyond purely synthetic transformations. Compared to rule-based warping alone, the proposed approach yields consistent qualitative improvements and complements existing GAN-based masked face generation methods such as IAMGAN. We introduce a non-mask preservation loss and stochastic noise injection to stabilize training and enhance sample diversity. Experimental observations highlight the effectiveness of the proposed components and suggest directions for future improvements in data-centric augmentation for face recognition tasks.

TL;DR: JARVIS是一个基于JEPA启发的自监督视觉增强框架，可提升多模态大语言模型的视觉推理能力，而不依赖语言监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MLLMs主要从文本描述中学习视觉理解，这提供了主观且不完备的监督信号，同时指令调优相对于文本预训练的规模较小，导致模型过度依赖语言先验而忽视视觉细节。

Method: 将I-JEPA学习范式整合到标准视觉-语言对齐流程中，使用冻结的视觉基础模型作为上下文和目标编码器，并通过LLM早期层实现的预测器从图像中学习结构语义规则，无需语言监督。

Result: 在标准MLLM基准测试中，JARVIS在不同LLM家族上均能持续提升视觉中心化基准的性能，同时不损害多模态推理能力。

Conclusion: JARVIS框架通过自监督视觉增强有效解决了MLLMs视觉理解不足的问题，为提升多模态模型性能提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in connecting vision and language, yet their proficiency in fundamental visual reasoning tasks remains limited. This limitation can be attributed to the fact that MLLMs learn visual understanding primarily from textual descriptions, which constitute a subjective and inherently incomplete supervisory signal. Furthermore, the modest scale of multimodal instruction tuning compared to massive text-only pre-training leads MLLMs to overfit language priors while overlooking visual details. To address these issues, we introduce JARVIS, a JEPA-inspired framework for self-supervised visual enhancement in MLLMs. Specifically, we integrate the I-JEPA learning paradigm into the standard vision-language alignment pipeline of MLLMs training. Our approach leverages frozen vision foundation models as context and target encoders, while training the predictor, implemented as the early layers of an LLM, to learn structural and semantic regularities from images without relying exclusively on language supervision. Extensive experiments on standard MLLM benchmarks show that JARVIS consistently improves performance on vision-centric benchmarks across different LLM families, without degrading multimodal reasoning abilities. Our source code is publicly available at: https://github.com/aimagelab/JARVIS.

Abstract: Leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to develop embodied agents offers significant promise for addressing complex real-world tasks. However, current evaluation benchmarks remain predominantly language-centric or heavily reliant on simulated environments, rarely probing the nuanced, knowledge-intensive reasoning essential for practical, real-world scenarios. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce the task of Sparsely Grounded Visual Navigation, explicitly designed to evaluate the sequential decision-making abilities of MLLMs in challenging, knowledge-intensive real-world environments. We operationalize this task with CityNav, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing four diverse global cities, specifically constructed to assess raw MLLM-driven agents in city navigation. Agents are required to rely solely on visual inputs and internal multimodal reasoning to sequentially navigate 50+ decision points without additional environmental annotations or specialized architectural modifications. Crucially, agents must autonomously achieve localization through interpreting city-specific cues and recognizing landmarks, perform spatial reasoning, and strategically plan and execute routes to their destinations. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that current state-of-the-art MLLMs and standard reasoning techniques (e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Reflection) significantly underperform in this challenging setting. To address this, we propose Verbalization of Path (VoP), which explicitly grounds the agent's internal reasoning by probing an explicit cognitive map (key landmarks and directions toward the destination) from the MLLMs, substantially enhancing navigation success.

Abstract: Humans perceive and reason about their surroundings in four dimensions by building persistent, structured internal representations that encode semantic meaning, spatial layout, and temporal dynamics. These multimodal memories enable them to recall past events, infer unobserved states, and integrate new information into context-dependent reasoning. Inspired by this capability, we introduce R4, a training-free framework for retrieval-augmented reasoning in 4D spatio-temporal space that equips vision-language models (VLMs) with structured, lifelong memory. R4 continuously constructs a 4D knowledge database by anchoring object-level semantic descriptions in metric space and time, yielding a persistent world model that can be shared across agents. At inference, natural language queries are decomposed into semantic, spatial, and temporal keys to retrieve relevant observations, which are integrated into the VLM's reasoning. Unlike classical retrieval-augmented generation methods, retrieval in R4 operates directly in 4D space, enabling episodic and collaborative reasoning without training. Experiments on embodied question answering and navigation benchmarks demonstrate that R4 substantially improves retrieval and reasoning over spatio-temporal information compared to baselines, advancing a new paradigm for embodied 4D reasoning in dynamic environments.

TL;DR: MLLMs的感知能力评估框架，超越任务精度，关注稳健性、归因保真度和扰动推理


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型虽强大但感知能力未明，且评估方法过于关注终端任务精度，忽视了在面对扰动时的稳健性、归因保真度和推理能力，需要系统化评估其是否真正依赖视觉基础而非文本知识

Method: 提出The Perceptual Observatory框架，通过简单视觉任务（人脸匹配、文本视觉理解）和局部到全局理解（图像匹配、网格指向游戏、属性定位）两个维度，结合带像素增强和基于扩散的样式幻觉的扰动数据集，评估MLLMs的感知能力

Result: 该框架为MLLMs的感知能力提供了系统化评估，揭示了模型在扰动下保持感知基础和关系结构的能力特点，超越了传统排行榜的精确定位

Conclusion: The Perceptual Observatory为当前及未来MLLM模型的优势和不足提供了原则性分析基础，强调了评估感知能力时需超越任务精度，关注模型在受控扰动下的稳健性表现

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have yielded increasingly powerful models, yet their perceptual capacities remain poorly characterized. In practice, most model families scale language component while reusing nearly identical vision encoders (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL 3B/7B/72B), which raises pivotal concerns about whether progress reflects genuine visual grounding or reliance on internet-scale textual world knowledge. Existing evaluation methods emphasize end-task accuracy, overlooking robustness, attribution fidelity, and reasoning under controlled perturbations. We present The Perceptual Observatory, a framework that characterizes MLLMs across verticals like: (i) simple vision tasks, such as face matching and text-in-vision comprehension capabilities; (ii) local-to-global understanding, encompassing image matching, grid pointing game, and attribute localization, which tests general visual grounding. Each vertical is instantiated with ground-truth datasets of faces and words, systematically perturbed through pixel-based augmentations and diffusion-based stylized illusions. The Perceptual Observatory moves beyond leaderboard accuracy to yield insights into how MLLMs preserve perceptual grounding and relational structure under perturbations, providing a principled foundation for analyzing strengths and weaknesses of current and future models.

Abstract: Accurately predicting human behaviors is crucial for mobile robots operating in human-populated environments. While prior research primarily focuses on predicting actions in single-human scenarios from an egocentric view, several robotic applications require understanding multiple human behaviors from a third-person perspective. To this end, we present CAMP-VLM (Context-Aware Multi-human behavior Prediction): a Vision Language Model (VLM)-based framework that incorporates contextual features from visual input and spatial awareness from scene graphs to enhance prediction of humans-scene interactions. Due to the lack of suitable datasets for multi-human behavior prediction from an observer view, we perform fine-tuning of CAMP-VLM with synthetic human behavior data generated by a photorealistic simulator, and evaluate the resulting models on both synthetic and real-world sequences to assess their generalization capabilities. Leveraging Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), CAMP-VLM outperforms the best-performing baseline by up to 66.9% in prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multispectral object detection is critical for safety-sensitive applications such as autonomous driving and surveillance, where robust perception under diverse illumination conditions is essential. However, the limited availability of annotated multispectral data severely restricts the training of deep detectors. In such data-scarce scenarios, textual class information can serve as a valuable source of semantic supervision. Motivated by the recent success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in computer vision, we explore their potential for few-shot multispectral object detection. Specifically, we adapt two representative VLM-based detectors, Grounding DINO and YOLO-World, to handle multispectral inputs and propose an effective mechanism to integrate text, visual and thermal modalities. Through extensive experiments on two popular multispectral image benchmarks, FLIR and M3FD, we demonstrate that VLM-based detectors not only excel in few-shot regimes, significantly outperforming specialized multispectral models trained with comparable data, but also achieve competitive or superior results under fully supervised settings. Our findings reveal that the semantic priors learned by large-scale VLMs effectively transfer to unseen spectral modalities, ofFering a powerful pathway toward data-efficient multispectral perception.

*Earl Ranario,Mason J. Earles*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VLMs在农业分类任务中表现不及专用监督模型，开放式提示效果差且评估方法显著影响结果，目前仍需改进才能独立应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估视觉语言模型在农业决策支持中的可靠性，探究其作为通用视觉识别解决方案的适用性。

Method: 使用27个农业分类数据集对开源和闭源VLMs进行基准测试，比较零样本与监督基准模型(YOLO11)的性能，并分析不同提示方式的影响。

Result: 零样本VLMs在所有任务中都显著低于监督模型；Gemini-3 Pro在多项选择提示下约62%准确率，开放式提示仅25%以下；LLM语义判断能提升开放式提示的性能；任务分析显示植物/杂草分类比病虫害识别更容易。

Conclusion: 当前现成VLMs不适合作为独立的农业诊断系统，但可以作为辅助组件与约束接口、明确标签本体和领域感知评估策略配合使用。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly proposed as general-purpose solutions for visual recognition tasks, yet their reliability for agricultural decision support remains poorly understood. We benchmark a diverse set of open-source and closed-source VLMs on 27 agricultural classification datasets from the AgML collection, spanning 162 classes across plant disease, pest and damage, and plant and weed species identification. Across all tasks, zero-shot VLMs substantially underperform a supervised task-specific baseline (YOLO11), which consistently achieves markedly higher accuracy than any foundation model. Under multiple-choice prompting, the best-performing VLM (Gemini-3 Pro) reaches approximately 62% average accuracy, while open-ended prompting yields much lower performance, with raw accuracies typically below 25%. Applying LLM-based semantic judging increases open-ended accuracy (for example, from 21% to 30% for top models) and alters model rankings, demonstrating that evaluation methodology meaningfully affects reported conclusions. Among open-source models, Qwen-VL-72B performs best, approaching closed-source performance under constrained prompting but still trailing top proprietary systems. Task-level analysis shows that plant and weed species classification is consistently easier than pest and damage identification, which remains the most challenging category across models. Overall, these results indicate that current off-the-shelf VLMs are not yet suitable as standalone agricultural diagnostic systems, but can function as assistive components when paired with constrained interfaces, explicit label ontologies, and domain-aware evaluation strategies.

Abstract: This paper presents a robotic mowing framework that actively enhances garden biodiversity through visual perception and adaptive decision-making. Unlike passive rewilding approaches, the proposed system uses deep feature-space analysis to identify and preserve visually diverse vegetation patches in camera images by selectively deactivating the mower blades. A ResNet50 network pretrained on PlantNet300K provides ecologically meaningful embeddings, from which a global deviation metric estimates biodiversity without species-level supervision. These estimates drive a selective mowing algorithm that dynamically alternates between mowing and conservation behavior. The system was implemented on a modified commercial robotic mower and validated both in a controlled mock-up lawn and on real garden datasets. Results demonstrate a strong correlation between embedding-space dispersion and expert biodiversity assessment, confirming the feasibility of deep visual diversity as a proxy for ecological richness and the effectiveness of the proposed mowing decision approach. Widespread adoption of such systems will turn ecologically worthless, monocultural lawns into vibrant, valuable biotopes that boost urban biodiversity.

Abstract: We present a method to generate video-action pairs that follow text instructions, starting from an initial image observation and the robot's joint states. Our approach automatically provides action labels for video diffusion models, overcoming the common lack of action annotations and enabling their full use for robotic policy learning. Existing methods either adopt two-stage pipelines, which limit tightly coupled cross-modal information sharing, or rely on adapting a single-modal diffusion model for a joint distribution that cannot fully leverage pretrained video knowledge. To overcome these limitations, we (1) extend a pretrained video diffusion model with a parallel, dedicated action diffusion model that preserves pretrained knowledge, (2) introduce a Bridge Attention mechanism to enable effective cross-modal interaction, and (3) design an action refinement module to convert coarse actions into precise controls for low-resolution datasets. Extensive evaluations on multiple public benchmarks and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method generates higher-quality videos, more accurate actions, and significantly outperforms existing baselines, offering a scalable framework for leveraging large-scale video data for robotic learning.

Abstract: Safety-critical corner cases, difficult to collect in the real world, are crucial for evaluating end-to-end autonomous driving. Adversarial interaction is an effective method to generate such safety-critical corner cases. While existing adversarial evaluation methods are built for models operating in simplified simulation environments, adversarial evaluation for real-world end-to-end autonomous driving has been little explored. To address this challenge, we propose a closed-loop evaluation platform for end-to-end autonomous driving, which can generate adversarial interactions in real-world scenes. In our platform, the real-world image generator cooperates with an adversarial traffic policy to evaluate various end-to-end models trained on real-world data. The generator, based on flow matching, efficiently and stably generates real-world images according to the traffic environment information. The efficient adversarial surrounding vehicle policy is designed to model challenging interactions and create corner cases that current autonomous driving systems struggle to handle. Experimental results demonstrate that the platform can generate realistic driving images efficiently. Through evaluating the end-to-end models such as UniAD and VAD, we demonstrate that based on the adversarial policy, our platform evaluates the performance degradation of the tested model in corner cases. This result indicates that this platform can effectively detect the model's potential issues, which will facilitate the safety and robustness of end-to-end autonomous driving.

Motivation: 单壳层低角分辨率dMRI估计FOD精度有限，而多壳层高角分辨率dMRI扫描时间长，应用受限。扩散模型在基于LAR-FOD估计HAR-FOD方面有潜力，但由于FOD中球谐系数数量大，高效生成HAR-FOD具有挑战性。

Method: 提出3D多通道patch扩散模型，设计FOD-patch适配器引入脑解剖先验以提升基于patch的学习效率；引入体素级条件协调模块增强模型全局理解；设计SH注意力模块有效学习球谐系数的复杂相关性。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在高角分辨率FOD预测方面达到最佳性能，优于其他最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的3D多通道patch扩散模型能有效从低角分辨率dMRI预测高角分辨率FOD，为白质完整性表征提供了更高效准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion MRI (dMRI) is a critical non-invasive technique to estimate fiber orientation distribution (FOD) for characterizing white matter integrity. Estimating FOD from single-shell low angular resolution dMRI (LAR-FOD) is limited by accuracy, whereas estimating FOD from multi-shell high angular resolution dMRI (HAR-FOD) requires a long scanning time, which limits its applicability. Diffusion models have shown promise in estimating HAR-FOD based on LAR-FOD. However, using diffusion models to efficiently generate HAR-FOD is challenging due to the large number of spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients in FOD. Here, we propose a 3D multi-channel patch diffusion model to predict HAR-FOD from LAR-FOD. We design the FOD-patch adapter by introducing the prior brain anatomy for more efficient patch-based learning. Furthermore, we introduce a voxel-level conditional coordinating module to enhance the global understanding of the model. We design the SH attention module to effectively learn the complex correlations of the SH coefficients. Our experimental results show that our method achieves the best performance in HAR-FOD prediction and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有的开放词汇3D目标检测方法在训练和推理时仍依赖用户指定的类别，本文旨在研究真正自动化的3D目标检测，即无需任何用户输入自动生成检测对象的类别名称。

Method: 提出了语义评分（SS）来评估生成类别名称的质量，并开发了一个新框架AV3DOD，该框架利用2D视觉语言模型通过图像描述、伪3D框生成和特征空间语义扩展来生成丰富的语义候选。

Result: 在ScanNetV2和SUNRGB-D数据集上，AV3DOD在定位精度（mAP）和语义质量（SS）方面均达到SOTA。具体而言，在ScanNetV2上比SOTA方法CoDA提升了3.48总体mAP，并在SS上获得24.5%的相对改进。

Conclusion: AV3DOD框架成功地实现了完全自动化的3D目标检测，能够在没有用户指定类别的情况下生成高质量的语义类别，为开放词汇3D检测开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D object detection methods are able to localize 3D boxes of classes unseen during training. Despite the name, existing methods rely on user-specified classes both at training and inference. We propose to study Auto-Vocabulary 3D Object Detection (AV3DOD), where the classes are automatically generated for the detected objects without any user input. To this end, we introduce Semantic Score (SS) to evaluate the quality of the generated class names. We then develop a novel framework, AV3DOD, which leverages 2D vision-language models (VLMs) to generate rich semantic candidates through image captioning, pseudo 3D box generation, and feature-space semantics expansion. AV3DOD achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both localization (mAP) and semantic quality (SS) on the ScanNetV2 and SUNRGB-D datasets. Notably, it surpasses the SOTA, CoDA, by 3.48 overall mAP and attains a 24.5% relative improvement in SS on ScanNetV2.

Abstract: Human pose estimation is a crucial task in computer vision. Methods that have SOTA (State-of-the-Art) accuracy, often involve a large number of parameters and incur substantial computational cost. Many lightweight variants have been proposed to reduce the model size and computational cost of them. However, several of these methods still contain components that are not well suited for efficient deployment on edge devices. Moreover, models that primarily emphasize inference speed on edge devices often suffer from limited accuracy due to their overly simplified designs. To address these limitations, we propose LAPX, an Hourglass network with self-attention that captures global contextual information, based on previous work, LAP. In addition to adopting the self-attention module, LAPX advances the stage design and refine the lightweight attention modules. It achieves competitive results on two benchmark datasets, MPII and COCO, with only 2.3M parameters, and demonstrates real-time performance, confirming its edge-device suitability.

Abstract: Event cameras are a new type of brain-inspired visual sensor with advantages such as high dynamic range and high temporal resolution. The geometric calibration of event cameras, which involves determining their intrinsic and extrinsic parameters, particularly in long-range measurement scenarios, remains a significant challenge. To address the dual requirements of long-distance and high-precision measurement, we propose an event camera calibration method utilizing a collimator with flickering star-based patterns. The proposed method first linearly solves camera parameters using the sphere motion model of the collimator, followed by nonlinear optimization to refine these parameters with high precision. Through comprehensive real-world experiments across varying conditions, we demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing event camera calibration methods in terms of accuracy and reliability.

Abstract: Camera calibration is a crucial step in photogrammetry and 3D vision applications. This paper introduces a novel camera calibration method using a designed collimator system. Our collimator system provides a reliable and controllable calibration environment for the camera. Exploiting the unique optical geometry property of our collimator system, we introduce an angle invariance constraint and further prove that the relative motion between the calibration target and camera conforms to a spherical motion model. This constraint reduces the original 6DOF relative motion between target and camera to a 3DOF pure rotation motion. Using spherical motion constraint, a closed-form linear solver for multiple images and a minimal solver for two images are proposed for camera calibration. Furthermore, we propose a single collimator image calibration algorithm based on the angle invariance constraint. This algorithm eliminates the requirement for camera motion, providing a novel solution for flexible and fast calibration. The performance of our method is evaluated in both synthetic and real-world experiments, which verify the feasibility of calibration using the collimator system and demonstrate that our method is superior to existing baseline methods.

TL;DR: 提出CattleAct方法，通过将牛群互动行为分解为个体动作组合，实现从单张图像自动检测放牧牛的行为互动，应用于智慧畜牧管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智慧畜牧管理需要对牛群行为互动进行自动检测以支持发情检测等应用。现有研究主要关注人类互动检测，而放牧牛的互动是稀有事件，缺乏包含互动的全面行为数据集，这使得牛群互动检测成为具有挑战性的问题。

Conclusion: CattleAct方法通过数据高效的方式成功解决了牛群互动检测的挑战，为智慧畜牧管理提供了实用解决方案，代码已开源。

Abstract: This paper introduces a method and application for automatically detecting behavioral interactions between grazing cattle from a single image, which is essential for smart livestock management in the cattle industry, such as for detecting estrus. Although interaction detection for humans has been actively studied, a non-trivial challenge lies in cattle interaction detection, specifically the lack of a comprehensive behavioral dataset that includes interactions, as the interactions of grazing cattle are rare events. We, therefore, propose CattleAct, a data-efficient method for interaction detection by decomposing interactions into the combinations of actions by individual cattle. Specifically, we first learn an action latent space from a large-scale cattle action dataset. Then, we embed rare interactions via the fine-tuning of the pre-trained latent space using contrastive learning, thereby constructing a unified latent space of actions and interactions. On top of the proposed method, we develop a practical working system integrating video and GPS inputs. Experiments on a commercial-scale pasture demonstrate the accurate interaction detection achieved by our method compared to the baselines. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/rakawanegan/CattleAct.

Abstract: We propose a hybrid reconstruction framework for dual-spectral CT (DSCT) that integrates iterative methods with deep learning models. The reconstruction process consists of two complementary components: a knowledge-driven module and a data-driven module. In the knowledge-driven phase, we employ the oblique projection modification technique (OPMT) to reconstruct an intermediate solution of the basis material images from the projection data. We select OPMT for this role because of its fast convergence, which allows it to rapidly generate an intermediate solution that successfully achieves basis material decomposition. Subsequently, in the data-driven phase, we introduce a novel neural network, ResDynUNet++, to refine this intermediate solution. The ResDynUNet++ is built upon a UNet++ backbone by replacing standard convolutions with residual dynamic convolution blocks, which combine the adaptive, input-specific feature extraction of dynamic convolution with the stable training of residual connections. This architecture is designed to address challenges like channel imbalance and near-interface large artifacts in DSCT, producing clean and accurate final solutions. Extensive experiments on both synthetic phantoms and real clinical datasets validate the efficacy and superior performance of the proposed method.

Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation transfers knowledge from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain. Directly deploying Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with prompt tuning in downstream UDA tasks faces the signifi cant challenge of mitigating domain discrepancies. Existing prompt-tuning strategies primarily align marginal distribu tion, but neglect conditional distribution discrepancies, lead ing to critical issues such as class prototype misalignment and degraded semantic discriminability. To address these lim itations, the work proposes C-DGPA: Class-Centric Dual Alignment Generative Prompt Adaptation. C-DGPA syner gistically optimizes marginal distribution alignment and con ditional distribution alignment through a novel dual-branch architecture. The marginal distribution alignment branch em ploys a dynamic adversarial training framework to bridge marginal distribution discrepancies. Simultaneously, the con ditional distribution alignment branch introduces a Class Mapping Mechanism (CMM) to align conditional distribu tion discrepancies by standardizing semantic prompt under standing and preventing source domain over-reliance. This dual alignment strategy effectively integrates domain knowl edge into prompt learning via synergistic optimization, ensur ing domain-invariant and semantically discriminative repre sentations. Extensive experiments on OfficeHome, Office31, and VisDA-2017 validate the superiority of C-DGPA. It achieves new state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks.

Abstract: Although traditional cameras are the primary sensor for end-to-end driving, their performance suffers greatly when the conditions of the data they were trained on does not match the deployment environment, a problem known as the domain gap. In this work, we consider the day-night lighting difference domain gap. Instead of traditional cameras we propose event cameras as a potential alternative which can maintain performance across lighting condition domain gaps without requiring additional adjustments. Our results show that event cameras maintain more consistent performance across lighting conditions, exhibiting domain-shift penalties that are generally comparable to or smaller than grayscale frames and provide superior baseline performance in cross-domain scenarios.

Abstract: We present Avatar4D, a real-world transferable pipeline for generating customizable synthetic human motion datasets tailored to domain-specific applications. Unlike prior works, which focus on general, everyday motions and offer limited flexibility, our approach provides fine-grained control over body pose, appearance, camera viewpoint, and environmental context, without requiring any manual annotations. To validate the impact of Avatar4D, we focus on sports, where domain-specific human actions and movement patterns pose unique challenges for motion understanding. In this setting, we introduce Syn2Sport, a large-scale synthetic dataset spanning sports, including baseball and ice hockey. Avatar4D features high-fidelity 4D (3D geometry over time) human motion sequences with varying player appearances rendered in diverse environments. We benchmark several state-of-the-art pose estimation models on Syn2Sport and demonstrate their effectiveness for supervised learning, zero-shot transfer to real-world data, and generalization across sports. Furthermore, we evaluate how closely the generated synthetic data aligns with real-world datasets in feature space. Our results highlight the potential of such systems to generate scalable, controllable, and transferable human datasets for diverse domain-specific tasks without relying on domain-specific real data.

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) is a critical step toward automating healthcare workflows, facilitating accurate patient assessments, and reducing the workload of medical professionals. Despite recent progress in Large Medical Vision-Language Models (Med-VLMs), generating radiology reports that are both visually grounded and clinically accurate remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often rely on large labeled corpora for pre-training, costly task-specific preference data, or retrieval-based methods. However, these strategies do not adequately mitigate hallucinations arising from poor cross-modal alignment between visual and linguistic representations. To address these limitations, we propose VALOR:Visual Alignment of Medical Vision-Language Models for GrOunded Radiology Report Generation. Our method introduces a reinforcement learning-based post-alignment framework utilizing Group-Relative Proximal Optimization (GRPO). The training proceeds in two stages: (1) improving the Med-VLM with textual rewards to encourage clinically precise terminology, and (2) aligning the vision projection module of the textually grounded model with disease findings, thereby guiding attention toward image re gions most relevant to the diagnostic task. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that VALOR substantially improves factual accuracy and visual grounding, achieving significant performance gains over state-of-the-art report generation methods.

Abstract: Three-dimensional point clouds provide highly accurate digital representations of objects, essential for applications in computer graphics, photogrammetry, computer vision, and robotics. However, comparing point clouds faces significant challenges due to their unstructured nature and the complex geometry of the surfaces they represent. Traditional geometric metrics such as Hausdorff and Chamfer distances often fail to capture global statistical structure and exhibit sensitivity to outliers, while existing Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence approximations for Gaussian Mixture Models can produce unbounded or numerically unstable values. This paper introduces an information geometric framework for 3D point cloud shape analysis by representing point clouds as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) on a statistical manifold. We prove that the space of GMMs forms a statistical manifold and propose the Modified Symmetric Kullback-Leibler (MSKL) divergence with theoretically guaranteed upper and lower bounds, ensuring numerical stability for all GMM comparisons. Through comprehensive experiments on human pose discrimination (MPI-FAUST dataset) and animal shape comparison (G-PCD dataset), we demonstrate that MSKL provides stable and monotonically varying values that directly reflect geometric variation, outperforming traditional distances and existing KL approximations.

Abstract: Images are a substantial portion of the internet, making efficient compression important for reducing storage and bandwidth demands. This study investigates the use of Singular Value Decomposition and low-rank matrix approximations for image compression, evaluating performance using relative Frobenius error and compression ratio. The approach is applied to both grayscale and multichannel images to assess its generality. Results show that the low-rank approximations often produce images that appear visually similar to the originals, but the compression efficiency remains consistently worse than established formats such as JPEG, JPEG2000, and WEBP at comparable error levels. At low tolerated error levels, the compressed representation produced by Singular Value Decomposition can even exceed the size of the original image, indicating that this method is not competitive with industry-standard codecs for practical image compression.

Abstract: 3D human reaction generation faces three main challenges:(1) high motion fidelity, (2) real-time inference, and (3) autoregressive adaptability for online scenarios. Existing methods fail to meet all three simultaneously. We propose ARMFlow, a MeanFlow-based autoregressive framework that models temporal dependencies between actor and reactor motions. It consists of a causal context encoder and an MLP-based velocity predictor. We introduce Bootstrap Contextual Encoding (BSCE) in training, encoding generated history instead of the ground-truth ones, to alleviate error accumulation in autoregressive generation. We further introduce the offline variant ReMFlow, achieving state-of-the-art performance with the fastest inference among offline methods. Our ARMFlow addresses key limitations of online settings by: (1) enhancing semantic alignment via a global contextual encoder; (2) achieving high accuracy and low latency in a single-step inference; and (3) reducing accumulated errors through BSCE. Our single-step online generation surpasses existing online methods on InterHuman and InterX by over 40% in FID, while matching offline state-of-the-art performance despite using only partial sequence conditions.

Abstract: Multi-view crowd counting has been proposed to deal with the severe occlusion issue of crowd counting in large and wide scenes. However, due to the difficulty of collecting and annotating multi-view images, the datasets for multi-view counting have a limited number of multi-view frames and scenes. To solve the problem of limited data, one approach is to collect synthetic data to bypass the annotating step, while another is to propose semi- or weakly-supervised or unsupervised methods that demand less multi-view data. In this paper, we propose two semi-supervised multi-view crowd counting frameworks by ranking the multi-view fusion models of different numbers of input views, in terms of the model predictions or the model uncertainties. Specifically, for the first method (vanilla model), we rank the multi-view fusion models' prediction results of different numbers of camera-view inputs, namely, the model's predictions with fewer camera views shall not be larger than the predictions with more camera views. For the second method, we rank the estimated model uncertainties of the multi-view fusion models with a variable number of view inputs, guided by the multi-view fusion models' prediction errors, namely, the model uncertainties with more camera views shall not be larger than those with fewer camera views. These constraints are introduced into the model training in a semi-supervised fashion for multi-view counting with limited labeled data. The experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed multi-view model ranking methods compared with other semi-supervised counting methods.

Abstract: Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) is a powerful quantitative technique that provides metabolic and molecular contrast, offering strong translational potential for label-free, real-time diagnostics. However, its clinical adoption remains limited by long pixel dwell times and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), which impose a stricter resolution-speed trade-off than conventional optical imaging approaches. Here, we introduce FLIM_PSR_k, a deep learning-based multi-channel pixel super-resolution (PSR) framework that reconstructs high-resolution FLIM images from data acquired with up to a 5-fold increased pixel size. The model is trained using the conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) framework, which, compared to diffusion model-based alternatives, delivers a more robust PSR reconstruction with substantially shorter inference times, a crucial advantage for practical deployment. FLIM_PSR_k not only enables faster image acquisition but can also alleviate SNR limitations in autofluorescence-based FLIM. Blind testing on held-out patient-derived tumor tissue samples demonstrates that FLIM_PSR_k reliably achieves a super-resolution factor of k = 5, resulting in a 25-fold increase in the space-bandwidth product of the output images and revealing fine architectural features lost in lower-resolution inputs, with statistically significant improvements across various image quality metrics. By increasing FLIM's effective spatial resolution, FLIM_PSR_k advances lifetime imaging toward faster, higher-resolution, and hardware-flexible implementations compatible with low-numerical-aperture and miniaturized platforms, better positioning FLIM for translational applications.

Abstract: Text rendering has recently emerged as one of the most challenging frontiers in visual generation, drawing significant attention from large-scale diffusion and multimodal models. However, text editing within images remains largely unexplored, as it requires generating legible characters while preserving semantic, geometric, and contextual coherence. To fill this gap, we introduce TextEditBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark that explicitly focuses on text-centric regions in images. Beyond basic pixel manipulations, our benchmark emphasizes reasoning-intensive editing scenarios that require models to understand physical plausibility, linguistic meaning, and cross-modal dependencies. We further propose a novel evaluation dimension, Semantic Expectation (SE), which measures reasoning ability of model to maintain semantic consistency, contextual coherence, and cross-modal alignment during text editing. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art editing systems reveal that while current models can follow simple textual instructions, they still struggle with context-dependent reasoning, physical consistency, and layout-aware integration. By focusing evaluation on this long-overlooked yet fundamental capability, TextEditBench establishes a new testing ground for advancing text-guided image editing and reasoning in multimodal generation.

Abstract: Automated floor plan generation lies at the intersection of combinatorial search, geometric constraint satisfaction, and functional design requirements -- a confluence that has historically resisted a unified computational treatment. While recent deep learning approaches have improved the state of the art, they often struggle to capture architectural reasoning: the precedence of topological relationships over geometric instantiation, the propagation of functional constraints through adjacency networks, and the emergence of circulation patterns from local connectivity decisions. To address these fundamental challenges, this paper introduces GFLAN, a generative framework that restructures floor plan synthesis through explicit factorization into topological planning and geometric realization. Given a single exterior boundary and a front-door location, our approach departs from direct pixel-to-pixel or wall-tracing generation in favor of a principled two-stage decomposition. Stage A employs a specialized convolutional architecture with dual encoders -- separating invariant spatial context from evolving layout state -- to sequentially allocate room centroids within the building envelope via discrete probability maps over feasible placements. Stage B constructs a heterogeneous graph linking room nodes to boundary vertices, then applies a Transformer-augmented graph neural network (GNN) that jointly regresses room boundaries.

Abstract: Semantic overlap among land-cover categories, highly imbalanced label distributions, and complex inter-class co-occurrence patterns constitute significant challenges for multi-label remote-sensing image retrieval. In this article, Multi-Label Adaptive Contrastive Learning (MACL) is introduced as an extension of contrastive learning to address them. It integrates label-aware sampling, frequency-sensitive weighting, and dynamic-temperature scaling to achieve balanced representation learning across both common and rare categories. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (DLRSD, ML-AID, and WHDLD), show that MACL consistently outperforms contrastive-loss based baselines, effectively mitigating semantic imbalance and delivering more reliable retrieval performance in large-scale remote-sensing archives. Code, pretrained models, and evaluation scripts will be released at https://github.com/amna/MACL upon acceptance.

Abstract: Tracking and measuring targets using a variety of sensors mounted on UAVs is an effective means to quickly and accurately locate the target. This paper proposes a fusion localization method based on ridge estimation, combining the advantages of rich scene information from sequential imagery with the high precision of laser ranging to enhance localization accuracy. Under limited conditions such as long distances, small intersection angles, and large inclination angles, the column vectors of the design matrix have serious multicollinearity when using the least squares estimation algorithm. The multicollinearity will lead to ill-conditioned problems, resulting in significant instability and low robustness. Ridge estimation is introduced to mitigate the serious multicollinearity under the condition of limited observation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves higher localization accuracy compared to ground localization algorithms based on single information. Moreover, the introduction of ridge estimation effectively enhances the robustness, particularly under limited observation conditions.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of achieving optimal Quality of Information (QoI) in non-dedicated vehicular mobile crowdsensing (NVMCS) systems. The key obstacles are the interrelated issues of sensing coverage, sensing reliability, and the dynamic participation of vehicles. To tackle these, we propose QUIDS, a QUality-informed Incentive-driven multi-agent Dispatching System, which ensures high sensing coverage and reliability under budget constraints. QUIDS introduces a novel metric, Aggregated Sensing Quality (ASQ), to quantitatively capture QoI by integrating both coverage and reliability. We also develop a Mutually Assisted Belief-aware Vehicle Dispatching algorithm that estimates sensing reliability and allocates incentives under uncertainty, further improving ASQ. Evaluation using real-world data from a metropolitan NVMCS deployment shows QUIDS improves ASQ by 38% over non-dispatching scenarios and by 10% over state-of-the-art methods. It also reduces reconstruction map errors by 39-74% across algorithms. By jointly optimizing coverage and reliability via a quality-informed incentive mechanism, QUIDS enables low-cost, high-quality urban monitoring without dedicated infrastructure, applicable to smart-city scenarios like traffic and environmental sensing.

Motivation: 传统部署中，边缘设备将原始图像传输到服务器进行VLM推理时，为匹配视觉编码器输入分辨率而调整图像尺寸会丢失细节信息，导致准确性下降。同时，传输完整高分辨率图像又会带来巨大通信开销。

Method: 设计两阶段框架：1) 服务器对全局图像进行初始推理，利用VLM内部注意力机制识别感兴趣区域(RoI)；2) 计算输出令牌的最小熵作为置信度指标，若超过预定阈值则请求边缘设备发送RoI的细节保留局部图像；3) 服务器结合全局和局部图像进行精炼推理。

Result: 在多种VLM架构上的实验表明，该框架在保持推理准确性的同时显著降低了通信成本。

Conclusion: 提出的协作边缘-服务器推理框架通过选择性重传机制，解决了VLM部署中精度与通信开销的权衡问题，为资源受限的边缘设备部署大型VLM提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a collaborative edge-to-server inference framework for vision-language models (VLMs) that reduces the communication cost while maintaining inference accuracy. In typical deployments, visual data captured at edge devices (clients) is transmitted to the server for VLM inference. However, resizing the original image (global image) to match the vision encoder's input resolution often discards fine-grained details, leading to accuracy degradation. To overcome this limitation, we design a two-stage framework. In the first stage, the server performs inference on the global image and identifies a region of interest (RoI) using the VLM's internal attention. The min-entropy of the output tokens is then computed as a confidence measure to determine whether retransmission is required. If the min-entropy exceeds a predefined threshold, the server requests the edge device to send a detail-preserved local image of the RoI. The server then refines its inference by jointly leveraging the global and local images. This selective retransmission strategy ensures that only essential visual content is transmitted. Experiments across multiple VLM architectures show that the proposed framework significantly reduces communication cost while maintaining inference accuracy.

Abstract: Pre-trained Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) have recently shown strong perceptual priors for low-level vision tasks, making them a promising direction for multi-exposure High Dynamic Range (HDR) reconstruction. However, directly applying LDMs to HDR remains challenging due to: (1) limited dynamic-range representation caused by 8-bit latent compression, (2) high inference cost from multi-step denoising, and (3) content hallucination inherent to generative nature. To address these challenges, we introduce GMODiff, a gain map-driven one-step diffusion framework for multi-exposure HDR reconstruction. Instead of reconstructing full HDR content, we reformulate HDR reconstruction as a conditionally guided Gain Map (GM) estimation task, where the GM encodes the extended dynamic range while retaining the same bit depth as LDR images. We initialize the denoising process from an informative regression-based estimate rather than pure noise, enabling the model to generate high-quality GMs in a single denoising step. Furthermore, recognizing that regression-based models excel in content fidelity while LDMs favor perceptual quality, we leverage regression priors to guide both the denoising process and latent decoding of the LDM, suppressing hallucinations while preserving structural accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our GMODiff performs favorably against several state-of-the-art methods and is 100 faster than previous LDM-based methods.

TL;DR: EverybodyDance提出了一个解决多角色动画中身份对应性（IC）问题的系统化方案，通过构建身份匹配图（IMG）和提出Mask-Query Attention（MQA）等机制来确保角色在参考帧和生成帧之间的正确身份对应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的姿态驱动角色动画在单角色场景中取得了显著进展，但扩展到多角色场景（特别是涉及位置交换的情况）面临挑战，核心问题在于确保参考帧和生成帧之间角色身份对应性（IC）的正确性。

Method: 1）构建身份匹配图（IMG）：将参考帧和生成帧中的角色建模为加权完全二分图的两个节点集；2）Mask-Query Attention（MQA）：计算节点间权重，量化角色对的相似度；3）将IC正确性转化为图结构度量并在训练中优化；4）提出针对多角色动画的系列策略：身份嵌入引导、多尺度匹配策略和预分类采样。

Result: 作者创建了专门用于评估多角色IC正确性的Identity Correspondence Evaluation基准测试。大量实验表明，EverybodyDance在身份对应性和视觉保真度上都显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: EverybodyDance通过系统化方法成功解决了多角色动画中的身份对应性问题，其核心创新在于将IC问题形式化为图结构优化，并结合多项针对性策略实现了优越的性能表现。

Abstract: Consistent pose-driven character animation has achieved remarkable progress in single-character scenarios. However, extending these advances to multi-character settings is non-trivial, especially when position swap is involved. Beyond mere scaling, the core challenge lies in enforcing correct Identity Correspondence (IC) between characters in reference and generated frames. To address this, we introduce EverybodyDance, a systematic solution targeting IC correctness in multi-character animation. EverybodyDance is built around the Identity Matching Graph (IMG), which models characters in the generated and reference frames as two node sets in a weighted complete bipartite graph. Edge weights, computed via our proposed Mask-Query Attention (MQA), quantify the affinity between each pair of characters. Our key insight is to formalize IC correctness as a graph structural metric and to optimize it during training. We also propose a series of targeted strategies tailored for multi-character animation, including identity-embedded guidance, a multi-scale matching strategy, and pre-classified sampling, which work synergistically. Finally, to evaluate IC performance, we curate the Identity Correspondence Evaluation benchmark, dedicated to multi-character IC correctness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EverybodyDance substantially outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both IC and visual fidelity.

Abstract: State-of-the-art Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models can generate visually impressive results, yet they still frequently fail to compose complex scenes or follow logical temporal instructions. In this paper, we argue that many errors, including apparent motion failures, originate from the model's inability to construct a semantically correct or logically consistent initial frame. We introduce Factorized Video Generation (FVG), a pipeline that decouples these tasks by decomposing the Text-to-Video generation into three specialized stages: (1) Reasoning, where a Large Language Model (LLM) rewrites the video prompt to describe only the initial scene, resolving temporal ambiguities; (2) Composition, where a Text-to-Image (T2I) model synthesizes a high-quality, compositionally-correct anchor frame from this new prompt; and (3) Temporal Synthesis, where a video model, finetuned to understand this anchor, focuses its entire capacity on animating the scene and following the prompt. Our decomposed approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the T2V CompBench benchmark and significantly improves all tested models on VBench2. Furthermore, we show that visual anchoring allows us to cut the number of sampling steps by 70% without any loss in performance, leading to a substantial speed-up in sampling. Factorized Video Generation offers a simple yet practical path toward more efficient, robust, and controllable video synthesis

TL;DR: BrepLLM是一个将LLM适用于直接处理3D边界表示（Brep）模型的框架，它通过跨模态对齐预训练和多阶段微调，解决了3D几何与自然语言之间的模态差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于词序列的大型语言模型（LLM）难以直接处理含有复杂几何和拓扑信息的3D Brep模型，因此需要一种新的框架来桥接结构化3D几何与自然语言之间的模态差距。

Method: BrepLLM采用两阶段训练流程：1）跨模态对齐预训练：通过自适应UV采样将Breps转换为图表示，然后使用分层BrepEncoder提取几何和拓扑特征，生成全局token和节点token序列，并通过对比学习与CLIP文本编码器对齐。2）多阶段LLM微调：将预训练的BrepEncoder集成到LLM中，通过三阶段渐进训练策略（语义映射到2D、LLM微调、混合查询专家MQE）对齐节点token序列。

Result: BrepLLM在3D物体分类和描述任务上获得了最先进（SOTA）的性能表现。

Conclusion: BrepLLM是第一个能够直接解析和推理原始Brep数据的框架，成功地将LLM应用于复杂3D几何和拓扑信息处理，并在相关任务上取得了最优结果。

Abstract: Current token-sequence-based Large Language Models (LLMs) are not well-suited for directly processing 3D Boundary Representation (Brep) models that contain complex geometric and topological information. We propose BrepLLM, the first framework that enables LLMs to parse and reason over raw Brep data, bridging the modality gap between structured 3D geometry and natural language. BrepLLM employs a two-stage training pipeline: Cross-modal Alignment Pre-training and Multi-stage LLM Fine-tuning. In the first stage, an adaptive UV sampling strategy converts Breps into graphs representation with geometric and topological information. We then design a hierarchical BrepEncoder to extract features from geometry (i.e., faces and edges) and topology, producing both a single global token and a sequence of node tokens. Then we align the global token with text embeddings from a frozen CLIP text encoder (ViT-L/14) via contrastive learning. In the second stage, we integrate the pretrained BrepEncoder into an LLM. We then align its sequence of node tokens using a three-stage progressive training strategy: (1) training an MLP-based semantic mapping from Brep representation to 2D with 2D-LLM priors. (2) performing fine-tuning of the LLM. (3) designing a Mixture-of-Query Experts (MQE) to enhance geometric diversity modeling. We also construct Brep2Text, a dataset comprising 269,444 Brep-text question-answer pairs. Experiments show that BrepLLM achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on 3D object classification and captioning tasks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Object counting in complex scenes remains challenging, particularly in the zero-shot setting, where the goal is to count instances of unseen categories specified only by a class name. Existing zero-shot object counting (ZOC) methods that infer exemplars from text either rely on open-vocabulary detectors, which often yield multi-instance candidates, or on random patch sampling, which fails to accurately delineate object instances. To address this, we propose CountZES, a training-free framework for object counting via zero-shot exemplar selection. CountZES progressively discovers diverse exemplars through three synergistic stages: Detection-Anchored Exemplar (DAE), Density-Guided Exemplar (DGE), and Feature-Consensus Exemplar (FCE). DAE refines open-vocabulary detections to isolate precise single-instance exemplars. DGE introduces a density-driven, self-supervised paradigm to identify statistically consistent and semantically compact exemplars, while FCE reinforces visual coherence through feature-space clustering. Together, these stages yield a diverse, complementary exemplar set that balances textual grounding, count consistency, and feature representativeness. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate CountZES superior performance among ZOC methods while generalizing effectively across natural, aerial and medical domains.

Conclusion: 通过几何层面的文本嵌入优化，能够高效且无需训练地解决扩散模型中跨图像生成的语义泄漏问题，为视觉叙事等应用提供可靠方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images from natural language descriptions but often fail to preserve subject consistency across multiple outputs, limiting their use in visual storytelling. Existing approaches rely on model fine-tuning or image conditioning, which are computationally expensive and require per-subject optimization. 1Prompt1Story, a training-free approach, concatenates all scene descriptions into a single prompt and rescales token embeddings, but it suffers from semantic leakage, where embeddings across frames become entangled, causing text misalignment. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective training-free approach that addresses semantic entanglement from a geometric perspective by refining text embeddings to suppress unwanted semantics. Extensive experiments prove that our approach significantly improves both subject consistency and text alignment over existing baselines.

Abstract: Human motion generation is a challenging task that aims to create realistic motion imitating natural human behaviour. We focus on the well-studied behaviour of priming an object/location for pick up or put down -- that is, the spotting of an object/location from a distance, known as gaze priming, followed by the motion of approaching and reaching the target location. To that end, we curate, for the first time, 23.7K gaze-primed human motion sequences for reaching target object locations from five publicly available datasets, i.e., HD-EPIC, MoGaze, HOT3D, ADT, and GIMO. We pre-train a text-conditioned diffusion-based motion generation model, then fine-tune it conditioned on goal pose or location, on our curated sequences. Importantly, we evaluate the ability of the generated motion to imitate natural human movement through several metrics, including the 'Reach Success' and a newly introduced 'Prime Success' metric. On the largest dataset, HD-EPIC, our model achieves 60% prime success and 89% reach success when conditioned on the goal object location.

Conclusion: 阶段感知设计是高效视觉自回归图像生成的强大原则，StageVAR为解决VAR模型计算效率问题提供了一种系统化解决方案。

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive (VAR) modeling departs from the next-token prediction paradigm of traditional Autoregressive (AR) models through next-scale prediction, enabling high-quality image generation. However, the VAR paradigm suffers from sharply increased computational complexity and running time at large-scale steps. Although existing acceleration methods reduce runtime for large-scale steps, but rely on manual step selection and overlook the varying importance of different stages in the generation process. To address this challenge, we present StageVAR, a systematic study and stage-aware acceleration framework for VAR models. Our analysis shows that early steps are critical for preserving semantic and structural consistency and should remain intact, while later steps mainly refine details and can be pruned or approximated for acceleration. Building on these insights, StageVAR introduces a plug-and-play acceleration strategy that exploits semantic irrelevance and low-rank properties in late-stage computations, without requiring additional training. Our proposed StageVAR achieves up to 3.4x speedup with only a 0.01 drop on GenEval and a 0.26 decrease on DPG, consistently outperforming existing acceleration baselines. These results highlight stage-aware design as a powerful principle for efficient visual autoregressive image generation.

Abstract: Humans assess image quality through a perception-reasoning cascade, integrating sensory cues with implicit reasoning to form self-consistent judgments. In this work, we investigate how a model can acquire both human-like and self-consistent reasoning capability for blind image quality assessment (BIQA). We first collect human evaluation data that capture several aspects of human perception-reasoning pipeline. Then, we adopt reinforcement learning, using human annotations as reward signals to guide the model toward human-like perception and reasoning. To enable the model to internalize self-consistent reasoning capability, we design a reward that drives the model to infer the image quality purely from self-generated descriptions. Empirically, our approach achieves score prediction performance comparable to state-of-the-art BIQA systems under general metrics, including Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients. In addition to the rating score, we assess human-model alignment using ROUGE-1 to measure the similarity between model-generated and human perception-reasoning chains. On over 1,000 human-annotated samples, our model reaches a ROUGE-1 score of 0.512 (cf. 0.443 for baseline), indicating substantial coverage of human explanations and marking a step toward human-like interpretable reasoning in BIQA.

Abstract: Emotion Recognition (ER) is the process of analyzing and identifying human emotions from sensing data. Currently, the field heavily relies on facial expression recognition (FER) because visual channel conveys rich emotional cues. However, facial expressions are often used as social tools rather than manifestations of genuine inner emotions. To understand and bridge this gap between FER and ER, we introduce eye behaviors as an important emotional cue and construct an Eye-behavior-aided Multimodal Emotion Recognition (EMER) dataset. To collect data with genuine emotions, spontaneous emotion induction paradigm is exploited with stimulus material, during which non-invasive eye behavior data, like eye movement sequences and eye fixation maps, is captured together with facial expression videos. To better illustrate the gap between ER and FER, multi-view emotion labels for mutimodal ER and FER are separately annotated. Furthermore, based on the new dataset, we design a simple yet effective Eye-behavior-aided MER Transformer (EMERT) that enhances ER by bridging the emotion gap. EMERT leverages modality-adversarial feature decoupling and a multitask Transformer to model eye behaviors as a strong complement to facial expressions. In the experiment, we introduce seven multimodal benchmark protocols for a variety of comprehensive evaluations of the EMER dataset. The results show that the EMERT outperforms other state-of-the-art multimodal methods by a great margin, revealing the importance of modeling eye behaviors for robust ER. To sum up, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the importance of eye behaviors in ER, advancing the study on addressing the gap between FER and ER for more robust ER performance. Our EMER dataset and the trained EMERT models will be publicly available at https://github.com/kejun1/EMER.

Abstract: The processing of omnidirectional 360-degree images poses significant challenges for object detection due to inherent spatial distortions, wide fields of view, and ultra-high-resolution inputs. Conventional detectors such as YOLO are optimised for standard image sizes (for example, 640x640 pixels) and often struggle with the computational demands of 4K or higher-resolution imagery typical of 360-degree vision. To address these limitations, we introduce YOLO11-4K, an efficient real-time detection framework tailored for 4K panoramic images. The architecture incorporates a novel multi-scale detection head with a P2 layer to improve sensitivity to small objects often missed at coarser scales, and a GhostConv-based backbone to reduce computational complexity without sacrificing representational power. To enable evaluation, we manually annotated the CVIP360 dataset, generating 6,876 frame-level bounding boxes and producing a publicly available, detection-ready benchmark for 4K panoramic scenes. YOLO11-4K achieves 0.95 mAP at 0.50 IoU with 28.3 milliseconds inference per frame, representing a 75 percent latency reduction compared to YOLO11 (112.3 milliseconds), while also improving accuracy (mAP at 0.50 of 0.95 versus 0.908). This balance of efficiency and precision enables robust object detection in expansive 360-degree environments, making the framework suitable for real-world high-resolution panoramic applications. While this work focuses on 4K omnidirectional images, the approach is broadly applicable to high-resolution detection tasks in autonomous navigation, surveillance, and augmented reality.

Abstract: Chest X-ray imaging is commonly used to diagnose pneumonia, but accurately localizing the pneumonia-affected regions typically requires detailed pixel-level annotations, which are costly and time consuming to obtain. To address this limitation, this study proposes a weakly supervised deep learning framework for pneumonia classification and localization using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). Instead of relying on costly pixel-level annotations, the proposed method utilizes image-level labels to generate clinically meaningful heatmaps that highlight pneumonia-affected regions. Furthermore, we evaluate seven pre-trained deep learning models, including a Vision Transformer, under identical training conditions, using focal loss and patient-wise splits to prevent data leakage. Experimental results suggest that all models achieved high classification accuracy (96--98\%), with ResNet-18 and EfficientNet-B0 showing the best overall performance and MobileNet-V3 providing an efficient lightweight alternative. Grad-CAM heatmap visualizations confirm that the proposed methods focus on clinically relevant lung regions, supporting the use of explainable AI for radiological diagnostics. Overall, this work highlights the potential of weakly supervised, explainable models that enhance transparency and clinical trust in AI-assisted pneumonia screening.

Abstract: The lifting-based methods have dominated monocular 3D human pose estimation by leveraging detected 2D poses as intermediate representations. The 2D component of the final 3D human pose benefits from the detected 2D poses, whereas its depth counterpart must be estimated from scratch. The lifting-based methods encode the detected 2D pose and unknown depth in an entangled feature space, explicitly introducing depth uncertainty to the detected 2D pose, thereby limiting overall estimation accuracy. This work reveals that the depth representation is pivotal for the estimation process. Specifically, when depth is in an initial, completely unknown state, jointly encoding depth features with 2D pose features is detrimental to the estimation process. In contrast, when depth is initially refined to a more dependable state via network-based estimation, encoding it together with 2D pose information is beneficial. To address this limitation, we present a Mixture-of-Experts network for monocular 3D pose estimation named PoseMoE. Our approach introduces: (1) A mixture-of-experts network where specialized expert modules refine the well-detected 2D pose features and learn the depth features. This mixture-of-experts design disentangles the feature encoding process for 2D pose and depth, therefore reducing the explicit influence of uncertain depth features on 2D pose features. (2) A cross-expert knowledge aggregation module is proposed to aggregate cross-expert spatio-temporal contextual information. This step enhances features through bidirectional mapping between 2D pose and depth. Extensive experiments show that our proposed PoseMoE outperforms the conventional lifting-based methods on three widely used datasets: Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW.

VenusBench-GD contributes as follows: (i) we introduce a large-scale, cross-platform benchmark with extensive coverage of applications, diverse UI elements, and rich annotated data, (ii) we establish a high-quality data construction pipeline for grounding tasks, achieving higher annotation accuracy than existing benchmarks, and (iii) we extend the scope of element grounding by proposing a hierarchical task taxonomy that divides grounding into basic and advanced categories, encompassing six distinct subtasks designed to evaluate models from complementary perspectives. Our experimental findings reveal critical insights: general-purpose multimodal models now match or even surpass specialized GUI models on basic grounding tasks. In contrast, advanced tasks, still favor GUI-specialized models, though they exhibit significant overfitting and poor robustness. These results underscore the necessity of comprehensive, multi-tiered evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: The self-supervised pretraining paradigm has achieved great success in learning 3D action representations for skeleton-based action recognition using contrastive learning. However, learning effective representations for skeleton-based temporal action localization remains challenging and underexplored. Unlike video-level {action} recognition, detecting action boundaries requires temporally sensitive features that capture subtle differences between adjacent frames where labels change. To this end, we formulate a snippet discrimination pretext task for self-supervised pretraining, which densely projects skeleton sequences into non-overlapping segments and promotes features that distinguish them across videos via contrastive learning. Additionally, we build on strong backbones of skeleton-based action recognition models by fusing intermediate features with a U-shaped module to enhance feature resolution for frame-level localization. Our approach consistently improves existing skeleton-based contrastive learning methods for action localization on BABEL across diverse subsets and evaluation protocols. We also achieve state-of-the-art transfer learning performance on PKUMMD with pretraining on NTU RGB+D and BABEL.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have achieved impressive zero-shot recognition performance but remain highly susceptible to adversarial perturbations, posing significant risks in safety-critical scenarios. Previous training-time defenses rely on adversarial fine-tuning, which requires labeled data and costly retraining, while existing test-time strategies fail to reliably distinguish between clean and adversarial inputs, thereby preventing both adversarial robustness and clean accuracy from reaching their optimum. To address these limitations, we propose Test-Time Padding (TTP), a lightweight defense framework that performs adversarial detection followed by targeted adaptation at inference. TTP identifies adversarial inputs via the cosine similarity shift between CLIP feature embeddings computed before and after spatial padding, yielding a universal threshold for reliable detection across architectures and datasets. For detected adversarial cases, TTP employs trainable padding to restore disrupted attention patterns, coupled with a similarity-aware ensemble strategy for a more robust final prediction. For clean inputs, TTP leaves them unchanged by default or optionally integrates existing test-time adaptation techniques for further accuracy gains. Comprehensive experiments on diverse CLIP backbones and fine-grained benchmarks show that TTP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art test-time defenses, delivering substantial improvements in adversarial robustness without compromising clean accuracy. The code for this paper will be released soon.

Abstract: While current multimodal models can answer questions based on 2D images, they lack intrinsic 3D object perception, limiting their ability to comprehend spatial relationships and depth cues in 3D scenes. In this work, we propose N3D-VLM, a novel unified framework that seamlessly integrates native 3D object perception with 3D-aware visual reasoning, enabling both precise 3D grounding and interpretable spatial understanding. Unlike conventional end-to-end models that directly predict answers from RGB/RGB-D inputs, our approach equips the model with native 3D object perception capabilities, enabling it to directly localize objects in 3D space based on textual descriptions. Building upon accurate 3D object localization, the model further performs explicit reasoning in 3D, achieving more interpretable and structured spatial understanding. To support robust training for these capabilities, we develop a scalable data construction pipeline that leverages depth estimation to lift large-scale 2D annotations into 3D space, significantly increasing the diversity and coverage for 3D object grounding data, yielding over six times larger than the largest existing single-image 3D detection dataset. Moreover, the pipeline generates spatial question-answering datasets that target chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in 3D, facilitating joint training for both 3D object localization and 3D spatial reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified framework not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D grounding tasks, but also consistently surpasses existing methods in 3D spatial reasoning in vision-language model.

Motivation: 现有方法通常只能重建当前可见的场景部分，无法处理遮挡或临时不可见的物体，缺乏对动态场景的持久化重建能力。研究者希望开发一个能实现完全场景重建和物体持久追踪的系统。

Method: 将场景分解为刚性3D基元，通过估计的密集2D对应关系联合推断这些基元的刚性运动，并引入运动外推机制处理消失物体，使用运动分组技术保持连续性。

Result: 在物体扫描和多物体数据集上，该系统在定量和定性评估中都显著优于现有方法，实现了4D时空感知能力。

Conclusion: 该系统能够从单目视频中重建动态场景的完整4D表示，包括可见和不可见部分，为可重放3D重建、多物体扫描和物体持久化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present a dynamic reconstruction system that receives a casual monocular RGB video as input, and outputs a complete and persistent reconstruction of the scene. In other words, we reconstruct not only the the currently visible parts of the scene, but also all previously viewed parts, which enables replaying the complete reconstruction across all timesteps.
  Our method decomposes the scene into a set of rigid 3D primitives, which are assumed to be moving throughout the scene. Using estimated dense 2D correspondences, we jointly infer the rigid motion of these primitives through an optimisation pipeline, yielding a 4D reconstruction of the scene, i.e. providing 3D geometry dynamically moving through time. To achieve this, we also introduce a mechanism to extrapolate motion for objects that become invisible, employing motion-grouping techniques to maintain continuity.
  The resulting system enables 4D spatio-temporal awareness, offering capabilities such as replayable 3D reconstructions of articulated objects through time, multi-object scanning, and object permanence. On object scanning and multi-object datasets, our system significantly outperforms existing methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Abstract: Fine-tuning Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) with a small number of parameters has shown remarkable performance in Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS). Most existing works either train lightweight adapters or refine intermediate features to achieve better generalization on unseen domains. However, they both overlook the fact that long-term pre-trained VFMs often exhibit artifacts, which hinder the utilization of valuable representations and ultimately degrade DGSS performance. Inspired by causal mechanisms, we observe that these artifacts are associated with non-causal factors, which usually reside in the low- and high-frequency components of the VFM spectrum. In this paper, we explicitly examine the causal and non-causal factors of features within VFMs for DGSS, and propose a simple yet effective method to identify and disentangle them, enabling more robust domain generalization. Specifically, we propose Causal-Tune, a novel fine-tuning strategy designed to extract causal factors and suppress non-causal ones from the features of VFMs. First, we extract the frequency spectrum of features from each layer using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). A Gaussian band-pass filter is then applied to separate the spectrum into causal and non-causal components. To further refine the causal components, we introduce a set of causal-aware learnable tokens that operate in the frequency domain, while the non-causal components are discarded. Finally, refined features are transformed back into the spatial domain via inverse DCT and passed to the next layer. Extensive experiments conducted on various cross-domain tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of Causal-Tune. In particular, our method achieves superior performance under adverse weather conditions, improving +4.8% mIoU over the baseline in snow conditions.

Conclusion: 该框架为多上下文连续时间预测提供了首个统一的3D医学数据预测解决方案，作者将发布代码和评估协议以促进可复现的多数据集基准测试。

Abstract: Forecasting how 3D medical scans evolve over time is important for disease progression, treatment planning, and developmental assessment. Yet existing models either rely on a single prior scan, fixed grid times, or target global labels, which limits voxel-level forecasting under irregular sampling. We present CRONOS, a unified framework for many-to-one prediction from multiple past scans that supports both discrete (grid-based) and continuous (real-valued) timestamps in one model, to the best of our knowledge the first to achieve continuous sequence-to-image forecasting for 3D medical data. CRONOS learns a spatio-temporal velocity field that transports context volumes toward a target volume at an arbitrary time, while operating directly in 3D voxel space. Across three public datasets spanning Cine-MRI, perfusion CT, and longitudinal MRI, CRONOS outperforms other baselines, while remaining computationally competitive. We will release code and evaluation protocols to enable reproducible, multi-dataset benchmarking of multi-context, continuous-time forecasting.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的统一多模态推理范式，通过在推理过程中生成连续的视觉嵌入（称为潜在草图标记）来实现视觉想象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型擅长基于文本推理的视觉理解任务，但在需要视觉想象的场景中表现不足。人类能够在没有预定义工具包的情况下进行灵活的视觉-文本想象和交互，这是因为人类在大脑的统一空间中构建视觉-文本思考过程。当前MLLMs已经在同一特征空间中编码了视觉和文本信息，因此视觉标记可以无缝地插入到文本标记携带的推理过程中。

Method: 本文提出了Sketch-in-Latents (SkiLa)方法，通过扩展MLLMs的自回归能力，使其能够本地生成连续的视觉嵌入（即潜在草图标记）。在多步推理过程中，模型在文本思考模式（生成文本思考标记）和视觉草图模式（生成潜在草图标记）之间动态切换。此外，还提出了潜在视觉语义重建机制来确保这些潜在草图标记具有语义基础。

Result: 大量实验表明，SkiLa在视觉中心任务上取得了优异性能，同时在多样化的通用多模态基准测试上表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SkiLa通过将视觉和文本推理统一在同一空间中，实现了多模态大语言模型的视觉想象能力，为需要视觉想象的任务提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual understanding tasks through text reasoning, they often fall short in scenarios requiring visual imagination. Unlike current works that take predefined external toolkits or generate images during thinking, however, humans can form flexible visual-text imagination and interactions during thinking without predefined toolkits, where one important reason is that humans construct the visual-text thinking process in a unified space inside the brain. Inspired by this capability, given that current MLLMs already encode visual and text information in the same feature space, we hold that visual tokens can be seamlessly inserted into the reasoning process carried by text tokens, where ideally, all visual imagination processes can be encoded by the latent features. To achieve this goal, we propose Sketch-in-Latents (SkiLa), a novel paradigm for unified multi-modal reasoning that expands the auto-regressive capabilities of MLLMs to natively generate continuous visual embeddings, termed latent sketch tokens, as visual thoughts. During multi-step reasoning, the model dynamically alternates between textual thinking mode for generating textual think tokens and visual sketching mode for generating latent sketch tokens. A latent visual semantics reconstruction mechanism is proposed to ensure these latent sketch tokens are semantically grounded. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SkiLa achieves superior performance on vision-centric tasks while exhibiting strong generalization to diverse general multi-modal benchmarks. Codes will be released at https://github.com/TungChintao/SkiLa.

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown remarkable capacity in image synthesis based on their U-shaped architecture and convolutional neural networks (CNN) as basic blocks. The locality of the convolution operation in CNN may limit the model's ability to understand long-range semantic information. To address this issue, we propose Yuan-TecSwin, a text-conditioned diffusion model with Swin-transformer in this work. The Swin-transformer blocks take the place of CNN blocks in the encoder and decoder, to improve the non-local modeling ability in feature extraction and image restoration. The text-image alignment is improved with a well-chosen text encoder, effective utilization of text embedding, and careful design in the incorporation of text condition. Using an adapted time step to search in different diffusion stages, inference performance is further improved by 10%. Yuan-TecSwin achieves the state-of-the-art FID score of 1.37 on ImageNet generation benchmark, without any additional models at different denoising stages. In a side-by-side comparison, we find it difficult for human interviewees to tell the model-generated images from the human-painted ones.

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) set the state of the art in visual generation, yet their quadratic self-attention cost fundamentally limits scaling to long token sequences. Recent Top-K sparse attention approaches reduce the computation of DiTs by compressing tokens into block-wise representation and selecting a small set of relevant key blocks, but still suffer from (i) quadratic selection cost on compressed tokens and (ii) increasing K required to maintain model quality as sequences grow. We identify that their inefficiency is due to the single-level design, as a single coarse level is insufficient to represent the global structure. In this paper, we introduce Log-linear Sparse Attention (LLSA), a trainable sparse attention mechanism for extremely long token sequences that reduces both selection and attention costs from quadratic to log-linear complexity by utilizing a hierarchical structure. LLSA performs hierarchical Top-K selection, progressively adopting sparse Top-K selection with the indices found at the previous level, and introduces a Hierarchical KV Enrichment mechanism that preserves global context while using fewer tokens of different granularity during attention computation. To support efficient training, we develop a high-performance GPU implementation that uses only sparse indices for both the forward and backward passes, eliminating the need for dense attention masks. We evaluate LLSA on high-resolution pixel-space image generation without using patchification and VAE encoding. LLSA accelerates attention inference by 28.27x and DiT training by 6.09x on 256x256 pixel token sequences, while maintaining generation quality. The results demonstrate that LLSA offers a promising direction for training long-sequence DiTs efficiently. Code is available at: https://github.com/SingleZombie/LLSA

Abstract: Computer vision is a rapidly evolving field, giving rise to powerful new tools and techniques in digital forensic investigation, and shows great promise for novel digital forensic applications. One such application, indoor multimedia geolocation, has the potential to become a crucial aid for law enforcement in the fight against human trafficking, child exploitation, and other serious crimes. While outdoor multimedia geolocation has been widely explored, its indoor counterpart remains underdeveloped due to challenges such as similar room layouts, frequent renovations, visual ambiguity, indoor lighting variability, unreliable GPS signals, and limited datasets in sensitive domains. This paper introduces a pipeline that uses electric sockets as consistent indoor markers for geolocation, since plug socket types are standardised by country or region. The three-stage deep learning pipeline detects plug sockets (YOLOv11, mAP@0.5 = 0.843), classifies them into one of 12 plug socket types (Xception, accuracy = 0.912), and maps the detected socket types to countries (accuracy = 0.96 at >90% threshold confidence). To address data scarcity, two dedicated datasets were created: socket detection dataset of 2,328 annotated images expanded to 4,072 through augmentation, and a classification dataset of 3,187 images across 12 plug socket classes. The pipeline was evaluated on the Hotels-50K dataset, focusing on the TraffickCam subset of crowd-sourced hotel images, which capture real-world conditions such as poor lighting and amateur angles. This dataset provides a more realistic evaluation than using professional, well-lit, often wide-angle images from travel websites. This framework demonstrates a practical step toward real-world digital forensic applications. The code, trained models, and the data for this paper are available open source.

Abstract: In-context diffusion models allow users to modify images with remarkable ease and realism. However, the same power raises serious privacy concerns: personal images can be easily manipulated for identity impersonation, misinformation, or other malicious uses, all without the owner's consent. While prior work has explored input perturbations to protect against misuse in personalized text-to-image generation, the robustness of modern, large-scale in-context DiT-based models remains largely unexamined. In this paper, we propose DeContext, a new method to safeguard input images from unauthorized in-context editing. Our key insight is that contextual information from the source image propagates to the output primarily through multimodal attention layers. By injecting small, targeted perturbations that weaken these cross-attention pathways, DeContext breaks this flow, effectively decouples the link between input and output. This simple defense is both efficient and robust. We further show that early denoising steps and specific transformer blocks dominate context propagation, which allows us to concentrate perturbations where they matter most. Experiments on Flux Kontext and Step1X-Edit show that DeContext consistently blocks unwanted image edits while preserving visual quality. These results highlight the effectiveness of attention-based perturbations as a powerful defense against image manipulation.

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery plays a critical role in all-weather, day-and-night remote sensing applications. However, existing SAR-oriented deep learning is constrained by data scarcity, while the physically grounded speckle noise in SAR imagery further hampers fine-grained semantic representation learning. To address these challenges, we propose SARMAE, a Noise-Aware Masked Autoencoder for self-supervised SAR representation learning. Specifically, we construct SAR-1M, the first million-scale SAR dataset, with additional paired optical images, to enable large-scale pre-training. Building upon this, we design Speckle-Aware Representation Enhancement (SARE), which injects SAR-specific speckle noise into masked autoencoders to facilitate noise-aware and robust representation learning. Furthermore, we introduce Semantic Anchor Representation Constraint (SARC), which leverages paired optical priors to align SAR features and ensure semantic consistency. Extensive experiments across multiple SAR datasets demonstrate that SARMAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on classification, detection, and segmentation tasks. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/MiliLab/SARMAE.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models (LDMs) achieve state-of-the-art image synthesis, yet their reconstruction-style denoising objective provides only indirect semantic supervision: high-level semantics emerge slowly, requiring longer training and limiting sample quality. Recent works inject semantics from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) either externally via representation alignment or internally by jointly modeling only a narrow slice of VFM features inside the diffusion process, under-utilizing the rich, nonlinear, multi-layer spatial semantics available. We introduce REGLUE (Representation Entanglement with Global-Local Unified Encoding), a unified latent diffusion framework that jointly models (i) VAE image latents, (ii) compact local (patch-level) VFM semantics, and (iii) a global (image-level) [CLS] token within a single SiT backbone. A lightweight convolutional semantic compressor nonlinearly aggregates multi-layer VFM features into a low-dimensional, spatially structured representation, which is entangled with the VAE latents in the diffusion process. An external alignment loss further regularizes internal representations toward frozen VFM targets. On ImageNet 256x256, REGLUE consistently improves FID and accelerates convergence over SiT-B/2 and SiT-XL/2 baselines, as well as over REPA, ReDi, and REG. Extensive experiments show that (a) spatial VFM semantics are crucial, (b) non-linear compression is key to unlocking their full benefit, and (c) global tokens and external alignment act as complementary, lightweight enhancements within our global-local-latent joint modeling framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的G-buffer条件图像合成方法存在局限：单图像模型缺乏时间一致性，视频模型计算成本高且不适合交互式应用（需要提前获取完整序列）。

Method: 采用双条件架构（ControlNet提供结构指导，ControlLoRA确保时间一致性）和三阶段训练策略，专注于环境特定训练以实现稳定自回归生成。

Conclusion: 通过环境特定训练和自回归框架，FrameDiffuser为交互式应用提供了高效、时间一致的高质量神经渲染解决方案。

Abstract: Neural rendering for interactive applications requires translating geometric and material properties (G-buffer) to photorealistic images with realistic lighting on a frame-by-frame basis. While recent diffusion-based approaches show promise for G-buffer-conditioned image synthesis, they face critical limitations: single-image models like RGBX generate frames independently without temporal consistency, while video models like DiffusionRenderer are too computationally expensive for most consumer gaming sets ups and require complete sequences upfront, making them unsuitable for interactive applications where future frames depend on user input. We introduce FrameDiffuser, an autoregressive neural rendering framework that generates temporally consistent, photorealistic frames by conditioning on G-buffer data and the models own previous output. After an initial frame, FrameDiffuser operates purely on incoming G-buffer data, comprising geometry, materials, and surface properties, while using its previously generated frame for temporal guidance, maintaining stable, temporal consistent generation over hundreds to thousands of frames. Our dual-conditioning architecture combines ControlNet for structural guidance with ControlLoRA for temporal coherence. A three-stage training strategy enables stable autoregressive generation. We specialize our model to individual environments, prioritizing consistency and inference speed over broad generalization, demonstrating that environment-specific training achieves superior photorealistic quality with accurate lighting, shadows, and reflections compared to generalized approaches.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种使用主题指纹识别技术来防止开放数据集中数据泄漏的方法，通过在隐空间中将同一主题的所有图像映射到特定区域，以实现基于相似度匹配的主题重新识别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 结合开放数据集时，同一主题可能出现在多个数据集中，这会导致数据泄漏，从而夸大模型性能。为解决这一问题，需要一种能够识别同一主题跨不同数据集的重复出现，以防止性能评估的偏差。

Method: 利用ResNet-50模型和三元组边界损失进行训练，实现对主题的指纹识别。该方法能在隐空间中将同一主题的所有图像映射到特定区域，并通过相似度匹配进行主题重新识别。研究在3D MRI和2D X射线数据上评估了少样本指纹识别的性能，包括标准(20-way 1-shot)和挑战性(1000-way 1-shot)场景。

Result: 在ChestXray-14数据集上，模型在20-way 1-shot场景下达到99.10%的Mean-Recall-@-K，在500-way 5-shot场景下达到90.06%；在BraTS-2021数据集上，模型在20-way 1-shot场景下达到99.20%，在100-way 3-shot场景下达到98.86%。

Conclusion: 主题指纹识别技术能够有效地识别跨数据集的同一主题，防止数据合并时可能发生的数据泄漏问题。该方法在多项评估指标上表现出色，表明其在医学图像分析和数据集质量控制领域具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Combining open-source datasets can introduce data leakage if the same subject appears in multiple sets, leading to inflated model performance. To address this, we explore subject fingerprinting, mapping all images of a subject to a distinct region in latent space, to enable subject re-identification via similarity matching. Using a ResNet-50 trained with triplet margin loss, we evaluate few-shot fingerprinting on 3D MRI and 2D X-ray data in both standard (20-way 1-shot) and challenging (1000-way 1-shot) scenarios. The model achieves high Mean- Recall-@-K scores: 99.10% (20-way 1-shot) and 90.06% (500-way 5-shot) on ChestXray-14; 99.20% (20-way 1-shot) and 98.86% (100-way 3-shot) on BraTS- 2021.

*Antonella Rech,Nicola Conci,Nicola Garau*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SDFoam：一种结合显式Voronoi图和隐式SDF表达的新颖方法，在保持高效训练的同时显著提升几何重建精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NeRF和3D Gaussian Splatting等方法在网格重建精度方面存在不足，RadiantFoam虽提高效率但几何质量仍有局限。本研究旨在通过隐式SDF引入度量一致等值面来解决几何重建精度问题。

Method: 联合学习显式Voronoi图示和隐式SDF通过光线追踪优化。SDF引入度量一致性等值面，使近表面Voronoi单元面对齐零水平集。使用Eikonal正则化约束几何表达。

Result: SDFoam在保持与RadiantFoam相当的训练速度前提下，在多种场景下大幅提升网格重建精度，显著减少浮动物体和拓扑错误，同时保持相同的光度指标。

Conclusion: 隐式-显式混合表示SDFoam成功克服现有方法几何重建精度局限，实现高质量网格重建且不牺牲效率，为神经渲染和几何重建开辟新方向。

Abstract: Neural radiance fields (NeRF) have driven impressive progress in view synthesis by using ray-traced volumetric rendering. Splatting-based methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) provide faster rendering by rasterizing 3D primitives. RadiantFoam (RF) brought ray tracing back, achieving throughput comparable to Gaussian Splatting by organizing radiance with an explicit Voronoi Diagram (VD). Yet, all the mentioned methods still struggle with precise mesh reconstruction. We address this gap by jointly learning an explicit VD with an implicit Signed Distance Field (SDF). The scene is optimized via ray tracing and regularized by an Eikonal objective. The SDF introduces metric-consistent isosurfaces, which, in turn, bias near-surface Voronoi cell faces to align with the zero level set. The resulting model produces crisper, view-consistent surfaces with fewer floaters and improved topology, while preserving photometric quality and maintaining training speed on par with RadiantFoam. Across diverse scenes, our hybrid implicit-explicit formulation, which we name SDFoam, substantially improves mesh reconstruction accuracy (Chamfer distance) with comparable appearance (PSNR, SSIM), without sacrificing efficiency.

TL;DR: 该论文提出一个开放、多中心、多设备的胎儿超声影像基准数据集，包含专业解剖标志点标注，用于开发AI辅助的胎儿生长评估方法，通过量化域偏移证明多中心测试的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胎儿生长评估依赖于超声影像中的生物测量，但传统手动标记耗时、操作者依赖性强，且受不同扫描设备和中心间差异影响，导致自动化方法可重复性受限。需要多源标注数据集来推动AI辅助方法的发展。

Method: 建立一个包含4,513张去标识化超声图像的数据集，来自1,904名受试者，涵盖3个临床中心和7种超声设备。提供标准化的训练/测试分割（按受试者不重叠）、评估代码和基线结果，并利用自动生物测量模型量化域偏移。

Result: 通过自动生物测量模型验证，仅在单一中心进行训练和评估会显著高估模型性能（相比多中心测试），凸显了多中心数据对模型泛化的重要性。该数据集首次公开覆盖所有主要胎儿生物测量指标（双顶径、枕额径、腹横径、腹前后径和股骨长度）。

Conclusion: 本研究提供了一个首个公开的多中心、多设备、标注解剖标志点的胎儿超声数据集，为胎儿生物测量的域适应和多中心泛化提供了稳健基准，有助于推动更可靠的跨中心AI辅助胎儿生长评估。

Abstract: Accurate fetal growth assessment from ultrasound (US) relies on precise biometry measured by manually identifying anatomical landmarks in standard planes. Manual landmarking is time-consuming, operator-dependent, and sensitive to variability across scanners and sites, limiting the reproducibility of automated approaches. There is a need for multi-source annotated datasets to develop artificial intelligence-assisted fetal growth assessment methods. To address this bottleneck, we present an open, multi-centre, multi-device benchmark dataset of fetal US images with expert anatomical landmark annotations for clinically used fetal biometric measurements. These measurements include head bi-parietal and occipito-frontal diameters, abdominal transverse and antero-posterior diameters, and femoral length. The dataset contains 4,513 de-identified US images from 1,904 subjects acquired at three clinical sites using seven different US devices. We provide standardised, subject-disjoint train/test splits, evaluation code, and baseline results to enable fair and reproducible comparison of methods. Using an automatic biometry model, we quantify domain shift and demonstrate that training and evaluation confined to a single centre substantially overestimate performance relative to multi-centre testing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available multi-centre, multi-device, landmark-annotated dataset that covers all primary fetal biometry measures, providing a robust benchmark for domain adaptation and multi-centre generalisation in fetal biometry and enabling more reliable AI-assisted fetal growth assessment across centres. All data, annotations, training code, and evaluation pipelines are made publicly available.

TL;DR: OMG-Bench是首个基于骨架的大规模在线微手势识别基准，包含40个精细手势类别的13,948个实例，并提出HMATr框架统一检测与分类，性能超越现有方法7.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线微手势识别对VR/AR交互至关重要，但面临公开数据集稀缺和任务特定算法不足的挑战。微手势的细微运动模式使得构建具有精确骨架和帧级标注的数据集十分困难。

Method: 1) 提出多视角自监督流水线自动生成骨架数据，结合启发式规则和专家细化实现半自动标注；2) 基于此构建OMG-Bench基准；3) 提出HMATr框架：利用分层记忆库存储帧级细节和窗口级语义以保存历史上下文，并采用从记忆库初始化的可学习位置感知查询来隐式编码手势位置和语义。

Result: HMATr在检测率上超越当前最优方法7.6%，为在线微手势识别建立了强大基线。OMG-Bench包含40个精细手势类别、13,948个实例、1,272个序列，具有细微运动、快速动态和连续执行的特点。

Conclusion: OMG-Bench填补了骨架在线微手势识别领域的公共基准空白，所提出的HMATr框架通过分层记忆机制有效处理了微手势的时空特性，显著提升了识别性能。

Abstract: Online micro gesture recognition from hand skeletons is critical for VR/AR interaction but faces challenges due to limited public datasets and task-specific algorithms. Micro gestures involve subtle motion patterns, which make constructing datasets with precise skeletons and frame-level annotations difficult. To this end, we develop a multi-view self-supervised pipeline to automatically generate skeleton data, complemented by heuristic rules and expert refinement for semi-automatic annotation. Based on this pipeline, we introduce OMG-Bench, the first large-scale public benchmark for skeleton-based online micro gesture recognition. It features 40 fine-grained gesture classes with 13,948 instances across 1,272 sequences, characterized by subtle motions, rapid dynamics, and continuous execution. To tackle these challenges, we propose Hierarchical Memory-Augmented Transformer (HMATr), an end-to-end framework that unifies gesture detection and classification by leveraging hierarchical memory banks which store frame-level details and window-level semantics to preserve historical context. In addition, it employs learnable position-aware queries initialized from the memory to implicitly encode gesture positions and semantics. Experiments show that HMATr outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.6\% in detection rate, establishing a strong baseline for online micro gesture recognition.

Abstract: With the rapid progress of controllable generation, training data synthesis has become a promising way to expand labeled datasets and alleviate manual annotation in remote sensing (RS). However, the complexity of semantic mask control and the uncertainty of sampling quality often limit the utility of synthetic data in downstream semantic segmentation tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a task-oriented data synthesis framework (TODSynth), including a Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) with unified triple attention and a plug-and-play sampling strategy guided by task feedback. Built upon the powerful DiT-based generative foundation model, we systematically evaluate different control schemes, showing that a text-image-mask joint attention scheme combined with full fine-tuning of the image and mask branches significantly enhances the effectiveness of RS semantic segmentation data synthesis, particularly in few-shot and complex-scene scenarios. Furthermore, we propose a control-rectify flow matching (CRFM) method, which dynamically adjusts sampling directions guided by semantic loss during the early high-plasticity stage, mitigating the instability of generated images and bridging the gap between synthetic data and downstream segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art controllable generation methods, producing more stable and task-oriented synthetic data for RS semantic segmentation.

Furthermore, we conduct extensive ablation studies to investigate the influence of various latent representations within TreeNet, offering deeper insights into the factors contributing to reconstruction.

Conclusion: Make-It-Poseable通过潜在空间变换方法有效解决了传统角色姿态方法的局限性，提供了一种稳健且可泛化的解决方案

Abstract: Posing 3D characters is a fundamental task in computer graphics and vision. However, existing methods like auto-rigging and pose-conditioned generation often struggle with challenges such as inaccurate skinning weight prediction, topological imperfections, and poor pose conformance, limiting their robustness and generalizability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Make-It-Poseable, a novel feed-forward framework that reformulates character posing as a latent-space transformation problem. Instead of deforming mesh vertices as in traditional pipelines, our method reconstructs the character in new poses by directly manipulating its latent representation. At the core of our method is a latent posing transformer that manipulates shape tokens based on skeletal motion. This process is facilitated by a dense pose representation for precise control. To ensure high-fidelity geometry and accommodate topological changes, we also introduce a latent-space supervision strategy and an adaptive completion module. Our method demonstrates superior performance in posing quality. It also naturally extends to 3D editing applications like part replacement and refinement.

TL;DR: FlowDet首次将现代条件流匹配技术用于目标检测，相比基于扩散的检测方法，通过更简单直接的生成运输路径实现更快的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受DiffusionDet将检测作为边界框空间中的生成性去噪问题的启发，作者希望将此框架推广到更广泛的生成运输问题类别，同时保持无需重新训练即可调整边界框数量和推理步骤的能力。与扩散带来的弯曲随机运输路径相比，FlowDet旨在学习更简单直接的路径。

Method: FlowDet采用条件流匹配技术，重新设计目标检测为生成运输问题。该方法维持了无需重新训练即可调整边界框数量和推理步骤的特点，但通过学习更简单直接的运输路径来替代扩散方法中的复杂路径。

Result: 在多个特征主干和数据集上的广泛实验表明，FlowDet优于基于扩散的检测系统以及非生成性基线。在COCO和LVIS数据集上分别实现了+3.6% AP和+4.2% AP_{rare}的性能提升，特别是在召回率受限的设置下，能够突出生成运输的效果而无需过度的候选区域生成。

Conclusion: FlowDet成功将条件流匹配技术应用于目标检测，通过更优的生成运输路径设计，在保持灵活性的同时显著提升了检测性能，为生成式目标检测方法提供了新的思路。

Abstract: We present FlowDet, the first formulation of object detection using modern Conditional Flow Matching techniques. This work follows from DiffusionDet, which originally framed detection as a generative denoising problem in the bounding box space via diffusion. We revisit and generalise this formulation to a broader class of generative transport problems, while maintaining the ability to vary the number of boxes and inference steps without re-training. In contrast to the curved stochastic transport paths induced by diffusion, FlowDet learns simpler and straighter paths resulting in faster scaling of detection performance as the number of inference steps grows. We find that this reformulation enables us to outperform diffusion based detection systems (as well as non-generative baselines) across a wide range of experiments, including various precision/recall operating points using multiple feature backbones and datasets. In particular, when evaluating under recall-constrained settings, we can highlight the effects of the generative transport without over-compensating with large numbers of proposals. This provides gains of up to +3.6% AP and +4.2% AP$_{rare}$ over DiffusionDet on the COCO and LVIS datasets, respectively.

Abstract: We present Kling-Omni, a generalist generative framework designed to synthesize high-fidelity videos directly from multimodal visual language inputs. Adopting an end-to-end perspective, Kling-Omni bridges the functional separation among diverse video generation, editing, and intelligent reasoning tasks, integrating them into a holistic system. Unlike disjointed pipeline approaches, Kling-Omni supports a diverse range of user inputs, including text instructions, reference images, and video contexts, processing them into a unified multimodal representation to deliver cinematic-quality and highly-intelligent video content creation. To support these capabilities, we constructed a comprehensive data system that serves as the foundation for multimodal video creation. The framework is further empowered by efficient large-scale pre-training strategies and infrastructure optimizations for inference. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Kling-Omni demonstrates exceptional capabilities in in-context generation, reasoning-based editing, and multimodal instruction following. Moving beyond a content creation tool, we believe Kling-Omni is a pivotal advancement toward multimodal world simulators capable of perceiving, reasoning, generating and interacting with the dynamic and complex worlds.

Abstract: Datasets are essential to train and evaluate computer vision models used for traffic analysis and to enhance road safety. Existing real datasets fit real-world scenarios, capturing authentic road object behaviors, however, they typically lack precise ground-truth annotations. In contrast, synthetic datasets play a crucial role, allowing for the annotation of a large number of frames without additional costs or extra time. However, a general drawback of synthetic datasets is the lack of realistic vehicle motion, since trajectories are generated using AI models or rule-based systems. In this work, we introduce R3ST (Realistic 3D Synthetic Trajectories), a synthetic dataset that overcomes this limitation by generating a synthetic 3D environment and integrating real-world trajectories derived from SinD, a bird's-eye-view dataset recorded from drone footage. The proposed dataset closes the gap between synthetic data and realistic trajectories, advancing the research in trajectory forecasting of road vehicles, offering both accurate multimodal ground-truth annotations and authentic human-driven vehicle trajectories.

Result: 大量实验表明KineST在轻量级框架下在精度和时间一致性方面均表现优异。

Conclusion: KineST通过运动学引导的状态空间建模有效解决了AR/VR中全身动作跟踪的精度、连贯性和效率平衡问题。

Abstract: Full-body motion tracking plays an essential role in AR/VR applications, bridging physical and virtual interactions. However, it is challenging to reconstruct realistic and diverse full-body poses based on sparse signals obtained by head-mounted displays, which are the main devices in AR/VR scenarios. Existing methods for pose reconstruction often incur high computational costs or rely on separately modeling spatial and temporal dependencies, making it difficult to balance accuracy, temporal coherence, and efficiency. To address this problem, we propose KineST, a novel kinematics-guided state space model, which effectively extracts spatiotemporal dependencies while integrating local and global pose perception. The innovation comes from two core ideas. Firstly, in order to better capture intricate joint relationships, the scanning strategy within the State Space Duality framework is reformulated into kinematics-guided bidirectional scanning, which embeds kinematic priors. Secondly, a mixed spatiotemporal representation learning approach is employed to tightly couple spatial and temporal contexts, balancing accuracy and smoothness. Additionally, a geometric angular velocity loss is introduced to impose physically meaningful constraints on rotational variations for further improving motion stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KineST has superior performance in both accuracy and temporal consistency within a lightweight framework. Project page: https://kaka-1314.github.io/KineST/

Abstract: Designing controllers that simultaneously achieve strong performance and provable closed-loop stability remains a central challenge in control engineering. This work introduces a diffusion-based generative framework for linear controller synthesis grounded in the Youla-Kucera parameterization, enabling the construction of stabilizing controllers by design. The diffusion model learns a conditional mapping from plant dynamics and desired performance metrics to feasible Youla parameters, guaranteeing internal stability while flexibly accommodating user-specified targets. Trained on synthetically generated stable SISO plants with fixed-order Youla parameters, the proposed approach reliably synthesizes controllers that meet prescribed sensitivity and settling-time specifications on previously unseen systems. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first demonstration that diffusion models can generate stabilizing controllers, combining rigorous control-theoretic guarantees with the versatility of modern generative modeling.

Abstract: Differentially flat models are frequently used to design feedforward controllers for electromechanical systems. However, control performance depends on model accuracy, which makes feedback imperative. This paper presents a control scheme for electromechanical systems in which measuring or estimating the output to be controlled -- typically the position -- is not feasible. It employs an identifiable-model-based controller and predictor, coupled with an iterative loop that updates model parameters using the error between a measurable output and its prediction. Simulations on electromechanical switching devices show effective tracking of the desired position trajectory using only coil current measurements.

Abstract: This paper presents a benchmarking framework to evaluate process control strategies in outdoor microalgae raceway reactors, integrating four key control regulation tasks: pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), culture volume through coordinated harvest-dilution actions, and temperature via a sump-mounted spiral heat exchanger. The benchmark is built upon a high-fidelity, experimentally calibrated dynamic model that captures the strongly coupled thermal, physicochemical, and biological processes governing industrial-scale open raceway ponds. A closed-loop simulation environment is provided, featuring realistic actuator constraints, gas transport delays, stiff integration, and a fully specified scenario based on multi-day outdoor disturbances (irradiance, temperature, wind, and humidity). Four user-replaceable controllers define the manipulation of CO2 injection, air bubbling, harvest/dilution sequencing, and heat-exchanger operation. The platform computes a unified global performance index, in addition to individual metrics for each control problem, combining tracking error, gas and energy usage, and biomass productivity, enabling consistent and quantitative comparison of alternative control strategies. Baseline regulatory architectures (On/Off, PI/PID, and Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC)) are included to illustrate the benchmark use for classical and advanced control methods. By providing an openly specified, reproducible, and computationally tractable benchmark with well-defined function interfaces, this work aims to bridge control methodology and outdoor algal bioprocess engineering, and to support the development of multivariable control strategies for disturbance-rich environmental systems.

Motivation: 现有的基于Transformer的控制方法依赖离线训练，权重固定，无法实时自适应，且缺乏稳定性保证。需要解决随机动态系统中漂移和扩散不确定性的自适应估计问题，同时确保跟踪和参数估计误差的稳定性。

Method: 开发连续LyAT控制器，无需离线预训练即可自适应估计随机动态系统中的漂移和扩散不确定性。关键创新是基于Lyapunov稳定性分析构建解析推导的自适应律，实现实时权重更新。

Result: 通过四旋翼飞行器的实验验证了所提出控制器的性能，实现了跟踪和参数估计误差的概率一致最终有界性。

Conclusion: LyAT控制器成功将Transformer融入自适应控制架构，为随机非线性系统提供了具有稳定性保证的实时自适应控制解决方案，克服了现有方法缺乏自适应能力和稳定性保证的局限性。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel Lyapunov-based Adaptive Transformer (LyAT) controller for stochastic nonlinear systems. While transformers have shown promise in various control applications due to sequential modeling through self-attention mechanisms, they have not been used within adaptive control architectures that provide stability guarantees. Existing transformer-based approaches for control rely on offline training with fixed weights, resulting in open-loop implementations that lack real-time adaptation capabilities and stability assurances. To address these limitations, a continuous LyAT controller is developed that adaptively estimates drift and diffusion uncertainties in stochastic dynamical systems without requiring offline pre-training. A key innovation is the analytically derived adaptation law constructed from a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, which enables real-time weight updates while guaranteeing probabilistic uniform ultimate boundedness of tracking and parameter estimation errors. Experimental validation on a quadrotor demonstrates the performance of the developed controller.

Motivation: 水下光子计数光通信系统中存在信号依赖的泊松散粒噪声和异步多用户干扰，使接收信号处理复杂化，阻碍了有效的信号检测。

Method: 1)先设计独特的帧结构，提出分组的同步算法进行活跃用户识别和传输时延估计（先组级、再用户级，降低复杂度）；2)开发非线性迭代多用户检测算法，为每个用户使用检测窗口逐时隙识别干扰符号并估计MUI，再通过最大后验概率进行信号检测。

Result: 仿真表明该方案能达到比特误码率与传输时延已知、信号检测完美同步的场景相当。

Conclusion: 所提出的同步和多用户检测算法能有效应对水下PhC OWC系统的噪声和干扰，实现了接近理想同步情况的性能。

Abstract: Photon counting (PhC) is an effective detection technology for underwater optical wireless communication (OWC) systems. The presence of signal-dependent Poisson shot noise and asynchronous multi-user interference (MUI) complicates the processing of received data signals, hindering the effective signal detection of PhC OWC systems. This paper proposes a novel iterative signal detection method in grant-free, multi-user, underwater PhC OWC systems with signal-dependent Poisson shot noise. We first introduce a new synchronization algorithm with a unique frame structure design.The algorithm performs active user identification and transmission delay estimation. Specifically, the estimation is performed first on a user group basis and then at the individual user level with reduced complexity and latency.We also develop a nonlinear iterative multi-user detection (MUD) algorithm that utilizes a detection window for each user to identify interfering symbols and estimate MUI on a slot-by-slot basis, followed by maximum \textit{a-posteriori} probability detection of user signals.Simulations demonstrate that our scheme achieves bit error rates comparable to scenarios with transmission delays known and signal detection perfectly synchronized.

Abstract: An open multi-agent system (OMAS) comprises migrating agents which produce a flexible network structure that is naturally switching and size-varying. Meanwhile, agent migrations also make an OMAS more prone to environmental adversities. In this work, we deal with the consensus tracking problem of OMASs suffering these migration-induced adversities, including non-vanishing perturbations in the agent dynamics/state and the repelling antagonistic interactions among agents, over an intermittently disconnected signed digraph. The OMAS is interpreted into a perturbed $M^3D$ system in which unstable subsystems are created when repelling interactions dominate the normal cooperative ones in the OMAS network regardless of its connectivity. To handle the destabilizing effects brought by the repelling interaction as well as the non-vanishing perturbations, we extend the stability theory for $M^3D$ systems and apply it to the OMAS to show that practical consensus tracking can be achieved if the migration-induced switching satisfies the piecewise average dwell time and activation time ratio constraints. Particularly, we indicate that for vanishing perturbations and repelling interactions, asymptotic tracking can be expected under weaker switching constraints.

Abstract: This paper proposes a black-start method for an off-grid wind-to-hydrogen (W2H) system comprising a wind farm based on Doubly-Fed Induction Generators (DFIGs), proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) serving as the black-start power source, and a hydrogen production industry. The PEMFC is installed within the hydrogen industry to facilitate direct access to hydrogen fuel. Based on the microgrid topology and black-start scheme, this study innovatively sizes the rated capacity of the PEMFC through power flow analysis. The capacity must be sufficient to charge passive components such as transmission lines and transformers, provide rotor excitation, and supply wind turbine (WT) and electrolyzer (ELZ) auxiliaries during startup. The proposed system integrates wind-hydrogen coordinated control (WHCC) and hydrogen-storage coordinated control (HSCC). Under maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of the WTs, the ELZ follows power fluctuations to absorb wind output, ensuring stable voltage and frequency. Fixed-frequency control applied to either the DFIG or PEMFC converters enables DFIGs to retain conventional grid-following (GFL) operation, reducing converter development costs. For both control modes, this paper establishes the black-start sequence and formulates a comprehensive coordinated control strategy for the entire system. The entire control system is validated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink. Results confirm that the calculated PEMFC capacity supports reliable black-start, while the black-start control strategy ensures smooth system self-startup. Furthermore, the coordinated control strategy maintains stable frequency and voltage under fluctuating wind power, demonstrating the practicality and robustness of the proposed approach.

Conclusion: 所提出的LQR闭环控制与前置参考力优化方法能有效提高3D打印质量，减少材料浪费并防止打印失败

Abstract: Various defects occur during material extrusion additive manufacturing processes that degrade the quality of the 3D printed parts and lead to significant material waste. This motivates feedback control of the extrusion process to mitigate defects and prevent print failure. We propose a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) for closed-loop control with force feedback to provide accurate width tracking of the extruded filament. Furthermore, we propose preemptive optimization of the reference force given to the LQR that accounts for the performance of the LQR and generates the optimal reference for the closed loop extrusion dynamics and machine constraints. Simulation results demonstrate the improved tracking performance and response time. Experiments on a Fused Filament Fabrication 3D printer showcase a root mean square error improvement of 39.57% compared to tracking the unmodified reference as well as an 83.7% shorter settling time.

Motivation: 现有切换系统理论要求至少有一个模式是收缩的，但实际系统中所有模式都可能不收缩。本文旨在放宽这一限制，研究所有模式都不收缩时如何保证系统稳定性。

Method: 利用半范数和半收缩系统概念，构建状态空间的子空间族，在每个子空间中验证收缩性，通过控制各模式的激活时间实现全状态空间收缩。

Result: 提出了保证所有模式都不收缩时切换系统稳定性的条件，通过数值算例验证了理论结果的有效性。

Conclusion: 即使在所有模式都不收缩的情况下，通过适当选择子空间和控制模式切换时机，仍能保证切换系统的整体收缩稳定性，扩展了现有理论框架。

Abstract: This paper investigates contraction properties of switched dynamical systems for the case that all modes are non-contracting, thereby extending existing results that require at least one mode to be contracting. Leveraging the property that unstable systems may still exhibit stable behavior within certain subspaces, conditions are provided which ensure contracting evolution within a given subspace of the state space of the switched system. These conditions are derived using the concepts of seminorms and semi-contracting systems. Then, by selecting a set of subspaces whose corresponding seminorms form a separating family of the state space, and by verifying whether a given mode is contracting in each subspace, conditions on the activation time of each mode are provided by which contraction on the complete state space is guaranteed. Numerical examples are presented for illustration.

Conclusion: 该工作为分析分段光滑系统的渐近行为（如收敛到平衡点或极限环）提供了收缩分析工具，并讨论了向R^n中更一般相交切换流形的扩展可能性。

Abstract: This paper provides conditions to ensure contractive behavior of Filippov solutions generated by multi-modal piecewise smooth (PWS) systems. These conditions are instrumental in analyzing the asymptotic behavior of PWS systems, such as convergence towards an equilibrium point or a limit cycle. The work is motivated by a known principle for contraction analysis of bimodal PWS systems which ensures that the flow dynamics of each mode and the sliding dynamics on the switching manifold are contracting. This approach is extended first to PWS systems with multiple non-intersecting switching manifolds in Rn, and then to two intersecting switching manifolds in R2. Numerical examples are provided to validate the theoretical findings, along with a discussion on extensions to more general intersecting switching manifolds in Rn.

Abstract: Scheduling and loading of chillers in a multi-chiller plant is considered. A new framework is introduced considering an extended set of independent variables for the optimization problem of energy consumption. In this way the number of decision variables is increased, providing extra degrees of freedom to optimize cooling plant operation. The dynamic effects due to transients arising from switching on and off of units are usually not considered in the literature dealing with Optimal Chiller Loading/Sequencing which is restricted to the static case. In this paper, these effects are treated in a way that results in a manageable optimization problem. A Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation solution is deployed for the problem and the proposed method is compared with a similar but static approach showing the benefits in terms of reduced energy consumption.

Motivation: 当前多冷机冷却系统的单元负荷和单元分配问题主要采用经济模型预测控制，以电力消耗的经济成本作为优化目标，而能量优化方法很少被研究。本文首次对这两种优化目标进行比较，探索在能效和成本之间的权衡。

Method: 研究在采用风冷式水冷机和冷存储系统的冷却工厂中进行，将建立的模型集成到Simscape中，使用非凸混合优化方法分别计算能量和经济目标的优化控制轨迹。通过不同季节和多种场景进行对比分析。

Result: 结果表明优化结果取决于电力季节和可用电价。在高电力季节和代表性电价下，使用经济方法相比能量方法会导致能量消耗增加约2.15%，但同时能实现成本降低约2.94%。

Conclusion: 尽管当前经济方法占主导地位，但研究结果支持考虑能量优化方法。两种方法在能效和成本之间存在权衡，具体选择应基于电力季节和电价结构。

Abstract: Economic model predictive control has been proposed as a means for solving the unit loading and unit allocation problem in multi-chiller cooling plants. The adjective economic stems from the use of financial cost due to electricity consumption in a time horizon, such is the loss function minimized at each sampling period. The energetic approach is rarely encountered. This article presents for the first time a comparison between the energetic optimization objective and the economic one. The comparison is made on a cooling plant using air-cooled water chillers and a cold storage system. Models developed have been integrated into Simscape, and non-convex mixed optimization methods used to achieve optimal control trajectories for both energetic and economic goals considered separately. The results over several scenarios, and in different seasons, support the consideration of the energetic approach despite the current prevalence of the economic one. The results are dependent on the electric season and the available tariffs. In particular, for the high electric season and considering a representative tariff, the results show that an increment of about 2.15% in energy consumption takes place when using the economic approach instead of the energetic one. On the other hand, a reduction in cost of 2.94% is achieved.

Motivation: AI工作负载导致数据中心成为高度动态的电力电子负载，故障时行为和工作负载脉冲可能对弱电网连接点造成压力，需要设计能同时保证IT负载供电连续性和电网稳定性的控制方案。

Method: 采用集中式中压不间断电源控制架构，包含三种运行模式：正常模式调节DC母线并整形电网功率；故障模式实施限流P-Q优先级控制，利用UPS-BESS缓冲并采用速率限制的软恢复；可选模式通过电网功率调制提供下垂快速频率响应。通过基波平均dq仿真（50 MW模块，短路比1.5）评估性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的集中式MV-UPS控制架构能有效应对AI数据中心等动态负载对弱电网的挑战，在保障IT负载连续供电的同时显著改善电网暂态性能，为高功率电力电子负载与弱电网的稳定互联提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: AI workloads are turning large data centers into highly dynamic power-electronic loads; fault-time behavior and workload pulsing can stress weak-grid points of interconnection. This paper proposes a centralized medium-voltage (MV) uninterruptible power supply (UPS) control architecture implemented as three operating modes: Mode 1 regulates a DC stiff bus and shapes normal-operation grid draw, Mode 2 enforces current-limited fault-mode P--Q priority with UPS battery energy storage system (UPS-BESS) buffering and a rate-limited post-fault "soft return," and Mode 3 optionally provides droop-based fast frequency response via grid-draw modulation. Fundamental-frequency averaged dq simulations (50 MW block, short-circuit ratio (SCR) = 1.5, 0.5 p.u. three-phase dip for 150~ms) show zero unserved information-technology (IT) energy (0.00000 MWh vs.0.00208 MWh for a momentary-cessation benchmark), a 0.57 p.u. peak inverter current (vs. 1.02 p.u. for a synchronous-reference-frame phase-locked loop (SRF-PLL) low-voltage ride-through (LVRT) baseline), a nonzero mean fault-window grid draw of 0.20~p.u. (vs.approx 0 for momentary cessation), and an improved settled point-of-common-coupling (PCC) voltage minimum of 0.79 p.u. after one cycle (vs. 0.66 p.u.). A forced-oscillation case study applies a 1 Hz pulsed load (+/- 0.25 p.u.) and shows that the normal-operation shaping filters the oscillation seen by the grid while the UPS-BESS buffers the pulsing component.

Abstract: This paper investigates the differentially private consensus problem for general linear multi-agent systems (MASs) based on output feedback protocols. To protect the output information, which is considered private data and may be at high risk of exposure, Laplace noise is added to the information exchange. The conditions for achieving mean square and almost sure consensus in observer-based MASs are established using the backstepping method and the convergence theory for nonnegative almost supermartingales. It is shown that the separation principle remains valid for the consensus problem of linear MASs with decaying Laplace noise. Furthermore, the convergence rate is provided. Then, a joint design framework is developed for state estimation gain, feedback control gain, and noise to ensure the preservation of ε-differential privacy. The output information of each agent is shown to be protected at every time step. Finally, sufficient conditions are established for simultaneously achieving consensus and preserving differential privacy for linear MASs utilizing both full-order and reduced-order observers. Meanwhile, an ε*-differentially private consensus is achieved to meet the desired privacy level. Two simulation examples are provided to validate the theoretical results.

Abstract: Cooperative perception between vehicles is poised to offer robust and reliable scene understanding. Recently, we are witnessing experimental systems research building testbeds that share raw spatial sensor data for cooperative perception. While there has been a marked improvement in accuracies and is the natural way forward, we take a moment to consider the problems with such an approach for eventual adoption by automakers. In this paper, we first argue that new forms of privacy concerns arise and discourage stakeholders to share raw sensor data. Next, we present SHARP, a research framework to minimize privacy leakage and drive stakeholders towards the ambitious goal of raw data based cooperative perception. Finally, we discuss open questions for networked systems, mobile computing, perception researchers, industry and government in realizing our proposed framework.

Abstract: Agentic systems, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), assist network engineers with network configuration synthesis and network troubleshooting tasks. For network troubleshooting, progress is hindered by the absence of standardized and accessible benchmarks for evaluating LLM agents in dynamic network settings at low operational effort. We present NIKA, the largest public benchmark to date for LLM-driven network incident diagnosis and troubleshooting. NIKA targets both domain experts and especially AI researchers alike, providing zero-effort replay of real-world network scenarios, and establishing well-defined agent-network interfaces for quick agent prototyping. NIKA comprises hundreds of curated network incidents, spanning five network scenarios, from data centers to ISP networks, and covers 54 representative network issues. Lastly, NIKA is modular and extensible by design, offering APIs to facilitate the integration of new network scenarios and failure cases. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLM agents on NIKA and find that while larger models succeed more often in detecting network issues, they still struggle to localize faults and identify root causes. NIKA is open-source and available to the community: https://github.com/sands-lab/nika.

Abstract: Underwater acoustic (UWA) communications are essential for high-speed marine data transmission but remain severely constrained by limited bandwidth, significant propagation loss, and sparse multipath structures. Conventional underwater acoustic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems primarily utilize spatial diversity but suffer from limited array resolution, causing angular ambiguity and insufficient spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs). This paper addresses these limitations through acoustic Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (aRIS) to actively generate orthogonally distinguishable virtual paths, significantly enhancing spatial DoFs and channel capacity. An ocean-specific DoF-channel coupling model is established, explicitly deriving conditions for spatial rank enhancement. Subsequently, the optimal geometric locus, termed the Light-Point, is analytically identified, where deploying a single aRIS maximizes DoFs by introducing two and three additional resolvable paths in deep-sea and shallow-sea environments, respectively. Furthermore, an active simultaneous transmitting and reflecting (ASTAR) aRIS architecture with independent beam control and adaptive beam-tracking mechanism integrating unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs) and acoustic intensity gradient sensing is proposed. Extensive simulations validate the proposed joint aRIS deployment and beamforming framework, demonstrating substantial UWA channel capacity improvements-up to 265% and 170% in shallow-sea and deep-sea scenarios, respectively.

Abstract: Reactive jammers pose a severe security threat to robotic-swarm networks by selectively disrupting inter-agent communications and undermining formation integrity and mission success. Conventional countermeasures such as fixed power control or static channel hopping are largely ineffective against such adaptive adversaries. This paper presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework based on the QMIX algorithm to improve the resilience of swarm communications under reactive jamming. We consider a network of multiple transmitter-receiver pairs sharing channels while a reactive jammer with Markovian threshold dynamics senses aggregate power and reacts accordingly. Each agent jointly selects transmit frequency (channel) and power, and QMIX learns a centralized but factorizable action-value function that enables coordinated yet decentralized execution. We benchmark QMIX against a genie-aided optimal policy in a no-channel-reuse setting, and against local Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and a stateless reactive policy in a more general fading regime with channel reuse enabled. Simulation results show that QMIX rapidly converges to cooperative policies that nearly match the genie-aided bound, while achieving higher throughput and lower jamming incidence than the baselines, thereby demonstrating MARL's effectiveness for securing autonomous swarms in contested environments.

Abstract: We present Anubuddhi, a multi-agent AI system that designs and simulates quantum optics experiments from natural language prompts without requiring specialized programming knowledge. The system composes optical layouts by arranging components from a three-tier toolbox via semantic retrieval, then validates designs through physics simulation with convergent refinement. The architecture combines intent routing, knowledge-augmented generation, and dual-mode validation (QuTiP and FreeSim). We evaluated 13 experiments spanning fundamental optics (Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, Michelson/Mach-Zehnder interferometry, Bell states, delayed-choice quantum eraser), quantum information protocols (BB84 QKD, Franson interferometry, GHZ states, quantum teleportation, hyperentanglement), and advanced technologies (boson sampling, electromagnetically induced transparency, frequency conversion). The system achieves design-simulation alignment scores of 8--9/10, with simulations faithfully modeling intended physics. A critical finding distinguishes structural correctness from quantitative accuracy: high alignment confirms correct physics architecture, while numerical predictions require expert review. Free-form simulation outperformed constrained frameworks for 11/13 experiments, revealing that quantum optics diversity demands flexible mathematical representations. The system democratizes computational experiment design for research and pedagogy, producing strong initial designs users can iteratively refine through conversation.

Result: 模拟显示保持基准谦逊系数（λ>0）的系统能产生更稳定的责任分配，降低过度自信决策风险。该框架在四个应用领域均表现出跨学科有效性。

Conclusion: 比例责任原则通过将谦逊形式化为系统参数，为道德责任提供了数学上可处理的建模方法，可作为复杂系统中的稳定化原则，动态平衡认知信心与情境风险，防止决策过度或不足。

Abstract: Traditional ethical frameworks often struggle to model decision-making under uncertainty, treating it as a simple constraint on action. This paper introduces the Principle of Proportional Duty (PPD), a novel framework that models how ethical responsibility scales with an agent's epistemic state. The framework reveals that moral duty is not lost to uncertainty but transforms: as uncertainty increases, Action Duty (the duty to act decisively) is proportionally converted into Repair Duty (the active duty to verify, inquire, and resolve uncertainty).
  This dynamic is expressed by the equation D_total = K[(1-HI) + HI * g(C_signal)], where Total Duty is a function of Knowledge (K), Humility/Uncertainty (HI), and Contextual Signal Strength (C_signal). Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that systems maintaining a baseline humility coefficient (lambda > 0) produce more stable duty allocations and reduce the risk of overconfident decision-making.
  By formalizing humility as a system parameter, the PPD offers a mathematically tractable approach to moral responsibility that could inform the development of auditable AI decision systems. This paper applies the framework across four domains, clinical ethics, recipient-rights law, economic governance, and artificial intelligence, to demonstrate its cross-disciplinary validity. The findings suggest that proportional duty serves as a stabilizing principle within complex systems, preventing both overreach and omission by dynamically balancing epistemic confidence against contextual risk.

Abstract: We present a framework for generating physically realizable assembly instructions from natural language descriptions. Unlike unconstrained text-to-3D approaches, our method operates within a discrete parts vocabulary, enforcing geometric validity, connection constraints, and buildability ordering. Using LDraw as a text-rich intermediate representation, we demonstrate that large language models can be guided with tools to produce valid step-by-step construction sequences and assembly instructions for brick-based prototypes of more than 3000 assembly parts. We introduce a Python library for programmatic model generation and evaluate buildable outputs on complex satellites, aircraft, and architectural domains. The approach aims for demonstrable scalability, modularity, and fidelity that bridges the gap between semantic design intent and manufacturable output. Physical prototyping follows from natural language specifications. The work proposes a novel elemental lingua franca as a key missing piece from the previous pixel-based diffusion methods or computer-aided design (CAD) models that fail to support complex assembly instructions or component exchange. Across four original designs, this novel "bag of bricks" method thus functions as a physical API: a constrained vocabulary connecting precisely oriented brick locations to a "bag of words" through which arbitrary functional requirements compile into material reality. Given such a consistent and repeatable AI representation opens new design options while guiding natural language implementations in manufacturing and engineering prototyping.

Motivation: 大型语言模型虽具有强大推理能力，但在具身环境中存在'符号接地'问题，特别是在信息不对称分布时，知识丰富的'领导者'因缺乏心理理论而无法有效指导传感器受限的'跟随者'。

Method: 在AI2-THOR环境中提出非对称辅助推理框架来量化特权信息偏见现象，比较'推送式'指令与'拉取式'主动查询协议的效果。

Conclusion: 主动不确定性减少机制是安全人机协作和机器人间协作的前提条件，拉取式通信协议能有效缓解特权信息偏见问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) act as powerful reasoning engines but struggle with "symbol grounding" in embodied environments, particularly when information is asymmetrically distributed. We investigate the Privileged Information Bias (or "Curse of Knowledge"), where a knowledgeable "Leader" agent fails to guide a sensor-limited "Follower" due to a lack of Theory of Mind. To quantify this phenomenon, we propose a novel Asymmetric Assistive Reasoning framework within AI2-THOR. Our experiments reveal a significant "Success Gap": while the Leader successfully perceives the target in 35.0% of episodes, the collaborative team succeeds only 17.0% of the time, implying that nearly 50% of feasible plans fail solely due to communicative grounding errors. We demonstrate that a "Pull-based" protocol (active querying) is significantly more robust than standard "Push-based" instruction, with successful episodes featuring 2x the frequency of clarification requests. This research isolates the mechanism of active uncertainty reduction as a prerequisite for safe human-AI and robot-robot collaboration.

Abstract: AI Epidemiology is a framework for governing and explaining advanced AI systems by applying population-level surveillance methods to AI outputs. The approach mirrors the way in which epidemiologists enable public health interventions through statistical evidence before molecular mechanisms are understood. This bypasses the problem of model complexity which plagues current interpretability methods (such as SHAP and mechanistic interpretability) at the scale of deployed models.
  AI Epidemiology achieves this population-level surveillance by standardising capture of AI-expert interactions into structured assessment fields: risk level, alignment score, and accuracy score. These function as exposure variables which predict output failure through statistical associations, much like cholesterol and blood pressure act as exposure variables predicting cardiac events. Output-failure associations are subsequently validated against expert overrides and real-world outcomes.
  The framework places zero burden on experts and provides automatic audit trails by passively tracking expert convergence and divergence with AI recommendations. Since it analyses outputs rather than internal model computations, it also provides governance continuity when institutions update models and switch vendors. Finally, by providing reliability scores and semantic assessments (e.g. 'this recommendation resembles 500 cases overridden by experts due to guideline violations'), it enables experts and institutions to detect unreliable AI outputs before they cause harm. This democratises AI oversight by enabling domain experts to govern AI systems without requiring machine learning expertise.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed to automate complex workflows in mobile and desktop environments. However, current model-centric agent architectures struggle to self-evolve post-deployment: improving personalization, capability, and efficiency typically requires continuous model retraining/fine-tuning, which incurs prohibitive computational overheads and suffers from an inherent trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency.
  To enable iterative self-evolution without model retraining, we propose MOBIMEM, a memory-centric agent system. MOBIMEM first introduces three specialized memory primitives to decouple agent evolution from model weights: (1) Profile Memory uses a lightweight distance-graph (DisGraph) structure to align with user preferences, resolving the accuracy-latency trade-off in user profile retrieval; (2) Experience Memory employs multi-level templates to instantiate execution logic for new tasks, ensuring capability generalization; and (3) Action Memory records fine-grained interaction sequences, reducing the reliance on expensive model inference. Building upon this memory architecture, MOBIMEM further integrates a suite of OS-inspired services to orchestrate execution: a scheduler that coordinates parallel sub-task execution and memory operations; an agent record-and-replay (AgentRR) mechanism that enables safe and efficient action reuse; and a context-aware exception handling that ensures graceful recovery from user interruptions and runtime errors.
  Evaluation on AndroidWorld and top-50 apps shows that MOBIMEM achieves 83.1% profile alignment with 23.83 ms retrieval time (280x faster than GraphRAG baselines), improves task success rates by up to 50.3%, and reduces end-to-end latency by up to 9x on mobile devices.

Abstract: Circular economy (CE) triage is the assessment of products to determine which sustainable pathway they can follow once they reach the end of their usefulness as they are currently being used. Effective CE triage requires adaptive decisions that balance retained value against the costs and constraints of processing and labour. This paper presents a novel decision-making framework as a simple deterministic solver over a state-augmented Disassembly Sequencing Planning (DSP) graph. By encoding the disassembly history into the state, our framework enforces the Markov property, enabling optimal, recursive evaluation by ensuring each decision only depends on the previous state. The triage decision involves choices between continuing disassembly or committing to a CE option. The model integrates condition-aware utility based on diagnostic health scores and complex operational constraints. We demonstrate the framework's flexibility with a worked example: the hierarchical triage of electric vehicle (EV) batteries, where decisions are driven by the recursive valuation of components. The example illustrates how a unified formalism enables the accommodation of varying mechanical complexity, safety requirements, and economic drivers. This unified formalism therefore provides a tractable and generalisable foundation for optimising CE triage decisions across diverse products and operational contexts.

Motivation: 大语言模型在儿科指导中应用日益增多，但缺乏在真实对抗性压力下的安全性研究，特别是焦虑家长的紧急语言可能绕过模型保护机制导致有害建议

Method: 开发PediatricAnxietyBench开源基准测试，包含300个高质量查询（150个患者来源，150个对抗性），涵盖10个儿科主题。使用多维安全框架评估两种Llama模型（70B和8B），对抗性查询模拟家长压力模式（紧急情况、经济障碍、免责声明挑战等）

Result: 平均安全得分5.50/15（SD=2.41）。70B模型优于8B模型（6.26 vs 4.95，p<0.001），关键故障率更低（4.8% vs 12.0%，p=0.02）。对抗性查询使安全性降低8%（p=0.03），紧急情况导致的下降最大（-1.40）。发作相关查询漏洞最明显（33.3%不恰当诊断），提示性语言与安全得分强相关（r=0.68，p<0.001），紧急识别能力完全缺失

Conclusion: 模型规模影响安全性，但所有模型都对真实的家长压力表现出脆弱性。PediatricAnxietyBench提供了可重复使用的对抗性评估框架，能揭示被标准基准忽略的临床重要故障模式

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly consulted by parents for pediatric guidance, yet their safety under real-world adversarial pressures is poorly understood. Anxious parents often use urgent language that can compromise model safeguards, potentially causing harmful advice. PediatricAnxietyBench is an open-source benchmark of 300 high-quality queries across 10 pediatric topics (150 patient-derived, 150 adversarial) enabling reproducible evaluation. Two Llama models (70B and 8B) were assessed using a multi-dimensional safety framework covering diagnostic restraint, referral adherence, hedging, and emergency recognition. Adversarial queries incorporated parental pressure patterns, including urgency, economic barriers, and challenges to disclaimers. Mean safety score was 5.50/15 (SD=2.41). The 70B model outperformed the 8B model (6.26 vs 4.95, p<0.001) with lower critical failures (4.8% vs 12.0%, p=0.02). Adversarial queries reduced safety by 8% (p=0.03), with urgency causing the largest drop (-1.40). Vulnerabilities appeared in seizures (33.3% inappropriate diagnosis) and post-vaccination queries. Hedging strongly correlated with safety (r=0.68, p<0.001), while emergency recognition was absent. Model scale influences safety, yet all models showed vulnerabilities to realistic parental pressures. PediatricAnxietyBench provides a reusable adversarial evaluation framework to reveal clinically significant failure modes overlooked by standard benchmarks.

Abstract: Many large language models (LLMs) are trained on a massive body of knowledge present on the Internet. Darth Vecdor (DV) was designed to extract this knowledge into a structured, terminology-mapped, SQL database ("knowledge base" or "knowledge graph"). Knowledge graphs may be useful in many domains, including healthcare. Although one might query an LLM directly rather than a SQL-based knowledge graph, concerns such as cost, speed, safety, and confidence may arise, especially in high-volume operations. These may be mitigated when the information is pre-extracted from the LLM and becomes query-able through a standard database. However, the author found the need to address several issues. These included erroneous, off-topic, free-text, overly general, and inconsistent LLM responses, as well as allowing for multi-element responses. DV was built with features intended to mitigate these issues. To facilitate ease of use, and to allow for prompt engineering by those with domain expertise but little technical background, DV provides a simple, browser-based graphical user interface. DV has been released as free, open-source, extensible software, on an "as is" basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied. Users need to be cognizant of the potential risks and benefits of using DV and its outputs, and users are responsible for ensuring any use is safe and effective. DV should be assumed to have bugs, potentially very serious ones. However, the author hopes that appropriate use of current and future versions of DV and its outputs can help improve healthcare.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Despite initial successes and a variety of architectures, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems still struggle to reliably retrieve and connect the multi-step evidence required for complicated reasoning tasks. Most of the standard RAG frameworks regard all retrieved information as equally reliable, overlooking the varying credibility and interconnected nature of large textual corpora. GraphRAG approaches offer potential improvement to RAG systems by integrating knowledge graphs, which structure information into nodes and edges, capture entity relationships, and enable multi-step logical traversal. However, GraphRAG is not always an ideal solution as it depends on high-quality graph representations of the corpus, which requires either pre-existing knowledge graphs that are expensive to build and update, or automated graph construction pipelines that are often unreliable. Moreover, systems following this paradigm typically use large language models to guide graph traversal and evidence retrieval, leading to challenges similar to those encountered with standard RAG. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG framework that employs the spreading activation algorithm to retrieve information from a corpus of documents interconnected by automatically constructed knowledge graphs, thereby enhancing the performance of large language models on complex tasks such as multi-hop question answering. Experiments show that our method achieves better or comparable performance to iterative RAG methodologies, while also being easily integrable as a plug-and-play module with a wide range of RAG-based approaches. Combining our method with chain-of-thought iterative retrieval yields up to a 39\% absolute gain in answer correctness compared to naive RAG, achieving these results with small open-weight language models and highlighting its effectiveness in resource-constrained settings.

Abstract: As organizations scale adoption of generative AI, model cost optimization and operational efficiency have emerged as critical factors determining sustainability and accessibility. While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities across diverse tasks, their extensive computational requirements make them cost-prohibitive for routine enterprise use. This limitation motivates the exploration of Small Language Models (SLMs), which can deliver comparable performance in targeted applications while drastically reducing infrastructure overhead (Irugalbandara et al., 2023). In this work, we investigate the feasibility of replacing LLM-driven workflows with optimized SLMs. We trained a domain-adapted SLM to execute representative tasks traditionally handled by LLMs, such as document summarization, query answering, and structured data interpretation. As part of the experiment, we investigated the fine-tuning of facebook/opt-350m model (single epoch only) using the Hugging Face TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning), specifically the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) trainer. The OPT-350M model was released by Meta AI in 2022 as part of the OPT (Open Pretrained Transformer) family of models. Similar studies demonstrate that even models at the 350M parameter scale can meaningfully contribute to instruction-tuning pipelines (Mekala et al., 2024). Experimental results demonstrated that our fine-tuned SLM achieves exceptional performance with a 77.55\% pass rate on ToolBench evaluation, significantly outperforming all baseline models including ChatGPT-CoT (26.00\%), ToolLLaMA-DFS (30.18\%), and ToolLLaMA-CoT (16.27\%). These findings emphasize that thoughtful design and targeted training of SLMs can significantly lower barriers to adoption, enabling cost-effective, large-scale integration of generative AI into production systems.

Abstract: Where do objective functions come from? How do we select what goals to pursue? Human intelligence is adept at synthesizing new objective functions on the fly. How does this work, and can we endow artificial systems with the same ability? This paper proposes an approach to answering these questions, starting with the concept of a subjective function, a higher-order objective function that is endogenous to the agent (i.e., defined with respect to the agent's features, rather than an external task). Expected prediction error is studied as a concrete example of a subjective function. This proposal has many connections to ideas in psychology, neuroscience, and machine learning.

Abstract: The proliferation of time series foundation models has created a landscape where no single method achieves consistent superiority, framing the central challenge not as finding the best model, but as orchestrating an optimal ensemble with interpretability. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer powerful reasoning capabilities, their direct application to time series forecasting has proven ineffective. We address this gap by repositioning the LLM as an intelligent judge that evaluates, explains, and strategically coordinates an ensemble of foundation models. To overcome the LLM's inherent lack of domain-specific knowledge on time series, we introduce an R1-style finetuning process, guided by SHAP-based faithfulness scores, which teaches the model to interpret ensemble weights as meaningful causal statements about temporal dynamics. The trained agent then engages in iterative, multi-turn conversations to perform forward-looking assessments, provide causally-grounded explanations for its weighting decisions, and adaptively refine the optimization strategy. Validated on the GIFT-Eval benchmark on 23 datasets across 97 settings, our approach significantly outperforms leading time series foundation models on both CRPS and MASE metrics, establishing new state-of-the-art results.

Method: 构建KalshiBench基准，包含300个来自受监管交易所的预测市场问题，确保事件结果发生在模型训练截止时间之后，以评估模型对真正未知事件的校准能力。

Result: 所有测试模型都表现出系统性过度自信，最佳校准模型Claude Opus 4.5也有显著校准误差(ECE=0.120)，而带有增强推理能力的模型如GPT-5.2-XHigh校准更差(ECE=0.395)。仅有一个模型获得正Brier技能评分。

Conclusion: 模型规模和增强推理能力并不能自动带来校准优势，认识论校准是需要针对性开发的独特能力。

Abstract: A well-calibrated model should express confidence that matches its actual accuracy -- when it claims 80\% confidence, it should be correct 80\% of the time. While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across diverse tasks, their epistemic calibration remains poorly understood. We introduce \textbf{KalshiBench}, a benchmark of 300 prediction market questions from Kalshi, a CFTC-regulated exchange, with verifiable real-world outcomes occurring after model training cutoffs. Unlike traditional benchmarks measuring accuracy on static knowledge, KalshiBench evaluates whether models can appropriately quantify uncertainty about genuinely unknown future events. We evaluate five frontier models -- Claude Opus 4.5, GPT-5.2, DeepSeek-V3.2, Qwen3-235B, and Kimi-K2 -- and find \textbf{systematic overconfidence across all models}. Even the best-calibrated model (Claude Opus 4.5, ECE=0.120) shows substantial calibration errors, while reasoning-enhanced models like GPT-5.2-XHigh exhibit \emph{worse} calibration (ECE=0.395) despite comparable accuracy. Critically, only one model achieves a positive Brier Skill Score, indicating most models perform worse than simply predicting base rates. Our findings suggest that scaling and enhanced reasoning do not automatically confer calibration benefits, highlighting epistemic calibration as a distinct capability requiring targeted development.

Abstract: As generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) becomes increasingly capable of delivering personalized learning experiences and real-time feedback, a growing number of students are incorporating these tools into their academic workflows. They use GenAI to clarify concepts, solve complex problems, and, in some cases, complete assignments by copying and pasting model-generated contents. While GenAI has the potential to enhance learning experience, it also raises concerns around misinformation, hallucinated outputs, and its potential to undermine critical thinking and problem-solving skills. In response, many universities, colleges, departments, and instructors have begun to develop and adopt policies to guide responsible integration of GenAI into learning environments. However, these policies vary widely across institutions and contexts, and their evolving nature often leaves students uncertain about expectations and best practices. To address this challenge, the authors designed and implemented an automated system for discovering and categorizing AI-related policies found in course syllabi and institutional policy websites. The system combines unsupervised topic modeling techniques to identify key policy themes with large language models (LLMs) to classify the level of GenAI allowance and other requirements in policy texts. The developed application achieved a coherence score of 0.73 for topic discovery. In addition, GPT-4.0-based classification of policy categories achieved precision between 0.92 and 0.97, and recall between 0.85 and 0.97 across eight identified topics. By providing structured and interpretable policy information, this tool promotes the safe, equitable, and pedagogically aligned use of GenAI technologies in education. Furthermore, the system can be integrated into educational technology platforms to help students understand and comply with relevant guidelines.

Abstract: Training LLMs to invoke tools and leverage retrieved information necessitates high-quality, diverse data. However, existing pipelines for synthetic data generation often rely on tens of thousands of real API calls to enhance generalization, incurring prohibitive costs while lacking multi-hop reasoning and self-reflection. To address these limitations, we introduce ToolForge, an automated synthesis framework that achieves strong real-world tool-calling performance by constructing only a small number of virtual tools, eliminating the need for real API calls. ToolForge leverages a (question, golden context, answer) triple to synthesize large-scale tool-learning data specifically designed for multi-hop search scenarios, further enriching the generated data through multi-hop reasoning and self-reflection mechanisms. To ensure data fidelity, we employ a Multi-Layer Validation Framework that integrates both rule-based and model-based assessments. Empirical results show that a model with only 8B parameters, when trained on our synthesized data, outperforms GPT-4o on multiple benchmarks. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/Buycar-arb/ToolForge .

Abstract: Solving Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) is a cornerstone of engineering and scientific research. Traditional methods for PDE solving are cumbersome, relying on manual setup and domain expertise. While Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINNs) introduced end-to-end neural network-based solutions, and frameworks like DeepXDE further enhanced automation, these approaches still depend on expert knowledge and lack full autonomy. In this work, we frame PDE solving as tool invocation via LLM-driven agents and introduce PDE-Agent, the first toolchain-augmented multi-agent collaboration framework, inheriting the reasoning capacity of LLMs and the controllability of external tools and enabling automated PDE solving from natural language descriptions. PDE-Agent leverages the strengths of multi-agent and multi-tool collaboration through two key innovations: (1) A Prog-Act framework with graph memory for multi-agent collaboration, which enables effective dynamic planning and error correction via dual-loop mechanisms (localized fixes and global revisions). (2) A Resource-Pool integrated with a tool-parameter separation mechanism for multi-tool collaboration. This centralizes the management of runtime artifacts and resolves inter-tool dependency gaps in existing frameworks. To validate and evaluate this new paradigm for PDE solving , we develop PDE-Bench, a multi-type PDE Benchmark for agent-based tool collaborative solving, and propose multi-level metrics for assessing tool coordination. Evaluations verify that PDE-Agent exhibits superior applicability and performance in complex multi-step, cross-step dependent tasks. This new paradigm of toolchain-augmented multi-agent PDE solving will further advance future developments in automated scientific computing. Our source code and dataset will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: SPRITE框架通过模拟器和大型模型程序化合成大规模、多样且高质量的空间推理数据，解决了现有方法在可扩展性、多样性和计算精度上的矛盾。

Motivation: 现有提升视觉语言模型空间理解能力的方法面临两难：模板化数据集可扩展但结构僵化，人工标注语言多样但不可扩展且计算不精确。需要突破这一困境。

Method: 将真实标签生成重构为代码生成任务，利用LLMs将复杂空间问题编译为可执行程序，并通过从模拟器中提取的高精度场景元信息进行验证，确保计算精度和可验证性。

Result: 构建的数据集包含3个模拟器、1.1万+场景、30万+图像/视频指令调优对，训练出的VLM在多个空间基准测试中表现显著提升，性能优于同等规模的其他开源数据集。

Conclusion: 克服传统模板方法的低多样性本质对于构建鲁棒、可泛化的空间智能至关重要，SPRITE框架代码和完整数据集将开源以促进空间智能研究。

Abstract: Embodied intelligence, a grand challenge in artificial intelligence, is fundamentally constrained by the limited spatial understanding and reasoning capabilities of current models. Prevailing efforts to address this through enhancing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are trapped in a dilemma: template-based datasets are scalable but structurally rigid, while manual annotation is linguistically diverse but unscalable and, critically, computationally imprecise. We introduce SPRITE, a novel framework that overcomes this dilemma by leveraging simulators and large models to programmatically synthesize scalable, diverse, and high-quality spatial reasoning data. The core innovation of SPRITE is to reframe ground-truth generation as a code-generation task. We utilize LLMs to compile complex spatial questions into executable programs, which are then verified against high-precision scene meta-information extracted from simulators. This ensures our ground truth is both computationally precise and verifiable, while the generative power of LLMs provides vast linguistic diversity. Leveraging this pipeline, we have curated a dataset encompassing 3 simulators, 11k+ scenes, and 300k+ image/video instruction-tuning pairs. We demonstrate that a VLM trained on our data achieves significant performance gains on multiple spatial benchmarks and outperforms other open-source datasets of equivalent size. Furthermore, a scalability analysis confirms our hypothesis that overcoming the low-diversity nature of traditional template methods is essential for building robust, generalizable spatial intelligence. We will make the SPRITE framework code and the full 300k+ dataset publicly available to facilitate future research in spatial intelligence.

TL;DR: AlignMerge是一个几何感知的大语言模型融合框架，通过在Fisher几何中显式保持对齐不变性来避免融合过程中的安全性破坏。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型融合方法（如权重平均、Fisher加权等）在保持损失函数的同时会悄悄破坏模型的对齐性，需要一种能显式保护对齐的融合方法。

Method: 在指令调优基础上构建局部Fisher图表，估计对齐子空间并用投影器P_A约束。优化目标包含几何损失L_geo（保持在Fisher-Rao几何中）、对齐损失L_align（惩罚对齐敏感方向移动）和预算损失L_bud（软对齐预算）。使用解码不变的对齐质量指数（AQI）作为对齐函数。

Result: 在五个模型系列（LLaMA-3 8B、Mistral 7B、Qwen 2、Phi-3.5、Gemma 2）上测试，AlignMerge在提升对齐指标（AQI、毒性、LLM-judge对齐）的同时，在指令遵循、推理和帮助性方面匹配或超过最佳专家模型。与Fisher soups、TIES、SafeMerge等方法相比，对齐子空间漂移更小，预算违规更少。

Conclusion: 这项工作将对齐保护提升为模型融合的首要设计目标，为未来基础模型的几何感知组合提供了路径。融合不应是数值技巧，而是围绕已对齐基点的几何约束操作。

Abstract: Merging large language models (LLMs) is a practical way to compose capabilities from multiple fine-tuned checkpoints without retraining. Yet standard schemes (linear weight soups, task vectors, and Fisher-weighted averaging) can preserve loss while quietly destroying alignment. We argue that merging is not a numerical trick but a geometry-constrained operation around an already-aligned anchor: fusion must be steered to respect safety geometry, not validated post hoc.
  We introduce AlignMerge, a geometry-aware merging framework that makes alignment an explicit invariant. In a local Fisher chart around an instruction-tuned base, we estimate an alignment subspace with projector P_A and optimize:
  L_AlignMerge = L_geo + lambda_align * L_align + lambda_bud * L_bud,
  where L_geo keeps the merge close to its experts in Fisher-Rao geometry, L_align penalizes motion along alignment-sensitive directions, and L_bud enforces a soft alignment budget. As the alignment functional we use the decoding-invariant Alignment Quality Index (AQI), a latent-space criterion that captures how cleanly aligned and misaligned behaviors separate in representation space.
  Across five model families (LLaMA-3 8B, Mistral 7B, Qwen 2, Phi-3.5, Gemma 2), merging safety anchors with task experts, AlignMerge improves alignment metrics (AQI, toxicity, LLM-judge alignment) while matching or exceeding the best expert on instruction-following, reasoning, and helpfulness. It also exhibits smaller alignment-subspace drift and fewer budget violations than Fisher soups, TIES, SafeMerge, and MergeAlign. These results make alignment-preserving merging a first-class design goal and suggest a path to geometry-aware composition of future foundation models.

Abstract: Recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) such as GPT-4o and Qwen3-Omni show strong perception but struggle in multi-speaker, dialogue-centric settings that demand agentic reasoning tracking who speaks, maintaining roles, and grounding events across time. These scenarios are central to multimodal audio-video understanding, where models must jointly reason over audio and visual streams in applications such as conversational video assistants and meeting analytics. We introduce AMUSE, a benchmark designed around tasks that are inherently agentic, requiring models to decompose complex audio-visual interactions into planning, grounding, and reflection steps. It evaluates MLLMs across three modes zero-shot, guided, and agentic and six task families, including spatio-temporal speaker grounding and multimodal dialogue summarization. Across all modes, current models exhibit weak multi-speaker reasoning and inconsistent behavior under both non-agentic and agentic evaluation. Motivated by the inherently agentic nature of these tasks and recent advances in LLM agents, we propose RAFT, a data-efficient agentic alignment framework that integrates reward optimization with intrinsic multimodal self-evaluation as reward and selective parameter adaptation for data and parameter efficient updates. Using RAFT, we achieve up to 39.52\% relative improvement in accuracy on our benchmark. Together, AMUSE and RAFT provide a practical platform for examining agentic reasoning in multimodal models and improving their capabilities.

Abstract: Real-world agentic tasks, unlike synchronous Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), often involve non-blocking actions with variable latencies, creating a fundamental \textit{Temporal Gap} between action initiation and completion. Existing environment-side solutions, such as blocking wrappers or frequent polling, either limit scalability or dilute the agent's context window with redundant observations. In this work, we propose an \textbf{Agent-side Approach} that empowers Large Language Models (LLMs) to actively align their \textit{Cognitive Timeline} with the physical world. By extending the Code-as-Action paradigm to the temporal domain, agents utilize semantic priors and In-Context Learning (ICL) to predict precise waiting durations (\texttt{time.sleep(t)}), effectively synchronizing with asynchronous environment without exhaustive checking. Experiments in a simulated Kubernetes cluster demonstrate that agents can precisely calibrate their internal clocks to minimize both query overhead and execution latency, validating that temporal awareness is a learnable capability essential for autonomous evolution in open-ended environments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Safety risks arise as large language model-based agents solve complex tasks with tools, multi-step plans, and inter-agent messages. However, deployer-written policies in natural language are ambiguous and context dependent, so they map poorly to machine-checkable rules, and runtime enforcement is unreliable. Expressing safety policies as sequents, we propose \textsc{QuadSentinel}, a four-agent guard (state tracker, policy verifier, threat watcher, and referee) that compiles these policies into machine-checkable rules built from predicates over observable state and enforces them online. Referee logic plus an efficient top-$k$ predicate updater keeps costs low by prioritizing checks and resolving conflicts hierarchically. Measured on ST-WebAgentBench (ICML CUA~'25) and AgentHarm (ICLR~'25), \textsc{QuadSentinel} improves guardrail accuracy and rule recall while reducing false positives. Against single-agent baselines such as ShieldAgent (ICML~'25), it yields better overall safety control. Near-term deployments can adopt this pattern without modifying core agents by keeping policies separate and machine-checkable. Our code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/yyiliu/QuadSentinel.

Abstract: Cutting-edge agentic AI systems are built on foundation models that can be adapted to plan, reason, and interact with external tools to perform increasingly complex and specialized tasks. As these systems grow in capability and scope, adaptation becomes a central mechanism for improving performance, reliability, and generalization. In this paper, we unify the rapidly expanding research landscape into a systematic framework that spans both agent adaptations and tool adaptations. We further decompose these into tool-execution-signaled and agent-output-signaled forms of agent adaptation, as well as agent-agnostic and agent-supervised forms of tool adaptation. We demonstrate that this framework helps clarify the design space of adaptation strategies in agentic AI, makes their trade-offs explicit, and provides practical guidance for selecting or switching among strategies during system design. We then review the representative approaches in each category, analyze their strengths and limitations, and highlight key open challenges and future opportunities. Overall, this paper aims to offer a conceptual foundation and practical roadmap for researchers and practitioners seeking to build more capable, efficient, and reliable agentic AI systems.

Abstract: Decentralized large language model (LLM) inference promises transparent and censorship resistant access to advanced AI, yet existing verification approaches struggle to scale to modern models. Proof of Quality (PoQ) replaces cryptographic verification of computation with consensus over output quality, but the original formulation ignores heterogeneous computational costs across inference and evaluator nodes. This paper introduces a cost-aware PoQ framework that integrates explicit efficiency measurements into the reward mechanism for both types of nodes. The design combines ground truth token level F1, lightweight learned evaluators, and GPT based judgments within a unified evaluation pipeline, and adopts a linear reward function that balances normalized quality and cost.
  Experiments on extractive question answering and abstractive summarization use five instruction tuned LLMs ranging from TinyLlama-1.1B to Llama-3.2-3B and three evaluation models spanning cross encoder and bi encoder architectures. Results show that a semantic textual similarity bi encoder achieves much higher correlation with both ground truth and GPT scores than cross encoders, indicating that evaluator architecture is a critical design choice for PoQ. Quality-cost analysis further reveals that the largest models in the pool are also the most efficient in terms of quality per unit latency. Monte Carlo simulations over 5\,000 PoQ rounds demonstrate that the cost-aware reward scheme consistently assigns higher average rewards to high quality low cost inference models and to efficient evaluators, while penalizing slow low quality nodes. These findings suggest that cost-aware PoQ provides a practical foundation for economically sustainable decentralized LLM inference.

Motivation: 受人类构建和使用路径方式启发，开发新的元启发式优化算法。人类在路径选择中表现出的智能行为（如偏好流行路线、路径封闭时混合现有路径、随机探索新路径）可为优化算法设计提供新思路。

Method: 仿照人类构建和使用路径的行为设计元启发式优化算法。算法基于以下原理：人类偏好热门交通路线；当路径封闭时，人类会智能混合现有路径构建新路线；人类会随机选择不同路径探索未知目的地。算法生成随机种群（类似群体智能算法），每个粒子代表一条通往目标地点的路径。

Conclusion: 提出的路径构建模仿算法（PCIA）是一种有效的元启发式优化方法，在多种优化问题上表现出与现有先进算法相当的竞争力。

Abstract: In this paper, a new metaheuristic optimization algorithm, called Path Construction Imitation Algorithm (PCIA), is proposed. PCIA is inspired by how humans construct new paths and use them. Typically, humans prefer popular transportation routes. In the event of a path closure, a new route is built by mixing the existing paths intelligently. Also, humans select different pathways on a random basis to reach unknown destinations. PCIA generates a random population to find the best route toward the destination, similar to swarm-based algorithms. Each particle represents a path toward the destination. PCIA has been tested with 53 mathematical optimization problems and 13 constrained optimization problems. The results showed that the PCIA is highly competitive compared to both popular and the latest metaheuristic algorithms.

Abstract: Computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) has long been envisioned as a complementary tool for synthetic chemists. However, existing frameworks often lack mechanisms to allow interaction with human experts, limiting their ability to integrate chemists' insights. In this work, we introduce Synthelite, a synthesis planning framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to directly propose retrosynthetic transformations. Synthelite can generate end-to-end synthesis routes by harnessing the intrinsic chemical knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, while allowing expert intervention through natural language prompts. Our experiments demonstrate that Synthelite can flexibly adapt its planning trajectory to diverse user-specified constraints, achieving up to 95\% success rates in both strategy-constrained and starting-material-constrained synthesis tasks. Additionally, Synthelite exhibits the ability to account for chemical feasibility during route design. We envision Synthelite to be both a useful tool and a step toward a paradigm where LLMs are the central orchestrators of synthesis planning.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for interpreting multivariate time-series data, yet their application to real-world battery energy storage system (BESS) operation and maintenance remains largely unexplored. Here, we present TimeSeries2Report (TS2R), a prompting framework that converts raw lithium-ion battery operational time-series into structured, semantically enriched reports, enabling LLMs to reason, predict, and make decisions in BESS management scenarios. TS2R encodes short-term temporal dynamics into natural language through a combination of segmentation, semantic abstraction, and rule-based interpretation, effectively bridging low-level sensor signals with high-level contextual insights. We benchmark TS2R across both lab-scale and real-world datasets, evaluating report quality and downstream task performance in anomaly detection, state-of-charge prediction, and charging/discharging management. Compared with vision-, embedding-, and text-based prompting baselines, report-based prompting via TS2R consistently improves LLM performance in terms of across accuracy, robustness, and explainability metrics. Notably, TS2R-integrated LLMs achieve expert-level decision quality and predictive consistency without retraining or architecture modification, establishing a practical path for adaptive, LLM-driven battery intelligence.

Motivation: 当前自动驾驶安全评估中，虚拟测试虽能生成高视觉保真度的合成数据，但像素级保真度并不能保证系统决策在真实世界和仿真环境中依赖相同的因果特征。现有方法缺乏基于系统行为的保真度度量标准。

Result: 在2126个匹配的KITTI-VirtualKITTI2数据对上的实验表明，DFF能发现传统输出值保真度忽略的差异；DFF引导的校准能在不损害输出值保真度的前提下，提高关键特征和输入级保真度。

Conclusion: DFF为自动驾驶系统测试提供了一种行为基础的保真度度量，强调了确保系统决策依赖相同因果特征的重要性，DFF引导的校准能有效提升仿真数据的实用价值。

Abstract: Virtual testing using synthetic data has become a cornerstone of autonomous vehicle (AV) safety assurance. Despite progress in improving visual realism through advanced simulators and generative AI, recent studies reveal that pixel-level fidelity alone does not ensure reliable transfer from simulation to the real world. What truly matters is whether the system-under-test (SUT) bases its decisions on the same causal evidence in both real and simulated environments - not just whether images "look real" to humans. This paper addresses the lack of such a behavior-grounded fidelity measure by introducing Decisive Feature Fidelity (DFF), a new SUT-specific metric that extends the existing fidelity spectrum to capture mechanism parity - the agreement in causal evidence underlying the SUT's decisions across domains. DFF leverages explainable-AI (XAI) methods to identify and compare the decisive features driving the SUT's outputs for matched real-synthetic pairs. We further propose practical estimators based on counterfactual explanations, along with a DFF-guided calibration scheme to enhance simulator fidelity. Experiments on 2126 matched KITTI-VirtualKITTI2 pairs demonstrate that DFF reveals discrepancies overlooked by conventional output-value fidelity. Furthermore, results show that DFF-guided calibration improves decisive-feature and input-level fidelity without sacrificing output value fidelity across diverse SUTs.

Abstract: Empirical research on meta-algorithmics, such as algorithm selection, configuration, and scheduling, often relies on extensive and thus computationally expensive experiments. With the large degree of freedom we have over our experimental setup and design comes a plethora of possible error sources that threaten the scalability and validity of our scientific insights. Best practices for meta-algorithmic research exist, but they are scattered between different publications and fields, and continue to evolve separately from each other. In this report, we collect good practices for empirical meta-algorithmic research across the subfields of the COSEAL community, encompassing the entire experimental cycle: from formulating research questions and selecting an experimental design, to executing ex- periments, and ultimately, analyzing and presenting results impartially. It establishes the current state-of-the-art practices within meta-algorithmic research and serves as a guideline to both new researchers and practitioners in meta-algorithmic fields.

Abstract: Generative art systems often involve high-dimensional and complex parameter spaces in which aesthetically compelling outputs occupy only small, fragmented regions. Because of this combinatorial explosion, artists typically rely on extensive manual trial-and-error, leaving many potentially interesting configurations undiscovered. In this work we make two contributions. First, we introduce ParamExplorer, an interactive and modular framework inspired by reinforcement learning that helps the exploration of parameter spaces in generative art algorithms, guided by human-in-the-loop or even automated feedback. The framework also integrates seamlessly with existing p5.js projects. Second, within this framework we implement and evaluate several exploration strategies, referred to as agents.

Abstract: Deploying local large language models and vision-language models on edge devices requires balancing accuracy with constrained computational and energy budgets. Although graphics processors dominate modern artificial-intelligence deployment, most consumer hardware--including laptops, desktops, industrial controllers, and embedded systems--relies on central processing units. Despite this, the computational laws governing central-processing-unit-only inference for local language and vision-language workloads remain largely unexplored. We systematically benchmark large language and vision-language models on two representative central-processing-unit tiers widely used for local inference: a MacBook Pro M2, reflecting mainstream laptop-class deployment, and a Raspberry Pi 5, representing constrained, low-power embedded settings. Using a unified methodology based on continuous sampling of processor and memory usage together with area-under-curve integration, we characterize how computational load scales with input text length for language models and with image resolution for vision-language models. We uncover two empirical scaling laws: (1) computational cost for language-model inference scales approximately linearly with token length; and (2) vision-language models exhibit a preprocessing-driven "resolution knee", where compute remains constant above an internal resolution clamp and decreases sharply below it. Beyond these laws, we show that quantum-inspired compression reduces processor and memory usage by up to 71.9% and energy consumption by up to 62%, while preserving or improving semantic accuracy. These results provide a systematic quantification of multimodal central-processing-unit-only scaling for local language and vision-language workloads, and they identify model compression and input-resolution preprocessing as effective, low-cost levers for sustainable edge inference.

Abstract: Large language models often face a three-way trade-off among detection accuracy, inference latency, and deployment cost when used in real-world safety-sensitive applications. This paper introduces Prefix Probing, a black-box harmful content detection method that compares the conditional log-probabilities of "agreement/execution" versus "refusal/safety" opening prefixes and leverages prefix caching to reduce detection overhead to near first-token latency. During inference, the method requires only a single log-probability computation over the probe prefixes to produce a harmfulness score and apply a threshold, without invoking any additional models or multi-stage inference. To further enhance the discriminative power of the prefixes, we design an efficient prefix construction algorithm that automatically discovers highly informative prefixes, substantially improving detection performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Prefix Probing achieves detection effectiveness comparable to mainstream external safety models while incurring only minimal computational cost and requiring no extra model deployment, highlighting its strong practicality and efficiency.

Abstract: The rapid assimilation of Artificial Intelligence technologies into various facets of society has created a significant educational imperative that current frameworks are failing to effectively address. We are witnessing the rise of a dangerous literacy gap, where a focus on the functional, operational skills of using AI tools is eclipsing the development of critical and ethical reasoning about them. This position paper argues for a systemic shift toward comprehensive AI literacy that centers human agency - the empowered capacity for intentional, critical, and responsible choice. This principle applies to all stakeholders in the educational ecosystem: it is the student's agency to question, create with, or consciously decide not to use AI based on the task; it is the teacher's agency to design learning experiences that align with instructional values, rather than ceding pedagogical control to a tool. True literacy involves teaching about agency itself, framing technology not as an inevitability to be adopted, but as a choice to be made. This requires a deep commitment to critical thinking and a robust understanding of epistemology. Through the AI Literacy, Fluency, and Competency frameworks described in this paper, educators and students will become agents in their own human-centric approaches to AI, providing necessary pathways to clearly articulate the intentions informing decisions and attitudes toward AI and the impact of these decisions on academic work, career, and society.

Abstract: This research stems from the urgency to automate the thematic grouping of hadith in line with the growing digitalization of Islamic texts. Based on a literature review, the unsupervised learning approach with the Apriori algorithm has proven effective in identifying association patterns and semantic relations in unlabeled text data. The dataset used is the Indonesian Translation of the hadith of Bukhari, which first goes through preprocessing stages including case folding, punctuation cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming. Next, an association rule mining analysis was conducted using the Apriori algorithm with support, confidence, and lift parameters. The results show the existence of meaningful association patterns such as the relationship between rakaat-prayer, verse-revelation, and hadith-story, which describe the themes of worship, revelation, and hadith narration. These findings demonstrate that the Apriori algorithm has the ability to automatically uncover latent semantic relationships, while contributing to the development of digital Islamic studies and technology-based learning systems.

TL;DR: 该研究系统比较了单智能体与多智能体流水线在视觉数学基准测试上的表现，发现开源模型使用多智能体有明显优势，而闭源模型在传统基准上单智能体表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在几何解题能力评估中，多智能体设计相比单智能体的优势尚不明确，需要系统性比较两者在不同视觉数学基准上的表现差异。

Method: 在四个视觉数学基准（Geometry3K、MathVerse、OlympiadBench和We-Math）上系统比较单智能体与多智能体流水线，测试了开源模型Qwen-2.5-VL和闭源模型Gemini-2.0-Flash。

Result: 开源模型在多智能体模式下表现显著提升（如Qwen-2.5-VL在Geometry3K上分别获得+6.8和+3.3分提高）；闭源模型在传统基准上单智能体更优，仅在较新数据集We-Math上多智能体带来适度改善。

Conclusion: 多智能体流水线对开源模型有明显益处，对强大闭源系统在新颖基准上也有辅助作用，但智能体分解并非普遍最优策略。

Abstract: Diagram-grounded geometry problem solving is a critical benchmark for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), yet the benefits of multi-agent design over single-agent remain unclear. We systematically compare single-agent and multi-agent pipelines on four visual math benchmarks: Geometry3K, MathVerse, OlympiadBench, and We-Math. For open-source models, multi-agent consistently improves performance. For example, Qwen-2.5-VL (7B) gains +6.8 points and Qwen-2.5-VL (32B) gains +3.3 on Geometry3K, and both Qwen-2.5-VL variants see further gains on OlympiadBench and We-Math. In contrast, the closed-source Gemini-2.0-Flash generally performs better in single-agent mode on classic benchmarks, while multi-agent yields only modest improvements on the newer We-Math dataset. These findings show that multi-agent pipelines provide clear benefits for open-source models and can assist strong proprietary systems on newer, less familiar benchmarks, but agentic decomposition is not universally optimal.

Method: 采用形式化方法，将哥德尔不完备性定理（形式不完整性）和混沌理论中的有限精度下长期预测的不可行性（动态不可预测性）结合起来，分析这两种极端情况对智能体自我推理能力的结构性限制。

Result: 证明算法智能体在一般情况下无法计算自身的最大预测范围，揭示了智能系统在推理、预测和自我分析之间的内在权衡关系。

Conclusion: 形式不完整性和动态不可预测性共同构成了算法智能的基本限制，这种结构性约束澄清了智能系统中推理、预测和自我分析之间存在的固有权衡，对人工智能的基础理论有着重要启示。

Abstract: We formalize two independent computational limitations that constrain algorithmic intelligence: formal incompleteness and dynamical unpredictability. The former limits the deductive power of consistent reasoning systems while the later bounds long-term prediction under finite precision. We show that these two extrema together impose structural bounds on an agent's ability to reason about its own predictive capabilities. In particular, an algorithmic agent cannot compute its own maximal prediction horizon generally. This perspective clarifies inherent trade-offs between reasoning, prediction, and self-analysis in intelligent systems.

Abstract: Black-box AI (BBAI) systems such as foundational models are increasingly being used for sequential decision making. To ensure that such systems are safe to operate and deploy, it is imperative to develop efficient methods that can provide a sound and interpretable representation of the BBAI's capabilities. This paper shows that PDDL-style representations can be used to efficiently learn and model an input BBAI's planning capabilities. It uses the Monte-Carlo tree search paradigm to systematically create test tasks, acquire data, and prune the hypothesis space of possible symbolic models. Learned models describe a BBAI's capabilities, the conditions under which they can be executed, and the possible outcomes of executing them along with their associated probabilities. Theoretical results show soundness, completeness and convergence of the learned models. Empirical results with multiple BBAI systems illustrate the scope, efficiency, and accuracy of the presented methods.

Abstract: Lung cancer patients frequently experience breakthrough pain episodes, with up to 91% requiring timely intervention. To enable proactive pain management, we propose a hybrid machine learning and large language model pipeline that predicts pain episodes within 48 and 72 hours of hospitalization using both structured and unstructured electronic health record data. A retrospective cohort of 266 inpatients was analyzed, with features including demographics, tumor stage, vital signs, and WHO-tiered analgesic use. The machine learning module captured temporal medication trends, while the large language model interpreted ambiguous dosing records and free-text clinical notes. Integrating these modalities improved sensitivity and interpretability. Our framework achieved an accuracy of 0.874 (48h) and 0.917 (72h), with an improvement in sensitivity of 8.6% and 10.4% due to the augmentation of large language model. This hybrid approach offers a clinically interpretable and scalable tool for early pain episode forecasting, with potential to enhance treatment precision and optimize resource allocation in oncology care.

TL;DR: 本文提出CitySeeker基准评测VLM在动态城市环境中理解隐含人类需求的能力，发现当前最优模型在6,440条轨迹上仅实现21.1%任务完成率，揭示了长时推理误差累积、空间认知不足和体验记忆缺失等关键瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视觉语言模型在显式指令导航方面进展显著，但其在动态城市环境中理解隐形人类需求（如'我渴了'）的能力仍有待探索。现有研究对此类蕴含式需求的探索尚不充分，因此需要专门基准来评估VLM的时空推理和决策能力。

Method: 开发CitySeeker包含8个城市、6,440条轨迹和7个目标驱动场景的基准；进行大量实验评估当前最佳模型性能；基于人类认知地图理论提出回溯机制-增强空间认知-记忆检索(BCR)策略组合进行深入分析。

Result: 实验显示即使最佳模型(Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct)任务完成率仅为21.1%；识别出三个关键瓶颈:长视界推理中的误差累积、空间认知不足、体验记忆缺失；提出的BCR策略为改进提供了方向。

Conclusion: CitySeeker基准揭示了VLM在城市隐含需求导航中的显著不足，为解决'最后一公里'导航挑战提供了重要洞察，并为开发具有鲁棒空间智能的VLM指明了方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have made significant progress in explicit instruction-based navigation; however, their ability to interpret implicit human needs (e.g., "I am thirsty") in dynamic urban environments remains underexplored. This paper introduces CitySeeker, a novel benchmark designed to assess VLMs' spatial reasoning and decision-making capabilities for exploring embodied urban navigation to address implicit needs. CitySeeker includes 6,440 trajectories across 8 cities, capturing diverse visual characteristics and implicit needs in 7 goal-driven scenarios. Extensive experiments reveal that even top-performing models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-32B-Instruct) achieve only 21.1% task completion. We find key bottlenecks in error accumulation in long-horizon reasoning, inadequate spatial cognition, and deficient experiential recall. To further analyze them, we investigate a series of exploratory strategies-Backtracking Mechanisms, Enriching Spatial Cognition, and Memory-Based Retrieval (BCR), inspired by human cognitive mapping's emphasis on iterative observation-reasoning cycles and adaptive path optimization. Our analysis provides actionable insights for developing VLMs with robust spatial intelligence required for tackling "last-mile" navigation challenges.

Abstract: Modern bioimage analysis approaches are data hungry, making it necessary for researchers to scavenge data beyond those collected within their (bio)imaging facilities. In addition to scale, bioimaging datasets must be accompanied with suitable, high-quality annotations and metadata. Although established data repositories such as the Image Data Resource (IDR) and BioImage Archive offer rich metadata, their contents typically cannot be directly consumed by image analysis tools without substantial data wrangling. Such a tedious assembly and conversion of (meta)data can account for a dedicated amount of time investment for researchers, hindering the development of more powerful analysis tools. Here, we introduce BioimageAIpub, a workflow that streamlines bioimaging data conversion, enabling a seamless upload to HuggingFace, a widely used platform for sharing machine learning datasets and models.

Conclusion: SNIC是第一个同时提供RAW和TIFF格式的合成噪声图像数据集，为高质量异方差噪声建模提供了有效方法和数据集资源。

Abstract: Advanced denoising algorithms require large, high-quality datasets. Physics-based, statistical noise models can create such datasets by realistically simulating noise in digital images. However, there is little information on the correct way to calibrate and tune these heteroscedastic models, and a lack of published datasets using them. In this paper, we explore the process of building high-quality heteroscedastic noise models. Our methods produce realistic synthesized noisy images, in both RAW and TIFF formats. Our synthesized noisy images achieve comparable LPIPS results to real noisy images, and greatly outperform those created with manufacturer-provided DNG noise models both in LPIPS and when tested with a state-of-the-art (SOTA) denoising model. Using our approach, we created the Synthesized Noisy Images using Calibration dataset (SNIC) containing over 6000 noisy images, comprising 30 scenes from four sensors, including two smartphone sensors, a point-and-shoot, and a DSLR. SNIC is the first synthesized noisy image dataset provided in both RAW and TIFF format.

Abstract: Purpose AI-based methods for anatomy segmentation can help automate characterization of large imaging datasets. The growing number of similar in functionality models raises the challenge of evaluating them on datasets that do not contain ground truth annotations. We introduce a practical framework to assist in this task. Approach We harmonize the segmentation results into a standard, interoperable representation, which enables consistent, terminology-based labeling of the structures. We extend 3D Slicer to streamline loading and comparison of these harmonized segmentations, and demonstrate how standard representation simplifies review of the results using interactive summary plots and browser-based visualization using OHIF Viewer. To demonstrate the utility of the approach we apply it to evaluating segmentation of 31 anatomical structures (lungs, vertebrae, ribs, and heart) by six open-source models - TotalSegmentator 1.5 and 2.6, Auto3DSeg, MOOSE, MultiTalent, and CADS - for a sample of Computed Tomography (CT) scans from the publicly available National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) dataset. Results We demonstrate the utility of the framework in enabling automating loading, structure-wise inspection and comparison across models. Preliminary results ascertain practical utility of the approach in allowing quick detection and review of problematic results. The comparison shows excellent agreement segmenting some (e.g., lung) but not all structures (e.g., some models produce invalid vertebrae or rib segmentations). Conclusions The resources developed are linked from https://imagingdatacommons.github.io/segmentation-comparison/ including segmentation harmonization scripts, summary plots, and visualization tools. This work assists in model evaluation in absence of ground truth, ultimately enabling informed model selection.

Abstract: Tau positron emission tomography (PET) is a critical diagnostic modality for Alzheimer's disease (AD) because it visualizes and quantifies neurofibrillary tangles, a hallmark of AD pathology. However, its widespread clinical adoption is hindered by significant challenges, such as radiation exposure, limited availability, high clinical workload, and substantial financial costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose Multi-scale CBAM Residual Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network (MCR-VQGAN) to synthesize high-fidelity tau PET images from structural T1-weighted MRI scans. MCR-VQGAN improves standard VQGAN by integrating three key architectural enhancements: multi-scale convolutions, ResNet blocks, and Convolutional Block Attention Modules (CBAM). Using 222 paired structural T1-weighted MRI and tau PET scans from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we trained and compared MCR-VQGAN with cGAN, WGAN-GP, CycleGAN, and VQGAN. Our proposed model achieved superior image synthesis performance across all metrics: MSE of 0.0056 +/- 0.0061, PSNR of 24.39 +/- 4.49 dB, and SSIM of 0.9000 +/- 0.0453. To assess the clinical utility of the synthetic images, we trained and evaluated a CNN-based AD classifier. The classifier achieved comparable accuracy when tested on real (63.64%) and synthetic (65.91%) images. This result indicates that our synthesis process successfully preserves diagnostically relevant features without significant information loss. Our results demonstrate that MCR-VQGAN can offer a reliable and scalable surrogate for conventional tau PET imaging, potentially improving the accessibility and scalability of tau imaging biomarkers for AD research and clinical workflows.

Abstract: Fisher information and Shannon entropy are fundamental tools for understanding and analyzing dynamical systems from complementary perspectives. They can characterize unknown parameters by quantifying the information contained in variables, or measure how different initial trajectories or temporal segments of a trajectory contribute to learning or inferring system dynamics. In this work, we leverage the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) within the data-driven framework of {\em sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics} (SINDy). We visualize information patterns in chaotic and non-chaotic systems for both single trajectories and multiple initial conditions, demonstrating how information-based analysis can improve sampling efficiency and enhance model performance by prioritizing more informative data. The benefits of statistical bagging are further elucidated through spectral analysis of the FIM. We also illustrate how Fisher information and entropy metrics can promote data efficiency in three scenarios: when only a single trajectory is available, when a tunable control parameter exists, and when multiple trajectories can be freely initialized. As data-driven model discovery continues to gain prominence, principled sampling strategies guided by quantifiable information metrics offer a powerful approach for improving learning efficiency and reducing data requirements.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Decentralized secure aggregation (DSA) considers a fully-connected network of $K$ users, where each pair of users can communicate bidirectionally over an error-free channel. Each user holds a private input, and the goal is for each user to compute the sum of all inputs without revealing any additional information, even in the presence of collusion among up to $T$ users. Traditional DSA typically requires large key sizes to protect all information except for the input sum and the information of colluding users. To mitigate the source keys overhead, we study decentralized secure aggregation with arbitrary collusion and heterogeneous security constraints. In this setting, the inputs of a predefined collection of user subsets, called the \emph{security set} $\bm{\mathcal{S}}$, must be protected from another predefined collection, the \emph{collusion set} $\bm{\mathcal{T}}$. For an arbitrary security set $\mathcal{S}\in \bm{\mathcal{S}}$ and an arbitrary collusion set $\mathcal{T}\in \bm{\mathcal{T}}$, we characterize the optimal communication and source key rates. A key contribution of this work is the characterization of the optimal source key rate, i.e., the minimum number of key bits per input bit that must be shared among users for decentralized secure aggregation with arbitrary collusion and heterogeneous security constraints to be feasible. In general, this characterization reduces to solving a linear program.

Motivation: 虽然部分信息分解（PID）的理论发展和应用广泛，但缺乏普遍接受的标准解决方案。本文旨在通过建立矛盾性结果，揭示PID必须放弃至少一个经典信息论的基本性质，从而推动该领域的理论澄清和选择。

Method: 利用最近发展的部分信息分解的总体论（mereological）方法，提出并证明了一个主要定理，展示了非负性、链式法则和可逆变换不变性在PID设置下的互不相容性。

Result: 主要定理表明任何PID框架都必须舍弃至少一个经典信息论的核心性质。此外，该研究强化了Rauh等人的经典结果，显示非负性、恒等性以及Williams和Beer公理无法共存。

Conclusion: 本文的矛盾性结果强调了在PID理论发展中必须做出根本性选择，即放弃某些经典信息论的基本性质。这为PID的未来发展提供了重要的理论边界和指导方向。

Abstract: Partial Information Decomposition (PID) seeks to disentangle how information about a target variable is distributed across multiple sources, separating redundant, unique, and synergistic contributions. Despite extensive theoretical development and applications across diverse fields, the search for a unique, universally accepted solution remains elusive, with numerous competing proposals offering different decompositions. A promising but underutilized strategy for making progress is to establish inconsistency results, proofs that certain combinations of intuitively appealing axioms cannot be simultaneously satisfied. Such results clarify the landscape of possibilities and force us to recognize where fundamental choices must be made. In this work, we leverage the recently developed mereological approach to PID to establish novel inconsistency results with far-reaching implications. Our main theorem demonstrates that three cornerstone properties of classical information theory, namely non-negativity, the chain rule, and invariance under invertible transformations, become mutually incompatible when extended to the PID setting. This result reveals that any PID framework must sacrifice at least one property that seems fundamental to information theory itself. Additionally, we strengthen the classical result of Rauh et al., which showed that non-negativity, the identity property, and the Williams and Beer axioms cannot coexist.

Abstract: This paper investigates two distinct types of block errors - undetected errors (confusions) and erasures - in additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels with error-bounded block decoders operating in the finite blocklength (FBL) regime. While block error rate (BLER) is a common metric, it does not distinguish between confusions and erasures, which can have significantly different impacts in cross-layer protocol design, despite upper-layer protocols universally assuming physical (PHY) errors manifest as packet erasures rather than undetected corruptions - an assumption lacking rigorous PHY-layer validation. We present a systematic analysis of confusions and erasures under BLER-constrained maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. Through sphere-packing analysis, we provide analytical bounds for both block confusion and erasure probabilities, and derive the sensitivities of these bounds to blocklength and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on this topic in the FBL regime. Our findings provide theoretical validation for the block erasure channel abstraction commonly assumed in medium access control (MAC) and network layer protocols, confirming that, for practical FBL codes, block confusions are negligible compared to block erasures, especially at large blocklengths and high SNR.

Abstract: Molecular Communication (MC) is an emerging field of research focused on understanding how cells in the human body communicate and exploring potential medical applications. In theoretical analysis, the goal is to investigate cellular communication mechanisms and develop nanomachine-assisted therapies to combat diseases. Since cells transmit information by releasing molecules at varying intensities, this process is commonly modeled using Poisson channels. In our study, we consider a discrete-time Poisson channel (DTPC). MC is often event-driven, making traditional Shannon communication an unsuitable performance metric. Instead, we adopt the identification framework introduced by Ahlswede and Dueck. In this approach, the receiver is only concerned with detecting whether a specific message of interest has been transmitted. Unlike Shannon transmission codes, the size of identification (ID) codes for a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) increases doubly exponentially with blocklength when using randomized encoding. This remarkable property makes the ID paradigm significantly more efficient than classical Shannon transmission in terms of energy consumption and hardware requirements. Another critical aspect of MC, influenced by the concept of the Internet of Bio-NanoThings, is security. In-body communication must be protected against potential eavesdroppers. To address this, we first analyze the DTPC for randomized identification (RI) and then extend our study to secure randomized identification (SRI). We derive capacity formulas for both RI and SRI, providing a comprehensive understanding of their performance and security implications.

Abstract: In this paper, we clarify several issues concerning the abstract geometrical formulation of thermodynamics on non compact symmetric spaces $\mathrm{U/H}$ that are the mathematical model of hidden layers in the new paradigm of Cartan Neural Networks. We introduce a distinction between the generalized thermodynamics associated with Dynamical Systems and the challenging proposal of Gibbs probability distributions on $\mathrm{U/H}$ provided by generalized thermodynamics {à} la Souriau. Main result is the proof that $\mathrm{U/H}$.s supporting Gibbs distributions are only the Kähler ones. For the latter, we solve the problem of determining the space of temperatures, namely of Lie algebra elements for which the partition function converges. The space of generalized temperatures is the orbit under the adjoint action of $\mathrm{U}$ of a positivity domain in the Cartan subalgebra $C_c\subset\mathbb{H}$ of the maximal compact subalgebra $\mathbb{H}\subset\mathbb{U}$. We illustrate how our explicit constructions for the Poincaré and Siegel planes might be extended to the whole class of Calabi-Vesentini manifolds utilizing Paint Group symmetry. Furthermore we claim that Rao's, Chentsov's, Amari's Information Geometry and the thermodynamical geometry of Ruppeiner and Lychagin are the very same thing. The most important property of the Gibbs probability distributions provided by the here introduced setup is their covariance with respect to the action of the full group of symmetries $\mathrm{U}$. The partition function is invariant against $\mathrm{U}$ transformations and the set of its arguments, namely the generalized temperatures, can be always reduced to a minimal set whose cardinality is equal to the rank of the compact denominator group $\mathrm{H}\subset \mathrm{U}$.

Abstract: A non-uniform channel input distribution is key for achieving the capacity of arbitrary channels. However, message bits are generally assumed to follow a uniform distribution which must first be transformed to a non-uniform distribution by using a distribution matching algorithm. One such algorithm is enumerative sphere shaping (ESS). Compared to algorithms such as constant composition distribution matching (CCDM), ESS can utilize more channel input symbol sequences, allowing it to achieve a comparably low rate loss. However, the distribution of channel input symbols produced by ESS is fixed, restricting the utility of ESS to channels with Gaussian-like capacity-achieving input distributions. In this paper, we generalize ESS to produce arbitrary discrete channel input distributions, making it usable on most channels. Crucially, our generalization replaces fixed weights used internally by ESS with weights depending on the desired channel input distribution. We present numerical simulations using generalized ESS with probabilistic amplitude shaping (PAS) to transmit sequences of 256 symbols over a simplified model of an unamplified coherent optical link, a channel with a distinctly non-Gaussian capacity-achieving input distribution. In these simulations, we found that generalized ESS improves the maximum transmission rate by 0.0425 bit/symbol at a frame error rate below 10^{-4} compared to CCDM.

Abstract: Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) technology has emerged as a promising technology to enable massive connectivity and enhanced spectral efficiency in next-generation wireless networks. In this study, we propose a novel two-user downlink power-domain NOMA framework that integrates a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)-aided Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) with successive interference cancellation (SIC). Unlike conventional SIC methods, which are susceptible to error propagation when there is low power disparity between users, the proposed scheme leverages GRAND's noise-centric strategy to systematically rank and test candidate error patterns until the correct codeword is identified. In this architecture, CRC is utilized not only to detect errors but also to aid the decoding process, effectively eliminating the need for separate Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes and reducing overall system overhead. Furthermore, the strong user enhances its decoding performance by applying SIC that is reinforced by GRAND-based decoding of the weaker user's signals, thereby minimizing error propagation and increasing throughput. Comprehensive simulation results over both Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels, under varying power allocations and user distances, show that the CRC-aided GRAND-NOMA approach significantly improves the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance compared to state-of-the-art NOMA decoding techniques. These findings underscore the potential of integrating universal decoding methods like GRAND into interference-limited multiuser environments for robust future wireless networks.

Abstract: We propose DiscoverDCP, a data-driven framework that integrates symbolic regression with the rule sets of Disciplined Convex Programming (DCP) to perform system identification. By enforcing that all discovered candidate model expressions adhere to DCP composition rules, we ensure that the output expressions are globally convex by construction, circumventing the computationally intractable process of post-hoc convexity verification. This approach allows for the discovery of convex surrogates that exhibit more relaxed and accurate functional forms than traditional fixed-parameter convex expressions (e.g., quadratic functions). The proposed method produces interpretable, verifiable, and flexible convex models suitable for safety-critical control and optimization tasks.

Motivation: 金融市场价格预测是机器学习的挑战性应用，由于高噪声、非平稳性和市场有效性，大多数模型难以超过55-57%的准确率。先前方法存在三个主要局限性：架构多样性不足、情感分析方法有限、以及弱预测器对集成性能的影响。

Abstract: Financial market prediction is a challenging application of machine learning, where even small improvements in directional accuracy can yield substantial value. Most models struggle to exceed 55--57\% accuracy due to high noise, non-stationarity, and market efficiency. We introduce a hybrid ensemble framework combining quantum sentiment analysis, Decision Transformer architecture, and strategic model selection, achieving 60.14\% directional accuracy on S\&P 500 prediction, a 3.10\% improvement over individual models.
  Our framework addresses three limitations of prior approaches. First, architecture diversity dominates dataset diversity: combining different learning algorithms (LSTM, Decision Transformer, XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression) on the same data outperforms training identical architectures on multiple datasets (60.14\% vs.\ 52.80\%), confirmed by correlation analysis ($r>0.6$ among same-architecture models). Second, a 4-qubit variational quantum circuit enhances sentiment analysis, providing +0.8\% to +1.5\% gains per model. Third, smart filtering excludes weak predictors (accuracy $<52\%$), improving ensemble performance (Top-7 models: 60.14\% vs.\ all 35 models: 51.2\%).
  We evaluate on 2020--2023 market data across seven instruments, covering diverse regimes including the COVID-19 crash and inflation-driven correction. McNemar's test confirms statistical significance ($p<0.05$). Preliminary backtesting with confidence-based filtering (6+ model consensus) yields a Sharpe ratio of 1.2 versus buy-and-hold's 0.8, demonstrating practical trading potential.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) face a fundamental memory wall: their learned basis functions create parameter counts that impose extreme bandwidth demands, hindering deployment in memory-constrained environments. We show that Vision KANs exhibit a holographic topology, where information is distributed across the interference of splines rather than localized to specific edges. Consequently, traditional pruning fails (10% sparsity degrades mAP from 85.23% to 45%, a $\sim$40-point drop). To address this, we present SHARe-KAN, a framework utilizing Gain-Shape-Bias Vector Quantization to exploit functional redundancy while preserving the dense topology. Coupled with LUTHAM, a hardware-aware compiler with static memory planning, we achieve $88\times$ runtime memory reduction (1.13 GB $\to$ 12.91 MB) and match uncompressed baseline accuracy on PASCAL VOC. Profiling on NVIDIA Ampere architecture confirms $>90\%$ L2 cache residency, demonstrating that the workload is decoupled from DRAM bandwidth constraints inherent to spline-based architectures.

Abstract: Spectral graph neural networks (GNNs) are highly effective in modeling graph signals, with their success in recommendation often attributed to low-pass filtering. However, recent studies highlight the importance of high-frequency signals. The role of low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals in recommendation remains unclear. This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the influence of graph signals on recommendation performance. We theoretically prove that the effects of low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals are equivalent in recommendation tasks, as both contribute by smoothing the similarities between user-item pairs. To leverage this insight, we propose a frequency signal scaler, a plug-and-play module that adjusts the graph signal filter function to fine-tune the smoothness between user-item pairs, making it compatible with any GNN model. Additionally, we identify and prove that graph embedding-based methods cannot fully capture the characteristics of graph signals. To address this limitation, a space flip method is introduced to restore the expressive power of graph embeddings. Remarkably, we demonstrate that either low-frequency or high-frequency graph signals alone are sufficient for effective recommendations. Extensive experiments on four public datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. Code is avaliable at https://github.com/mojosey/SimGCF.

Abstract: This paper presents LLaDA2.0 -- a tuple of discrete diffusion large language models (dLLM) scaling up to 100B total parameters through systematic conversion from auto-regressive (AR) models -- establishing a new paradigm for frontier-scale deployment. Instead of costly training from scratch, LLaDA2.0 upholds knowledge inheritance, progressive adaption and efficiency-aware design principle, and seamless converts a pre-trained AR model into dLLM with a novel 3-phase block-level WSD based training scheme: progressive increasing block-size in block diffusion (warm-up), large-scale full-sequence diffusion (stable) and reverting back to compact-size block diffusion (decay). Along with post-training alignment with SFT and DPO, we obtain LLaDA2.0-mini (16B) and LLaDA2.0-flash (100B), two instruction-tuned Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) variants optimized for practical deployment. By preserving the advantages of parallel decoding, these models deliver superior performance and efficiency at the frontier scale. Both models were open-sourced.

Abstract: Inverse design of heterogeneous material microstructures is a fundamentally ill-posed and famously computationally expensive problem. This is exacerbated by the high-dimensional design spaces associated with finely resolved images, multimodal input property streams, and a highly nonlinear forward physics. Whilst modern generative models excel at accurately modeling such complex forward behavior, most of them are not intrinsically structured to support fast, stable \emph{deterministic} inversion with a physics-informed bias. This work introduces Janus, a unified generative-predictive framework to address this problem. Janus couples a deep encoder-decoder architecture with a predictive KHRONOS head, a separable neural architecture. Topologically speaking, Janus learns a latent manifold simultaneously isometric for generative inversion and pruned for physical prediction; the joint objective inducing \emph{disentanglement} of the latent space. Janus is first validated on the MNIST dataset, demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction, accurate classification and diverse generative inversion of all ten target classes. It is then applied to the inverse design of heterogeneous microstructures labeled with thermal conductivity. It achieves a forward prediction accuracy $R^2=0.98$ (2\% relative error) and sub-5\% pixelwise reconstruction error. Inverse solutions satisfy target properties to within $1\%$ relative error. Inverting a sweep through properties reveal smooth traversal of the latent manifold, and UMAP visualization confirms the emergence of a low-dimensional, disentangled manifold. By unifying prediction and generation within a single latent space, Janus enables real-time, physics-informed inverse microstructure generation at a lower computational cost typically associated with classical optimization-based approaches.

Conclusion: 数据多样性对缓解零样本分类中的人口统计偏见至关重要；D3G通过生成多样化人口数据实现了准确性与公平性的双重提升，为减轻模型偏见提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Image classification is a task essential for machine perception to achieve human-level image understanding. Multimodal models such as CLIP have been able to perform well on this task by learning semantic similarities across vision and language; however, despite these advances, image classification is still a challenging task. Models with low capacity often suffer from underfitting and thus underperform on fine-grained image classification. Along with this, it is important to ensure high-quality data with rich cross-modal representations of each class, which is often difficult to generate. When datasets do not enforce balanced demographics, the predictions will be biased toward the more represented class, while others will be neglected. We focus on how these issues can lead to harmful bias for zero-shot image classification, and explore how to combat these issues in demographic bias. We propose Diverse Demographic Data Generation (D3G), a training-free, zero-shot method of boosting classification accuracy while reducing demographic bias in pre-trained multimodal models. With this method, we utilize CLIP as our base multimodal model and Stable Diffusion XL as our generative model. We demonstrate that providing diverse demographic data at inference time improves performance for these models, and explore the impact of individual demographics on the resulting accuracy metric.

Abstract: Visual Species Recognition (VSR) is pivotal to biodiversity assessment and conservation, evolution research, and ecology and ecosystem management. Training a machine-learned model for VSR typically requires vast amounts of annotated images. Yet, species-level annotation demands domain expertise, making it realistic for domain experts to annotate only a few examples. These limited labeled data motivate training an ''expert'' model via few-shot learning (FSL). Meanwhile, advanced Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated prominent performance on general recognition tasks. It is straightforward to ask whether LMMs excel in the highly specialized VSR task and whether they outshine FSL expert models. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that LMMs struggle in this task, despite using various established prompting techniques. LMMs even significantly underperform FSL expert models, which are as simple as finetuning a pretrained visual encoder on the few-shot images. However, our in-depth analysis reveals that LMMs can effectively post-hoc correct the expert models' incorrect predictions. Briefly, given a test image, when prompted with the top predictions from an FSL expert model, LMMs can recover the ground-truth label. Building on this insight, we derive a simple method called Post-hoc Correction (POC), which prompts an LMM to re-rank the expert model's top predictions using enriched prompts that include softmax confidence scores and few-shot visual examples. Across five challenging VSR benchmarks, POC outperforms prior art of FSL by +6.4% in accuracy without extra training, validation, or manual intervention. Importantly, POC generalizes to different pretrained backbones and LMMs, serving as a plug-and-play module to significantly enhance existing FSL methods.

Abstract: Agentic Workflows (AWs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for solving complex tasks. However, the scalability of automating their generation is severely constrained by the high cost and latency of execution-based evaluation. Existing AW performance prediction methods act as surrogates but fail to simultaneously capture the intricate topological dependencies and the deep semantic logic embedded in AWs. To address this limitation, we propose GLOW, a unified framework for AW performance prediction that combines the graph-structure modeling capabilities of GNNs with the reasoning power of LLMs. Specifically, we introduce a graph-oriented LLM, instruction-tuned on graph tasks, to extract topologically aware semantic features, which are fused with GNN-encoded structural representations. A contrastive alignment strategy further refines the latent space to distinguish high-quality AWs. Extensive experiments on FLORA-Bench show that GLOW outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in prediction accuracy and ranking utility.

Abstract: Encrypted traffic classification aims to identify applications or services by analyzing network traffic data. One of the critical challenges is the continuous emergence of new applications, which generates Out-of-Distribution (OOD) traffic patterns that deviate from known categories and are not well represented by predefined models. Current approaches rely on predefined categories, which limits their effectiveness in handling unknown traffic types. Although some methods mitigate this limitation by simply classifying unknown traffic into a single "Other" category, they fail to make a fine-grained classification. In this paper, we propose a Two-stage Adaptive OOD classification Network (TAO-Net) that achieves accurate classification for both In-Distribution (ID) and OOD encrypted traffic. The method incorporates an innovative two-stage design: the first stage employs a hybrid OOD detection mechanism that integrates transformer-based inter-layer transformation smoothness and feature analysis to effectively distinguish between ID and OOD traffic, while the second stage leverages large language models with a novel semantic-enhanced prompt strategy to transform OOD traffic classification into a generation task, enabling flexible fine-grained classification without relying on predefined labels. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that TAO-Net achieves 96.81-97.70% macro-precision and 96.77-97.68% macro-F1, outperforming previous methods that only reach 44.73-86.30% macro-precision, particularly in identifying emerging network applications.

Abstract: Interpreting complex datasets remains a major challenge for scientists, particularly due to high dimensionality and collinearity among variables. We introduce a novel application of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to enhance interpretability and parsimony beyond what traditional correlation analyses offer. We present two interpretable, color-coded visualization tools: the Pairwise KAN Matrix (PKAN) and the Multivariate KAN Contribution Matrix (MKAN). PKAN characterizes nonlinear associations between pairs of variables, while MKAN serves as a nonlinear feature-ranking tool that quantifies the relative contributions of inputs in predicting a target variable. These tools support pre-processing (e.g., feature selection, redundancy analysis) and post-processing (e.g., model explanation, physical insights) in model development workflows. Through experimental comparisons, we demonstrate that PKAN and MKAN yield more robust and informative results than Pearson Correlation and Mutual Information. By capturing the strength and functional forms of relationships, these matrices facilitate the discovery of hidden physical patterns and promote domain-informed model development.

Abstract: Designing nuclear reactor cores requires navigating large discrete design spaces governed by complex neutronic interactions. Traditional deterministic, metaheuristic, and machine-learning-assisted methods search within fixed, human-defined configuration spaces, limiting their ability to discover fundamentally new design topologies. Here we introduce ReactorFold, a generative framework that reformulates fuel-assembly design as a sequence modeling problem for language models. Using Monte Carlo data, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), the model learns the latent structure of a pressurized-water-reactor assembly and generates candidate layouts in a single forward pass. Notably, the DPO-aligned model exhibits emergent design-space expansion: despite being trained exclusively on configurations with a fixed number of gadolinium burnable absorber (Gd) rods, it autonomously adjusts Gd inventory to satisfy strict power-peaking constraints. The model also discovers high-performing asymmetric configurations that challenge conventional symmetric loading heuristics, accessing design regimes inaccessible to conventional search methods and demonstrating that language models can internalize causal physical relationships and transcend human-imposed design constraints.

Abstract: Multi-view learning (MVL) is an emerging field in machine learning that focuses on improving generalization performance by leveraging complementary information from multiple perspectives or views. Various multi-view support vector machine (MvSVM) approaches have been developed, demonstrating significant success. Moreover, these models face challenges in effectively capturing decision boundaries in high-dimensional spaces using the kernel trick. They are also prone to errors and struggle with view inconsistencies, which are common in multi-view datasets. In this work, we introduce the multiview twin restricted kernel machine (TMvRKM), a novel model that integrates the strengths of kernel machines with the multiview framework, addressing key computational and generalization challenges associated with traditional kernel-based approaches. Unlike traditional methods that rely on solving large quadratic programming problems (QPPs), the proposed TMvRKM efficiently determines an optimal separating hyperplane through a regularized least squares approach, enhancing both computational efficiency and classification performance. The primal objective of TMvRKM includes a coupling term designed to balance errors across multiple views effectively. By integrating early and late fusion strategies, TMvRKM leverages the collective information from all views during training while remaining flexible to variations specific to individual views. The proposed TMvRKM model is rigorously tested on UCI, KEEL, and AwA benchmark datasets. Both experimental results and statistical analyses consistently highlight its exceptional generalization performance, outperforming baseline models in every scenario.

Abstract: Industry 4.0 is growing quickly, which has changed smart production by encouraging the use of real-time tracking, machine learning, and AI-driven systems to make operations run more smoothly. The main focus of this dissertation is on creating and testing an intelligent production system for XRIT that solves important problems like energy management, predictive maintenance, and AI-powered decision support. Machine learning models are built into the system, such as the Random Forest Classifier for proactive maintenance and the Isolation Forest for finding outliers. These models help with decision-making and reducing downtime. Streamlit makes real-time data visualisation possible, giving workers access to dashboards that they can interact with and see real-time observations.The system was tested with fake data and is made to be scalable, so it can be used in real time in XRIT's production setting. Adding an AI-powered virtual assistant made with GPT-4 lets workers get real-time, useful information that makes complicated questions easier to answer and improves operational decisions. The testing shows that the system makes working efficiency, energy management, and the ability to plan repairs much better. Moving the system to real-time data merging and looking for other ways to make it better will be the main focus of future work.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across distributed data sources but suffers from slow convergence under non-IID data conditions. Existing solutions employ algorithmic modifications treating all client updates identically, ignoring semantic validity. We introduce Semantic-Constrained Federated Aggregation (SCFA), a theoretically-grounded framework incorporating domain knowledge constraints into distributed optimization. We prove SCFA achieves convergence rate O(1/sqrt(T) + rho) where rho represents constraint violation rate, establishing the first convergence theory for constraint-based federated learning. Our analysis shows constraints reduce effective data heterogeneity by 41% and improve privacy-utility tradeoffs through hypothesis space reduction by factor theta=0.37. Under (epsilon,delta)-differential privacy with epsilon=10, constraint regularization maintains utility within 3.7% of non-private baseline versus 12.1% degradation for standard federated learning, representing 2.7x improvement. We validate our framework on manufacturing predictive maintenance using Bosch production data with 1.18 million samples and 968 sensor features, constructing knowledge graphs encoding 3,000 constraints from ISA-95 and MASON ontologies. Experiments demonstrate 22% faster convergence, 41.3% model divergence reduction, and constraint violation thresholds where rho<0.05 maintains 90% optimal performance while rho>0.18 causes catastrophic failure. Our theoretical predictions match empirical observations with R^2>0.90 across convergence, privacy, and violation-performance relationships.

Abstract: Thrombosis in rotary blood pumps arises from complex flow conditions that remain difficult to translate into reliable and interpretable risk predictions using existing computational models. This limitation reflects an incomplete understanding of how specific flow features contribute to thrombus initiation and growth. This study introduces an interpretable machine learning framework for spatial thrombosis assessment based directly on computational fluid dynamics-derived flow features. A logistic regression (LR) model combined with a structured feature-selection pipeline is used to derive a compact and physically interpretable feature set, including nonlinear feature combinations. The framework is trained using spatial risk patterns from a validated, macro-scale thrombosis model for two representative scenarios. The model reproduces the labeled risk distributions and identifies distinct sets of flow features associated with increased thrombosis risk. When applied to a centrifugal pump, despite training on a single axial pump operating point, the model predicts plausible thrombosis-prone regions. These results show that interpretable machine learning can link local flow features to thrombosis risk while remaining computationally efficient and mechanistically transparent. The low computational cost enables rapid thrombogenicity screening without repeated or costly simulations. The proposed framework complements physics-based thrombosis modeling and provides a methodological basis for integrating interpretable machine learning into CFD-driven thrombosis analysis and device design workflows.

Abstract: Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) poses significant surgical risks, but accurate prediction remains challenging due to patient-specific variability. While test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a promising approach for personalized prediction, the rarity of IOH events often leads to unreliable test-time training. To address this, we propose CSA-TTA, a novel Cross-Sample Augmented Test-Time Adaptation framework that enhances training by incorporating hypotension events from other individuals. Specifically, we first construct a cross-sample bank by segmenting historical data into hypotensive and non-hypotensive samples. Then, we introduce a coarse-to-fine retrieval strategy for building test-time training data: we initially apply K-Shape clustering to identify representative cluster centers and subsequently retrieve the top-K semantically similar samples based on the current patient signal. Additionally, we integrate both self-supervised masked reconstruction and retrospective sequence forecasting signals during training to enhance model adaptability to rapid and subtle intraoperative dynamics. We evaluate the proposed CSA-TTA on both the VitalDB dataset and a real-world in-hospital dataset by integrating it with state-of-the-art time series forecasting models, including TimesFM and UniTS. CSA-TTA consistently enhances performance across settings-for instance, on VitalDB, it improves Recall and F1 scores by +1.33% and +1.13%, respectively, under fine-tuning, and by +7.46% and +5.07% in zero-shot scenarios-demonstrating strong robustness and generalization.

Abstract: Data is a critical asset for training large language models (LLMs), alongside compute resources and skilled workers. While some training data is publicly available, substantial investment is required to generate proprietary datasets, such as human preference annotations or to curate new ones from existing sources. As larger datasets generally yield better model performance, two natural questions arise. First, how can data owners make informed decisions about curation strategies and data sources investment? Second, how can multiple data owners collaboratively pool their resources to train superior models while fairly distributing the benefits? This problem, data valuation, which is not specific to large language models, has been addressed by the machine learning community through the lens of cooperative game theory, with the Shapley value being the prevalent solution concept. However, computing Shapley values is notoriously expensive for data valuation, typically requiring numerous model retrainings, which can become prohibitive for large machine learning models. In this work, we demonstrate that this computational challenge is dramatically simplified for LLMs trained with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). We show how the specific mathematical structure of DPO enables scalable Shapley value computation. We believe this observation unlocks many applications at the intersection of data valuation and large language models.

Abstract: Diffusion Policy (DP) excels in embodied control but suffers from high inference latency and computational cost due to multiple iterative denoising steps. The temporal complexity of embodied tasks demands a dynamic and adaptable computation mode. Static and lossy acceleration methods, such as quantization, fail to handle such dynamic embodied tasks, while speculative decoding offers a lossless and adaptive yet underexplored alternative for DP. However, it is non-trivial to address the following challenges: how to match the base model's denoising quality at lower cost under time-varying task difficulty in embodied settings, and how to dynamically and interactively adjust computation based on task difficulty in such environments. In this paper, we propose Temporal-aware Reinforcement-based Speculative Diffusion Policy (TS-DP), the first framework that enables speculative decoding for DP with temporal adaptivity. First, to handle dynamic environments where task difficulty varies over time, we distill a Transformer-based drafter to imitate the base model and replace its costly denoising calls. Second, an RL-based scheduler further adapts to time-varying task difficulty by adjusting speculative parameters to maintain accuracy while improving efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse embodied environments demonstrate that TS-DP achieves up to 4.17 times faster inference with over 94% accepted drafts, reaching an inference frequency of 25 Hz and enabling real-time diffusion-based control without performance degradation.

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques are essential for visualizing and analyzing high-dimensional biological sequencing data. t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is widely used for this purpose, traditionally employing the Gaussian kernel to compute pairwise similarities. However, the Gaussian kernel's lack of data-dependence and computational overhead limit its scalability and effectiveness for categorical biological sequences. Recent work proposed the isolation kernel as an alternative, yet it may not optimally capture sequence similarities. In this study, we comprehensively evaluate nine different kernel functions for t-SNE applied to molecular sequences, using three embedding methods: One-Hot Encoding, Spike2Vec, and minimizers. Through both subjective visualization and objective metrics (including neighborhood preservation scores), we demonstrate that the cosine similarity kernel in general outperforms other kernels, including Gaussian and isolation kernels, achieving superior runtime efficiency and better preservation of pairwise distances in low-dimensional space. We further validate our findings through extensive classification and clustering experiments across six diverse biological datasets (Spike7k, Host, ShortRead, Rabies, Genome, and Breast Cancer), employing multiple machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics. Our results show that kernel selection significantly impacts not only visualization quality but also downstream analytical tasks, with the cosine similarity kernel providing the most robust performance across different data types and embedding strategies, making it particularly suitable for large-scale biological sequence analysis.

Abstract: To model discrete sequences such as DNA, proteins, and language using diffusion, practitioners must choose between three major methods: diffusion in discrete space, Gaussian diffusion in Euclidean space, or diffusion on the simplex. Despite their shared goal, these models have disparate algorithms, theoretical structures, and tradeoffs: discrete diffusion has the most natural domain, Gaussian diffusion has more mature algorithms, and diffusion on the simplex in principle combines the strengths of the other two but in practice suffers from a numerically unstable stochastic processes. Ideally we could see each of these models as instances of the same underlying framework, and enable practitioners to switch between models for downstream applications. However previous theories have only considered connections in special cases. Here we build a theory unifying all three methods of discrete diffusion as different parameterizations of the same underlying process: the Wright-Fisher population genetics model. In particular, we find simplicial and Gaussian diffusion as two large-population limits. Our theory formally connects the likelihoods and hyperparameters of these models and leverages decades of mathematical genetics literature to unlock stable simplicial diffusion. Finally, we relieve the practitioner of balancing model trade-offs by demonstrating it is possible to train a single model that can perform diffusion in any of these three domains at test time. Our experiments show that Wright-Fisher simplicial diffusion is more stable and outperforms previous simplicial diffusion models on conditional DNA generation. We also show that we can train models on multiple domains at once that are competitive with models trained on any individual domain.

Abstract: Generative models are often deployed to make decisions on behalf of users, such as vision-language models (VLMs) identifying which person in a room is a doctor to help visually impaired individuals. Yet, VLM decisions are influenced by the perceived demographic attributes of people in the input, which can lead to biased outcomes like failing to identify women as doctors. Moreover, when reducing bias leads to performance loss, users may have varying needs for balancing bias mitigation with overall model capabilities, highlighting the demand for methods that enable controllable bias reduction during inference. Activation steering is a popular approach for inference-time controllability that has shown potential in inducing safer behavior in large language models (LLMs). However, we observe that current steering methods struggle to correct biases, where equiprobable outcomes across demographic groups are required. To address this, we propose Direct Steering Optimization (DSO) which uses reinforcement learning to find linear transformations for steering activations, tailored to mitigate bias while maintaining control over model performance. We demonstrate that DSO achieves state-of-the-art trade-off between fairness and capabilities on both VLMs and LLMs, while offering practitioners inference-time control over the trade-off. Overall, our work highlights the benefit of designing steering strategies that are directly optimized to control model behavior, providing more effective bias intervention than methods that rely on pre-defined heuristics for controllability.

Abstract: Accurate taxonomic classification from DNA barcodes is a cornerstone of global biodiversity monitoring, yet fungi present extreme challenges due to sparse labelling and long-tailed taxa distributions. Conventional supervised learning methods often falter in this domain, struggling to generalize to unseen species and to capture the hierarchical nature of the data. To address these limitations, we introduce BarcodeMamba+, a foundation model for fungal barcode classification built on a powerful and efficient state-space model architecture. We employ a pretrain and fine-tune paradigm, which utilizes partially labelled data and we demonstrate this is substantially more effective than traditional fully-supervised methods in this data-sparse environment. During fine-tuning, we systematically integrate and evaluate a suite of enhancements--including hierarchical label smoothing, a weighted loss function, and a multi-head output layer from MycoAI--to specifically tackle the challenges of fungal taxonomy. Our experiments show that each of these components yields significant performance gains. On a challenging fungal classification benchmark with distinct taxonomic distribution shifts from the broad training set, our final model outperforms a range of existing methods across all taxonomic levels. Our work provides a powerful new tool for genomics-based biodiversity research and establishes an effective and scalable training paradigm for this challenging domain. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/bioscan-ml/BarcodeMamba.

Abstract: There has been significant recent interest in understanding the capacity of Transformers for in-context learning (ICL), yet most theory focuses on supervised settings with explicitly labeled pairs. In practice, Transformers often perform well even when labels are sparse or absent, suggesting crucial structure within unlabeled contextual demonstrations. We introduce and study in-context semi-supervised learning (IC-SSL), where a small set of labeled examples is accompanied by many unlabeled points, and show that Transformers can leverage the unlabeled context to learn a robust, context-dependent representation. This representation enables accurate predictions and markedly improves performance in low-label regimes, offering foundational insights into how Transformers exploit unlabeled context for representation learning within the ICL framework.

Abstract: Deep neural networks achieve impressive performance but remain difficult to interpret and control. We present SALVE (Sparse Autoencoder-Latent Vector Editing), a unified "discover, validate, and control" framework that bridges mechanistic interpretability and model editing. Using an $\ell_1$-regularized autoencoder, we learn a sparse, model-native feature basis without supervision. We validate these features with Grad-FAM, a feature-level saliency mapping method that visually grounds latent features in input data. Leveraging the autoencoder's structure, we perform precise and permanent weight-space interventions, enabling continuous modulation of both class-defining and cross-class features. We further derive a critical suppression threshold, $α_{crit}$, quantifying each class's reliance on its dominant feature, supporting fine-grained robustness diagnostics. Our approach is validated on both convolutional (ResNet-18) and transformer-based (ViT-B/16) models, demonstrating consistent, interpretable control over their behavior. This work contributes a principled methodology for turning feature discovery into actionable model edits, advancing the development of transparent and controllable AI systems.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel, cost-effective, and scalable approach to track numerous assets distributed in forested environments using commodity Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) targeting wildfire response applications. Commodity RFID systems suffer from poor tag localization when dispersed in forested environments due to signal attenuation, multi-path effects and environmental variability. Current methods to address this issue via fingerprinting rely on dispersing tags at known locations {\em a priori}. In this paper, we address the case when it is not possible to tag known locations and show that it is possible to localize tags to accuracies comparable to global positioning systems (GPS) without such a constraint. For this, we propose Gaussian Process to model various environments solely based on RF signal response signatures and without the aid of additional sensors such as global positioning GPS or cameras, and match an unknown RF to the closest match in a model dictionary. We utilize a new weighted log-likelihood method to associate an unknown environment with the closest environment in a dictionary of previously modeled environments, which is a crucial step in being able to use our approach. Our results show that it is possible to achieve localization accuracies of the order of GPS, but with passive commodity RFID, which will allow the tracking of dozens of wildfire assets within the vicinity of mobile readers at-a-time simultaneously, does not require known positions to be tagged {\em a priori}, and can achieve localization at a fraction of the cost compared to GPS.

Abstract: We propose Dynamic Rank Reinforcement Learning (DR-RL), a novel framework that adaptively optimizes the low-rank factorization of Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) in Large Language Models (LLMs) through the integration of reinforcement learning and online matrix perturbation theory. While traditional low-rank approximations often rely on static rank assumptions--limiting their flexibility across diverse input contexts--our method dynamically selects ranks based on real-time sequence dynamics, layer-specific sensitivities, and hardware constraints. The core innovation lies in an RL agent that formulates rank selection as a sequential policy optimization problem, where the reward function strictly balances attention fidelity against computational latency. Crucially, we employ online matrix perturbation bounds to enable incremental rank updates, thereby avoiding the prohibitive cost of full decomposition during inference. Furthermore, the integration of a lightweight Transformer-based policy network and batched Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) operations ensures scalable deployment on modern GPU architectures. Experiments demonstrate that DR-RL maintains downstream accuracy statistically equivalent to full-rank attention while significantly reducing Floating Point Operations (FLOPs), particularly in long-sequence regimes (L > 4096). This work bridges the gap between adaptive efficiency and theoretical rigor in MHSA, offering a principled, mathematically grounded alternative to heuristic rank reduction techniques in resource-constrained deep learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的复杂机器学习模型通常通过线性表示编码特征，但特征以叠加形式存在难以恢复。特别是在过完备机制下（特征数量大于维度），现有算法面临严峻挑战，需要更通用的方法学习任意叠加的隐藏特征方向。

Method: 算法通过对噪声oracle访问进行傅立叶空间搜索，迭代细化搜索空间来定位隐藏的$v_i$方向。核心创新是支持广泛叠加（仅要求$v_i, v_j$不接近相同）和一般响应函数$σ_i$。

Result: 主要成果是高效的查询算法，从对$f$的噪声访问中成功识别所有非退化响应的特征方向并重建函数。算法在比之前相关研究更一般的设置下有效工作。

Conclusion: 该研究突破了过完备机制下特征学习的限制，为从叠加表示中有效恢复隐藏特征方向提供了更通用的理论方法框架。

Abstract: It is widely believed that complex machine learning models generally encode features through linear representations, but these features exist in superposition, making them challenging to recover. We study the following fundamental setting for learning features in superposition from black-box query access: we are given query access to a function \[ f(x)=\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\,σ_i(v_i^\top x), \] where each unit vector $v_i$ encodes a feature direction and $σ_i:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is an arbitrary response function and our goal is to recover the $v_i$ and the function $f$.
  In learning-theoretic terms, superposition refers to the overcomplete regime, when the number of features is larger than the underlying dimension (i.e. $n > d$), which has proven especially challenging for typical algorithmic approaches. Our main result is an efficient query algorithm that, from noisy oracle access to $f$, identifies all feature directions whose responses are non-degenerate and reconstructs the function $f$. Crucially, our algorithm works in a significantly more general setting than all related prior results -- we allow for essentially arbitrary superpositions, only requiring that $v_i, v_j$ are not nearly identical for $i \neq j$, and general response functions $σ_i$. At a high level, our algorithm introduces an approach for searching in Fourier space by iteratively refining the search space to locate the hidden directions $v_i$.

Abstract: Solving complex partial differential equations is vital in the physical sciences, but often requires computationally expensive numerical methods. Reduced-order models (ROMs) address this by exploiting dimensionality reduction to create fast approximations. While modern ROMs can solve parameterized families of PDEs, their predictive power degrades over long time horizons. We address this by (1) introducing a flexible, high-order, yet inexpensive finite-difference scheme and (2) proposing a Rollout loss that trains ROMs to make accurate predictions over arbitrary time horizons. We demonstrate our approach on the 2D Burgers equation.

Abstract: Accurate and cost-effective quantification of the agroecosystem carbon cycle at decision-relevant scales is essential for climate mitigation and sustainable agriculture. However, both transfer learning and the exploitation of spatial variability in this field are challenging, as they involve heterogeneous data and complex cross-scale dependencies. Conventional approaches often rely on location-independent parameterizations and independent training, underutilizing transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity in the inputs, and limiting their applicability in regions with substantial variability. We propose FTBSC-KGML (Fine-Tuning-Based Site Calibration-Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning), a pretraining- and fine-tuning-based, spatial-variability-aware, and knowledge-guided machine learning framework that augments KGML-ag with a pretraining-fine-tuning process and site-specific parameters. Using a pretraining-fine-tuning process with remote-sensing GPP, climate, and soil covariates collected across multiple midwestern sites, FTBSC-KGML estimates land emissions while leveraging transfer learning and spatial heterogeneity. A key component is a spatial-heterogeneity-aware transfer-learning scheme, which is a globally pretrained model that is fine-tuned at each state or site to learn place-aware representations, thereby improving local accuracy under limited data without sacrificing interpretability. Empirically, FTBSC-KGML achieves lower validation error and greater consistency in explanatory power than a purely global model, thereby better capturing spatial variability across states. This work extends the prior SDSA-KGML framework.

Abstract: Big Data has become central to modern applications in finance, insurance, and cybersecurity, enabling machine learning systems to perform large-scale risk assessments and fraud detection. However, the increasing dependence on automated analytics introduces important concerns about transparency, regulatory compliance, and trust. This paper examines how explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) can be integrated into Big Data analytics pipelines for fraud detection and risk management. We review key Big Data characteristics and survey major analytical tools, including distributed storage systems, streaming platforms, and advanced fraud detection models such as anomaly detectors, graph-based approaches, and ensemble classifiers. We also present a structured review of widely used XAI methods, including LIME, SHAP, counterfactual explanations, and attention mechanisms, and analyze their strengths and limitations when deployed at scale. Based on these findings, we identify key research gaps related to scalability, real-time processing, and explainability for graph and temporal models. To address these challenges, we outline a conceptual framework that integrates scalable Big Data infrastructure with context-aware explanation mechanisms and human feedback. The paper concludes with open research directions in scalable XAI, privacy-aware explanations, and standardized evaluation methods for explainable fraud detection systems.

TL;DR: 提出CauStream框架解决径流预测中传统深度学习缺乏物理可解释性与固定因果图不适应数据的问题，通过联合学习径流因果图与站点间动态路由图，实现可解释且适应性强的预测。


<details>

Motivation: 当前深度学习模型在径流预测中忽略物理过程导致可解释性与泛化性受限，现有因果方法依赖固定因果图无法适应数据动态变化，需发展能够灵活学习因果结构的统一框架。

Method: 设计CauStream框架，联合学习两个因果图：(1)气象强迫与径流间的径流因果图，(2)站点间动态依赖的路由图；在非参数设定下建立因果结构的可识别性条件。

Result: 在三个美国主要流域的三种预测时间尺度上评估，CauStream始终优于现有方法，尤其在长期预测窗口差距更显著；学习到的因果结构与水文领域知识高度一致，提供流域动态的可解释见解。

Conclusion: CauStream为因果时空建模提供理论基础，可扩展到广泛科学与环境应用；在保持高性能的同时通过可解释因果结构增强模型可信度与适应性。

Abstract: Streamflow forecasting is crucial for water resource management and risk mitigation. While deep learning models have achieved strong predictive performance, they often overlook underlying physical processes, limiting interpretability and generalization. Recent causal learning approaches address these issues by integrating domain knowledge, yet they typically rely on fixed causal graphs that fail to adapt to data. We propose CauStream, a unified framework for causal spatiotemporal streamflow forecasting. CauSTream jointly learns (i) a runoff causal graph among meteorological forcings and (ii) a routing graph capturing dynamic dependencies across stations. We further establish identifiability conditions for these causal structures under a nonparametric setting. We evaluate CauSTream on three major U.S. river basins across three forecasting horizons. The model consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, with performance gaps widening at longer forecast windows, indicating stronger generalization to unseen conditions. Beyond forecasting, CauSTream also learns causal graphs that capture relationships among hydrological factors and stations. The inferred structures align closely with established domain knowledge, offering interpretable insights into watershed dynamics. CauSTream offers a principled foundation for causal spatiotemporal modeling, with the potential to extend to a wide range of scientific and environmental applications.

Motivation: 探索非自回归、非注意力机制的神经架构（DeepOSets）在科学机器学习中的上下文学习能力，特别是对于偏微分方程解算子的泛化学习

Method: 将DeepSets的集合学习与DeepONets的算子学习相结合，对DeepOSets架构进行适当修改，使其能够通过用户提示中的参数-解示例对来学习新PDE的解算子，无需权重更新

Result: DeepOSets被证明是连续算子类的通用均匀逼近器，这是科学机器学习领域的首次结果。实验表明，该模型能在Poisson方程和反应-扩散方程的正反边值问题中，利用上下文示例准确预测训练中未见过的PDE的解

Conclusion: DeepOSets架构具有强大的基于上下文学习的多算子学习能力，能够从示例中学习新的PDE解算子，无需额外训练，为科学机器学习提供了新的通用逼近理论框架

Abstract: In-context Learning (ICL) is the remarkable capability displayed by some machine learning models to learn from examples in a prompt, without any further weight updates. ICL had originally been thought to emerge from the self-attention mechanism in autoregressive transformer architectures. DeepOSets is a non-autoregressive, non-attention based neural architecture that combines set learning via the DeepSets architecture with operator learning via Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets). In a previous study, DeepOSets was shown to display ICL capabilities in supervised learning problems. In this paper, we show that the DeepOSets architecture, with the appropriate modifications, is a multi-operator in-context learner that can recover the solution operator of a new PDE, not seen during training, from example pairs of parameter and solution placed in a user prompt, without any weight updates. Furthermore, we show that DeepOSets is a universal uniform approximator over a class of continuous operators, which we believe is the first result of its kind in the literature of scientific machine learning. This means that a single DeepOSets architecture exists that approximates in-context any continuous operator in the class to any fixed desired degree accuracy, given an appropriate number of examples in the prompt. Experiments with Poisson and reaction-diffusion forward and inverse boundary-value problems demonstrate the ability of the proposed model to use in-context examples to predict accurately the solutions corresponding to parameter queries for PDEs not seen during training.

Motivation: 图像数据常包含人脸、车牌等隐私信息，现有高斯模糊方法在实际低精度实现中容易被逆向攻击，需要更可靠的隐私保护方案

Method: 对比分析四种去标识化算法（高斯模糊、像素化、DP-Pix、裁剪），通过逆向攻击、识别攻击评估隐私性，通过模型训练质量评估数据效用

Result: 发现高斯模糊在实际应用中隐私性最差，而适当精度的像素化及像素化+噪声方法能在多种计算机视觉任务中兼顾隐私和效用

Conclusion: 现有高斯模糊标准方法隐私保护不足，像素化及像素化+噪声是更好的替代方案，已开发Privacy Blur软件包供实际使用

Abstract: Image data collected in the wild often contains private information such as faces and license plates, and responsible data release must ensure that this information stays hidden. At the same time, released data should retain its usefulness for model-training. The standard method for private information obfuscation in images is Gaussian blurring. In this work, we show that practical implementations of Gaussian blurring are reversible enough to break privacy. We then take a closer look at the privacy-utility tradeoffs offered by three other obfuscation algorithms -- pixelization, pixelization and noise addition (DP-Pix), and cropping. Privacy is evaluated by reversal and discrimination attacks, while utility by the quality of the learnt representations when the model is trained on data with obfuscated faces. We show that the most popular industry-standard method, Gaussian blur is the least private of the four -- being susceptible to reversal attacks in its practical low-precision implementations. In contrast, pixelization and pixelization plus noise addition, when used at the right level of granularity, offer both privacy and utility for a number of computer vision tasks. We make our proposed methods together with suggested parameters available in a software package called Privacy Blur.

Abstract: Market manipulation now routinely originates from coordinated social media campaigns, not isolated trades. Retail investors, regulators, and brokerages need tools that connect online narratives and coordination patterns to market behavior. We present AIMM, an AI-driven framework that fuses Reddit activity, bot and coordination indicators, and OHLCV market features into a daily AIMM Manipulation Risk Score for each ticker.
  The system uses a parquet-native pipeline with a Streamlit dashboard that allows analysts to explore suspicious windows, inspect underlying posts and price action, and log model outputs over time. Due to Reddit API restrictions, we employ calibrated synthetic social features matching documented event characteristics; market data (OHLCV) uses real historical data from Yahoo Finance. This release makes three contributions. First, we build the AIMM Ground Truth dataset (AIMM-GT): 33 labeled ticker-days spanning eight equities, drawing from SEC enforcement actions, community-verified manipulation cases, and matched normal controls. Second, we implement forward-walk evaluation and prospective prediction logging for both retrospective and deployment-style assessment. Third, we analyze lead times and show that AIMM flagged GME 22 days before the January 2021 squeeze peak.
  The current labeled set is small (33 ticker-days, 3 positive events), but results show preliminary discriminative capability and early warnings for the GME incident. We release the code, dataset schema, and dashboard design to support research on social media-driven market surveillance.

Abstract: Learning the structure of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) from observational data is a central problem in causal discovery, statistical signal processing, and machine learning. Under a linear Gaussian structural equation model (SEM) with equal noise variances, the problem is identifiable and we show that the ensemble precision matrix of the observations exhibits a distinctive structure that facilitates DAG recovery. Exploiting this property, we propose BUILD (Bottom-Up Inference of Linear DAGs), a deterministic stepwise algorithm that identifies leaf nodes and their parents, then prunes the leaves by removing incident edges to proceed to the next step, exactly reconstructing the DAG from the true precision matrix. In practice, precision matrices must be estimated from finite data, and ill-conditioning may lead to error accumulation across BUILD steps. As a mitigation strategy, we periodically re-estimate the precision matrix (with less variables as leaves are pruned), trading off runtime for enhanced robustness. Reproducible results on challenging synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that BUILD compares favorably to state-of-the-art DAG learning algorithms, while offering an explicit handle on complexity.

Abstract: Machine unlearning is a newly popularized technique for removing specific training data from a trained model, enabling it to comply with data deletion requests. While it protects the rights of users requesting unlearning, it also introduces new privacy risks. Prior works have primarily focused on the privacy of data that has been unlearned, while the risks to retained data remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we focus on the privacy risks of retained data and, for the first time, reveal the vulnerabilities introduced by machine unlearning under the dual-view setting, where an adversary can query both the original and the unlearned models. From an information-theoretic perspective, we introduce the concept of {privacy knowledge gain} and demonstrate that the dual-view setting allows adversaries to obtain more information than querying either model alone, thereby amplifying privacy leakage. To effectively demonstrate this threat, we propose DVIA, a Dual-View Inference Attack, which extracts membership information on retained data using black-box queries to both models. DVIA eliminates the need to train an attack model and employs a lightweight likelihood ratio inference module for efficient inference. Experiments across different datasets and model architectures validate the effectiveness of DVIA and highlight the privacy risks inherent in the dual-view setting.

Motivation: 尽管基于排序的零阶优化方法在演化计算等领域应用广泛（如CMA-ES、自然演化策略等），但其理论分析一直停留在渐进层面，缺乏显式的收敛速率和查询复杂度界。现有分析无法为选择top-k方向的算法提供明确的理论保证。

Conclusion: 首次为基于排序的零阶优化提供了显式的非渐进收敛率分析，揭示了基于排序的启发式方法能够实现高效零阶优化的理论原因。

Abstract: Rank-based zeroth-order (ZO) optimization -- which relies only on the ordering of function evaluations -- offers strong robustness to noise and monotone transformations, and underlies many successful algorithms such as CMA-ES, natural evolution strategies, and rank-based genetic algorithms. Despite its widespread use, the theoretical understanding of rank-based ZO methods remains limited: existing analyses provide only asymptotic insights and do not yield explicit convergence rates for algorithms selecting the top-$k$ directions.
  This work closes this gap by analyzing a simple rank-based ZO algorithm and establishing the first \emph{explicit}, and \emph{non-asymptotic} query complexities. For a $d$-dimension problem, if the function is $L$-smooth and $μ$-strongly convex, the algorithm achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal O}\!\left(\frac{dL}μ\log\!\frac{dL}{μδ}\log\!\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)$ to find an $\varepsilon$-suboptimal solution, and for smooth nonconvex objectives it reaches $\mathcal O\!\left(\frac{dL}{\varepsilon}\log\!\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)$. Notation $\cO(\cdot)$ hides constant terms and $\widetilde{\mathcal O}(\cdot)$ hides extra $\log\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon}$ term. These query complexities hold with a probability at least $1-δ$ with $0<δ<1$. The analysis in this paper is novel and avoids classical drift and information-geometric techniques. Our analysis offers new insight into why rank-based heuristics lead to efficient ZO optimization.

Abstract: Developing open-set classification methods capable of classifying in-distribution (ID) data while detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) samples is essential for deploying graph neural networks (GNNs) in open-world scenarios. Existing methods typically treat all OOD samples as a single class, despite real-world applications, especially high-stake settings such as fraud detection and medical diagnosis, demanding deeper insights into OOD samples, including their probable labels. This raises a critical question: can OOD detection be extended to OOD classification without true label information? To address this question, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine open-set Classification (CFC) framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for graph datasets. CFC consists of three key components: a coarse classifier that uses LLM prompts for OOD detection and outlier label generation, a GNN-based fine classifier trained with OOD samples identified by the coarse classifier for enhanced OOD detection and ID classification, and refined OOD classification achieved through LLM prompts and post-processed OOD labels. Unlike methods that rely on synthetic or auxiliary OOD samples, CFC employs semantic OOD instances that are genuinely out-of-distribution based on their inherent meaning, improving interpretability and practical utility. Experimental results show that CFC improves OOD detection by ten percent over state-of-the-art methods on graph and text domains and achieves up to seventy percent accuracy in OOD classification on graph datasets.

Motivation: 联邦图学习面临的主要挑战是客户端间数据分布的异构性问题，现有方法存在两个主要问题：(1)基于经验风险最小化的优化器容易使局部模型陷入尖锐谷地，降低对分布外图数据的泛化能力；(2)局部图数据学习表示中的维度崩塌现象会影响GNN模型的分类能力。

Abstract: One of many impediments to applying graph neural networks (GNNs) to large-scale real-world graph data is the challenge of centralized training, which requires aggregating data from different organizations, raising privacy concerns. Federated graph learning (FGL) addresses this by enabling collaborative GNN model training without sharing private data. However, a core challenge in FGL systems is the variation in local training data distributions among clients, known as the data heterogeneity problem. Most existing solutions suffer from two problems: (1) The typical optimizer based on empirical risk minimization tends to cause local models to fall into sharp valleys and weakens their generalization to out-of-distribution graph data. (2) The prevalent dimensional collapse in the learned representations of local graph data has an adverse impact on the classification capacity of the GNN model. To this end, we formulate a novel optimization objective that is aware of the sharpness (i.e., the curvature of the loss surface) of local GNN models. By minimizing the loss function and its sharpness simultaneously, we seek out model parameters in a flat region with uniformly low loss values, thus improving the generalization over heterogeneous data. By introducing a regularizer based on the correlation matrix of local representations, we relax the correlations of representations generated by individual local graph samples, so as to alleviate the dimensional collapse of the learned model. The proposed \textbf{S}harpness-aware f\textbf{E}derated gr\textbf{A}ph \textbf{L}earning (SEAL) algorithm can enhance the classification accuracy and generalization ability of local GNN models in federated graph learning. Experimental studies on several graph classification benchmarks show that SEAL consistently outperforms SOTA FGL baselines and provides gains for more participants.

Conclusion: SSLF模型通过锐度感知优化有效解决了SLF模型的优化难题，在多个实际应用中展现出优越性能。

Abstract: Second-order Latent Factor (SLF) model, a class of low-rank representation learning methods, has proven effective at extracting node-to-node interaction patterns from High-dimensional and Incomplete (HDI) data. However, its optimization is notoriously difficult due to its bilinear and non-convex nature. Sharpness-aware Minimization (SAM) has recently proposed to find flat local minima when minimizing non-convex objectives, thereby improving the generalization of representation-learning models. To address this challenge, we propose a Sharpness-aware SLF (SSLF) model. SSLF embodies two key ideas: (1) acquiring second-order information via Hessian-vector products; and (2) injecting a sharpness term into the curvature (Hessian) through the designed Hessian-vector products. Experiments on multiple industrial datasets demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Current mainstream post-training quantization methods for large language models typically apply a uniform quantization strategy across all network layers, overlooking the substantial differences in algorithmic suitability among layers. To address this limitation, we propose CKA Guided Modular Quantization, a fine-tuning-free, plug-and-play framework for algorithmic heterogeneous quantization. Our method independently evaluates multiple PTQ algorithms on each layer and employs Linear Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) as a metric to automatically select the optimal quantization strategy per layer. The individually optimized strategies are then integrated to construct a hybrid quantized model. Experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms both uniform quantization baselines and state-of-the-art mixed-precision methods across mainstream LLMs including LLaMA and Qwen ,in terms of perplexity (PPL) and downstream task performance.

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in safety-critical and regulated sectors, the retention of sensitive or prohibited knowledge introduces escalating risks, ranging from privacy leakage to regulatory non-compliance to to potential misuse, and so on. Recent studies suggest that machine unlearning can help ensure deployed models comply with evolving legal, safety, and governance requirements. However, current unlearning techniques assume clean separation between forget and retain datasets, which is challenging in operational settings characterized by highly entangled distributions. In such scenarios, perturbation-based methods often degrade general model utility or fail to ensure safety. To address this, we propose Selective Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (SRMU), a novel principled activation-editing framework that enforces feature-aware and directionally controlled perturbations. Unlike indiscriminate model weights perturbations, SRMU employs a structured misdirection vector with an activation importance map. The goal is to allow SRMU selectively suppresses harmful representations while preserving the utility on benign ones. Experiments are conducted on the widely used WMDP benchmark across low- and high-entanglement configurations. Empirical results reveal that SRMU delivers state-of-the-art unlearning performance with minimal utility losses, and remains effective under 20-30\% overlap where existing baselines collapse. SRMU provides a robust foundation for safety-driven model governance, privacy compliance, and controlled knowledge removal in the emerging LLM-based applications. We release the replication package at https://figshare.com/s/d5931192a8824de26aff.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Tomographic Quantile Forests (TQF): 一种基于树结构的多变量回归模型，通过方向投影条件分位数估计和切片Wasserstein距离优化，无需参数化即可估计多变量条件分布


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实AI部署需要可靠的概率预测不确定性量化，但多变量目标的完全非参数条件分布估计仍具挑战性。现有方向分位数方法通常只能生成凸分位数区域，且需为不同方向训练独立模型

Method: TQF学习方向投影n⊤y的条件分位数作为输入x和单位方向n的函数。推理时聚合多个方向的分位数，通过有效交替优化方案（含凸子问题）最小化切片Wasserstein距离来重建多变量条件分布，单个模型覆盖所有方向且不施加凸性限制

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上评估TQF性能，源代码已在GitHub发布

Conclusion: TQF为非参数、不确定性感知的多变量目标树回归模型，解决了方向分位数方法的局限性，能更灵活地估计多变量条件分布

Abstract: Quantifying predictive uncertainty is essential for safe and trustworthy real-world AI deployment. Yet, fully nonparametric estimation of conditional distributions remains challenging for multivariate targets. We propose Tomographic Quantile Forests (TQF), a nonparametric, uncertainty-aware, tree-based regression model for multivariate targets. TQF learns conditional quantiles of directional projections $\mathbf{n}^{\top}\mathbf{y}$ as functions of the input $\mathbf{x}$ and the unit direction $\mathbf{n}$. At inference, it aggregates quantiles across many directions and reconstructs the multivariate conditional distribution by minimizing the sliced Wasserstein distance via an efficient alternating scheme with convex subproblems. Unlike classical directional-quantile approaches that typically produce only convex quantile regions and require training separate models for different directions, TQF covers all directions with a single model without imposing convexity restrictions. We evaluate TQF on synthetic and real-world datasets, and release the source code on GitHub.

Abstract: This work focuses on quantitative verification of fairness in tree ensembles. Unlike traditional verification approaches that merely return a single counterexample when the fairness is violated, quantitative verification estimates the ratio of all counterexamples and characterizes the regions where they occur, which is important information for diagnosing and mitigating bias. To date, quantitative verification has been explored almost exclusively for deep neural networks (DNNs). Representative methods, such as DeepGemini and FairQuant, all build on the core idea of Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement, a generic framework that could be adapted to other model classes. We extended the framework into a model-agnostic form, but discovered two limitations: (i) it can provide only lower bounds, and (ii) its performance scales poorly. Exploiting the discrete structure of tree ensembles, our work proposes an efficient quantification technique that delivers any-time upper and lower bounds. Experiments on five widely used datasets demonstrate its effectiveness and efficiency. When applied to fairness testing, our quantification method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art testing techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kascade 是一种无需训练的稀疏注意力方法，通过选择性重用高层级的关键索引来加速长上下文LLM推理，在保证精度的同时获得显著的速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 注意力机制是长上下文LLM推理延迟的主要来源，现有方法需要权衡稀疏注意力带来的精度损失。

Method: 利用注意力固有的稀疏性和关键索引在相邻层间的稳定性，在少量锚定层计算精确Top-k索引，然后在中间重用层复用这些索引。通过动态规划优化锚定层选择，实现跨模型的轻松部署，并支持head-aware的Top-k选择和高效实现。

Result: 在H100 GPU上，Kascade相比FlashAttention-3基线实现了高达4.1倍的解码注意力加速和2.2倍的预填充注意力加速，在LongBench和AIME-24等长上下文基准测试中保持了与密集注意力相近的精度。

Conclusion: Kascade 是一种高效且精确的稀疏注意力方法，能够显著加速长上下文LLM推理，同时保持模型性能，适用于各种实际部署场景。

Abstract: Attention is the dominant source of latency during long-context LLM inference, an increasingly popular workload with reasoning models and RAG. We propose Kascade, a training-free sparse attention method that leverages known observations such as 1) post-softmax attention is intrinsically sparse, and 2) the identity of high-weight keys is stable across nearby layers. Kascade computes exact Top-k indices in a small set of anchor layers, then reuses those indices in intermediate reuse layers. The anchor layers are selected algorithmically, via a dynamic-programming objective that maximizes cross-layer similarity over a development set, allowing easy deployment across models. The method incorporates efficient implementation constraints (e.g. tile-level operations), across both prefill and decode attention. The Top-k selection and reuse in Kascade is head-aware and we show in our experiments that this is critical for high accuracy. Kascade achieves up to 4.1x speedup in decode attention and 2.2x speedup in prefill attention over FlashAttention-3 baseline on H100 GPUs while closely matching dense attention accuracy on long-context benchmarks such as LongBench and AIME-24.

TL;DR: 该论文针对多智能体系统在金融预测任务中存在的公平性风险，提出了系统性的评估方法，通过大规模模拟揭示了集体行为导致的偏见模式，并强调需要将多智能体系统作为整体进行评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏有效的评估方法，多智能体系统在高风险金融领域（如消费金融）部署时存在公平性风险，可能导致监管违规和财务损失，因此需要开发针对多智能体预测系统的公平性评估方法。

Method: 通过大规模模拟实验，考察不同多智能体配置（包括不同的通信和协作机制）下的公平性指标，分析金融决策中出现的偏见模式。

Result: 研究发现多智能体系统可能出现无法追溯到单个智能体组件的集体偏见行为，表明这类系统可能表现出真正的集体行为。公平性风险是金融多智能体系统模型风险的重要组成部分，对信用评分和收入估计等任务有实际影响。

Conclusion: 多智能体决策系统必须作为整体进行评估，而非通过对构成组件的还原主义分析。这表明需要新的评估方法来识别和管理多智能体系统中的公平性风险。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems have demonstrated the ability to improve performance on a variety of predictive tasks by leveraging collaborative decision making. However, the lack of effective evaluation methodologies has made it difficult to estimate the risk of bias, making deployment of such systems unsafe in high stakes domains such as consumer finance, where biased decisions can translate directly into regulatory breaches and financial loss. To address this challenge, we need to develop fairness evaluation methodologies for multi-agent predictive systems and measure the fairness characteristics of these systems in the financial tabular domain. Examining fairness metrics using large-scale simulations across diverse multi-agent configurations, with varying communication and collaboration mechanisms, we reveal patterns of emergent bias in financial decision-making that cannot be traced to individual agent components, indicating that multi-agent systems may exhibit genuinely collective behaviors. Our findings highlight that fairness risks in financial multi-agent systems represent a significant component of model risk, with tangible impacts on tasks such as credit scoring and income estimation. We advocate that multi-agent decision systems must be evaluated as holistic entities rather than through reductionist analyses of their constituent components.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology for detecting faults in wind turbine blades using com-putational learning techniques. The study evaluates two models: the first employs logistic regression, which outperformed neural networks, decision trees, and the naive Bayes method, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying fault-related patterns. The second model leverages clustering and achieves superior performance in terms of precision and data segmentation. The results indicate that clustering may better capture the underlying data characteristics compared to supervised methods. The proposed methodology offers a new approach to early fault detection in wind turbine blades, highlighting the potential of integrating different computational learning techniques to enhance system reliability. The use of accessible tools like Orange Data Mining underscores the practical application of these advanced solutions within the wind energy sector. Future work will focus on combining these methods to improve detection accuracy further and extend the application of these techniques to other critical components in energy infrastructure.

TL;DR: 比较四种黑盒优化算法为LDA选最优主题数，发现摊销优化器（SABBO/PABBO）比手工演化方法（GA/ES）样本和时间效率高得多。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LDA中主题数T的选择对统计拟合和可解释性至关重要，但现有方法通常依赖网格搜索或启发式规则，缺乏系统性优化。

Method: 将主题数选择建模为离散黑盒优化问题，比较四类优化器：遗传算法(GA)、演化策略(ES)、偏好摊销黑盒优化(PABBO)和锐度感知黑盒优化(SABBO)，在有限评估预算下通过验证困惑度评估每个候选T。

Result: 所有方法最终达到相似的困惑度区域，但摊销优化器SABBO仅需约1次评估就能找到近优主题数，PABBO在几次评估内找到竞争性配置，而GA/ES需要几乎用完预算才能接近相同区域。

Conclusion: 摊销黑盒优化方法在样本和时间效率上显著优于传统演化算法，为LDA主题数选择提供了高效自动化方案。

Abstract: Choosing the number of topics $T$ in Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a key design decision that strongly affects both the statistical fit and interpretability of topic models. In this work, we formulate the selection of $T$ as a discrete black-box optimization problem, where each function evaluation corresponds to training an LDA model and measuring its validation perplexity. Under a fixed evaluation budget, we compare four families of optimizers: two hand-designed evolutionary methods - Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Evolution Strategy (ES) - and two learned, amortized approaches, Preferential Amortized Black-Box Optimization (PABBO) and Sharpness-Aware Black-Box Optimization (SABBO). Our experiments show that, while GA, ES, PABBO, and SABBO eventually reach a similar band of final perplexity, the amortized optimizers are substantially more sample- and time-efficient. SABBO typically identifies a near-optimal topic number after essentially a single evaluation, and PABBO finds competitive configurations within a few evaluations, whereas GA and ES require almost the full budget to approach the same region.

TL;DR: 提出PLSCAN密度聚类算法，能自动识别所有最小簇大小，在真实数据集上比HDBSCAN*有更高ARI且对参数变化更不敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密度聚类在EDA中很重要，但现有方法(如DBSCAN、HDBSCAN*)需要手动选择超参数(密度阈值或最小簇大小)，这在没有先验知识时很困难。

Method: 提出PLSCAN算法：1) 高效识别HDBSCAN*产生稳定叶簇的所有最小簇大小；2) 应用尺度空间聚类原理；3) 等价于新度量空间上的持续同调分析。

Result: 1) 在多个真实数据集上比HDBSCAN*获得更高的平均ARI；2) 对互达邻居数量变化更不敏感；3) 低维数据集上计算成本与k-Means相当，高维时与HDBSCAN*相似。

Conclusion: PLSCAN是一种新颖的密度聚类算法，能自动确定合适的聚类参数，在保持竞争性计算效率的同时提供更好的聚类性能。

Abstract: Clustering is a cornerstone of modern data analysis. Detecting clusters in exploratory data analyses (EDA) requires algorithms that make few assumptions about the data. Density-based clustering algorithms are particularly well-suited for EDA because they describe high-density regions, assuming only that a density exists. Applying density-based clustering algorithms in practice, however, requires selecting appropriate hyperparameters, which is difficult without prior knowledge of the data distribution. For example, DBSCAN requires selecting a density threshold, and HDBSCAN* relies on a minimum cluster size parameter. In this work, we propose Persistent Leaves Spatial Clustering for Applications with Noise (PLSCAN). This novel density-based clustering algorithm efficiently identifies all minimum cluster sizes for which HDBSCAN* produces stable (leaf) clusters. PLSCAN applies scale-space clustering principles and is equivalent to persistent homology on a novel metric space. We compare its performance to HDBSCAN* on several real-world datasets, demonstrating that it achieves a higher average ARI and is less sensitive to changes in the number of mutual reachability neighbours. Additionally, we compare PLSCAN's computational costs to k-Means, demonstrating competitive run-times on low-dimensional datasets. At higher dimensions, run times scale more similarly to HDBSCAN*.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出Abacus预训练方法，用自监督学习预测用户事件的经验频率分布，结合顺序学习目标，改善展示广告中的用户购买行为建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 展示广告系统中用户购买行为建模因正面事件稀疏、用户行为随机性导致类别不平衡和事件时间不规则。现有方法依赖手工设计的计数特征，忽略了用户意图的细粒度时间演化，而当前顺序模型又缺失有用的事件计数统计信息。

Method: 提出Abacus自监督预训练方法，预测用户事件的经验频率分布。进一步设计混合目标，将Abacus与顺序学习目标统一，结合聚合统计的稳定性和顺序建模的敏感性。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的实验表明，Abacus预训练优于现有方法，加速下游任务收敛，混合方法相比基线将AUC提升高达+6.1%。

Conclusion: Abacus自监督预训练方法能有效提升展示广告中的用户行为建模性能，混合方法结合了频率统计和顺序建模的优势，显著改善预测准确性。

Abstract: Modeling user purchase behavior is a critical challenge in display advertising systems, necessary for real-time bidding. The difficulty arises from the sparsity of positive user events and the stochasticity of user actions, leading to severe class imbalance and irregular event timing. Predictive systems usually rely on hand-crafted "counter" features, overlooking the fine-grained temporal evolution of user intent. Meanwhile, current sequential models extract direct sequential signal, missing useful event-counting statistics. We enhance deep sequential models with self-supervised pretraining strategies for display advertising. Especially, we introduce Abacus, a novel approach of predicting the empirical frequency distribution of user events. We further propose a hybrid objective unifying Abacus with sequential learning objectives, combining stability of aggregated statistics with the sequence modeling sensitivity. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that Abacus pretraining outperforms existing methods accelerating downstream task convergence, while hybrid approach yields up to +6.1% AUC compared to the baselines.

TL;DR: 本文研究了源数据无关的跨接收器射频指纹识别（SCRFFI）问题，提出了一种新的MS-SHOT方法来解决当模型从一个源接收器迁移到目标接收器时，因硬件差异导致的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着边缘计算的快速发展，基于深度学习的射频指纹识别在设备安全认证中变得越来越重要。但实际部署中面临一个关键挑战：当模型应用于不同硬件特性的接收器时，由于硬件差异引起的分布偏移会导致性能显著下降。现有的方法在目标域存在标签偏移或未知的非均匀类分布时表现不佳。

Method: 作者首先构建了一个基于约束伪标签的SCRFFI适应框架，并对其泛化性能进行了理论分析。在此分析基础上，提出了MS-SHOT方法，该方法结合了动量中心引导的软伪标签技术，并通过全局结构约束来鼓励自信且多样化的预测。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的大量实验表明，MS-SHOT方法在准确性和鲁棒性方面均优于现有方法，特别是在目标域存在标签偏移或未知的非均匀类分布时表现优异。

Conclusion: MS-SHOT为射频指纹识别中的源数据无关跨接收器适应提供了一个实用且可扩展的解决方案，能够有效解决实际部署中的硬件差异挑战。

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of edge computing, Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI) has become increasingly important for secure device authentication. However, practical deployment of deep learning-based RFFI models is hindered by a critical challenge: their performance often degrades significantly when applied across receivers with different hardware characteristics due to distribution shifts introduced by receiver variation. To address this, we investigate the source-data-free cross-receiver RFFI (SCRFFI) problem, where a model pretrained on labeled signals from a source receiver must adapt to unlabeled signals from a target receiver, without access to any source-domain data during adaptation. We first formulate a novel constrained pseudo-labeling-based SCRFFI adaptation framework, and provide a theoretical analysis of its generalization performance. Our analysis highlights a key insight: the target-domain performance is highly sensitive to the quality of the pseudo-labels generated during adaptation. Motivated by this, we propose Momentum Soft pseudo-label Source Hypothesis Transfer (MS-SHOT), a new method for SCRFFI that incorporates momentum-center-guided soft pseudo-labeling and enforces global structural constraints to encourage confident and diverse predictions. Notably, MS-SHOT effectively addresses scenarios involving label shift or unknown, non-uniform class distributions in the target domain -- a significant limitation of prior methods. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MS-SHOT consistently outperforms existing approaches in both accuracy and robustness, offering a practical and scalable solution for source-data-free cross-receiver adaptation in RFFI.

Abstract: Text classification problems, such as gender classification from a blog, have been a well-matured research area that has been well studied using machine learning algorithms. It has several application domains in market analysis, customer recommendation, and recommendation systems. This study presents a comparative analysis of the widely used machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), AdaBoost, XGBoost, and an SVM variant (SVM_R) with neuro-symbolic AI (NeSy). The paper also explores the effect of text representations such as TF-IDF, the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE), and RoBERTa. Additionally, various feature extraction techniques, including Chi-Square, Mutual Information, and Principal Component Analysis, are explored. Building on these, we introduce a comparative analysis of the machine learning and deep learning approaches in comparison to the NeSy. The experimental results show that the use of the NeSy approach matched strong MLP results despite a limited dataset. Future work on this research will expand the knowledge base, the scope of embedding types, and the hyperparameter configuration to further study the effectiveness of the NeSy approach.

TL;DR: CLARiTy是一个基于ViT的模型，用于胸部X光的多标签分类和弱监督定位，通过类特定token和SegmentCAM模块提升性能，在NIH ChestX-ray14数据集上达到SOTA水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胸部X光片的解读在准确进行多标签病理分类和空间定位方面存在挑战，这些问题需要不同粒度的标注，但常受限于区域级（密集）标注的稀缺性。

Method: CLARiTy采用基于视觉Transformer的架构，使用多个类特定token生成判别性注意力图，并通过SegmentCAM模块结合解剖学先验进行前景分割和背景抑制，利用ConvNeXtV2教师模型进行蒸馏以提高效率。

Result: 在NIH ChestX-ray14数据集上，CLARiTy-S-16-512在14种病理分类中取得竞争性表现，在8种病理的弱监督定位任务中SOTA，比先前方法提升50.7%；低分辨率变体CLARiTy-S-16-224在保持高效率的同时显著超越基线模型。

Conclusion: CLARiTy通过利用ViT自注意力获取全局上下文和类特定定位，并结合卷积背景抑制来生成精确、降噪的热力图，超越了CNN-ViT混合架构，具有在资源有限环境中应用的潜力。

Abstract: The interpretation of chest X-rays (CXRs) poses significant challenges, particularly in achieving accurate multi-label pathology classification and spatial localization. These tasks demand different levels of annotation granularity but are frequently constrained by the scarcity of region-level (dense) annotations. We introduce CLARiTy (Class Localizing and Attention Refining Image Transformer), a vision transformer-based model for joint multi-label classification and weakly-supervised localization of thoracic pathologies. CLARiTy employs multiple class-specific tokens to generate discriminative attention maps, and a SegmentCAM module for foreground segmentation and background suppression using explicit anatomical priors. Trained on image-level labels from the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset, it leverages distillation from a ConvNeXtV2 teacher for efficiency. Evaluated on the official NIH split, the CLARiTy-S-16-512 (a configuration of CLARiTy), achieves competitive classification performance across 14 pathologies, and state-of-the-art weakly-supervised localization performance on 8 pathologies, outperforming prior methods by 50.7%. In particular, pronounced gains occur for small pathologies like nodules and masses. The lower-resolution variant of CLARiTy, CLARiTy-S-16-224, offers high efficiency while decisively surpassing baselines, thereby having the potential for use in low-resource settings. An ablation study confirms contributions of SegmentCAM, DINO pretraining, orthogonal class token loss, and attention pooling. CLARiTy advances beyond CNN-ViT hybrids by harnessing ViT self-attention for global context and class-specific localization, refined through convolutional background suppression for precise, noise-reduced heatmaps.

Abstract: In recent years, Predictive Process Mining (PPM) techniques based on artificial neural networks have evolved as a method for monitoring the future behavior of unfolding business processes and predicting Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). However, many PPM approaches often lack reproducibility, transparency in decision making, usability for incorporating novel datasets and benchmarking, making comparisons among different implementations very difficult. In this paper, we propose SPICE, a Python framework that reimplements three popular, existing baseline deep-learning-based methods for PPM in PyTorch, while designing a common base framework with rigorous configurability to enable reproducible and robust comparison of past and future modelling approaches. We compare SPICE to original reported metrics and with fair metrics on 11 datasets.

Abstract: In a previous paper it was shown that a machine learning regression problem can be solved within the framework of random function theory, with the optimal kernel analytically derived from symmetry and indifference principles and coinciding with a polyharmonic spline. However, a direct application of that solution is limited by O(N^3) computational cost and by a breakdown of the original theoretical assumptions when the input space has excessive dimensionality. This paper proposes a cascade architecture built from packages of polyharmonic splines that simultaneously addresses scalability and is theoretically justified for problems with unknown intrinsic low dimensionality. Efficient matrix procedures are presented for forward computation and end-to-end differentiation through the cascade.

Motivation: 印尼朝觐与副朝服务的快速数字化在便利朝觐者的同时，也催生了通过虚假移动应用进行的数字欺诈。这些欺诈应用不仅造成经济损失，还通过收集敏感个人数据带来严重的隐私风险。

Method: 研究采用混合特征提取方法，结合应用描述的文本分析（TF-IDF）和敏感访问权限的元数据分析。使用包含官方注册应用和非官方应用的数据集，比较了支持向量机（SVM）、随机森林（RF）和朴素贝叶斯（NB）三种分类器的性能。

Result: 实验结果表明，SVM算法表现最佳，准确率达到92.3%，精确度为91.5%，F1分数为92.0%。特征分析发现，与合法性相关的特定关键词和高风险权限（如读取电话状态）是最重要的判别特征。

Conclusion: 该系统可作为增强宗教旅游领域数字信任的主动、可扩展解决方案，有潜力成为国家验证系统的原型。

Abstract: The rapid digitalization of Hajj and Umrah services in Indonesia has significantly facilitated pilgrims but has concurrently opened avenues for digital fraud through counterfeit mobile applications. These fraudulent applications not only inflict financial losses but also pose severe privacy risks by harvesting sensitive personal data. This research aims to address this critical issue by implementing and evaluating machine learning algorithms to verify application authenticity automatically. Using a comprehensive dataset comprising both official applications registered with the Ministry of Religious Affairs and unofficial applications circulating on app stores, we compare the performance of three robust classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Na"ive Bayes (NB). The study utilizes a hybrid feature extraction methodology that combines Textual Analysis (TF-IDF) of application descriptions with Metadata Analysis of sensitive access permissions. The experimental results indicate that the SVM algorithm achieves the highest performance with an accuracy of 92.3%, a precision of 91.5%, and an F1-score of 92.0%. Detailed feature analysis reveals that specific keywords related to legality and high-risk permissions (e.g., READ PHONE STATE) are the most significant discriminators. This system is proposed as a proactive, scalable solution to enhance digital trust in the religious tourism sector, potentially serving as a prototype for a national verification system.

Motivation: GPT架构是语言建模的主流设计，而基于能量的建模（EBM）将推理视为能量景观上的动力学过程。为了统一这两种范式，作者提出了对GPT的最小修改，以便在EBM框架下进行推理探索。

Method: 提出了eNeRgy-GPT（NRGPT），通过对GPT设置进行最小修改，将其与EBM框架统一。模型的推理步骤被概念化为在能量景观上对词元（tokens）的探索，并在特定条件下表现为梯度下降。

Result: 模型在简单语言（莎士比亚数据集）、代数ListOPS任务以及更丰富的OpenWebText语言建模任务中表现良好。实验还发现，NRGPT模型具有更强的抗过拟合能力，仅在极长时间训练后才出现过拟合现象。

Conclusion: NRGPT成功地将GPT与EBM框架统一，提供了一种新的推理视角，并在多种语言任务中验证了其有效性，同时展现出更优的抗过拟合特性，为语言建模提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) architectures are the most popular design for language modeling. Energy-based modeling is a different paradigm that views inference as a dynamical process operating on an energy landscape. We propose a minimal modification of the GPT setting to unify it with the EBM framework. The inference step of our model, which we call eNeRgy-GPT (NRGPT), is conceptualized as an exploration of the tokens on the energy landscape. We prove, and verify empirically, that under certain circumstances this exploration becomes gradient descent, although they don't necessarily lead to the best performing models. We demonstrate that our model performs well for simple language (Shakespeare dataset), algebraic ListOPS tasks, and richer settings such as OpenWebText language modeling. We also observe that our models may be more resistant to overfitting, doing so only during very long training.

Abstract: A complex system comprises multiple interacting entities whose interdependencies form a unified whole, exhibiting emergent behaviours not present in individual components. Examples include the human brain, living cells, soft matter, Earth's climate, ecosystems, and the economy. These systems exhibit high-dimensional, non-linear dynamics, making their modelling, classification, and prediction particularly challenging. Advances in information technology have enabled data-driven approaches to studying such systems. However, the sheer volume and complexity of spatio-temporal data often hinder traditional methods like dimensionality reduction, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analysing spatio-temporal data from complex systems, grounded in the theory of vector fields over discrete measure spaces. We propose a two-parameter family of metrics suitable for data analysis and machine learning applications. The framework supports time-dependent images, image gradients, and real- or vector-valued functions defined on graphs and simplicial complexes. We validate our approach using data from numerical simulations of biological and physical systems on flat and curved domains. Our results show that the proposed metrics, combined with multidimensional scaling, effectively address key analytical challenges. They enable dimensionality reduction, mode decomposition, phase-space reconstruction, and attractor characterisation. Our findings offer a robust pathway for understanding complex dynamical systems, especially in contexts where traditional modelling is impractical but abundant experimental data are available.

Abstract: Modern LLM applications such as deep-research assistants, coding agents, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, repeatedly process long prompt histories containing shared document or code chunks, creating significant pressure on the Key Value (KV) cache, which must operate within limited memory while sustaining high throughput and low latency. Prefix caching partially alleviates some of these costs by reusing KV cache for previously processed tokens, but limited by strict prefix matching. Position-independent caching (PIC) enables chunk-level reuse at arbitrary positions, but requires selective recomputation and positional-encoding (PE) adjustments. However, because these operations vary across queries, KV for the same chunk diverges across requests. Moreover, without page alignment, chunk KV layouts diverge in memory, preventing page sharing. These issues result in only modest HBM savings even when many requests reuse the same content.
  We present MEPIC, a memory-efficient PIC system that enables chunk KV reuse across positions, requests, and batches. MEPIC aligns chunk KV to paged storage, shifts recomputation from token- to block-level so only the first block is request-specific, removes positional encodings via Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) fusion in the attention kernel, and makes remaining blocks fully shareable. These techniques eliminate most duplicate chunk KV in HBM, reducing usage by up to 2x over state-of-the-art PIC at comparable latency and accuracy, and up to 5x for long prompts, without any model changes.

Abstract: Neural network controllers increasingly demand millions of parameters, and language model approaches push into the billions. For embedded aerospace systems with strict power and latency constraints, this scaling is prohibitive. We present Tiny Recursive Control (TRC), a neural architecture based on a counterintuitive principle: capacity can emerge from iteration depth rather than parameter count. TRC applies compact networks (approximately 1.5M parameters) repeatedly through a two-level hierarchical latent structure, refining control sequences by simulating trajectories and correcting based on tracking error. Because the same weights process every refinement step, adding iterations increases computation without increasing memory. We evaluate TRC on nonlinear control problems including oscillator stabilization and powered descent with fuel constraints. Across these domains, TRC achieves near-optimal control costs while requiring only millisecond-scale inference on GPU and under 10~MB memory, two orders of magnitude smaller than language model baselines. These results demonstrate that recursive reasoning, previously confined to discrete tasks, transfers effectively to continuous control synthesis.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled the training of large language model (LLM) agents to interact with the environment and to solve multi-turn long-horizon tasks. However, the RL-trained agents often struggle in tasks that require active exploration and fail to efficiently adapt from trial-and-error experiences. In this paper, we present LaMer, a general Meta-RL framework that enables LLM agents to actively explore and learn from the environment feedback at test time. LaMer consists of two key components: (i) a cross-episode training framework to encourage exploration and long-term rewards optimization; and (ii) in-context policy adaptation via reflection, allowing the agent to adapt their policy from task feedback signal without gradient update. Experiments across diverse environments show that LaMer significantly improves performance over RL baselines, with 11%, 14%, and 19% performance gains on Sokoban, MineSweeper and Webshop, respectively. Moreover, LaMer also demonstrates better generalization to more challenging or previously unseen tasks compared to the RL-trained agents. Overall, our results demonstrate that Meta-RL provides a principled approach to induce exploration in language agents, enabling more robust adaptation to novel environments through learned exploration strategies.

Abstract: Edge machine learning (Edge ML) enables training ML models using the vast data distributed across network edges. However, many existing approaches assume static models trained centrally and then deployed, making them ineffective against unseen data. To address this, Online Edge ML allows models to be trained directly on edge devices and updated continuously with new data. This paper explores a key challenge of Online Edge ML: "How to determine labels for truly future, unseen data points". We propose Knowledge Transformation (KT), a hybrid method combining Knowledge Distillation, Active Learning, and causal reasoning. In short, KT acts as the oracle in active learning by transforming knowledge from a teacher model to generate pseudo-labels for training a student model. To verify the validity of the method, we conducted simulation experiments with two setups: (1) using a less stable teacher model and (2) a relatively more stable teacher model. Results indicate that when a stable teacher model is given, the student model can eventually reach its expected maximum performance. KT is potentially beneficial for scenarios that meet the following circumstances: (1) when the teacher's task is generic, which means existing pre-trained models might be adequate for its task, so there will be no need to train the teacher model from scratch; and/or (2) when the label for the student's task is difficult or expensive to acquire.

Abstract: To cope with real-world dynamics, an intelligent system needs to incrementally acquire, update, and exploit knowledge throughout its lifetime. This ability, known as Continual learning, provides a foundation for AI systems to develop themselves adaptively. Catastrophic forgetting is a major challenge to the progress of Continual Learning approaches, where learning a new task usually results in a dramatic performance drop on previously learned ones. Many approaches have emerged to counteract the impact of CF. Most of the proposed approaches can be categorized into five classes: replay-based, regularization-based, optimization-based, representation-based, and architecture-based. In this work, we approach the problem from a different angle, specifically by considering the optimal sequencing of tasks as they are presented to the model. We investigate the role of task sequencing in mitigating CF and propose a method for determining the optimal task order. The proposed method leverages zero-shot scoring algorithms inspired by neural architecture search (NAS). Results demonstrate that intelligent task sequencing can substantially reduce CF. Moreover, when combined with traditional continual learning strategies, sequencing offers enhanced performance and robustness against forgetting. Additionally, the presented approaches can find applications in other fields, such as curriculum learning.

Motivation: 随着AI技术进入新闻研究和新闻编辑室应用，这些基于历史数据训练的模型可能编码过去的刻板印象。本文旨在调查一个具体案例——基于《纽约时报》标注语料训练的分类器中'blacks'标签的偏差问题。

Method: 通过量化和定性方法，结合可解释AI技术，分析了'blacks'标签在训练语料中的使用情况、编码的概念及其对模型使用的影响。

Result: 研究发现'blacks'标签在一定程度上充当了针对某些少数群体的'种族主义检测器'，但在处理现代议题（如COVID-19期间反亚裔仇恨报道、黑命贵运动报道）时表现不佳。

Conclusion: 这项案例研究揭示了AI模型中嵌入的历史偏见如何导致意外输出，影响新闻报道的多种应用场景（故事发现、受众定位、摘要等），并指出了新闻编辑室采用AI工具时面临的核心矛盾：如何在利用AI工具的同时减少历史偏见在新闻报道中的再现。

Abstract: AI technologies have rapidly moved into business and research applications that involve large text corpora, including computational journalism research and newsroom settings. These models, trained on extant data from various sources, can be conceptualized as historical artifacts that encode decades-old attitudes and stereotypes. This paper investigates one such example trained on the broadly-used New York Times Annotated Corpus to create a multi-label classifier. Our use in research settings surfaced the concerning "blacks" thematic topic label. Through quantitative and qualitative means we investigate this label's use in the training corpus, what concepts it might be encoding in the trained classifier, and how those concepts impact our model use. Via the application of explainable AI methods, we find that the "blacks" label operates partially as a general "racism detector" across some minoritized groups. However, it performs poorly against expectations on modern examples such as COVID-19 era anti-Asian hate stories, and reporting on the Black Lives Matter movement. This case study of interrogating embedded biases in a model reveals how similar applications in newsroom settings can lead to unexpected outputs that could impact a wide variety of potential uses of any large language model-story discovery, audience targeting, summarization, etc. The fundamental tension this exposes for newsrooms is how to adopt AI-enabled workflow tools while reducing the risk of reproducing historical biases in news coverage.

TL;DR: 该论文提出后验行为克隆（PostBC）方法，通过建模演示者的后验行为分布来改进预训练策略，为后续强化学习微调提供更好的初始化，较传统行为克隆在机器人任务中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前预训练-微调范式存在问题：预训练策略作为强化学习微调初始化的有效性被忽视。传统行为克隆可能无法覆盖演示者的所有动作，影响微调效果。

Method: 提出后验行为克隆（PostBC）：不直接拟合演示动作，而是建模给定演示数据集后演示者行为的后验分布。该方法仅需标准监督学习即可实现，与现代生成模型兼容。

Result: PostBC确保对演示者动作的覆盖，预训练性能不低于传统BC。在实际机器人控制基准和真实世界机器人操作任务中，PostBC引导的RL微调性能显著优于传统BC。

Conclusion: PostBC为强化学习微调提供了更有效的预训练初始化方法，既保持预训练性能又改善微调效果，适用于需要预训练-微调流程的各种领域。

Abstract: Standard practice across domains from robotics to language is to first pretrain a policy on a large-scale demonstration dataset, and then finetune this policy, typically with reinforcement learning (RL), in order to improve performance on deployment domains. This finetuning step has proved critical in achieving human or super-human performance, yet while much attention has been given to developing more effective finetuning algorithms, little attention has been given to ensuring the pretrained policy is an effective initialization for RL finetuning. In this work we seek to understand how the pretrained policy affects finetuning performance, and how to pretrain policies in order to ensure they are effective initializations for finetuning. We first show theoretically that standard behavioral cloning (BC) -- which trains a policy to directly match the actions played by the demonstrator -- can fail to ensure coverage over the demonstrator's actions, a minimal condition necessary for effective RL finetuning. We then show that if, instead of exactly fitting the observed demonstrations, we train a policy to model the posterior distribution of the demonstrator's behavior given the demonstration dataset, we do obtain a policy that ensures coverage over the demonstrator's actions, enabling more effective finetuning. Furthermore, this policy -- which we refer to as the posterior behavioral cloning (PostBC) policy -- achieves this while ensuring pretrained performance is no worse than that of the BC policy. We then show that PostBC is practically implementable with modern generative models in robotic control domains -- relying only on standard supervised learning -- and leads to significantly improved RL finetuning performance on both realistic robotic control benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, as compared to standard behavioral cloning.

Abstract: This paper examines the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), a framework for improving the reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent studies suggest that RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two seemingly paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards, which suppress exploitation by rewarding outcomes unrelated to the ground truth, and entropy minimization, which suppresses exploration by pushing the model toward more confident and deterministic outputs, highlighting a puzzling dynamic: both discouraging exploitation and discouraging exploration improve reasoning performance, yet the underlying principles that reconcile these effects remain poorly understood. We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. We further propose a reward-misalignment model explaining why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings. Our findings clarify the mechanisms behind spurious-reward benefits and provide principles for more effective RLVR training.
