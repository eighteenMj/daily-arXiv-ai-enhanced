Paired statistical tests confirm that the performance gains are statistically significant, while class-wise sensitivity and specificity demonstrate robust behavior across diagnostic categories.

Despite the advantages of these synthesizable data sources, the indiscriminate use of generated images as real images for training can even cause mode collapse due to modality discrepancies between real and synthetic domains. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for discriminative use of generated images, coined GMAIL, that explicitly treats generated images as a separate modality from real images. Instead of indiscriminately replacing real images with generated ones in the pixel space, our approach bridges the two distinct modalities in the same latent space through a multi-modal learning approach. To be specific, we first fine-tune a model exclusively on generated images using a cross-modality alignment loss and then employ this aligned model to further train various vision-language models with generated images. By aligning the two modalities, our approach effectively leverages the benefits of recent advances in generative models, thereby boosting the effectiveness of generated image learning across a range of vision-language tasks. Our framework can be easily incorporated with various vision-language models, and we demonstrate its efficacy throughout extensive experiments. For example, our framework significantly improves performance on image captioning, zero-shot image retrieval, zero-shot image classification, and long caption retrieval tasks. It also shows positive generated data scaling trends and notable enhancements in the captioning performance of the large multimodal model, LLaVA.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGMAIL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u6a21\u6001\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u7b80\u5355\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5408\u6210\u9ad8\u5ea6\u903c\u771f\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f46\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f1a\u7531\u4e8e\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u5730\u5229\u7528\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u635f\u5931\u5728\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2. \u7528\u5bf9\u9f50\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\u5404\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff1b3. \u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8f7b\u677e\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u957f\u63cf\u8ff0\u68c0\u7d22\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u5c55\u793a\u51fa\u79ef\u6781\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6269\u5c55\u8d8b\u52bf\uff1b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578bLLaVA\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "GMAIL\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u6a21\u6001\u5e76\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u826f\u597d\u901a\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

To address this, Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) are commonly used to enforce safety constraints while optimizing performance. However, existing methods often suffer from significant safety violations or require a high sample complexity to generate near-optimal policies. We address two settings: relaxed feasibility, where small violations are allowed, and strict feasibility, where no violation is allowed. We propose a model-based primal-dual algorithm that balances regret and bounded constraint violations, drawing on techniques from online RL and constrained optimization. For relaxed feasibility, we prove that our algorithm returns an $\\varepsilon$-optimal policy with $\\varepsilon$-bounded violation with arbitrarily high probability, requiring $\\tilde{O}\\left(\\frac{SAH^3}{\\varepsilon^2}\\right)$ learning episodes, matching the lower bound for unconstrained MDPs.

This result matches the lower bound for learning CMDPs with access to a generative model.\n  Our results demonstrate that learning CMDPs in an online setting is as easy as learning with a generative model and is no more challenging than learning unconstrained MDPs when small violations are allowed.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We divide the deployment region into cells and model it as a graph, with the nodes representing individual cells and edges representing possible UAV mobility patterns. To evaluate the freshness of collected information from this graph, we adopt the Age of Information (AoI) metric, measured separately for each cell. Under a given deployment of IoT nodes and UAV mobility patterns, our objective is to ascertain whether the system should actually utilize monitoring updates from satellites - a seemingly simple yet surprisingly elusive question. For stationary randomized scheduling policies, we develop closed-form expressions and lower bounds for the weighted-sum AoI and utilize this analysis to explore performance tradeoffs as system parameters vary.

Integrating EIO models into the MBSE-HFGT workflow demonstrates how the structural form and function of economic systems can be expressed through SysML's graphical ontology and subsequently translated into the computational structure of HFGT. Using a synthetic Rectangular Choice of Technology (RCOT) example as a pedagogical foundation, the study confirms that the dynamics captured by basic EIO models, as well as other complex economic models grounded in EIO theory, can be equivalently reproduced within the MBSE-HFGT framework. The integration with MBSE and HFGT thus preserves analytical precision while offering enhanced graphical clarity and system-level insight through a shared ontological structure.

Recent diffusion-based estimators leverage learned generative priors to improve pilot-based channel estimation; but they do not exploit second-order structural information estimated from data symbols. In practical systems, the channel Gram matrix can be estimated from received symbols and it provides realization-level information about channel subspace structure. The proposed method integrates a pre-trained angular-domain diffusion prior with two complementary guidance mechanisms: a novel Gram-matrix guidance term that enforces second-order consistency during the reverse diffusion process, and likelihood guidance from pilot observations. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-matched initialization and adaptive guidance scaling ensure stability and low inference latency. Simulations on 3GPP and QuaDRiGa channel models demonstrate consistent normalized mean-squared error (NMSE) improvements over deterministic diffusion baselines, achieving 4 to 6 dB SNR gains at an NMSE of 0.1 over the baseline in Fest et al. (2024).

To instantiate this, we repurpose five oral and spotlight papers from ICML, ICLR, and ACL. From each paper's repository, we preserve the datasets, evaluation harness, and baseline implementations but withhold the paper's proposed method. This results in five containerized task environments comprising 39 sub-tasks in total. Within each environment, agents must propose novel hypotheses, run experiments, and attempt to surpass strong human baselines on the paper's metrics. In a controlled evaluation of an agent powered by GPT-5, we observe a sharp capability--reliability gap. The agent improves over the provided baselines from the repository in just 1 of 15 evaluations (6.7%) by 11.5%, and completes only 26.5% of sub-tasks on average. We identify recurring long-horizon failure modes, including impatience, poor time and resource management, overconfidence in weak hypotheses, difficulty coordinating parallel experiments, and hard limits from context length. Yet in a single run, the agent surpasses the solution of an ICML 2025 Spotlight task, indicating that frontier agents can occasionally reach state-of-the-art performance, but do so unreliably.

While advances in open-vocabulary object detection provide promising solutions for object localization, interaction recognition (IR) remains challenging due to the combinatorial diversity of interactions. Existing methods, including two-stage methods, tightly couple IR with a specific detector and rely on coarse-grained vision-language model (VLM) features, which limit generalization to unseen interactions. In this work, we propose a decoupled framework that separates object detection from IR and leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for zero-shot IR. We introduce a deterministic generation method that formulates IR as a visual question answering task and enforces deterministic outputs, enabling training-free zero-shot IR. To further enhance performance and efficiency by fine-tuning the model, we design a spatial-aware pooling module that integrates appearance and pairwise spatial cues, and a one-pass deterministic matching method that predicts all candidate interactions in a single forward pass. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO demonstrate that our method achieves superior zero-shot performance, strong cross-dataset generalization, and the flexibility to integrate with any object detectors without retraining.

In this paper, we extend NODEs to M-polyfolds (spaces that can simultaneously accommodate varying dimensions and a notion of differentiability) and introduce PolyNODEs, the first variable-dimensional flow-based model in geometric deep learning. As an example application, we construct explicit M-polyfolds featuring dimensional bottlenecks and PolyNODE autoencoders based on parametrised vector fields that traverse these bottlenecks. We demonstrate experimentally that our PolyNODE models can be trained to solve reconstruction tasks in these spaces, and that latent representations of the input can be extracted and used to solve downstream classification tasks.

Yet even when each component density is simple, the differential entropy of the mixture is notoriously hard to compute because the mixture couples a logarithm with a sum. This paper develops a deterministic, closed-form toolkit for bounding and accurately approximating mixture entropy directly from component parameters. Our starting point is an information-theoretic channel viewpoint: the latent mixture label plays the role of an input, and the observation is the output. This viewpoint separates mixture entropy into an average within-component uncertainty plus an overlap term that quantifies how much the observation reveals about the hidden label. We then bound and approximate this overlap term using pairwise overlap integrals between component densities, yielding explicit expressions whenever these overlaps admit a closed form.

We investigate methods for modifying teacher-generated reasoning traces to achieve two objectives that deter unauthorized distillation: (1) \\emph{anti-distillation}, or degrading the training usefulness of query responses, and (2) \\emph{API watermarking}, which embeds verifiable signatures in student models. We introduce several approaches for dynamically rewriting a teacher's reasoning outputs while preserving answer correctness and semantic coherence. Two of these leverage the rewriting capabilities of LLMs, while others use gradient-based techniques. Our experiments show that a simple instruction-based rewriting approach achieves a strong anti-distillation effect while maintaining or even improving teacher performance.

While existing studies of nonstationary transport rely primarily on numerical solutions of advection--diffusion equations or parametric impulse-response fitting, they do not provide a closed-form description of trajectory-level arrival dynamics at absorbing boundaries. By adopting a change-of-measure formulation, we reveal a structural decomposition of the first-hitting-time density into a cumulative-drift displacement term and a stochastic boundary-flux modulation factor. This leads to an explicit analytical expression for the Corrected-Inverse-Gaussian (C-IG) density, extending the classical IG model to strongly nonstationary drift conditions while preserving constant-complexity evaluation. High-precision Monte Carlo simulations under both smooth pulsatile and abrupt switching drift profiles confirm that the proposed model accurately captures complex transport phenomena, including phase modulation, multi-pulse dispersion, and transient backflow.

Finally, best-of-$N$ selection provides an inference-time addition by choosing the best feasible candidate under the target metric.

A common approach is retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which stores verbatim documents externally (as chunks) and retrieves only a relevant subset at inference time for an LLM to reason over. However, this results in inefficient usage of test-time compute (LLM repeatedly reasons over the same documents); moreover, chunk retrieval can inject irrelevant context that increases unsupported generation. We propose a human-like non-parametric continual learning framework, where the base model remains fixed, and learning occurs by integrating each new experience into an external semantic memory state that accumulates and consolidates itself continually. We present Panini, which realizes this by representing documents as Generative Semantic Workspaces (GSW) -- an entity- and event-aware network of question-answer (QA) pairs, sufficient for an LLM to reconstruct the experienced situations and mine latent knowledge via reasoning-grounded inference chains on the network. Given a query, Panini only traverses the continually-updated GSW (not the verbatim documents or chunks), and retrieves the most likely inference chains. Across six QA benchmarks, Panini achieves the highest average performance, 5%-7% higher than other competitive baselines, while using 2-30x fewer answer-context tokens, supports fully open-source pipelines, and reduces unsupported answers on curated unanswerable queries. The results show that efficient and accurate structuring of experiences at write time -- as achieved by the GSW framework -- yields both efficiency and reliability gains at read time.

However, many real-world video datasets suffer from annotation errors such as *mislabeling*, where segments are assigned incorrect class labels, and *disordering*, where the temporal sequence does not follow the correct progression. These errors are particularly harmful in phase-annotated tasks, where temporal consistency is critical. We propose a novel, model-agnostic method for detecting annotation errors by analyzing the Cumulative Sample Loss (CSL)--defined as the average loss a frame incurs when passing through model checkpoints saved across training epochs. This per-frame loss trajectory acts as a dynamic fingerprint of frame-level learnability. Mislabeled or disordered frames tend to show consistently high or irregular loss patterns, as they remain difficult for the model to learn throughout training, while correctly labeled frames typically converge to low loss early. To compute CSL, we train a video segmentation model and store its weights at each epoch. These checkpoints are then used to evaluate the loss of each frame in a test video. Frames with persistently high CSL are flagged as likely candidates for annotation errors, including mislabeling or temporal misalignment.

We rely on measurement campaigns to deliver parametrized propagation models, and on the 3GPP standards process to optimize model-based performance, but as wireless networks become more complex this model-based approach is losing ground. Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) are counting on Artificial Intelligence (AI) to transform wireless by increasing spectral efficiency, reducing signaling overhead, and enabling continuous network innovation through software upgrades. They may also be interested in new use cases like integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). All we need is an AI-native physical layer, so why not simply tailor the offline AI algorithms that have revolutionized image and natural language processing to the wireless domain? We argue that these algorithms rely on off-line training that is precluded by the sub-millisecond speeds at which the wireless interference environment changes. We present an alternative architecture, a universal neural receiver based on convolution, which governs transmit and receive signal processing of any signal in any part of the wireless spectrum. Our neural receiver is designed to invert convolution, and we separate the question of which convolution to invert from the actual deconvolution. The neural network that performs deconvolution is very simple, and we configure this network by setting weights based on domain knowledge. By telling our neural network what we know, we avoid extensive offline training. By developing a universal receiver, we hope to simplify discussions about the proper choice of waveform for different use cases in the international standards. Since the receiver architecture is largely independent of technologies introduced at the base station, we hope to increase the rate of innovation in wireless.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In federated GNN settings, client graphs often exhibit heterogeneous structural and propagation characteristics. When standard aggregation mechanisms are applied to such heterogeneous updates, the global model may converge numerically while exhibiting degraded relational behavior.Our work identifies a geometric failure mode of global aggregation in Cross- Domain Federated GNNs. Although GNN parameters are numerically represented as vectors, they encode relational transformations that govern the direction, strength, and sensitivity of information flow across graph neighborhoods. Aggregating updates originating from incompatible propagation regimes can therefore introduce destructive interference in this transformation space.This leads to loss of coherence in global message passing. Importantly, this degradation is not necessarily reflected in conventional metrics such as loss or accuracy.To address this issue, we propose GGRS (Global Geometric Reference Structure), a server-side framework that regulates client updates prior to aggregation based on geometric admissibility criteria. GGRS preserves directional consistency of relational transformations as well as maintains diversity of admissible propagation subspaces. It also stabilizes sensitivity to neighborhood interactions, without accessing client data or graph topology. Experiments on heterogeneous GNN-native, Amazon Co-purchase datasets demonstrate that GGRS preserves global message-passing coherence across training rounds by highlighting the necessity of geometry-aware regulation in federated graph learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

For nonlinear systems with inputs, Koopman-based modeling is effective because the Koopman operator enables a high-dimensional linear representation of nonlinear dynamics. However, traditional approaches face significant challenges in industrial applications. Measuring all system states is often impractical due to constraints on sensor installation. Moreover, the predictive performance of a Koopman model strongly depends on the choice of lifting functions, and their design typically requires substantial manual effort. In addition, although a linear time-invariant (LTI) Koopman model is the most commonly used model structure in the Koopman framework, such model exhibit limited predictive accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose an input-output bilinear Koopman modeling in which the design parameters of radial basis function (RBF)-based lifting functions are optimized using a global metaheuristic algorithm to improve long-term prediction performance. Consideration of the long-term prediction performance enhances the reliability of the resulting model. The proposed methodology is validated in simulations and experimental tests, with the airpath control system of a diesel engine as the plant to be modeled. This plant represents a challenging industrial application because it exhibits strong nonlinearities and coupled multi-input multi-output (MIMO) dynamics.

The approach is provisionally designated da Costian-Tarskianism, named after da Costa's Principle of Tolerance in Mathematics and after Alfred Tarski's work on the concept of a consequence operator. The approach is based on the machinery of consequence systems, as developed by Carnielli et al.

The paper also defines the concept of an extended development graph, which is a graph structure that allows ontologies to be related via morphisms of extended consequence systems, and additionally via other operations such as fibring and splitting.

Conventional super-resolution approaches typically rely on paired datasets of downsampled and original high resolution images, training models to reconstruct high resolution images from their artificially degraded counterparts. However, in real-world clinical settings, low resolution data often arise from acquisition mechanisms that differ significantly from simple downsampling. As a result, these inputs may lie outside the domain of the training data, leading to poor model generalization due to domain shift. To address this limitation, we propose a distributional deep learning framework that improves model robustness and domain generalization. We develop this approch for enhancing the resolution of 4D Flow MRI (4DF). This is a novel imaging modality that captures hemodynamic flow velocity and clinically relevant metrics such as vessel wall stress. These metrics are critical for assessing aneurysm rupture risk. Our model is initially trained on high resolution computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and their downsampled counterparts. It is then fine-tuned on a small, harmonized dataset of paired 4D Flow MRI and CFD samples. We derive the theoretical properties of our distributional estimators and demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms traditional deep learning approaches through real data applications. This highlights the effectiveness of distributional learning in addressing domain shift and improving super-resolution performance in clinically realistic scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u5e03\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad84D Flow MRI\u7684\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u9886\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u964d\u8d28\u56fe\u50cf\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u771f\u5b9e\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6570\u636e\u6765\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u91c7\u96c6\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9886\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5148\u7528\u8ba1\u7b97\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6570\u636e\u53ca\u5176\u964d\u91c7\u6837\u7248\u672c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u518d\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u914d\u5bf9\u76844D Flow MRI\u548cCFD\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u5e03\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u8d28\u63a8\u5bfc", "result": "\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5206\u5e03\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u9886\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\u95ee\u9898", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5e03\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u9886\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf94D Flow MRI\u8840\u6d41\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6307\u6807\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u5e94\u7528"}}

To investigate this effect, we build a controlled synthetic retrieval task and find that a transformer trained only on text achieves perfect in-distribution accuracy but fails to generalize out of distribution, while subsequent training on an image-tokenized version of the same task nearly doubles text-only OOD performance. Mechanistic interpretability reveals that visual training changes the model's internal binding strategy: text-only training encourages positional shortcuts, whereas image-based training disrupts them through spatial translation invariance, forcing the model to adopt a more robust symbolic binding mechanism that persists even after text-only examples are reintroduced. We further characterize how binding strategies vary across training regimes, visual encoders, and initializations, and show that analogous shifts occur during pretrained LLM-to-VLM transitions.

We initiate a comparative study of LLM risky choices along two dimensions: (1) prospect representation (explicit vs. experience based) and (2) decision rationale (explanation). Our study, which involves 20 frontier and open LLMs, is complemented by a matched human subjects experiment, which provides one reference point, while an expected payoff maximizing rational agent model provides another. We find that LLMs cluster into two categories: reasoning models (RMs) and conversational models (CMs). RMs tend towards rational behavior, are insensitive to the order of prospects, gain/loss framing, and explanations, and behave similarly whether prospects are explicit or presented via experience history. CMs are significantly less rational, slightly more human-like, sensitive to prospect ordering, framing, and explanation, and exhibit a large description-history gap.

Outcome of a master and bachelor student project completed in Visual and Spatial AI Lab at TAMU", "summary": "Camera virtualization -- an emerging solution to novel view synthesis -- holds transformative potential for visual entertainment, live performances, and sports broadcasting by enabling the generation of photorealistic images from novel viewpoints using images from a limited set of calibrated multiple static physical cameras. Despite recent advances, achieving spatially and temporally coherent and photorealistic rendering of dynamic scenes with efficient time-archival capabilities, particularly in fast-paced sports and stage performances, remains challenging for existing approaches. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for dynamic scenes could offer real-time view-synthesis results. Yet, they are hindered by their dependence on accurate 3D point clouds from the structure-from-motion method and their inability to handle large, non-rigid, rapid motions of different subjects (e.g., flips, jumps, articulations, sudden player-to-player transitions). Moreover, independent motions of multiple subjects can break the Gaussian-tracking assumptions commonly used in 4DGS, ST-GS, and other dynamic splatting variants. This paper advocates reconsidering a neural volume rendering formulation for camera virtualization and efficient time-archival capabilities, making it useful for sports broadcasting and related applications. By modeling a dynamic scene as rigid transformations across multiple synchronized camera views at a given time, our method performs neural representation learning, providing enhanced visual rendering quality at test time. A key contribution of our approach is its support for time-archival, i.e., users can revisit any past temporal instance of a dynamic scene and can perform novel view synthesis, enabling retrospective rendering for replay, analysis, and archival of live events, a functionality absent in existing neural rendering approaches and novel view synthesis...", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u4f53\u79ef\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u865a\u62df\u5316\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u5feb\u901f\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u6e32\u67d3\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u65f6\u95f4\u5f52\u6863\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u98de\u6e85\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u6e32\u67d3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u51c6\u786e3D\u70b9\u4e91\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u5927\u578b\u975e\u521a\u6027\u5feb\u901f\u8fd0\u52a8\uff08\u5982\u7ffb\u8f6c\u3001\u8df3\u8dc3\u3001\u5173\u8282\u8fd0\u52a8\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u4e3b\u4f53\u72ec\u7acb\u8fd0\u52a8\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u9ad8\u65af\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u4f53\u80b2\u76f4\u64ad\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0b\u591a\u4e2a\u540c\u6b65\u76f8\u673a\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u521a\u6027\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u652f\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u5f52\u6863\u529f\u80fd\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u7528\u6237\u56de\u6eaf\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u8fc7\u53bb\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u56de\u653e\u3001\u5206\u6790\u548c\u73b0\u573a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5f52\u6863\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u91cd\u65b0\u8003\u8651\u795e\u7ecf\u4f53\u79ef\u6e32\u67d3\u516c\u5f0f\u7528\u4e8e\u76f8\u673a\u865a\u62df\u5316\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u65f6\u95f4\u5f52\u6863\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f53\u80b2\u5e7f\u64ad\u53ca\u76f8\u5173\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u6e32\u67d3\u65b9\u6cd5\u6240\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7684\u56de\u987e\u6027\u6e32\u67d3\u529f\u80fd\u3002"}}

Inspired by how numerical solvers are compatible with simulations of different settings of PDEs, we propose a multiphysics training framework that jointly learns from both the original PDEs and their simplified basic forms. Our framework enhances data efficiency, reduces predictive errors, and improves out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, particularly in scenarios involving shifts of physical parameters and synthetic-to-real transfer. Our method is architecture-agnostic and demonstrates consistent improvements in normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) across a wide range of 1D/2D/3D PDE problems.

However, enforcing a single shared subspace can degrade accuracy even at moderate compression. Sparse dictionary learning provides a more flexible union-of-subspaces representation, but existing approaches often suffer from iterative dictionary and coefficient updates. We propose COMPOT (Calibration-Optimized Matrix Procrustes Orthogonalization for Transformers), a training-free compression framework that uses a small calibration dataset to estimate a sparse weight factorization. COMPOT employs orthogonal dictionaries that enable closed-form Procrustes updates for the dictionary and analytical single-step sparse coding for the coefficients, eliminating iterative optimization. To handle heterogeneous layer sensitivity under a global compression budget, COMPOT further introduces a one-shot dynamic allocation strategy that adaptively redistributes layer-wise compression rates. Extensive experiments across diverse architectures and tasks show that COMPOT consistently delivers a superior quality-compression trade-off over strong low-rank and sparse baselines, while remaining fully compatible with post-training quantization for extreme compression.

Although recent decoupling-based distillation methods enable dataset distillation at large-scale, they continue to face an efficiency gap: optimization-based decoupling methods achieve higher accuracy but demand intensive computation, whereas optimization-free decoupling methods are efficient but sacrifice accuracy. To overcome this trade-off, we propose Exploration-Exploitation Distillation (E^2D), a simple, practical method that minimizes redundant computation through an efficient pipeline that begins with full-image initialization to preserve semantic integrity and feature diversity. It then uses a two-phase optimization strategy: an exploration phase that performs uniform updates and identifies high-loss regions, and an exploitation phase that focuses updates on these regions to accelerate convergence. We evaluate E^2D on large-scale benchmarks, surpassing the state-of-the-art on ImageNet-1K while being 18x faster, and on ImageNet-21K, our method substantially improves accuracy while remaining 4.3x faster. These results demonstrate that targeted, redundancy-reducing updates, rather than brute-force optimization, bridge the gap between accuracy and efficiency in large-scale dataset distillation.

Currently, it remains unclear how to jointly learn reward functions from heterogeneous feedback types such as demonstrations, comparisons, ratings, and stops that provide qualitatively different signals. We address this challenge by formulating reward learning from multiple feedback types as Bayesian inference over a shared latent reward function, where each feedback type contributes information through an explicit likelihood. We introduce a scalable amortized variational inference approach that learns a shared reward encoder and feedback-specific likelihood decoders and is trained by optimizing a single evidence lower bound. Our approach avoids reducing feedback to a common intermediate representation and eliminates the need for manual loss balancing. Across discrete and continuous-control benchmarks, we show that jointly inferred reward posteriors outperform single-type baselines, exploit complementary information across feedback types, and yield policies that are more robust to environment perturbations.

Current methods face two major limitations. First, many rely on a single dataset or follow a sequential data fusion and generation process, which means they fail to capture the complex interplay between features. Second, these approaches struggle with sampling zeros (valid but unobserved attribute combinations) and structural zeros (infeasible combinations due to logical constraints), which reduce the diversity and feasibility of the generated data. This study proposes a novel method to simultaneously integrate and synthesize multi-source datasets using a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with gradient penalty. This joint learning method improves both the diversity and feasibility of synthetic data by defining a regularization term (inverse gradient penalty) for the generator loss function. For the evaluation, we implement a unified evaluation metric for similarity, and place special emphasis on measuring diversity and feasibility through recall, precision, and the F1 score. Results show that the proposed joint approach outperforms the sequential baseline, with recall increasing by 7\\% and precision by 15\\%. Additionally, the regularization term further improves diversity and feasibility, reflected in a 10\\% increase in recall and 1\\% in precision. We assess similarity distributions using a five-metric score. The joint approach performs better overall, and reaches a score of 88.1 compared to 84.6 for the sequential method. Since synthetic populations serve as a key input for ABM, this multi-source generative approach has the potential to significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of ABM.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce a framework for studying this by placing VLMs in controlled image-based choice tasks and systematically perturbing their inputs. Our key idea is to treat the agent's decision function as a latent visual utility that can be inferred through revealed preference: choices between systematically edited images. Starting from common images, such as product photos, we propose methods for visual prompt optimization, adapting text optimization methods to iteratively propose and apply visually plausible modifications using an image generation model (such as in composition, lighting, or background). We then evaluate which edits increase selection probability. Through large-scale experiments on frontier VLMs, we demonstrate that optimized edits significantly shift choice probabilities in head-to-head comparisons. We develop an automatic interpretability pipeline to explain these preferences, identifying consistent visual themes that drive selection.

A further challenge is the performance interference that can arise from joint multilingual training, commonly referred to as the \"curse of multilinguality\". We study multilingual data curation across thirteen languages and find that many reported regressions are not inherent to multilingual scaling but instead stem from correctable deficiencies in data quality and composition rather than fundamental capacity limits. In controlled bilingual experiments, improving data quality for any single language benefits others: curating English improves non-English performance in 12 of 13 languages, while curating non-English yields reciprocal improvements in English. Bespoke per-language curation produces substantially larger within-language improvements. Extending these findings to large-scale general-purpose training mixtures, we show that curated multilingual allocations comprising under 8% of total tokens remain remarkably effective. We operationalize this approach within an effort that produced a 20T-token pretraining corpus derived entirely from public sources. Models with 3B and 8B parameters trained on a 1T-token random subset achieve competitive multilingual accuracy with 4-10x fewer training FLOPs than strong public baselines, establishing a new Pareto frontier in multilingual performance versus compute. Moreover, these benefits extend to frontier model scale: the 20T-token corpus served as part of the pretraining dataset for Trinity Large (400B/A13B), which exhibits strong multilingual performance relative to its training FLOPs.

Any model construction, such as a map, and use, such as planning, needs to be robust against these challenges, and if any learning is to be useful, it needs to be adequately fast. We look at a range of strategies, from simple to sophisticated, with various uses of memory and learning. We find that an architecture that can incorporate multiple strategies is required to handle (sub)tasks of a different nature, in particular for exploration and search, when food location is not known, and for planning a good path to a remembered (likely) food location. An agent that utilizes non-stationary probability learning techniques to keep updating its (episodic) memories and that uses those memories to build maps and plan on the fly (imperfect maps, i.e. noisy and limited to the agent's experience) can be increasingly and substantially more efficient than the simpler (minimal-memory) agents, as the task difficulties such as distance to goal are raised, as long as the uncertainty, from localization and change, is not too large.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We offer a simple approach of using an LLM to iteratively propose and refine candidate biases. Our method can recover known biases and surface novel ones: for example, we found that Skywork-V2-8B, a leading open-weight reward model, often mistakenly favors responses with redundant spacing and responses with hallucinated content. In addition, we show evidence that evolutionary iteration outperforms flat best-of-N search, and we validate the recall of our pipeline using synthetically injected biases.

EAA integrates multimodal reasoning, tool-augmented action, and optional long-term memory to support both autonomous procedures and interactive user-guided measurements. Built on a flexible task-manager architecture, the system enables workflows ranging from fully agent-driven automation to logic-defined routines that embed localized LLM queries. EAA further provides a modern tool ecosystem with two-way compatibility for Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing instrument-control tools to be consumed or served across applications. We demonstrate EAA at an imaging beamline at the Advanced Photon Source, including automated zone plate focusing, natural language-described feature search, and interactive data acquisition.

Extending ZSAD to 3D medical images has proven challenging, with existing methods relying on slice-wise features and vision-language models, which fail to capture volumetric structure. In this paper, we introduce a fully training-free framework for ZSAD in 3D brain MRI that constructs localized volumetric tokens by aggregating multi-axis slices processed by 2D foundation models. These 3D patch tokens restore cubic spatial context and integrate directly with distance-based, batch-level anomaly detection pipelines. The framework provides compact 3D representations that are practical to compute on standard GPUs and require no fine-tuning, prompts, or supervision. Our results show that training-free, batch-based ZSAD can be effectively extended from 2D encoders to full 3D MRI volumes, offering a simple and robust approach for volumetric anomaly detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e2D\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u76843D\u8111MRI\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u5408\u591a\u8f74\u5207\u7247\u6784\u5efa\u5c40\u90e8\u4f53\u79eftoken\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u6279\u91cf\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6d41\u7a0b\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u4e2d\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u53d7\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9650\u4e8e2D\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u800c\u6269\u5c55\u52303D\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5207\u7247\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u4f53\u79ef\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5b8c\u5168\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u54082D\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u7684\u591a\u8f74\u5207\u7247\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u5c40\u90e8\u4f53\u79eftoken\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u7acb\u65b9\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u6279\u91cf\u7ea7\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u6d41\u7a0b\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6279\u91cf\u7ea7\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece2D\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6709\u6548\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5b8c\u6574\u76843D MRI\u4f53\u79ef\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f53\u79ef\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u7d27\u51d1\u76843D\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u6807\u51c6GPU\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u63d0\u793a\u6216\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4e3a3D\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The draft model typically falls into the trap of attention dilution and negative visual gain due to key-value cache explosion and context window mismatches. We observe a visual semantic internalization phenomenon in Vid-LLMs, indicating that critical visual semantics are implicitly encoded into text hidden states during deep-layer interactions, which renders raw visual inputs structurally redundant during deep inference. To address this, we propose the Sparrow framework, which first utilizes visually-aware text-anchored window attention via hidden state reuse to fully offload visual computation to the target model, and leverages intermediate-layer visual state bridging to train the draft model with semantic-rich intermediate states, thereby filtering out low-level visual noise. Additionally, a multi-token prediction strategy is introduced to bridge the training-inference distribution shift. Experiments show that Sparrow achieves an average speedup of 2.82x even with 25k visual tokens, effectively resolving the performance degradation in long sequences and offering a practical solution for real-time long video tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Sparrow\u6846\u67b6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u6295\u673a\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6587\u672c\u951a\u5b9a\u7a97\u53e3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5378\u8f7d\u89c6\u89c9\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u89c6\u89c9\u72b6\u6001\u6865\u63a5\u8bad\u7ec3\u8349\u6848\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0b2.82\u500d\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u52a0\u901f", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6295\u673a\u89e3\u7801\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(Vid-LLMs)\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6027\u80fd\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u952e\u503c\u7f13\u5b58\u7206\u70b8\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u5931\u914d\u5bfc\u81f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7a00\u91ca\u548c\u8d1f\u89c6\u89c9\u589e\u76ca\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0Vid-LLMs\u5b58\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5316\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u6df1\u5c42\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u539f\u59cb\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u5197\u4f59", "method": "1. \u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6587\u672c\u951a\u5b9a\u7a97\u53e3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u91cd\u7528\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b8c\u5168\u5378\u8f7d\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u8349\u6848\u6a21\u578b\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u539f\u59cb\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u30022. \u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u89c6\u89c9\u72b6\u6001\u6865\u63a5\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\u8bad\u7ec3\u8349\u6848\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u4f4e\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u566a\u58f0\u30023. \u591a\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u7f29\u5c0f\u8bad\u7ec3-\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u8ddd", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eSparrow\u5728\u542b\u670925k\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u7684\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e73\u57472.82\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848", "conclusion": "Sparrow\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86Vid-LLMs\u4e2d\u6295\u673a\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u8ba1\u7b97\u5378\u8f7d\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e2d\u95f4\u72b6\u6001\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u4ee4\u724c\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5f3a\u5927\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848"}}

Recent CLIP-style models such as DrugCLIP enable scalable virtual screening by embedding pockets and ligands into a shared space. However, our analyses indicate that such representations can be insensitive to fine-grained binding interactions and may rely on shortcut correlations in training data, limiting their ability to rank ligands by true binding compatibility. To address these issues, we propose BindCLIP, a unified contrastive-generative representation learning framework for virtual screening. BindCLIP jointly trains pocket and ligand encoders using CLIP-style contrastive learning together with a pocket-conditioned diffusion objective for binding pose generation, so that pose-level supervision directly shapes the retrieval embedding space toward interaction-relevant features. To further mitigate shortcut reliance, we introduce hard-negative augmentation and a ligand-ligand anchoring regularizer that prevents representation collapse. Experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. BindCLIP achieves substantial gains on challenging out-of-distribution virtual screening and improves ligand-analogue ranking on the FEP+ benchmark. Together, these results indicate that integrating generative, pose-level supervision with contrastive learning yields more interaction-aware embeddings and improves generalization in realistic screening settings, bringing virtual screening closer to real-world applicability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, these models lack language-based reasoning and interactive capabilities, limiting their usefulness in real-world agronomic workflows. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting and generating text, but cannot directly reason over high-dimensional, heterogeneous agricultural datasets. We bridge this gap with an agentic framework for agricultural science. It provides a Python execution environment, AgriWorld, exposing unified tools for geospatial queries over field parcels, remote-sensing time-series analytics, crop growth simulation, and task-specific predictors (e.g., yield, stress, and disease risk).

Its fundamental challenge lies in the conflict between the unbounded nature of streaming media input and the limited context window of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Current methods primarily rely on passive processing, which often face a trade-off between maintaining long-range context and capturing the fine-grained details necessary for complex tasks. To address this, we introduce EventMemAgent, an active online video agent framework based on a hierarchical memory module. Our framework employs a dual-layer strategy for online videos: short-term memory detects event boundaries and utilizes event-granular reservoir sampling to process streaming video frames within a fixed-length buffer dynamically; long-term memory structuredly archives past observations on an event-by-event basis. Furthermore, we integrate a multi-granular perception toolkit for active, iterative evidence capture and employ Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) to end-to-end internalize reasoning and tool-use strategies into the agent's intrinsic capabilities. Experiments show that EventMemAgent achieves competitive results on online video benchmarks.

To bridge this gap, we propose Distributional Adversarial Training, DAT.

To address these challenges, we propose WAC, a web agent that integrates model collaboration, consequence simulation, and feedback-driven action refinement. To overcome the cognitive isolation of individual models, we introduce a multi-agent collaboration process that enables an action model to consult a world model as a web-environment expert for strategic guidance; the action model then grounds these suggestions into executable actions, leveraging prior knowledge of environmental state transition dynamics to enhance candidate action proposal. To achieve risk-aware resilient task execution, we introduce a two-stage deduction chain. A world model, specialized in environmental state transitions, simulates action outcomes, which a judge model then scrutinizes to trigger action corrective feedback when necessary.

Conventional guardrails based on static rules or fixed confidence thresholds are typically context-insensitive and computationally expensive, resulting in high latency and degraded user experience. To address these limitations, we introduce an adaptive abstention system that dynamically adjusts safety thresholds based on real-time contextual signals such as domain and user history. The proposed framework integrates a multi-dimensional detection architecture composed of five parallel detectors, combined through a hierarchical cascade mechanism to optimize both speed and precision. The cascade design reduces unnecessary computation by progressively filtering queries, achieving substantial latency improvements compared to non-cascaded models and external guardrail systems. Extensive evaluation on mixed and domain-specific workloads demonstrates significant reductions in false positives, particularly in sensitive domains such as medical advice and creative writing. The system maintains high safety precision and near-perfect recall under strict operating modes. Overall, our context-aware abstention framework effectively balances safety and utility while preserving performance, offering a scalable solution for reliable LLM deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our initial analysis shows that, during OPD, training signals are often concentrated in the prefix of each output, and that even a short teacher-generated prefix can significantly help the student produce the correct answer. Motivated by these observations, we propose a simple yet effective modification of OPD: we apply the distillation objective only to prefixes of student-generated outputs and terminate each sampling early during distillation.

We propose a quantum-inspired classification head architecture that projects backbone features into a complex-valued Hilbert space and evolves them under a learned unitary transformation parameterised via the Cayley map. Through a controlled hybrid experimental design - training a single shared backbone and comparing lightweight interchangeable heads - we isolate the effect of complex-valued unitary representations on calibration. Our ablation study on CIFAR-10 reveals that the unitary magnitude head (complex features evolved under a Cayley unitary, read out via magnitude and softmax) achieves an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.0146, representing a 2.4x improvement over a standard softmax head (0.0355) and a 3.5x improvement over temperature scaling (0.0510). Surprisingly, replacing the softmax readout with a Born rule measurement layer - the quantum-mechanically motivated approach - degrades calibration to an ECE of 0.0819. On the CIFAR-10H human-uncertainty benchmark, the wave function head achieves the lowest KL-divergence (0.336) to human soft labels among all compared methods, indicating that complex-valued representations better capture the structure of human perceptual ambiguity.

However, benchmarks can have problems that distort performance, like test set contamination and annotator error. How can we know that a benchmark is a reliable indicator of some capability that we want to measure? This question concerns the construct validity of LLM benchmarks, and it requires separating benchmark results from capabilities when we model and predict LLM performance.\n  Both social scientists and computer scientists propose formal models - latent factor models and scaling laws - for identifying the capabilities underlying benchmark scores. However, neither technique is satisfactory for construct validity. Latent factor models ignore scaling laws, and as a result, the capabilities they extract often proxy model size. Scaling laws ignore measurement error, and as a result, the capabilities they extract are both uninterpretable and overfit to the observed benchmarks.\n  This thesis presents the structured capabilities model, the first model to extract interpretable and generalisable capabilities from a large collection of LLM benchmark results. I fit this model and its two alternatives on a large sample of results from the OpenLLM Leaderboard. Structured capabilities outperform latent factor models on parsimonious fit indices, and exhibit better out-of-distribution benchmark prediction than scaling laws. These improvements are possible because neither existing approach separates model scale from capabilities in the appropriate way. Model scale should inform capabilities, as in scaling laws, and these capabilities should inform observed results up to measurement error, as in latent factor models. In combining these two insights, structured capabilities demonstrate better explanatory and predictive power for quantifying construct validity in LLM evaluations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing methods often introduce semantic hallucinations, where objects from target classes such as traffic signs and vehicles, as well as man-made light effects, are incorrectly synthesized. These hallucinations significantly degrade downstream performance. We propose a novel framework that detects and suppresses hallucinations of target-class features during unpaired translation. To detect hallucination, we design a dual-head discriminator that additionally performs semantic segmentation to identify hallucinated content in background regions. To suppress these hallucinations, we introduce class-specific prototypes, constructed by aggregating features of annotated target-domain objects, which act as semantic anchors for each class. Built upon a Schrodinger Bridge-based translation model, our framework performs iterative refinement, where detected hallucination features are explicitly pushed away from class prototypes in feature space, thus preserving object semantics across the translation trajectory.Experiments show that our method outperforms existing approaches both qualitatively and quantitatively. On the BDD100K dataset, it improves mAP by 15.5% for day-to-night domain adaptation, with a notable 31.7% gain for classes such as traffic lights that are prone to hallucinations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our focus is on the role of information geometry on semantic encoding and the linear representation hypothesis. As an illustrative application, we develop \"dual steering\", a method for robustly steering representations to exhibit a particular concept using linear probes.

Meanwhile, open-source multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong visual-linguistic reasoning, but their potential in biometric forensics remains underexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic zero-shot evaluation of open-source MLLMs for single-image MAD, using publicly available weights and a standardized, reproducible protocol. Across diverse morphing techniques, many MLLMs show non-trivial discriminative ability without any fine-tuning or domain adaptation, and LLaVA1.6-Mistral-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing highly competitive task-specific MAD baselines by at least 23% in terms of equal error rate (EER). The results indicate that multimodal pretraining can implicitly encode fine-grained facial inconsistencies indicative of morphing artifacts, enabling zero-shot forensic sensitivity. Our findings position open-source MLLMs as reproducible, interpretable, and competitive foundations for biometric security and forensic image analysis. This emergent capability also highlights new opportunities to develop state-of-the-art MAD systems through targeted fine-tuning or lightweight adaptation, further improving accuracy and efficiency while preserving interpretability.

These models fail to exploit the strong, persistent spatial priors inherent in such scenes, leading to redundant learning and suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose the Regional Prior attention Transformer for infrared image Super-Resolution (RPT-SR), a novel architecture that explicitly encodes scene layout information into the attention mechanism. Our core contribution is a dual-token framework that fuses (1) learnable, regional prior tokens, which act as a persistent memory for the scene's global structure, with (2) local tokens that capture the frame-specific content of the current input. By utilizing these tokens into an attention, our model allows the priors to dynamically modulate the local reconstruction process. Extensive experiments validate our approach. While most prior works focus on a single infrared band, we demonstrate the broad applicability and versatility of RPT-SR by establishing new state-of-the-art performance across diverse datasets covering both Long-Wave (LWIR) and Short-Wave (SWIR) spectra", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Using large scale observational evaluations with 5k observational and 2k newly sampled data on model performance, we estimate capability boundaries, high conditional quantiles of benchmark scores as a function of log pre training FLOPs, via smoothed quantile regression with a monotone, saturating sigmoid parameterization. We validate the temporal reliability by fitting on earlier model generations and evaluating on later releases. Across various tasks, the estimated boundaries are mostly stable, with the exception of math reasoning that exhibits a consistently advancing boundary over time.

However, existing evaluation methods primarily assess outcome based performance, such as safety and trajectory accuracy, without determining whether model decisions reflect human relevant considerations. As a result, it remains unclear whether explanations produced by such models correspond to genuine reason responsive decision making or merely post hoc rationalizations. This limitation is especially significant in safety critical domains because it can create false confidence. To address this gap, we propose CARE Drive, Context Aware Reasons Evaluation for Driving, a model agnostic framework for evaluating reason responsiveness in vision language models applied to automated driving. CARE Drive compares baseline and reason augmented model decisions under controlled contextual variation to assess whether human reasons causally influence decision behavior. The framework employs a two stage evaluation process. Prompt calibration ensures stable outputs. Systematic contextual perturbation then measures decision sensitivity to human reasons such as safety margins, social pressure, and efficiency constraints. We demonstrate CARE Drive in a cyclist overtaking scenario involving competing normative considerations. Results show that explicit human reasons significantly influence model decisions, improving alignment with expert recommended behavior. However, responsiveness varies across contextual factors, indicating uneven sensitivity to different types of reasons. These findings provide empirical evidence that reason responsiveness in foundation models can be systematically evaluated without modifying model parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CARE Drive\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u539f\u56e0\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u539f\u56e0\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u53d8\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4eba\u7c7b\u539f\u56e0\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u539f\u56e0\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e0d\u5747", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u7ed3\u679c\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u8f68\u8ff9\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u662f\u5426\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f8\u5173\u8003\u8651\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u771f\u6b63\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u56e0\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u4e0e\u4e8b\u540e\u5408\u7406\u5316\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u4f1a\u9020\u6210\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u5fc3", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCARE Drive\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a1.\u63d0\u793a\u6821\u51c6\u786e\u4fdd\u7a33\u5b9a\u8f93\u51fa\uff1b2.\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u53d8\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u539f\u56e0\uff08\u5982\u5b89\u5168\u8fb9\u9645\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u538b\u529b\u3001\u6548\u7387\u7ea6\u675f\uff09\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u539f\u56e0\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u5dee\u5f02", "result": "\u5728\u81ea\u884c\u8f66\u8d85\u8f66\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u539f\u56e0\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u63a8\u8350\u884c\u4e3a\u66f4\u52a0\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u539f\u56e0\u7684\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u539f\u56e0\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e0d\u5747\u7b49", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5373\u53ef\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u54cd\u5e94\u6027\uff0cCARE Drive\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u57fa\u7840"}}

This paper introduces LEADER (Lightweight End-to-end Attention-gated Dual autoencodER), a neural network that maps raw fingerprint images to minutiae descriptors, including location, direction, and type. The proposed architecture integrates non-maximum suppression and angular decoding to enable complete end-to-end inference using only 0.9M parameters. It employs a novel \"Castle-Moat-Rampart\" ground-truth encoding and a dual-autoencoder structure, interconnected through an attention-gating mechanism. Experimental evaluations demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy on plain fingerprints and robust cross-domain generalization to latent impressions. Specifically, LEADER attains a 34% higher F1-score on the NIST SD27 dataset compared to specialized latent minutiae extractors. Sample-level analysis on this challenging benchmark reveals an average rank of 2.07 among all compared methods, with LEADER securing the first-place position in 47% of the samples-more than doubling the frequency of the second-best extractor. The internal representations learned by the model align with established fingerprint domain features, such as segmentation masks, orientation fields, frequency maps, and skeletons.

Existing resampling and reweighting strategies often disrupt inter-label dependencies or require brittle hyperparameter tuning, especially as the label space expands to tens of thousands of labels. To address this issue, we propose Curiosity-Driven Game-Theoretic Multi-Label Learning (CD-GTMLL), a scalable cooperative framework that recasts long-tail MLC as a multi-player game - each sub-predictor (\"player\") specializes in a partition of the label space, collaborating to maximize global accuracy while pursuing intrinsic curiosity rewards based on tail label rarity and inter-player disagreement. This mechanism adaptively injects learning signals into under-represented tail labels without manual balancing or tuning. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that our CD-GTMLL converges to a tail-aware equilibrium and formally links the optimization dynamics to improvements in the Rare-F1 metric. Extensive experiments across 7 benchmarks, including extreme multi-label classification datasets with 30,000+ labels, demonstrate that CD-GTMLL consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods, with gains up to +1.6% P@3 on Wiki10-31K. Ablation studies further confirm the contributions of both game-theoretic cooperation and curiosity-driven exploration to robust tail performance. By integrating game theory with curiosity mechanisms, CD-GTMLL not only enhances model efficiency in resource-constrained environments but also paves the way for more adaptive learning in imbalanced data scenarios across industries like e-commerce and healthcare.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce PERSONA, a training-free framework that achieves fine-tuning level performance through direct manipulation of personality vectors in activation space. Our key insight is that personality traits appear as extractable, approximately orthogonal directions in the model's representation space that support algebraic operations. The framework operates through three stages: Persona-Base extracts orthogonal trait vectors via contrastive activation analysis; Persona-Algebra enables precise control through vector arithmetic (scalar multiplication for intensity, addition for composition, subtraction for suppression); and Persona-Flow achieves context-aware adaptation by dynamically composing these vectors during inference. On PersonalityBench, our approach achieves a mean score of 9.60, nearly matching the supervised fine-tuning upper bound of 9.61 without any gradient updates.

Existing interpretability methods often highlight tokens or spans correlated with an answer, but they rarely reveal where the model makes consequential reasoning turns, which earlier context causally triggers those turns, or whether the highlighted text actually steers the reasoning process. We introduce Directional Reasoning Trajectory Change (DRTC), a process-causal framework for interpreting long-form reasoning from a single on-policy rollout. DRTC detects pivot decision points using uncertainty and distribution-shift signals, then applies receiver-side interventions that preserve the realized rollout without resampling the continuation while blocking information flow from selected earlier chunks only at a pivot. It measures whether each intervention redirects the direction of the model's log-probability trajectory relative to the realized rollout direction, producing a signed per-chunk attribution score. We also compute turning-angle curvature changes on raw logits as a complementary diagnostic and introduce curvature signatures to summarize shared intervention-response geometry. Empirically, directional influence is sharply concentrated across four reasoning models (per-example |DRTC| shares yield Gini 0.50 to 0.58 and top-5 percent mass 0.23 to 0.28), and learned pivots induce stronger intervention magnitudes than matched random spans. In a scaling study on 500 MATH problems with R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, learned spans outperform matched random spans (median delta = 0.409, 355 of 500 positive; sign test p = 2.3e-21).

We propose Recursive Concept Evolution (RCE), a framework that enables pretrained language models to modify their internal representation geometry during inference. RCE introduces dynamically generated low-rank concept subspaces that are spawned when representational inadequacy is detected, selected through a minimum description length criterion, merged when synergistic, and consolidated via constrained optimization to preserve stability. This process allows the model to construct new abstractions rather than recombining existing ones. We integrate RCE with Mistral-7B and evaluate it across compositional reasoning benchmarks.

However, evaluating the quality of these scores remains an open question. Existing biometric capacity estimation literature relies upon error rates. But these rates do not indicate goodness of scores. Thus, in this manuscript we present an exhaustive set of evaluation measures. We firstly identify ranking order and relevance of output scores as the primary basis for evaluation. In particular, we consider both rank deviation as well as rewards for: (i) higher scores of high ranked gestures and (ii) lower scores of low ranked gestures. We also compensate for correspondence between trends of output and ground truth scores. Finally, we account for disentanglement between identity features of gestures as a discounting factor. Integrating these elements with adequate weighting, we formulate advanced acceptance score as a holistic evaluation measure. To assess effectivity of the proposed we perform in-depth experimentation over three datasets with five state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. Results show that the optimal score selected with our measure is more appropriate than existing other measures. Also, our proposed measure depicts correlation with existing measures.

By not waiting for slower clients and executing the training process concurrently, it achieves faster training speed compared to traditional federated learning. However, due to the staleness introduced by the asynchronous process, its performance may degrade in some scenarios. Existing methods often use the round difference between the current model and the global model as the sole measure of staleness, which is coarse-grained and lacks observation of the model itself, thereby limiting the performance ceiling of asynchronous methods. In this paper, we propose FedPSA (Parameter Sensitivity-based Asynchronous Federated Learning), a more fine-grained AFL framework that leverages parameter sensitivity to measure model obsolescence and establishes a dynamic momentum queue to assess the current training phase in real time, thereby adjusting the tolerance for outdated information dynamically. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and comparisons with various methods demonstrate the superior performance of FedPSA, achieving up to 6.37\\% improvement over baseline methods and 1.93\\% over the current state-of-the-art method.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To solve this issue, we propose Global State Diffusion Algorithm~(GlobeDiff) to infer the global state based on the local observations. By formulating the state inference process as a multi-modal diffusion process, GlobeDiff overcomes ambiguities in state estimation while simultaneously inferring the global state with high fidelity. We prove that the estimation error of GlobeDiff under both unimodal and multi-modal distributions can be bounded. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that GlobeDiff achieves superior performance and is capable of accurately inferring the global state.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGlobeDiff\u7684\u5168\u7403\u72b6\u6001\u6269\u6563\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ece\u5c40\u90e8\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u5168\u5c40\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u4e25\u91cd\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u4fe1\u5ff5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u8fc7\u53bb\u7ecf\u9a8c\u800c\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u8f85\u52a9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGlobal State Diffusion Algorithm\uff08GlobeDiff\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u72b6\u6001\u63a8\u65ad\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u89c2\u6d4b\u63a8\u65ad\u5168\u5c40\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u514b\u670d\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u6b67\u4e49\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u72b6\u6001\u63a8\u65ad\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86GlobeDiff\u5728\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u5747\u6709\u754c\u3002\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGlobeDiff\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u63a8\u65ad\u5168\u5c40\u72b6\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "GlobeDiff\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u90fd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u72b6\u6001\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002"}}

However, most existing approaches fuse LoRA weights using static statistical heuristics that deviate from LoRA's original purpose of learning adaptive feature adjustments and ignore the randomness of sampled inputs. To address this, we propose a dynamic training-free fusion framework that operates throughout the generation process. During the forward pass, at each LoRA-applied layer, we dynamically compute the KL divergence between the base model's original features and those produced by subject and style LoRAs, respectively, and adaptively select the most appropriate weights for fusion. In the reverse denoising stage, we further refine the generation trajectory by dynamically applying gradient-based corrections derived from objective metrics such as CLIP and DINO scores, providing continuous semantic and stylistic guidance. By integrating these two complementary mechanisms-feature-level selection and metric-guided latent adjustment-across the entire diffusion timeline, our method dynamically achieves coherent subject-style synthesis without any retraining. Extensive experiments across diverse subject-style combinations demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LoRA fusion methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address these limitations, we introduce Obj-Disco, a framework that automatically decomposes an alignment reward signal into a sparse, weighted combination of human-interpretable natural language objectives. Our approach utilizes an iterative greedy algorithm to analyze behavioral changes across training checkpoints, identifying and validating candidate objectives that best explain the residual reward signal. Extensive evaluations across diverse tasks, model sizes, and alignment algorithms demonstrate the framework's robustness. Experiments with popular open-source reward models show that the framework consistently captures > 90% of reward behavior, a finding further corroborated by human evaluation. Additionally, a case study on alignment with an open-source reward model reveals that Obj-Disco can successfully identify latent misaligned incentives that emerge alongside intended behaviors.

However, there is limited guidance on when such simulations support valid inference about human behavior. We contrast two strategies for obtaining valid estimates of causal effects and clarify the assumptions under which each is suitable for exploratory versus confirmatory research. Heuristic approaches seek to establish that simulated and observed human behavior are interchangeable through prompt engineering, model fine-tuning, and other repair strategies designed to reduce LLM-induced inaccuracies. While useful for many exploratory tasks, heuristic approaches lack the formal statistical guarantees typically required for confirmatory research. In contrast, statistical calibration combines auxiliary human data with statistical adjustments to account for discrepancies between observed and simulated responses. Under explicit assumptions, statistical calibration preserves validity and provides more precise estimates of causal effects at lower cost than experiments that rely solely on human participants.

We find that internal Positive Attention Dynamics (PAD) in LVLMs naturally reveal semantically core visual regions under the distortions of attention sinks. Based on this, we propose Positive Attention Dynamics Enhancement (PADE), a training-free attention intervention that constructs a PAD map to identify semantically core visual regions, applies per-head Median Absolute Deviation Scaling to adaptively control the intervention strength, and leverages System-Token Compensation to maintain attention to complex user instructions and support long-term output consistency.

Conventional encoding methods (e.g., one-hot) often fail to convey the nuanced relationships among closely related subtypes, limiting AI's semantic comprehension. To address this limitation, this study proposes a novel training approach that employs large language model (LLM) embeddings (e.g., OpenAI GPT and Meta LLaMA) as encodings to preserve finer distinctions in building semantics. We evaluated the proposed method by training GraphSAGE models to classify 42 building object subtypes across five high-rise residential building information models (BIMs). Various embedding dimensions were tested, including original high-dimensional LLM embeddings (1,536, 3,072, or 4,096) and 1,024-dimensional compacted embeddings generated via the Matryoshka representation model. Experimental results demonstrated that LLM encodings outperformed the conventional one-hot baseline, with the llama-3 (compacted) embedding achieving a weighted average F1-score of 0.8766, compared to 0.8475 for one-hot encoding.

Inspired by structural principles of the cerebellum, we propose a biologically grounded RL architecture that incorporate large expansion, sparse connectivity, sparse activation, and dendritic-level modulation. Experiments on noisy, high-dimensional RL benchmarks show that both the cerebellar architecture and dendritic modulation consistently improve sample efficiency, robustness, and generalization compared to conventional designs.

Despite its privacy-preserving benefits, FL has significant drawbacks, including slow convergence, high communication cost, and non-independent-and-identically-distributed (non-IID) data. In this work, we present a novel FedAvg variation called Fractional-Order Federated Averaging (FOFedAvg), which incorporates Fractional-Order Stochastic Gradient Descent (FOSGD) to capture long-range relationships and deeper historical information. By introducing memory-aware fractional-order updates, FOFedAvg improves communication efficiency and accelerates convergence while mitigating instability caused by heterogeneous, non-IID client data. We compare FOFedAvg against a broad set of established federated optimization algorithms on benchmark datasets including MNIST, FEMNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, EMNIST, the Cleveland heart disease dataset, Sent140, PneumoniaMNIST, and Edge-IIoTset. Across a range of non-IID partitioning schemes, FOFedAvg is competitive with, and often outperforms, these baselines in terms of test performance and convergence speed. On the theoretical side, we prove that FOFedAvg converges to a stationary point under standard smoothness and bounded-variance assumptions for fractional order $0<\u03b1\\le 1$. Together, these results show that fractional-order, memory-aware updates can substantially improve the robustness and effectiveness of federated learning, offering a practical path toward distributed training on heterogeneous data.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We present Concept-Enhanced Multimodal RAG (CEMRAG), a unified framework that decomposes visual representations into interpretable clinical concepts and integrates them with multimodal RAG. This approach exploits enriched contextual prompts for RRG, improving both interpretability and factual accuracy. Experiments on MIMIC-CXR and IU X-Ray across multiple VLM architectures, training regimes, and retrieval configurations demonstrate consistent improvements over both conventional RAG and concept-only baselines on clinical accuracy metrics and standard NLP measures. These results challenge the assumed trade-off between interpretability and performance, showing that transparent visual concepts can enhance rather than compromise diagnostic accuracy in medical VLMs. Our modular design decomposes interpretability into visual transparency and structured language model conditioning, providing a principled pathway toward clinically trustworthy AI-assisted radiology.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Determining the correct ripeness level during the harvest period is crucial for both preventing losses for producers and ensuring consumers receive a quality product. However, traditional methods, i.e., visual assessments alone, can be subjective and have a high margin of error. Therefore, computer-assisted systems are needed. However, the scarcity of comprehensive datasets accessible to everyone in the literature makes it difficult to compare studies in this field. In this study, a new and publicly available strawberry ripeness dataset, consisting of 566 images and 1,201 labeled objects, prepared under variable light and environmental conditions in two different greenhouses in Turkey, is presented to the literature. Comparative tests conducted on the data set using YOLOv8, YOLOv9, and YOLO11-based models showed that the highest precision value was 90.94% in the YOLOv9c model, while the highest recall value was 83.74% in the YOLO11s model. In terms of the general performance criterion mAP@50, YOLOv8s was the best performing model with a success rate of 86.09%.

Standard approaches typically treat signal enhancement and classification as separate, sequential stages: first enhancing the signal and then applying a classifier. This approach fails to leverage the semantic information in the classifier's output during denoising. In this work, we propose a general, domain-agnostic framework that integrates two interacting diffusion models: one operating on the input signal and the other on the classifier's output logits, without requiring any retraining or fine-tuning of the classifier. This coupled formulation enables mutual guidance, where the enhancing signal refines the class estimation and, conversely, the evolving class logits guide the signal reconstruction towards discriminative regions of the manifold. We introduce three strategies to effectively model the joint distribution of the input and the logit. We evaluated our joint enhancement method for image classification and automatic speech recognition.

To ensure a concise evaluation of segmentation performance, we introduce a segmentation quality metric that serves as the objective function. Second, the pipeline optimizes design choices of a classifier, such as encoder and classifier head architectures, incorporation of prior knowledge, and pretraining strategies. To reduce manual annotation effort, this stage includes an assisted class-annotation workflow that extracts predicted instances from the segmentation results and sequentially presents them to the operator, eliminating the need for manual tracking.

Structure is recovered by predicting or enforcing domain-specific labels. This paradigm fails systematically under the conditions that make image-based science most valuable, including open-ended scientific discovery, cross-sensor and cross-site comparability, and long-term monitoring in which domain ontologies and associated label sets drift culturally, institutionally, and ecologically. A deductive inversion is proposed in the form of criteria-first and semantics-later. A unified framework for criteria-first structure discovery is introduced. It separates criterion-defined, semantics-free structure extraction from downstream semantic mapping into domain ontologies or vocabularies and provides a domain-general scaffold for reproducible analysis across image-based sciences. Reproducible science requires that the first analytic layer perform criterion-driven, semantics-free structure discovery, yielding stable partitions, structural fields, or hierarchies defined by explicit optimality criteria rather than local domain ontologies. Semantics is not discarded; it is relocated downstream as an explicit mapping from the discovered structural product to a domain ontology or vocabulary, enabling plural interpretations and explicit crosswalks without rewriting upstream extraction. Grounded in cybernetics, observation-as-distinction, and information theory's separation of information from meaning, the argument is supported by cross-domain evidence showing that criteria-first components recur whenever labels do not scale. Finally, consequences are outlined for validation beyond class accuracy and for treating structural products as FAIR, AI-ready digital objects for long-term monitoring and digital twins.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We ask whether an analogous conclusion holds approximately when the distributions are close instead of equal. Building on the observation of Nielsen et al. (2025) that closeness in KL divergence need not imply high linear representational similarity, we study a distributional distance based on logit differences and show that closeness in this distance does yield linear similarity guarantees. Specifically, we define a representational dissimilarity measure based on the models' identifiability class and prove that it is bounded by the logit distance. We further show that, when model probabilities are bounded away from zero, KL divergence upper-bounds logit distance; yet the resulting bound fails to provide nontrivial control in practice. As a consequence, KL-based distillation can match a teacher's predictions while failing to preserve linear representational properties, such as linear-probe recoverability of human-interpretable concepts.

Recent approaches increasingly employ large language models (LLMs) as high-level navigators due to their flexibility and reasoning capability. However, prompt-based LLM navigation often suffers from inefficient decision-making, as the model must repeatedly interpret instructions from scratch and reason over noisy and verbose navigable candidates at each step. In this paper, we propose a retrieval-augmented framework to improve the efficiency and stability of LLM-based VLN without modifying or fine-tuning the underlying language model. Our approach introduces retrieval at two complementary levels. At the episode level, an instruction-level embedding retriever selects semantically similar successful navigation trajectories as in-context exemplars, providing task-specific priors for instruction grounding. At the step level, an imitation-learned candidate retriever prunes irrelevant navigable directions before LLM inference, reducing action ambiguity and prompt complexity. Both retrieval modules are lightweight, modular, and trained independently of the LLM. We evaluate our method on the Room-to-Room (R2R) benchmark. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in Success Rate, Oracle Success Rate, and SPL on both seen and unseen environments. Ablation studies further show that instruction-level exemplar retrieval and candidate pruning contribute complementary benefits to global guidance and step-wise decision efficiency. These results indicate that retrieval-augmented decision support is an effective and scalable strategy for enhancing LLM-based vision-and-language navigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, the generalization of reasoning models is still vaguely defined and poorly understood. In this work, we present an evaluation framework to rigorously examine how well chain-of-thought (CoT) approaches generalize on a simple planning task. Specifically, we consider a grid-based navigation task in which a model is provided with a map and must output a sequence of moves that guides a player from a start position to a goal while avoiding obstacles. The versatility of the task and its data allows us to fine-tune model variants using different input representations (visual and textual) and CoT reasoning strategies, and systematically evaluate them under both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) test conditions. Our experiments show that, while CoT reasoning improves in-distribution generalization across all representations, out-of-distribution generalization (e.g., to larger maps) remains very limited in most cases when controlling for trivial matches with the ID data.

To promote synergy among the appearance, density, and feature fields, we construct a feature modulation module and distill language features from a 2D foundation model into our 3D scene model. In addition, we integrate geometric distillation into feature field distillation to transfer geometric knowledge from a geometry foundation model to our 3D scene representations via depth correlation regularization and pattern consistency regularization.

A principled way to enforce such behavior is to constrain the model's Lipschitz constant. However, approximation-theoretic guarantees for architectures that explicitly preserve Lipschitz continuity have yet to be established. In this work, we bridge this gap by introducing a class of gradient-descent-type in-context Transformers that are Lipschitz-continuous by construction. We realize both MLP and attention blocks as explicit Euler steps of negative gradient flows, ensuring inherent stability without sacrificing expressivity. We prove a universal approximation theorem for this class within a Lipschitz-constrained function space. Crucially, our analysis adopts a measure-theoretic formalism, interpreting Transformers as operators on probability measures, to yield approximation guarantees independent of token count.

To automate their analysis, numerous deep learning methods based on convolutional neural networks and Vision Transformers have been developed and have achieved strong performance in segmentation and classification tasks. However, due to the large size and complex cellular organization of WSIs, these models rely on patch-based representations, losing vital tissue-level context. We propose using scalable Graph Transformers on a full-WSI cell graph for classification. We evaluate this methodology on a challenging task: the classification of healthy versus tumor epithelial cells in cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC), where both cell types exhibit very similar morphologies and are therefore difficult to differentiate for image-based approaches. We first compared image-based and graph-based methods on a single WSI. Graph Transformer models SGFormer and DIFFormer achieved balanced accuracies of $85.2 \\pm 1.5$ ($\\pm$ standard error) and $85.1 \\pm 2.5$ in 3-fold cross-validation, respectively, whereas the best image-based method reached $81.2 \\pm 3.0$. By evaluating several node feature configurations, we found that the most informative representation combined morphological and texture features as well as the cell classes of non-epithelial cells, highlighting the importance of the surrounding cellular context. We then extended our work to train on several WSIs from several patients. To address the computational constraints of image-based models, we extracted four $2560 \\times 2560$ pixel patches from each image and converted them into graphs. In this setting, DIFFormer achieved a balanced accuracy of $83.6 \\pm 1.9$ (3-fold cross-validation), while the state-of-the-art image-based model CellViT256 reached $78.1 \\pm 0.5$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9488\u5bf9\u5168\u8f7d\u73bb\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5065\u5eb7\u4e0e\u80bf\u7624\u4e0a\u76ae\u7ec6\u80de\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e94\u7528\u56fe\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u4ece\u5168WSI\u7ec6\u80de\u56fe\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ea7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u8f7d\u73bb\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u764c\u75c7\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u5bcc\u542b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5377\u79ef\u6216\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5206\u7247\u8868\u793a\u800c\u4e22\u5931\u4e86\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ea7\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5728\u5f62\u6001\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u7ec6\u80de\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u5982cSCC\u4e2d\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u4e0e\u80bf\u7624\u4e0a\u76ae\u7ec6\u80de\uff09\u5206\u7c7b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u91c7\u7528\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u56fe\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08SGFormer\u548cDIFFormer\uff09\u5728\u5168WSI\u7ec6\u80de\u56fe\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u5f62\u6001\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u53ca\u975e\u4e0a\u76ae\u7ec6\u80de\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8282\u70b9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2aWSI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u53d62560\u00d72560\u50cf\u7d20\u5206\u7247\u5e76\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u56fe\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ee5\u514b\u670d\u8ba1\u7b97\u9650\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5355WSI\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cSGFormer\u548cDIFFormer\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5206\u522b\u4e3a85.2\u00b11.5\u548c85.1\u00b12.5\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u4f73\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u65b9\u6cd5\u768481.2\u00b13.0\u3002\u5728\u591aWSI\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cDIFFormer\u8fbe\u523083.6\u00b11.9\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e5f\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u6a21\u578bCellViT256\u768478.1\u00b10.5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56fe\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7ec6\u80de\u5f62\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5176\u6210\u529f\u4e3b\u8981\u5f97\u76ca\u4e8e\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ea7\u7ec6\u80de\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

However, such training risks models learning to obfuscate their deception to evade the detector. Prior work has studied obfuscation only in artificial settings where models were directly rewarded for harmful output. We construct a realistic coding environment where reward hacking via hardcoding test cases naturally occurs, and show that obfuscation emerges in this setting. We introduce a taxonomy of possible outcomes when training against a deception detector. The model either remains honest, or becomes deceptive via two possible obfuscation strategies. (i) Obfuscated activations: the model outputs deceptive text while modifying its internal representations to no longer trigger the detector. (ii) Obfuscated policy: the model outputs deceptive text that evades the detector, typically by including a justification for the reward hack. Empirically, obfuscated activations arise from representation drift during RL, with or without a detector penalty. The probe penalty only incentivizes obfuscated policies; we theoretically show this is expected for policy gradient methods. Sufficiently high KL regularization and detector penalty can yield honest policies, establishing white-box deception detectors as viable training signals for tasks prone to reward hacking.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u7f16\u7a0b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6297\u767d\u76d2\u6b3a\u9a97\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u4e09\u79cd\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a\u4fdd\u6301\u8bda\u5b9e\u3001\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u5f81\u5b9e\u73b0\u6b3a\u9a97\uff08\u6a21\u7cca\u5316\u6fc0\u6d3b\uff09\u3001\u901a\u8fc7\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u6587\u5b57\u8f93\u51fa\u5b9e\u73b0\u6b3a\u9a97\uff08\u6a21\u7cca\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6297\u767d\u76d2\u6b3a\u9a97\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u88ab\u63d0\u8bae\u4f5c\u4e3a\u786e\u4fddAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bda\u5b9e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u98ce\u9669\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u5b66\u4f1a\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u7cca\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u9003\u907f\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u4ec5\u5728\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u63a2\u8ba8\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u7f16\u7801\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7814\u7a76\u5956\u52b1\u653b\u51fb\u81ea\u7136\u53d1\u751f\u65f6\u6b3a\u9a97\u6a21\u7cca\u5316\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u7f16\u7a0b\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u786c\u7f16\u7801\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7528\u4f8b\u81ea\u7136\u5730\u51fa\u73b0\u5956\u52b1\u653b\u51fb\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u5bf9\u6b3a\u9a97\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a(1) \u6a21\u7cca\u5316\u6fc0\u6d3b\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u6f02\u79fb\u5bfc\u81f4\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u662f\u5426\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u60e9\u7f5a\u90fd\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\uff1b(2) \u6a21\u7cca\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u7531\u63a2\u6d4b\u60e9\u7f5a\u6fc0\u52b1\u4ea7\u751f\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u5305\u542b\u7406\u7531\u7b49\u65b9\u5f0f\u4f7f\u5176\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\u8f93\u51fa\u9003\u907f\u68c0\u6d4b\uff1b(3) \u8db3\u591f\u9ad8\u7684KL\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u60e9\u7f5a\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u8bda\u5b9e\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "conclusion": "\u767d\u76d2\u6b3a\u9a97\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u5728\u5bb9\u6613\u53d1\u751f\u5956\u52b1\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u6301\u8bda\u5b9e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u60e9\u7f5a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u6b3a\u9a97\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u8b66\u60d5\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u91c7\u53d6\u7684\u4e24\u79cd\u6b3a\u9a97\u6a21\u7cca\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce a new counterfactual inference approach tailored to time series data impacted by market events, which is motivated by an industrial application. Utilizing the abduction-action-prediction procedure and the Structural Causal Model framework, we first adapt methods based on variational autoencoders and adversarial autoencoders, both previously used in counterfactual literature although not in time series settings. Then, we present the Conditional Entropy-Penalized Autoencoder (CEPAE), a novel autoencoder-based approach for counterfactual inference, which employs an entropy penalization loss over the latent space to encourage disentangled data representations. We validate our approach both theoretically and experimentally on synthetic, semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets, showing that CEPAE generally outperforms the other approaches in the evaluated metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5CEPAE\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u5e02\u573a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u71b5\u60e9\u7f5a\u635f\u5931\u9f13\u52b1\u8868\u793a\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u5bf9\u4e8e\u91d1\u878d\u3001\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u5065\u548c\u8425\u9500\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u672c\u6587\u52a8\u673a\u6e90\u4e8e\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e02\u573a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6eaf\u56e0-\u884c\u52a8-\u9884\u6d4b\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002\u9996\u5148\u5c06\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u5bf9\u6297\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08\u5148\u524d\u672a\u7528\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff09\u9002\u914d\u5230\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u573a\u666f\u3002\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u6761\u4ef6\u71b5\u60e9\u7f5a\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08CEPAE\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u71b5\u60e9\u7f5a\u635f\u5931\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8868\u793a\u89e3\u8026\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5408\u6210\u3001\u534a\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aCEPAE\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u666e\u904d\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684CEPAE\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u5e02\u573a\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

However, most generative models treat sketches as static images, overlooking the temporal structure that underlies creative drawing. We present a data-efficient approach for sequential sketch generation that adapts pretrained text-to-video diffusion models to generate sketching processes. Our key insight is that large language models and video diffusion models offer complementary strengths for this task: LLMs provide semantic planning and stroke ordering, while video diffusion models serve as strong renderers that produce high-quality, temporally coherent visuals. We leverage this by representing sketches as short videos in which strokes are progressively drawn on a blank canvas, guided by text-specified ordering instructions. We introduce a two-stage fine-tuning strategy that decouples the learning of stroke ordering from the learning of sketch appearance. Stroke ordering is learned using synthetic shape compositions with controlled temporal structure, while visual appearance is distilled from as few as seven manually authored sketching processes that capture both global drawing order and the continuous formation of individual strokes. Despite the extremely limited amount of human-drawn sketch data, our method generates high-quality sequential sketches that closely follow text-specified orderings while exhibiting rich visual detail. We further demonstrate the flexibility of our approach through extensions such as brush style conditioning and autoregressive sketch generation, enabling additional controllability and interactive, collaborative drawing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u8349\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u914d\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6587\u751f\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u751f\u6210\u7ed8\u5236\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u8fdb\u884c\u8bed\u4e49\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u7b14\u5212\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6e32\u67d3\u5668\u4ea7\u751f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u8349\u56fe\u89c6\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u7ed8\u5236\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u800c\u8349\u56fe\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u6309\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u987a\u5e8f\u7ed8\u5236\u7b14\u5212\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u6355\u6349\u521b\u9020\u6027\u7ed8\u5236\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u5e8f\u8349\u56fe\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8349\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u7b14\u5212\u5728\u7a7a\u767d\u753b\u5e03\u4e0a\u9010\u6e10\u7ed8\u5236\u7684\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6587\u672c\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u6307\u4ee4\u6307\u5bfc\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u5177\u6709\u53d7\u63a7\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5f62\u72b6\u7ec4\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u7b14\u5212\u6392\u5e8f\uff1b2) \u4ece7\u4e2a\u4eba\u5de5\u7ed8\u5236\u7684\u8349\u56fe\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u89c6\u89c9\u5916\u89c2\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5168\u5c40\u7ed8\u5236\u987a\u5e8f\u548c\u5355\u4e2a\u7b14\u5212\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u5f62\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u4f7f\u7528\u6781\u5c11\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u7ed8\u5236\u7684\u8349\u56fe\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u8349\u56fe\uff0c\u7d27\u5bc6\u9075\u5faa\u6587\u672c\u6307\u5b9a\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c55\u73b0\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec6\u8282\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u901a\u8fc7\u753b\u7b14\u98ce\u683c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u548c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8349\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u6269\u5c55\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6587\u751f\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u4e8e\u65f6\u5e8f\u8349\u56fe\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u8349\u56fe\u7ed8\u5236\u8fc7\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

However, practical implementations face two key limitations: error signals must still propagate from the output to early layers through multiple inference-phase steps, and feedback decays exponentially during this process, leading to vanishing updates in early layers. We propose direct Kolen-Pollack predictive coding (DKP-PC), which simultaneously addresses both feedback delay and exponential decay, yielding a more efficient and scalable variant of PC while preserving update locality. Leveraging direct feedback alignment and direct Kolen-Pollack algorithms, DKP-PC introduces learnable feedback connections from the output layer to all hidden layers, establishing a direct pathway for error transmission. This yields an algorithm that reduces the theoretical error propagation time complexity from O(L), with L being the network depth, to O(1), removing depth-dependent delay in error signals.

Remarkably, RNNs differ from DNNs only by weight sharing, as can be shown through unrolling in time.

To address this question, we here develop a unified mean-field theory for RNNs and DNNs in terms of representational kernels, describing fully trained networks in the feature learning ($\u03bc$P) regime. This theory casts training as Bayesian inference over sequences and patterns, directly revealing the functional implications induced by the RNNs' weight sharing. In DNN-typical tasks, we identify a phase transition when the learning signal overcomes the noise due to randomness in the weights: below this threshold, RNNs and DNNs behave identically; above it, only RNNs develop correlated representations across timesteps. For sequential tasks, the RNNs' weight sharing furthermore induces an inductive bias that aids generalization by interpolating unsupervised time steps. Overall, our theory offers a way to connect architectural structure to functional biases.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This raises the following challenge: how can one establish formal unlearning guarantees when the mechanism depends on the specific point to be removed? To define individual data point sensitivities in noisy gradient dynamics, we consider the use of per-instance differential privacy.

The forward direction, i.e., computing output quantities from design parameters, typically requires running a numerical simulation, such as a FEM, as an intermediate step, which is an optimization problem by itself. In many scenarios, several design parameters can lead to the same or similar output values. For such cases, multi-modal probabilistic approaches are advantageous to obtain diverse solutions. A major difficulty in inverse design stems from the structure of the design space, since discrete parameters or further constraints disallow the direct use of gradient-based optimization. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel inverse design method based on diffusion models. Our approach relaxes the original design space into a continuous grid representation, where gradients can be computed by implicit differentiation in the forward simulation. A diffusion model is trained on this relaxed parameter space in order to serve as a prior for plausible relaxed designs. Parameters are sampled by guided diffusion using gradients that are propagated from an objective function specified at inference time through the differentiable simulation. A design sample is obtained by backprojection into the original parameter space. We develop our approach for a composite material design problem where the forward process is modeled as a linear FEM problem. We evaluate the performance of our approach in finding designs that match a specified bulk modulus. We demonstrate that our method can propose diverse designs within 1% relative error margin from medium to high target bulk moduli in 2D and 3D settings.

Accurately identifying the PDE model, which represents the underlying physical law, is essential for a proper understanding of the problem.

In this work, we address this issue by considering existing neural network architectures based on rational functions for the symbolic representation of physical laws. These networks leverage the approximation power of rational functions while also benefiting from their flexibility in representing arithmetic operations. Our main contribution is an identifiability result, showing that, in the limit of noiseless, complete measurements, such symbolic networks can uniquely reconstruct the simplest physical law within the PDE model. Specifically, reconstructed laws remain expressible within the symbolic network architecture, with regularization-minimizing parameterizations promoting interpretability and sparsity in case of $L^1$-regularization.

We formalize this bias and propose a \\emph{Stratified Stress-Test} that partitions evaluation into Stationary and Transient regimes. Using Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) as a testbed -- chosen for its rigorous ground-truth forcing functions (meals, insulin) that enable precise regime identification -- we establish three findings with broad implications:(i)~Stationary Efficiency: Linear interpolation achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction during stable intervals, confirming that complex architectures are computationally wasteful in low-entropy regimes.(ii)~Transient Fidelity: During critical transients (post-prandial peaks, hypoglycemic events), linear methods exhibit drastically degraded morphological fidelity (DTW), disproportionate to their RMSE -- a phenomenon we term the \\emph{RMSE Mirage}, where low pointwise error masks the destruction of signal shape.(iii)~Regime-Conditional Model Selection: Deep learning models preserve both pointwise accuracy and morphological integrity during transients, making them essential for safety-critical downstream tasks.

We model regions as nodes on a graph, which enables a random walk-based procedure to form \"sequences of regions\" that reflect both local and neighborhood structural features for urban region representation learning. For cross-task generalization, we propose a cross-task learning module named HCondDiffCT. This module integrates region-conditioned prior knowledge and task-conditioned semantics into the diffusion process to jointly model multiple downstream urban prediction tasks. HCondDiffCT is generic. It can also be integrated with existing urban representation learning models to enhance their downstream task effectiveness. Experiments on real-world datasets show that UrbanVerse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across six tasks under cross-city settings, achieving up to 35.89% improvements in prediction accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, this objective creates an imbalance, where some users receive far too many matches while many others receive very few and eventually abandon the platform. Retaining users is crucial for many platforms, such as those that depend heavily on subscriptions. Some may use fairness objectives to solve the problem of match maximization. However, fairness in itself is not the ultimate objective for many platforms, as users do not suddenly reward the platform simply because exposure is equalized. In practice, where user retention is often the ultimate goal, casually relying on fairness will leave the optimization of retention up to luck.\n  In this work, instead of maximizing matches or axiomatically defining fairness, we formally define the new problem setting of maximizing user retention in two-sided matching platforms. To this end, we introduce a dynamic learning-to-rank (LTR) algorithm called Matching for Retention (MRet). Unlike conventional algorithms for two-sided matching, our approach models user retention by learning personalized retention curves from each user's profile and interaction history. Based on these curves, MRet dynamically adapts recommendations by jointly considering the retention gains of both the user receiving recommendations and those who are being recommended, so that limited matching opportunities can be allocated where they most improve overall retention. Naturally but importantly, empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets from a major online dating platform show that MRet achieves higher user retention, since conventional methods optimize matches or fairness rather than retention.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We show that the prevailing explanation, that fine-tuning updates should be orthogonal to safety-critical directions in high-dimensional parameter space, offers false reassurance: we show this orthogonality is structurally unstable and collapses under the dynamics of gradient descent. We then resolve this through a novel geometric analysis, proving that alignment concentrates in low-dimensional subspaces with sharp curvature, creating a brittle structure that first-order methods cannot detect or defend. While initial fine-tuning updates may indeed avoid these subspaces, the curvature of the fine-tuning loss generates second-order acceleration that systematically steers trajectories into alignment-sensitive regions. We formalize this mechanism through the Alignment Instability Condition, three geometric properties that, when jointly satisfied, lead to safety degradation. Our main result establishes a quartic scaling law: alignment loss grows with the fourth power of training time, governed by the sharpness of alignment geometry and the strength of curvature coupling between the fine-tuning task and safety-critical parameters. These results expose a structural blind spot in the current safety paradigm. The dominant approaches to safe fine-tuning address only the initial snapshot of a fundamentally dynamic problem. Alignment fragility is not a bug to be patched; it is an intrinsic geometric property of gradient descent on curved manifolds. Our results motivate the development of curvature-aware methods, and we hope will further enable a shift in alignment safety analysis from reactive red-teaming to predictive diagnostics for open-weight model deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The project page can be found at https://oswinso.xyz/fge", "summary": "Recent advances in deep reinforcement learning (RL) have achieved strong results on high-dimensional control tasks, but applying RL to reachability problems raises a fundamental mismatch: reachability seeks to maximize the set of states from which a system remains safe indefinitely, while RL optimizes expected returns over a user-specified distribution. This mismatch can result in policies that perform poorly on low-probability states that are still within the safe set. A natural alternative is to frame the problem as a robust optimization over a set of initial conditions that specify the initial state, dynamics and safe set, but whether this problem has a solution depends on the feasibility of the specified set, which is unknown a priori. We propose Feasibility-Guided Exploration (FGE), a method that simultaneously identifies a subset of feasible initial conditions under which a safe policy exists, and learns a policy to solve the reachability problem over this set of initial conditions. Empirical results demonstrate that FGE learns policies with over 50% more coverage than the best existing method for challenging initial conditions across tasks in the MuJoCo simulator and the Kinetix simulator with pixel observations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faFeasibility-Guided Exploration (FGE)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u96c6\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u884c\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u5b50\u96c6\u53ca\u76f8\u5e94\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4efb\u52a1\u8986\u76d6\u7387", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff1a\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u8ffd\u6c42\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fdd\u6301\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u800c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u662f\u7528\u6237\u6307\u5b9a\u5206\u5e03\u4e0a\u7684\u671f\u671b\u56de\u62a5", "method": "FGE\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u65f6\u8bc6\u522b\u5b58\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5b66\u4e60\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8be5\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u96c6\u7684\u96c6\u5408\u4e0a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u4f18\u5316", "result": "\u5728MuJoCo\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548cKinetix\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u89c2\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cFGE\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u6bd4\u4ee5\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8650%\u4ee5\u4e0a", "conclusion": "FGE\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u53ef\u884c\u96c6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86RL\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u53ef\u8fbe\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u8303\u56f4"}}

The SAH, however, lacks a precise definition, which has led to (i) different and seemingly orthogonal arguments supporting it, and (ii) important critiques to it. We propose a new metric called task complexity: the length of the shortest program that achieves a target performance on a task. In this framework, the SAH simply claims that pre-trained models drastically reduce the complexity of achieving high performance on many tasks. Our definition unifies prior arguments supporting the SAH, interpreting them as different strategies to find such short programs. Experimentally, we estimate the task complexity of mathematical reasoning, machine translation, and instruction following; we then show that these complexities can be remarkably low when conditioned on a pre-trained model. Further, we find that pre-training enables access to strong performances on our tasks, but it can require programs of gigabytes of length to access them. Post-training, on the other hand, collapses the complexity of reaching this same performance by several orders of magnitude. Overall, our results highlight that task adaptation often requires surprisingly little information -- often just a few kilobytes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
