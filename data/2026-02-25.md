TL;DR: 为解决MLLMs中冗余视觉token带来的高推理成本问题，本文提出一种基于最优传输的无训练剪枝框架OTPrune，通过分布对齐保留语义信息，实现性能与效率的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉token剪枝方法忽略了视觉表征的分布结构，导致信息损失或效率不足。为减少多模态大语言模型推理成本同时保持语义准确性，需要一种能同时考虑局部多样性和全局代表性的剪枝方法。

Method: 提出OTPrune框架，将剪枝问题建模为通过最优传输进行分布对齐，最小化完整token与剪枝后token分布的2-Wasserstein距离，并推导出可处理的次模目标函数实现高效优化。

Result: 在广泛基准测试中，OTPrune相比现有方法实现了更优的性能-效率权衡，理论证明了方法的单调性和次模性，确保了剪枝的稳定性。

Conclusion: OTPrune通过分布对齐实现了高效且语义忠实的视觉token剪枝，为多模态大语言模型的加速推理提供了理论基础和实践框架。代码已开源。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) achieve strong visual-language reasoning but suffer from high inference cost due to redundant visual tokens. Recent work explores visual token pruning to accelerate inference, while existing pruning methods overlook the underlying distributional structure of visual representations. We propose OTPrune, a training-free framework that formulates pruning as distribution alignment via optimal transport (OT). By minimizing the 2-Wasserstein distance between the full and pruned token distributions, OTPrune preserves both local diversity and global representativeness while reducing inference cost. Moreover, we derive a tractable submodular objective that enables efficient optimization, and theoretically prove its monotonicity and submodularity, providing a principled foundation for stable and efficient pruning. We further provide a comprehensive analysis that explains how distributional alignment contributes to stable and semantically faithful pruning. Comprehensive experiments on wider benchmarks demonstrate that OTPrune achieves superior performance-efficiency tradeoffs compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Inverse problems in imaging are ill-posed, leading to infinitely many solutions consistent with the measurements due to the non-trivial null-space of the sensing matrix. Common image priors promote solutions on the general image manifold, such as sparsity, smoothness, or score function. However, as these priors do not constrain the null-space component, they can bias the reconstruction. Thus, we aim to incorporate meaningful null-space information in the reconstruction framework. Inspired by smooth image representation on graphs, we propose Graph-Smooth Null-Space Representation (GSNR), a mechanism that imposes structure only into the invisible component. Particularly, given a graph Laplacian, we construct a null-restricted Laplacian that encodes similarity between neighboring pixels in the null-space signal, and we design a low-dimensional projection matrix from the $p$-smoothest spectral graph modes (lowest graph frequencies). This approach has strong theoretical and practical implications: i) improved convergence via a null-only graph regularizer, ii) better coverage, how much null-space variance is captured by $p$ modes, and iii) high predictability, how well these modes can be inferred from the measurements. GSNR is incorporated into well-known inverse problem solvers, e.g., PnP, DIP, and diffusion solvers, in four scenarios: image deblurring, compressed sensing, demosaicing, and image super-resolution, providing consistent improvement of up to 4.3 dB over baseline formulations and up to 1 dB compared with end-to-end learned models in terms of PSNR.

Abstract: Data visualizations are central to scientific communication, journalism, and everyday decision-making, yet they are frequently prone to errors that can distort interpretation or mislead audiences. Rule-based visualization linters can flag violations, but they miss context and do not suggest meaningful design changes. Directly querying general-purpose LLMs about visualization quality is unreliable: lacking training to follow visualization design principles, they often produce inconsistent or incorrect feedback. In this work, we introduce a framework that combines chart de-rendering, automated analysis, and iterative improvement to deliver actionable, interpretable feedback on visualization design. Our system reconstructs the structure of a chart from an image, identifies design flaws using vision-language reasoning, and proposes concrete modifications supported by established principles in visualization research. Users can selectively apply these improvements and re-render updated figures, creating a feedback loop that promotes both higher-quality visualizations and the development of visualization literacy. In our evaluation on 1,000 charts from the Chart2Code benchmark, the system generated 10,452 design recommendations, which clustered into 10 coherent categories (e.g., axis formatting, color accessibility, legend consistency). These results highlight the promise of LLM-driven recommendation systems for delivering structured, principle-based feedback on visualization design, opening the door to more intelligent and accessible authoring tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）功能强大但不透明，需要系统化的方法来分析其多模态推理机制，为构建更可解释、可靠的VLMs奠定基础。

Method: 利用转码器、归因图和基于注意力的方法，设计了电路追踪框架，通过特征导向和电路修补来验证电路结构。

Result: 发现VLMs中存在处理数学推理的视觉特征电路和跨模态关联电路，这些电路具有因果性和可控性。

Conclusion: 该框架为系统分析VLMs的内部工作机制提供了有效工具，证明了视觉-语义概念的分层整合机制，推动了可解释性VLMs的发展。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are powerful but remain opaque black boxes. We introduce the first framework for transparent circuit tracing in VLMs to systematically analyze multimodal reasoning. By utilizing transcoders, attribution graphs, and attention-based methods, we uncover how VLMs hierarchically integrate visual and semantic concepts. We reveal that distinct visual feature circuits can handle mathematical reasoning and support cross-modal associations. Validated through feature steering and circuit patching, our framework proves these circuits are causal and controllable, laying the groundwork for more explainable and reliable VLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机广泛用于实时空中感知，3D高斯溅射在实时神经渲染中显示出潜力，但将其集成到端到端无人机重建与可视化系统中的研究不足。目标是提出一个结合实时视频获取、同步传感器融合、相机姿态估计和3DGS优化的高效架构。

Abstract: In this study, we present an end-to-end pipeline capable of converting drone-captured video streams into high-fidelity 3D reconstructions with minimal latency. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are extensively used in aerial real-time perception applications. Moreover, recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated significant potential for real-time neural rendering. However, their integration into end-to-end UAV-based reconstruction and visualization systems remains underexplored. Our goal is to propose an efficient architecture that combines live video acquisition via RTMP streaming, synchronized sensor fusion, camera pose estimation, and 3DGS optimization, achieving continuous model updates and low-latency deployment within interactive visualization environments that supports immersive augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) applications. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive visual fidelity, while delivering significantly higher rendering performance and substantially reduced end-to-end latency, compared to NeRF-based approaches. Reconstruction quality remains within 4-7\% of high-fidelity offline references, confirming the suitability of the proposed system for real-time, scalable augmented perception from aerial platforms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了BiRQA，一种双向多尺度金字塔处理四种快速互补特征的紧凑型FR IQA度量模型，通过包含自下而上注意力模块和自上而下的交叉门控模块，结合锚定对抗训练提升鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前神经FR IQA指标速度慢且易受对抗扰动攻击，需要设计兼具准确性、实时性和强大对抗鲁棒性的全参考图像质量评估模型。

Method: BiRQA使用双向多尺度金字塔处理快速互补特征，自下而上注入精细尺度线索到粗粒度层次，自上而下路由语义上下文到高分辨率。采用理论支持的锚定对抗训练策略，使用干净锚点样本和排序损失来限制对抗攻击下的逐点预测误差。

Result: 在五个公共FR IQA基准测试中优于或追平之前SOTA，运行速度比之前SOTA快约3倍。在未知白盒攻击下，KADID-10k上的SROCC从0.30-0.57提升到0.60-0.84，显著提高鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BiRQA是目前唯一将竞争性精度与实时吞吐量和强大对抗鲁棒性相结合的FR IQA模型。

Abstract: Full-Reference image quality assessment (FR IQA) is important for image compression, restoration and generative modeling, yet current neural metrics remain slow and vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. We present BiRQA, a compact FR IQA metric model that processes four fast complementary features within a bidirectional multiscale pyramid. A bottom-up attention module injects fine-scale cues into coarse levels through an uncertainty-aware gate, while a top-down cross-gating block routes semantic context back to high resolution. To enhance robustness, we introduce Anchored Adversarial Training, a theoretically grounded strategy that uses clean "anchor" samples and a ranking loss to bound pointwise prediction error under attacks. On five public FR IQA benchmarks BiRQA outperforms or matches the previous state of the art (SOTA) while running ~3x faster than previous SOTA models. Under unseen white-box attacks it lifts SROCC from 0.30-0.57 to 0.60-0.84 on KADID-10k, demonstrating substantial robustness gains. To our knowledge, BiRQA is the only FR IQA model combining competitive accuracy with real-time throughput and strong adversarial resilience.

Abstract: AI video generation is evolving rapidly. For video generators to be useful for applications ranging from robotics to film-making, they must consistently produce realistic videos. However, evaluating the realism of generated videos remains a largely manual process -- requiring human annotation or bespoke evaluation datasets which have restricted scope. Here we develop an automated evaluation framework for video realism which captures both semantics and coherent 3D structure and which does not require access to a reference video. Our method, 3DSPA, is a 3D spatiotemporal point autoencoder which integrates 3D point trajectories, depth cues, and DINO semantic features into a unified representation for video evaluation. 3DSPA models how objects move and what is happening in the scene, enabling robust assessments of realism, temporal consistency, and physical plausibility. Experiments show that 3DSPA reliably identifies videos which violate physical laws, is more sensitive to motion artifacts, and aligns more closely with human judgments of video quality and realism across multiple datasets. Our results demonstrate that enriching trajectory-based representations with 3D semantics offers a stronger foundation for benchmarking generative video models, and implicitly captures physical rule violations. The code and pretrained model weights will be available at https://github.com/TheProParadox/3dspa_code.

Motivation: 当前AI生成图像检测方法大多过拟合训练数据，在面对分布偏移的硬测试集时性能严重下降，需要更原则性的检测方法。

Result: 在Chameleon基准测试上，性能提升达+24.85%准确率和+69.62%召回率，训练速度比现有方法快数个数量级。

Conclusion: SimLBR通过更原则性的边界学习框架显著提升了伪造图像检测的泛化能力和效率，同时强调需要可靠性导向的评估指标来更好评估模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has made the detection of AI-generated images a critical challenge for both research and society. Recent works have shown that most state-of-the-art fake image detection methods overfit to their training data and catastrophically fail when evaluated on curated hard test sets with strong distribution shifts. In this work, we argue that it is more principled to learn a tight decision boundary around the real image distribution and treat the fake category as a sink class. To this end, we propose SimLBR, a simple and efficient framework for fake image detection using Latent Blending Regularization (LBR). Our method significantly improves cross-generator generalization, achieving up to +24.85\% accuracy and +69.62\% recall on the challenging Chameleon benchmark. SimLBR is also highly efficient, training orders of magnitude faster than existing approaches. Furthermore, we emphasize the need for reliability-oriented evaluation in fake image detection, introducing risk-adjusted metrics and worst-case estimates to better assess model robustness. All code and models will be released on HuggingFace and GitHub.

Abstract: Capturing high-quality images from only a few detected photons is a fundamental challenge in computational imaging. Single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) sensors promise high-quality imaging in regimes where conventional cameras fail, but raw \emph{quanta frames} contain only sparse, noisy, binary photon detections. Recovering a coherent image from a burst of such frames requires handling alignment, denoising, and demosaicing (for color) under noise statistics far outside those assumed by standard restoration pipelines or modern generative models. We present an approach that adapts large text-to-image latent diffusion models to the photon-limited domain of quanta burst imaging. Our method leverages the structural and semantic priors of internet-scale diffusion models while introducing mechanisms to handle Bernoulli photon statistics. By integrating latent-space restoration with burst-level spatio-temporal reasoning, our approach produces reconstructions that are both photometrically faithful and perceptually pleasing, even under high-speed motion. We evaluate the method on synthetic benchmarks and new real-world datasets, including the first color SPAD burst dataset and a challenging \textit{Deforming (XD)} video benchmark. Across all settings, the approach substantially improves perceptual quality over classical and modern learning-based baselines, demonstrating the promise of adapting large generative priors to extreme photon-limited sensing.

Motivation: 医学图像分割面临标注数据有限、解剖特征模糊和域偏移等挑战，现有视觉语言模型在密集、文本引导的医学图像分割方面潜力未被充分挖掘。

Method: 提出MedCLIPSeg框架，通过概率跨模态注意力实现图像与文本标记的双向交互，结合软补丁级对比损失增强跨文本提示的语义学习，并显式建模预测不确定性。

Result: 在16个数据集（涵盖5种成像模态和6个器官）的实验中，MedCLIPSeg在准确性、效率和鲁棒性方面优于现有方法，并提供可解释的不确定性图。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了概率视觉语言建模在文本驱动医学图像分割中的潜力，为数据高效、域泛化的医学图像分割提供了新思路。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation remains challenging due to limited annotations for training, ambiguous anatomical features, and domain shifts. While vision-language models such as CLIP offer strong cross-modal representations, their potential for dense, text-guided medical image segmentation remains underexplored. We present MedCLIPSeg, a novel framework that adapts CLIP for robust, data-efficient, and uncertainty-aware medical image segmentation. Our approach leverages patch-level CLIP embeddings through probabilistic cross-modal attention, enabling bidirectional interaction between image and text tokens and explicit modeling of predictive uncertainty. Together with a soft patch-level contrastive loss that encourages more nuanced semantic learning across diverse textual prompts, MedCLIPSeg effectively improves data efficiency and domain generalizability. Extensive experiments across 16 datasets spanning five imaging modalities and six organs demonstrate that MedCLIPSeg outperforms prior methods in accuracy, efficiency, and robustness, while providing interpretable uncertainty maps that highlight local reliability of segmentation results. This work demonstrates the potential of probabilistic vision-language modeling for text-driven medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Synthesizing text-driven 3D human motion within realistic scenes requires learning both semantic intent ("walk to the couch") and physical feasibility (e.g., avoiding collisions). Current methods use generative frameworks that simultaneously learn high-level planning and low-level contact reasoning, and rely on computationally expensive 3D scene data such as point clouds or voxel occupancy grids. We propose SceMoS, a scene-aware motion synthesis framework that shows that structured 2D scene representations can serve as a powerful alternative to full 3D supervision in physically grounded motion synthesis. SceMoS disentangles global planning from local execution using lightweight 2D cues and relying on (1) a text-conditioned autoregressive global motion planner that operates on a bird's-eye-view (BEV) image rendered from an elevated corner of the scene, encoded with DINOv2 features, as the scene representation, and (2) a geometry-grounded motion tokenizer trained via a conditional VQ-VAE, that uses 2D local scene heightmap, thus embedding surface physics directly into a discrete vocabulary. This 2D factorization reaches an efficiency-fidelity trade-off: BEV semantics capture spatial layout and affordance for global reasoning, while local heightmaps enforce fine-grained physical adherence without full 3D volumetric reasoning. SceMoS achieves state-of-the-art motion realism and contact accuracy on the TRUMANS benchmark, reducing the number of trainable parameters for scene encoding by over 50%, showing that 2D scene cues can effectively ground 3D human-scene interaction.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种双曲流匹配方法来解决跨模态少样本适配中的流路径纠缠问题，通过双曲空间的结构优势实现视觉-语义特征的更好对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于欧几里得几何的流匹配方法在平坦几何中存在局限性，其多项式体积增长难以适应多样的特征分布，导致严重的路径纠缠问题。这阻碍了跨模态少样本学习中的视觉-语义对齐效果。

Method: 方法的核心是路径解耦的双曲流匹配。包含两个关键技术：向心双曲对齐（基于文本根节点构建向心层次结构，将视觉叶节点推向边界以初始化有序流）、路径解耦目标（作为“语义护栏”通过逐步监督将轨迹严格限制在隔离的类别特定测地线走廊内）。此外还设计了自适应直径停止机制防止过度传输到拥挤的源区域。

Result: 在11个基准测试上的广泛消融实验表明，HFM建立了新的最先进水平，持续优于其欧几里得对应方法。

Conclusion: 论文通过利用双曲流匹配解决了跨模态少样本适配中的路径纠缠问题，证明双曲空间的指数扩展特性能够提供更有效的特征传输机制，为领域发展提供了重要贡献。

Abstract: Recent advances in cross-modal few-shot adaptation treat visual-semantic alignment as a continuous feature transport problem via Flow Matching (FM). However, we argue that Euclidean-based FM overlooks fundamental limitations of flat geometry, where polynomial volume growth fails to accommodate diverse feature distributions, leading to severe path entanglement. To this end, we propose path-decoupled Hyperbolic Flow Matching (HFM), leveraging the Lorentz manifold's exponential expansion for trajectory decoupling. HFM structures the transport via two key designs: 1) Centripetal hyperbolic alignment: It constructs a centripetal hierarchy by anchoring textual roots, which pushes visual leaves to the boundary to initialize orderly flows. 2) Path-decoupled objective: It acts as a ``semantic guardrail'' rigidly confining trajectories within isolated class-specific geodesic corridors via step-wise supervision. Furthermore, we devise an adaptive diameter-based stopping to prevent over-transportation into the crowded origin based on the intrinsic semantic scale. Extensive ablations on 11 benchmarks have shown that HFM establishes a new state-of-the-art, consistently outperforming its Euclidean counterparts. Our codes and models will be released.

Conclusion: PipStereo实现了边缘设备上高精度实时立体匹配，为嵌入式视觉应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: While iterative stereo matching achieves high accuracy, its dependence on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) hinders edge deployment, a challenge underexplored in existing researches. We analyze iterative refinement and reveal that disparity updates are spatially sparse and temporally redundant. First, we introduce a progressive iteration pruning strategy that suppresses redundant update steps, effectively collapsing the recursive computation into a near-single-pass inference. Second, we propose a collaborative monocular prior transfer framework that implicitly embeds depth priors without requiring a dedicated monocular encoder, thereby eliminating its associated computational burden. Third, we develop FlashGRU, a hardware-aware RNN operator leveraging structured sparsity and I/O-conscious design, achieving a 7.28$\times$ speedup, 76.6\% memory peak reduction and 80.9\% global memory requests reduction over natvie ConvGRUs under 2K resolution. Our PipStereo enables real-time, high-fidelity stereo matching on edge hardware: it processes 320$\times$640 frames in just 75ms on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX (FP16) and 19ms on RTX 4090, matching the accuracy of large iterative based models, and our generalization ability and accuracy far exceeds that of existing real-time methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: What does it mean for a visual system to truly understand affordance? We argue that this understanding hinges on two complementary capacities: geometric perception, which identifies the structural parts of objects that enable interaction, and interaction perception, which models how an agent's actions engage with those parts. To test this hypothesis, we conduct a systematic probing of Visual Foundation Models (VFMs). We find that models like DINO inherently encode part-level geometric structures, while generative models like Flux contain rich, verb-conditioned spatial attention maps that serve as implicit interaction priors. Crucially, we demonstrate that these two dimensions are not merely correlated but are composable elements of affordance. By simply fusing DINO's geometric prototypes with Flux's interaction maps in a training-free and zero-shot manner, we achieve affordance estimation competitive with weakly-supervised methods. This final fusion experiment confirms that geometric and interaction perception are the fundamental building blocks of affordance understanding in VFMs, providing a mechanistic account of how perception grounds action.

Abstract: We study how visual artifacts introduced by diffusion-based inpainting affect language generation in vision-language models. We use a two-stage diagnostic setup in which masked image regions are reconstructed and then provided to captioning models, enabling controlled comparisons between captions generated from original and reconstructed inputs. Across multiple datasets, we analyze the relationship between reconstruction fidelity and downstream caption quality. We observe consistent associations between pixel-level and perceptual reconstruction metrics and both lexical and semantic captioning performance. Additional analysis of intermediate visual representations and attention patterns shows that inpainting artifacts lead to systematic, layer-dependent changes in model behavior. Together, these results provide a practical diagnostic framework for examining how visual reconstruction quality influences language generation in multimodal systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: App ratings are among the most significant indicators of the quality, usability, and overall user satisfaction of mobile applications. However, existing app rating prediction models are largely limited to textual data or user interface (UI) features, overlooking the importance of jointly leveraging UI and semantic information. To address these limitations, this study proposes a lightweight vision--language framework that integrates both mobile UI and semantic information for app rating prediction. The framework combines MobileNetV3 to extract visual features from UI layouts and DistilBERT to extract textual features. These multimodal features are fused through a gated fusion module with Swish activations, followed by a multilayer perceptron (MLP) regression head. The proposed model is evaluated using mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean squared error (MSE), coefficient of determination (R2), and Pearson correlation. After training for 20 epochs, the model achieves an MAE of 0.1060, an RMSE of 0.1433, an MSE of 0.0205, an R2 of 0.8529, and a Pearson correlation of 0.9251. Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of different combinations of visual and textual encoders. Overall, the proposed lightweight framework provides valuable insights for developers and end users, supports sustainable app development, and enables efficient deployment on edge devices.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal predictive learning (STPL) aims to forecast future frames from past observations and is essential across a wide range of applications. Compared with recurrent or hybrid architectures, pure convolutional models offer superior efficiency and full parallelism, yet their fixed receptive fields limit their ability to adaptively capture spatially varying motion patterns. Inspired by biological center-surround organization and frequency-selective signal processing, we propose PFGNet, a fully convolutional framework that dynamically modulates receptive fields through pixel-wise frequency-guided gating. The core Peripheral Frequency Gating (PFG) block extracts localized spectral cues and adaptively fuses multi-scale large-kernel peripheral responses with learnable center suppression, effectively forming spatially adaptive band-pass filters. To maintain efficiency, all large kernels are decomposed into separable 1D convolutions ($1 \times k$ followed by $k \times 1$), reducing per-channel computational cost from $O(k^2)$ to $O(2k)$. PFGNet enables structure-aware spatiotemporal modeling without recurrence or attention. Experiments on Moving MNIST, TaxiBJ, Human3.6M, and KTH show that PFGNet delivers SOTA or near-SOTA forecasting performance with substantially fewer parameters and FLOPs.

TL;DR: 针对制药环境中菌落形成单位（CFU）检测的需求，研究结合深度学习与视觉语言模型构建多智能体框架，以提升检测准确性和自动化水平，满足药品生产质量监管要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 制药行业的环境监测项目对菌落形成单位（CFU）检测有严格要求，传统人工计数费时易错，而现有深度学习方法虽然提高了准确性，但面对样品质量变化和伪影时性能下降，仍需达到制药级标准的高准确率。

Method: 研究评估了YOLOv5、YOLOv7、YOLOv8等模型，并基于GSK超过5万张培养皿图像数据集训练定制Detectron2模型，最终构建了结合深度学习和视觉语言模型（VLM）的多智能体框架：VLM智能体首先对培养皿进行有效/无效分类；对有效样本，深度学习和VLM智能体各自独立估计菌落数量；若两者预测结果差异在5%以内，则自动记录至数据库；否则交由专家审核，专家反馈用于持续模型再训练和系统自我优化。

Result: 定制Detectron2模型达到了99%的检测率、2%的假阳性率和0.6%的假阴性率，但面对污染培养皿、塑料伪影或光学清晰度差等异常情况时性能下降。初步的深度学习自动化使疫苗生产基地的人工核查减少了50%；结合VLM后，这一比例提升至85%，带来了显著的操作成本节约。

Conclusion: 提出的多智能体系统为微生物质量控制提供了可扩展、可审计且符合监管要求的解决方案，推进了生物制药生产自动化进程，通过结合深度学习与视觉语言模型，有效提升了检测准确性和自动化效率，同时利用专家反馈实现持续自我改进。

Abstract: Colony-forming unit (CFU) detection is critical in pharmaceutical manufacturing, serving as a key component of Environmental Monitoring programs and ensuring compliance with stringent quality standards. Manual counting is labor-intensive and error-prone, while deep learning (DL) approaches, though accurate, remain vulnerable to sample quality variations and artifacts. Building on our earlier CNN-based framework (Beznik et al., 2020), we evaluated YOLOv5, YOLOv7, and YOLOv8 for CFU detection; however, these achieved only 97.08 percent accuracy, insufficient for pharmaceutical-grade requirements. A custom Detectron2 model trained on GSK's dataset of over 50,000 Petri dish images achieved 99 percent detection rate with 2 percent false positives and 0.6 percent false negatives. Despite high validation accuracy, Detectron2 performance degrades on outlier cases including contaminated plates, plastic artifacts, or poor optical clarity. To address this, we developed a multi-agent framework combining DL with vision-language models (VLMs). The VLM agent first classifies plates as valid or invalid. For valid samples, both DL and VLM agents independently estimate colony counts. When predictions align within 5 percent, results are automatically recorded in Postgres and SAP; otherwise, samples are routed for expert review. Expert feedback enables continuous retraining and self-improvement. Initial DL-based automation reduced human verification by 50 percent across vaccine manufacturing sites. With VLM integration, this increased to 85 percent, delivering significant operational savings. The proposed system provides a scalable, auditable, and regulation-ready solution for microbiological quality control, advancing automation in biopharmaceutical production.

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a promising paradigm for energy-efficient neuromorphic computing due to their bio-plausible and spike-driven characteristics. However, the robustness of SNNs in complex adversarial environments remains significantly constrained. In this study, we theoretically demonstrate that those threshold-neighboring spiking neurons are the key factors limiting the robustness of directly trained SNNs. We find that these neurons set the upper limits for the maximum potential strength of adversarial attacks and are prone to state-flipping under minor disturbances. To address this challenge, we propose a Threshold Guarding Optimization (TGO) method, which comprises two key aspects. First, we incorporate additional constraints into the loss function to move neurons' membrane potentials away from their thresholds. It increases SNNs' gradient sparsity, thereby reducing the theoretical upper bound of adversarial attacks. Second, we introduce noisy spiking neurons to transition the neuronal firing mechanism from deterministic to probabilistic, decreasing their state-flipping probability due to minor disturbances. Extensive experiments conducted in standard adversarial scenarios prove that our method significantly enhances the robustness of directly trained SNNs. These findings pave the way for advancing more reliable and secure neuromorphic computing in real-world applications.

Abstract: Computational imaging forward models, from coded aperture spectral cameras to MRI scanners, are traditionally implemented as monolithic, modality-specific codes. We prove that every forward model in a broad, precisely defined operator class Cimg (encompassing clinical, scientific, and industrial imaging modalities, both linear and nonlinear) admits an epsilon-approximate representation as a typed directed acyclic graph (DAG) whose nodes are drawn from a library of exactly 11 canonical primitives: Propagate, Modulate, Project, Encode, Convolve, Accumulate, Detect, Sample, Disperse, Scatter, and Transform. We call this the Finite Primitive Basis Theorem. The proof is constructive: we provide an algorithm that, given any H in Cimg, produces a DAG G with relative operator error at most epsilon and graph complexity within prescribed bounds. We further prove that the library is minimal: removing any single primitive causes at least one modality to lose its epsilon-approximate representation. A systematic analysis of nonlinearities in imaging physics shows they fall into two structural categories: pointwise scalar functions (handled by Transform) and self-consistent iterations (unrolled into existing linear primitives). Empirical validation on 31 linear modalities confirms eimg below 0.01 with at most 5 nodes and depth 5, and we provide constructive DAG decompositions for 9 additional nonlinear modalities. These results establish mathematical foundations for the Physics World Model (PWM) framework.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Verbal-prompted segmentation is inherently limited by the expressiveness of natural language and struggles with uncommon, instance-specific, or difficult-to-describe objects: scenarios frequently encountered in manufacturing and 3D printing environments. While image exemplars provide an alternative, they primarily encode appearance cues such as color and texture, which are often unrelated to a part's geometric identity. In industrial settings, a single component may be produced in different materials, finishes, or colors, making appearance-based prompting unreliable. In contrast, such objects are typically defined by precise CAD models that capture their canonical geometry. We propose a CAD-prompted segmentation framework built on SAM3 that uses canonical multi-view renderings of a CAD model as prompt input. The rendered views provide geometry-based conditioning independent of surface appearance. The model is trained using synthetic data generated from mesh renderings in simulation under diverse viewpoints and scene contexts. Our approach enables single-stage, CAD-prompted mask prediction, extending promptable segmentation to objects that cannot be robustly described by language or appearance alone.

Abstract: Despite recent progress in 3D hand reconstruction from monocular videos, most existing methods rely on data captured in well-controlled environments and therefore degrade in real-world settings with severe perturbations, such as hand-object interactions, extreme poses, illumination changes, and motion blur. To tackle these issues, we introduce WildGHand, an optimization-based framework that enables self-adaptive 3D Gaussian splatting on in-the-wild videos and produces high-fidelity hand avatars. WildGHand incorporates two key components: (i) a dynamic perturbation disentanglement module that explicitly represents perturbations as time-varying biases on 3D Gaussian attributes during optimization, and (ii) a perturbation-aware optimization strategy that generates per-frame anisotropic weighted masks to guide optimization. Together, these components allow the framework to identify and suppress perturbations across both spatial and temporal dimensions. We further curate a dataset of monocular hand videos captured under diverse perturbations to benchmark in-the-wild hand avatar reconstruction. Extensive experiments on this dataset and two public datasets demonstrate that WildGHand achieves state-of-the-art performance and substantially improves over its base model across multiple metrics (e.g., up to a $15.8\%$ relative gain in PSNR and a $23.1\%$ relative reduction in LPIPS). Our implementation and dataset are available at https://github.com/XuanHuang0/WildGHand.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文档伪造数据集依赖传统数字编辑工具(如Photoshop)，而最先进的检测器对快速增长的AI伪造文档欺诈威胁存在严重盲区，需要专门的基准来评估这一新兴威胁。

Method: 使用Gemini 2.5 Flash Image和Ideogram v2 Edit两个AI修复API，从四个公开文档数据集(CORD, WildReceipt, SROIE, XFUND)的系统性伪造数字字段，生成4,061张伪造图像，以像素级标注篡改区域掩码。

Result: 三个代表性检测器(TruFor, DocTamper, GPT-4o)性能大幅下降：TruFor AUC=0.751(零样本外分布) vs 0.96(NIST16)；DocTamper AUC=0.563 vs 0.98(内分布)，像素级IoU=0.020；GPT-4o仅0.509，接近随机猜测。

Conclusion: AIForge-Doc代表了文档取证领域全新的未解挑战，AI伪造值对自动化检测器和视觉语言模型几乎无法区分，证明现有方法无法有效应对AI生成的文档伪造威胁。

Abstract: We present AIForge-Doc, the first dedicated benchmark targeting exclusively diffusion-model-based inpainting in financial and form documents with pixel-level annotation. Existing document forgery datasets rely on traditional digital editing tools (e.g., Adobe Photoshop, GIMP), creating a critical gap: state-of-the-art detectors are blind to the rapidly growing threat of AI-forged document fraud. AIForge-Doc addresses this gap by systematically forging numeric fields in real-world receipt and form images using two AI inpainting APIs -- Gemini 2.5 Flash Image and Ideogram v2 Edit -- yielding 4,061 forged images from four public document datasets (CORD, WildReceipt, SROIE, XFUND) across nine languages, annotated with pixel-precise tampered-region masks in DocTamper-compatible format. We benchmark three representative detectors -- TruFor, DocTamper, and a zero-shot GPT-4o judge -- and find that all existing methods degrade substantially: TruFor achieves AUC=0.751 (zero-shot, out-of-distribution) vs. AUC=0.96 on NIST16; DocTamper achieves AUC=0.563 vs. AUC=0.98 in-distribution, with pixel-level IoU=0.020; GPT-4o achieves only 0.509 -- essentially at chance -- confirming that AI-forged values are indistinguishable to automated detectors and VLMs. These results demonstrate that AIForge-Doc represents a qualitatively new and unsolved challenge for document forensics.

Abstract: The evolution of autonomous driving towards full automation demands robust interactive capabilities; however, the development of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models is constrained by the sparsity of interactive scenarios and inadequate multimodal alignment in existing data. To this end, this paper proposes the Interactive Enhanced Driving Dataset (IEDD). We develop a scalable pipeline to mine million-level interactive segments from naturalistic driving data based on interactive trajectories, and design metrics to quantify the interaction processes. Furthermore, the IEDD-VQA dataset is constructed by generating synthetic Bird's Eye View (BEV) videos where semantic actions are strictly aligned with structured language. Benchmark results evaluating ten mainstream Vision Language Models (VLMs) are provided to demonstrate the dataset's reuse value in assessing and fine-tuning the reasoning capabilities of autonomous driving models.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as promising candidates for end-to-end autonomous driving. However, these models typically face challenges in inference latency, action precision, and explainability. Existing autoregressive approaches struggle with slow token-by-token generation, while prior diffusion-based planners often rely on verbose, general-purpose language tokens that lack explicit geometric structure. In this work, we propose Masked Vision-Language-Action Diffusion for Autonomous Driving (MVLAD-AD), a novel framework designed to bridge the gap between efficient planning and semantic explainability via a masked vision-language-action diffusion model. Unlike methods that force actions into the language space, we introduce a discrete action tokenization strategy that constructs a compact codebook of kinematically feasible waypoints from real-world driving distributions. Moreover, we propose geometry-aware embedding learning to ensure that embeddings in the latent space approximate physical geometric metrics. Finally, an action-priority decoding strategy is introduced to prioritize trajectory generation. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and derived benchmarks demonstrate that MVLAD-AD achieves superior efficiency and outperforms state-of-the-art autoregressive and diffusion baselines in planning precision, while providing high-fidelity and explainable reasoning.

Abstract: Propagation-based video editing enables precise user control by propagating a single edited frame into following frames while maintaining the original context such as motion and structures. However, training such models requires large-scale, paired (source and edited) video datasets, which are costly and complex to acquire. Hence, we propose the PropFly, a training pipeline for Propagation-based video editing, relying on on-the-Fly supervision from pre-trained video diffusion models (VDMs) instead of requiring off-the-shelf or precomputed paired video editing datasets. Specifically, our PropFly leverages one-step clean latent estimations from intermediate noised latents with varying Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) scales to synthesize diverse pairs of 'source' (low-CFG) and 'edited' (high-CFG) latents on-the-fly. The source latent serves as structural information of the video, while the edited latent provides the target transformation for learning propagation. Our pipeline enables an additional adapter attached to the pre-trained VDM to learn to propagate edits via Guidance-Modulated Flow Matching (GMFM) loss, which guides the model to replicate the target transformation. Our on-the-fly supervision ensures the model to learn temporally consistent and dynamic transformations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our PropFly significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on various video editing tasks, producing high-quality editing results.

Abstract: Long-term environmental monitoring requires the ability to reconstruct and align 3D models across repeated site visits separated by months or years. However, existing Structure-from-Motion (SfM) pipelines implicitly assume near-simultaneous image capture and limited appearance change, and therefore fail when applied to long-term monitoring scenarios such as coral reef surveys, where substantial visual and structural change is common. In this paper, we show that the primary limitation of current approaches lies in their reliance on post-hoc alignment of independently reconstructed sessions, which is insufficient under large temporal appearance change. We address this limitation by enforcing cross-session correspondences directly within a joint SfM reconstruction. Our approach combines complementary handcrafted and learned visual features to robustly establish correspondences across large temporal gaps, enabling the reconstruction of a single coherent 3D model from imagery captured years apart, where standard independent and joint SfM pipelines break down. We evaluate our method on long-term coral reef datasets exhibiting significant real-world change, and demonstrate consistent joint reconstruction across sessions in cases where existing methods fail to produce coherent reconstructions. To ensure scalability to large datasets, we further restrict expensive learned feature matching to a small set of likely cross-session image pairs identified via visual place recognition, which reduces computational cost and improves alignment robustness.

Motivation: 现有手物交互解析方法存在三个关键问题：1）查询初始化依赖语义线索或可学习参数，对变化场景中的活动物体适应性有限；2）使用像素级语义特征迭代优化可能引入非交互相关噪声；3）容易产生物理不一致的预测（交互幻觉）。需要新的架构来提升交互理解能力。

Abstract: A fine-grained understanding of egocentric human-environment interactions is crucial for developing next-generation embodied agents. One fundamental challenge in this area involves accurately parsing hands and active objects. While transformer-based architectures have demonstrated considerable potential for such tasks, several key limitations remain unaddressed: 1) existing query initialization mechanisms rely primarily on semantic cues or learnable parameters, demonstrating limited adaptability to changing active objects across varying input scenes; 2) previous transformer-based methods utilize pixel-level semantic features to iteratively refine queries during mask generation, which may introduce interaction-irrelevant content into the final embeddings; and 3) prevailing models are susceptible to "interaction illusion", producing physically inconsistent predictions. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end Interaction-aware Transformer (InterFormer), which integrates three key components, i.e., a Dynamic Query Generator (DQG), a Dual-context Feature Selector (DFS), and the Conditional Co-occurrence (CoCo) loss. The DQG explicitly grounds query initialization in the spatial dynamics of hand-object contact, enabling targeted generation of interaction-aware queries for hands and various active objects. The DFS fuses coarse interactive cues with semantic features, thereby suppressing interaction-irrelevant noise and emphasizing the learning of interactive relationships. The CoCo loss incorporates hand-object relationship constraints to enhance physical consistency in prediction. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the EgoHOS and the challenging out-of-distribution mini-HOI4D datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization ability. Code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/yuggiehk/InterFormer.

Abstract: 3D object affordance grounding aims to identify regions on 3D objects that support human-object interaction (HOI), a capability essential to embodied visual reasoning. However, most existing approaches rely on static visual or textual cues, neglecting that affordances are inherently defined by dynamic actions. As a result, they often struggle to localize the true contact regions involved in real interactions. We take a different perspective. Humans learn how to use objects by observing and imitating actions, not just by examining shapes. Motivated by this intuition, we introduce video-guided 3D affordance grounding, which leverages dynamic interaction sequences to provide functional supervision. To achieve this, we propose VAGNet, a framework that aligns video-derived interaction cues with 3D structure to resolve ambiguities that static cues cannot address. To support this new setting, we introduce PVAD, the first HOI video-3D pairing affordance dataset, providing functional supervision unavailable in prior works. Extensive experiments on PVAD show that VAGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming static-based baselines. The code and dataset will be open publicly.

Abstract: Open-world object detection (OWOD) requires incrementally detecting known categories while reliably identifying unknown objects. Existing methods primarily focus on improving unknown recall, yet overlook interpretability, often leading to known-unknown confusion and reduced prediction reliability. This paper aims to make the entire OWOD framework interpretable, enabling the detector to truly "knowing the unknown". To this end, we propose a concept-driven InterPretable OWOD framework(IPOW) by introducing a Concept Decomposition Model (CDM) for OWOD, which explicitly decomposes the coupled RoI features in Faster R-CNN into discriminative, shared, and background concepts. Discriminative concepts identify the most discriminative features to enlarge the distances between known categories, while shared and background concepts, due to their strong generalization ability, can be readily transferred to detect unknown categories. Leveraging the interpretable framework, we identify that known-unknown confusion arises when unknown objects fall into the discriminative space of known classes. To address this, we propose Concept-Guided Rectification (CGR) to further resolve such confusion. Extensive experiments show that IPOW significantly improves unknown recall while mitigating confusion, and provides concept-level interpretability for both known and unknown predictions.

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-generated content has facilitated sophisticated face manipulation, severely undermining visual integrity and posing unprecedented challenges to intellectual property. In response, a common proactive defense leverages fragile watermarks to detect, localize, or even recover manipulated regions. However, these methods always assume an adversary unaware of the embedded watermark, overlooking their inherent vulnerability to watermark removal attacks. Furthermore, this fragility is exacerbated in the commonly used dual-watermark strategy that adds a robust watermark for image ownership verification, where mutual interference and limited embedding capacity reduce the fragile watermark's effectiveness. To address the gap, we propose RecoverMark, a watermarking framework that achieves robust manipulation localization, content recovery, and ownership verification simultaneously. Our key insight is twofold. First, we exploit a critical real-world constraint: an adversary must preserve the background's semantic consistency to avoid visual detection, even if they apply global, imperceptible watermark removal attacks. Second, using the image's own content (face, in this paper) as the watermark enhances extraction robustness. Based on these insights, RecoverMark treats the protected face content itself as the watermark and embeds it into the surrounding background. By designing a robust two-stage training paradigm with carefully crafted distortion layers that simulate comprehensive potential attacks and a progressive training strategy, RecoverMark achieves a robust watermark embedding in no fragile manner for image manipulation localization, recovery, and image IP protection simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed RecoverMark's robustness against both seen and unseen attacks and its generalizability to in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is intrinsically ill-posed, hence training a high-performance deep learning based M3OD model requires a humongous amount of labeled data with complicated visual variation from diverse scenes, variety of objects and camera poses.However, we observe that, due to strong human bias, the three independent entities, i.e., object, scene, and camera pose, are always tightly entangled when an image is captured to construct training data. More specifically, specific 3D objects are always captured in particular scenes with fixed camera poses, and hence lacks necessary diversity. Such tight entanglement induces the challenging issues of insufficient utilization and overfitting to uniform training data. To mitigate this, we propose an online object-scene-camera decomposition and recomposition data manipulation scheme to more efficiently exploit the training data. We first fully decompose training images into textured 3D object point models and background scenes in an efficient computation and storage manner. We then continuously recompose new training images in each epoch by inserting the 3D objects into the freespace of the background scenes, and rendering them with perturbed camera poses from textured 3D point representation. In this way, the refreshed training data in all epochs can cover the full spectrum of independent object, scene, and camera pose combinations. This scheme can serve as a plug-and-play component to boost M3OD models, working flexibly with both fully and sparsely supervised settings. In the sparsely-supervised setting, objects closest to the ego-camera for all instances are sparsely annotated. We then can flexibly increase the annotated objects to control annotation cost. For validation, our method is widely applied to five representative M3OD models and evaluated on both the KITTI and the more complicated Waymo datasets.

TL;DR: TraqPoint：一种通过强化学习直接优化关键点跟踪质量的序列决策方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于学习的关键点匹配方法主要在图像对上训练，这未能显式优化关键点在序列中面对视角和光照变化时的长期跟踪能力。本文将关键点检测重新框架为序列决策问题。

Method: 引入了TraqPoint，这是一个新颖的端到端强化学习框架，设计用于直接在图像序列上优化关键点的跟踪质量。核心创新是一个跟踪感知的奖励机制，通过策略梯度方法同时促进多视角中关键点的一致性和独特性。

Result: 在稀疏匹配基准（包括相对位姿估计和3D重建）上的广泛评估表明，TraqPoint显著优于一些最先进的关键点检测和描述方法。

Conclusion: 将关键点检测作为序列决策问题处理，并通过强化学习直接优化跟踪质量，能够显著提升关键点的长期跟踪性能和在3D视觉任务中的表现。

Abstract: Keypoint-based matching is a fundamental component of modern 3D vision systems, such as Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and SLAM. Most existing learning-based methods are trained on image pairs, a paradigm that fails to explicitly optimize for the long-term trackability of keypoints across sequences under challenging viewpoint and illumination changes. In this paper, we reframe keypoint detection as a sequential decision-making problem. We introduce TraqPoint, a novel, end-to-end Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework designed to optimize the \textbf{Tra}ck-\textbf{q}uality (Traq) of keypoints directly on image sequences. Our core innovation is a track-aware reward mechanism that jointly encourages the consistency and distinctiveness of keypoints across multiple views, guided by a policy gradient method. Extensive evaluations on sparse matching benchmarks, including relative pose estimation and 3D reconstruction, demonstrate that TraqPoint significantly outperforms some state-of-the-art (SOTA) keypoint detection and description methods.

TL;DR: SIFormer：针对4D毫米波雷达稀疏特性的场景-实例感知Transformer，通过分割和深度引导的视图变换抑制背景噪声，2D实例提示注入BEV空间增强实例感知，并结合Transformer融合图像语义与雷达几何，实现了雷达-相机融合检测的SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 4D毫米波雷达因其鲁棒性和经济性成为自动驾驶感知的有前景的模态，但其稀疏且弱的几何线索使得可靠的实例激活变得困难，限制了现有雷达-相机融合范式的效果。BEV级融合提供全局场景理解但实例关注弱，视角级融合捕获实例细节但缺乏整体上下文。

Method: 1）通过分割和深度引导的定位在视图变换中抑制背景噪声；2）引入跨视图激活机制，将2D实例提示注入BEV空间，在弱雷达几何下实现可靠的实例感知；3）基于Transformer的融合模块聚合互补的图像语义和雷达几何进行鲁棒感知。

Result: SIFormer在View-of-Delft、TJ4DRadSet和NuScenes数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SIFormer通过增强实例感知，桥接了BEV级融合和视角级融合两种范式的差距，结合它们的互补优势，解决了雷达的固有稀疏性问题，提高了检测精度。

Abstract: 4D millimeter-wave radar has emerged as a promising sensing modality for autonomous driving due to its robustness and affordability. However, its sparse and weak geometric cues make reliable instance activation difficult, limiting the effectiveness of existing radar-camera fusion paradigms. BEV-level fusion offers global scene understanding but suffers from weak instance focus, while perspective-level fusion captures instance details but lacks holistic context. To address these limitations, we propose SIFormer, a scene-instance aware transformer for 3D object detection using 4D radar and camera. SIFormer first suppresses background noise during view transformation through segmentation- and depth-guided localization. It then introduces a cross-view activation mechanism that injects 2D instance cues into BEV space, enabling reliable instance awareness under weak radar geometry. Finally, a transformer-based fusion module aggregates complementary image semantics and radar geometry for robust perception. As a result, with the aim of enhancing instance awareness, SIFormer bridges the gap between the two paradigms, combining their complementary strengths to address inherent sparse nature of radar and improve detection accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that SIFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on View-of-Delft, TJ4DRadSet and NuScenes datasets. Source code is available at github.com/shawnnnkb/SIFormer.

Abstract: Accurate and stable field-of-view (FoV) guidance is critical for safe and efficient minimally invasive surgery, yet existing approaches often conflate visual attention estimation with downstream camera control or rely on direct object-centric assumptions. In this work, we formulate surgical attention tracking as a spatio-temporal learning problem and model surgeon focus as a dense attention heatmap, enabling continuous and interpretable frame-wise FoV guidance. We propose SurgAtt-Tracker, a holistic framework that robustly tracks surgical attention by exploiting temporal coherence through proposal-level reranking and motion-aware refinement, rather than direct regression. To support systematic training and evaluation, we introduce SurgAtt-1.16M, a large-scale benchmark with a clinically grounded annotation protocol that enables comprehensive heatmap-based attention analysis across procedures and institutions. Extensive experiments on multiple surgical datasets demonstrate that SurgAtt-Tracker consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance and strong robustness under occlusion, multi-instrument interference, and cross-domain settings. Beyond attention tracking, our approach provides a frame-wise FoV guidance signal that can directly support downstream robotic FoV planning and automatic camera control.

TL;DR: DCQ 通过减少色彩空间冗余来压缩视觉数据集，同时保留模型训练所需的关键信息，在保持高效训练的前提下显著减少了数据存储需求。

Motivation: 大规模图像数据集对于深度学习至关重要，但其高存储需求在资源受限环境中部署面临挑战。现有方法主要通过丢弃样本来减少数据集大小，但忽视了每张图像内部的显著冗余，特别是在色彩空间方面。

Method: 提出了数据集颜色量化（DCQ）框架，通过以下方式压缩视觉数据集：1）在相似图像间强制执行一致的调色板表示；2）根据模型感知选择性保留语义重要的颜色；3）保持结构细节以支持有效的特征学习。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、Tiny-ImageNet和ImageNet-1K上的广泛实验表明，DCQ在激进压缩条件下显著提高了训练性能，为数据集级存储减少提供了可扩展且鲁棒的解决方案。

Conclusion: DCQ通过专注于减少色彩空间冗余而非丢弃数据样本，提供了一种有效的大规模视觉数据集压缩方法，在保持模型性能的同时显著降低了存储需求。

Abstract: Large-scale image datasets are fundamental to deep learning, but their high storage demands pose challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. While existing approaches reduce dataset size by discarding samples, they often ignore the significant redundancy within each image -- particularly in the color space. To address this, we propose Dataset Color Quantization (DCQ), a unified framework that compresses visual datasets by reducing color-space redundancy while preserving information crucial for model training. DCQ achieves this by enforcing consistent palette representations across similar images, selectively retaining semantically important colors guided by model perception, and maintaining structural details necessary for effective feature learning. Extensive experiments across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K show that DCQ significantly improves training performance under aggressive compression, offering a scalable and robust solution for dataset-level storage reduction.

Abstract: Interpretability is often an essential requirement in medical imaging. Advanced deep learning methods are required to address this need for explainability and high performance. In this work, we investigate whether additional information available during the training process can be used to create an understandable and powerful model. We propose an innovative solution called Proto-Caps that leverages the benefits of capsule networks, prototype learning and the use of privileged information. Evaluating the proposed solution on the LIDC-IDRI dataset shows that it combines increased interpretability with above state-of-the-art prediction performance. Compared to the explainable baseline model, our method achieves more than 6 % higher accuracy in predicting both malignancy (93.0 %) and mean characteristic features of lung nodules. Simultaneously, the model provides case-based reasoning with prototype representations that allow visual validation of radiologist-defined attributes.

Abstract: 4D radar measurements offer an affordable and weather-robust solution for 3D perception. However, the inherent sparsity and noise of radar point clouds present significant challenges for accurate 3D object detection, underscoring the need for effective and robust point clouds densification. Despite recent progress, existing densification methods often fail to address the extreme sparsity of 4D radar point clouds and exhibit limited robustness when processing scenes with a small number of points. In this paper, we propose SD4R, a novel framework that transforms sparse radar point clouds into dense representations. SD4R begins by utilizing a foreground point generator (FPG) to mitigate noise propagation and produce densified point clouds. Subsequently, a logit-query encoder (LQE) enhances conventional pillarization, resulting in robust feature representations. Through these innovations, our SD4R demonstrates strong capability in both noise reduction and foreground point densification. Extensive experiments conducted on the publicly available View-of-Delft dataset demonstrate that SD4R achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Manual lifting tasks are a major contributor to work-related musculoskeletal disorders, and effective ergonomic risk assessment is essential for quantifying physical exposure and informing ergonomic interventions. The Revised NIOSH Lifting Equation (RNLE) is a widely used ergonomic risk assessment tool for lifting tasks that relies on six task variables, including horizontal (H) and vertical (V) hand distances; such distances are typically obtained through manual measurement or specialized sensing systems and are difficult to use in real-world environments. We evaluated the feasibility of using innovative vision-language models (VLMs) to non-invasively estimate H and V from RGB video streams. Two multi-stage VLM-based pipelines were developed: a text-guided detection-only pipeline and a detection-plus-segmentation pipeline. Both pipelines used text-guided localization of task-relevant regions of interest, visual feature extraction from those regions, and transformer-based temporal regression to estimate H and V at the start and end of a lift. For a range of lifting tasks, estimation performance was evaluated using leave-one-subject-out validation across the two pipelines and seven camera view conditions. Results varied significantly across pipelines and camera view conditions, with the segmentation-based, multi-view pipeline consistently yielding the smallest errors, achieving mean absolute errors of approximately 6-8 cm when estimating H and 5-8 cm when estimating V. Across pipelines and camera view configurations, pixel-level segmentation reduced estimation error by approximately 20-30% for H and 35-40% for V relative to the detection-only pipeline. These findings support the feasibility of VLM-based pipelines for video-based estimation of RNLE distance parameters.

TL;DR: 论文提出了AnimeAgent，首个基于图像到视频(I2V)的多智能体框架，用于解决传统静态扩散模型在自定义故事板生成(CSG)中的局限性，提升了角色一致性和表达力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于静态扩散模型的CSG方法存在三大局限：1）静态模型缺乏动态表达力，常采用“复制粘贴”模式；2）单次推理无法迭代修正缺失属性或提示词遵循问题；3）多智能体方法依赖不鲁棒的评估器，不适合评估风格化非写实动画。为突破这些限制，研究团队提出了新的解决方案。

Method: 受迪士尼“直进与姿态结合”工作流启发，AnimeAgent采用基于I2V的多智能体框架，利用I2V的隐式运动先验提升一致性和表达力，并通过混合主观-客观评审器实现可靠的迭代优化。

Result: 实验表明，AnimeAgent在一致性、提示词忠实度和风格化方面取得了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: AnimeAgent通过创新的I2V基多智能体框架有效解决了现有CSG方法的局限性，在自定义故事板生成任务中实现了显著提升，并为该领域提供了带有人工标注真实值的新基准数据集。

Abstract: Custom Storyboard Generation (CSG) aims to produce high-quality, multi-character consistent storytelling. Current approaches based on static diffusion models, whether used in a one-shot manner or within multi-agent frameworks, face three key limitations: (1) Static models lack dynamic expressiveness and often resort to "copy-paste" pattern. (2) One-shot inference cannot iteratively correct missing attributes or poor prompt adherence. (3) Multi-agents rely on non-robust evaluators, ill-suited for assessing stylized, non-realistic animation. To address these, we propose AnimeAgent, the first Image-to-Video (I2V)-based multi-agent framework for CSG. Inspired by Disney's "Combination of Straight Ahead and Pose to Pose" workflow, AnimeAgent leverages I2V's implicit motion prior to enhance consistency and expressiveness, while a mixed subjective-objective reviewer enables reliable iterative refinement. We also collect a human-annotated CSG benchmark with ground-truth. Experiments show AnimeAgent achieves SOTA performance in consistency, prompt fidelity, and stylization.

Conclusion: 该框架成功实现了迭代式边界框分割与形状生成的协同工作，为交互式3D创作提供了从粗到细的生成能力，填补了辅助人类想象力在3D创作中的研究空白。

Abstract: Human creativity follows a perceptual process, moving from abstract ideas to finer details during creation. While 3D generative models have advanced dramatically, models specifically designed to assist human imagination in 3D creation -- particularly for detailing abstractions from coarse to fine -- have not been explored. We propose a framework that enables intuitive and interactive 3D shape generation by iteratively splitting bounding boxes to refine the set of bounding boxes. The main technical components of our framework are two generative models: the box-splitting generative model and the box-to-shape generative model. The first model, named BoxSplitGen, generates a collection of 3D part bounding boxes with varying granularity by iteratively splitting coarse bounding boxes. It utilizes part bounding boxes created through agglomerative merging and learns the reverse of the merging process -- the splitting sequences. The model consists of two main components: the first learns the categorical distribution of the box to be split, and the second learns the distribution of the two new boxes, given the set of boxes and the indication of which box to split. The second model, the box-to-shape generative model, is trained by leveraging the 3D shape priors learned by an existing 3D diffusion model while adapting the model to incorporate bounding box conditioning. In our experiments, we demonstrate that the box-splitting generative model outperforms token prediction models and the inpainting approach with an unconditional diffusion model. Also, we show that our box-to-shape model, based on a state-of-the-art 3D diffusion model, provides superior results compared to a previous model.

Abstract: A free-viewpoint, editable, and high-fidelity driving simulator is crucial for training and evaluating end-to-end autonomous driving systems. In this paper, we present GA-Drive, a novel simulation framework capable of generating camera views along user-specified novel trajectories through Geometry-Appearance Decoupling and Diffusion-Based Generation. Given a set of images captured along a recorded trajectory and the corresponding scene geometry, GA-Drive synthesizes novel pseudo-views using geometry information. These pseudo-views are then transformed into photorealistic views using a trained video diffusion model. In this way, we decouple the geometry and appearance of scenes. An advantage of such decoupling is its support for appearance editing via state-of-the-art video-to-video editing techniques, while preserving the underlying geometry, enabling consistent edits across both original and novel trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GA-Drive substantially outperforms existing methods in terms of NTA-IoU, NTL-IoU, and FID scores.

Abstract: World foundation models aim to simulate the evolution of the real world with physically plausible behavior. Unlike prior methods that handle spatial and temporal correlations separately, we propose RAYNOVA, a geometry-free world model that employs a dual-causal autoregressive framework. It follows both scale-wise and temporal topological orders in the autoregressive process, and leverages global attention for unified 4D spatio-temporal reasoning. Different from existing works that impose strong 3D geometric priors, RAYNOVA constructs an isotropic spatio-temporal representation across views, frames, and scales based on relative Plücker-ray positional encoding, enabling robust generalization to diverse camera setups and ego motions. We further introduce a recurrent training paradigm to alleviate distribution drift in long-horizon video generation. RAYNOVA achieves state-of-the-art multi-view video generation results on nuScenes, while offering higher throughput and strong controllability under diverse input conditions, generalizing to novel views and camera configurations without explicit 3D scene representation. Our code will be released at http://yichen928.github.io/raynova.

Conclusion: LPP模块能有效解决边缘检测中清晰度不足的问题，实现端到端的清晰边缘学习，为相关领域提供了新的解决方案。代码已开源。

Abstract: Generating crisp, i.e., one-pixel-wide, edge maps remains one of the fundamental challenges in edge detection, affecting both traditional and learning-based methods. To obtain crisp edges, most existing approaches rely on two hand-crafted post-processing algorithms, Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and skeleton-based thinning, which are non-differentiable and hinder end-to-end optimization. Moreover, all existing crisp edge detection methods still depend on such post-processing to achieve satisfactory results. To address this limitation, we propose \MethodLPP, a lightweight, only $\sim$21K additional parameters, and plug-and-play matching-based supervision module that can be appended to any edge detection model for joint end-to-end learning of crisp edges. At each training iteration, \MethodLPP performs one-to-one matching between predicted and ground-truth edges based on spatial distance and confidence, ensuring consistency between training and testing protocols. Extensive experiments on four popular datasets demonstrate that integrating \MethodLPP substantially improves the performance of existing edge detection models. In particular, \MethodLPP increases the Average Crispness (AC) metric by up to 2--4$\times$ compared to baseline models. Under the crispness-emphasized evaluation (CEval), \MethodLPP further boosts baseline performance by up to 20--35\% in ODS and achieves similar gains in OIS and AP, achieving SOTA performance that matches or surpasses standard post-processing for the first time.

Abstract: Estimating sewing patterns from images is a practical approach for creating high-quality 3D garments. Due to the lack of real-world pattern-image paired data, prior approaches fine-tune large vision language models (VLMs) on synthetic garment datasets generated by randomly sampling from a parametric garment model GarmentCode. However, these methods often struggle to generalize to in-the-wild images, fail to capture real-world correlations between garment parts, and are typically restricted to single-layer outfits. In contrast, we observe that VLMs are effective at describing garments in natural language, yet perform poorly when asked to directly regress GarmentCode parameters from images. To bridge this gap, we propose NGL (Natural Garment Language), a novel intermediate language that restructures GarmentCode into a representation more understandable to language models. Leveraging this language, we introduce NGL-Prompter, a training-free pipeline that queries large VLMs to extract structured garment parameters, which are then deterministically mapped to valid GarmentCode. We evaluate our method on the Dress4D, CloSe and a newly collected dataset of approximately 5,000 in-the-wild fashion images. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard geometry metrics and is strongly preferred in both human and GPT-based perceptual evaluations compared to existing baselines. Furthermore, NGL-prompter can recover multi-layer outfits whereas competing methods focus mostly on single-layer garments, highlighting its strong generalization to real-world images even with occluded parts. These results demonstrate that accurate sewing pattern reconstruction is possible without costly model training. Our code and data will be released for research use.

Abstract: Reconstructing deformable endoscopic tissues is crucial for achieving robot-assisted surgery. However, 3D Gaussian Splatting-based approaches encounter challenges in achieving consistent tissue surface reconstruction, while existing NeRF-based methods lack real-time rendering capabilities. In pursuit of both smooth deformable surfaces and real-time rendering, we introduce a novel approach based on 3D Gaussian Splatting. Specifically, we introduce surface-aware reconstruction, initially employing a Sign Distance Field-based method to construct a mesh, subsequently utilizing this mesh to constrain the Gaussian Splatting reconstruction process. Furthermore, to ensure the generation of physically plausible deformations, we incorporate local rigidity and global non-rigidity restrictions to guide Gaussian deformation, tailored for the highly deformable nature of soft endoscopic tissue. Based on 3D Gaussian Splatting, our proposed method delivers a fast rendering process and smooth surface appearances. Quantitative and qualitative analysis against alternative methodologies shows that our approach achieves solid reconstruction quality in both textures and geometries.

TL;DR: 本文提出CleanStyle框架解决扩散模型风格迁移中的内容泄漏问题，通过SVD分解和时变指数调度抑制尾部组件，并提出风格特定CFG提升生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于编码器的风格迁移方法虽然高效且免调优，但常出现内容泄漏问题——风格图像的语义元素会不理想地出现在输出中，损害提示保真度和风格一致性。

Method: 提出了CleanStyleSVD（CS-SVD）方法：通过SVD分解将泄露内容隔离到尾部分量，并用时变指数调度动态抑制这些组件；同时提出风格特定类别自由引导（SS-CFG），利用被抑制的尾部组件构建风格感知的无条件输入。

Result: 实验表明CleanStyle显著减少了内容泄漏，提升了多种风格参考和提示下的风格化质量和提示对齐度。

Conclusion: CleanStyle是轻量级、可解释的即插即用框架，无需重新训练即可嵌入现有编码器扩散模型，能有效解决内容泄漏问题并提升风格化生成质量。

Abstract: Style transfer in diffusion models enables controllable visual generation by injecting the style of a reference image. However, recent encoder-based methods, while efficient and tuning-free, often suffer from content leakage, where semantic elements from the style image undesirably appear in the output, impairing prompt fidelity and stylistic consistency. In this work, we introduce CleanStyle, a plug-and-play framework that filters out content-related noise from the style embedding without retraining. Motivated by empirical analysis, we observe that such leakage predominantly stems from the tail components of the style embedding, which are isolated via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). To address this, we propose CleanStyleSVD (CS-SVD), which dynamically suppresses tail components using a time-aware exponential schedule, providing clean, style-preserving conditional embeddings throughout the denoising process. Furthermore, we present Style-Specific Classifier-Free Guidance (SS-CFG), which reuses the suppressed tail components to construct style-aware unconditional inputs. Unlike conventional methods that use generic negative embeddings (e.g., zero vectors), SS-CFG introduces targeted negative signals that reflect style-specific but prompt-irrelevant visual elements. This enables the model to effectively suppress these distracting patterns during generation, thereby improving prompt fidelity and enhancing the overall visual quality of stylized outputs. Our approach is lightweight, interpretable, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing encoder-based diffusion models without retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CleanStyle substantially reduces content leakage, improves stylization quality and improves prompt alignment across a wide range of style references and prompts.

Abstract: Diffusion-based image generators excel at producing realistic content from text or image conditions, but they offer only limited explicit control over low-level, physically grounded shading and material properties. In contrast, physically based rendering (PBR) offers fine-grained physical control but lacks prompt-driven flexibility. Although these two paradigms originate from distinct communities, both share a common evolution -- from noisy observations to clean images. In this paper, we propose a unified stochastic formulation that bridges Monte Carlo rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling. First, a general stochastic differential equation (SDE) formulation for Monte Carlo integration under the Central Limit Theorem is modeled. Through instantiation via physically based path tracing, we convert it into a physically grounded SDE representation. Moreover, we provide a systematic analysis of how the physical characteristics of path tracing can be extended to existing diffusion models from the perspective of noise variance. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks show that our method can exert physically grounded control over diffusion-generated results, covering tasks such as rendering and material editing.

TL;DR: COMiT是一种受人类交流启发的离散视觉token序列学习框架，通过迭代观察图像局部块并循环更新离散表示来构建结构化token序列。


<details>

Motivation: 现有离散图像tokenizer主要针对重建和压缩优化，其生成的token往往捕获局部纹理而非对象级语义结构。受人类交流的渐进性和组合性启发，研究者希望开发能产生结构化token序列的tokenization方法。

Method: COMiT在固定token预算内，通过迭代观察局部图像裁剪并循环更新其离散表示来构建潜在消息。模型在每一步集成新的视觉信息并精化现有token序列。最终消息用于调节流匹配解码器重建完整图像。编码和解码在单个Transformer模型中实现，使用流匹配重建和语义表示对齐损失的组合进行端到端训练。

Result: 实验表明，语义对齐提供了基础，而注意力顺序tokenization对于产生可解释的、以对象为中心的token结构至关重要，相较于先前方法显著提高了组合泛化和关系推理能力。

Conclusion: COMiT框架通过受人类交流启发的迭代tokenization方法，成功生成了结构化、语义化的视觉token序列，在保持重建效果的同时显著提升了模型的组合泛化和关系推理能力。

Abstract: Discrete image tokenizers have emerged as a key component of modern vision and multimodal systems, providing a sequential interface for transformer-based architectures. However, most existing approaches remain primarily optimized for reconstruction and compression, often yielding tokens that capture local texture rather than object-level semantic structure. Inspired by the incremental and compositional nature of human communication, we introduce COMmunication inspired Tokenization (COMiT), a framework for learning structured discrete visual token sequences. COMiT constructs a latent message within a fixed token budget by iteratively observing localized image crops and recurrently updating its discrete representation. At each step, the model integrates new visual information while refining and reorganizing the existing token sequence. After several encoding iterations, the final message conditions a flow-matching decoder that reconstructs the full image. Both encoding and decoding are implemented within a single transformer model and trained end-to-end using a combination of flow-matching reconstruction and semantic representation alignment losses. Our experiments demonstrate that while semantic alignment provides grounding, attentive sequential tokenization is critical for inducing interpretable, object-centric token structure and substantially improving compositional generalization and relational reasoning over prior methods.

TL;DR: OrthoDiffusion是一个基于扩散模型的统一基础模型，用于多任务肌肉骨骼MRI解读，在膝关节解剖分割和异常检测方面表现优异，具有较强的泛化能力和数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肌肉骨骼疾病是全球致残的主要原因，MRI诊断复杂且依赖专家经验。现有方法需要大量标注数据，且对不同的解剖平面和临床中心缺乏鲁棒性。

Method: 开发OrthoDiffusion统一扩散基础模型，使用三个方向特定的3D扩散模型在15,948个未标注膝关节MRI扫描上进行自监督预训练，学习矢状位、冠状位和轴向位的稳健解剖特征表示。这些视图特定表示被集成以支持解剖分割和多标签诊断等临床任务。

Result: OrthoDiffusion能够分割11个膝关节结构并检测8种膝关节异常，在不同临床中心和MRI场强下表现鲁棒，且仅需10%训练标签即可保持高精度。此外，该模型学到的表示可迁移到其他关节（如踝关节和肩关节）的11种疾病诊断。

Conclusion: 扩散模型基础模型可作为肌肉骨骼MRI多疾病诊断和解剖分割的统一平台，有望提高真实临床工作流程中MRI解读的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders represent a significant global health burden and are a leading cause of disability worldwide. While MRI is essential for accurate diagnosis, its interpretation remains exceptionally challenging. Radiologists must identify multiple potential abnormalities within complex anatomical structures across different imaging planes, a process that requires significant expertise and is prone to variability. We developed OrthoDiffusion, a unified diffusion-based foundation model designed for multi-task musculoskeletal MRI interpretation. The framework utilizes three orientation-specific 3D diffusion models, pre-trained in a self-supervised manner on 15,948 unlabeled knee MRI scans, to learn robust anatomical features from sagittal, coronal, and axial views. These view-specific representations are integrated to support diverse clinical tasks, including anatomical segmentation and multi-label diagnosis. Our evaluation demonstrates that OrthoDiffusion achieves excellent performance in the segmentation of 11 knee structures and the detection of 8 knee abnormalities. The model exhibited remarkable robustness across different clinical centers and MRI field strengths, consistently outperforming traditional supervised models. Notably, in settings where labeled data was scarce, OrthoDiffusion maintained high diagnostic precision using only 10\% of training labels. Furthermore, the anatomical representations learned from knee imaging proved highly transferable to other joints, achieving strong diagnostic performance across 11 diseases of the ankle and shoulder. These findings suggest that diffusion-based foundation models can serve as a unified platform for multi-disease diagnosis and anatomical segmentation, potentially improving the efficiency and accuracy of musculoskeletal MRI interpretation in real-world clinical workflows.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has emerged as a transformative tool in medical image analysis, yet developing robust and generalizable segmentation models remains difficult due to fragmented, privacy-constrained imaging data siloed across institutions. While federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without centralizing data, cross-modality domain shifts pose a critical challenge, particularly when models trained on one modality fail to generalize to another. Many existing solutions require paired multimodal data per patient or rely on complex architectures, both of which are impractical in real clinical settings. In this work, we consider a realistic FL scenario where each client holds single-modality data (CT or MRI), and systematically investigate augmentation strategies for cross-modality generalization. Using abdominal organ segmentation and whole-heart segmentation as representative multi-class and binary segmentation benchmarks, we evaluate convolution-based spatial augmentation, frequency-domain manipulation, domain-specific normalization, and global intensity nonlinear (GIN) augmentation. Our results show that GIN consistently outperforms alternatives in both centralized and federated settings by simulating cross-modality appearance variations while preserving anatomical structure. For the pancreas, Dice score improved from 0.073 to 0.437, a 498% gain. Our federated approach achieves 93-98% of centralized training accuracy, demonstrating strong cross-modality generalization without compromising data privacy, pointing toward feasible federated AI deployment across diverse healthcare systems.

Abstract: Event-based cameras are bio-inspired sensors with pixels that independently and asynchronously respond to brightness changes at microsecond resolution, offering the potential to handle visual tasks in challenging scenarios. However, due to the sparse information content in individual events, directly processing the raw event data to solve vision tasks is highly inefficient, which severely limits the applicability of state-of-the-art methods in real-time tasks, such as motion segmentation, a fundamental task for dynamic scene understanding. Incorporating normal flow as an intermediate representation to compress motion information from event clusters within a localized region provides a more effective solution. In this work, we propose a normal flow-based motion segmentation framework for event-based vision. Leveraging the dense normal flow directly learned from event neighborhoods as input, we formulate the motion segmentation task as an energy minimization problem solved via graph cuts, and optimize it iteratively with normal flow clustering and motion model fitting. By using a normal flow-based motion model initialization and fitting method, the proposed system is able to efficiently estimate the motion models of independently moving objects with only a limited number of candidate models, which significantly reduces the computational complexity and ensures real-time performance, achieving nearly a 800x speedup in comparison to the open-source state-of-the-art method. Extensive evaluations on multiple public datasets fully demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our framework.

Abstract: Modeling spinal motion is fundamental to understanding human biomechanics, yet remains underexplored in computer vision due to the spine's complex multi-joint kinematics and the lack of large-scale 3D annotations. We present a biomechanics-aware keypoint simulation framework that augments existing human pose datasets with anatomically consistent 3D spinal keypoints derived from musculoskeletal modeling. Using this framework, we create the first open dataset, named SIMSPINE, which provides sparse vertebra-level 3D spinal annotations for natural full-body motions in indoor multi-camera capture without external restraints. With 2.14 million frames, this enables data-driven learning of vertebral kinematics from subtle posture variations and bridges the gap between musculoskeletal simulation and computer vision. In addition, we release pretrained baselines covering fine-tuned 2D detectors, monocular 3D pose lifting models, and multi-view reconstruction pipelines, establishing a unified benchmark for biomechanically valid spine motion estimation. Specifically, our 2D spine baselines improve the state-of-the-art from 0.63 to 0.80 AUC in controlled environments, and from 0.91 to 0.93 AP for in-the-wild spine tracking. Together, the simulation framework and SIMSPINE dataset advance research in vision-based biomechanics, motion analysis, and digital human modeling by enabling reproducible, anatomically grounded 3D spine estimation under natural conditions.

TL;DR: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for Autonomous Driving lack cross-view geometric modeling capabilities. VGGDrive addresses this by integrating pre-trained 3D foundation models to empower VLMs.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Existing VLMs lack cross-view 3D geometric modeling, which is crucial for autonomous driving tasks. This deficiency leads to mediocre performance in diverse evaluation scenarios, even when auxiliary training data is employed.

Method: Proposed VGGDrive architecture: a plug-and-play Cross-View 3D Geometric Enabler (CVGE) bridges frozen 3D visual model features with VLM's 2D features. Uses hierarchical adaptive injection mechanism to decouple VLM base architecture and inject 3D features effectively.

Result: Extensive experiments across five autonomous driving benchmarks show VGGDrive enhances base VLM performance. Tasks include cross-view risk perception, motion prediction, and trajectory planning. The integration demonstrates the potential of leveraging mature 3D foundation models.

Conclusion: Mature 3D foundation models can be effectively integrated into autonomous driving systems to address critical geometric modeling gaps. VGGDrive serves as an initial exploration, showcasing a promising paradigm for advancing VLMs in driving tasks.

Abstract: The significance of cross-view 3D geometric modeling capabilities for autonomous driving is self-evident, yet existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) inherently lack this capability, resulting in their mediocre performance. While some promising approaches attempt to mitigate this by constructing Q&A data for auxiliary training, they still fail to fundamentally equip VLMs with the ability to comprehensively handle diverse evaluation protocols. We thus chart a new course, advocating for the infusion of VLMs with the cross-view geometric grounding of mature 3D foundation models, closing this critical capability gap in autonomous driving. In this spirit, we propose a novel architecture, VGGDrive, which empowers Vision-language models with cross-view Geometric Grounding for autonomous Driving. Concretely, to bridge the cross-view 3D geometric features from the frozen visual 3D model with the VLM's 2D visual features, we introduce a plug-and-play Cross-View 3D Geometric Enabler (CVGE). The CVGE decouples the base VLM architecture and effectively empowers the VLM with 3D features through a hierarchical adaptive injection mechanism. Extensive experiments show that VGGDrive enhances base VLM performance across five autonomous driving benchmarks, including tasks like cross-view risk perception, motion prediction, and trajectory planning. It's our belief that mature 3D foundation models can empower autonomous driving tasks through effective integration, and we hope our initial exploration demonstrates the potential of this paradigm to the autonomous driving community.

Conclusion: 提出的RU4D-SLAM框架有效地解决了动态环境中的SLAM挑战，通过不确定性感知和4D表示大幅提升了系统的鲁棒性和重建质量。

Abstract: Combining 3D Gaussian splatting with Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has gained popularity as it enables continuous 3D environment reconstruction during motion. However, existing methods struggle in dynamic environments, particularly moving objects complicate 3D reconstruction and, in turn, hinder reliable tracking. The emergence of 4D reconstruction, especially 4D Gaussian splatting, offers a promising direction for addressing these challenges, yet its potential for 4D-aware SLAM remains largely underexplored. Along this direction, we propose a robust and efficient framework, namely Reweighting Uncertainty in Gaussian Splatting SLAM (RU4D-SLAM) for 4D scene reconstruction, that introduces temporal factors into spatial 3D representation while incorporating uncertainty-aware perception of scene changes, blurred image synthesis, and dynamic scene reconstruction. We enhance dynamic scene representation by integrating motion blur rendering, and improve uncertainty-aware tracking by extending per-pixel uncertainty modeling, which is originally designed for static scenarios, to handle blurred images. Furthermore, we propose a semantic-guided reweighting mechanism for per-pixel uncertainty estimation in dynamic scenes, and introduce a learnable opacity weight to support adaptive 4D mapping. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both trajectory accuracy and 4D scene reconstruction, particularly in dynamic environments with moving objects and low-quality inputs.

Abstract: Detecting hateful content in multimodal memes presents unique challenges, as harmful messages often emerge from the complex interplay between benign images and text.

Conclusion: 该研究证明通过结合优化的DDS技术和基于LoRA的预训练概念适配器，能够在不训练模型的情况下实现高质量的多概念图像编辑，有效弥补了单纯文本提示在表达复杂视觉概念方面的局限性。

Abstract: Editing images with diffusion models without training remains challenging. While recent optimisation-based methods achieve strong zero-shot edits from text, they struggle to preserve identity or capture details that language alone cannot express. Many visual concepts such as facial structure, material texture, or object geometry are impossible to express purely through text prompts alone. To address this gap, we introduce a training-free framework for concept-based image editing, which unifies Optimised DDS with LoRA-driven concept composition, where the training data of the LoRA represent the concept. Our approach enables combining and controlling multiple visual concepts directly within the diffusion process, integrating semantic guidance from text with low-level cues from pretrained concept adapters. We further refine DDS for stability and controllability through ordered timesteps, regularisation, and negative-prompt guidance. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate consistent improvements over existing training-free diffusion editing methods on InstructPix2Pix and ComposLoRA benchmarks. Code will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: 提出的混合框架解决了图像融合领域效率与性能的权衡问题，通过线性构建融合输出确保关键应用中的高保真度，代码已开源。

Abstract: Image fusion seeks to integrate complementary information from multiple sources into a single, superior image. While traditional methods are fast, they lack adaptability and performance. Conversely, deep learning approaches achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results but suffer from critical inefficiencies: their reliance on slow, resource-intensive, patch-based training introduces a significant gap with full-resolution inference. We propose a novel hybrid framework that resolves this trade-off. Our method utilizes a learnable U-Net to generate a dynamic guidance map that directs a classic, fixed Laplacian pyramid fusion kernel. This decoupling of policy learning from pixel synthesis enables remarkably efficient full-resolution training, eliminating the train-inference gap. Consequently, our model achieves SOTA-comparable performance in about one minute on a RTX 4090 or two minutes on a consumer laptop GPU from scratch without any external model and demonstrates powerful zero-shot generalization across diverse tasks, from infrared-visible to medical imaging. By design, the fused output is linearly constructed solely from source information, ensuring high faithfulness for critical applications.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) transfer visual and textual data into a shared embedding space. In so doing, they enable a wide range of multimodal tasks, while also raising critical questions about the nature of machine 'understanding.'

To this end, we evaluate seven methods, combining zero-shot localization experiments with human interpretability studies.

Abstract: While existing unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods greatly enhance target domain performance in semantic segmentation, they often neglect network calibration quality, resulting in misalignment between prediction confidence and actual accuracy -- a significant risk in safety-critical applications. Our key insight emerges from observing that performance degrades substantially when soft pseudo-labels replace hard pseudo-labels in cross-domain scenarios due to poor calibration, despite the theoretical equivalence of perfectly calibrated soft pseudo-labels to hard pseudo-labels. Based on this finding, we propose DA-Cal, a dedicated cross-domain calibration framework that transforms target domain calibration into soft pseudo-label optimization. DA-Cal introduces a Meta Temperature Network to generate pixel-level calibration parameters and employs bi-level optimization to establish the relationship between soft pseudo-labels and UDA supervision, while utilizing complementary domain-mixing strategies to prevent overfitting and reduce domain discrepancies. Experiments demonstrate that DA-Cal seamlessly integrates with existing self-training frameworks across multiple UDA segmentation benchmarks, significantly improving target domain calibration while delivering performance gains without inference overhead. The code will be released.

Conclusion: CASG通过冲突感知的自适应安全引导，能够在避免多类别干扰的同时，大幅降低文本到图像生成中的有害内容产生率。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated significant advancements in generating high-quality images, while raising potential safety concerns regarding harmful content generation. Safety-guidance-based methods have been proposed to mitigate harmful outputs by steering generation away from harmful zones, where the zones are averaged across multiple harmful categories based on predefined keywords. However, these approaches fail to capture the complex interplay among different harm categories, leading to "harmful conflicts" where mitigating one type of harm may inadvertently amplify another, thus increasing overall harmful rate. To address this issue, we propose Conflict-aware Adaptive Safety Guidance (CASG), a training-free framework that dynamically identifies and applies the category-aligned safety direction during generation. CASG is composed of two components: (i) Conflict-aware Category Identification (CaCI), which identifies the harmful category most aligned with the model's evolving generative state, and (ii) Conflict-resolving Guidance Application (CrGA), which applies safety steering solely along the identified category to avoid multi-category interference. CASG can be applied to both latent-space and text-space safeguards. Experiments on T2I safety benchmarks demonstrate CASG's state-of-the-art performance, reducing the harmful rate by up to 15.4% compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been increasingly applied in real-world scenarios due to their outstanding understanding and reasoning capabilities. Although VLMs have already demonstrated impressive capabilities in common visual question answering and logical reasoning, they still lack the ability to make reasonable decisions in complex real-world environments. We define this ability as spatial logical reasoning, which not only requires understanding the spatial relationships among objects in complex scenes, but also the logical dependencies between steps in multi-step tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce Spatial Logical Question Answering (SpatiaLQA), a benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial logical reasoning capabilities of VLMs. SpatiaLQA consists of 9,605 question answer pairs derived from 241 real-world indoor scenes. We conduct extensive experiments on 41 mainstream VLMs, and the results show that even the most advanced models still struggle with spatial logical reasoning. To address this issue, we propose a method called recursive scene graph assisted reasoning, which leverages visual foundation models to progressively decompose complex scenes into task-relevant scene graphs, thereby enhancing the spatial logical reasoning ability of VLMs, outperforming all previous methods.

TL;DR: 提出了TextPecker——一种即插即用的感知结构异常的强化学习策略，用于改善文本到图像生成中的视觉文本渲染质量，通过构建字符级结构异常标注数据集和笔画编辑合成引擎来提升模型对文本结构错误的感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前先进的文本到图像生成模型在视觉文本渲染(VTR)方面仍存在结构异常问题（如扭曲、模糊、错位），而主流的多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)和专业OCR模型往往无法有效感知这些结构异常，这限制了VTR的评估和基于强化学习的优化效果。

Method: 1. 构建包含字符级结构异常标注的识别数据集；2. 开发笔画编辑合成引擎以扩大结构错误覆盖范围；3. 提出TextPecker——一种即插即用的感知结构异常的强化学习策略，可与任何文本到图像生成器配合使用，减轻噪声奖励信号的影响。

Result: TextPecker显著提升了多种文本到图像模型的性能：在优化良好的Qwen-Image模型上，中文文本渲染的结构保真度平均提升4%，语义对齐度提升8.7%，在高质量视觉文本渲染方面达到新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: 本研究填补了视觉文本渲染优化领域的空白，为实现可靠且结构忠实的视觉文本生成提供了基础性步骤，提出的TextPecker方法能有效解决现有模型在文本结构异常感知方面的瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Visual Text Rendering (VTR) remains a critical challenge in text-to-image generation, where even advanced models frequently produce text with structural anomalies such as distortion, blurriness, and misalignment. However, we find that leading MLLMs and specialist OCR models largely fail to perceive these structural anomalies, creating a critical bottleneck for both VTR evaluation and RL-based optimization. As a result, even state-of-the-art generators (e.g., SeedDream4.0, Qwen-Image) still struggle to render structurally faithful text. To address this, we propose TextPecker, a plug-and-play structural anomaly perceptive RL strategy that mitigates noisy reward signals and works with any textto-image generator. To enable this capability, we construct a recognition dataset with character-level structural-anomaly annotations and develop a stroke-editing synthesis engine to expand structural-error coverage. Experiments show that TextPecker consistently improves diverse text-to-image models; even on the well-optimized Qwen-Image, it significantly yields average gains of 4% in structural fidelity and 8.7% in semantic alignment for Chinese text rendering, establishing a new state-of-the-art in high-fidelity VTR. Our work fills a gap in VTR optimization, providing a foundational step towards reliable and structural faithful visual text generation.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical and underexplored challenge of long video understanding with low computational budgets. We propose LongVideo-R1, an active, reasoning-equipped multimodal large language model (MLLM) agent designed for efficient video context navigation, avoiding the redundancy of exhaustive search. At the core of LongVideo-R1 lies a reasoning module that leverages high-level visual cues to infer the most informative video clip for subsequent processing. During inference, the agent initiates traversal from top-level visual summaries and iteratively refines its focus, immediately halting the exploration process upon acquiring sufficient knowledge to answer the query. To facilitate training, we first extract hierarchical video captions from CGBench, a video corpus with grounding annotations, and guide GPT-5 to generate 33K high-quality chain-of-thought-with-tool trajectories. The LongVideo-R1 agent is fine-tuned upon the Qwen-3-8B model through a two-stage paradigm: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by reinforcement learning (RL), where RL employs a specifically designed reward function to maximize selective and efficient clip navigation. Experiments on multiple long video benchmarks validate the effectiveness of name, which enjoys superior tradeoff between QA accuracy and efficiency. All curated data and source code are provided in the supplementary material and will be made publicly available. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/qiujihao19/LongVideo-R1

Abstract: Recent 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) Dropout methods address overfitting under sparse-view conditions by randomly nullifying Gaussian opacities. However, we identify a neighbor compensation effect in these approaches: dropped Gaussians are often compensated by their neighbors, weakening the intended regularization. Moreover, these methods overlook the contribution of high-degree spherical harmonic coefficients (SH) to overfitting. To address these issues, we propose DropAnSH-GS, a novel anchor-based Dropout strategy. Rather than dropping Gaussians independently, our method randomly selects certain Gaussians as anchors and simultaneously removes their spatial neighbors. This effectively disrupts local redundancies near anchors and encourages the model to learn more robust, globally informed representations. Furthermore, we extend the Dropout to color attributes by randomly dropping higher-degree SH to concentrate appearance information in lower-degree SH. This strategy further mitigates overfitting and enables flexible post-training model compression via SH truncation. Experimental results demonstrate that DropAnSH-GS substantially outperforms existing Dropout methods with negligible computational overhead, and can be readily integrated into various 3DGS variants to enhance their performances.

Abstract: Dynamic driving scene reconstruction is critical for autonomous driving simulation and closed-loop learning. While recent feed-forward methods have shown promise for 3D reconstruction, they struggle with long-range driving sequences due to quadratic complexity in sequence length and challenges in modeling dynamic objects over extended durations. We propose UFO, a novel recurrent paradigm that combines the benefits of optimization-based and feed-forward methods for efficient long-range 4D reconstruction. Our approach maintains a 4D scene representation that is iteratively refined as new observations arrive, using a visibility-based filtering mechanism to select informative scene tokens and enable efficient processing of long sequences. For dynamic objects, we introduce an object pose-guided modeling approach that supports accurate long-range motion capture. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms both per-scene optimization and existing feed-forward methods across various sequence lengths. Notably, our approach can reconstruct 16-second driving logs within 0.5 second while maintaining superior visual quality and geometric accuracy.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in diffusion models, AI generated images still often contain visual artifacts that compromise realism. Although more thorough pre-training and bigger models might reduce artifacts, there is no assurance that they can be completely eliminated, which makes artifact mitigation a highly crucial area of study. Previous artifact-aware methodologies depend on human-labeled artifact datasets, which are costly and difficult to scale, underscoring the need for an automated approach to reliably acquire artifact-annotated datasets. In this paper, we propose ArtiAgent, which efficiently creates pairs of real and artifact-injected images. It comprises three agents: a perception agent that recognizes and grounds entities and subentities from real images, a synthesis agent that introduces artifacts via artifact injection tools through novel patch-wise embedding manipulation within a diffusion transformer, and a curation agent that filters the synthesized artifacts and generates both local and global explanations for each instance. Using ArtiAgent, we synthesize 100K images with rich artifact annotations and demonstrate both efficacy and versatility across diverse applications. Code is available at link.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像标注依赖人工标注数据集成本高昂，虽然多模态大语言模型有自动化标注潜力，但尚未充分探索其替代人工标注的能力，需要分析两者差距并提出解决方案。

Method: 提出TagLLM框架，包含两个组件：候选标签生成（使用结构化分组提示高效生成覆盖尽可能多真实标签的紧凑候选集），以及标签消歧（交互式校准提示中的类别语义概念并有效细化候选标签）。

Result: 实验表明TagLLM显著缩小了MLLM生成标注与人工标注的差距，在下游训练性能上缩小了约60-80%的差异，标注质量达到人工的50-80%，成本仅为人工的千分之一。

Conclusion: TagLLM通过结构化提示和交互式消歧有效缩小了MLLM标注与人工标注的差距，证明了MLLM在自动化图像标注中的可行性和巨大潜力，能大幅降低成本同时保持较高的标注质量。

Abstract: Image tagging, a fundamental vision task, traditionally relies on human-annotated datasets to train multi-label classifiers, which incurs significant labor and costs. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer promising potential to automate annotation, their capability to replace human annotators remains underexplored. This paper aims to analyze the gap between MLLM-generated and human annotations and to propose an effective solution that enables MLLM-based annotation to replace manual labeling. Our analysis of MLLM annotations reveals that, under a conservative estimate, MLLMs can reduce annotation cost to as low as one-thousandth of the human cost, mainly accounting for GPU usage, which is nearly negligible compared to manual efforts. Their annotation quality reaches about 50\% to 80\% of human performance, while achieving over 90\% performance on downstream training tasks.Motivated by these findings, we propose TagLLM, a novel framework for image tagging, which aims to narrow the gap between MLLM-generated and human annotations. TagLLM comprises two components: Candidates generation, which employs structured group-wise prompting to efficiently produce a compact candidate set that covers as many true labels as possible while reducing subsequent annotation workload; and label disambiguation, which interactively calibrates the semantic concept of categories in the prompts and effectively refines the candidate labels. Extensive experiments show that TagLLM substantially narrows the gap between MLLM-generated and human annotations, especially in downstream training performance, where it closes about 60\% to 80\% of the difference.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance by integrating powerful language backbones with large-scale visual encoders. Among these, latent Chain-of-Thought (CoT) methods enable implicit reasoning in continuous hidden states, facilitating seamless vision-language integration and faster inference. However, existing heuristically predefined supervision signals in latent CoT provide limited guidance for preserving critical visual information in intermediate latent states. To address this limitation, we propose CrystaL (Crystallized Latent Reasoning), a single-stage framework with two paths to process intact and corrupted images, respectively. By explicitly aligning the attention patterns and prediction distributions across the two paths, CrystaL crystallizes latent representations into task-relevant visual semantics, without relying on auxiliary annotations or external modules. Extensive experiments on perception-intensive benchmarks demonstrate that CrystaL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving substantial gains in fine-grained visual understanding while maintaining robust reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了视频到音频生成中的长时生成挑战，无需在长时数据上训练即可实现超过5分钟的高质量音频生成

Abstract: Scaling multimodal alignment between video and audio is challenging, particularly due to limited data and the mismatch between text descriptions and frame-level video information. In this work, we tackle the scaling challenge in multimodal-to-audio generation, examining whether models trained on short instances can generalize to longer ones during testing. To tackle this challenge, we present multimodal hierarchical networks so-called MMHNet, an enhanced extension of state-of-the-art video-to-audio models. Our approach integrates a hierarchical method and non-causal Mamba to support long-form audio generation. Our proposed method significantly improves long audio generation up to more than 5 minutes. We also prove that training short and testing long is possible in the video-to-audio generation tasks without training on the longer durations. We show in our experiments that our proposed method could achieve remarkable results on long-video to audio benchmarks, beating prior works in video-to-audio tasks. Moreover, we showcase our model capability in generating more than 5 minutes, while prior video-to-audio methods fall short in generating with long durations.

Conclusion: EW-DETR框架能有效解决演化世界物体检测的多重挑战，提升开放世界检测的鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Real-world object detection must operate in evolving environments where new classes emerge, domains shift, and unseen objects must be identified as "unknown": all without accessing prior data. We introduce Evolving World Object Detection (EWOD), a paradigm coupling incremental learning, domain adaptation, and unknown detection under exemplar-free constraints. To tackle EWOD, we propose EW-DETR framework that augments DETR-based detectors with three synergistic modules: Incremental LoRA Adapters for exemplar-free incremental learning under evolving domains; a Query-Norm Objectness Adapter that decouples objectness-aware features from DETR decoder queries; and Entropy-Aware Unknown Mixing for calibrated unknown detection. This framework generalises across DETR-based detectors, enabling state-of-the-art RF-DETR to operate effectively in evolving-world settings. We also introduce FOGS (Forgetting, Openness, Generalisation Score) to holistically evaluate performance across these dimensions. Extensive experiments on Pascal Series and Diverse Weather benchmarks show EW-DETR outperforms other methods, improving FOGS by 57.24%.

Abstract: Disentangling visual layers in real-world images is a persistent challenge in vision and graphics, as such layers often involve non-linear and globally coupled interactions, including shading, reflection, and perspective distortion. In this work, we present an in-context image decomposition framework that leverages large diffusion foundation models for layered separation. We focus on the challenging case of logo-object decomposition, where the goal is to disentangle a logo from the surface on which it appears while faithfully preserving both layers. Our method fine-tunes a pretrained diffusion model via lightweight LoRA adaptation and introduces a cycle-consistent tuning strategy that jointly trains decomposition and composition models, enforcing reconstruction consistency between decomposed and recomposed images. This bidirectional supervision substantially enhances robustness in cases where the layers exhibit complex interactions. Furthermore, we introduce a progressive self-improving process, which iteratively augments the training set with high-quality model-generated examples to refine performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves accurate and coherent decompositions and also generalizes effectively across other decomposition types, suggesting its potential as a unified framework for layered image decomposition.

Abstract: Image-to-Video (I2V) generation models, which condition video generation on reference images, have shown emerging visual instruction-following capability, allowing certain visual cues in reference images to act as implicit control signals for video generation. However, this capability also introduces a previously overlooked risk: adversaries may exploit visual instructions to inject malicious intent through the image modality. In this work, we uncover this risk by proposing Visual Instruction Injection (VII), a training-free and transferable jailbreaking framework that intentionally disguises the malicious intent of unsafe text prompts as benign visual instructions in the safe reference image. Specifically, VII coordinates a Malicious Intent Reprogramming module to distill malicious intent from unsafe text prompts while minimizing their static harmfulness, and a Visual Instruction Grounding module to ground the distilled intent onto a safe input image by rendering visual instructions that preserve semantic consistency with the original unsafe text prompt, thereby inducing harmful content during I2V generation. Empirically, our extensive experiments on four state-of-the-art commercial I2V models (Kling-v2.5-turbo, Gemini Veo-3.1, Seedance-1.5-pro, and PixVerse-V5) demonstrate that VII achieves Attack Success Rates of up to 83.5% while reducing Refusal Rates to near zero, significantly outperforming existing baselines.

Abstract: Medical image processing demands specialized software that handles high-dimensional volumetric data, heterogeneous file formats, and domain-specific training procedures. Existing frameworks either provide low-level components that require substantial integration effort or impose rigid, monolithic pipelines that resist modification. We present MIP Candy (MIPCandy), a freely available, PyTorch-based framework designed specifically for medical image processing. MIPCandy provides a complete, modular pipeline spanning data loading, training, inference, and evaluation, allowing researchers to obtain a fully functional process workflow by implementing a single method, $\texttt{build_network}$, while retaining fine-grained control over every component. Central to the design is $\texttt{LayerT}$, a deferred configuration mechanism that enables runtime substitution of convolution, normalization, and activation modules without subclassing. The framework further offers built-in $k$-fold cross-validation, dataset inspection with automatic region-of-interest detection, deep supervision, exponential moving average, multi-frontend experiment tracking (Weights & Biases, Notion, MLflow), training state recovery, and validation score prediction via quotient regression. An extensible bundle ecosystem provides pre-built model implementations that follow a consistent trainer--predictor pattern and integrate with the core framework without modification.

Abstract: Real-time object detection is crucial for real-world applications as it requires high accuracy with low latency. While Detection Transformers (DETR) have demonstrated significant performance improvements, current real-time DETR models are challenging to reproduce from scratch due to excessive pre-training overheads on the backbone, constraining research advancements by hindering the exploration of novel backbone architectures. In this paper, we want to show that by using general good design, it is possible to have \textbf{high performance} with \textbf{low pre-training cost}. After a thorough study of the backbone architecture, we propose EfficientNAT at various scales, which incorporates modern efficient convolution and local attention mechanisms. Moreover, we re-design the hybrid encoder with local attention, significantly enhancing both performance and inference speed. Based on these advancements, we present Le-DETR (\textbf{L}ow-cost and \textbf{E}fficient \textbf{DE}tection \textbf{TR}ansformer), which achieves a new \textbf{SOTA} in real-time detection using only ImageNet1K and COCO2017 training datasets, saving about 80\% images in pre-training stage compared with previous methods. We demonstrate that with well-designed, real-time DETR models can achieve strong performance without the need for complex and computationally expensive pretraining. Extensive experiments show that Le-DETR-M/L/X achieves \textbf{52.9/54.3/55.1 mAP} on COCO Val2017 with \textbf{4.45/5.01/6.68 ms} on an RTX4090. It surpasses YOLOv12-L/X by \textbf{+0.6/-0.1 mAP} while achieving similar speed and \textbf{+20\%} speedup. Compared with DEIM-D-FINE, Le-DETR-M achieves \textbf{+0.2 mAP} with slightly faster inference, and surpasses DEIM-D-FINE-L by \textbf{+0.4 mAP} with only \textbf{0.4 ms} additional latency.

Method: 提出VAUQ框架，引入图像信息分数(IS)来量化视觉输入对预测不确定度的减少程度，并结合无监督核心区域掩码策略增强显著区域的影响。将预测熵与核心掩码IS相结合，得到无需训练的评分函数。

Result: 在多个数据集上的综合实验表明，VAUQ在自评估任务中持续优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VAUQ通过显式测量模型输出对视觉证据的依赖程度，为大视觉语言模型提供了有效的自我评估框架，能更可靠地反映答案正确性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) frequently hallucinate, limiting their safe deployment in real-world applications. Existing LLM self-evaluation methods rely on a model's ability to estimate the correctness of its own outputs, which can improve deployment reliability; however, they depend heavily on language priors and are therefore ill-suited for evaluating vision-conditioned predictions. We propose VAUQ, a vision-aware uncertainty quantification framework for LVLM self-evaluation that explicitly measures how strongly a model's output depends on visual evidence. VAUQ introduces the Image-Information Score (IS), which captures the reduction in predictive uncertainty attributable to visual input, and an unsupervised core-region masking strategy that amplifies the influence of salient regions. Combining predictive entropy with this core-masked IS yields a training-free scoring function that reliably reflects answer correctness. Comprehensive experiments show that VAUQ consistently outperforms existing self-evaluation methods across multiple datasets.

Conclusion: CHAIN基准的引入填补了评估物理结构理解能力的空白，研究表明现有模型在该领域存在显著不足，为未来的模型开发提供了重要的评估工具和方向指引。

Abstract: Understanding the physical structure is essential for real-world applications such as embodied agents, interactive design, and long-horizon manipulation. Yet, prevailing Vision-Language Model (VLM) evaluations still center on structure-agnostic, single-turn setups (e.g., VQA), which fail to assess agents' ability to reason about how geometry, contact, and support relations jointly constrain what actions are possible in a dynamic environment. To address this gap, we introduce the Causal Hierarchy of Actions and Interactions (CHAIN) benchmark, an interactive 3D, physics-driven testbed designed to evaluate whether models can understand, plan, and execute structured action sequences grounded in physical constraints. CHAIN shifts evaluation from passive perception to active problem solving, spanning tasks such as interlocking mechanical puzzles and 3D stacking and packing. We conduct a comprehensive study of state-of-the-art VLMs and diffusion-based models under unified interactive settings. Our results show that top-performing models still struggle to internalize physical structure and causal constraints, often failing to produce reliable long-horizon plans and cannot robustly translate perceived structure into effective actions.

Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言模型（如CLIP）在理解否定概念方面存在困难，通常将肯定和否定表述嵌入到相似的表示中（如把“没有狗”与狗的图片匹配）。现有方法通过微调CLIP的文本编码器来改进否定理解，但存在过拟合风险。

Method: CLIPGlasses采用即插即用框架设计，包含两个模块：Lens模块从文本嵌入中解耦否定语义，Frame模块预测上下文感知的排斥强度。该框架通过修改相似度计算来惩罚与否定语义的对齐，从而减少误匹配。

Result: 实验表明，配备了CLIPGlasses的CLIP在域内性能具有竞争力，在跨域泛化方面优于最先进方法。其优势在低资源条件下尤为明显，显示出更强的跨域鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CLIPGlasses框架成功解决了CLIP在理解否定语义方面的不足，通过创新的双阶段设计实现了更好的跨域泛化性能，特别是在资源有限的情况下表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP struggle to understand negation, often embedding affirmatives and negatives similarly (e.g., matching "no dog" with dog images). Existing methods refine negation understanding via fine-tuning CLIP's text encoder, risking overfitting. In this work, we propose CLIPGlasses, a plug-and-play framework that enhances CLIP's ability to comprehend negated visual descriptions. CLIPGlasses adopts a dual-stage design: a Lens module disentangles negated semantics from text embeddings, and a Frame module predicts context-aware repulsion strength, which is integrated into a modified similarity computation to penalize alignment with negated semantics, thereby reducing false positive matches. Experiments show that CLIP equipped with CLIPGlasses achieves competitive in-domain performance and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-domain generalization. Its superiority is especially evident under low-resource conditions, indicating stronger robustness across domains.

Abstract: Deep learning has significantly advanced automated brain tumor diagnosis, yet clinical adoption remains limited by interpretability and computational constraints. Conventional models often act as opaque ''black boxes'' and fail to quantify the complex, irregular tumor boundaries that characterize malignant growth. To address these challenges, we present XMorph, an explainable and computationally efficient framework for fine-grained classification of three prominent brain tumor types: glioma, meningioma, and pituitary tumors. We propose an Information-Weighted Boundary Normalization (IWBN) mechanism that emphasizes diagnostically relevant boundary regions alongside nonlinear chaotic and clinically validated features, enabling a richer morphological representation of tumor growth. A dual-channel explainable AI module combines GradCAM++ visual cues with LLM-generated textual rationales, translating model reasoning into clinically interpretable insights. The proposed framework achieves a classification accuracy of 96.0%, demonstrating that explainability and high performance can co-exist in AI-based medical imaging systems. The source code and materials for XMorph are all publicly available at: https://github.com/ALSER-Lab/XMorph.

Result: 在TibetanMNIST、Shui、古彝文和东巴文等数据集上评估，OmniOCR超越零样本基础模型和标准后训练方法，达到最先进的准确率，参数量高效；相比现有最优基线模型，在这四个数据集上准确率提升39%-66%。

Conclusion: OmniOCR为解决少数民族文字OCR问题提供了一个参数高效且性能卓越的解决方案，通过动态适配机制有效应对低资源和多文字场景的挑战。

Abstract: Optical character recognition (OCR) has advanced rapidly with deep learning and multimodal models, yet most methods focus on well-resourced scripts such as Latin and Chinese. Ethnic minority languages remain underexplored due to complex writing systems, scarce annotations, and diverse historical and modern forms, making generalization in low-resource or zero-shot settings challenging. To address these challenges, we present OmniOCR, a universal framework for ethnic minority scripts. OmniOCR introduces Dynamic Low-Rank Adaptation (Dynamic LoRA) to allocate model capacity across layers and scripts, enabling effective adaptation while preserving knowledge.A sparsity regularization prunes redundant updates, ensuring compact and efficient adaptation without extra inference cost. Evaluations on TibetanMNIST, Shui, ancient Yi, and Dongba show that OmniOCR outperforms zero-shot foundation models and standard post training, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy with superior parameter efficiency, and compared with the state-of-the-art baseline models, it improves accuracy by 39%-66% on these four datasets.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential on complex visual understanding tasks through iterative optimization methods.However, these models generally lack effective self-correction mechanisms, making it difficult for them to independently rectify cognitive biases. Consequently, during multi-turn revisions, they often fall into repetitive and ineffective attempts, failing to achieve stable improvements in answer quality.To address this issue, we propose a novel iterative self-correction framework that endows models with two key capabilities: Capability Reflection and Memory Reflection. This framework guides the model to first diagnose errors and generate a correction plan via Capability Reflection, then leverage Memory Reflection to review past attempts to avoid repetition and explore new solutions, and finally, optimize the answer through rigorous re-reasoning. Experiments on the challenging OCRBench v2 benchmark show that OCR-Agent outperforms the current open-source SOTA model InternVL3-8B by +2.0 on English and +1.2 on Chinese subsets, while achieving state-of-the-art results in Visual Understanding (79.9) and Reasoning (66.5) - surpassing even larger fine-tuned models. Our method demonstrates that structured, self-aware reflection can significantly enhance VLMs' reasoning robustness without additional training. Code: https://github.com/AIGeeksGroup/OCR-Agent.

Abstract: Understanding the locations of occupants in a commercial built environment is critical for realizing energy savings by delivering lighting, heating, and cooling only where it is needed. The key to achieving this goal is being able to recognize zone occupancy in real time, without impeding occupants' activities or compromising privacy. While low-resolution, privacy-preserving time-of-flight (ToF) sensor networks have demonstrated good performance in zone counting, the performance depends on careful sensor placement. To address this issue, we propose an automatic sensor placement method that determines optimal sensor layouts for a given number of sensors, and can predict the counting accuracy of such a layout. In particular, given the geometric constraints of an office environment, we simulate a large number of occupant trajectories. We then formulate the sensor placement problem as an integer linear programming (ILP) problem and solve it with the branch and bound method. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method based on simulations of several different office environments.

Abstract: Reconstructing high-fidelity 3D head geometry from images is critical for a wide range of applications, yet existing methods face fundamental limitations. Traditional photogrammetry achieves exceptional detail but requires extensive camera arrays (25-200+ views), substantial computation, and manual cleanup in challenging areas like facial hair. Recent alternatives present a fundamental trade-off: foundation models enable efficient single-image reconstruction but lack fine geometric detail, while optimization-based methods achieve higher fidelity but require dense views and expensive computation. We bridge this gap with a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of both paradigms. Our method introduces a multi-view surface normal prediction model that extends monocular foundation models with cross-view attention to produce geometrically consistent normals in a feed-forward pass. We then leverage these predictions as strong geometric priors within an inverse rendering optimization framework to recover high-frequency surface details. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art single-image and multi-view methods, achieving high-fidelity reconstruction on par with dense-view photogrammetry while reducing camera requirements and computational cost. The code and model will be released.

Abstract: Fast-flying aerial robots promise rapid inspection under limited battery constraints, with direct applications in infrastructure inspection, terrain exploration, and search and rescue. However, high speeds lead to severe motion blur in images and induce significant drift and noise in pose estimates, making dense 3D reconstruction with Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) particularly challenging due to their high sensitivity to such degradations. In this work, we present a unified framework that leverages asynchronous event streams alongside motion-blurred frames to reconstruct high-fidelity radiance fields from agile drone flights. By embedding event-image fusion into NeRF optimization and jointly refining event-based visual-inertial odometry priors using both event and frame modalities, our method recovers sharp radiance fields and accurate camera trajectories without ground-truth supervision. We validate our approach on both synthetic data and real-world sequences captured by a fast-flying drone. Despite highly dynamic drone flights, where RGB frames are severely degraded by motion blur and pose priors become unreliable, our method reconstructs high-fidelity radiance fields and preserves fine scene details, delivering a performance gain of over 50% on real-world data compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: 该框架能够从2D图像有效学习3D参数化B-rep表示，在几何重建和特征学习方面表现出色。

Abstract: The boundary representation (B-rep) models a 3D solid as its explicit boundaries: trimmed corners, edges, and faces. Recovering B-rep representation from unstructured data is a challenging and valuable task of computer vision and graphics. Recent advances in deep learning have greatly improved the recovery of 3D shape geometry, but still depend on dense and clean point clouds and struggle to generalize to novel shapes. We propose B-rep Gaussian Splatting (BrepGaussian), a novel framework that learns 3D parametric representations from 2D images. We employ a Gaussian Splatting renderer with learnable features, followed by a specific fitting strategy. To disentangle geometry reconstruction and feature learning, we introduce a two-stage learning framework that first captures geometry and edges and then refines patch features to achieve clean geometry and coherent instance representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our approach to state-of-the-art methods. We will release our code and datasets upon acceptance.

Abstract: Object perception is fundamental for tasks such as robotic material handling and quality inspection. However, modern supervised deep-learning perception models require large datasets for robust automation under semi-uncontrolled conditions. The cost of acquiring and annotating such data for proprietary parts is a major barrier for widespread deployment. In this context, we release SynthRender, an open source framework for synthetic image generation with Guided Domain Randomization capabilities. Furthermore, we benchmark recent Reality-to-Simulation techniques for 3D asset creation from 2D images of real parts. Combined with Domain Randomization, these synthetic assets provide low-overhead, transferable data even for parts lacking 3D files. We also introduce IRIS, the Industrial Real-Sim Imagery Set, containing 32 categories with diverse textures, intra-class variation, strong inter-class similarities and about 20,000 labels. Ablations on multiple benchmarks outline guidelines for efficient data generation with SynthRender. Our method surpasses existing approaches, achieving 99.1% mAP@50 on a public robotics dataset, 98.3% mAP@50 on an automotive benchmark, and 95.3% mAP@50 on IRIS.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) have evolved from general-purpose applications to specialized use cases such as in the clinical domain, demonstrating potential for decision support in radiology. One promising application is assisting radiologists in decision-making by the analysis of radiology imaging data such as chest X-rays (CXR) via a visual and natural language question-answering (VQA) interface. When longitudinal imaging is available, radiologists analyze temporal changes, which are essential for accurate diagnosis and prognosis. The manual longitudinal analysis is a time-consuming process, motivating the development of a training framework that can provide prognostic capabilities. We introduce a novel training framework LUMEN, that is optimized for longitudinal CXR interpretation, leveraging multi-image and multi-task instruction fine-tuning to enhance prognostic and diagnostic performance. We conduct experiments on the publicly available MIMIC-CXR and its associated Medical-Diff-VQA datasets. We further formulate and construct a novel instruction-following dataset incorporating longitudinal studies, enabling the development of a prognostic VQA task. Our method demonstrates significant improvements over baseline models in diagnostic VQA tasks, and more importantly, shows promising potential for prognostic capabilities. These results underscore the value of well-designed, instruction-tuned VLMs in enabling more accurate and clinically meaningful radiological interpretation of longitudinal radiological imaging data.

Abstract: We present SPRITETOMESH, a fully automatic pipeline for converting 2D game sprite images into triangle meshes compatible with skeletal animation frameworks such as Spine2D. Creating animation-ready meshes is traditionally a tedious manual process requiring artists to carefully place vertices along visual boundaries, a task that typically takes 15-60 minutes per sprite. Our method addresses this through a hybrid learned-algorithmic approach. A segmentation network (EfficientNet-B0 encoder with U-Net decoder) trained on over 100,000 sprite-mask pairs from 172 games achieves an IoU of 0.87, providing accurate binary masks from arbitrary input images. From these masks, we extract exterior contour vertices using Douglas-Peucker simplification with adaptive arc subdivision, and interior vertices along visual boundaries detected via bilateral-filtered multi-channel Canny edge detection with contour-following placement. Delaunay triangulation with mask-based centroid filtering produces the final mesh. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that direct vertex position prediction via neural network heatmap regression is fundamentally not viable for this task: the heatmap decoder consistently fails to converge (loss plateau at 0.061) while the segmentation decoder trains normally under identical conditions. We attribute this to the inherently artistic nature of vertex placement - the same sprite can be meshed validly in many different ways. This negative result validates our hybrid design: learned segmentation where ground truth is unambiguous, algorithmic placement where domain heuristics are appropriate. The complete pipeline processes a sprite in under 3 seconds, representing a speedup of 300x-1200x over manual creation. We release our trained model to the game development community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的文本到图像检索经常面临查询简短且语义模糊的问题：短查询通常只有一两个词，导致语义歧义、缺乏视觉细节描述，且无法控制检索图像的质量。需要一种既能丰富查询语义又能融入质量控制的解决方案。

Method: 1. 使用生成式语言模型作为查询补全函数，将简短查询扩展为包含姿势、场景、美学等细粒度视觉属性的描述性形式。2. 基于相关性和美学评分模型推导离散质量级别，使查询扩展既语义丰富又质量感知。3. 提出与预训练视觉语言模型兼容的通用框架，无需修改现有模型即可工作。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著改善了检索效果，有效实现了质量控制，弥合了现代视觉语言模型表达能力与用户查询简短性之间的差距。系统具有灵活性（兼容任何预训练VLM）、透明性（扩展查询可解释）和可控性（可按偏好质量级别引导结果）。

Conclusion: 通过将简短查询扩展为质量感知的描述性形式，该方法成功提升了文本到图像检索的准确性和可控性，为处理现实世界中短而模糊的用户查询提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image retrieval is a fundamental task in vision-language learning, yet in real-world scenarios it is often challenged by short and underspecified user queries. Such queries are typically only one or two words long, rendering them semantically ambiguous, prone to collisions across diverse visual interpretations, and lacking explicit control over the quality of retrieved images. To address these issues, we propose a new paradigm of quality-controllable retrieval, which enriches short queries with contextual details while incorporating explicit notions of image quality. Our key idea is to leverage a generative language model as a query completion function, extending underspecified queries into descriptive forms that capture fine-grained visual attributes such as pose, scene, and aesthetics. We introduce a general framework that conditions query completion on discretized quality levels, derived from relevance and aesthetic scoring models, so that query enrichment is not only semantically meaningful but also quality-aware. The resulting system provides three key advantages: 1) flexibility, it is compatible with any pretrained vision-language model (VLMs) without modification; 2) transparency, enriched queries are explicitly interpretable by users; and 3) controllability, enabling retrieval results to be steered toward user-preferred quality levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach significantly improves retrieval results and provides effective quality control, bridging the gap between the expressive capacity of modern VLMs and the underspecified nature of short user queries.

Conclusion: 该框架利用大量标准分割掩码构建结构化模型，保持拓扑完整性并提供隐含的解剖对应关系，支持时序跟踪、跨切片重建和形态学群体分析等应用。

Abstract: Graph-based medical image segmentation represents anatomical structures using boundary graphs, providing fixed-topology landmarks and inherent population-level correspondences. However, their clinical adoption has been hindered by a major requirement: training datasets with manually annotated landmarks that maintain point-to-point correspondences across patients rarely exist in practice. We introduce Mask-HybridGNet, a framework that trains graph-based models directly using standard pixel-wise masks, eliminating the need for manual landmark annotations. Our approach aligns variable-length ground truth boundaries with fixed-length landmark predictions by combining Chamfer distance supervision and edge-based regularization to ensure local smoothness and regular landmark distribution, further refined via differentiable rasterization. A significant emergent property of this framework is that predicted landmark positions become consistently associated with specific anatomical locations across patients without explicit correspondence supervision. This implicit atlas learning enables temporal tracking, cross-slice reconstruction, and morphological population analyses. Beyond direct segmentation, Mask-HybridGNet can extract correspondences from existing segmentation masks, allowing it to generate stable anatomical atlases from any high-quality pixel-based model. Experiments across chest radiography, cardiac ultrasound, cardiac MRI, and fetal imaging demonstrate that our model achieves competitive results against state-of-the-art pixel-based methods, while ensuring anatomical plausibility by enforcing boundary connectivity through a fixed graph adjacency matrix. This framework leverages the vast availability of standard segmentation masks to build structured models that maintain topological integrity and provide implicit correspondences.

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit exceptional 2D visual understanding, their ability to comprehend and reason about 3D space--a cornerstone of spatial intelligence--remains superficial. Current methodologies attempt to bridge this domain gap either by relying on explicit 3D modalities or by augmenting VLMs with partial, view-conditioned geometric priors. However, such approaches hinder scalability and ultimately burden the language model with the ill-posed task of implicitly reconstructing holistic 3D geometry from sparse cues. In this paper, we argue that spatial intelligence can emerge inherently from 2D vision alone, rather than being imposed via explicit spatial instruction tuning. To this end, we introduce Spa3R, a self-supervised framework that learns a unified, view-invariant spatial representation directly from unposed multi-view images. Spa3R is built upon the proposed Predictive Spatial Field Modeling (PSFM) paradigm, where Spa3R learns to synthesize feature fields for arbitrary unseen views conditioned on a compact latent representation, thereby internalizing a holistic and coherent understanding of the underlying 3D scene. We further integrate the pre-trained Spa3R Encoder into existing VLMs via a lightweight adapter to form Spa3-VLM, effectively grounding language reasoning in a global spatial context. Experiments on the challenging VSI-Bench demonstrate that Spa3-VLM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 58.6% on 3D VQA, significantly outperforming prior methods. These results highlight PSFM as a scalable path toward advancing spatial intelligence. Code is available at https://github.com/hustvl/Spa3R.

Abstract: Recent diffusion methods have made significant progress in generating videos from single images due to their powerful visual generation capabilities. However, challenges persist in image-to-video synthesis, particularly in human video generation, where inferring view-consistent, motion-dependent clothing wrinkles from a single image remains a formidable problem. In this paper, we present Human Video Generation in 4D (HVG), a latent video diffusion model capable of generating high-quality, multi-view, spatiotemporally coherent human videos from a single image with 3D pose and view control. HVG achieves this through three key designs: (i) Articulated Pose Modulation, which captures the anatomical relationships of 3D joints via a novel dual-dimensional bone map and resolves self-occlusions across views by introducing 3D information; (ii) View and Temporal Alignment, which ensures multi-view consistency and alignment between a reference image and pose sequences for frame-to-frame stability; and (iii) Progressive Spatio-Temporal Sampling with temporal alignment to maintain smooth transitions in long multi-view animations. Extensive experiments on image-to-video tasks demonstrate that HVG outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality 4D human videos from diverse human images and pose inputs.

Abstract: Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) enables high resolution, three-dimensional reconstruction of biological structures, including membranes and membrane proteins. Identification of regions of interest (ROIs) is central to scientific imaging, as it enables isolation and quantitative analysis of specific structural features within complex datasets. In practice, however, ROIs are typically derived indirectly through full structure segmentation followed by post hoc analysis. This limitation is especially apparent for continuous and geometrically complex structures such as membranes, which are segmented as single entities. Here, we developed TomoROIS-SurfORA, a two step framework for direct, shape-agnostic ROI segmentation and morphological surface analysis. TomoROIS performs deep learning-based ROI segmentation and can be trained from scratch using small annotated datasets, enabling practical application across diverse imaging data. SurfORA processes segmented structures as point clouds and surface meshes to extract quantitative morphological features, including inter-membrane distances, curvature, and surface roughness. It supports both closed and open surfaces, with specific considerations for open surfaces, which are common in cryo-ET due to the missing wedge effect. We demonstrate both tools using in vitro reconstituted membrane systems containing deformable vesicles with complex geometries, enabling automatic quantitative analysis of membrane contact sites and remodeling events such as invagination. While demonstrated here on cryo-ET membrane data, the combined approach is applicable to ROI detection and surface analysis in broader scientific imaging contexts.

Abstract: Locally Decodable Codes (LDCs) are error-correcting codes $C\colonΣ^n\rightarrow Σ^m,$ encoding \emph{messages} in $Σ^n$ to \emph{codewords} in $Σ^m$, with super-fast decoding algorithms. They are important mathematical objects in many areas of theoretical computer science, yet the best constructions so far have codeword length $m$ that is super-polynomial in $n$, for codes with constant query complexity and constant alphabet size.
  In a very surprising result, Ben-Sasson, Goldreich, Harsha, Sudan, and Vadhan (SICOMP 2006) show how to construct a relaxed version of LDCs (RLDCs) with constant query complexity and almost linear codeword length over the binary alphabet, and used them to obtain significantly-improved constructions of Probabilistically Checkable Proofs.
  In this work, we study RLDCs in the standard Hamming-error setting. We prove an exponential lower bound on the length of Hamming RLDCs making $2$ queries (even adaptively) over the binary alphabet. This answers a question explicitly raised by Gur and Lachish (SICOMP 2021) and is the first exponential lower bound for RLDCs. Combined with the results of Ben-Sasson et al., our result exhibits a ``phase-transition''-type behavior on the codeword length for some constant-query complexity. We achieve these lower bounds via a transformation of RLDCs to standard Hamming LDCs, using a careful analysis of restrictions of message bits that fix codeword bits.

Motivation: 在以往的编码理论中，最小距离仅能决定可纠正的错误数量，而高度分布能提供更精细的错误处理能力描述，特别是在处理特定大小的加性错误时能更好地控制异常错误检测和定位。

Conclusion: 本文对高度分布概念进行了深入研究，提出并验证了多种计算表征方法，为编码理论在可靠性建模中的应用提供了更精细的工具，扩展了编码理论在异常错误处理方面的能力分析维度。

Abstract: In recent work, it has been shown that maintaining reliability in analog vector--matrix multipliers can be modeled as the following coding problem. Vectors in $\mathbb{R}^k$ are encoded into codewords of a linear $[n,k,d]$ code $C$ over $\mathbb{R}$. For prescribed positive reals $δ< Δ$, additive errors of magnitude at most $δ$ are tolerable and need no handling, yet outlying errors of magnitude greater than $Δ$ are to be located or detected. The trade-off between the ratio $Δ/δ$ and the number of outlying errors that can be handled is determined by the height profile of $C$; as such, the height profile provides a finer description of the error handling capability of $C$, compared to the minimum distance $d$, which only determines the number of correctable errors. This work contains a further study of the notion of the height profile. Several characterizations of the height profile are presented, thereby yielding methods for computing it. The starting point is formulating this computation as an optimization problem that is solved by a set of linear programs. This, in turn, leads to a combinatorial characterization of the height profile as a maximum (or max--min) over a certain finite set of codewords of $C$. Moreover, this characterization is shown to have a simple geometric interpretation when the columns of the generator matrix of $C$ all have the same $L_2$ norm. Through examples of several code families, it is demonstrated how the results herein can be used to compute the height profile explicitly.

Abstract: Permutation decoding is a process that utilizes the permutation automorphism group of a linear code to correct errors in received words. Given a received word, a set of automorphisms, called a PD set, moves errors out of the information positions so that the original message can be determined. In this paper, we investigate permutation decoding for certain families of algebraic geometry codes. Automorphisms of the underlying curve are used to specify permutation automorphisms of the code. Specifically, we describe permutation decoding sets that correct specific burst errors for one-point codes on Hermitian and norm-trace curves.

Abstract: The joint optimization of the integer matrix $\mathbf{A}$ and the power scaling matrix $\mathbf{D}$ is central to achieving the capacity-approaching performance of Integer-Forcing (IF) precoding. This problem, however, is known to be NP-hard, presenting a fundamental computational bottleneck. In this paper, we reveal that the solution space of this problem admits a intrinsic geometric structure: it can be partitioned into a finite number of conical regions, each associated with a distinct full-rank integer matrix $\mathbf{A}$. Leveraging this decomposition, we transform the NP-hard problem into a search over these regions and propose the Multi-Cone Nested Stochastic Pattern Search (MCN-SPS) algorithm. Our main theoretical result is that MCN-SPS finds a near-optimal solution with a computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}\left(K^4\log K\log_2(r_0)\right)$, which is polynomial in the number of users $K$. Numerical simulations corroborate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate the algorithm's efficacy.

Abstract: In continuous aperture arrays (CAPAs), careful consideration of the underlying physics is essential, among which electromagnetic (EM) mutual coupling plays a critical role in beamforming performance. Building on a physically consistent mutual coupling model, the beamforming design is formulated as a functional optimization whose optimality condition leads to a Fredholm integral equation. The incorporation of the coupling model, however, substantially increases computational complexity, necessitating efficient and accurate integral equation solvers. In this letter, we propose two efficient solvers: 1) a coordinate-transformation-based kernel approximation that preserves the operator structure while alleviating discretization demands, and 2) a direct lower-upper (LU)-based solver that stably handles the Nyström-discretized system. Numerical results demonstrate improved accuracy and reduced computational overhead compared to conventional methods, with the LU-based solver emerging as an efficient and scalable solution for large-scale CAPA optimization via offline factorization.

Abstract: This paper proves that any quantum t-deletion-correcting codes also correct a total of t insertion and deletion errors under a certain condition.

In addition, this paper proposes the quantum indel distance and describes insertion and deletion errors correcting capability of quantum codes by this distance.

Abstract: The space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) has garnered significant attention in recent years due to its capability to extend communication networks from terrestrial environments to near-ground and space contexts. The application of SAGIN enables to achieve a high-quality, multi-functional, and complex communication requirements, which are essential for sixth-generation communication systems. This paper presents a topology aware (TA) framework to leverage the topological structure in SAGIN to address the multi-functional communication challenge, particularly the integrated sensing, communication, and power transfer (ISCPT) problem. To take advantage of the topological structure, we initially establish the topology according to the criteria of visibility and channel strength. The ISCPT problem can be reformulated into a topological structure as a mixed integer linear program, providing valuable insights from the objectives and constraints. Results demonstrate the superior performance of our solution compared to the benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper introduces delay-alignment modulation (DAM) for secure integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). Due to the broadcast nature of multi-user downlinks, communications are vulnerable to eavesdropping. DAM applies controlled per-path symbol delays at the transmitter to coherently align the multipath components at the intended user, enhancing the received signal power, while simultaneously creating delay misalignment at the eavesdropper (Eve). To mitigate sensing degradation caused by multipath propagation, we propose a two-stage protocol that first estimates the angle and then the delay of the line-of-sight (LoS) path after suppressing multipath interference. We derive the secrecy spectral efficiency (SSE) and the Cramer-Rao (CRB) of the target delay. Finally, we develop a path-based zero-forcing (ZF) precoding framework and formulate a max-min SSE design under CRB and power constraints. Simulation results show DAM significantly outperforms the strongest-path (SP) benchmark in terms of SSE, while meeting sensing requirements, since intentional delay alignment at legitimate users degrades reception at Eve.

Abstract: While tensor-based methods excel at Direction-of-Arrival (DOA) estimation, their performance degrades severely with faulty or sparse arrays that violate the required manifold structure. To address this challenge, we propose Tensor Completion for Defective Arrays (TCDA), a robust algorithm that reformulates the physical imperfection problem as a data recovery task within a virtual tensor space. We present a detailed derivation for constructing an incomplete third-order Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) tensor from the faulty array signals via subarray partitioning, cross-correlation, and dimensional reshaping. Leveraging the tensor's inherent low-rank structure, an Alternating Least Squares (ALS)-based algorithm directly recovers the factor matrices embedding the DOA parameters from the incomplete observations. This approach provides a software-defined 'self-healing' capability, demonstrating exceptional robustness against random element failures without requiring additional processing steps for DOA estimation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Pinching antenna systems (PASS) have recently emerged as a promising architecture for high-frequency wireless communications. In this letter, we investigate localization in PASS by jointly exploiting the received signal amplitude and phase information, unlike recent works that consider only the amplitude information. A complex baseband signal model is formulated to capture free-space path loss, waveguide attenuation, and distance-dependent phase rotation between the user and each pinching antenna. Using this model, we derive the Fisher information matrix (FIM) with respect to the user location and obtain closed-form expressions for the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) and the position error bound (PEB). A maximum likelihood (ML) estimator that jointly considers the received signal amplitude and phase is developed to estimate the unknown user location. Given the non-convexity of the estimation problem, a two-stage solution combining coarse grid search and Levenberg-Marquardt refinement is proposed. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed phase-aware estimator outperforms existing amplitude-only method in terms of positioning accuracy.

Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems have recently emerged as a promising solution for enhancing coverage in high-frequency wireless communications by guiding signals through dielectric waveguides and radiating them via position-adjustable antennas. However, their practical deployment is fundamentally constrained by waveguide attenuation and line-installation requirements, which limit the achievable coverage range. To address this challenge, this paper investigates a wireless-fed pinching-antenna architecture that employs highly directional horn antennas to enable efficient coverage extension. Specifically, a full-duplex amplify-and-forward relay equipped with horn antennas is introduced between the base station and the waveguide input, which significantly improves the link budget in high-frequency bands while effectively eliminating self-interference. On this basis, we formulate a total power minimization problem subject to a quality-of-service constraint at the user equipment, involving the joint optimization of the pinching-antenna position, the relay amplification gain, and the base station transmit power. By exploiting the structure of the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio, the optimal pinching-antenna position is first obtained in closed form by balancing waveguide attenuation and free-space path loss. Subsequently, closed-form expressions for the optimal relay gain and transmit power are derived. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme substantially outperforms conventional systems without relaying and relay-assisted transmission with fixed antennas in terms of total power consumption.

Abstract: We present StochasticBarrier.jl, an open-source Julia-based toolbox for generating Stochastic Barrier Functions (SBFs) for safety verification of discrete-time stochastic systems with additive Gaussian noise. StochasticBarrier.jl certifies linear, polynomial, and piecewise affine (PWA) systems. The latter enables verification for a wide range of system dynamics, including general nonlinear types. The toolbox implements a Sum-of-Squares (SOS) optimization approach, as well as methods based on piecewise constant (PWC) functions. For SOS-based SBFs, StochasticBarrier.jl leverages semi-definite programming solvers, while for PWC SBFs, it offers three engines: two using linear programming (LP) and one based on gradient descent (GD). Benchmarking StochasticBarrier.jl against the state-of-the-art shows that the tool outperforms existing tools in computation time, safety probability bounds, and scalability across over 30 case studies. Compared to its closest competitor, StochasticBarrier.jl is up to four orders of magnitude faster, achieves significant safety probability improvements, and supports higher-dimensional systems.

Abstract: The energy transition requires flexible technologies to maintain grid stability, and electrolyzers are playing an increasingly important role in meeting this need. While previous studies often question the dynamic capabilities of large-scale alkaline electrolyzer systems, we assess their potential to provide balancing services using real manufacturer data. Unlike common approaches, we propose the decoupling between the total electrolyzer power and a smaller fractions of power actually offered on balancing markets. Adapting an existing methodology, we analyze alkaline electrolyzer systems and extend the assessment to Germany and Europe. Our results show that large-scale electrolyzers are technically capable of delivering fast-response balancing services, with significantly lower dynamic requirements than previously assumed. The planned electrolyzers in Germany could cover the entire balancing capacity market, potentially saving around 13 % of their electricity costs, excluding energy balancing revenues. The decoupling also resolves part of the trade-off for electrolyzer manufacturers, enabling the design of less dynamic but more stable systems.

Abstract: Early diagnosis of battery thermal anomalies is crucial to ensure safe and reliable battery operation by preventing catastrophic thermal failures. Battery diagnostics primarily rely on battery surface temperature measurements and/or estimation of core temperatures. However, aging-induced changes in the battery model and limited training data remain major challenges for model-based and machine-learning based battery state estimation and diagnostics. To address these issues, we propose a Kolomogorov-Arnold network (KAN) in conjunction with a Koopman-based detection algorithm that leverages the unique advantages of both methods. Firstly, the lightweight KAN provides a model-free estimation of the core temperature to ensure rapid detection of battery thermal anomalies. Secondly, the Koopman operator is learned in real time using the estimated core temperature from KAN and the measured surface temperature of the battery to provide a prediction for diagnostic residual generation. This online learning approach overcomes the challenges of model changes, while the integrated structure reduces the dependence on large datasets. Furthermore, we derive analytical conditions that provide diagnostic guarantees on our KAN-Koopman detection scheme. Our simulation results illustrate a significant reduction in detection time with the proposed algorithm compared to the baseline Koopman-only algorithm.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Large Language Model (LLM)-based autonomous agents is reshaping the digital landscape toward an emerging Agentic Web, where increasingly specialized agents must collaborate to accomplish complex tasks. However, existing collaboration paradigms are constrained to message passing, leaving execution environments as isolated silos. This creates a context gap: agents cannot directly manipulate files or invoke tools in a peer's environment, and must instead resort to costly, error-prone environment reconstruction. We introduce the Agent Workspace Collaboration Protocol (AWCP), which bridges this gap through temporary workspace delegation inspired by the Unix philosophy that everything is a file. AWCP decouples a lightweight control plane from pluggable transport mechanisms, allowing a Delegator to project its workspace to a remote Executor, who then operates on the shared files directly with unmodified local toolchains. We provide a fully open-source reference implementation with MCP tool integration and validate the protocol through live demonstrations of asymmetric collaboration, where agents with complementary capabilities cooperate through delegated workspaces. By establishing the missing workspace layer in the agentic protocol stack, AWCP paves the way for a universally interoperable agent ecosystem in which collaboration transcends message boundaries. The protocol and reference implementation are publicly available at https://github.com/SII-Holos/awcp.

Motivation: 儿童和青少年超重/肥胖仍是美国主要的公共卫生问题。行为、家庭和社区因素共同影响这一现象，但它们在人群层面的联合预测结构尚未得到充分表征。研究旨在识别美国青少年超重/肥胖的多层次预测因素，并比较统计、机器学习和深度学习模型的预测性能、校准性和亚组公平性。

Method: 使用2021年国家儿童健康调查的18,792名10-17岁儿童数据，基于BMI定义超重/肥胖。预测因素包括饮食、身体活动、睡眠、父母压力、社会经济条件、不良经历和社区特征。比较逻辑回归、随机森林、梯度提升、XGBoost、LightGBM、多层感知机和TabNet等模型，使用AUC、准确率、精确率、召回率、F1分数和Brier分数进行性能评估。

Abstract: Background: Childhood and adolescent overweight and obesity remain major public health concerns in the United States and are shaped by behavioral, household, and community factors. Their joint predictive structure at the population level remains incompletely characterized. Objectives: The study aims to identify multilevel predictors of overweight and obesity among U.S. adolescents and compare the predictive performance, calibration, and subgroup equity of statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models. Data and Methods: We analyze 18,792 children aged 10-17 years from the 2021 National Survey of Children's Health. Overweight/obesity is defined using BMI categories. Predictors included diet, physical activity, sleep, parental stress, socioeconomic conditions, adverse experiences, and neighborhood characteristics. Models include logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, XGBoost, LightGBM, multilayer perceptron, and TabNet. Performance is evaluated using AUC, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and Brier score. Results: Discrimination range from 0.66 to 0.79. Logistic regression, gradient boosting, and MLP showed the most stable balance of discrimination and calibration. Boosting and deep learning modestly improve recall and F1 score. No model was uniformly superior. Performance disparities across race and poverty groups persist across algorithms. Conclusion: Increased model complexity yields limited gains over logistic regression. Predictors consistently span behavioral, household, and neighborhood domains. Persistent subgroup disparities indicate the need for improved data quality and equity-focused surveillance rather than greater algorithmic complexity.

Abstract: Phenotyping is fundamental to rare disease diagnosis, but manual curation of structured phenotypes from clinical notes is labor-intensive and difficult to scale. Existing artificial intelligence approaches typically optimize individual components of phenotyping but do not operationalize the full clinical workflow of extracting features from clinical text, standardizing them to Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms, and prioritizing diagnostically informative HPO terms. We developed RARE-PHENIX, an end-to-end AI framework for rare disease phenotyping that integrates large language model-based phenotype extraction, ontology-grounded standardization to HPO terms, and supervised ranking of diagnostically informative phenotypes. We trained RARE-PHENIX using data from 2,671 patients across 11 Undiagnosed Diseases Network clinical sites, and externally validated it on 16,357 real-world clinical notes from Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Using clinician-curated HPO terms as the gold standard, RARE-PHENIX consistently outperformed a state-of-the-art deep learning baseline (PhenoBERT) across ontology-based similarity and precision-recall-F1 metrics in end-to-end evaluation (i.e., ontology-based similarity of 0.70 vs. 0.58). Ablation analyses demonstrated performance improvements with the addition of each module in RARE-PHENIX (extraction, standardization, and prioritization), supporting the value of modeling the full clinical phenotyping workflow. By modeling phenotyping as a clinically aligned workflow rather than a single extraction task, RARE-PHENIX provides structured, ranked phenotypes that are more concordant with clinician curation and has the potential to support human-in-the-loop rare disease diagnosis in real-world settings.

Abstract: We present DMCD (DataMap Causal Discovery), a two-phase causal discovery framework that integrates LLM-based semantic drafting from variable metadata with statistical validation on observational data. In Phase I, a large language model proposes a sparse draft DAG, serving as a semantically informed prior over the space of possible causal structures. In Phase II, this draft is audited and refined via conditional independence testing, with detected discrepancies guiding targeted edge revisions.
  We evaluate our approach on three metadata-rich real-world benchmarks spanning industrial engineering, environmental monitoring, and IT systems analysis. Across these datasets, DMCD achieves competitive or leading performance against diverse causal discovery baselines, with particularly large gains in recall and F1 score. Probing and ablation experiments suggest that these improvements arise from semantic reasoning over metadata rather than memorization of benchmark graphs. Overall, our results demonstrate that combining semantic priors with principled statistical verification yields a high-performing and practically effective approach to causal structure learning.

Conclusion: 通过将环境机制建模融入扩散模型训练，DMEMM有效解决了轨迹生成的一致性问题，显著提升了离线强化学习规划的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown promising capabilities in trajectory generation for planning in offline reinforcement learning (RL). However, conventional diffusion-based planning methods often fail to account for the fact that generating trajectories in RL requires unique consistency between transitions to ensure coherence in real environments. This oversight can result in considerable discrepancies between the generated trajectories and the underlying mechanisms of a real environment. To address this problem, we propose a novel diffusion-based planning method, termed as Diffusion Modulation via Environment Mechanism Modeling (DMEMM). DMEMM modulates diffusion model training by incorporating key RL environment mechanisms, particularly transition dynamics and reward functions. Experimental results demonstrate that DMEMM achieves state-of-the-art performance for planning with offline reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Real-world requests to AI agents are fundamentally underspecified. Natural human communication relies on shared context and unstated constraints that speakers expect listeners to infer. Current agentic benchmarks test explicit instruction-following but fail to evaluate whether agents can reason about implicit requirements spanning accessibility needs, privacy boundaries, catastrophic risks, and contextual constraints. We present Implicit Intelligence, an evaluation framework testing whether AI agents can move beyond prompt-following to become genuine goal-fulfillers, paired with Agent-as-a-World (AaW), a harness where interactive worlds are defined in human-readable YAML files and simulated by language models. Our scenarios feature apparent simplicity in user requests, hidden complexity in correct solutions, and discoverability of constraints through environmental exploration. Evaluating 16 frontier and open-weight models across 205 scenarios, we find that even the best-performing model achieves only 48.3% scenario pass rate, revealing substantial room for improvement in bridging the gap between literal instruction-following and human-like contextual reasoning.

Motivation: 当前LLM智能体的性能受限于人类设计的工具接口，这些接口在大型工具集中成为瓶颈。现有方法依赖执行追踪数据，但在冷启动或隐私限制场景中不可用，且无法扩展到未见过的工具。

Method: 提出Trace-Free+课程学习框架，从追踪丰富设置逐步转移到零追踪部署，学习可复用的接口使用模式和工具使用结果。构建大规模高质量工具接口数据集支持该方法。

Result: 在StableToolBench和RestBench上的实验显示，在面对未见过的工具时取得稳定提升，具备强大的跨域泛化能力，在候选工具超过100个时仍保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 工具接口优化是智能体微调的有效补充方案，具有实际部署价值，能够解决现有方法在可扩展性和泛化性方面的限制。

Abstract: The performance of LLM-based agents depends not only on the agent itself but also on the quality of the tool interfaces it consumes. While prior work has focused heavily on agent fine-tuning, tool interfaces-including natural language descriptions and parameter schemas-remain largely human-oriented and often become a bottleneck, especially when agents must select from large candidate tool sets. Existing approaches to improving tool interfaces rely on execution traces, which are frequently unavailable in cold-start or privacy-constrained settings, and typically optimize each tool independently, limiting scalability and generalization to unseen tools. We propose Trace-Free+, a curriculum learning framework that progressively transfers supervision from trace-rich settings to trace-free deployment, encouraging the model to abstract reusable interface-usage patterns and tool usage outcomes. To support this approach, we construct a large-scale dataset of high-quality tool interfaces using a structured workflow over a diverse collection of tools. Experiments on StableToolBench and RestBench show consistent gains on unseen tools, strong cross-domain generalization, and robustness as the number of candidate tools scales to over 100, demonstrating that tool interface optimization is a practical and deployable complement to agent fine-tuning.

Abstract: Driven by the increasingly complex and decision-oriented demands of time series analysis, we introduce the Semantic-Conditional Time Series Reasoning task, which extends conventional time series analysis beyond purely numerical modeling to incorporate contextual and semantic understanding. To further enhance the mode's reasoning capabilities on complex time series problems, we propose a two-round reinforcement learning framework: the first round strengthens the mode's perception of fundamental temporal primitives, while the second focuses on semantic-conditioned reasoning. The resulting model, KairosVL, achieves competitive performance across both synthetic and real-world tasks. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that our framework not only boosts performance but also preserves intrinsic reasoning ability and significantly improves generalization to unseen scenarios. To summarize, our work highlights the potential of combining semantic reasoning with temporal modeling and provides a practical framework for real-world time series intelligence, which is in urgent demand.

Abstract: Effective human-AI coordination requires artificial agents capable of exhibiting and responding to human-like behaviors while adapting to changing contexts. Imitation learning has emerged as one of the prominent approaches to build such agents by training them to mimic human-demonstrated behaviors. However, current methods struggle to capture the inherent diversity and non-Markovian nature of human behavior and lack the ability to steer behavior at inference time. Drawing inspiration from the theory of human cognitive processes, where inner speech guides action selection before execution, we propose MIMIC (Modeling Inner Motivations for Imitation and Control), a framework that uses language as an internal representation of behavioral intent. MIMIC employs the novel use of vision-language models as linguistic scaffolding to train a conditional variational autoencoder capable of generating inner speech from observations. A diffusion-based behavior cloning policy then selects actions conditioned on current observations and the generated inner speech. MIMIC enables fine-grained steering of behavior at inference time by conditioning the agent on behavior-specific speech. Experiments across robotic manipulation tasks and human-AI collaboration games demonstrate that MIMIC significantly enhances both behavior diversity and fidelity to human demonstrations while enabling nuanced behavioral steering without training on additional demonstrations. We open source our code and provide pre-trained MIMIC agents and qualitative demos at: https://mimic-research.github.io.

Abstract: Many benchmarks for automated causal inference evaluate a system's performance based on a single numerical output, such as an Average Treatment Effect (ATE). This approach conflates two distinct steps in causal analysis: identification-formulating a valid research design under stated assumptions-and estimation-implementing that design numerically on finite data. We introduce CausalReasoningBenchmark, a benchmark of 173 queries across 138 real-world datasets, curated from 85 peer-reviewed research papers and four widely-used causal-inference textbooks. For each query a system must produce (i) a structured identification specification that names the strategy, the treatment, outcome, and control variables, and all design-specific elements, and (ii) a point estimate with a standard error. By scoring these two components separately, our benchmark enables granular diagnosis: it distinguishes failures in causal reasoning from errors in numerical execution. Baseline results with a state-of-the-art LLM show that, while the model correctly identifies the high-level strategy in 84 % of cases, full identification-specification correctness drops to only 30 %, revealing that the bottleneck lies in the nuanced details of research design rather than in computation. CausalReasoningBenchmark is publicly available on Hugging Face and is designed to foster the development of more robust automated causal-inference systems.

Abstract: The term 'algorithmic fairness' is used to evaluate whether AI models operate fairly in both comparative (where fairness is understood as formal equality, such as "treat like cases as like") and non-comparative (where unfairness arises from the model's inaccuracy, arbitrariness, or inscrutability) contexts. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are breaking new ground in multimodal understanding, reasoning, and generation; however, we argue that inconspicuous distortions arising from complex multimodal interaction dynamics can lead to systematic bias. The purpose of this position paper is twofold: first, it is intended to acquaint AI researchers with phenomenological explainable approaches that rely on the physical entities that the machine experiences during training/inference, as opposed to the traditional cognitivist symbolic account or metaphysical approaches; second, it is to state that this phenomenological doctrine will be practically useful for tackling algorithmic fairness issues in MLLMs. We develop a surrogate physics-based model that describes transformer dynamics (i.e., semantic network structure and self-/cross-attention) to analyze the dynamics of cross-modal bias in MLLM, which are not fully captured by conventional embedding- or representation-level analyses. We support this position through multi-input diagnostic experiments: 1) perturbation-based analyses of emotion classification using Qwen2.5-Omni and Gemma 3n, and 2) dynamical analysis of Lorenz chaotic time-series prediction through the physical surrogate. Across two architecturally distinct MLLMs, we show that multimodal inputs can reinforce modality dominance rather than mitigate it, as revealed by structured error-attractor patterns under systematic label perturbation, complemented by dynamical analysis.

Abstract: AIs are increasingly being deployed with greater autonomy and capabilities, which increases the risk that a misaligned AI may be able to cause catastrophic harm. Untrusted monitoring -- using one untrusted model to oversee another -- is one approach to reducing risk. Justifying the safety of an untrusted monitoring deployment is challenging because developers cannot safely deploy a misaligned model to test their protocol directly. In this paper, we develop upon existing methods for rigorously demonstrating safety based on pre-deployment testing. We relax assumptions that previous AI control research made about the collusion strategies a misaligned AI might use to subvert untrusted monitoring. We develop a taxonomy covering passive self-recognition, causal collusion (hiding pre-shared signals), acausal collusion (hiding signals via Schelling points), and combined strategies. We create a safety case sketch to clearly present our argument, explicitly state our assumptions, and highlight unsolved challenges. We identify conditions under which passive self-recognition could be a more effective collusion strategy than those studied previously. Our work builds towards more robust evaluations of untrusted monitoring.

In this work, we query simultaneously two decision-makers in the aim to elicit their respective value functions. For each query we receive two answers, without noise, but without knowing which answer corresponds to which decision-maker.We propose an elicitation procedure that identifies the two preference models when the marginal value functions are piecewise linear with known breaking points.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in scientific discovery but struggle to bridge the gap between theoretical reasoning and verifiable physical simulation. Existing solutions operate in a passive "execute-then-response" loop and thus lacks runtime perception, obscuring agents to transient anomalies (e.g., numerical instability or diverging oscillations). To address this limitation, we propose EmbodiedAct, a framework that transforms established scientific software into active embodied agents by grounding LLMs in embodied actions with a tight perception-execution loop. We instantiate EmbodiedAct within MATLAB and evaluate it on complex engineering design and scientific modeling tasks. Extensive experiments show that EmbodiedAct significantly outperforms existing baselines, achieving SOTA performance by ensuring satisfactory reliability and stability in long-horizon simulations and enhanced accuracy in scientific modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA模型在部分可观测的长时程操作任务中表现不佳，主要因为它们缺乏持久、动作条件的状态表示，以及有限的时域和物理推理能力。现有方法依赖于短期上下文窗口或重复查询视觉语言模型，导致任务进度丢失、感知混淆下的动作重复以及高推理延迟。

Method: RB-VLA采用基于信念的架构，通过自监督世界模型目标训练，维护一个紧凑的潜在状态编码任务相关历史、动力学和物体交互。视觉语言模型仅提供任务规范，信念追踪任务进度并支持在部分可观测环境下的阶段性感知和因果基础的控制。信念和意图共同调节扩散策略以实现鲁棒闭环执行。

Result: RB-VLA在长时程基准测试中优于现有VLA模型，在多阶段抓放和堆叠任务上成功率分别比π0提高52.5%和37.5%。推理延迟降低达5倍，消除了现有VLA中随时间步增加的内存增长。剥离实验显示信念模块是性能主要驱动力，成功率从32.5%提升到77.5%。

Conclusion: 这些结果证明了基于信念的状态表示对长时程VLA策略的有效性，为视觉语言动作模型在复杂操作任务中的应用提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Current vision-language-action (VLA) models struggle with long-horizon manipulation under partial observability. Most existing approaches remain observation-driven, relying on short context windows or repeated queries to vision-language models (VLMs). This leads to loss of task progress, action repetition under perceptual aliasing, and high inference latency. Semantic reasoning alone is not the primary bottleneck in long-horizon manipulation. Instead, VLAs lack persistent, action-conditioned state representations and exhibit limited temporal and physical reasoning, making them ill-suited for multi-stage control. This paper introduces RB-VLA, a belief-centric architecture trained with self-supervised world-model objectives that maintains a compact latent state encoding task-relevant history, dynamics, and object interactions. Queried once for high-level intent, the VLM provides task specification, while the belief tracks task progress and enables phase-aware, causally grounded control under partial observability without storing raw observations or scaling memory with time. The belief and intent jointly condition a diffusion policy for robust closed-loop execution. RB-VLA outperforms prior VLAs on long-horizon benchmarks, achieving 52.5% and 37.5% higher success on multi-stage pick-and-place and stacking tasks, respectively, compared to π0. It also reduces inference latency by up to 5x relative to baselines and eliminates memory growth across timesteps observed in existing VLAs. Ablations show that the belief module is the primary driver of performance, increasing success rates from 32.5% to 77.5%. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of belief-based state representations for long-horizon VLA policies.

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have shown promise for human-level embodied intelligence. However, existing benchmarks for VLM-driven embodied agents often rely on high-level commands or discretized action spaces, which are non-native settings that differ markedly from real-world control. In addition, current benchmarks focus primarily on high-level tasks and lack joint evaluation and analysis at both low and high levels. To address these limitations, we present NativeEmbodied, a challenging benchmark for VLM-driven embodied agents that uses a unified, native low-level action space. Built on diverse simulated scenes, NativeEmbodied includes three representative high-level tasks in complex scenarios to evaluate overall performance. For more detailed analysis, we further decouple the skills required by complex tasks and construct four types of low-level tasks, each targeting a fundamental embodied skill. This joint evaluation across task and skill granularities enables fine-grained assessment of embodied agents. Experiments with state-of-the-art VLMs reveal clear deficiencies in several fundamental embodied skills, and further analysis shows that these bottlenecks significantly limit performance on high-level tasks. NativeEmbodied highlights key challenges for current VLM-driven embodied agents and provides insights to guide future research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI对齐方法大多依赖训练时的高质量标注数据，计算和标注成本高昂。对比解码方法虽能利用模型内部分布改善特定能力，但其适用范围有限，需要一种能扩展到更广泛行为增强场景的通用方法。

Method: 提出了Polarity-Prompt Contrastive Decoding (PromptCD)方法：针对目标行为构建正负极性的指导提示，对比LLM的token级概率分布和VLM的视觉注意力模式，强化期望行为。该方法无需额外训练，适用于LLM和VLM两种模态。

Result: 在LLM的"3H"对齐目标（helpful、honest、harmless）上取得显著提升，表明预训练模型能在测试时实现自我增强；在VLM上，PromptCD通过强化行为一致的视觉接地显著改善VQA性能。

Conclusion: PromptCD是一种简单、通用且成本高效的跨模态可靠行为控制策略，为AI系统对齐提供了有效的测试时解决方案。

Abstract: Reliable AI systems require large language models (LLMs) to exhibit behaviors aligned with human preferences and values. However, most existing alignment approaches operate at training time and rely on additional high-quality data, incurring significant computational and annotation costs. While recent work has shown that contrastive decoding can leverage a model's internal distributions to improve specific capabilities, its applicability remains limited to narrow behavioral scopes and scenarios. In this work, we introduce Polarity-Prompt Contrastive Decoding (PromptCD), a test-time behavior control method that generalizes contrastive decoding to broader enhancement settings. PromptCD constructs paired positive and negative guiding prompts for a target behavior and contrasts model responses-specifically token-level probability distributions in LLMs and visual attention patterns in VLMs-to reinforce desirable outcomes. This formulation extends contrastive decoding to a wide range of enhancement objectives and is applicable to both LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) without additional training. For LLMs, experiments on the "3H" alignment objectives (helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness) demonstrate consistent and substantial improvements, indicating that post-trained models can achieve meaningful self-enhancement purely at test time. For VLMs, we further analyze contrastive effects on visual attention, showing that PromptCD significantly improves VQA performance by reinforcing behavior-consistent visual grounding. Collectively, these results highlight PromptCD as a simple, general, and cost-efficient strategy for reliable behavior control across modalities.

Conclusion: OAG模型为学习增强在线算法提供了一个统一的理论框架，DTB编译器提供了一种简单而强大的算法转换方法。研究证明这种朴素的方法在多个经典问题上都能获得最优性能，展示了框架的实用性和理论价值，为学习增强算法设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new model for ML-augmented online decision making, called online algorithms with unreliable guidance (OAG). This model completely separates between the predictive and algorithmic components, thus offering a single well-defined analysis framework that relies solely on the considered problem. Formulated through the lens of request-answer games, an OAG algorithm receives, with each incoming request, a piece of guidance which is taken from the problem's answer space; ideally, this guidance is the optimal answer for the current request, however with probability $β$, the guidance is adversarially corrupted. The goal is to develop OAG algorithms that admit good competitiveness when $β= 0$ (a.k.a. consistency) as well as when $β= 1$ (a.k.a. robustness); the appealing notion of smoothness, that in most prior work required a dedicated loss function, now arises naturally as $β$ shifts from $0$ to $1$.
  We then describe a systematic method, called the drop or trust blindly (DTB) compiler, which transforms any online algorithm into a learning-augmented online algorithm in the OAG model. Given a prediction-oblivious online algorithm, its learning-augmented counterpart produced by applying the DTB compiler either follows the incoming guidance blindly or ignores it altogether and proceeds as the initial algorithm would have; the choice between these two alternatives is based on the outcome of a (biased) coin toss. As our main technical contribution, we prove (rigorously) that although remarkably simple, the class of algorithms produced via the DTB compiler includes algorithms with attractive consistency-robustness guarantees for three classic online problems: for caching and uniform metrical task systems our algorithms are optimal, whereas for bipartite matching (with adversarial arrival order), our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Inspecting Chain-of-Thought reasoning is among the most common means of understanding why an LLM produced its output. But well-known problems with CoT faithfulness severely limit what insights can be gained from this practice. In this paper, we introduce a training method called Counterfactual Simulation Training (CST), which aims to improve CoT faithfulness by rewarding CoTs that enable a simulator to accurately predict a model's outputs over counterfactual inputs. We apply CST in two settings: (1) CoT monitoring with cue-based counterfactuals, to detect when models rely on spurious features, reward hack, or are sycophantic, and (2) counterfactual simulation over generic model-based counterfactuals, to encourage models to produce more faithful, generalizable reasoning in the CoT. Experiments with models up to 235B parameters show that CST can substantially improve monitor accuracy on cue-based counterfactuals (by 35 accuracy points) as well as simulatability over generic counterfactuals (by 2 points). We further show that: (1) CST outperforms prompting baselines, (2) rewriting unfaithful CoTs with an LLM is 5x more efficient than RL alone, (3) faithfulness improvements do not generalize to dissuading cues (as opposed to persuading cues), and (4) larger models do not show more faithful CoT out of the box, but they do benefit more from CST. These results suggest that CST can improve CoT faithfulness in general, with promising applications for CoT monitoring.

Abstract: Traditional on-policy Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) frameworks suffer from experience waste and reward homogeneity, which directly hinders learning efficiency on difficult samples during large language models post-training. In this paper, we introduce Batch Adaptation Policy Optimization (BAPO), an off-policy RLVR framework to improve the data efficiency in large language models post-training. It dynamically selects training batches by re-evaluating historically difficult samples and reusing high-quality ones, while holding a lower bound guarantee for policy improvement. Extensive experiments further demonstrate that BAPO achieves an average 12.5% improvement over GRPO across mathematics, planning, and visual reasoning tasks. Crucially, BAPO successfully resolves 40.7% of problems that base models consistently fail to solve.

Abstract: Multimodal recommendation enhances ranking by integrating user-item interactions with item content, which is particularly effective under sparse feedback and long-tail distributions. However, multimodal signals are inherently heterogeneous and can conflict in specific contexts, making effective fusion both crucial and challenging. Existing approaches often rely on shared fusion pathways, leading to entangled representations and modality imbalance. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{MAGNET}, a \textbf{M}odality-Guided Mixture of \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{G}raph Experts \textbf{N}etwork with Progressive \textbf{E}ntropy-\textbf{T}riggered Routing for Multimodal Recommendation, designed to enhance controllability, stability, and interpretability in multimodal fusion. MAGNET couples interaction-conditioned expert routing with structure-aware graph augmentation, so that both \emph{what} to fuse and \emph{how} to fuse are explicitly controlled and interpretable. At the representation level, a dual-view graph learning module augments the interaction graph with content-induced edges, improving coverage for sparse and long-tail items while preserving collaborative structure via parallel encoding and lightweight fusion. At the fusion level, MAGNET employs structured experts with explicit modality roles -- dominant, balanced, and complementary -- enabling a more interpretable and adaptive combination of behavioral, visual, and textual cues. To further stabilize sparse routing and prevent expert collapse, we introduce a two-stage entropy-weighting mechanism that monitors routing entropy. This mechanism automatically transitions training from an early coverage-oriented regime to a later specialization-oriented regime, progressively balancing expert utilization and routing confidence. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines.

Abstract: Reward design has been one of the central challenges for real world reinforcement learning (RL) deployment, especially in settings with multiple objectives. Preference-based RL offers an appealing alternative by learning from human preferences over pairs of behavioural outcomes. More recently, RL from AI feedback (RLAIF) has demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) can generate preference labels at scale, mitigating the reliance on human annotators. However, existing RLAIF work typically focuses only on single-objective tasks, leaving the open question of how RLAIF handles systems that involve multiple objectives. In such systems trade-offs among conflicting objectives are difficult to specify, and policies risk collapsing into optimizing for a dominant goal. In this paper, we explore the extension of the RLAIF paradigm to multi-objective self-adaptive systems. We show that multi-objective RLAIF can produce policies that yield balanced trade-offs reflecting different user priorities without laborious reward engineering. We argue that integrating RLAIF into multi-objective RL offers a scalable path toward user-aligned policy learning in domains with inherently conflicting objectives.

Abstract: Long-context LLMs demand accurate inference at low latency, yet decoding becomes primarily constrained by KV cache as context grows. Prior pruning methods are largely context-agnostic: their token selection ignores step-wise relevance and local semantics, which undermines quality. Moreover, their irregular accesses and selection overheads yield only limited wall-clock speedups. To address this, we propose \textbf{CHESS}, an \textit{algorithm-system co-design} KV-cache management system. Algorithmically, CHESS introduces a context-aware, hierarchical selection policy that dynamically reconstructs a coherent context for the current decoding. System-wise, coarse granularity selection eliminates expensive data movement, fully realizing practical acceleration from theoretical sparsity. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that CHESS surpasses Full-KV quality using only \textbf{1\%} of the KV cache, delivers low-latency stable inference with up to \textbf{4.56$\times$} higher throughput, and consistently outperforms other strong baselines.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning for agentic multimodal models often suffers from interaction collapse, where models learn to reduce tool usage and multi-turn reasoning, limiting the benefits of agentic behavior. We introduce PyVision-RL, a reinforcement learning framework for open-weight multimodal models that stabilizes training and sustains interaction. Our approach combines an oversampling-filtering-ranking rollout strategy with an accumulative tool reward to prevent collapse and encourage multi-turn tool use. Using a unified training pipeline, we develop PyVision-Image and PyVision-Video for image and video understanding. For video reasoning, PyVision-Video employs on-demand context construction, selectively sampling task-relevant frames during reasoning to significantly reduce visual token usage. Experiments show strong performance and improved efficiency, demonstrating that sustained interaction and on-demand visual processing are critical for scalable multimodal agents.

Motivation: 随着建筑行业数字化转型，BIM设计成为智能建造的关键驱动力。尽管大型语言模型在促进BIM设计方面展现潜力，但缺乏特定数据集和评估基准的问题严重阻碍了LLM在该领域的性能发展。

Method: 1)提出了BIM设计评估基准和量化指标；2)开发了从BIM生成文本数据并构建BIM衍生数据集的方法；3)设计了针对BIM设计的微调策略，开发了Qwen-BIM模型。

Result: 领域特定基准能有效全面评估LLM能力，通用LLM对领域特定任务仍显不足。Qwen-BIM的G-Eval评分相比基础模型提升21.0%，仅14B参数的Qwen-BIM在BIM设计任务上表现与671B参数通用LLM相当。

Conclusion: 本研究通过引入综合基准和高质量数据集，开发了首个针对BIM设计的领域特定LLM，为开发各领域BIM相关LLM奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: As the construction industry advances toward digital transformation, BIM (Building Information Modeling)-based design has become a key driver supporting intelligent construction. Despite Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in promoting BIM-based design, the lack of specific datasets and LLM evaluation benchmarks has significantly hindered the performance of LLMs. Therefore, this paper addresses this gap by proposing: 1) an evaluation benchmark for BIM-based design together with corresponding quantitative indicators to evaluate the performance of LLMs, 2) a method for generating textual data from BIM and constructing corresponding BIM-derived datasets for LLM evaluation and fine-tuning, and 3) a fine-tuning strategy to adapt LLMs for BIM-based design. Results demonstrate that the proposed domain-specific benchmark effectively and comprehensively assesses LLM capabilities, highlighting that general LLMs are still incompetent for domain-specific tasks. Meanwhile, with the proposed benchmark and datasets, Qwen-BIM is developed and achieves a 21.0% average increase in G-Eval score compared to the base LLM model. Notably, with only 14B parameters, performance of Qwen-BIM is comparable to that of general LLMs with 671B parameters for BIM-based design tasks. Overall, this study develops the first domain-specific LLM for BIM-based design by introducing a comprehensive benchmark and high-quality dataset, which provide a solid foundation for developing BIM-related LLMs in various fields.

Abstract: Evaluating alignment in language models requires testing how they behave under realistic pressure, not just what they claim they would do. While alignment failures increasingly cause real-world harm, comprehensive evaluation frameworks with realistic multi-turn scenarios remain lacking. We introduce an alignment benchmark spanning 904 scenarios across six categories -- Honesty, Safety, Non-Manipulation, Robustness, Corrigibility, and Scheming -- validated as realistic by human raters. Our scenarios place models under conflicting instructions, simulated tool access, and multi-turn escalation to reveal behavioural tendencies that single-turn evaluations miss. Evaluating 24 frontier models using LLM judges validated against human annotations, we find that even top-performing models exhibit gaps in specific categories, while the majority of models show consistent weaknesses across the board. Factor analysis reveals that alignment behaves as a unified construct (analogous to the g-factor in cognitive research) with models scoring high on one category tending to score high on others. We publicly release the benchmark and an interactive leaderboard to support ongoing evaluation, with plans to expand scenarios in areas where we observe persistent weaknesses and to add new models as they are released.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大视觉语言模型在视觉问答任务中表现出色，但往往依赖虚假相关性而非真正的因果推理。现有评估主要关注答案正确性，而无法确定失败是由于推理能力不足还是未能识别因果相关信息。

Method: 引入视觉语言因果图作为结构化的查询条件表示，明确编码因果相关的对象、属性、关系和场景假设。基于此提出ViLCaR诊断基准，包含因果归因、因果推理和问答三个任务，并设计图对齐的评估指标来衡量相关性识别能力。

Result: 实验表明，为最先进的大视觉语言模型注入结构化相关性信息，相比零样本学习和标准上下文学习，能显著提高归因和推理的一致性。

Conclusion: 当前大视觉语言模型在因果推理方面的限制主要源于缺乏结构化指导，而非推理能力不足。结构化表示能有效提升模型的因果推理性能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve strong performance on visual question answering benchmarks, yet often rely on spurious correlations rather than genuine causal reasoning. Existing evaluations primarily assess the correctness of the answers, making it unclear whether failures arise from limited reasoning capability or from misidentifying causally relevant information. We introduce Vision-Language Causal Graphs (VLCGs), a structured, query-conditioned representation that explicitly encodes causally relevant objects, attributes, relations, and scene-grounded assumptions. Building on this representation, we present ViLCaR, a diagnostic benchmark comprising tasks for Causal Attribution, Causal Inference, and Question Answering, along with graph-aligned evaluation metrics that assess relevance identification beyond final answer accuracy. Experiments in state-of-the-art LVLMs show that injecting structured relevance information significantly improves attribution and inference consistency compared to zero-shot and standard in-context learning. These findings suggest that current limitations in LVLM causal reasoning stem primarily from insufficient structural guidance rather than a lack of reasoning capacity.

Motivation: 本研究旨在探索视觉语境对人类和大型语言模型句子可接受性判断的影响，比较文本语境和视觉语境的不同效应，以及LLM与人类处理句子的异同。

Method: 通过实验评估人类和不同LLM在多模态语境下的句子可接受性判断，分析视觉语境对判断的影响，并比较LLM预测与人类评分的相关性。

Result: 视觉图像对人类可接受性评分影响很小；LLM在视觉语境中表现出压缩效应，且无视觉语境时预测人类判断的准确性更高；不同LLM的判断分布存在差异，Qwen最接近人类模式；视觉语境会降低LLM生成预测与其对数概率之间的相关性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了人类与LLM在多模态语境下处理句子的相似点和差异点，视觉语境对LLM的内部表示和生成预测之间存在差距，这为理解LLM的多模态处理机制提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Previous work has examined the capacity of deep neural networks (DNNs), particularly transformers, to predict human sentence acceptability judgments, both independently of context, and in document contexts. We consider the effect of prior exposure to visual images (i.e., visual context) on these judgments for humans and large language models (LLMs). Our results suggest that, in contrast to textual context, visual images appear to have little if any impact on human acceptability ratings. However, LLMs display the compression effect seen in previous work on human judgments in document contexts. Different sorts of LLMs are able to predict human acceptability judgments to a high degree of accuracy, but in general, their performance is slightly better when visual contexts are removed. Moreover, the distribution of LLM judgments varies among models, with Qwen resembling human patterns, and others diverging from them. LLM-generated predictions on sentence acceptability are highly correlated with their normalised log probabilities in general. However, the correlations decrease when visual contexts are present, suggesting that a higher gap exists between the internal representations of LLMs and their generated predictions in the presence of visual contexts. Our experimental work suggests interesting points of similarity and of difference between human and LLM processing of sentences in multimodal contexts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with inherent knowledge boundaries and hallucinations, limiting their reliability in knowledge-intensive tasks. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues, it frequently overlooks structural interdependencies essential for multi-hop reasoning. Graph-based RAG approaches attempt to bridge this gap, yet they typically face trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency due to challenges such as costly graph traversals and semantic noise in LLM-generated summaries. In this paper, we propose HyperNode Expansion and Logical Path-Guided Evidence Localization strategies for GraphRAG (HELP), a novel framework designed to balance accuracy with practical efficiency through two core strategies: 1) HyperNode Expansion, which iteratively chains knowledge triplets into coherent reasoning paths abstracted as HyperNodes to capture complex structural dependencies and ensure retrieval accuracy; and 2) Logical Path-Guided Evidence Localization, which leverages precomputed graph-text correlations to map these paths directly to the corpus for superior efficiency. HELP avoids expensive random walks and semantic distortion, preserving knowledge integrity while drastically reducing retrieval latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HELP achieves competitive performance across multiple simple and multi-hop QA benchmarks and up to a 28.8$\times$ speedup over leading Graph-based RAG baselines.

Abstract: The paradigm of Large Language Models is undergoing a fundamental transition from static inference engines to dynamic autonomous cognitive systems.While current research primarily focuses on scaling context windows or optimizing prompt engineering the theoretical bridge between micro scale token processing and macro scale systemic intelligence remains fragmented.This paper proposes AgentOS,a holistic conceptual framework that redefines the LLM as a "Reasoning Kernel" governed by structured operating system logic.Central to this architecture is Deep Context Management which conceptualizes the context window as an Addressable Semantic Space rather than a passive buffer.We systematically deconstruct the transition from discrete sequences to coherent cognitive states introducing mechanisms for Semantic Slicing and Temporal Alignment to mitigate cognitive drift in multi-agent orchestration.By mapping classical OS abstractions such as memory paging interrupt handling and process scheduling onto LLM native constructs, this review provides a rigorous roadmap for architecting resilient scalable and self-evolving cognitive environments.Our analysis asserts that the next frontier of AGI development lies in the architectural efficiency of system-level coordination.

Abstract: Evaluations of large language models (LLMs) primarily emphasize convergent logical reasoning, where success is defined by producing a single correct proof. However, many real-world reasoning problems admit multiple valid derivations, requiring models to explore diverse logical paths rather than committing to one route. To address this limitation, we introduce LogicGraph, the first benchmark aimed to systematically evaluate multi-path logical reasoning, constructed via a neuro-symbolic framework that leverages backward logic generation and semantic instantiation. This pipeline yields solver-verified reasoning problems formalized by high-depth multi-path reasoning and inherent logical distractions, where each instance is associated with an exhaustive set of minimal proofs. We further propose a reference-free evaluation framework to rigorously assess model performance in both convergent and divergent regimes. Experiments on state-of-the-art language models reveal a common limitation: models tend to commit early to a single route and fail to explore alternatives, and the coverage gap grows substantially with reasoning depth. LogicGraph exposes this divergence gap and provides actionable insights to motivate future improvements. Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/kkkkarry/LogicGraph.

Abstract: The Diligent Learner framework suggests LLMs can achieve superintelligence via test-time search, provided a sufficient step-success probability $γ$. In this work, we design a benchmark to measure $γ$ on logical out-of-distribution inference. We construct a class of tasks involving GF(2) circuit reconstruction that grow more difficult with each reasoning step, and that are, from an information-theoretic standpoint, impossible to reliably solve unless the LLM carefully integrates all of the information provided. Our analysis demonstrates that while the $γ$ value for small LLMs declines superlinearly as depth increases, frontier models exhibit partial robustness on this task. Furthermore, we find that successful reasoning at scale is contingent upon precise tool calls, identifying tool design as a critical capability for LLMs to achieve general superintelligence through the Diligent Learner framework.

Abstract: This work introduces a novel training paradigm that draws from affective neuroscience. Inspired by the interplay of emotions and cognition in the human brain and more specifically the SEEKING motivational state, we design a dual-model framework where a smaller base model is trained continuously, while a larger motivated model is activated intermittently during predefined "motivation conditions". The framework mimics the emotional state of high curiosity and anticipation of reward in which broader brain regions are recruited to enhance cognitive performance. Exploiting scalable architectures where larger models extend smaller ones, our method enables shared weight updates and selective expansion of network capacity during noteworthy training steps. Empirical evaluation on the image classification task demonstrates that, not only does the alternating training scheme efficiently and effectively enhance the base model compared to a traditional scheme, in some cases, the motivational model also surpasses its standalone counterpart despite seeing less data per epoch. This opens the possibility of simultaneously training two models tailored to different deployment constraints with competitive or superior performance while keeping training cost lower than when training the larger model.

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) enable the integration and representation of complex information across domains, but their semantic richness and structural complexity create substantial barriers for lay users without expertise in semantic web technologies. When encountering an unfamiliar KG, such users face a distinct orientation challenge: they do not know what questions are possible, how the knowledge is structured, or how to begin exploration. This paper identifies and theorises this phenomenon as the Initial Exploration Problem (IEP). Drawing on theories from information behaviour and human-computer interaction, including ASK, exploratory search, information foraging, and cognitive load theory, we develop a conceptual framing of the IEP characterised by three interdependent barriers: scope uncertainty, ontology opacity, and query incapacity. We argue that these barriers converge at the moment of first contact, distinguishing the IEP from related concepts that presuppose an existing starting point or information goal. Analysing KG exploration interfaces at the level of interaction primitives, we suggest that many systems rely on epistemic assumptions that do not hold at first contact. This reveals a structural gap in the design space: the absence of interaction primitives for scope revelation, mechanisms that communicate what a KG contains without requiring users to formulate queries or interpret ontological structures. In articulating the IEP, this paper provides a theoretical lens for evaluating KG interfaces and for designing entry-point scaffolding that supports initial exploration.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly used to solve complex tasks involving tool use, such as web browsing, code execution, and data analysis. However, current evaluation benchmarks do not adequately assess their ability to solve real-world tasks that require synthesizing information from multiple sources and inferring insights beyond simple fact retrieval. To address this, we introduce DEEPSYNTH, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate agents on realistic, time-consuming problems that combine information gathering, synthesis, and structured reasoning to produce insights. DEEPSYNTH contains 120 tasks collected across 7 domains and data sources covering 67 countries. DEEPSYNTH is constructed using a multi-stage data collection pipeline that requires annotators to collect official data sources, create hypotheses, perform manual analysis, and design tasks with verifiable answers. When evaluated on DEEPSYNTH, 11 state-of-the-art LLMs and deep research agents achieve a maximum F1 score of 8.97 and 17.5 on the LLM-judge metric, underscoring the difficulty of the benchmark. Our analysis reveals that current agents struggle with hallucinations and reasoning over large information spaces, highlighting DEEPSYNTH as a crucial benchmark for guiding future research.

Abstract: Accurate interpretation of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals is crucial for diagnosing cardiovascular diseases. Recent multimodal approaches that integrate ECGs with accompanying clinical reports show strong potential, but they still face two main concerns from a modality perspective: (1) intra-modality: existing models process ECGs in a lead-agnostic manner, overlooking spatial-temporal dependencies across leads, which restricts their effectiveness in modeling fine-grained diagnostic patterns; (2) inter-modality: existing methods directly align ECG signals with clinical reports, introducing modality-specific biases due to the free-text nature of the reports. In light of these two issues, we propose CG-DMER, a contrastive-generative framework for disentangled multimodal ECG representation learning, powered by two key designs: (1) Spatial-temporal masked modeling is designed to better capture fine-grained temporal dynamics and inter-lead spatial dependencies by applying masking across both spatial and temporal dimensions and reconstructing the missing information. (2) A representation disentanglement and alignment strategy is designed to mitigate unnecessary noise and modality-specific biases by introducing modality-specific and modality-shared encoders, ensuring a clearer separation between modality-invariant and modality-specific representations. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that CG-DMER achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse downstream tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前VLA模型需要大量数据集收集和密集推理标注，成本高昂。NORD旨在同时解决这两个挑战，用更少的训练数据和无需推理标注实现竞争性性能。

Method: 1）使用<60%的数据量进行微调，无需推理标注，token数量减少3倍；2）采用Dr. GRPO算法（针对LLM难度偏差优化）来克服标准GRPO在小规模无推理数据集上的局限性。

Result: 在Waymo和NAVSIM基准上实现竞争性性能，训练数据量显著减少且无推理开销。

Conclusion: NORD通过高效数据利用和Dr. GRPO算法解决了VLA模型的数据需求和标注成本问题，为更高效的自动驾驶系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are advancing autonomous driving by replacing modular pipelines with unified end-to-end architectures. However, current VLAs face two expensive requirements: (1) massive dataset collection, and (2) dense reasoning annotations. In this work, we address both challenges with \modelname (\textbf{No} \textbf{R}easoning for \textbf{D}riving). Compared to existing VLAs, \modelname achieves competitive performance while being fine-tuned on $<$60\% of the data and no reasoning annotations, resulting in 3$\times$ fewer tokens. We identify that standard Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) fails to yield significant improvements when applied to policies trained on such small, reasoning-free datasets. We show that this limitation stems from difficulty bias, which disproportionately penalizes reward signals from scenarios that produce high-variance rollouts within GRPO. \modelname overcomes this by incorporating Dr.~GRPO, a recent algorithm designed to mitigate difficulty bias in LLMs. As a result, \modelname achieves competitive performance on Waymo and NAVSIM with a fraction of the training data and no reasoning overhead, enabling more efficient autonomous systems.

Abstract: Recent advances in multi-instance learning (MIL) have witnessed impressive performance in whole slide image (WSI) analysis. However, the inherent sparsity of tumors and their morphological diversity lead to obvious heterogeneity across regions, posing significant challenges in aggregating high-quality and discriminative representations. To address this, we introduce a novel concept of anchor instance (AI), a compact subset of instances that are representative within their regions (local) and discriminative at the bag (global) level. These AIs act as semantic references to guide interactions across regions, correcting non-discriminative patterns while preserving regional diversity. Specifically, we propose a dual-level anchor mining (DAM) module to \textbf{select} AIs from massive instances, where the most informative AI in each region is extracted by assessing its similarity to both local and global embeddings. Furthermore, to ensure completeness and diversity, we devise an anchor-guided region correction (ARC) module that explores the complementary information from all regions to \textbf{correct} each regional representation. Building upon DAM and ARC, we develop a concise yet effective framework, AINet, which employs a simple predictor and surpasses state-of-the-art methods with substantially fewer FLOPs and parameters. Moreover, both DAM and ARC are modular and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MIL frameworks, consistently improving their performance.

TL;DR: 定向T2-FLAIR缺失训练能提升胶质母细胞瘤MR图像分割在缺少T2-FLAIR时的鲁棒性，且不影响T2-FLAIR可用时的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在MRI图像分割中，处理缺失T2-FLAIR序列的情况，而不影响T2-FLAIR可用时的精度

Method: 基于BraTS2021训练nnU-Net模型，使用定向T2-FLAIR缺失训练（概率r=0.35或0.50），在UPenn-GBM上外部测试，评估T2-FLAIR存在和缺失两种情况

Result: T2-FLAIR存在时，缺失训练与无缺失训练的DSC性能相当（中位数94.8% vs 95.0%）；T2-FLAIR缺失时，DSC从81.0%提升至93.4%，水肿分割DSC从14.0%大幅提升至87.0%

Conclusion: 定向T2-FLAIR缺失训练能在T2FLAIR可用时保持性能，在T2-FLAIR缺失时显著减少分割误差和整体肿瘤体积偏差

Abstract: Purpose: To determine whether targeted T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T2-FLAIR) dropout training improves glioblastoma MRI tumor segmentation robustness to missing T2-FLAIR without degrading performance when T2-FLAIR is available. Materials and Methods: This retrospective multi-dataset study developed nnU-Net models on BraTS 2021 (n=848) and externally tested them on UPenn-GBM glioblastoma MRI (n=403; 2006-2018; age 18-89 years; 60% male). Models were trained with no dropout or targeted T2-FLAIR dropout (probability rate r=0.35 or 0.50) by replacing only the T2-FLAIR channel with zeros. Inference used T2-FLAIR-present and T2-FLAIR-absent scenarios (T2-FLAIR set to zero). The primary endpoint was Dice similarity coefficient (DSC); secondary endpoints were 95th percentile Hausdorff distance and Bland-Altman whole-tumor volume bias. Equivalence was assessed with two one-sided tests using +/-1.5 DSC percentage points, and noninferiority versus HD-GLIO used a -1.5-point margin. Results: With T2-FLAIR present, median overall DSC was 94.8% (interquartile range, 90.0%-97.1%) with dropout and 95.0% (interquartile range, 90.3%-97.1%) without dropout (equivalence supported, p<0.001). With T2-FLAIR absent, median overall DSC improved from 81.0% (interquartile range, 75.1%-86.4%) without dropout to 93.4% (interquartile range, 89.1%-96.2%) with dropout (r=0.35); edema DSC improved from 14.0% to 87.0%, edema 95th percentile Hausdorff distance improved from 22.44 mm to 2.45 mm, and whole-tumor volume bias improved from -45.6 mL to 0.83 mL. Dropout was noninferior to HD-GLIO under T2-FLAIR-present (all p<0.001). Conclusion: Targeted T2-FLAIR dropout preserved segmentation performance when T2-FLAIR was available and reduced segmentation error and whole-tumor volume bias when T2-FLAIR was absent.

Abstract: Accurate per-branch 3D reconstruction is a prerequisite for autonomous UAV-based tree pruning; however, dense disparity maps from modern stereo matchers often remain too noisy for individual branch analysis in complex forest canopies. This paper introduces a progressive pipeline integrating DEFOM-Stereo foundation-model disparity estimation, SAM3 instance segmentation, and multi-stage depth optimization to deliver robust per-branch point clouds. Starting from a naive baseline, we systematically identify and resolve three error families through successive refinements. Mask boundary contamination is first addressed through morphological erosion and subsequently refined via a skeleton-preserving variant to safeguard thin-branch topology. Segmentation inaccuracy is then mitigated using LAB-space Mahalanobis color validation coupled with cross-branch overlap arbitration. Finally, depth noise - the most persistent error source - is initially reduced by outlier removal and median filtering, before being superseded by a robust five-stage scheme comprising MAD global detection, spatial density consensus, local MAD filtering, RGB-guided filtering, and adaptive bilateral filtering. Evaluated on 1920x1080 stereo imagery of Radiata pine (Pinus radiata) acquired with a ZED Mini camera (63 mm baseline) from a UAV in Canterbury, New Zealand, the proposed pipeline reduces the average per-branch depth standard deviation by 82% while retaining edge fidelity. The result is geometrically coherent 3D point clouds suitable for autonomous pruning tool positioning. All code and processed data are publicly released to facilitate further UAV forestry research.

TL;DR: MS-RSuper 是一种新的神经影像报告监督学习方法，针对多参数脑肿瘤 MRI 中的细粒度模态报告、不完整标注和定性描述，提出了模态特定、单侧约束的损失框架，显著提升了脑肿瘤检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统报告监督学习在面对多参数脑肿瘤 MRI 时存在局限性：1）细粒度的模态特定报告与肿瘤子结构相关；2）报告通常只描述最大病灶且包含不确定的定性线索；3）现有的全局约束方法容易产生假阳性或忽略层次化信息；4）需要利用不同病灶类型的解剖先验知识。

Method: MS-RSuper 框架：1）解析全局定量和模态特定定性描述；2）使用存在性与缺失损失将模态特定线索与对应子结构对齐；3）对部分定量线索施加单侧约束；4）添加轴外/轴内解剖先验以适应不同病灶类型；5）通过置信度标记调整惩罚权重，缺失线索予以降权。

Result: 在包含 1238 份报告标注的 BraTS-MET/MEN 数据集上，MS-RSuper 显著优于稀疏监督基线方法以及传统的报告监督学习方法。

Conclusion: MS-RSuper 能够有效处理脑肿瘤 MRI 中复杂的层级化描述和不确定线索，通过模态特定、单侧约束和不确定性感知的损失设计，提升了报告监督学习在临床多模态影像环境下的实用性。

Abstract: Report-supervised (RSuper) learning seeks to alleviate the need for dense tumor voxel labels with constraints derived from radiology reports (e.g., volumes, counts, sizes, locations). In MRI studies of brain tumors, however, we often involve multi-parametric scans and substructures. Here, fine-grained modality/parameter-wise reports are usually provided along with global findings and are correlated with different substructures. Moreover, the reports often describe only the largest lesion and provide qualitative or uncertain cues (``mild,'' ``possible''). Classical RSuper losses (e.g., sum volume consistency) can over-constrain or hallucinate unreported findings under such incompleteness, and are unable to utilize these hierarchical findings or exploit the priors of varied lesion types in a merged dataset. We explicitly parse the global quantitative and modality-wise qualitative findings and introduce a unified, one-sided, uncertainty-aware formulation (MS-RSuper) that: (i) aligns modality-specific qualitative cues (e.g., T1c enhancement, FLAIR edema) with their corresponding substructures using existence and absence losses; (ii) enforces one-sided lower-bounds for partial quantitative cues (e.g., largest lesion size, minimal multiplicity); and (iii) adds extra- vs. intra-axial anatomical priors to respect cohort differences. Certainty tokens scale penalties; missing cues are down-weighted. On 1238 report-labeled BraTS-MET/MEN scans, our MS-RSuper largely outperforms both a sparsely-supervised baseline and a naive RSuper method.

Abstract: Radar-based human activity recognition has gained attention as a privacy-preserving alternative to vision and wearable sensors, especially in sensitive environments like long-term care facilities. Micro-Doppler spectrograms derived from FMCW radar signals are central to recognizing dynamic activities, but their effectiveness is limited by noise and clutter. In this work, we use a benchmark radar dataset to reimplement and assess three recent denoising and preprocessing techniques: adaptive preprocessing, adaptive thresholding, and entropy-based denoising. To illustrate the shortcomings of conventional metrics in low-SNR regimes, we evaluate performance using both perceptual image quality measures and standard error-based metrics. We additionally propose a novel framework for static activity recognition using range-angle feature maps to expand HAR beyond dynamic activities. We present two important contributions: a temporal tracking algorithm to enforce consistency and a no-reference quality scoring algorithm to assess RA-map fidelity. According to experimental findings, our suggested techniques enhance classification performance and interpretability for both dynamic and static activities, opening the door for more reliable radar-based HAR systems.

Abstract: The correlated color temperature (CCT) and color rendering index (CRI) of artificial light sources are important because they have implications for human biology and professional applications. Although CCT information is generally available for commercial lamps, CRI is commonly not reported. In addition, devices measuring these parameters are difficult to access as they require a spectrophotometer, a commonly expensive device. In this context, the present work designs and builds a meter in detail, from the structural part of the equipment, interface with sensors, and the calculation to the compensation algorithms implementation, aiming to build the dedicated functionalities of a spectrophotometer, which is designed without the use of optical lenses. In addition to simplifying the device, this approach allows measurements free from dispersions caused by chromatic aberrations typical of optical lenses. The prototype obtained proved to be effective, capturing the spectral power distributions of various light sources and calculating their CCT and CRI.

Abstract: We present an application of the tensor network generator-enhanced optimization (TN-GEO) framework to address the traveling salesman problem (TSP), a fundamental combinatorial optimization challenge. Our approach employs a tensor network Born machine based on automatically differentiable matrix product states (MPS) as the generative model, using the Born rule to define probability distributions over candidate solutions. Unlike approaches based on binary encoding, which require $N^2$ variables and penalty terms to enforce valid tour constraints, we adopt a permutation-based formulation with integer variables and use autoregressive sampling with masking to guarantee that every generated sample is a valid tour by construction. We also introduce a $k$-site MPS variant that learns distributions over $k$-grams (consecutive city subsequences) using a sliding window approach, enabling parameter-efficient modeling for larger instances. Experimental validation on TSPLIB benchmark instances with up to 52 cities demonstrates that TN-GEO can outperform classical heuristics including swap and 2-opt hill-climbing. The $k$-site variants, which put more focus on local correlations, show better results compared to the full-MPS case.

Abstract: Changing runtime complexity on cloud and edge devices necessitates elastic large language model (LLM) deployment, where an LLM can be inferred with various quantization precisions based on available computational resources. However, it has been observed that the calibration parameters for quantization are typically linked to specific precisions, which presents challenges during elastic-precision calibration and precision switching at runtime. In this work, we attribute the source of varying calibration parameters to the varying token-level sensitivity caused by a precision-dependent outlier migration phenomenon.Motivated by this observation, we propose \texttt{MoBiQuant}, a novel Mixture-of-Bits quantization framework that adjusts weight precision for elastic LLM inference based on token sensitivity. Specifically, we propose the many-in-one recursive residual quantization that can iteratively reconstruct higher-precision weights and the token-aware router to dynamically select the number of residual bit slices. MoBiQuant enables smooth precision switching while improving generalization for the distribution of token outliers. Experimental results demonstrate that MoBiQuant exhibits strong elasticity, enabling it to match the performance of bit-specific calibrated PTQ on LLaMA3-8B without repeated calibration.

Conclusion: 联邦更新机制提供了自然的参与激励：用户在共享技术标准平台注册本地检查数据集后，可定期获得更新的全球基准参数，实现了基于证据的生命周期规划，同时保护了数据主权。

Abstract: Bridge periodic inspection records contain sensitive information about public infrastructure, making cross-organizational data sharing impractical under existing data governance constraints. We propose a federated framework for estimating a Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) hazard model of bridge deterioration, enabling municipalities to collaboratively train a shared benchmark model without transferring raw inspection records. Each User holds local inspection data and trains a log-linear hazard model over three deterioration-direction transitions -- Good$\to$Minor, Good$\to$Severe, and Minor$\to$Severe -- with covariates for bridge age, coastline distance, and deck area. Local optimization is performed via mini-batch stochastic gradient descent on the CTMC log-likelihood, and only a 12-dimensional pseudo-gradient vector is uploaded to a central server per communication round. The server aggregates User updates using sample-weighted Federated Averaging (FedAvg) with momentum and gradient clipping. All experiments in this paper are conducted on fully synthetic data generated from a known ground-truth parameter set with region-specific heterogeneity, enabling controlled evaluation of federated convergence behaviour. Simulation results across heterogeneous Users show consistent convergence of the average negative log-likelihood, with the aggregated gradient norm decreasing as User scale increases. Furthermore, the federated update mechanism provides a natural participation incentive: Users who register their local inspection datasets on a shared technical-standard platform receive in return the periodically updated global benchmark parameters -- information that cannot be obtained from local data alone -- thereby enabling evidence-based life-cycle planning without surrendering data sovereignty.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在强化学习训练过程中，由于其巨大的状态空间和稀疏奖励，常出现熵崩塌、策略退化或对次优行为的过度利用等问题。现有方法在探索效率方面存在不足，需要一种既能保持生产性随机性又避免无节制随机采样低效问题的探索策略。

Result: 在八个基准测试中进行了广泛实验，包括领域内和跨领域设置，都显示了一致的改进，验证了可控混合策略RLVR训练的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过控制探索的混合策略强化学习框架缓解了模型策略与专家轨迹之间的分布失配，实现了更稳定的探索-利用平衡，为解决MLLM强化学习训练中的关键挑战提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a primary learning paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). However, during RL training, the enormous state space of MLLM and sparse rewards often leads to entropy collapse, policy degradation, or over-exploitation of suboptimal behaviors. This necessitates an exploration strategy that maintains productive stochasticity while avoiding the drawbacks of uncontrolled random sampling, yielding inefficient exploration. In this paper, we propose CalibRL, a hybrid-policy RLVR framework that supports controllable exploration with expert guidance, enabled by two key mechanisms. First, a distribution-aware advantage weighting scales updates by group rareness to calibrate the distribution, therefore preserving exploration. Meanwhile, the asymmetric activation function (LeakyReLU) leverages the expert knowledge as a calibration baseline to moderate overconfident updates while preserving their corrective direction. CalibRL increases policy entropy in a guided manner and clarifies the target distribution by estimating the on-policy distribution through online sampling. Updates are driven by these informative behaviors, avoiding convergence to erroneous patterns. Importantly, these designs help alleviate the distributional mismatch between the model's policy and expert trajectories, thereby achieving a more stable balance between exploration and exploitation. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks, including both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, demonstrate consistent improvements, validating the effectiveness of our controllable hybrid-policy RLVR training.

Abstract: Class imbalance, overlap, and noise degrade data quality, reduce model reliability, and limit generalization. Although widely studied in binary classification, these issues remain underexplored in multi-class settings, where complex inter-class relationships make minority-majority structures unclear and traditional clustering fails to capture distribution shape. Approaches that rely only on geometric distances risk removing informative samples and generating low-quality synthetic data, while binarization approaches treat imbalance locally and ignore global inter-class dependencies. At the algorithmic level, ensembles struggle to integrate weak classifiers, leading to limited robustness. This paper proposes IMOVNO+ (IMbalance-OVerlap-NOise+ Algorithm-Level Optimization), a two-level framework designed to jointly enhance data quality and algorithmic robustness for binary and multi-class tasks. At the data level, first, conditional probability is used to quantify the informativeness of each sample. Second, the dataset is partitioned into core, overlapping, and noisy regions. Third, an overlapping-cleaning algorithm is introduced that combines Z-score metrics with a big-jump gap distance. Fourth, a smart oversampling algorithm based on multi-regularization controls synthetic sample proximity, preventing new overlaps. At the algorithmic level, a meta-heuristic prunes ensemble classifiers to reduce weak-learner influence. IMOVNO+ was evaluated on 35 datasets (13 multi-class, 22 binary). Results show consistent superiority over state-of-the-art methods, approaching 100% in several cases. For multi-class data, IMOVNO+ achieves gains of 37-57% in G-mean, 25-44% in F1-score, 25-39% in precision, and 26-43% in recall. In binary tasks, it attains near-perfect performance with improvements of 14-39%. The framework handles data scarcity and imbalance from collection and privacy limits.

Abstract: Crystal modeling spans a family of conditional and unconditional generation tasks across different modalities, including crystal structure prediction (CSP) and \emph{de novo} generation (DNG). While recent deep generative models have shown promising performance, they remain largely task-specific, lacking a unified framework that shares crystal representations across different generation tasks. To address this limitation, we propose \emph{Multimodal Crystal Flow (MCFlow)}, a unified multimodal flow model that realizes multiple crystal generation tasks as distinct inference trajectories via independent time variables for atom types and crystal structures. To enable multimodal flow in a standard transformer model, we introduce a composition- and symmetry-aware atom ordering with hierarchical permutation augmentation, injecting strong compositional and crystallographic priors without explicit structural templates. Experiments on the MP-20 and MPTS-52 benchmarks show that MCFlow achieves competitive performance against task-specific baselines across multiple crystal generation tasks.

Abstract: Self-speculative decoding (SSD) accelerates LLM inference by skipping layers to create an efficient draft model, yet existing methods often rely on static heuristics that ignore the dynamic computational overhead of attention in long-context scenarios. We propose KnapSpec, a training-free framework that reformulates draft model selection as a knapsack problem to maximize tokens-per-time throughput. By decoupling Attention and MLP layers and modeling their hardware-specific latencies as functions of context length, KnapSpec adaptively identifies optimal draft configurations on the fly via a parallel dynamic programming algorithm. Furthermore, we provide the first rigorous theoretical analysis establishing cosine similarity between hidden states as a mathematically sound proxy for the token acceptance rate. This foundation allows our method to maintain high drafting faithfulness while navigating the shifting bottlenecks of real-world hardware. Our experiments on Qwen3 and Llama3 demonstrate that KnapSpec consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SSD baselines, achieving up to 1.47x wall-clock speedup across various benchmarks. Our plug-and-play approach ensures high-speed inference for long sequences without requiring additional training or compromising the target model's output distribution.

Abstract: Recently, TabPFN has gained attention as a foundation model for tabular data. However, it struggles to integrate heterogeneous modalities such as images and text, which are common in domains like healthcare and marketing, thereby limiting its applicability. To address this, we present the Multi-Modal Prior-data Fitted Network (MMPFN), which extends TabPFN to handle tabular and non-tabular modalities in a unified manner. MMPFN comprises per-modality encoders, modality projectors, and pre-trained foundation models. The modality projectors serve as the critical bridge, transforming non-tabular embeddings into tabular-compatible tokens for unified processing. To this end, we introduce a multi-head gated MLP and a cross-attention pooler that extract richer context from non-tabular inputs while mitigates attention imbalance issue in multimodal learning. Extensive experiments on medical and general-purpose multimodal datasets demonstrate that MMPFN consistently outperforms competitive state-of-the-art methods and effectively exploits non-tabular modalities alongside tabular features. These results highlight the promise of extending prior-data fitted networks to the multimodal setting, offering a scalable and effective framework for heterogeneous data learning.

Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is the most widely used method for calculating molecular properties; however, its accuracy is often insufficient for quantitative predictions. Coupled-cluster (CC) theory is the most successful method for achieving accuracy beyond DFT and for predicting properties that closely align with experiment. It is known as the ''gold standard'' of quantum chemistry. Unfortunately, the high computational cost of CC limits its widespread applicability. In this work, we present the Molecular Orbital Learning (MōLe) architecture, an equivariant machine learning model that directly predicts CC's core mathematical objects, the excitation amplitudes, from the mean-field Hartree-Fock molecular orbitals as inputs. We test various aspects of our model and demonstrate its remarkable data efficiency and out-of-distribution generalization to larger molecules and off-equilibrium geometries, despite being trained only on small equilibrium geometries. Finally, we also examine its ability to reduce the number of cycles required to converge CC calculations. MōLe can set the foundations for high-accuracy wavefunction-based ML architectures to accelerate molecular design and complement force-field approaches.

Motivation: 现代供应链日益复杂，涉及多式联运、跨国配送和显著的地区差异，导致物流配送延迟预测极其困难。特别是延迟发货数据稀少但影响运营（不平衡数据），急需一个准确的预测模型来保障运营效率和客户满意度。

Abstract: Accurate delivery delay prediction is critical for maintaining operational efficiency and customer satisfaction across modern supply chains. Yet the increasing complexity of logistics networks, spanning multimodal transportation, cross-country routing, and pronounced regional variability, makes this prediction task inherently challenging. This paper introduces a multi-task deep learning model for delivery delay duration prediction in the presence of significant imbalanced data, where delayed shipments are rare but operationally consequential. The model embeds high-dimensional shipment features with dedicated embedding layers for tabular data, and then uses a classification-then-regression strategy to predict the delivery delay duration for on-time and delayed shipments. Unlike sequential pipelines, this approach enables end-to-end training, improves the detection of delayed cases, and supports probabilistic forecasting for uncertainty-aware decision making. The proposed approach is evaluated on a large-scale real-world dataset from an industrial partner, comprising more than 10 million historical shipment records across four major source locations with distinct regional characteristics. The proposed model is compared with traditional machine learning methods. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a mean absolute error of 0.67-0.91 days for delayed-shipment predictions, outperforming single-step tree-based regression baselines by 41-64% and two-step classify-then-regress tree-based models by 15-35%. These gains demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in operational delivery delay forecasting under highly imbalanced and heterogeneous conditions.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been reported to linearly encode truthfulness, yet recent work questions this finding's generality. We reconcile these views with the truthfulness spectrum hypothesis: the representational space contains directions ranging from broadly domain-general to narrowly domain-specific. To test this hypothesis, we systematically evaluate probe generalization across five truth types (definitional, empirical, logical, fictional, and ethical), sycophantic and expectation-inverted lying, and existing honesty benchmarks. Linear probes generalize well across most domains but fail on sycophantic and expectation-inverted lying. Yet training on all domains jointly recovers strong performance, confirming that domain-general directions exist despite poor pairwise transfer. The geometry of probe directions explains these patterns: Mahalanobis cosine similarity between probes near-perfectly predicts cross-domain generalization (R^2=0.98). Concept-erasure methods further isolate truth directions that are (1) domain-general, (2) domain-specific, or (3) shared only across particular domain subsets. Causal interventions reveal that domain-specific directions steer more effectively than domain-general ones. Finally, post-training reshapes truth geometry, pushing sycophantic lying further from other truth types, suggesting a representational basis for chat models' sycophantic tendencies. Together, our results support the truthfulness spectrum hypothesis: truth directions of varying generality coexist in representational space, with post-training reshaping their geometry. Code for all experiments is provided in https://github.com/zfying/truth_spec.

Abstract: We study a discrete denoising diffusion framework that integrates a sample-efficient estimator of single-site conditionals with round-robin noising and denoising dynamics for generative modeling over discrete state spaces. Rather than approximating a discrete analog of a score function, our formulation treats single-site conditional probabilities as the fundamental objects that parameterize the reverse diffusion process. We employ a sample-efficient method known as Neural Interaction Screening Estimator (NeurISE) to estimate these conditionals in the diffusion dynamics. Controlled experiments on synthetic Ising models, MNIST, and scientific data sets produced by a D-Wave quantum annealer, synthetic Potts model and one-dimensional quantum systems demonstrate the proposed approach. On the binary data sets, these experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms popular existing methods including ratio-based approaches, achieving improved performance in total variation, cross-correlations, and kernel density estimation metrics.

Abstract: Curriculum learning is a class of training strategies that organizes the data being exposed to a model by difficulty, gradually from simpler to more complex examples. This research explores a reverse curriculum generation approach that recursively decomposes complex datasets into simpler, more learnable components. We propose a teacher-student framework where the teacher is equipped with the ability to reason step-by-step, which is used to recursively generate easier versions of examples, enabling the student model to progressively master difficult tasks. We propose a novel scoring system to measure data difficulty based on its structural complexity and conceptual depth, allowing curriculum construction over decomposed data. Experiments on math datasets (MATH and AIME) and code generation datasets demonstrate that models trained with curricula generated by our approach exhibit superior performance compared to standard training on original datasets.

Abstract: High-fidelity computational models of cardiac mechanics provide mechanistic insight into the heart function but are computationally prohibitive for routine clinical use. Surrogate models can accelerate simulations, but generalization across diverse anatomies is challenging, particularly in data-scarce settings. We propose a two-step framework that decouples geometric representation from learning the physics response, to enable shape-informed surrogate modeling under data-scarce conditions. First, a shape model learns a compact latent representation of left ventricular geometries. The learned latent space effectively encodes anatomies and enables synthetic geometries generation for data augmentation. Second, a neural field-based surrogate model, conditioned on this geometric encoding, is trained to predict ventricular displacement under external loading. The proposed architecture performs positional encoding by using universal ventricular coordinates, which improves generalization across diverse anatomies. Geometric variability is encoded using two alternative strategies, which are systematically compared: a PCA-based approach suitable for working with point cloud representations of geometries, and a DeepSDF-based implicit neural representation learned directly from point clouds. Overall, our results, obtained on idealized and patient-specific datasets, show that the proposed approaches allow for accurate predictions and generalization to unseen geometries, and robustness to noisy or sparsely sampled inputs.

Abstract: Time-series foundation models (TSFMs) have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities across diverse datasets and tasks. However, existing foundation models are typically pre-trained to enhance performance on specific tasks and often struggle to generalize to unseen tasks without fine-tuning. To address this limitation, we propose augmenting TSFMs with In-Context Learning (ICL) capabilities, enabling them to perform test-time inference by dynamically adapting to input-output relationships provided within the context. Our framework, In-Context Time-series Pre-training (ICTP), restructures the original pre-training data to equip the backbone TSFM with ICL capabilities, enabling adaptation to unseen tasks. Experiments demonstrate that ICT improves the performance of state-of-the-art TSFMs by approximately 11.4% on unseen tasks without requiring fine-tuning.

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models unify perception, language, and control for embodied agents but face significant challenges in practical deployment due to rapidly increasing compute and memory demands, especially as models scale to longer horizons and larger backbones. To address these bottlenecks, we introduce QuantVLA, a training-free post-training quantization (PTQ) framework that, to our knowledge, is the first PTQ approach for VLA systems and the first to successfully quantize a diffusion transformer (DiT) action head. QuantVLA incorporates three scale-calibrated components: (1) a selective quantization layout that integerizes all linear layers in both the language backbone and the DiT while keeping attention projections in floating point to preserve the original operator schedule; (2) attention temperature matching, a lightweight per-head scaling mechanism that stabilizes attention logits and is folded into the dequantization scales at inference; and (3) output head balancing, a per-layer residual interface calibration that mitigates post-projection energy drift. The framework requires no additional training, uses only a small unlabeled calibration buffer, and supports integer kernels for low-bit weights and activations while leaving the architecture unchanged. Across representative VLA models on LIBERO, QuantVLA exceeds the task success rates of full-precision baselines, achieves about 70% relative memory savings on the quantized components, and delivers a 1.22x speedup in end-to-end inference latency, providing a practical pathway toward scalable low-bit embodied intelligence under strict compute, memory, and power constraints.

Abstract: This work presents Causal Drift Generator (CaDrift), a time-dependent synthetic data generator framework based on Structural Causal Models (SCMs). The framework produces a virtually infinite combination of data streams with controlled shift events and time-dependent data, making it a tool to evaluate methods under evolving data. CaDrift synthesizes various distributional and covariate shifts by drifting mapping functions of the SCM, which change underlying cause-and-effect relationships between features and the target. In addition, CaDrift models occasional perturbations by leveraging interventions in causal modeling. Experimental results show that, after distributional shift events, the accuracy of classifiers tends to drop, followed by a gradual retrieval, confirming the generator's effectiveness in simulating shifts. The framework has been made available on GitHub.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting significantly improves reasoning in Large Language Models, yet the temporal dynamics of the underlying representation geometry remain poorly understood. We investigate these dynamics by applying Manifold Capacity Theory (MCT) to a compositional Boolean logic task, allowing us to quantify the linear separability of latent representations without the confounding factors of probe training. Our analysis reveals that reasoning manifests as a transient geometric pulse, where concept manifolds are untangled into linearly separable subspaces immediately prior to computation and rapidly compressed thereafter. This behavior diverges from standard linear probe accuracy, which remains high long after computation, suggesting a fundamental distinction between information that is merely retrievable and information that is geometrically prepared for processing. We interpret this phenomenon as \emph{Dynamic Manifold Management}, a mechanism where the model dynamically modulates representational capacity to optimize the bandwidth of the residual stream throughout the reasoning chain.

Abstract: Graph self-supervised learning (GSSL) has demonstrated strong potential for generating expressive graph embeddings without the need for human annotations, making it particularly valuable in domains with high labeling costs such as molecular graph analysis. However, existing GSSL methods mostly focus on node- or edge-level information, often ignoring chemically relevant substructures which strongly influence molecular properties. In this work, we propose Graph Semantic Predictive Network (GraSPNet), a hierarchical self-supervised framework that explicitly models both atomic-level and fragment-level semantics. GraSPNet decomposes molecular graphs into chemically meaningful fragments without predefined vocabularies and learns node- and fragment-level representations through multi-level message passing with masked semantic prediction at both levels. This hierarchical semantic supervision enables GraSPNet to learn multi-resolution structural information that is both expressive and transferable. Extensive experiments on multiple molecular property prediction benchmarks demonstrate that GraSPNet learns chemically meaningful representations and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GSSL methods in transfer learning settings.

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have become a strong framework for high-quality generative modeling, yet pretrained models are rarely used in their vanilla conditional form: conditional samples without guidance often appear diffuse and lack fine-grained detail due to the smoothing effects of neural networks. Existing guidance techniques such as classifier-free guidance (CFG) improve fidelity but double the inference cost and typically reduce sample diversity. We introduce Momentum Guidance (MG), a new dimension of guidance that leverages the ODE trajectory itself. MG extrapolates the current velocity using an exponential moving average of past velocities and preserves the standard one-evaluation-per-step cost. It matches the effect of standard guidance without extra computation and can further improve quality when combined with CFG. Experiments demonstrate MG's effectiveness across benchmarks. Specifically, on ImageNet-256, MG achieves average improvements in FID of 36.68% without CFG and 25.52% with CFG across various sampling settings, attaining an FID of 1.597 at 64 sampling steps. Evaluations on large flow-based models like Stable Diffusion 3 and FLUX.1-dev further confirm consistent quality enhancements across standard metrics.

Abstract: The universal approximation theorem establishes that neural networks can approximate any continuous function on a compact set. Later works in approximation theory provide quantitative approximation rates for ReLU networks on the class of $α$-Hölder functions $f: [0,1]^N \to \mathbb{R}$. The goal of this paper is to provide similar quantitative approximation results in the context of group equivariant learning, where the learned $α$-Hölder function is known to obey certain group symmetries. While there has been much interest in the literature in understanding the universal approximation properties of equivariant models, very few quantitative approximation results are known for equivariant models.
  In this paper, we bridge this gap by deriving quantitative approximation rates for several prominent group-equivariant and invariant architectures. The architectures that we consider include: the permutation-invariant Deep Sets architecture; the permutation-equivariant Sumformer and Transformer architectures; joint invariance to permutations and rigid motions using invariant networks based on frame averaging; and general bi-Lipschitz invariant models. Overall, we show that equally-sized ReLU MLPs and equivariant architectures are equally expressive over equivariant functions. Thus, hard-coding equivariance does not result in a loss of expressivity or approximation power in these models.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence promises to yield insights into relevant features, thereby enabling humans to examine and scrutinize machine learning models or even facilitating scientific discovery. Considering the widespread technique of Shapley values, we find that purely data-driven operationalization of multivariate feature importance is unsuitable for such purposes. Even for simple problems with two features, spurious associations due to collider bias and suppression arise from considering one feature only in the observational context of the other, which can lead to misinterpretations. Causal knowledge about the data-generating process is required to identify and correct such misleading feature attributions. We propose cc-Shapley (causal context Shapley), an interventional modification of conventional observational Shapley values leveraging knowledge of the data's causal structure, thereby analyzing the relevance of a feature in the causal context of the remaining features. We show theoretically that this eradicates spurious association induced by collider bias. We compare the behavior of Shapley and cc-Shapley values on various, synthetic, and real-world datasets. We observe nullification or reversal of associations compared to univariate feature importance when moving from observational to cc-Shapley.

Although techniques from both paradigms have been shown to improve model accuracy on a wide variety of tasks, we argue that the datasets used for these evaluations could cause overoptimistic evaluation results. Unlike many real-world datasets, they often (1) have no features with more salience than truthfulness, (2) have balanced training sets, and (3) contain only data points to which the model can give a well-defined answer. We construct datasets that lack each of these properties to stress-test a range of standard unsupervised elicitation and easy-to-hard generalization techniques. We find that no technique reliably performs well on any of these challenges. We also study ensembling and combining easy-to-hard and unsupervised techniques, and find they only partially mitigate performance degradation due to these challenges. We believe that overcoming these challenges should be a priority for future work on unsupervised elicitation.

Abstract: We study distributionally robust online learning, where a risk-averse learner updates decisions sequentially to guard against worst-case distributions drawn from a Wasserstein ambiguity set centered at past observations. While this paradigm is well understood in the offline setting through Wasserstein Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), its online extension poses significant challenges in both convergence and computation. In this paper, we address these challenges. First, we formulate the problem as an online saddle-point stochastic game between a decision maker and an adversary selecting worst-case distributions, and propose a general framework that converges to a robust Nash equilibrium coinciding with the solution of the corresponding offline Wasserstein DRO problem. Second, we address the main computational bottleneck, which is the repeated solution of worst-case expectation problems. For the important class of piecewise concave loss functions, we propose a tailored algorithm that exploits problem geometry to achieve substantial speedups over state-of-the-art solvers such as Gurobi. The key insight is a novel connection between the worst-case expectation problem, an inherently infinite-dimensional optimization problem, and a classical and tractable budget allocation problem, which is of independent interest.

Conclusion: κ-Explorer通过参数化目标函数统一处理多种估计误差目标，在理论保证和实际性能上均优于现有探索方法，为主动探索提供了有效的框架。

Abstract: In tabular Markov decision processes (MDPs) with perfect state observability, each trajectory provides active samples from the transition distributions conditioned on state-action pairs. Consequently, accurate model estimation depends on how the exploration policy allocates visitation frequencies in accordance with the intrinsic complexity of each transition distribution. Building on recent work on coverage-based exploration, we introduce a parameterized family of decomposable and concave objective functions $U_κ$ that explicitly incorporate both intrinsic estimation complexity and extrinsic visitation frequency. Moreover, the curvature $κ$ provides a unified treatment of various global objectives, such as the average-case and worst-case estimation error objectives. Using the closed-form characterization of the gradient of $U_κ$, we propose $κ$-Explorer, an active exploration algorithm that performs Frank-Wolfe-style optimization over state-action occupancy measures. The diminishing-returns structure of $U_κ$ naturally prioritizes underexplored and high-variance transitions, while preserving smoothness properties that enable efficient optimization. We establish tight regret guarantees for $κ$-Explorer and further introduce a fully online and computationally efficient surrogate algorithm for practical use. Experiments on benchmark MDPs demonstrate that $κ$-Explorer provides superior performance compared to existing exploration strategies.

Abstract: Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) has emerged as a widely adopted paradigm for providing access to deep neural network (DNN) models, enabling users to conveniently leverage these models through standardized APIs. However, such services are highly vulnerable to Model Extraction Attacks (MEAs), where an adversary repeatedly queries a target model to collect input-output pairs and uses them to train a surrogate model that closely replicates its functionality. While numerous defense strategies have been proposed, verifying the ownership of a suspicious model with strict theoretical guarantees remains a challenging task. To address this gap, we introduce CREDIT, a certified ownership verification against MEAs. Specifically, we employ mutual information to quantify the similarity between DNN models, propose a practical verification threshold, and provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for ownership verification based on this threshold. We extensively evaluate our approach on several mainstream datasets across different domains and tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our implementation is publicly available at: https://github.com/LabRAI/CREDIT.

Abstract: Efficient operator scheduling is a fundamental challenge in software compilation and hardware synthesis. While recent differentiable approaches have sought to replace traditional ones like exact solvers or heuristics with gradient-based search, they typically rely on categorical distributions that fail to capture the ordinal nature of time and suffer from a parameter space that scales poorly. In this paper, we propose a novel differentiable framework, GauS, that models operator scheduling as a stochastic relaxation using Gaussian distributions, which fully utilize modern parallel computing devices like GPUs. By representing schedules as continuous Gaussian variables, we successfully capture the ordinal nature of time and reduce the optimization space by orders of magnitude. Our method is highly flexible to represent various objectives and constraints, which provides the first differentiable formulation for the complex pipelined scheduling problem. We evaluate our method on a range of benchmarks, demonstrating that Gaus achieves Pareto-optimal results.

Abstract: Machine learning holds great promise for advancing the field of medicine, with electronic health records (EHRs) serving as a primary data source. However, EHRs are often sparse and contain missing data due to various challenges and limitations in data collection and sharing between healthcare providers. Existing techniques for imputing missing values predominantly focus on known unknowns, such as missing or unavailable values of lab test results; most do not explicitly address situations where it is difficult to distinguish what is missing. For instance, a missing diagnosis code in an EHR could signify either that the patient has not been diagnosed with the condition or that a diagnosis was made, but not shared by a provider. Such situations fall into the paradigm of unknown unknowns. To address this challenge, we develop a general purpose algorithm for denoising data to recover unknown missing values in binary EHRs. We design a transformer-based denoising neural network where the output is thresholded adaptively to recover values in cases where we predict data are missing. Our results demonstrate improved accuracy in denoising medical codes within a real EHR dataset compared to existing imputation approaches and leads to increased performance on downstream tasks using the denoised data. In particular, when applying our method to a real world application, predicting hospital readmission from EHRs, our method achieves statistically significant improvement over all existing baselines.

Abstract: Modern Protein Language Models (PLMs) apply transformer-based model architectures from natural language processing to biological sequences, predicting a variety of protein functions and properties. However, protein language has key differences from natural language, such as a rich functional space despite a vocabulary of only 20 amino acids. These differences motivate research into how transformer-based architectures operate differently in the protein domain and how we can better leverage PLMs to solve protein-related tasks. In this work, we begin by directly comparing how the distribution of information stored across layers of attention heads differs between the protein and natural language domain. Furthermore, we adapt a simple early-exit technique-originally used in the natural language domain to improve efficiency at the cost of performance-to achieve both increased accuracy and substantial efficiency gains in protein non-structural property prediction by allowing the model to automatically select protein representations from the intermediate layers of the PLMs for the specific task and protein at hand. We achieve performance gains ranging from 0.4 to 7.01 percentage points while simultaneously improving efficiency by over 10 percent across models and non-structural prediction tasks. Our work opens up an area of research directly comparing how language models change behavior when moved into the protein domain and advances language modeling in biological domains.

Abstract: We study online alignment of large language models under misspecified preference feedback, where the observed preference oracle deviates from an ideal but unknown ground-truth oracle. The online LLM alignment problem is a bi-level reinforcement problem due to the coupling between data collection and policy updates. Recently, the problem has been reduced to tractable single-level objective in the SAIL (Self-Improving Efficient Online Alignment) framework. In this paper, we introduce a pointwise oracle uncertainty set in this problem and formulate an oracle-robust online alignment objective as a worst-case optimization problem. For log-linear policies, we show that this robust objective admits an exact closed-form decomposition into the original loss function plus an explicit sensitivity penalty. We develop projected stochastic composite updates for the resulting weakly convex objective and prove $\widetilde{O}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ oracle complexity for reaching approximate stationarity.

Abstract: Attention learners, neural networks built on the attention mechanism, e.g., transformers, excel at learning the implicit relationships that relate sequences to their corresponding properties, e.g., mapping a given sequence of tokens to the probability of the next token. However, the learning process tends to be costly. To address this, we present a novel paradigm named Attention Neural Teaching (AtteNT) that reinterprets the learning process through a nonparametric teaching perspective. Specifically, the latter provides a theoretical framework for teaching mappings that are implicitly defined (i.e., nonparametric) via example selection. Such an implicit mapping is embodied through a dense set of sequence-property pairs, with the AtteNT teacher selecting a subset to accelerate convergence in attention learner training. By analytically investigating the role of attention on parameter-based gradient descent during training, and recasting the evolution of attention learners, shaped by parameter updates, through functional gradient descent in nonparametric teaching, we show for the first time that teaching attention learners is consistent with teaching importance-adaptive nonparametric learners. These new findings readily commit AtteNT to enhancing learning efficiency of attention learners. Specifically, we observe training time reductions of 13.01% for LLMs and 20.58% for ViTs, spanning both fine-tuning and training-from-scratch regimes. Crucially, these gains are achieved without compromising accuracy; in fact, performance is consistently preserved and often enhanced across a diverse set of downstream tasks.

Abstract: This paper provides a reinterpretation of the Drifting Model~\cite{deng2026generative} through a semigroup-consistent long-short flow-map factorization. We show that a global transport process can be decomposed into a long-horizon flow map followed by a short-time terminal flow map admitting a closed-form optimal velocity representation, and that taking the terminal interval length to zero recovers exactly the drifting field together with a conservative impulse term required for flow-map consistency. Based on this perspective, we propose a new likelihood learning formulation that aligns the long-short flow-map decomposition with density evolution under transport. We validate the framework through both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on benchmark tests, and further provide a theoretical interpretation of the feature-space optimization while highlighting several open problems for future study.

Abstract: The distinctive architectural features of normalizing flows (NFs), notably bijectivity and tractable Jacobians, make them well-suited for generative modeling. Invertible neural networks (INNs) build on these principles to address supervised inverse problems, enabling direct modeling of both forward and inverse mappings. In this paper, we revisit these architectures from both theoretical and practical perspectives and address a key gap in the literature: the lack of theoretical guarantees on approximation quality under realistic assumptions, whether for posterior inference in INNs or for generative modeling with NFs.
  We introduce a unified framework for INNs and NFs based on variational unsupervised loss functions, inspired by analogous formulations in related areas such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and the Precision-Recall divergence for training normalizing flows. Within this framework, we derive theoretical performance guarantees, quantifying posterior accuracy for INNs and distributional accuracy for NFs, under assumptions that are weaker and more practically realistic than those used in prior work.
  Building on these theoretical results, we conduct extensive case studies to distill general design principles and practical guidelines. We conclude by demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach on a realistic ocean-acoustic inversion problem.

Abstract: Decentralized federated learning (DFL) based on low-rank adaptation (LoRA) enables mobile devices with multi-task datasets to collaboratively fine-tune a large language model (LLM) by exchanging locally updated parameters with a subset of neighboring devices via wireless connections for knowledge integration.However, directly aggregating parameters fine-tuned on heterogeneous datasets induces three primary issues across the DFL life-cycle: (i) \textit{catastrophic knowledge forgetting during fine-tuning process}, arising from conflicting update directions caused by data heterogeneity; (ii) \textit{inefficient communication and convergence during model aggregation process}, due to bandwidth-intensive redundant model transmissions; and (iii) \textit{multi-task knowledge interference during inference process}, resulting from incompatible knowledge representations coexistence during inference. To address these issues in a fully decentralized scenario, we first propose a sparse-and-orthogonal LoRA that ensures orthogonality between model updates to eliminate direction conflicts during fine-tuning.Then, we analyze how device connection topology affects multi-task performance, prompting a cluster-based topology design during aggregation.Finally, we propose an implicit mixture of experts (MoE) mechanism to avoid the coexistence of incompatible knowledge during inference. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively reduces communication resource consumption by up to $73\%$ and enhances average performance by $5\%$ compared with the traditional LoRA method.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) have advanced rapidly in recent years and have been successfully applied to e-learning environments like intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs). Despite great success, the broader application of DRL to educational technologies has been limited due to major challenges such as sample inefficiency and difficulty designing the reward function. In contrast, Apprenticeship Learning (AL) uses a few expert demonstrations to infer the expert's underlying reward functions and derive decision-making policies that generalize and replicate optimal behavior. In this work, we leverage a generalized AL framework, THEMES, to induce effective pedagogical policies by capturing the complexities of the expert student learning process, where multiple reward functions may dynamically evolve over time. We evaluate the effectiveness of THEMES against six state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating its superior performance and highlighting its potential as a powerful alternative for inducing effective pedagogical policies and show that it can achieve high performance, with an AUC of 0.899 and a Jaccard of 0.653, using only 18 trajectories of a previous semester to predict student pedagogical decisions in a later semester.

Abstract: Emotion recognition from multi-modal physiological and behavioral signals plays a pivotal role in affective computing, yet most existing models remain constrained to the prediction of singular emotions in controlled laboratory settings. Real-world human emotional experiences, by contrast, are often characterized by the simultaneous presence of multiple affective states, spurring recent interest in mixed emotion recognition as an emotion distribution learning problem. Current approaches, however, often neglect the valence consistency and structured correlations inherent among coexisting emotions. To address this limitation, we propose a Memory-guided Prototypical Co-occurrence Learning (MPCL) framework that explicitly models emotion co-occurrence patterns. Specifically, we first fuse multi-modal signals via a multi-scale associative memory mechanism. To capture cross-modal semantic relationships, we construct emotion-specific prototype memory banks, yielding rich physiological and behavioral representations, and employ prototype relation distillation to ensure cross-modal alignment in the latent prototype space. Furthermore, inspired by human cognitive memory systems, we introduce a memory retrieval strategy to extract semantic-level co-occurrence associations across emotion categories. Through this bottom-up hierarchical abstraction process, our model learns affectively informative representations for accurate emotion distribution prediction. Comprehensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that MPCL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in mixed emotion recognition, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Abstract: Post-training large foundation models with reinforcement learning typically relies on massive and heterogeneous datasets, making effective curriculum learning both critical and challenging. In this work, we propose ACTOR-CURATOR, a scalable and fully automated curriculum learning framework for reinforcement learning post-training of large language models (LLMs). ACTOR-CURATOR learns a neural curator that dynamically selects training problems from large problem banks by directly optimizing for expected policy performance improvement. We formulate problem selection as a non-stationary stochastic bandit problem, derive a principled loss function based on online stochastic mirror descent, and establish regret guarantees under partial feedback. Empirically, ACTOR-CURATOR consistently outperforms uniform sampling and strong curriculum baselines across a wide range of challenging reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating improved training stability and efficiency. Notably, it achieves relative gains of 28.6% on AIME2024 and 30.5% on ARC-1D over the strongest baseline and up to 80% speedup. These results suggest that ACTOR-CURATOR is a powerful and practical approach for scalable LLM post-training.

Abstract: The choice of prior is central to solving ill-posed imaging inverse problems, making it essential to select one consistent with the measurements $y$ to avoid severe bias. In Bayesian inverse problems, this could be achieved by evaluating the model evidence $p(y \mid M)$ under different models $M$ that specify the prior and then selecting the one with the highest value. Diffusion models are the state-of-the-art approach to solving inverse problems with a data-driven prior; however, directly computing the model evidence with respect to a diffusion prior is intractable. Furthermore, most existing model evidence estimators require either many pointwise evaluations of the unnormalized prior density or an accurate clean prior score. We propose \method, an estimator of the model evidence of a diffusion prior by integrating over the time-marginals of posterior sampling methods. Our method leverages the large amount of intermediate samples naturally obtained during the reverse diffusion sampling process to obtain an accurate estimation of the model evidence using only a handful of posterior samples (e.g., 20). We also demonstrate how to implement our estimator in tandem with recent diffusion posterior sampling methods. Empirically, our estimator matches the model evidence when it can be computed analytically, and it is able to both select the correct diffusion model prior and diagnose prior misfit under different highly ill-conditioned, non-linear inverse problems, including a real-world black hole imaging problem.

Abstract: Symbolic Regression (SR) tries to reveal the hidden equations behind observed data. However, most methods search within a discrete equation space, where the structural modifications of equations rarely align with their numerical behavior, leaving fitting error feedback too noisy to guide exploration. To address this challenge, we propose GenSR, a generative latent space-based SR framework following the `map construction -> coarse localization -> fine search'' paradigm. Specifically, GenSR first pretrains a dual-branch Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) to reparameterize symbolic equations into a generative latent space with symbolic continuity and local numerical smoothness. This space can be regarded as a well-structured `map'' of the equation space, providing directional signals for search. At inference, the CVAE coarsely localizes the input data to promising regions in the latent space. Then, a modified CMA-ES refines the candidate region, leveraging smooth latent gradients. From a Bayesian perspective, GenSR reframes the SR task as maximizing the conditional distribution $p(\mathrm{Equ.} \mid \mathrm{Num.})$, with CVAE training achieving this objective through the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO). This new perspective provides a theoretical guarantee for the effectiveness of GenSR. Extensive experiments show that GenSR jointly optimizes predictive accuracy, expression simplicity, and computational efficiency, while remaining robust under noise.

Abstract: Push-Sum-based decentralized learning enables optimization over directed communication networks, where information exchange may be asymmetric. While convergence properties of such methods are well understood, their finite-iteration stability and generalization behavior remain unclear due to structural bias induced by column-stochastic mixing and asymmetric error propagation. In this work, we develop a unified uniform-stability framework for the Stochastic Gradient Push (SGP) algorithm that captures the effect of directed topology. A key technical ingredient is an imbalance-aware consistency bound for Push-Sum, which controls consensus deviation through two quantities: the stationary distribution imbalance parameter $δ$ and the spectral gap $(1-λ)$ governing mixing speed. This decomposition enables us to disentangle statistical effects from topology-induced bias. We establish finite-iteration stability and optimization guarantees for both convex objectives and non-convex objectives satisfying the Polyak--Łojasiewicz condition. For convex problems, SGP attains excess generalization error of order $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\!\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{mn}}+\fracγ{δ(1-λ)}+γ\right)$ under step-size schedules, and we characterize the corresponding optimal early stopping time that minimizes this bound. For PŁ objectives, we obtain convex-like optimization and generalization rates with dominant dependence proportional to $κ\!\left(1+\frac{1}{δ(1-λ)}\right)$, revealing a multiplicative coupling between problem conditioning and directed communication topology. Our analysis clarifies when Push-Sum correction is necessary compared with standard decentralized SGD and quantifies how imbalance and mixing jointly shape the best attainable learning performance.

Abstract: We study self-distillation in settings where supervision is unreliable: there are no ground truth labels, verifiable rewards, or external graders to evaluate answers. We focus on document-grounded question answering with asymmetric context, where a single model serves as both tutor (with access to a relevant source document during training) and student (answering from the question alone at test time). Rather than assuming tutor correctness, we derive supervision online from tutor consensus by sampling multiple document-grounded reasoning traces and using agreement to gate learning. Conditioned on this reliability signal, we distill knowledge through full tutor reasoning trajectories (not just final answers), providing a dense and stable learning signal. Empirically, this consensus-gated trajectory distillation substantially improves transfer to the document-free student. Held-out in-domain accuracy under asymmetric evaluation improves from 46.0\% to 62.0\%, and average (maj@8) accuracy on public document-free math benchmarks improves from 20.2\% to 35.4\%.

Abstract: We study online maximization of non-monotone Diminishing-Return(DR)-submodular functions over down-closed convex sets, a regime where existing projection-free online methods suffer from suboptimal regret and limited feedback guarantees. Our main contribution is a new structural result showing that this class is $1/e$-linearizable under carefully designed exponential reparametrization, scaling parameter, and surrogate potential, enabling a reduction to online linear optimization. As a result, we obtain $O(T^{1/2})$ static regret with a single gradient query per round and unlock adaptive and dynamic regret guarantees, together with improved rates under semi-bandit, bandit, and zeroth-order feedback. Across all feedback models, our bounds strictly improve the state of the art.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种无需触发器的特征级后门攻击方法VFL-TBA，在垂直联邦学习的诚实但好奇安全假设下，通过标签推断、毒化生成和后门执行三模块实现高效攻击


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 垂直联邦学习面临后门攻击威胁，但现有攻击依赖植入触发器且在训练阶段需恶意行为。研究发现触发器并非必要，且攻击者可仅在推理阶段实施攻击，这揭示现有安全假设的不足

Method: 1) 标签推断模块定位目标后门攻击标签；2) 毒化生成模块通过特征放大和扰动机制生成毒化样本；3) 后门执行模块在推理阶段实现攻击。攻击者在训练阶段保持诚实，仅在推理阶段注入毒化特征

Result: 在5个基准数据集上，该攻击效果比基线后门攻击高2-50倍，对主任务影响极小。在32个被动方且仅有1组辅助数据的VFL场景下仍保持高性能，对现有防御策略展现强鲁棒性

Conclusion: 本文揭示的无需触发器后门攻击路径表明，当前垂直联邦学习安全假设存在缺陷，需重新评估VFL安全威胁并开发更鲁棒的防御策略

Abstract: As a distributed collaborative machine learning paradigm, vertical federated learning (VFL) allows multiple passive parties with distinct features and one active party with labels to collaboratively train a model. Although it is known for the privacy-preserving capabilities, VFL still faces significant privacy and security threats from backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks typically involve an attacker implanting a trigger into the model during the training phase and executing the attack by adding the trigger to the samples during the inference phase. However, in this paper, we find that triggers are not essential for backdoor attacks in VFL. In light of this, we disclose a new backdoor attack pathway in VFL by introducing a feature-based triggerless backdoor attack. This attack operates under a more stringent security assumption, where the attacker is honest-but-curious rather than malicious during the training phase. It comprises three modules: label inference for the targeted backdoor attack, poison generation with amplification and perturbation mechanisms, and backdoor execution to implement the attack. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that our attack outperforms three baseline backdoor attacks by 2 to 50 times while minimally impacting the main task. Even in VFL scenarios with 32 passive parties and only one set of auxiliary data, our attack maintains high performance. Moreover, when confronted with distinct defense strategies, our attack remains largely unaffected and exhibits strong robustness. We hope that the disclosure of this triggerless backdoor attack pathway will encourage the community to revisit security threats in VFL scenarios and inspire researchers to develop more robust and practical defense strategies.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) saturate elementary benchmarks, the research frontier has shifted from generation to the reliability of automated evaluation. We demonstrate that standard "LLM-as-a-Judge" protocols suffer from a systematic Alignment Gap when applied to upper-undergraduate to early graduate level mathematics. To quantify this, we introduce QEDBench, the first large-scale dual-rubric alignment benchmark to systematically measure alignment with human experts on university-level math proofs by contrasting course-specific rubrics against expert common knowledge criteria. By deploying a dual-evaluation matrix (7 judges x 5 solvers) against 1,000+ hours of human evaluation, we reveal that certain frontier evaluators like Claude Opus 4.5, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen 2.5 Max, and Llama 4 Maverick exhibit significant positive bias (up to +0.18, +0.20, +0.30, +0.36 mean score inflation, respectively). Furthermore, we uncover a critical reasoning gap in the discrete domain: while Gemini 3.0 Pro achieves state-of-the-art performance (0.91 average human evaluation score), other reasoning models like GPT-5 Pro and Claude Sonnet 4.5 see their performance significantly degrade in discrete domains. Specifically, their average human evaluation scores drop to 0.72 and 0.63 in Discrete Math, and to 0.74 and 0.50 in Graph Theory. In addition to these research results, we also release QEDBench as a public benchmark for evaluating and improving AI judges. Our benchmark is publicly published at https://github.com/qqliu/Yale-QEDBench.

Abstract: Mobility trajectories are essential for understanding urban dynamics and enhancing urban planning, yet access to such data is frequently hindered by privacy concerns. This research introduces a transformative framework for generating large-scale urban mobility trajectories, employing a novel application of a transformer-based model pre-trained and fine-tuned through a two-phase process. Initially, trajectory generation is conceptualized as an offline reinforcement learning (RL) problem, with a significant reduction in vocabulary space achieved during tokenization. The integration of Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) allows for the capture of trajectory-wise reward signals, leveraging historical data to infer individual mobility preferences. Subsequently, the pre-trained model is fine-tuned using the constructed reward model, effectively addressing the challenges inherent in traditional RL-based autoregressive methods, such as long-term credit assignment and handling of sparse reward environments. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets illustrate that our framework markedly surpasses existing models in terms of reliability and diversity. Our findings not only advance the field of urban mobility modeling but also provide a robust methodology for simulating urban data, with significant implications for traffic management and urban development planning. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/Wangjw6/TrajGPT_R.

Abstract: The rapid growth of dockless bike-sharing systems has generated massive spatio-temporal datasets useful for fleet allocation, congestion reduction, and sustainable mobility. Bike demand, however, depends on several external factors, making traditional time-series models insufficient. Centralized Machine Learning (CML) yields high-accuracy forecasts but raises privacy and bandwidth issues when data are distributed across edge devices. To overcome these limitations, we propose Bikelution, an efficient Federated Learning (FL) solution based on gradient-boosted trees that preserves privacy while delivering accurate mid-term demand forecasts up to six hours ahead. Experiments on three real-world BSS datasets show that Bikelution is comparable to its CML-based variant and outperforms the current state-of-the-art. The results highlight the feasibility of privacy-aware demand forecasting and outline the trade-offs between FL and CML approaches.

Abstract: Urban systems, as dynamic complex systems, continuously generate spatio-temporal data streams that encode the fundamental laws of human mobility and city evolution. While AI for Science has witnessed the transformative power of foundation models in disciplines like genomics and meteorology, urban computing remains fragmented due to "scenario-specific" models, which are overfitted to specific regions or tasks, hindering their generalizability. To bridge this gap and advance spatio-temporal foundation models for urban systems, we adopt scaling as the central perspective and systematically investigate two key questions: what to scale and how to scale. Grounded in first-principles analysis, we identify three critical dimensions: heterogeneity, correlation, and dynamics, aligning these principles with the fundamental scientific properties of urban spatio-temporal data. Specifically, to address heterogeneity through data scaling, we construct WorldST. This billion-scale corpus standardizes diverse physical signals, such as traffic flow and speed, from over 100 global cities into a unified data format. To enable computation scaling for modeling correlations, we introduce the MiniST unit, a novel split mechanism that discretizes continuous spatio-temporal fields into learnable computational units to unify representations of grid-based and sensor-based observations. Finally, addressing dynamics via architecture scaling, we propose UrbanFM, a minimalist self-attention architecture designed with limited inductive biases to autonomously learn dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies from massive data. Furthermore, we establish EvalST, the largest-scale urban spatio-temporal benchmark to date. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UrbanFM achieves remarkable zero-shot generalization across unseen cities and tasks, marking a pivotal first step toward large-scale urban spatio-temporal foundation models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study high-dimensional mean estimation in a collaborative setting where data is contributed by $N$ users in batches of size $n$. In this environment, a learner seeks to recover the mean $μ$ of a true distribution $P$ from a collection of sources that are both statistically heterogeneous and potentially malicious. We formalize this challenge through a double corruption landscape: an $\varepsilon$-fraction of users are entirely adversarial, while the remaining ``good'' users provide data from distributions that are related to $P$, but deviate by a proximity parameter $α$.
  Unlike existing work on the untrusted batch model, which typically measures this deviation via total variation distance in discrete settings, we address the continuous, high-dimensional regime under two natural variants for deviation: (1) good batches are drawn from distributions with a mean-shift of $\sqrtα$, or (2) an $α$-fraction of samples within each good batch are adversarially corrupted. In particular, the second model presents significant new challenges: in high dimensions, unlike discrete settings, even a small fraction of sample-level corruption can shift empirical means and covariances arbitrarily.
  We provide two Sum-of-Squares (SoS) based algorithms to navigate this tiered corruption. Our algorithms achieve the minimax-optimal error rate $O(\sqrt{\varepsilon/n} + \sqrt{d/nN} + \sqrtα)$, demonstrating that while heterogeneity $α$ represents an inherent statistical difficulty, the influence of adversarial users is suppressed by a factor of $1/\sqrt{n}$ due to the internal averaging afforded by the batch structure.

Abstract: Safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) is crucial for achieving high performance while ensuring safety in real-world applications. However, the complex interplay of multiple uncertainty sources in real environments poses significant challenges for interpretable risk assessment and robust decision-making. To address these challenges, we propose Fuz-RL, a fuzzy measure-guided robust framework for safe RL. Specifically, our framework develops a novel fuzzy Bellman operator for estimating robust value functions using Choquet integrals. Theoretically, we prove that solving the Fuz-RL problem (in Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) form) is equivalent to solving distributionally robust safe RL problems (in robust CMDP form), effectively avoiding min-max optimization. Empirical analyses on safe-control-gym and safety-gymnasium scenarios demonstrate that Fuz-RL effectively integrates with existing safe RL baselines in a model-free manner, significantly improving both safety and control performance under various types of uncertainties in observation, action, and dynamics.

Abstract: We propose ECO, a versatile learning paradigm that enables efficient offline self-play for Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO). ECO addresses key limitations in the field through: 1) Paradigm Shift: Moving beyond inefficient online paradigms, we introduce a two-phase offline paradigm consisting of supervised warm-up and iterative Direct Preference Optimization (DPO); 2) Architecture Shift: We deliberately design a Mamba-based architecture to further enhance the efficiency in the offline paradigm; and 3) Progressive Bootstrapping: To stabilize training, we employ a heuristic-based bootstrapping mechanism that ensures continuous policy improvement during training. Comparison results on TSP and CVRP highlight that ECO performs competitively with up-to-date baselines, with significant advantage on the efficiency side in terms of memory utilization and training throughput. We provide further in-depth analysis on the efficiency, throughput and memory usage of ECO. Ablation studies show rationale behind our designs.

Abstract: Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are fundamental to Bayesian computation, but can be computationally intensive, especially in high-dimensional settings. Push-forward generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational auto-encoders and normalising flows offer a computationally efficient alternative for posterior sampling. However, push-forward models are opaque as they lack the modularity of Bayes Theorem, leading to poor generalisation with respect to changes in the likelihood function. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to GAN architecture design by applying deep unfolding to Langevin MCMC algorithms. This paradigm maps fixed-step iterative algorithms onto modular neural networks, yielding architectures that are both flexible and amenable to interpretation. Crucially, our design allows key model parameters to be specified at inference time, offering robustness to changes in the likelihood parameters. We train these unfolded samplers end-to-end using a supervised regularized Wasserstein GAN framework for posterior sampling. Through extensive Bayesian imaging experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves high sampling accuracy and excellent computational efficiency, while retaining the physics consistency, adaptability and interpretability of classical MCMC strategies.

Abstract: The magnitude of parameter updates are considered a key factor in continual learning. However, most existing studies focus on designing diverse update strategies, while a theoretical understanding of the underlying mechanisms remains limited. Therefore, we characterize model's forgetting from the perspective of parameter update magnitude and formalize it as knowledge degradation induced by task-specific drift in the parameter space, which has not been fully captured in previous studies due to their assumption of a unified parameter space. By deriving the optimal parameter update magnitude that minimizes forgetting, we unify two representative update paradigms, frozen training and initialized training, within an optimization framework for constrained parameter updates. Our theoretical results further reveals that sequence tasks with small parameter distances exhibit better generalization and less forgetting under frozen training rather than initialized training. These theoretical insights inspire a novel hybrid parameter update strategy that adaptively adjusts update magnitude based on gradient directions. Experiments on deep neural networks demonstrate that this hybrid approach outperforms standard training strategies, providing new theoretical perspectives and practical inspiration for designing efficient and scalable continual learning algorithms.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) agents achieve remarkable performance but remain far less learning-efficient than humans. While RL agents require extensive self-play games to extract useful signals, humans often need only a few games, improving rapidly by repeatedly revisiting states where mistakes occurred. This idea, known as search control, aims to restart from valuable states rather than always from the initial state. In AlphaZero, prior work Go-Exploit applies this idea by sampling past states from self-play or search trees, but it treats all states equally, regardless of their learning potential. We propose Regret-Guided Search Control (RGSC), which extends AlphaZero with a regret network that learns to identify high-regret states, where the agent's evaluation diverges most from the actual outcome. These states are collected from both self-play trajectories and MCTS nodes, stored in a prioritized regret buffer, and reused as new starting positions. Across 9x9 Go, 10x10 Othello, and 11x11 Hex, RGSC outperforms AlphaZero and Go-Exploit by an average of 77 and 89 Elo, respectively. When training on a well-trained 9x9 Go model, RGSC further improves the win rate against KataGo from 69.3% to 78.2%, while both baselines show no improvement. These results demonstrate that RGSC provides an effective mechanism for search control, improving both efficiency and robustness of AlphaZero training.

Abstract: While reasoning models are increasingly ubiquitous, the effects of reasoning training on a model's internal mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce transcoder adapters, a technique for learning an interpretable approximation of the difference in MLP computation before and after fine-tuning. We apply transcoder adapters to characterize the differences between Qwen2.5-Math-7B and its reasoning-distilled variant, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B. Learned adapters are faithful to the target model's internal computation and next-token predictions. When evaluated on reasoning benchmarks, adapters match the reasoning model's response lengths and typically recover 50-90% of the accuracy gains from reasoning fine-tuning. Adapter features are sparsely activating and interpretable. When examining adapter features, we find that only ~8% have activating examples directly related to reasoning behaviors. We deeply study one such behavior -- the production of hesitation tokens (e.g., "wait"). Using attribution graphs, we trace hesitation to only ~2.4% of adapter features (5.6k total) performing one of two functions. These features are necessary and sufficient for producing hesitation tokens; removing them reduces response length, often without affecting accuracy. Overall, our results provide insight into reasoning training and suggest transcoder adapters may be useful for studying fine-tuning more broadly.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to learn new classes without forgetting old ones. A common method is to freeze a pre-trained model and train a new, lightweight adapter for each task. While this prevents forgetting, it treats the learned knowledge as a simple, unstructured collection and fails to use the relationships between tasks. To this end, we propose the Semantic-guided Adaptive Expert Forest (SAEF), a new method that organizes adapters into a structured hierarchy for better knowledge sharing. SAEF first groups tasks into conceptual clusters based on their semantic relationships. Then, within each cluster, it builds a balanced expert tree by creating new adapters from merging the adapters of similar tasks. At inference time, SAEF finds and activates a set of relevant experts from the forest for any given input. The final prediction is made by combining the outputs of these activated experts, weighted by how confident each expert is. Experiments on several benchmark datasets show that SAEF achieves SOTA performance.

Abstract: An electroencephalogram (EEG) records the spatially averaged electrical activity of neurons in the brain, measured from the human scalp. Prior studies have explored EEG-based classification of objects or concepts, often for passive viewing of briefly presented image or video stimuli, with limited classes. Because EEG exhibits a low signal-to-noise ratio, recognizing fine-grained representations across a large number of classes remains challenging; however, abstract-level object representations may exist. In this work, we investigate whether EEG captures object representations across multiple hierarchical levels, and propose episodic analysis, in which a Machine Learning (ML) model is evaluated across various, yet related, classification tasks (episodes). Unlike prior episodic EEG studies that rely on fixed or randomly sampled classes of equal cardinality, we adopt hierarchy-aware episode sampling using WordNet to generate episodes with variable classes of diverse hierarchy. We also present the largest episodic framework in the EEG domain for detecting observed text from EEG signals in the PEERS dataset, comprising $931538$ EEG samples under $1610$ object labels, acquired from $264$ human participants (subjects) performing controlled cognitive tasks, enabling the study of neural dynamics underlying perception, decision-making, and performance monitoring.
  We examine how the semantic abstraction level affects classification performance across multiple learning techniques and architectures, providing a comprehensive analysis. The models tend to improve performance when the classification categories are drawn from higher levels of the hierarchy, suggesting sensitivity to abstraction. Our work highlights abstraction depth as an underexplored dimension of EEG decoding and motivates future research in this direction.

Abstract: Several variations of adaptive first-order and second-order optimization methods have been proposed to accelerate and scale the training of large language models. The performance of these optimization routines is highly sensitive to the choice of hyperparameters (HPs), which are computationally expensive to tune for large-scale models. Maximal update parameterization $(μ$P$)$ is a set of scaling rules which aims to make the optimal HPs independent of the model size, thereby allowing the HPs tuned on a smaller (computationally cheaper) model to be transferred to train a larger, target model. Despite promising results for SGD and Adam, deriving $μ$P for other optimizers is challenging because the underlying tensor programming approach is difficult to grasp. Building on recent work that introduced spectral conditions as an alternative to tensor programs, we propose a novel framework to derive $μ$P for a broader class of optimizers, including AdamW, ADOPT, LAMB, Sophia, Shampoo and Muon. We implement our $μ$P derivations on multiple benchmark models and demonstrate zero-shot learning rate transfer across increasing model width for the above optimizers. Further, we provide empirical insights into depth-scaling parameterization for these optimizers.

Abstract: The performance and ease of use of deep learning-based binary classifiers have improved significantly in recent years. This has opened up the potential for automating critical inspection tasks, which have traditionally only been trusted to be done manually. However, the application of binary classifiers in critical operations depends on the estimation of reliable confidence bounds such that system performance can be ensured up to a given statistical significance. We present Wilson Score Kernel Density Classification, which is a novel kernel-based method for estimating confidence bounds in binary classification. The core of our method is the Wilson Score Kernel Density Estimator, which is a function estimator for estimating confidence bounds in Binomial experiments with conditionally varying success probabilities. Our method is evaluated in the context of selective classification on four different datasets, illustrating its use as a classification head of any feature extractor, including vision foundation models. Our proposed method shows similar performance to Gaussian Process Classification, but at a lower computational complexity.

Abstract: Bubeck and Sellke (2021) pose as an open problem the connection between the law of robustness and robust generalization. The law of robustness states that overparameterization is necessary for models to interpolate robustly; in particular, robust interpolation requires the learned function to be Lipschitz. Robust generalization asks whether small robust training loss implies small robust test loss. We resolve this problem by explicitly connecting the two for arbitrary data distributions. Specifically, we introduce a nontrivial notion of robust generalization error and convert it into a lower bound on the expected Rademacher complexity of the induced robust loss class. Our bounds recover the $Ω(n^{1/d})$ regime of Wu et al.\ (2023) and show that, up to constants, robust generalization does not change the order of the Lipschitz constant required for smooth interpolation. We conduct experiments to probe the predicted scaling with dataset size and model capacity, testing whether empirical behavior aligns more closely with the predictions of Bubeck and Sellke (2021) or Wu et al.\ (2023). For MNIST, we find that the lower-bound Lipschitz constant scales on the order predicted by Wu et al.\ (2023). Informally, to obtain low robust generalization error, the Lipschitz constant must lie in a range that we bound, and the allowable perturbation radius is linked to the Lipschitz scale.

Abstract: In engineering design and scientific computing, computational cost and predictive accuracy are intrinsically coupled. High-fidelity simulations provide accurate predictions but at substantial computational costs, while lower-fidelity approximations offer efficiency at the expense of accuracy. Multi-fidelity surrogate modelling addresses this trade-off by combining abundant low-fidelity data with sparse high-fidelity observations. However, existing methods suffer from expensive training cost or rely on global correlation assumptions that often fail in practice to capture how fidelity relationships vary across the input space, leading to poor performance particularly under tight budget constraints. We introduce MAST, a method that blends corrected low-fidelity observations with high-fidelity predictions, trusting high-fidelity near observed samples and relying on corrected low-fidelity elsewhere. MAST achieves this through explicit discrepancy modelling and distance-based weighting with closed-form variance propagation, producing a single heteroscedastic Gaussian process. Across multi-fidelity synthetic benchmarks, MAST shows a marked improvement over the current state-of-the-art techniques. Crucially, MAST maintains robust performance across varying total budget and fidelity gaps, conditions under which competing methods exhibit significant degradation or unstable behaviour.

Abstract: Multi-agent imitation learning (MA-IL) aims to learn optimal policies from expert demonstrations of interactions in multi-agent interactive domains. Despite existing guarantees on the performance of the resulting learned policies, characterizations of how far the learned polices are from a Nash equilibrium are missing for offline MA-IL. In this paper, we demonstrate impossibility and hardness results of learning low-exploitable policies in general $n$-player Markov Games. We do so by providing examples where even exact measure matching fails, and demonstrating a new hardness result on characterizing the Nash gap given a fixed measure matching error. We then show how these challenges can be overcome using strategic dominance assumptions on the expert equilibrium. Specifically, for the case of dominant strategy expert equilibria, assuming Behavioral Cloning error $ε_{\text{BC}}$, this provides a Nash imitation gap of $\mathcal{O}\left(nε_{\text{BC}}/(1-γ)^2\right)$ for a discount factor $γ$. We generalize this result with a new notion of best-response continuity, and argue that this is implicitly encouraged by standard regularization techniques.

Abstract: Imputing missing values in multivariate time series remains challenging, especially under diverse missing patterns and heavy missingness. Existing methods suffer from suboptimal performance as corrupted temporal features hinder effective cross-variable information transfer, amplifying reconstruction errors. Robust imputation requires both extracting temporal patterns from sparse observations within each variable and selectively transferring information across variables--yet current approaches excel at one while compromising the other. We introduce T1 (Time series imputation with 1-to-1 channel-head binding), a CNN-Transformer hybrid architecture that achieves robust imputation through Channel-Head Binding--a mechanism creating one-to-one correspondence between CNN channels and attention heads. This design enables selective information transfer: when missingness corrupts certain temporal patterns, their corresponding attention pathways adaptively down-weight based on remaining observable patterns while preserving reliable cross-variable connections through unaffected channels. Experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that T1 achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing MSE by 46% on average compared to the second-best baseline, with particularly strong gains under extreme sparsity (70% missing ratio). The model generalizes to unseen missing patterns without retraining and uses a consistent hyperparameter configuration across all datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/Oppenheimerdinger/T1.

Abstract: Recent deep learning methods for fMRI-based diagnosis have achieved promising accuracy by modeling functional connectivity networks. However, standard approaches often struggle with noisy interactions, and conventional post-hoc attribution methods may lack reliability, potentially highlighting dataset-specific artifacts. To address these challenges, we introduce PIME, an interpretable framework that bridges intrinsic interpretability with minimal-sufficient subgraph optimization by integrating prototype-based classification and consistency training with structural perturbations during learning. This encourages a structured latent space and enables Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) under a prototype-consistent objective to extract compact minimal-sufficient explanatory subgraphs post-training. Experiments on three benchmark fMRI datasets demonstrate that PIME achieves state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, by constraining the search space via learned prototypes, PIME identifies critical brain regions that are consistent with established neuroimaging findings. Stability analysis shows 90% reproducibility and consistent explanations across atlases.

Motivation: 现有的离策略离线强化学习方法通常在整个状态空间上全局处理动态不匹配问题，或者通过逐点数据筛选，这些方法可能忽略跨域的局部相似性且计算成本较高。

Method: 提出LoDADA方法，通过对源域和目标域数据进行聚类，估计簇级别的动态差异，保留差异小的源域数据，过滤差异大的数据。

Result: 在多环境的实验中，LoDADA在具有全局和局部动态偏移的环境中持续优于最先进的离策略离线强化学习方法。

Conclusion: LoDADA通过利用局部化动态不匹配，实现了更精细和可扩展的数据选择，能更好地复用源域数据，提升离策略离线强化学习性能。

Abstract: Off-dynamics offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn a policy for a target domain using limited target data and abundant source data collected under different transition dynamics. Existing methods typically address dynamics mismatch either globally over the state space or via pointwise data filtering; these approaches can miss localized cross-domain similarities or incur high computational cost. We propose Localized Dynamics-Aware Domain Adaptation (LoDADA), which exploits localized dynamics mismatch to better reuse source data. LoDADA clusters transitions from source and target datasets and estimates cluster-level dynamics discrepancy via domain discrimination. Source transitions from clusters with small discrepancy are retained, while those from clusters with large discrepancy are filtered out. This yields a fine-grained and scalable data selection strategy that avoids overly coarse global assumptions and expensive per-sample filtering. We provide theoretical insights and extensive experiments across environments with diverse global and local dynamics shifts. Results show that LoDADA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art off-dynamics offline RL methods by better leveraging localized distribution mismatch.

Abstract: Federated Semi-Supervised Learning (FSSL) aims to collaboratively train a global model across clients by leveraging partially-annotated local data in a privacy-preserving manner. In FSSL, data heterogeneity is a challenging issue, which exists both across clients and within clients. External heterogeneity refers to the data distribution discrepancy across different clients, while internal heterogeneity represents the mismatch between labeled and unlabeled data within clients. Most FSSL methods typically design fixed or dynamic parameter aggregation strategies to collect client knowledge on the server (external) and / or filter out low-confidence unlabeled samples to reduce mistakes in local client (internal). But, the former is hard to precisely fit the ideal global distribution via direct weights, and the latter results in fewer data participation into FL training. To this end, we propose a proxy-guided framework called ProxyFL that focuses on simultaneously mitigating external and internal heterogeneity via a unified proxy. I.e., we consider the learnable weights of classifier as proxy to simulate the category distribution both locally and globally. For external, we explicitly optimize global proxy against outliers instead of direct weights; for internal, we re-include the discarded samples into training by a positive-negative proxy pool to mitigate the impact of potentially-incorrect pseudo-labels. Insight experiments & theoretical analysis show our significant performance and convergence in FSSL.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in image processing tasks by utilizing self-attention mechanisms to capture global relationships within data. However, their scalability is hindered by significant computational and memory demands, especially for large-scale models with many parameters. This study aims to leverage DeepSpeed, a highly efficient distributed training framework that is commonly used for language models, to enhance the scalability and performance of ViTs. We evaluate intra- and inter-node training efficiency across multiple GPU configurations on various datasets like CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, exploring the impact of distributed data parallelism on training speed, communication overhead, and overall scalability (strong and weak scaling). By systematically varying software parameters, such as batch size and gradient accumulation, we identify key factors influencing performance of distributed training. The experiments in this study provide a foundational basis for applying DeepSpeed to image-related tasks. Future work will extend these investigations to deepen our understanding of DeepSpeed's limitations and explore strategies for optimizing distributed training pipelines for Vision Transformers.

Abstract: Curvature notions on graphs provide a theoretical description of graph topology, highlighting bottlenecks and denser connected regions. Artifacts of the message passing paradigm in Graph Neural Networks, such as oversmoothing and oversquashing, have been attributed to these regions. However, it remains unclear how the topology of a graph interacts with the learned preferences of GNNs. Through Massive Activations, which correspond to extreme edge activation values in Graph Transformers, we probe this correspondence. Our findings on synthetic graphs and molecular benchmarks reveal that MAs do not preferentially concentrate on curvature extremes, despite their theoretical link to information flow. On the Long Range Graph Benchmark, we identify a systemic \textit{curvature shift}: global attention mechanisms exacerbate topological bottlenecks, drastically increasing the prevalence of negative curvature. Our work reframes curvature as a diagnostic probe for understanding when and why graph learning fails.

Abstract: We revisit the central online problem of ski rental in the "algorithms with predictions" framework from the point of view of distributional predictions. Ski rental was one of the first problems to be studied with predictions, where a natural prediction is simply the number of ski days. But it is both more natural and potentially more powerful to think of a prediction as a distribution p-hat over the ski days. If the true number of ski days is drawn from some true (but unknown) distribution p, then we show as our main result that there is an algorithm with expected cost at most OPT + O(min(max({eta}, 1) * sqrt(b), b log b)), where OPT is the expected cost of the optimal policy for the true distribution p, b is the cost of buying, and {eta} is the Earth Mover's (Wasserstein-1) distance between p and p-hat. Note that when {eta} < o(sqrt(b)) this gives additive loss less than b (the trivial bound), and when {eta} is arbitrarily large (corresponding to an extremely inaccurate prediction) we still do not pay more than O(b log b) additive loss. An implication of these bounds is that our algorithm has consistency O(sqrt(b)) (additive loss when the prediction error is 0) and robustness O(b log b) (additive loss when the prediction error is arbitrarily large). Moreover, we do not need to assume that we know (or have any bound on) the prediction error {eta}, in contrast with previous work in robust optimization which assumes that we know this error.
  We complement this upper bound with a variety of lower bounds showing that it is essentially tight: not only can the consistency/robustness tradeoff not be improved, but our particular loss function cannot be meaningfully improved.

Abstract: Vector-quantized representations enable powerful discrete generative models but lack semantic structure in token space, limiting interpretable human control. We introduce SOM-VQ, a tokenization method that combines vector quantization with Self-Organizing Maps to learn discrete codebooks with explicit low-dimensional topology. Unlike standard VQ-VAE, SOM-VQ uses topology-aware updates that preserve neighborhood structure: nearby tokens on a learned grid correspond to semantically similar states, enabling direct geometric manipulation of the latent space. We demonstrate that SOM-VQ produces more learnable token sequences in the evaluated domains while providing an explicit navigable geometry in code space. Critically, the topological organization enables intuitive human-in-the-loop control: users can steer generation by manipulating distances in token space, achieving semantic alignment without frame-level constraints. We focus on human motion generation - a domain where kinematic structure, smooth temporal continuity, and interactive use cases (choreography, rehabilitation, HCI) make topology-aware control especially natural - demonstrating controlled divergence and convergence from reference sequences through simple grid-based sampling. SOM-VQ provides a general framework for interpretable discrete representations applicable to music, gesture, and other interactive generative domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统反事实推理方法假设特征独立且同时可修改，但这些假设违反了纵向临床数据的实际情况。为了能够基于时间依赖性提出临床上有意义的“如果在不同时间点进行干预会怎样”的问题，需要开发能够处理医疗记录中时序依赖关系的新方法。

Method: 开发了序列反事实框架，对电子健康记录中的时间依赖关系进行建模：1）区分不可变特征（如慢性诊断）和可控特征（如实验室值）；2）模拟干预措施随时间的传播。在2732名COVID-19患者（383名长期COVID心力衰竭病例，2340名匹配对照）数据上应用该方法。

Result: 研究发现38-67%的慢性病患者在朴素方法下需要生物学上不可能的反事实。识别出了一个心肾级联（CKD->AKI->HF），每个步骤的相对风险分别为2.27和1.19，展示了只有序列反事实才能捕捉的时间传播效应。

Conclusion: 该框架将反事实解释从“如果这个特征不同会怎样”转变为“如果我们更早干预会怎样，这种干预将如何向前传播”，为临床决策提供了基于生物学合理性的可操作见解。

Abstract: Counterfactual inference enables clinicians to ask "what if" questions about patient outcomes, but standard methods assume feature independence and simultaneous modifiability -- assumptions violated by longitudinal clinical data. We introduce the Sequential Counterfactual Framework, which respects temporal dependencies in electronic health records by distinguishing immutable features (chronic diagnoses) from controllable features (lab values) and modeling how interventions propagate through time. Applied to 2,723 COVID-19 patients (383 Long COVID heart failure cases, 2,340 matched controls), we demonstrate that 38-67% of patients with chronic conditions would require biologically impossible counterfactuals under naive methods. We identify a cardiorenal cascade (CKD -> AKI -> HF) with relative risks of 2.27 and 1.19 at each step, illustrating temporal propagation that sequential -- but not naive -- counterfactuals can capture. Our framework transforms counterfactual explanation from "what if this feature were different?" to "what if we had intervened earlier, and how would that propagate forward?" --  yielding clinically actionable insights grounded in biological plausibility.

Conclusion: 这些发现对Masked扩散是扩散语言建模必然方向的假设提出质疑，证明Uniform-state扩散配合PC采样器具有持续改进潜力

Abstract: Uniform-state discrete diffusion models excel at few-step generation and guidance due to their ability to self-correct, making them preferred over autoregressive or Masked diffusion models in these settings. However, their sampling quality plateaus with ancestral samplers as the number of steps increases. We introduce a family of Predictor-Corrector (PC) samplers for discrete diffusion that generalize prior methods and apply to arbitrary noise processes. When paired with uniform-state diffusion, our samplers outperform ancestral sampling on both language and image modeling, achieving lower generative perplexity at matched unigram entropy on OpenWebText and better FID/IS scores on CIFAR10. Crucially, unlike conventional samplers, our PC methods continue to improve with more sampling steps. Taken together, these findings call into question the assumption that Masked diffusion is the inevitable future of diffusion-based language modeling. Beyond sampling, we develop a memory-efficient curriculum for the Gaussian relaxation training phase, reducing training time by 25% and memory by 33% compared to Duo while maintaining comparable perplexity on OpenWebText and LM1B and strong downstream performance. We release code, checkpoints, and a video-tutorial on: https://s-sahoo.com/duo-ch2

Abstract: Pass@k is a widely used performance metric for verifiable large language model tasks, including mathematical reasoning, code generation, and short-answer reasoning. It defines success if any of $k$ independently sampled solutions passes a verifier. This multi-sample inference metric has motivated inference-aware fine-tuning methods that directly optimize pass@$k$. However, prior work reports a recurring trade-off: pass@k improves while pass@1 degrades under such methods. This trade-off is practically important because pass@1 often remains a hard operational constraint due to latency and cost budgets, imperfect verifier coverage, and the need for a reliable single-shot fallback. We study the origin of this trade-off and provide a theoretical characterization of when pass@k policy optimization can reduce pass@1 through gradient conflict induced by prompt interference. We show that pass@$k$ policy gradients can conflict with pass@1 gradients because pass@$k$ optimization implicitly reweights prompts toward low-success prompts; when these prompts are what we term negatively interfering, their upweighting can rotate the pass@k update direction away from the pass@1 direction. We illustrate our theoretical findings with large language model experiments on verifiable mathematical reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study the complexity of smoothed agnostic learning, recently introduced by~\cite{CKKMS24}, in which the learner competes with the best classifier in a target class under slight Gaussian perturbations of the inputs. Specifically, we focus on the prototypical task of agnostically learning halfspaces under subgaussian distributions in the smoothed model. The best known upper bound for this problem relies on $L_1$-polynomial regression and has complexity $d^{\tilde{O}(1/σ^2) \log(1/ε)}$, where $σ$ is the smoothing parameter and $ε$ is the excess error. Our main result is a Statistical Query (SQ) lower bound providing formal evidence that this upper bound is close to best possible. In more detail, we show that (even for Gaussian marginals) any SQ algorithm for smoothed agnostic learning of halfspaces requires complexity $d^{Ω(1/σ^{2}+\log(1/ε))}$. This is the first non-trivial lower bound on the complexity of this task and nearly matches the known upper bound. Roughly speaking, we show that applying $L_1$-polynomial regression to a smoothed version of the function is essentially best possible. Our techniques involve finding a moment-matching hard distribution by way of linear programming duality. This dual program corresponds exactly to finding a low-degree approximating polynomial to the smoothed version of the target function (which turns out to be the same condition required for the $L_1$-polynomial regression to work). Our explicit SQ lower bound then comes from proving lower bounds on this approximation degree for the class of halfspaces.

Abstract: Efficiently processing long sequences with Transformer models usually requires splitting the computations across accelerators via context parallelism. The dominant approaches in this family of methods, such as Ring Attention or DeepSpeed Ulysses, enable scaling over the context dimension but do not focus on memory efficiency, which limits the sequence lengths they can support. More advanced techniques, such as Fully Pipelined Distributed Transformer or activation offloading, can further extend the possible context length at the cost of training throughput. In this paper, we present UPipe, a simple yet effective context parallelism technique that performs fine-grained chunking at the attention head level. This technique significantly reduces the activation memory usage of self-attention, breaking the activation memory barrier and unlocking much longer context lengths. Our approach reduces intermediate tensor memory usage in the attention layer by as much as 87.5$\%$ for 32B Transformers, while matching previous context parallelism techniques in terms of training speed. UPipe can support the context length of 5M tokens when training Llama3-8B on a single 8$\times$H100 node, improving upon prior methods by over 25$\%$.

Abstract: Embodied LLMs endow robots with high-level task reasoning, but they cannot reflect on what went wrong or why, turning deployment into a sequence of independent trials where mistakes repeat rather than accumulate into experience. Drawing upon human reflective practitioners, we introduce Reflective Test-Time Planning, which integrates two modes of reflection: \textit{reflection-in-action}, where the agent uses test-time scaling to generate and score multiple candidate actions using internal reflections before execution; and \textit{reflection-on-action}, which uses test-time training to update both its internal reflection model and its action policy based on external reflections after execution. We also include retrospective reflection, allowing the agent to re-evaluate earlier decisions and perform model updates with hindsight for proper long-horizon credit assignment. Experiments on our newly-designed Long-Horizon Household benchmark and MuJoCo Cupboard Fitting benchmark show significant gains over baseline models, with ablative studies validating the complementary roles of reflection-in-action and reflection-on-action. Qualitative analyses, including real-robot trials, highlight behavioral correction through reflection.

Abstract: Test-time training (TTT) with KV binding as sequence modeling layer is commonly interpreted as a form of online meta-learning that memorizes a key-value mapping at test time. However, our analysis reveals multiple phenomena that contradict this memorization-based interpretation. Motivated by these findings, we revisit the formulation of TTT and show that a broad class of TTT architectures can be expressed as a form of learned linear attention operator. Beyond explaining previously puzzling model behaviors, this perspective yields multiple practical benefits: it enables principled architectural simplifications, admits fully parallel formulations that preserve performance while improving efficiency, and provides a systematic reduction of diverse TTT variants to a standard linear attention form. Overall, our results reframe TTT not as test-time memorization, but as learned linear attention with enhanced representational capacity.
