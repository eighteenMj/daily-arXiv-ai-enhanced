### [1] [Bi-Orthogonal Factor Decomposition for Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05328)
*Fenil R. Doshi,Thomas Fel,Talia Konkle,George Alvarez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Bi-orthogonal Factor Decomposition（BFD）是一个两阶段分析框架，通过统计学方法分离注意力机制中的位置和内容因素，揭示视觉transformers中tokens如何通过位置和语义信息进行交互。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对视觉transformer中注意力机制的理解有限，特别是难以区分查询和键在交互时交换的是位置信息、内容信息还是两者兼有。需要一种系统方法来解耦注意力机制中的位置和内容因素。

Method: BFD包含两个阶段：1）基于ANOVA的分解方法在统计学上分离token激活值为正交的位置因子和内容因子；2）查询-键交互矩阵QK^T的奇异值分解揭示这些因子如何介导通信的双正交模式。

Result: 在验证了位置和内容的正确分离后，应用BFD到最先进的视觉模型中发现了三个现象：1）注意力主要通过内容操作，内容-内容交互占主导；2）注意力头专门化为不同类型操作器；3）DINOv2的优越形状处理能力源自其保留位置结构同时丰富语义内容的中间层。

Conclusion: BFD揭示了tokens如何通过注意力机制交互以及哪些信息因素（位置或语义）介导它们的通信，为理解视觉transformer机制提供了实用洞见。

Abstract: Self-attention is the central computational primitive of Vision Transformers, yet we lack a principled understanding of what information attention mechanisms exchange between tokens. Attention maps describe where weight mass concentrates; they do not reveal whether queries and keys trade position, content, or both. We introduce Bi-orthogonal Factor Decomposition (BFD), a two-stage analytical framework: first, an ANOVA-based decomposition statistically disentangles token activations into orthogonal positional and content factors; second, SVD of the query-key interaction matrix QK^T exposes bi-orthogonal modes that reveal how these factors mediate communication. After validating proper isolation of position and content, we apply BFD to state-of-the-art vision models and uncover three phenomena.(i) Attention operates primarily through content. Content-content interactions dominate attention energy, followed by content-position coupling. DINOv2 allocates more energy to content-position than supervised models and distributes computation across a richer mode spectrum. (ii) Attention mechanisms exhibit specialization: heads differentiate into content-content, content-position, and position-position operators, while singular modes within heads show analogous specialization. (iii) DINOv2's superior holistic shape processing emerges from intermediate layers that simultaneously preserve positional structure while contextually enriching semantic content.
  Overall, BFD exposes how tokens interact through attention and which informational factors - positional or semantic - mediate their communication, yielding practical insights into vision transformer mechanisms.

TL;DR: VLMs能识别图像中的系统并生成代码模拟，但难以复制精细细节


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究视觉语言模型理解并模拟图像中复杂系统的能力，验证其视觉理解深度

Method: 使用Im2Sim方法：让VLM描述图像中的系统并编写生成代码，执行后比较合成图像与原图像

Result: 主流VLM（GPT、Gemini）能理解复杂多组件系统，但在细节重现方面表现有限

Conclusion: VLMs在高层视觉理解与低层细节感知之间存在不对称性：对复杂系统有深刻理解，但处理精细结构有限

Abstract: The ability to construct mental models of the world is a central aspect of understanding. Similarly, visual understanding can be viewed as the ability to construct a representative model of the system depicted in an image. This work explores the capacity of Vision Language Models (VLMs) to recognize and simulate the systems and mechanisms depicted in images using the Im2Sim methodology. The VLM is given a natural image of a real-world system (e.g., cities, clouds, vegetation) and is tasked with describing the system and writing code that simulates and generates it. This generative code is then executed to produce a synthetic image, which is compared against the original. This approach is tested on various complex emergent systems, ranging from physical systems (waves, lights, clouds) to vegetation, cities, materials, and geological formations. Through analysis of the models and images generated by the VLMs, we examine their understanding of the systems in images. The results show that leading VLMs (GPT, Gemini) demonstrate the capacity to understand and model complex, multi-component systems across multiple layers of abstraction and a wide range of domains. At the same time, the VLMs exhibit limited ability to replicate fine details and low-level arrangements of patterns in the image. These findings reveal an interesting asymmetry: VLMs combine high-level, deep visual understanding of images with limited perception of fine details.

Abstract: Recent advancements in lightweight neural networks have significantly improved the efficiency of deploying deep learning models on edge hardware. However, most existing architectures still trade accuracy for latency, which limits their applicability on microcontroller and neural processing unit based devices. In this work, we introduce two new model families, STResNet for image classification and STYOLO for object detection, jointly optimized for accuracy, efficiency, and memory footprint on resource constrained platforms. The proposed STResNet series, ranging from Nano to Tiny variants, achieves competitive ImageNet 1K accuracy within a four million parameter budget. Specifically, STResNetMilli attains 70.0 percent Top 1 accuracy with only three million parameters, outperforming MobileNetV1 and ShuffleNetV2 at comparable computational complexity. For object detection, STYOLOMicro and STYOLOMilli achieve 30.5 percent and 33.6 percent mean average precision, respectively, on the MS COCO dataset, surpassing YOLOv5n and YOLOX Nano in both accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, when STResNetMilli is used as a backbone with the Ultralytics training environment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present MOSAIC-GS, a novel, fully explicit, and computationally efficient approach for high-fidelity dynamic scene reconstruction from monocular videos using Gaussian Splatting. Monocular reconstruction is inherently ill-posed due to the lack of sufficient multiview constraints, making accurate recovery of object geometry and temporal coherence particularly challenging. To address this, we leverage multiple geometric cues, such as depth, optical flow, dynamic object segmentation, and point tracking. Combined with rigidity-based motion constraints, these cues allow us to estimate preliminary 3D scene dynamics during an initialization stage. Recovering scene dynamics prior to the photometric optimization reduces reliance on motion inference from visual appearance alone, which is often ambiguous in monocular settings. To enable compact representations, fast training, and real-time rendering while supporting non-rigid deformations, the scene is decomposed into static and dynamic components. Each Gaussian in the dynamic part of the scene is assigned a trajectory represented as time-dependent Poly-Fourier curve for parameter-efficient motion encoding. We demonstrate that MOSAIC-GS achieves substantially faster optimization and rendering compared to existing methods, while maintaining reconstruction quality on par with state-of-the-art approaches across standard monocular dynamic scene benchmarks.

Abstract: Early diagnosis of breast cancer is crucial for improving survival rates. Radiomics and deep learning (DL) have shown significant potential in assisting radiologists with early cancer detection. This paper aims to critically assess the performance of radiomics, DL, and ensemble techniques in detecting cancer from screening mammograms. Two independent datasets were used: the RSNA 2023 Breast Cancer Detection Challenge (11,913 patients) and a Mexican cohort from the TecSalud dataset (19,400 patients). The ConvNeXtV1-small DL model was trained on the RSNA dataset and validated on the TecSalud dataset, while radiomics models were developed using the TecSalud dataset and validated with a leave-one-year-out approach. The ensemble method consistently combined and calibrated predictions using the same methodology. Results showed that the ensemble approach achieved the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.87, compared to 0.83 for ConvNeXtV1-small and 0.80 for radiomics. In conclusion, ensemble methods combining DL and radiomics predictions significantly enhance breast cancer diagnosis from mammograms.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks on edge devices is often limited by the memory traffic and compute cost of dense linear operators. While quaternion neural networks improve parameter efficiency by coupling multiple channels through Hamilton products, they typically retain unstructured dense weights; conversely, structured matrices enable fast computation but are usually applied in the real domain. This paper introduces EdgeLDR, a practical framework for quaternion block-circulant linear and convolutional layers that combines quaternion channel mixing with block-circulant parameter structure and enables FFT-based evaluation through the complex adjoint representation. We present reference implementations of EdgeLDR layers and compare FFT-based computation against a naive spatial-domain realization of quaternion circulant products. FFT evaluation yields large empirical speedups over the naive implementation and keeps latency stable as block size increases, making larger compression factors computationally viable. We further integrate EdgeLDR layers into compact CNN and Transformer backbones and evaluate accuracy-compression trade-offs on 32x32 RGB classification (CIFAR-10/100, SVHN) and hyperspectral image classification (Houston 2013, Pavia University), reporting parameter counts and CPU/GPU latency. The results show that EdgeLDR layers provide significant compression with competitive accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个多任务学习框架来微调BiomedCLIP模型，以提升胸部X光图像的跨模态检索性能，在图像-文本双向检索任务中取得了更平衡且临床意义更强的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP和BiomedCLIP等视觉-语言基础模型虽然提供强力的跨模态嵌入，但未针对细粒度医疗检索任务（如通过胸部X光图像查询临床相关放射学报告）进行优化。

Method: 以BiomedCLIP为骨干，加入轻量级MLP投影头，使用包含三项损失的多任务复合损失函数进行训练：1）区分正常/异常CXR研究的二元交叉熵损失；2）增强类内一致性的监督对比损失；3）保持跨模态对齐的CLIP损失。

Result: 微调后的模型在图像到文本和文本到图像检索任务中，相比预训练的BiomedCLIP和通用CLIP模型，实现了更平衡且临床意义更强的性能；t-SNE可视化显示正常和异常病例的语义聚类更清晰。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明领域自适应的多任务学习对于推进生物医学应用中的跨模态检索具有重要价值。

Abstract: CLIP and BiomedCLIP are examples of vision-language foundation models and offer strong cross-modal embeddings; however, they are not optimized for fine-grained medical retrieval tasks, such as retrieving clinically relevant radiology reports using chest X-ray (CXR) image queries. To address this shortcoming, we propose a multi-task learning framework to fine-tune BiomedCLIP and evaluate improvements to CXR image-text retrieval. Using BiomedCLIP as the backbone, we incorporate a lightweight MLP projector head trained with a multi-task composite loss function that includes: (1) a binary cross-entropy loss to distinguish normal from abnormal CXR studies, (2) a supervised contrastive loss to reinforce intra-class consistency, and (3) a CLIP loss to maintain cross-modal alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that the fine-tuned model achieves more balanced and clinically meaningful performance across both image-to-text and text-to-image retrieval tasks compared to the pretrained BiomedCLIP and general-purpose CLIP models. Furthermore, t-SNE visualizations reveal clearer semantic clustering of normal and abnormal cases, demonstrating the model's enhanced diagnostic sensitivity. These findings highlight the value of domain-adaptive, multi-task learning for advancing cross-modal retrieval in biomedical applications.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种让视觉语言模型具备'地图思维'能力的图像地理定位方法，采用'地图中智能体循环'框架，通过两阶段优化方案显著提升了地理定位准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大规模视觉语言模型方法虽然利用世界知识、思维链推理和智能体能力进行图像地理定位，但忽略了人类常用的策略——使用地图。为了解决这一局限，作者旨在为模型配备'地图思维'能力。

Method: 1. 提出'地图中智能体循环'框架，让模型具备地图思维能力；2. 开发两阶段优化方案：首先进行智能体强化学习(RL)以提高采样效率，然后进行并行测试时缩放(TTS)让模型在最终预测前探索多个候选路径；3. 构建MAPBench基准数据集，包含完全来自真实世界的图像用于训练和评估。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在大多数指标上优于现有开源和闭源模型，特别是与Gemini-3-Pro（谷歌搜索/地图接地模式）相比，将Acc@500m从8.0%提高到22.1%，取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: 通过赋予模型地图思维能力并使用两阶段优化方案，该方法在图像地理定位任务上取得了实质性进展，证明了在地理定位中结合地图使用的重要性。

Abstract: The image geolocalization task aims to predict the location where an image was taken anywhere on Earth using visual clues. Existing large vision-language model (LVLM) approaches leverage world knowledge, chain-of-thought reasoning, and agentic capabilities, but overlook a common strategy used by humans -- using maps. In this work, we first equip the model \textit{Thinking with Map} ability and formulate it as an agent-in-the-map loop. We develop a two-stage optimization scheme for it, including agentic reinforcement learning (RL) followed by parallel test-time scaling (TTS). The RL strengthens the agentic capability of model to improve sampling efficiency, and the parallel TTS enables the model to explore multiple candidate paths before making the final prediction, which is crucial for geolocalization. To evaluate our method on up-to-date and in-the-wild images, we further present MAPBench, a comprehensive geolocalization training and evaluation benchmark composed entirely of real-world images. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing open- and closed-source models on most metrics, specifically improving Acc@500m from 8.0\% to 22.1\% compared to \textit{Gemini-3-Pro} with Google Search/Map grounded mode.

Abstract: Understanding plant root systems is critical for advancing research in soil-plant interactions, nutrient uptake, and overall plant health. However, accurate imaging of roots in subterranean environments remains a persistent challenge due to adverse conditions such as occlusion, varying soil moisture, and inherently low contrast, which limit the effectiveness of conventional vision-based approaches. In this work, we propose a novel underground imaging system that captures multiple overlapping views of plant roots and integrates a deep learning-based Multi-Image Super Resolution (MISR) framework designed to enhance root visibility and detail. To train and evaluate our approach, we construct a synthetic dataset that simulates realistic underground imaging scenarios, incorporating key environmental factors that affect image quality. Our proposed MISR algorithm leverages spatial redundancy across views to reconstruct high-resolution images with improved structural fidelity and visual clarity. Quantitative evaluations show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art super resolution baselines, achieving a 2.3 percent reduction in BRISQUE, indicating improved image quality with the same CLIP-IQA score, thereby enabling enhanced phenotypic analysis of root systems. This, in turn, facilitates accurate estimation of critical root traits, including root hair count and root hair density. The proposed framework presents a promising direction for robust automatic underground plant root imaging and trait quantification for agricultural and ecological research.

TL;DR: 本研究通过体素形态测量方法分析阿尔茨海默病(AD)、轻度认知障碍(MCI)和认知正常对照组的灰质体积，发现AD患者海马萎缩显著，海马体积对MCI向AD转化具有中等预测价值，但APOE4基因状态对海马体积无显著影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病和轻度认知障碍与进行性脑灰质损失相关，特别是在内侧颞叶结构。本研究旨在通过神经影像特征分析，深入了解AD进展的关键脑区变化、预测生物标志物和遗传因素的影响。

Method: 使用CAT12/SPM12体素形态测量分析249名ADNI参与者（认知正常90人、MCI 129人、AD 30人）的基线T1加权MRI扫描，采用一般线性模型分析灰质体积，以诊断组为主要预测因子，调整年龄和颅内总体积，使用p<0.001（体素水平）和FWE校正p<0.05（团块水平）进行统计。

Result: AD患者相对于认知正常组和MCI组海马萎缩显著（Cohen's d分别为2.03和1.61）；海马体积对MCI向AD转化具有中等预测价值（AUC=0.66）；按APOE4状态分层分析未发现遗传效应对海马体积的显著影响。

Conclusion: 这些结果支持内侧颞叶退化是AD进展的关键特征，为预测生物标志物和遗传影响提供了见解，但提示海马体积在预测MCI向AD转化方面的价值有限，且APOE4基因状态不影响海马萎缩模式。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are associated with progressive gray matter loss, particularly in medial temporal structures. In this study, CAT12/SPM12 voxel-based morphometry was applied to baseline T1-weighted MRI scans from 249 ADNI participants (CN = 90, MCI = 129, AD = 30). Gray matter volume was analyzed using a general linear model, with the diagnostic group as primary predictor and age and total intracranial volume as covariates. Statistical maps were thresholded at p < 0.001 (voxelwise) and corrected for multiple comparisons at the cluster level using family-wise error (FWE) correction (p < 0.05). Significant hippocampal atrophy was observed in AD relative to CN and MCI (Cohen's d = 2.03 and 1.61, respectively). Hippocampal volume demonstrated moderate predictive value for conversion from MCI to AD (AUC = 0.66). Stratification by APOE4 status did not reveal significant genetic effects on cross-sectional hippocampal volume. These results support medial temporal degeneration as a key feature of AD progression and provide insights into predictive biomarkers and genetic influences.

Abstract: Long videos, ranging from minutes to hours, present significant challenges for current Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) due to their complex events, diverse scenes, and long-range dependencies. Direct encoding of such videos is computationally too expensive, while simple video-to-text conversion often results in redundant or fragmented content. To address these limitations, we introduce MMViR, a novel multi-modal, multi-grained structured representation for long video understanding. MMViR identifies key turning points to segment the video and constructs a three-level description that couples global narratives with fine-grained visual details. This design supports efficient query-based retrieval and generalizes well across various scenarios. Extensive evaluations across three tasks, including QA, summarization, and retrieval, show that MMViR outperforms the prior strongest method, achieving a 19.67% improvement in hour-long video understanding while reducing processing latency to 45.4% of the original.

TL;DR: 提出一个基于Segment Anything Model（SAM）特征的多任务深度学习框架，联合进行乳腺超声图像中的病灶分割和诊断分类，在PRECISE 2025数据集上达到了0.887的DSC和92.3%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺超声（BUS）图像由于对比度低、斑点噪声和病灶形态多样，准确分割和分类肿瘤具有挑战性。本研究旨在利用SAM视觉编码器的预训练表示能力，通过多任务学习同时提高分割和分类性能。

Method: 开发了一个多任务深度学习框架：1）使用SAM视觉编码器提取高维特征；2）通过轻量卷积头或UNet型解码器进行像素级分割；3）采用掩模引导注意力增强分类分支，使模型聚焦病灶相关特征，抑制背景伪影。无需提示，完全监督。

Result: 在PRECISE 2025乳腺超声数据集（按类别80%训练/20%测试划分）上，该方法实现了0.887的Dice相似系数（DSC）和92.3%的分类准确率，在PRECISE挑战排行榜上名列前茅。

Conclusion: 研究证明，基于SAM的表示与分割引导学习相结合，能显著改善乳腺超声图像的病灶勾画和诊断预测，验证了多任务框架的有效性。

Abstract: Accurate tumor segmentation and classification in breast ultrasound (BUS) imaging remain challenging due to low contrast, speckle noise, and diverse lesion morphology. This study presents a multi-task deep learning framework that jointly performs lesion segmentation and diagnostic classification using embeddings from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) vision encoder. Unlike prompt-based SAM variants, our approach employs a prompt-free, fully supervised adaptation where high-dimensional SAM features are decoded through either a lightweight convolutional head or a UNet-inspired decoder for pixel-wise segmentation. The classification branch is enhanced via mask-guided attention, allowing the model to focus on lesion-relevant features while suppressing background artifacts. Experiments on the PRECISE 2025 breast ultrasound dataset, split per class into 80 percent training and 20 percent testing, show that the proposed method achieves a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.887 and an accuracy of 92.3 percent, ranking among the top entries on the PRECISE challenge leaderboard. These results demonstrate that SAM-based representations, when coupled with segmentation-guided learning, significantly improve both lesion delineation and diagnostic prediction in breast ultrasound imaging.

Abstract: Hieroglyphs, as logographic writing systems, encode rich semantic and cultural information within their internal structural composition. Yet, current advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) usually remain structurally blind to this information. LLMs process characters as textual tokens, while MLLMs additionally view them as raw pixel grids. Both fall short to model the underlying logic of character strokes. Furthermore, existing structural analysis methods are often script-specific and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose Hieroglyphic Stroke Analyzer (HieroSA), a novel and generalizable framework that enables MLLMs to automatically derive stroke-level structures from character bitmaps without handcrafted data. It transforms modern logographic and ancient hieroglyphs character images into explicit, interpretable line-segment representations in a normalized coordinate space, allowing for cross-lingual generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HieroSA effectively captures character-internal structures and semantics, bypassing the need for language-specific priors. Experimental results highlight the potential of our work as a graphematics analysis tool for a deeper understanding of hieroglyphic scripts. View our code at https://github.com/THUNLP-MT/HieroSA.

Motivation: 传统视频人脸交换方法局限于像素表示，生成的结果缺乏动画和交互操控能力

Method: 预处理目标视频提取FLAME参数、相机位姿和分割掩码；将3D高斯点云绑定到FLAME模型实现动态控制；使用复合身份嵌入进行精细化调整；最终将换脸化身渲染到背景帧

Result: 实验表明GaussianSwap在身份保持、视觉清晰度和时间一致性方面优越，并实现传统方法无法达到的交互应用

Conclusion: 该工作代表了从传统像素级视频生成到高质量换脸化身创建的范式转变

Abstract: We introduce GaussianSwap, a novel video face swapping framework that constructs a 3D Gaussian Splatting based face avatar from a target video while transferring identity from a source image to the avatar. Conventional video swapping frameworks are limited to generating facial representations in pixel-based formats. The resulting swapped faces exist merely as a set of unstructured pixels without any capacity for animation or interactive manipulation. Our work introduces a paradigm shift from conventional pixel-based video generation to the creation of high-fidelity avatar with swapped faces. The framework first preprocesses target video to extract FLAME parameters, camera poses and segmentation masks, and then rigs 3D Gaussian splats to the FLAME model across frames, enabling dynamic facial control. To ensure identity preserving, we propose an compound identity embedding constructed from three state-of-the-art face recognition models for avatar finetuning. Finally, we render the face-swapped avatar on the background frames to obtain the face-swapped video. Experimental results demonstrate that GaussianSwap achieves superior identity preservation, visual clarity and temporal consistency, while enabling previously unattainable interactive applications.

Abstract: Video-based Person Re-IDentification (VPReID) aims to retrieve the same person from videos captured by non-overlapping cameras. At extreme far distances, VPReID is highly challenging due to severe resolution degradation, drastic viewpoint variation and inevitable appearance noise. To address these issues, we propose a Scale-Adaptive framework with Shape Priors for VPReID, named SAS-VPReID. The framework is built upon three complementary modules. First, we deploy a Memory-Enhanced Visual Backbone (MEVB) to extract discriminative feature representations, which leverages the CLIP vision encoder and multi-proxy memory. Second, we propose a Multi-Granularity Temporal Modeling (MGTM) to construct sequences at multiple temporal granularities and adaptively emphasize motion cues across scales. Third, we incorporate Prior-Regularized Shape Dynamics (PRSD) to capture body structure dynamics. With these modules, our framework can obtain more discriminative feature representations. Experiments on the VReID-XFD benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of each module and our final framework ranks the first on the VReID-XFD challenge leaderboard.

Abstract: Multi-modal image fusion aims to integrate complementary information from multiple source images to produce high-quality fused images with enriched content. Although existing approaches based on state space model have achieved satisfied performance with high computational efficiency, they tend to either over-prioritize infrared intensity at the cost of visible details, or conversely, preserve visible structure while diminishing thermal target salience. To overcome these challenges, we propose DIFF-MF, a novel difference-driven channel-spatial state space model for multi-modal image fusion. Our approach leverages feature discrepancy maps between modalities to guide feature extraction, followed by a fusion process across both channel and spatial dimensions. In the channel dimension, a channel-exchange module enhances channel-wise interaction through cross-attention dual state space modeling, enabling adaptive feature reweighting. In the spatial dimension, a spatial-exchange module employs cross-modal state space scanning to achieve comprehensive spatial fusion. By efficiently capturing global dependencies while maintaining linear computational complexity, DIFF-MF effectively integrates complementary multi-modal features. Experimental results on the driving scenarios and low-altitude UAV datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in both visual quality and quantitative evaluation.

Abstract: Existing multi-object image generation methods face difficulties in achieving precise alignment between localized image generation regions and their corresponding semantics based on language descriptions, frequently resulting in inconsistent object quantities and attribute aliasing. To mitigate this limitation, mainstream approaches typically rely on external control signals to explicitly constrain the spatial layout, local semantic and visual attributes of images. However, this strong dependency makes the input format rigid, rendering it incompatible with the heterogeneous resource conditions of users and diverse constraint requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MoGen, a user-friendly multi-object image generation method. First, we design a Regional Semantic Anchor (RSA) module that precisely anchors phrase units in language descriptions to their corresponding image regions during the generation process, enabling text-to-image generation that follows quantity specifications for multiple objects. Building upon this foundation, we further introduce an Adaptive Multi-modal Guidance (AMG) module, which adaptively parses and integrates various combinations of multi-source control signals to formulate corresponding structured intent. This intent subsequently guides selective constraints on scene layouts and object attributes, achieving dynamic fine-grained control. Experimental results demonstrate that MoGen significantly outperforms existing methods in generation quality, quantity consistency, and fine-grained control, while exhibiting superior accessibility and control flexibility.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in multimodal tasks, but remain susceptible to hallucinations, where generated text deviates from the underlying visual content. Existing hallucination detection methods primarily rely on output logits or external verification tools, often overlooking their internal mechanisms. In this work, we investigate the outputs of internal attention heads, postulating that specific heads carry the primary signals for truthful generation.However, directly probing these high-dimensional states is challenging due to the entanglement of visual-linguistic syntax and noise. To address this, we propose VIB-Probe, a novel hallucination detection and mitigation framework leveraging the Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) theory. Our method extracts discriminative patterns across layers and heads while filtering out semantic nuisances through the information bottleneck principle. Furthermore, by leveraging the gradients of our VIB probe, we identify attention heads with strong causal influence on hallucinations and introduce an inference-time intervention strategy for hallucination mitigation. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that VIB-Probe significantly outperforms existing baselines in both settings. Our code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Universal visual anomaly detection (AD) aims to identify anomaly images and segment anomaly regions towards open and dynamic scenarios, following zero- and few-shot paradigms without any dataset-specific fine-tuning. We have witnessed significant progress in widely use of visual-language foundational models in recent approaches. However, current methods often struggle with complex prompt engineering, elaborate adaptation modules, and challenging training strategies, ultimately limiting their flexibility and generality. To address these issues, this paper rethinks the fundamental mechanism behind visual-language models for AD and presents an embarrassingly simple, general, and effective framework for Universal vision Anomaly Detection (UniADet). Specifically, we first find language encoder is used to derive decision weights for anomaly classification and segmentation, and then demonstrate that it is unnecessary for universal AD. Second, we propose an embarrassingly simple method to completely decouple classification and segmentation, and decouple cross-level features, i.e., learning independent weights for different tasks and hierarchical features. UniADet is highly simple (learning only decoupled weights), parameter-efficient (only 0.002M learnable parameters), general (adapting a variety of foundation models), and effective (surpassing state-of-the-art zero-/few-shot by a large margin and even full-shot AD methods for the first time) on 14 real-world AD benchmarks covering both industrial and medical domains. We will make the code and model of UniADet available at https://github.com/gaobb/UniADet.

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用了无标注数据，在半监督表情识别任务中表现出色，证明了所提策略的有效性

Abstract: Facial expression recognition is a key task in human-computer interaction and affective computing. However, acquiring a large amount of labeled facial expression data is often costly. Therefore, it is particularly important to design a semi-supervised facial expression recognition algorithm that makes full use of both labeled and unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised facial expression recognition algorithm based on Dynamic Threshold Adjustment (DTA) and Selective Negative Learning (SNL). Initially, we designed strategies for local attention enhancement and random dropout of feature maps during feature extraction, which strengthen the representation of local features while ensuring the model does not overfit to any specific local area. Furthermore, this study introduces a dynamic thresholding method to adapt to the requirements of the semi-supervised learning framework for facial expression recognition tasks, and through a selective negative learning strategy, it fully utilizes unlabeled samples with low confidence by mining useful expression information from complementary labels, achieving impressive results. We have achieved state-of-the-art performance on the RAF-DB and AffectNet datasets. Our method surpasses fully supervised methods even without using the entire dataset, which proves the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: 该研究针对社交媒体新闻摘要（图文搭配）引发读者理解偏差的问题，开发了MM-Misleading测试基准，并提出了OMGuard模型以提升多模态误导性内容检测与纠偏能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有社交媒体新闻摘要即使‘事实上正确’，也常因省略关键背景信息而诱导读者产生偏离原文的理解偏差。这种‘解释漂移’式隐性损害较显性错误信息更难察觉且研究不足。

Method: 研究者提出多阶段流程析构并模拟摘要式与完整语境式理解，并构建MM-Misleading基准。进而开发OMGuard，它整合（1）基于理解意识微调以提升误导检测能力和（2）基于推理引导的误导内容修正策略——以显式推理指导标题改写以减少误导印象。

Result: 实验表明，OMGuard仅用8B参数模型即可达到235B大模型的检测准确率，且在端到端纠偏任务上表现显著更优。进一步分析显示，误导性多源自局部叙事省略（如缺失背景）而非整体框架变更，同时识别出需视觉干预的纯文本修正失效场景。

Conclusion: 该工作揭示了多模态新闻摘要中隐性误导的危害性，提出的方法在检测与纠正效果上展现强劲性能，强调了对‘选择性省略’式误导进行系统性研究及跨模态矫正的必要性。

Abstract: Even when factually correct, social-media news previews (image-headline pairs) can induce interpretation drift: by selectively omitting crucial context, they lead readers to form judgments that diverge from what the full article conveys. This covert harm is harder to detect than explicit misinformation yet remains underexplored. To address this gap, we develop a multi-stage pipeline that disentangles and simulates preview-based versus context-based understanding, enabling construction of the MM-Misleading benchmark. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate open-source LVLMs and uncover pronounced blind spots to omission-based misleadingness detection. We further propose OMGuard, which integrates (1) Interpretation-Aware Fine-Tuning, which used to improve multimodal misleadingness detection and (2) Rationale-Guided Misleading Content Correction, which uses explicit rationales to guide headline rewriting and reduce misleading impressions. Experiments show that OMGuard lifts an 8B model's detection accuracy to match a 235B LVLM and delivers markedly stronger end-to-end correction. Further analysis reveals that misleadingness typically stems from local narrative shifts (e.g., missing background) rather than global frame changes, and identifies image-driven scenarios where text-only correction fails, highlighting the necessity of visual interventions.

Abstract: Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) integrate multimodal understanding and generation, yet they are limited to maintaining visual consistency and disambiguating visual cues when referencing details across multiple input images. In this work, we propose a scalable multi-image editing framework for UMMs that explicitly distinguishes image identities and generalizes to variable input counts. Algorithmically, we introduce two innovations: 1) The learnable latent separators explicitly differentiate each reference image in the latent space, enabling accurate and disentangled conditioning. 2) The sinusoidal index encoding assigns visual tokens from the same image a continuous sinusoidal index embedding, which provides explicit image identity while allowing generalization and extrapolation on a variable number of inputs. To facilitate training and evaluation, we establish a high-fidelity benchmark using an inverse dataset construction methodology to guarantee artifact-free, achievable outputs. Experiments show clear improvements in semantic consistency, visual fidelity, and cross-image integration over prior baselines on diverse multi-image editing tasks, validating our advantages on consistency and generalization ability.

Abstract: This work presents Orient Anything V2, an enhanced foundation model for unified understanding of object 3D orientation and rotation from single or paired images. Building upon Orient Anything V1, which defines orientation via a single unique front face, V2 extends this capability to handle objects with diverse rotational symmetries and directly estimate relative rotations. These improvements are enabled by four key innovations: 1) Scalable 3D assets synthesized by generative models, ensuring broad category coverage and balanced data distribution; 2) An efficient, model-in-the-loop annotation system that robustly identifies 0 to N valid front faces for each object; 3) A symmetry-aware, periodic distribution fitting objective that captures all plausible front-facing orientations, effectively modeling object rotational symmetry; 4) A multi-frame architecture that directly predicts relative object rotations. Extensive experiments show that Orient Anything V2 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on orientation estimation, 6DoF pose estimation, and object symmetry recognition across 11 widely used benchmarks. The model demonstrates strong generalization, significantly broadening the applicability of orientation estimation in diverse downstream tasks.

Abstract: The malicious misuse and widespread dissemination of AI-generated images pose a significant threat to the authenticity of online information. Current detection methods often struggle to generalize to unseen generative models, and the rapid evolution of generative techniques continuously exacerbates this challenge. Without adaptability, detection models risk becoming ineffective in real-world applications. To address this critical issue, we propose a novel three-stage domain continual learning framework designed for continuous adaptation to evolving generative models. In the first stage, we employ a strategic parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach to develop a transferable offline detection model with strong generalization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, the second stage integrates unseen data streams into a continual learning process. To efficiently learn from limited samples of novel generated models and mitigate overfitting, we design a data augmentation chain with progressively increasing complexity. Furthermore, we leverage the Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC) method to approximate the Hessian and alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Finally, the third stage utilizes a linear interpolation strategy based on Linear Mode Connectivity, effectively capturing commonalities across diverse generative models and further enhancing overall performance. We establish a comprehensive benchmark of 27 generative models, including GANs, deepfakes, and diffusion models, chronologically structured up to August 2024 to simulate real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our initial offline detectors surpass the leading baseline by +5.51% in terms of mean average precision. Our continual learning strategy achieves an average accuracy of 92.20%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: In the field of 3D dynamic scene reconstruction, how to balance model convergence rate and rendering quality has long been a critical challenge that urgently needs to be addressed, particularly in high-precision modeling of scenes with complex dynamic motions. To tackle this issue, this study proposes the GS-DMSR method. By quantitatively analyzing the dynamic evolution process of Gaussian attributes, this mechanism achieves adaptive gradient focusing, enabling it to dynamically identify significant differences in the motion states of Gaussian models. It then applies differentiated optimization strategies to Gaussian models with varying degrees of significance, thereby significantly improving the model convergence rate. Additionally, this research integrates a multi-scale manifold enhancement module, which leverages the collaborative optimization of an implicit nonlinear decoder and an explicit deformation field to enhance the modeling efficiency for complex deformation scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that this method achieves a frame rate of up to 96 FPS on synthetic datasets, while effectively reducing both storage overhead and training time.Our code and data are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GS-DMSR-2212.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models often struggle with faithful reasoning in complex visual scenes, where intricate entities and relations require precise visual grounding at each step. This reasoning unfaithfulness frequently manifests as hallucinated entities, mis-grounded relations, skipped steps, and over-specified reasoning. Existing preference-based approaches, typically relying on textual perturbations or answer-conditioned rationales, fail to address this challenge as they allow models to exploit language priors to bypass visual grounding. To address this, we propose SceneAlign, a framework that leverages scene graphs as structured visual information to perform controllable structural interventions. By identifying reasoning-critical nodes and perturbing them through four targeted strategies that mimic typical grounding failures, SceneAlign constructs hard negative rationales that remain linguistically plausible but are grounded in inaccurate visual facts. These contrastive pairs are used in Direct Preference Optimization to steer models toward fine-grained, structure-faithful reasoning. Across seven visual reasoning benchmarks, SceneAlign consistently improves answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, highlighting the effectiveness of grounding-aware alignment for multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: The goal of gait recognition is to extract identity-invariant features of an individual under various gait conditions, e.g., cross-view and cross-clothing. Most gait models strive to implicitly learn the common traits across different gait conditions in a data-driven manner to pull different gait conditions closer for recognition. However, relatively few studies have explicitly explored the inherent relations between different gait conditions. For this purpose, we attempt to establish connections among different gait conditions and propose a new perspective to achieve gait recognition: variations in different gait conditions can be approximately viewed as a combination of geometric transformations. In this case, all we need is to determine the types of geometric transformations and achieve geometric invariance, then identity invariance naturally follows. As an initial attempt, we explore three common geometric transformations (i.e., Reflect, Rotate, and Scale) and design a $\mathcal{R}$eflect-$\mathcal{R}$otate-$\mathcal{S}$cale invariance learning framework, named ${\mathcal{RRS}}$-Gait. Specifically, it first flexibly adjusts the convolution kernel based on the specific geometric transformations to achieve approximate feature equivariance. Then these three equivariant-aware features are respectively fed into a global pooling operation for final invariance-aware learning. Extensive experiments on four popular gait datasets (Gait3D, GREW, CCPG, SUSTech1K) show superior performance across various gait conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图表作为视觉信息的高密度载体，其复杂的数据结构和精准的推理要求对现有的多模态大语言模型构成了显著挑战。许多基于强化学习训练的MLLM在信用分配上面临困难，即仅能在轨迹级别进行优势估计，无法区分单个生成响应中的正确与错误推理步骤。为了应对这一局限，作者提出了一种新的MLLM，以实现对推理过程的细粒度优化。

Method: 研究者提出了SketchVL模型，其核心方法是在图像上绘制中间推理步骤的标记（markers）并将带标记的图像反馈给模型自身，从而构建一个鲁棒的多步推理流程。模型使用FinePO算法进行强化学习优化，该算法利用细粒度过程奖励模型（FinePRM）对轨迹中的每个绘图动作进行评分，精确地将信用分配给每个推理步骤。这使得FinePO能够在轨迹整体成功时更强地奖励正确的token，而在轨迹全局次优时更严厉地惩罚错误的token，从而获得细粒度的强化信号。

Result: 实验结果表明，SketchVL能够将其步骤级别的行为与FinePRM奖励模型对齐，在图表数据集、自然图像数据集和数学任务上相比其基准模型取得了平均7.23%的性能提升，这为训练强大的推理模型提供了一个有前景的新方向。

Conclusion: SketchVL通过引入基于绘图的中间推理和FinePO算法的精细化信用分配机制，成功解决了多模态大语言模型在复杂视觉推理（尤其是图表理解）中面临的细粒度信用分配难题。该方法不仅显著提升了模型在目标任务上的性能，也为未来开发更强大的推理模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Charts are high-density visual carriers of complex data and medium for information extraction and analysis. Due to the need for precise and complex visual reasoning, automated chart understanding poses a significant challenge to existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Many MLLMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) face the challenge of credit assignment. Their advantage estimation, typically performed at the trajectory level, cannot distinguish between correct and incorrect reasoning steps within a single generated response. To address this limitation, we introduce SketchVL, a novel MLLM that optimized with FinePO, a new RL algorithm designed for fine-grained credit assignment within each trajectory. SketchVL's methodology involves drawing its intermediate reasoning steps as markers on the image and feeding the annotated image back to itself, creating a robust, multi-step reasoning process. During training, the FinePO algorithm leverages a Fine-grained Process Reward Model (FinePRM) to score each drawing action within a trajectory, thereby precisely assigning credit for each step. This mechanism allows FinePO to more strongly reward correct tokens when a trajectory is globally successful, and more heavily penalize incorrect tokens when the trajectory is globally suboptimal, thus achieving fine-grained reinforcement signals. Experiments show that SketchVL learns to align its step-level behavior with the FinePRM, achieving an average performance gain of 7.23\% over its base model across chart datasets, natural image datasets, and mathematics, providing a promising new direction for training powerful reasoning models.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that RCM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both novel view synthesis and 3D generation quality.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of integrating Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into flow matching models, particularly for text-to-image and text-to-video generation. However, we find that directly applying these techniques to image-to-video (I2V) models often fails to yield consistent reward improvements. To address this limitation, we present TAGRPO, a robust post-training framework for I2V models inspired by contrastive learning. Our approach is grounded in the observation that rollout videos generated from identical initial noise provide superior guidance for optimization. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel GRPO loss applied to intermediate latents, encouraging direct alignment with high-reward trajectories while maximizing distance from low-reward counterparts. Furthermore, we introduce a memory bank for rollout videos to enhance diversity and reduce computational overhead. Despite its simplicity, TAGRPO achieves significant improvements over DanceGRPO in I2V generation.

This yields strong semantics, going beyond basic RGB-D input, aiding both tracking and mapping accuracy. Unlike previous semantic SLAM approaches (which embed pre-defined class labels) FeatureSLAM enables entirely new downstream tasks via free-viewpoint, open-set segmentation. Across standard benchmarks, our method achieves real-time tracking, on par with state-of-the-art systems while improving tracking stability and map fidelity without prohibitive compute. Quantitatively, we obtain 9\% lower pose error and 8\% higher mapping accuracy compared to recent fixed-set SLAM baselines. Our results confirm that real-time feature-embedded SLAM, is not only valuable for enabling new downstream applications. It also improves the performance of the underlying tracking and mapping subsystems, providing semantic and language masking results that are on-par with offline 3DGS models, alongside state-of-the-art tracking, depth and RGB rendering.

Abstract: Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) is essential for reliable face recognition systems. Current approaches primarily exploit only final-layer representations, while training-free methods require multiple forward passes or backpropagation. We propose ViTNT-FIQA, a training-free approach that measures the stability of patch embedding evolution across intermediate Vision Transformer (ViT) blocks. We demonstrate that high-quality face images exhibit stable feature refinement trajectories across blocks, while degraded images show erratic transformations. Our method computes Euclidean distances between L2-normalized patch embeddings from consecutive transformer blocks and aggregates them into image-level quality scores. We empirically validate this correlation on a quality-labeled synthetic dataset with controlled degradation levels. Unlike existing training-free approaches, ViTNT-FIQA requires only a single forward pass without backpropagation or architectural modifications. Through extensive evaluation on eight benchmarks (LFW, AgeDB-30, CFP-FP, CALFW, Adience, CPLFW, XQLFW, IJB-C), we show that ViTNT-FIQA achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while maintaining computational efficiency and immediate applicability to any pre-trained ViT-based face recognition model.

Conclusion: FlyPose 在无人机视角的低分辨率、遮挡等挑战下，能够高效、实时地进行人体姿态估计，并开源了难度较高的无人机视角姿态估计数据集 FlyPose-104

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in close proximity to humans for applications such as parcel delivery, traffic monitoring, disaster response and infrastructure inspections. Ensuring safe and reliable operation in these human-populated environments demands accurate perception of human poses and actions from an aerial viewpoint. This perspective challenges existing methods with low resolution, steep viewing angles and (self-)occlusion, especially if the application demands realtime feasibile models. We train and deploy FlyPose, a lightweight top-down human pose estimation pipeline for aerial imagery. Through multi-dataset training, we achieve an average improvement of 6.8 mAP in person detection across the test-sets of Manipal-UAV, VisDrone, HIT-UAV as well as our custom dataset. For 2D human pose estimation we report an improvement of 16.3 mAP on the challenging UAV-Human dataset. FlyPose runs with an inference latency of ~20 milliseconds including preprocessing on a Jetson Orin AGX Developer Kit and is deployed onboard a quadrotor UAV during flight experiments. We also publish FlyPose-104, a small but challenging aerial human pose estimation dataset, that includes manual annotations from difficult aerial perspectives: https://github.com/farooqhassaan/FlyPose.

Abstract: The ability to automatically generate large-scale, interactive, and physically realistic 3D environments is crucial for advancing robotic learning and embodied intelligence. However, existing generative approaches often fail to capture the functional complexity of real-world interiors, particularly those containing articulated objects with movable parts essential for manipulation and navigation. This paper presents SceneFoundry, a language-guided diffusion framework that generates apartment-scale 3D worlds with functionally articulated furniture and semantically diverse layouts for robotic training. From natural language prompts, an LLM module controls floor layout generation, while diffusion-based posterior sampling efficiently populates the scene with articulated assets from large-scale 3D repositories. To ensure physical usability, SceneFoundry employs differentiable guidance functions to regulate object quantity, prevent articulation collisions, and maintain sufficient walkable space for robotic navigation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework generates structurally valid, semantically coherent, and functionally interactive environments across diverse scene types and conditions, enabling scalable embodied AI research.

Abstract: Accurate surround-view depth estimation provides a competitive alternative to laser-based sensors and is essential for 3D scene understanding in autonomous driving. While prior studies have proposed various approaches that primarily focus on enforcing cross-view constraints at the photometric level, few explicitly exploit the rich geometric structure inherent in both monocular and surround-view setting. In this work, we propose GeoSurDepth, a framework that leverages geometry consistency as the primary cue for surround-view depth estimation. Concretely, we utilize foundation models as a pseudo geometry prior and feature representation enhancement tool to guide the network to maintain surface normal consistency in spatial 3D space and regularize object- and texture-consistent depth estimation in 2D. In addition, we introduce a novel view synthesis pipeline where 2D-3D lifting is achieved with dense depth reconstructed via spatial warping, encouraging additional photometric supervision across temporal, spatial, and spatial-temporal contexts, and compensating for the limitations of single-view image reconstruction. Finally, a newly-proposed adaptive joint motion learning strategy enables the network to adaptively emphasize informative spatial geometry cues for improved motion reasoning. Extensive experiments on DDAD and nuScenes demonstrate that GeoSurDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Our framework highlights the importance of exploiting geometry coherence and consistency for robust self-supervised multi-view depth estimation.

Method: 引入Goal Force框架，让用户通过明确的力向量和中间动态定义目标。使用合成因果原语数据集训练视频生成模型，教授模型理解力在时空中的传播

Result: 模型在简单物理数据上训练，却能零样本泛化到复杂真实场景，包括工具操纵和多物体因果链。模型表现出隐式神经物理模拟器的能力

Conclusion: 通过将视频生成建立在基本物理相互作用基础上，模型可以作为隐式物理模拟器，实现精确、物理感知的规划，无需依赖外部引擎

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have enabled the development of ``world models'' capable of simulating potential futures for robotics and planning. However, specifying precise goals for these models remains a challenge; text instructions are often too abstract to capture physical nuances, while target images are frequently infeasible to specify for dynamic tasks. To address this, we introduce Goal Force, a novel framework that allows users to define goals via explicit force vectors and intermediate dynamics, mirroring how humans conceptualize physical tasks. We train a video generation model on a curated dataset of synthetic causal primitives-such as elastic collisions and falling dominos-teaching it to propagate forces through time and space. Despite being trained on simple physics data, our model exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to complex, real-world scenarios, including tool manipulation and multi-object causal chains. Our results suggest that by grounding video generation in fundamental physical interactions, models can emerge as implicit neural physics simulators, enabling precise, physics-aware planning without reliance on external engines. We release all datasets, code, model weights, and interactive video demos at our project page.

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel latent diffusion-based pipeline for 3D kidney anomaly detection on contrast-enhanced abdominal CT. The method combines Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIMs), and Vector-Quantized Generative Adversarial Networks (VQ-GANs). Unlike prior slice-wise approaches, our method operates directly on an image volume and leverages weak supervision with only case-level pseudo-labels. We benchmark our approach against state-of-the-art supervised segmentation and detection models. This study demonstrates the feasibility and promise of 3D latent diffusion for weakly supervised anomaly detection. While the current results do not yet match supervised baselines, they reveal key directions for improving reconstruction fidelity and lesion localization. Our findings provide an important step toward annotation-efficient, generative modeling of complex abdominal anatomy.

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for decomposing arbitrarily posed humans into animatable multi-layered 3D human avatars, separating the body and garments. Conventional single-layer reconstruction methods lock clothing to one identity, while prior multi-layer approaches struggle with occluded regions. We overcome both limitations by encoding each layer as a set of 2D Gaussians for accurate geometry and photorealistic rendering, and inpainting hidden regions with a pretrained 2D diffusion model via score-distillation sampling (SDS). Our three-stage training strategy first reconstructs the coarse canonical garment via single-layer reconstruction, followed by multi-layer training to jointly recover the inner-layer body and outer-layer garment details. Experiments on two 3D human benchmark datasets (4D-Dress, Thuman2.0) show that our approach achieves better rendering quality and layer decomposition and recomposition than the previous state-of-the-art, enabling realistic virtual try-on under novel viewpoints and poses, and advancing practical creation of high-fidelity 3D human assets for immersive applications.

Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation is an effective method for addressing scenarios with limited labeled data. Existing methods mainly rely on frameworks such as mean teacher and dual-stream consistency learning. These approaches often face issues like error accumulation and model structural complexity, while also neglecting the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data streams. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Bidirectional Channel-selective Semantic Interaction~(BCSI) framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. First, we propose a Semantic-Spatial Perturbation~(SSP) mechanism, which disturbs the data using two strong augmentation operations and leverages unsupervised learning with pseudo-labels from weak augmentations. Additionally, we employ consistency on the predictions from the two strong augmentations to further improve model stability and robustness. Second, to reduce noise during the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data, we propose a Channel-selective Router~(CR) component, which dynamically selects the most relevant channels for information exchange. This mechanism ensures that only highly relevant features are activated, minimizing unnecessary interference. Finally, the Bidirectional Channel-wise Interaction~(BCI) strategy is employed to supplement additional semantic information and enhance the representation of important channels. Experimental results on multiple benchmarking 3D medical datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing semi-supervised approaches.

Abstract: Recent deepfake detection methods have increasingly explored frequency domain representations to reveal manipulation artifacts that are difficult to detect in the spatial domain. However, most existing approaches rely primarily on spectral magnitude, implicitly under exploring the role of phase information. In this work, we propose Phase4DFD, a phase aware frequency domain deepfake detection framework that explicitly models phase magnitude interactions via a learnable attention mechanism. Our approach augments standard RGB input with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) magnitude and local binary pattern (LBP) representations to expose subtle synthesis artifacts that remain indistinguishable under spatial analysis alone. Crucially, we introduce an input level phase aware attention module that uses phase discontinuities commonly introduced by synthetic generation to guide the model toward frequency patterns that are most indicative of manipulation before backbone feature extraction. The attended multi domain representation is processed by an efficient BNext M backbone, with optional channel spatial attention applied for semantic feature refinement. Extensive experiments on the CIFAKE and DFFD datasets demonstrate that our proposed model Phase4DFD outperforms state of the art spatial and frequency-based detectors while maintaining low computational overhead. Comprehensive ablation studies further confirm that explicit phase modeling provides complementary and non-redundant information beyond magnitude-only frequency representations.

Abstract: Current approaches for segmenting ultra high resolution images either slide a window, thereby discarding global context, or downsample and lose fine detail. We propose a simple yet effective method that brings explicit multi scale reasoning to vision transformers, simultaneously preserving local details and global awareness. Concretely, we process each image in parallel at a local scale (high resolution, small crops) and a global scale (low resolution, large crops), and aggregate and propagate features between the two branches with a small set of learnable relay tokens. The design plugs directly into standard transformer backbones (eg ViT and Swin) and adds fewer than 2 % parameters. Extensive experiments on three ultra high resolution segmentation benchmarks, Archaeoscape, URUR, and Gleason, and on the conventional Cityscapes dataset show consistent gains, with up to 15 % relative mIoU improvement. Code and pretrained models are available at https://archaeoscape.ai/work/relay-tokens/ .

Abstract: Hallucinations, generating responses inconsistent with the visual input, remain a critical limitation of large vision-language models (LVLMs), especially in open-ended tasks such as image captioning and visual reasoning. In this work, we probe the layer-wise generation dynamics that drive hallucinations and propose a training-free mitigation strategy. Employing the Logit Lens, we examine how LVLMs construct next-token distributions across decoder layers, uncovering a pronounced commitment-depth gap: truthful tokens accumulate probability mass on their final candidates earlier than hallucinatory ones. Drawing on this discovery, we introduce Context Embedding Injection (CEI), a lightweight method that harnesses the hidden state of the last input token-the context embedding-as a grounding signal to maintain visual fidelity throughout decoding and curb hallucinations. Evaluated on the CHAIR, AMBER, and MMHal-Bench benchmarks (with a maximum token length of 512), CEI outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across three LVLMs, with its dynamic variant yielding the lowest overall hallucination rates. By integrating novel mechanistic insights with a scalable intervention, this work advances the mitigation of hallucinations in LVLMs.

Abstract: Domain-generalized retinal vessel segmentation is critical for automated ophthalmic diagnosis, yet faces significant challenges from domain shift induced by non-uniform illumination and varying contrast, compounded by the difficulty of preserving fine vessel structures. While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibits remarkable zero-shot capabilities, existing SAM-based methods rely on simple adapter fine-tuning while overlooking frequency-domain information that encodes domain-invariant features, resulting in degraded generalization under illumination and contrast variations. Furthermore, SAM's direct upsampling inevitably loses fine vessel details. To address these limitations, we propose WaveRNet, a wavelet-guided frequency learning framework for robust multi-source domain-generalized retinal vessel segmentation. Specifically, we devise a Spectral-guided Domain Modulator (SDM) that integrates wavelet decomposition with learnable domain tokens, enabling the separation of illumination-robust low-frequency structures from high-frequency vessel boundaries while facilitating domain-specific feature generation. Furthermore, we introduce a Frequency-Adaptive Domain Fusion (FADF) module that performs intelligent test-time domain selection through wavelet-based frequency similarity and soft-weighted fusion. Finally, we present a Hierarchical Mask-Prompt Refiner (HMPR) that overcomes SAM's upsampling limitation through coarse-to-fine refinement with long-range dependency modeling. Extensive experiments under the Leave-One-Domain-Out protocol on four public retinal datasets demonstrate that WaveRNet achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have been dominated by diffusion and flow-matching models, which produce high-quality results but remain computationally intensive and difficult to scale. In this work, we introduce VideoAR, the first large-scale Visual Autoregressive (VAR) framework for video generation that combines multi-scale next-frame prediction with autoregressive modeling. VideoAR disentangles spatial and temporal dependencies by integrating intra-frame VAR modeling with causal next-frame prediction, supported by a 3D multi-scale tokenizer that efficiently encodes spatio-temporal dynamics. To improve long-term consistency, we propose Multi-scale Temporal RoPE, Cross-Frame Error Correction, and Random Frame Mask, which collectively mitigate error propagation and stabilize temporal coherence. Our multi-stage pretraining pipeline progressively aligns spatial and temporal learning across increasing resolutions and durations. Empirically, VideoAR achieves new state-of-the-art results among autoregressive models, improving FVD on UCF-101 from 99.5 to 88.6 while reducing inference steps by over 10x, and reaching a VBench score of 81.74-competitive with diffusion-based models an order of magnitude larger. These results demonstrate that VideoAR narrows the performance gap between autoregressive and diffusion paradigms, offering a scalable, efficient, and temporally consistent foundation for future video generation research.

Abstract: Inland water monitoring is vital for safeguarding public health and ecosystems, enabling timely interventions to mitigate risks. Existing methods often address isolated sub-problems such as cyanobacteria, chlorophyll, or other quality indicators separately. NAIAD introduces an agentic AI assistant that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and external analytical tools to deliver a holistic solution for inland water monitoring using Earth Observation (EO) data. Designed for both experts and non-experts, NAIAD provides a single-prompt interface that translates natural-language queries into actionable insights. Through Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LLM reasoning, external tool orchestration, computational graph execution, and agentic reflection, it retrieves and synthesizes knowledge from curated sources to produce tailored reports. The system integrates diverse tools for weather data, Sentinel-2 imagery, remote-sensing index computation (e.g., NDCI), chlorophyll-a estimation, and established platforms such as CyFi. Performance is evaluated using correctness and relevancy metrics, achieving over 77% and 85% respectively on a dedicated benchmark covering multiple user-expertise levels. Preliminary results show strong adaptability and robustness across query types. An ablation study on LLM backbones further highlights Gemma 3 (27B) and Qwen 2.5 (14B) as offering the best balance between computational efficiency and reasoning performance.

Abstract: Additive manufacturing (AM) relies critically on understanding and extrapolating process-property relationships; however, existing data-driven approaches remain limited by fragmented knowledge representations and unreliable extrapolation under sparse data conditions. In this study, we propose an ontology-guided, equation-centric framework that tightly integrates large language models (LLMs) with an additive manufacturing mathematical knowledge graph (AM-MKG) to enable reliable knowledge extraction and principled extrapolative modeling. By explicitly encoding equations, variables, assumptions, and their semantic relationships within a formal ontology, unstructured literature is transformed into machine-interpretable representations that support structured querying and reasoning. LLM-based equation generation is further conditioned on MKG-derived subgraphs, enforcing physically meaningful functional forms and mitigating non-physical or unstable extrapolation trends. To assess reliability beyond conventional predictive uncertainty, a confidence-aware extrapolation assessment is introduced, integrating extrapolation distance, statistical stability, and knowledge-graph-based physical consistency into a unified confidence score. Results demonstrate that ontology-guided extraction significantly improves the structural coherence and quantitative reliability of extracted knowledge, while subgraph-conditioned equation generation yields stable and physically consistent extrapolations compared to unguided LLM outputs. Overall, this work establishes a unified pipeline for ontology-driven knowledge representation, equation-centered reasoning, and confidence-based extrapolation assessment, highlighting the potential of knowledge-graph-augmented LLMs as reliable tools for extrapolative modeling in additive manufacturing.

TL;DR: 本文通过重复囚徒困境游戏研究了人格设定对LLM智能体合作行为的影响，发现友善度是促进合作的主要因素，人格设定更多表现为行为偏差而非确定性控制机制。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型越来越被用作战略和社会互动中的自主智能体，虽然有研究表明为LLM赋予人格特质能影响其行为，但人格设定在受控条件下如何影响合作行为仍不清楚。

Method: 基于大五人格框架，首先测量三个模型(GPT-3.5-turbo、GPT-4o、GPT-5)的基础人格剖面，然后在基准条件和人格信息条件下比较行为，并分析单独操纵各人格维度到极端值的影响。

Result: 结果显示友善度是所有模型中促进合作的主导因素，其他人格特质影响有限；明确的人格信息能增加合作，但也增加被利用的脆弱性，特别是在早期模型中；后期模型表现出更选择性的合作。

Conclusion: 人格设定更多是作为行为偏差而非确定性控制机制，对LLM智能体的合作行为产生复杂影响。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as autonomous agents in strategic and social interactions. Although recent studies suggest that assigning personality traits to LLMs can influence their behavior, how personality steering affects cooperation under controlled conditions remains unclear. In this study, we examine the effects of personality steering on cooperative behavior in LLM agents using repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games. Based on the Big Five framework, we first measure basic personality profiles of three models, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, and GPT-5, using the Big Five Inventory. We then compare behavior under baseline and personality-informed conditions, and further analyze the effects of independently manipulating each personality dimension to extreme values. Our results show that agreeableness is the dominant factor promoting cooperation across all models, while other personality traits have limited impact. Explicit personality information increases cooperation but can also raise vulnerability to exploitation, particularly in earlier-generation models. In contrast, later-generation models exhibit more selective cooperation. These findings indicate that personality steering acts as a behavioral bias rather than a deterministic control mechanism.

Abstract: Predicting enzyme-substrate interactions has long been a fundamental problem in biochemistry and metabolic engineering. While existing methods could leverage databases of expert-curated enzyme-substrate pairs for models to learn from known pair interactions, the databases are often sparse, i.e., there are only limited and incomplete examples of such pairs, and also labor-intensive to maintain. This lack of sufficient training data significantly hinders the ability of traditional enzyme prediction models to generalize to unseen interactions. In this work, we try to exploit chemical reaction equations from domain-specific databases, given their easier accessibility and denser, more abundant data. However, interactions of multiple compounds, e.g., educts and products, with the same enzymes create complex relational data patterns that traditional models cannot easily capture. To tackle that, we represent chemical reaction equations as triples of (educt, enzyme, product) within a knowledge graph, such that we can take advantage of knowledge graph embedding (KGE) to infer missing enzyme-substrate pairs for graph completion. Particularly, in order to capture intricate relationships among compounds, we propose our knowledge-enhanced hypergraph model for enzyme prediction, i.e., Hyper-Enz, which integrates a hypergraph transformer with a KGE model to learn representations of the hyper-edges that involve multiple educts and products. Also, a multi-expert paradigm is introduced to guide the learning of enzyme-substrate interactions with both the proposed model and chemical reaction equations. Experimental results show a significant improvement, with up to a 88% relative improvement in average enzyme retrieval accuracy and 30% improvement in pair-level prediction compared to traditional models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Persona conditioning can be viewed as a behavioral prior for large language models (LLMs) and is often assumed to confer expertise and improve safety in a monotonic manner. However, its effects on high-stakes clinical decision-making remain poorly characterized. We systematically evaluate persona-based control in clinical LLMs, examining how professional roles (e.g., Emergency Department physician, nurse) and interaction styles (bold vs.\ cautious) influence behavior across models and medical tasks. We assess performance on clinical triage and patient-safety tasks using multidimensional evaluations that capture task accuracy, calibration, and safety-relevant risk behavior. We find systematic, context-dependent, and non-monotonic effects: Medical personas improve performance in critical care tasks, yielding gains of up to $\sim+20\%$ in accuracy and calibration, but degrade performance in primary-care settings by comparable margins. Interaction style modulates risk propensity and sensitivity, but it's highly model-dependent. While aggregated LLM-judge rankings favor medical over non-medical personas in safety-critical cases, we found that human clinicians show moderate agreement on safety compliance (average Cohen's $κ= 0.43$) but indicate a low confidence in 95.9\% of their responses on reasoning quality. Our work shows that personas function as behavioral priors that introduce context-dependent trade-offs rather than guarantees of safety or expertise.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful candidates for complex decision-making, leveraging vast encoded knowledge and remarkable zero-shot abilities. However, their adoption in high-stakes environments is hindered by their opacity; their outputs lack faithful explanations and cannot be effectively contested to correct errors, undermining trustworthiness. In this paper, we propose ART (Adaptive Reasoning Trees), a hierarchical method for claim verification. The process begins with a root claim, which branches into supporting and attacking child arguments. An argument's strength is determined bottom-up via a pairwise tournament of its children, adjudicated by a judge LLM, allowing a final, transparent and contestable verdict to be systematically derived which is missing in methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). We empirically validate ART on multiple datasets, analyzing different argument generators and comparison strategies. Our findings show that ART's structured reasoning outperforms strong baselines, establishing a new benchmark for explainable claim verification which is more reliable and ensures clarity in the overall decision making step.

Conclusion: MMUEChange框架具备处理复杂城市变化分析的能力，其多模态整合方法和实际案例应用展示了在城市环境监测和政策制定中的实用价值。

Abstract: Understanding urban environment change is essential for sustainable development. However, current approaches, particularly remote sensing change detection, often rely on rigid, single-modal analysis. To overcome these limitations, we propose MMUEChange, a multi-modal agent framework that flexibly integrates heterogeneous urban data via a modular toolkit and a core module, Modality Controller for cross- and intra-modal alignment, enabling robust analysis of complex urban change scenarios. Case studies include: a shift toward small, community-focused parks in New York, reflecting local green space efforts; the spread of concentrated water pollution across districts in Hong Kong, pointing to coordinated water management; and a notable decline in open dumpsites in Shenzhen, with contrasting links between nighttime economic activity and waste types, indicating differing urban pressures behind domestic and construction waste. Compared to the best-performing baseline, the MMUEChange agent achieves a 46.7% improvement in task success rate and effectively mitigates hallucination, demonstrating its capacity to support complex urban change analysis tasks with real-world policy implications.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Benchmarking the relative capabilities of AI systems, including Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Models, typically ignores the impact of uncertainty in the underlying ground truth answers from experts. This ambiguity is particularly consequential in medicine where uncertainty is pervasive. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic paradigm to theoretically explain how high certainty in ground truth answers is almost always necessary for even an expert to achieve high scores, whereas in datasets with high variation in ground truth answers there may be little difference between a random labeller and an expert. Therefore, ignoring uncertainty in ground truth evaluation data can result in the misleading conclusion that a non-expert has similar performance to that of an expert. Using the probabilistic paradigm, we thus bring forth the concepts of expected accuracy and expected F1 to estimate the score an expert human or system can achieve given ground truth answer variability.
  Our work leads to the recommendation that when establishing the capability of a system, results should be stratified by probability of the ground truth answer, typically measured by the agreement rate of ground truth experts. Stratification becomes critical when the overall performance drops below a threshold of 80%. Under stratified evaluation, performance comparison becomes more reliable in high certainty bins, mitigating the effect of the key confounding factor -- uncertainty.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence now outperforms humans in several scientific and engineering tasks, yet its internal representations often remain opaque. In this Perspective, we argue that explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), combined with causal reasoning, enables {\it learning from the learners}. Focusing on discovery, optimization and certification, we show how the combination of foundation models and explainability methods allows the extraction of causal mechanisms, guides robust design and control, and supports trust and accountability in high-stakes applications. We discuss challenges in faithfulness, generalization and usability of explanations, and propose XAI as a unifying framework for human-AI collaboration in science and engineering.

Abstract: One mistake by an AI system in a safety-critical setting can cost lives. As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to robotics decision-making, the physical dimension of risk grows; a single wrong instruction can directly endanger human safety. This paper addresses the urgent need to systematically evaluate LLM performance in scenarios where even minor errors are catastrophic. Through a qualitative evaluation of a fire evacuation scenario, we identified critical failure cases in LLM-based decision-making. Based on these, we designed seven tasks for quantitative assessment, categorized into: Complete Information, Incomplete Information, and Safety-Oriented Spatial Reasoning (SOSR). Complete information tasks utilize ASCII maps to minimize interpretation ambiguity and isolate spatial reasoning from visual processing. Incomplete information tasks require models to infer missing context, testing for spatial continuity versus hallucinations. SOSR tasks use natural language to evaluate safe decision-making in life-threatening contexts. We benchmark various LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across these tasks. Beyond aggregate performance, we analyze the implications of a 1% failure rate, highlighting how "rare" errors escalate into catastrophic outcomes. Results reveal serious vulnerabilities: several models achieved a 0% success rate in ASCII navigation, while in a simulated fire drill, models instructed robots to move toward hazardous areas instead of emergency exits. Our findings lead to a sobering conclusion: current LLMs are not ready for direct deployment in safety-critical systems. A 99% accuracy rate is dangerously misleading in robotics, as it implies one out of every hundred executions could result in catastrophic harm. We demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models cannot guarantee safety, and absolute reliance on them creates unacceptable risks.

Abstract: Recent progress in large language model (LLM) reasoning has focused on domains like mathematics and coding, where abundant high-quality data and objective evaluation metrics are readily available. In contrast, progress in LLM reasoning models remains limited in scientific domains such as medicine and materials science due to limited dataset coverage and the inherent complexity of open-ended scientific questions. To address these challenges, we introduce WildSci, a new dataset of domain-specific science questions automatically synthesized from peer-reviewed literature, covering 9 scientific disciplines and 26 subdomains. By framing complex scientific reasoning tasks in a multiple-choice format, we enable scalable training with well-defined reward signals. We further apply reinforcement learning to finetune models on these data and analyze the resulting training dynamics, including domain-specific performance changes, response behaviors, and generalization trends. Experiments on a suite of scientific benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our dataset and approach.

Abstract: As generative models become ubiquitous, there is a critical need for fine-grained control over the generation process. Yet, while controlled generation methods from prompting to fine-tuning proliferate, a fundamental question remains unanswered: are these models truly controllable in the first place? In this work, we provide a theoretical framework to formally answer this question. Framing human-model interaction as a control process, we propose a novel algorithm to estimate the controllable sets of models in a dialogue setting. Notably, we provide formal guarantees on the estimation error as a function of sample complexity: we derive probably-approximately correct bounds for controllable set estimates that are distribution-free, employ no assumptions except for output boundedness, and work for any black-box nonlinear control system (i.e., any generative model). We empirically demonstrate the theoretical framework on different tasks in controlling dialogue processes, for both language models and text-to-image generation. Our results show that model controllability is surprisingly fragile and highly dependent on the experimental setting. This highlights the need for rigorous controllability analysis, shifting the focus from simply attempting control to first understanding its fundamental limits.

Abstract: E-commerce platforms and payment solution providers face increasingly sophisticated fraud schemes, ranging from identity theft and account takeovers to complex money laundering operations that exploit the speed and anonymity of digital transactions. However, despite their theoretical promise, the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to fraud detection in real-world financial contexts remains largely unexploited, and their practical effectiveness in handling domain-specific e-commerce transaction data has yet to be empirically validated. To bridge this gap between conventional machine learning limitations and the untapped potential of LLMs in fraud detection, this paper proposes a novel approach that employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) to post-train lightweight language models specifically for fraud detection tasks using only raw transaction data. We utilize the Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) algorithm combined with a rule-based reward system to fine-tune language models of various sizes on a real-life transaction dataset provided by a Chinese global payment solution company. Through this reinforcement learning framework, the language models are encouraged to explore diverse trust and risk signals embedded within the textual transaction data, including patterns in customer information, shipping details, product descriptions, and order history. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with post-trained language models achieving substantial F1-score improvements on held-out test data. Our findings demonstrate that the observed performance improvements are primarily attributable to the exploration mechanism inherent in reinforcement learning, which allows models to discover novel fraud indicators beyond those captured by traditional engineered features.

Abstract: In web search and recommendation systems, user clicks are widely used to train ranking models. However, click data is heavily biased, i.e., users tend to click higher-ranked items (position bias), choose only what was shown to them (selection bias), and trust top results more (trust bias). Without explicitly modeling these biases, the true relevance of ranked items cannot be correctly learned from clicks. Existing Unbiased Learning-to-Rank (ULTR) methods mainly correct position bias and rely on propensity estimation, but they cannot measure remaining bias, provide risk guarantees, or jointly handle multiple bias sources. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel causal learning-based ranking framework that extends ULTR by combining Structural Causal Models (SCMs) with information-theoretic tools. SCMs specify how clicks are generated and help identify the true relevance signal from click data, while conditional mutual information, measures how much bias leaks into the
  learned relevance estimates. We use this leakage measure to define a rigorous notion of disentanglement and include it as a regularizer during model training to reduce bias. In addition, we incorporate a causal inference estimator, i.e., doubly robust estimator, to ensure more reliable risk estimation. Experiments on standard Learning-to-Rank benchmarks show that our method consistently reduces measured bias leakage and improves ranking performance, especially in realistic scenarios where multiple biases-such as position and trust bias-interact strongly.

Conclusion: CPSR通过同时利用知识图的结构和语义信息，有效提升了归纳知识图完成任务的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Conventional Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods aim to infer missing information in incomplete Knowledge Graphs (KGs) by leveraging existing information, which struggle to perform effectively in scenarios involving emerging entities. Inductive KGC methods can handle the emerging entities and relations in KGs, offering greater dynamic adaptability. While existing inductive KGC methods have achieved some success, they also face challenges, such as susceptibility to noisy structural information during reasoning and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies in reasoning paths. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Cumulative Path-Level Semantic Reasoning for inductive knowledge graph completion (CPSR) framework, which simultaneously captures both the structural and semantic information of KGs to enhance the inductive KGC task. Specifically, the proposed CPSR employs a query-dependent masking module to adaptively mask noisy structural information while retaining important information closely related to the targets. Additionally, CPSR introduces a global semantic scoring module that evaluates both the individual contributions and the collective impact of nodes along the reasoning path within KGs. The experimental results demonstrate that CPSR achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Conclusion: HAG框架有效综合宏观分布对齐与微观个体一致性，为基于智能体的建模提供了高保真、可主题适应的初始化方法，并通过专门评估基准验证了其优越性。

Abstract: High-fidelity agent initialization is crucial for credible Agent-Based Modeling across diverse domains. A robust framework should be Topic-Adaptive, capturing macro-level joint distributions while ensuring micro-level individual rationality. Existing approaches fall into two categories: static data-based retrieval methods that fail to adapt to unseen topics absent from the data, and LLM-based generation methods that lack macro-level distribution awareness, resulting in inconsistencies between micro-level persona attributes and reality. To address these problems, we propose HAG, a Hierarchical Agent Generation framework that formalizes population generation as a two-stage decision process. Firstly, utilizing a World Knowledge Model to infer hierarchical conditional probabilities to construct the Topic-Adaptive Tree, achieving macro-level distribution alignment. Then, grounded real-world data, instantiation and agentic augmentation are carried out to ensure micro-level consistency. Given the lack of specialized evaluation, we establish a multi-domain benchmark and a comprehensive PACE evaluation framework. Extensive experiments show that HAG significantly outperforms representative baselines, reducing population alignment errors by an average of 37.7% and enhancing sociological consistency by 18.8%.

Abstract: Hybrid action space, which combines discrete choices and continuous parameters, is prevalent in domains such as robot control and game AI. However, efficiently modeling and optimizing hybrid discrete-continuous action space remains a fundamental challenge, mainly due to limited policy expressiveness and poor scalability in high-dimensional settings. To address this challenge, we view the hybrid action space problem as a fully cooperative game and propose a \textbf{Cooperative Hybrid Diffusion Policies (CHDP)} framework to solve it. CHDP employs two cooperative agents that leverage a discrete and a continuous diffusion policy, respectively. The continuous policy is conditioned on the discrete action's representation, explicitly modeling the dependency between them. This cooperative design allows the diffusion policies to leverage their expressiveness to capture complex distributions in their respective action spaces. To mitigate the update conflicts arising from simultaneous policy updates in this cooperative setting, we employ a sequential update scheme that fosters co-adaptation. Moreover, to improve scalability when learning in high-dimensional discrete action space, we construct a codebook that embeds the action space into a low-dimensional latent space. This mapping enables the discrete policy to learn in a compact, structured space. Finally, we design a Q-function-based guidance mechanism to align the codebook's embeddings with the discrete policy's representation during training. On challenging hybrid action benchmarks, CHDP outperforms the state-of-the-art method by up to $19.3\%$ in success rate.

Abstract: Despite the success of test-time scaling, Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) frequently encounter repetitive loops that lead to computational waste and inference failure. In this paper, we identify a distinct failure mode termed Circular Reasoning. Unlike traditional model degeneration, this phenomenon manifests as a self-reinforcing trap where generated content acts as a logical premise for its own recurrence, compelling the reiteration of preceding text. To systematically analyze this phenomenon, we introduce LoopBench, a dataset designed to capture two distinct loop typologies: numerical loops and statement loops. Mechanistically, we characterize circular reasoning as a state collapse exhibiting distinct boundaries, where semantic repetition precedes textual repetition. We reveal that reasoning impasses trigger the loop onset, which subsequently persists as an inescapable cycle driven by a self-reinforcing V-shaped attention mechanism. Guided by these findings, we employ the Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) algorithm to capture these precursors for early loop prediction. Experiments across diverse LRMs validate its accuracy and elucidate the stability of long-chain reasoning.

However, existing approaches rely on a fixed logical formalism, a feature that limits robustness and adaptability. We propose a logic-parametric framework for neuro-symbolic NLI that treats the underlying logic not as a static background, but as a controllable component. Using the LogiKEy methodology, we embed a range of classical and non-classical formalisms into higher-order logic (HOL), enabling a systematic comparison of inference quality, explanation refinement, and proof behavior. We focus on normative reasoning, where the choice of logic has significant implications. In particular, we compare logic-external approaches, where normative requirements are encoded via axioms, with logic-internal approaches, where normative patterns emerge from the logic's built-in structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that logic-internal strategies can consistently improve performance and produce more efficient hybrid proofs for NLI. In addition, we show that the effectiveness of a logic is domain-dependent, with first-order logic favouring commonsense reasoning, while deontic and modal logics excel in ethical domains. Our results highlight the value of making logic a first-class, parametric element in neuro-symbolic architectures for more robust, modular, and adaptable reasoning.

Abstract: Verification is a key bottleneck in improving inference speed while maintaining distribution fidelity in Speculative Decoding. Recent work has shown that sequence-level verification leads to a higher number of accepted tokens compared to token-wise verification. However, existing solutions often rely on surrogate approximations or are constrained by partial information, struggling with joint intractability. In this work, we propose Hierarchical Speculative Decoding (HSD), a provably lossless verification method that significantly boosts the expected number of accepted tokens and overcomes joint intractability by balancing excess and deficient probability mass across accessible branches. Our extensive large-scale experiments demonstrate that HSD yields consistent improvements in acceptance rates across diverse model families and benchmarks. Moreover, its strong explainability and generality make it readily integrable into a wide range of speculative decoding frameworks. Notably, integrating HSD into EAGLE-3 yields over a 12% performance gain, establishing state-of-the-art decoding efficiency without compromising distribution fidelity.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly integrated into privacy-critical domains, yet existing evaluations of personally identifiable information (PII) leakage largely treat privacy as a static extraction task and ignore how a subject's online presence--the volume of their data available online--influences privacy alignment. We introduce PII-VisBench, a novel benchmark containing 4000 unique probes designed to evaluate VLM safety through the continuum of online presence. The benchmark stratifies 200 subjects into four visibility categories: high, medium, low, and zero--based on the extent and nature of their information available online. We evaluate 18 open-source VLMs (0.3B-32B) based on two key metrics: percentage of PII probing queries refused (Refusal Rate) and the fraction of non-refusal responses flagged for containing PII (Conditional PII Disclosure Rate). Across models, we observe a consistent pattern: refusals increase and PII disclosures decrease (9.10% high to 5.34% low) as subject visibility drops. We identify that models are more likely to disclose PII for high-visibility subjects, alongside substantial model-family heterogeneity and PII-type disparities. Finally, paraphrasing and jailbreak-style prompts expose attack and model-dependent failures, motivating visibility-aware safety evaluation and training interventions.

Method: 提出DynaDebate框架，包含三个核心机制：1）动态路径生成与分配，由专门的路径生成智能体产生多样化的逻辑解路径；2）过程中心辩论，注重逐步逻辑批判而非表面结果投票；3）基于触发的验证智能体，当出现分歧时激活外部工具进行客观验证。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，DynaDebate在多个基准测试中取得了优异性能，超越了现有的最先进多智能体辩论方法。

Conclusion: DynaDebate通过动态路径生成、注重过程逻辑和客观验证机制，有效解决了多智能体辩论中路径单一和简单投票的问题，显著提升了协作推理能力，为大语言模型多智能体系统的发展提供了新方向。

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of Large Language Model-based Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), which excel at collaborative decision-making and complex problem-solving. Recently, researchers have further investigated Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) frameworks, which enhance the reasoning and collaboration capabilities of MAS through information exchange and debate among multiple agents. However, existing approaches often rely on unguided initialization, causing agents to adopt identical reasoning paths that lead to the same errors. As a result, effective debate among agents is hindered, and the final outcome frequently degenerates into simple majority voting. To solve the above problem, in this paper, we introduce Dynamic Multi-Agent Debate (DynaDebate), which enhances the effectiveness of multi-agent debate through three key mechanisms: (1) Dynamic Path Generation and Allocation, which employs a dedicated Path Generation Agent to generate diverse and logical solution paths with adaptive redundancy; (2) Process-Centric Debate, which shifts the focus from surface-level outcome voting to rigorous step-by-step logic critique to ensure process correctness; (3) A Trigger-Based Verification Agent, which is activated upon disagreement and uses external tools to objectively resolve deadlocks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DynaDebate achieves superior performance across various benchmarks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art MAD methods.

Abstract: Vision-language models are increasingly deployed as computer-use agents (CUAs) that operate desktops and browsers. Top-performing CUAs are framework-based systems that decompose planning and execution, while end-to-end screenshot-to-action policies are easier to deploy but lag behind on benchmarks such as OSWorld-Verified. GUI datasets like OSWorld pose two bottlenecks: they expose only a few hundred interactive, verifiable tasks and environments, and expert trajectories must be gathered by interacting with these environments, making such data hard to scale. We therefore ask how reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) can best exploit a small pool of exist expert trajectories to train end-to-end policies. Naively mixing these off-policy traces into on-policy RLVR is brittle: even after format conversion, expert trajectories exhibit structural mismatch and distribution shift from the learner. We propose BEPA (Bi-Level Expert-to-Policy Assimilation), which turns static expert traces into policy-aligned guidance via self-rolled reachable trajectories under the base policy (LEVEL-1) and a per-task, dynamically updated cache used in RLVR (LEVEL-2). On OSWorld-Verified, BEPA improves UITARS1.5-7B success from 22.87% to 32.13% and raises a held-out split from 5.74% to 10.30%, with consistent gains on MMBench-GUI and Online-Mind2Web.

Conclusion: StackPlanner通过创新的内存控制机制解决了多智能体系统长期协作中的记忆效率问题，为基于大语言模型的多智能体系统提供了更稳定可靠的协作框架。

Abstract: Multi-agent systems based on large language models, particularly centralized architectures, have recently shown strong potential for complex and knowledge-intensive tasks. However, central agents often suffer from unstable long-horizon collaboration due to the lack of memory management, leading to context bloat, error accumulation, and poor cross-task generalization. To address both task-level memory inefficiency and the inability to reuse coordination experience, we propose StackPlanner, a hierarchical multi-agent framework with explicit memory control. StackPlanner addresses these challenges by decoupling high-level coordination from subtask execution with active task-level memory control, and by learning to retrieve and exploit reusable coordination experience via structured experience memory and reinforcement learning. Experiments on multiple deep-search and agent system benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enabling reliable long-horizon multi-agent collaboration.

Motivation: 现有RTS游戏环境要么计算需求较高，要么缺乏文本观测支持，限制了其用于大语言模型评估的适用性。

Method: 基于RTS游戏的塔防子类型构建TowerMind环境，提供像素、文本和结构化游戏状态的多模态观测，设计了五个基准关卡。

Conclusion: TowerMind作为轻量级多模态环境，填补了现有RTS游戏环境格局，为AI智能体领域提供了新的基准平台。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs) have positioned them as a promising paradigm for agents, with long-term planning and decision-making emerging as core general-purpose capabilities for adapting to diverse scenarios and tasks. Real-time strategy (RTS) games serve as an ideal testbed for evaluating these two capabilities, as their inherent gameplay requires both macro-level strategic planning and micro-level tactical adaptation and action execution. Existing RTS game-based environments either suffer from relatively high computational demands or lack support for textual observations, which has constrained the use of RTS games for LLM evaluation. Motivated by this, we present TowerMind, a novel environment grounded in the tower defense (TD) subgenre of RTS games. TowerMind preserves the key evaluation strengths of RTS games for assessing LLMs, while featuring low computational demands and a multimodal observation space, including pixel-based, textual, and structured game-state representations. In addition, TowerMind supports the evaluation of model hallucination and provides a high degree of customizability. We design five benchmark levels to evaluate several widely used LLMs under different multimodal input settings. The results reveal a clear performance gap between LLMs and human experts across both capability and hallucination dimensions. The experiments further highlight key limitations in LLM behavior, such as inadequate planning validation, a lack of multifinality in decision-making, and inefficient action use. We also evaluate two classic reinforcement learning algorithms: Ape-X DQN and PPO. By offering a lightweight and multimodal design, TowerMind complements the existing RTS game-based environment landscape and introduces a new benchmark for the AI agent field. The source code is publicly available on GitHub(https://github.com/tb6147877/TowerMind).

Motivation: 安全关键领域中的语言歧义可能带来严重后果，但现有体人工智能研究大多忽视了这个问题，假设指令总是清晰的。为填补这一安全空白，需要系统性地检测3D场景中指令的歧义性。

Method: 1. 首次定义开放词汇3D指令歧义检测任务；2. 构建大规模基准测试Ambi3D；3. 提出AmbiVer两阶段框架：第一阶段从多个视角收集视觉证据，第二阶段利用这些证据引导视觉语言模型判断指令歧义性。

Result: 研究表明，最先进的3D大语言模型在可靠判断指令是否歧义方面存在显著局限性。AmbiVer框架的实验证明了其在歧义检测任务上的有效性，为更安全的体人工智能奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 该研究为体人工智能的安全性和可信性迈出了重要一步，提出的新任务、基准测试和框架为后续研究提供了基础，代码和数据集已公开以促进该领域发展。

Abstract: In safety-critical domains, linguistic ambiguity can have severe consequences; a vague command like "Pass me the vial" in a surgical setting could lead to catastrophic errors. Yet, most embodied AI research overlooks this, assuming instructions are clear and focusing on execution rather than confirmation. To address this critical safety gap, we are the first to define Open-Vocabulary 3D Instruction Ambiguity Detection, a fundamental new task where a model must determine if a command has a single, unambiguous meaning within a given 3D scene. To support this research, we build Ambi3D, the large-scale benchmark for this task, featuring over 700 diverse 3D scenes and around 22k instructions. Our analysis reveals a surprising limitation: state-of-the-art 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to reliably determine if an instruction is ambiguous. To address this challenge, we propose AmbiVer, a two-stage framework that collects explicit visual evidence from multiple views and uses it to guide an vision-language model (VLM) in judging instruction ambiguity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the challenge of our task and the effectiveness of AmbiVer, paving the way for safer and more trustworthy embodied AI.

Abstract: We formalise recursive self-training in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative AI as a discrete-time dynamical system and prove that, as training data become increasingly self-generated ($α_t \to 0$), the system undergoes inevitably degenerative dynamics. We derive two fundamental failure modes: (1) Entropy Decay, where finite sampling effects cause a monotonic loss of distributional diversity (mode collapse), and (2) Variance Amplification, where the loss of external grounding causes the model's representation of truth to drift as a random walk, bounded only by the support diameter. We show these behaviours are not contingent on architecture but are consequences of distributional learning on finite samples. We further argue that Reinforcement Learning with imperfect verifiers suffers similar semantic collapse. To overcome these limits, we propose a path involving symbolic regression and program synthesis guided by Algorithmic Probability. The Coding Theorem Method (CTM) allows for identifying generative mechanisms rather than mere correlations, escaping the data-processing inequality that binds standard statistical learning. We conclude that while purely distributional learning leads to model collapse, hybrid neurosymbolic approaches offer a coherent framework for sustained self-improvement.

Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of multi-user covert communications over a fixed bandwidth in a multi-cell scenario with both eavesdroppers and malicious jammers. We propose an intelligent spectrum control (ISC) scheme that combines high-accuracy spectrum sensing with AI-assisted real-time decision-making to generate time-frequency dynamic occupation patterns for multiple legitimate users. The scheme can proactively avoid external interference and intra-system co-channel collisions, thereby improving covertness and reliability. Within this framework, we derive closed-form expressions for the detection error probability (DEP) of the eavesdropper and the reliable transmission probability (RTP) of legitimate users under multi-user joint detection. We then analytically optimize the transmission power that can maximize the covert rate (CR), as well as the maximum number of users that can access the system covertly and concurrently under given covertness and reliability constraints. Simulation results confirm the tight match between the analytical and Monte Carlo curves, and show that the proposed scheme can achieve a higher DEP, a larger RTP, and a greater multi-user capacity than the benchmark scheme.

Abstract: With the increasing threat posed by modulation classification to wireless security, this paper proposes a secure communication framework based on modulation order confusion (MOC), which intentionally disguises the original modulation as a higher- or lower-order one to mislead eavesdroppers. For single-antenna systems, two schemes are developed: symbol random mapping and symbol time diversity, enabling modulation order confusion with customized receivers. For multi-antenna systems, receiver-transparent MOC schemes are proposed, including series-expansion-based and constellation-path-based signal designs, and are further extended to RIS-assisted systems with joint beamformer and RIS reflection design. Numerical results show that the proposed schemes effectively defeat both deep-learning-based and expert-knowledge-based modulation classifiers without degrading communication performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we explore new connections between the cycles in the graph of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and the eigenvalues of the corresponding adjacency matrix. The resulting observations are used to derive fast, simple, recursive formulas for the number of cycles $N_{2k}$ of length $2k$, $k<g$, in a bi-regular graph of girth $g$. Moreover, we derive explicit formulas for $N_{2k}$, $k\leq 7$, in terms of the nonzero eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix. Throughout, we focus on the practically interesting class of bi-regular quasi-cyclic LDPC (QC-LDPC) codes, for which the eigenvalues can be obtained efficiently by applying techniques used for block-circulant matrices.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study error-correcting codes in the space $\mathcal{S}_{n,q}$ of length-$n$ multisets over a $q$-ary alphabet, motivated by permutation channels in which ordering is completely lost and errors act solely by deletions of symbols, i.e., by reducing symbol multiplicities.
  Our focus is on the \emph{extremal deletion regime}, where the channel output contains $k=n-t$ symbols. In this regime, we establish tight or near-tight bounds on the maximum code size. In particular, we determine the exact optimal code sizes for $t=n-1$ and for $t=n-2$, develop a refined analysis for $t=n-3$, and derive a general recursive puncturing upper bound for $t=n-k$ via a reduction from parameters $(n,k)$ to $(n-1,k-1)$.
  On the constructive side, we completely resolve the binary multiset model: for all $t\ge1$ we determine $S_2(n,t)$ exactly and give an explicit optimal congruence-based construction. We then study single-deletion codes beyond the binary case, presenting general $q$-ary constructions and showing, via explicit small-parameter examples, that the natural modular construction need not be optimal for $q\ge3$. Finally, we present an explicit cyclic Sidon-type linear construction for general $(q,t)$ based on a single congruence constraint, with redundancy $\log_q\!\bigl(t(t+1)^{q-2}+1\bigr)$ and encoding and decoding complexity linear in the blocklength $n$.

Abstract: A new shaping technique called coset shaping for coded QAM and PAM signaling is introduced and analyzed.

It is proven that as the length of the error-correcting code and the modulation order tend to infinity, the gap to capacity for the proposed shaping scheme can be made arbitrarily small. Numerical results and comparisons for the shaping scheme, along with nonbinary LDPC-coded QAM signaling, are presented.

Abstract: Modern wireless systems are envisioned to employ antenna architectures that not only transmit and receive electromagnetic (EM) waves, but also intentionally reflect and possibly transform incident EM waves. In this paper, we propose a mathematically rigorous framework grounded in Maxwell's equations for analyzing the complexity of EM far-field modeling of general antenna architectures. We show that-under physically meaningful assumptions-such antenna architectures exhibit limited complexity, i.e., can be modeled by finite-rank operators using finitely many parameters. Furthermore, we construct a sequence of finite-rank operators whose approximation error decays super-exponentially once the operator rank exceeds an effective bandwidth associated with the antenna architecture and the analysis frequency. These results constitute a fundamental prerequisite for the efficient and accurate modeling of general antenna architectures on digital computing platforms.

Abstract: A movable antennas (MAs)-enabled secure multiuser transmission framework is developed to enhance physical-layer security. Novel expressions are derived to characterize the achievable sum secrecy rate based on the secure channel coding theorem. On this basis, a joint optimization algorithm for digital beamforming and MA placement is proposed to maximize the sum secrecy rate via fractional programming and block coordinate descent. In each iteration, every variable admits either a closed-form update or a low-complexity one-dimensional or bisection search, which yields an efficient implementation. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and show that the MA-enabled design achieves higher secrecy rates than conventional fixed-position antenna arrays.

Motivation: 当无法获得准确系统模型或模型过于复杂时，传统模型控制方法面临挑战。现有数据驱动控制方法主要关注从数据直接构建控制器，而本文旨在利用数据评估系统基本理论特性，从而为控制策略的合理选择提供依据。

Method: 首先提出基于数据的条件来刻画离散时间线性系统（单/多输入输出）的向量相对度和零点动态稳定性。然后证明如何通过三种不同采样时间的零阶保持离散化重构连续时间系统，从而将结果扩展到组合数据集。最后提供可直接应用于观测数据的算法。

Conclusion: 该方法为数据驱动控制提供了新视角，通过评估系统基本特性而非直接构建控制器，能够在模型信息有限的情况下支持控制策略的合理选择，具有较强的实用性和扩展性。

Abstract: Data-driven control offers a powerful alternative to traditional model-based methods, particularly when accurate system models are unavailable or prohibitively complex. While existing data-driven control methods primarily aim to construct controllers directly from measured data, our approach uses the available data to assess fundamental system-theoretic properties. This allows the informed selection of suitable control strategies without explicit model identification. We provide data-based conditions characterizing the (vector) relative degree and the stability of the zero dynamics, which are critical for ensuring proper performance of modern controllers. Our results cover both single- and multi-input/output settings of discrete-time linear systems. We further show how a continuous-time system can be reconstructed from three sampling discretizations obtained via Zero-order Hold at suitable sampling times, thus allowing the extension of the results to the combined data collected from these discretizations. All results can be applied directly to observed data sets using the proposed algorithms.

Abstract: Electromagnetic formation flying (EMFF) is challenging due to the complex coupling between the electromagnetic fields generated by each satellite in the formation. To address this challenge, this article uses alternating magnetic field forces (AMFF) to decouple the electromagnetic forces between each pair of satellites. Each satellite's electromagnetic actuation system is driven by a sum of amplitude-modulated sinusoids, where amplitudes are controlled to achieve desired forces between each pair of satellites. The main contribution of this article is a 3-satellite experimental demonstration of decentralized closed-loop EMFF using AMFF. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of AMFF with at least 3 satellites in open or closed loop. This is noteworthy because the coupling challenges of EMFF are only present with more than 2 satellites, and thus, a formation of at least 3 is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of AMFF. The experiments are conducted on a ground-based testbed consisting of 3 electromagnetically actuated satellites on linear air tracks. The closed-loop experimental results are compared with behavior from numerical simulations.

### [83] [How Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism is Energizing the EU Carbon Market and Industrial Transformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05490)
*Joseph Nyangon,Brecht Seifi*

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 全球碳市场碎片化、透明度不足，欧盟推出碳边境调整机制（CBAM）以应对碳泄漏风险，并与欧盟碳排放交易体系（EU ETS）协同运作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球碳市场存在碎片化、定价透明度低和实证证据有限的问题，给投资者和政策制定者识别碳管理机会带来挑战。欧盟碳排放交易体系（EU ETS）虽助力减排，但也引发了对国际竞争力和碳泄漏的担忧，特别是在欧盟产业深度融入全球价值链的背景下。

Method: 欧盟委员会在2021年提出了碳边境调整机制（CBAM），该机制通过对选定的进口商品施加碳价格，使国内外生产者的碳成本趋于一致，从而与EU ETS协同运作，并逐步取代现有的碳泄漏缓解措施（如免费配额分配）。

Result: CBAM的初步适用范围涵盖电力、水泥、化肥、铝、铁和钢铁。

Conclusion: 随着《巴黎协定》下气候政策的加强，类似CBAM的机制预计将在管理碳相关贸易风险和支持向净零排放转型方面发挥日益重要的作用。

Abstract: The global carbon market is fragmented and characterized by limited pricing transparency and empirical evidence, creating challenges for investors and policymakers in identifying carbon management opportunities. The European Union is among several regions that have implemented emissions pricing through an Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). While the EU ETS has contributed to emissions reductions, it has also raised concerns related to international competitiveness and carbon leakage, particularly given the strong integration of EU industries into global value chains. To address these challenges, the European Commission proposed the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) in 2021. CBAM is designed to operate alongside the EU ETS by applying a carbon price to selected imported goods, thereby aligning carbon costs between domestic and foreign producers. It will gradually replace existing carbon leakage mitigation measures, including the allocation of free allowances under the EU ETS. The initial scope of CBAM covers electricity, cement, fertilizer, aluminium, iron, and steel. As climate policies intensify under the Paris Agreement, CBAM-like mechanisms are expected to play an increasingly important role in managing carbon-related trade risks and supporting the transition to net zero emissions.

Abstract: This paper presents SIaD-Tool, an open-source frequency-domain (FD) scanning solution for stability and interaction assessment in modern power systems. The tool enables multi-sequence identification in the abc, dq0, and 0pn frames and supports both series voltage and parallel current perturbation strategies. A novel perturbation scheme allows direct scanning in the target frame, simplifying the analysis of coupling effects and mirrored frequencies. SIaD-Tool is implemented on a multi-platform architecture, including MATLAB/Simulink and Python-PSCAD/EMTDC. Beyond system identification, it integrates automated stability evaluation through four standardized methods: Generalized Nyquist Criterion (GNC), modal impedance analysis, phase margin assessment, and passivity checks. Validation is carried out via extensive case studies involving passive elements, grid-following and grid-forming converters, offshore wind power plants, and the IEEE 9-bus system. Results confirm high accuracy, scalability, and robustness in detecting critical modes, interaction frequencies, oscillatory behavior, and stability margins.

Abstract: This paper proposes a framework for analysis of generalized homogeneous control systems under state quantization. In particular, it addresses the challenge of maintaining finite/fixed-time stability of nonlinear systems in the presence of quantized measurements. To analyze the behavior of quantized control system, we introduce a new type of discrete homogeneity, where the dilation is defined by a discrete group. The converse Lyapunov function theorem is established for homogeneous systems with respect to discrete dilations. By extending the notion of sector-boundedness to a homogeneous vector space, we derive a generalized homogeneous sector-boundedness condition that guarantees finite/fixed-time stability of nonlinear control system under quantized measurements. A geometry-aware homogeneous static vector quantizer is then designed using generalized homogeneous coordinates, enabling an efficient quantization scheme. The resulting homogeneous control system with the proposed quantizer is proven to be homogeneous with respect to discrete dilation and globally finite-time, nearly fixed-time, or exponentially stable, depending on the homogeneity degree. Numerical examples validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Current model structural discovery methods for power system dynamics impose rigid priors on the basis functions and variable sets of dynamic models while often neglecting algebraic constraints, thereby limiting the formulation of high-fidelity models required for precise simulation and analysis. This letter presents a novel large language model (LLM)-based framework for dynamic model discovery (LLM-DMD) which integrates the reasoning and code synthesis capabilities of LLMs to discover dynamic equations and enforce algebraic constraints through two sequential loops: the differential-equation loop that identifies state dynamics and associated variables, and the algebraic-equation loop that formulates algebraic constraints on the identified algebraic variables. In each loop, executable skeletons of power system dynamic equations are generated by the LLM-based agent and evaluated via gradient-based optimizer. Candidate models are stored in an island-based archive to guide future iterations, and evaluation stagnation activates a variable extension mechanism that augments the model with missing algebraic or input variables, such as stator currents to refine the model. Validation on synchronous generator benchmarks of the IEEE 39-bus system demonstrates the superiority of LLM-DMD in complete dynamic model discovery.

Abstract: Incentivizing flexible consumption of end-users is key to maximizing the value of local exchanges within Renewable Energy Communities. If centralized coordination for flexible resources planning raises concerns regarding data privacy and fair benefits distribution, state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., bi-level, ADMM) often face computational complexity and convexity challenges, limiting the precision of embedded flexible models. This work proposes an iterative resolution procedure to solve the decentralized flexibility planning with a central operator as a coordinator within a community. The community operator asks for upward or downward flexibility depending on the global needs, while members can individually react with an offer for flexible capacity. This approach ensures individual optimality while converging towards a global optimum, as validated on a 20-member domestic case study for which the gap in terms of collective bill is not more than 3.5% between the decentralized and centralized coordination schemes.

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be critical for time-sensitive data collection missions, yet existing research often relies on simulations that fail to capture real-world complexities. Many studies assume ideal wireless conditions or focus only on path planning, neglecting the challenge of making real-time decisions in dynamic environments. To bridge this gap, we address the problem of adaptive sensor selection for a data-gathering UAV, considering both the buffered data at each sensor and realistic propagation conditions. We introduce the Hover-based Greedy Adaptive Download (HGAD) strategy, designed to maximize data transfer by intelligently hovering over sensors during periods of peak signal quality. We validate HGAD using both a digital twin (DT) and a real-world (RW) testbed at the NSF-funded AERPAW platform. Our experiments show that HGAD significantly improves download stability and successfully meets per-sensor data targets. When compared with the traditional Greedy approach that simply follows the strongest signal, HGAD is shown to outperform in the cumulative data download. This work demonstrates the importance of integrating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)-aware and buffer-aware scheduling with DT and RW signal traces to design resilient UAV data-mule strategies for realistic deployments.

Abstract: Motivated by the recent introduction and large-scale deployment of BBR congestion control algorithms, multiple studies have investigated the performance and fairness implications of this shift from loss-based to delay-based congestion control. Given the potential Internet-wide adoption of BBR, we must also consider its robustness in network and system scenarios. One such scenario is Cloud-based Virtual Machine (VM) networking - highly relevant in today's CDN-centric Internet. Interestingly, previous work has shown significant performance problems of BBRv1-2 running in Xen VMs, with BBR performance dropping to almost zero when CPU credit is low. In this paper, we develop a framework for measuring TCP throughput under fully controlled CPU contention, which uses Linux deadline scheduling to emulate generalized CPU contention conditions. Our measurements reveal that - in stark contrast to Cubic! - BBR throughput can break down during CPU contention under any hypervisor and all tested BDP conditions. Characterizing this performance degradation on a fine-granular level, we show that CPU limited BBR senders are capped at very low throughput levels below 10-20 Mbps. This finding implies that an Internet-wide shift from Cubic to BBR could harm the Internet's overall robustness, if not deployed with caution. To detect and overcome CPU-limited throughput, we propose a minimal BBR patch which detects the problematic situation by monitoring inflight bytes and reacts by increasing the pacing rate to make better use of the available CPU time. We show that our BBR patch overcomes the throughput problem for the most critical cases.

Abstract: As emerging applications demand higher throughput and lower latencies, operators are increasingly deploying millimeter-wave (mmWave) links within x-haul transport networks, spanning fronthaul, midhaul, and backhaul segments. However, the inherent susceptibility of mmWave frequencies to weather-related attenuation, particularly rain fading, complicates the maintenance of stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. This creates a critical challenge: making admission decisions under uncertainty regarding future network capacity. To address this, we develop a proactive slice admission control framework for mmWave x-haul networks subject to rain-induced fluctuations. Our objective is to improve network performance, ensure QoS, and optimize revenue, thereby surpassing the limitations of standard reactive approaches. The proposed framework integrates a deep learning predictor of future network conditions with a proactive Q-learning-based slice admission control mechanism. We validate our solution using real-world data from a mmWave x-haul deployment in a dense urban area, incorporating realistic models of link capacity attenuation and dynamic slice demands. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our proactive solution achieves 2-3x higher long-term average revenue under dynamic link conditions, providing a scalable and resilient framework for adaptive admission control.

Motivation: 现代大规模专家混合架构存在显著的内存墙瓶颈，由稀疏计算带来的大内存开销限制了批次大小和序列长度，导致数据移动过多并影响性能和模型扩展。

Method: 采用端到端token调度方法和优化的数据结构来消除中间缓冲区和激活张量实例化，并结合协同设计的内核与智能激活检查点技术来减少内存占用。

Result: MoEBlaze相比现有MoE框架能够实现超过4倍的加速和超过50%的内存节省。

Conclusion: MoEBlaze通过系统协同设计有效解决了MoE架构中的内存瓶颈问题，为大规模模型训练提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了训练效率和可扩展性。

Abstract: The pervasive "memory wall" bottleneck is significantly amplified in modern large-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures. MoE's inherent architectural sparsity leads to sparse arithmetic compute and also introduces substantial activation memory overheads -- driven by large token routing buffers and the need to materialize and buffer intermediate tensors. This memory pressure limits the maximum batch size and sequence length that can fit on GPUs, and also results in excessive data movements that hinders performance and efficient model scaling. We present MoEBlaze, a memory-efficient MoE training framework that addresses these issues through a co-designed system approach: (i) an end-to-end token dispatch and MoE training method with optimized data structures to eliminate intermediate buffers and activation materializing, and (ii) co-designed kernels with smart activation checkpoint to mitigate memory footprint while simultaneously achieving better performance. We demonstrate that MoEBlaze can achieve over 4x speedups and over 50% memory savings compared to existing MoE frameworks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了TIME（Temporally Intelligent Meta-reasoning Engine），这是一个行为对齐框架，旨在让对话模型根据上下文和时间信号进行显式推理，减少推理令牌开销并提升时序敏感性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大语言模型在进行推理时，经常在响应的开头就暴露大量显式的“思考”过程，这种设计存在几个问题：一是开销高，二是模糊了可审计性，三是模型一旦开始输出就无法重新触发推理。此外，对话模型通常缺乏对时间结构的敏感性。为了解决这些问题，作者提出了TIME框架。

Method: TIME通过引入可选的内联ISO 8601时间标签、表示时间间隔的“滴答”轮次以及在回复中任何位置都可出现的短小思考块来增强对话。然后，采用包含一个多样化全批量对齐步骤的四阶段课程，训练模型学会在适当时机进行简短、现场推理，并保持面向用户的文本简洁。

Result: 作者在一个名为TIMEBench的时间基础对话基准上评估了TIME。该基准测试了时序性、常识在时间间隔下的表现、异常检测和连续性。结果显示，在4B到32B规模的模型上，TIME在有无“思维”模式下，TIMEBench得分均优于基础Qwen3模型，同时将推理令牌数量减少了一个数量级。

Conclusion: TIME框架成功地使大语言模型能够根据对话和时间信号进行上下文敏感的推理，在显著减少计算开销的同时，提升了对时间敏感任务的处理能力，为构建更高效、更具时间意识的AI对话系统提供了一种方法。

Abstract: Reasoning oriented large language models often expose explicit "thinking" as long, turn-global traces at the start of every response, either always on or toggled externally at inference time. While useful for arithmetic, programming, and problem solving, this design is costly, blurs claim level auditability, and cannot re-trigger explicit reasoning once the model begins presenting. Dialogue models are also largely blind to temporal structure, treating replies after seconds and replies after weeks as equivalent unless time is stated in text. We introduce TIME, the Temporally Intelligent Meta-reasoning Engine, a behavioral alignment framework that treats explicit reasoning as a context sensitive resource driven by discourse and temporal cues. TIME augments dialogue with optional ISO 8601 <time> tags, tick turns that represent silent gaps, and short <think> blocks that can appear anywhere in a reply. A four-phase curriculum including a small, maximally diverse full-batch alignment step trains Qwen3 dense models to invoke brief, in-place reasoning bursts and keep user facing text compact. We evaluate with TIMEBench, a temporally grounded dialogue benchmark probing chronology, commonsense under gaps and offsets, anomaly detection, and continuity. Across 4B to 32B scales, TIME improves TIMEBench scores over base Qwen3 in both thinking and no-thinking modes while reducing reasoning tokens by about an order of magnitude. Our training data and code are available at https://github.com/The-Coherence-Initiative/TIME and TIMEBench is available at https://github.com/The-Coherence-Initiative/TIMEBench

Abstract: Neuro-symbolic reasoning systems face fundamental challenges in maintaining semantic coherence while satisfying physical and logical constraints. Building upon our previous work on Ontology Neural Networks, we present an enhanced framework that integrates topological conditioning with gradient stabilization mechanisms. The approach employs Forman-Ricci curvature to capture graph topology, Deep Delta Learning for stable rank-one perturbations during constraint projection, and Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy for parameter optimization. Experimental evaluation across multiple problem sizes demonstrates that the method achieves mean energy reduction to 1.15 compared to baseline values of 11.68, with 95 percent success rate in constraint satisfaction tasks. The framework exhibits seed-independent convergence and graceful scaling behavior up to twenty-node problems, suggesting that topological structure can inform gradient-based optimization without sacrificing interpretability or computational efficiency.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a transformative distributed learning paradigm, enabling multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model under the coordination of a central server without sharing their raw training data. While FL offers notable advantages, it faces critical challenges in ensuring fairness across diverse demographic groups. To address these fairness concerns, various fairness-aware debiasing methods have been proposed. However, many of these approaches either require modifications to clients' training protocols or lack flexibility in their aggregation strategies. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing EquFL, a novel server-side debiasing method designed to mitigate bias in FL systems. EquFL operates by allowing the server to generate a single calibrated update after receiving model updates from the clients. This calibrated update is then integrated with the aggregated client updates to produce an adjusted global model that reduces bias. Theoretically, we establish that EquFL converges to the optimal global model achieved by FedAvg and effectively reduces fairness loss over training rounds. Empirically, we demonstrate that EquFL significantly mitigates bias within the system, showcasing its practical effectiveness.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of blood glucose from CGM is essential for preventing dysglycemic events, thus enabling proactive diabetes management. However, current forecasting models treat blood glucose readings captured using CGMs as a numerical sequence, either ignoring context or relying on additional sensors/modalities that are difficult to collect and deploy at scale. Recently, LLMs have shown promise for time-series forecasting tasks, yet their role as agentic context extractors in diabetes care remains largely unexplored. To address these limitations, we propose GlyRAG, a context-aware, retrieval-augmented forecasting framework that derives semantic understanding of blood glucose dynamics directly from CGM traces without requiring additional sensor modalities. GlyRAG employs an LLM as a contextualization agent to generate clinical summaries. These summaries are embedded by a language model and fused with patch-based glucose representations in a multimodal transformer architecture with a cross translation loss aligining textual and physiological embeddings. A retrieval module then identifies similar historical episodes in the learned embedding space and uses cross-attention to integrate these case-based analogues prior to making a forecasting inference. Extensive evaluations on two T1D cohorts show that GlyRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the art methods, achieving up to 39% lower RMSE and a further 1.7% reduction in RMSE over the baseline. Clinical evaluation shows that GlyRAG places 85% predictions in safe zones and achieves 51% improvement in predicting dysglycemic events across both cohorts. These results indicate that LLM-based contextualization and retrieval over CGM traces can enhance the accuracy and clinical reliability of long-horizon glucose forecasting without the need for extra sensors, thus supporting future agentic decision-support tools for diabetes management.

Abstract: Gaussian Process (GP) regression is a powerful nonparametric Bayesian framework, but its performance depends critically on the choice of covariance kernel. Selecting an appropriate kernel is therefore central to model quality, yet remains one of the most challenging and computationally expensive steps in probabilistic modeling. We present a Bayesian optimization framework built on kernel-of-kernels geometry, using expected divergence-based distances between GP priors to explore kernel space efficiently. A multidimensional scaling (MDS) embedding of this distance matrix maps a discrete kernel library into a continuous Euclidean manifold, enabling smooth BO. In this formulation, the input space comprises kernel compositions, the objective is the log marginal likelihood, and featurization is given by the MDS coordinates. When the divergence yields a valid metric, the embedding preserves geometry and produces a stable BO landscape. We demonstrate the approach on synthetic benchmarks, real-world time-series datasets, and an additive manufacturing case study predicting melt-pool geometry, achieving superior predictive accuracy and uncertainty calibration relative to baselines including Large Language Model (LLM)-guided search. This framework establishes a reusable probabilistic geometry for kernel search, with direct relevance to GP modeling and deep kernel learning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Non-injective functions are not invertible. However, non-injective functions can be restricted to sub-domains on which they are locally injective and surjective and thus invertible if the dimensionality between input and output spaces are the same. Further, even if the dimensionalities do not match it is often possible to choose a preferred solution from many possible solutions. Twin neural network regression is naturally capable of incorporating these properties to invert non-injective functions. Twin neural network regression is trained to predict adjustments to well known input variables $\mathbf{x}^{\text{anchor}}$ to obtain an estimate for an unknown $\mathbf{x}^{\text{new}}$ under a change of the target variable from $\mathbf{y}^{\text{anchor}}$ to $\mathbf{y}^{\text{new}}$. In combination with k-nearest neighbor search, I propose a deterministic framework that finds input parameters to a given target variable of non-injective functions. The method is demonstrated by inverting non-injective functions describing toy problems and robot arm control that are a) defined by data or b) known as mathematical formula.

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) provides a data-driven framework for approximating policies for large-scale combinatorial optimisation problems formulated as sequential decision problems (SDPs), where exact solution methods are computationally intractable. A central but underexplored aspect of IL in this context is the role of the \emph{expert} that generates training demonstrations. Existing studies employ a wide range of expert constructions, yet lack a unifying framework to characterise their modelling assumptions, computational properties, and impact on learning performance.
  This paper introduces a systematic taxonomy of experts for IL in combinatorial optimisation under uncertainty. Experts are classified along three dimensions: (i) their treatment of uncertainty, including myopic, deterministic, full-information, two-stage stochastic, and multi-stage stochastic formulations; (ii) their level of optimality, distinguishing task-optimal and approximate experts; and (iii) their interaction mode with the learner, ranging from one-shot supervision to iterative, interactive schemes. Building on this taxonomy, we propose a generalised Dataset Aggregation (DAgger) algorithm that supports multiple expert queries, expert aggregation, and flexible interaction strategies.
  The proposed framework is evaluated on a dynamic physician-to-patient assignment problem with stochastic arrivals and capacity constraints. Computational experiments compare learning outcomes across expert types and interaction regimes. The results show that policies learned from stochastic experts consistently outperform those learned from deterministic or full-information experts, while interactive learning improves solution quality using fewer expert demonstrations. Aggregated deterministic experts provide an effective alternative when stochastic optimisation becomes computationally challenging.

TL;DR: 提出名为 HINT 的知识蒸馏框架，通过分层强化学习和伪离线强化学习解决 MARL 中的教学策略生成、OOD 适应和观测空间不匹配问题


<details>

Motivation: 知识蒸馏（KD）在加速多智能体强化学习（MARL）方面有潜力，但面临三大瓶颈：复杂领域中高性能教学策略合成的困难、非分布状态的适应挑战，以及分散学生与集中教师之间观测空间不匹配的问题

Method: 提出HINT框架，采用分层RL构建可扩展的高性能教师；引入伪离线RL，使教师策略能同时利用教师和学生经验进行更新以改善OOD适应；应用基于性能的筛选机制，保留结果相关指导以减少观测不匹配

Result: 在FireCommander和MARINE等具有挑战性的合作领域测试，HINT表现优于基线方法，成功率提升60%到165%

Conclusion: HINT框架通过分层RL和伪离线RL等方法有效解决了MARL知识蒸馏中的关键瓶颈，显著提升了多智能体合作任务的性能

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) has the potential to accelerate MARL by employing a centralized teacher for decentralized students but faces key bottlenecks. Specifically, there are (1) challenges in synthesizing high-performing teaching policies in complex domains, (2) difficulties when teachers must reason in out-of-distribution (OOD) states, and (3) mismatches between the decentralized students' and the centralized teacher's observation spaces. To address these limitations, we propose HINT (Hierarchical INteractive Teacher-based transfer), a novel KD framework for MARL in a centralized training, decentralized execution setup. By leveraging hierarchical RL, HINT provides a scalable, high-performing teacher. Our key innovation, pseudo off-policy RL, enables the teacher policy to be updated using both teacher and student experience, thereby improving OOD adaptation. HINT also applies performance-based filtering to retain only outcome-relevant guidance, reducing observation mismatches. We evaluate HINT on challenging cooperative domains (e.g., FireCommander for resource allocation, MARINE for tactical combat). Across these benchmarks, HINT outperforms baselines, achieving improvements of 60% to 165% in success rate.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as automatic evaluators of generative AI outputs, a paradigm often referred to as "LLM-as-a-judge." In practice, LLM judges are imperfect predictions for the underlying truth and can exhibit systematic, non-random errors. Two main approaches have recently been proposed to address this issue: (i) direct measurementerror correction based on misclassification models such as Rogan-Gladen-style estimators, and (ii) surrogate-outcome approaches such as prediction-powered inference (PPI), which correct bias by calibrating prediction residuals on a small set of gold-standard human labels. In this paper, we systematically study the performance of these two approaches for estimating mean parameters (e.g., average benchmark scores or pairwise win rates). Leveraging tools from semiparametric efficiency theory, we unify the two classes of estimators by deriving explicit forms of efficient influence function (EIF)-based efficient estimators and characterize conditions under which PPI-style estimators attain strictly smaller asymptotic variance than measurement-error corrections. We verify our theoretical results in simulations and demonstrate the methods on real-data examples. We provide an implementation of the benchmarked methods and comparison utilities at https://github.com/yiqunchen/debias-llm-as-a-judge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于模型的历史拟合方法在涉及断层耦合流体-地质力学问题中应用困难，需要通过反演生成校准的后验地质模型。本文旨在开发一种无需显式生成后验模型即可评估断层滑动潜能的方法。

Method: 1）使用地质统计学软件生成O(1000)个先验地质模型（含异质渗透率/孔隙度场）；2）从先验分布中为每个实现采样不确定的地质力学和断层参数；3）使用GEOS进行耦合流动.地质力学模拟；4）训练具有堆叠卷积LSTM层的VAE，将压力/应变/有效法向应力/剪应力场映射到潜变量；5）结合监测井观测数据，通过DSI-VAE框架进行后验预测。

Conclusion: VAE-DSI框架为耦合地质力学问题提供了一种高效的无模型反演方法，成功应用于CO₂封存场景的断层滑动风险评估，避免了传统后验地质模型生成的复杂性。

Abstract: Accurately assessing the potential for fault slip is essential in many subsurface operations. Conventional model-based history matching methods, which entail the generation of posterior geomodels calibrated to observed data, can be challenging to apply in coupled flow-geomechanics problems with faults. In this work, we implement a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based data-space inversion (DSI) framework to predict pressure, stress and strain fields, and fault slip tendency, in CO${_2}$ storage projects. The main computations required by the DSI workflow entail the simulation of O(1000) prior geomodels. The posterior distributions for quantities of interest are then inferred directly from prior simulation results and observed data, without the need to generate posterior geomodels. The model used here involves a synthetic 3D system with two faults. Realizations of heterogeneous permeability and porosity fields are generated using geostatistical software, and uncertain geomechanical and fault parameters are sampled for each realization from prior distributions. Coupled flow-geomechanics simulations for these geomodels are conducted using GEOS. A VAE with stacked convolutional long short-term memory layers is trained, using the prior simulation results, to represent pressure, strain, effective normal stress and shear stress fields in terms of latent variables. The VAE parameterization is used with DSI for posterior predictions, with monitoring wells providing observed pressure and strain data. Posterior results for synthetic true models demonstrate that the DSI-VAE framework gives accurate predictions for pressure, strain, and stress fields and for fault slip tendency. The framework is also shown to reduce uncertainty in key geomechanical and fault parameters.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-SQL systems have been driven by larger models and improved datasets, yet progress is still limited by the scarcity of high-quality training data. Manual data creation is expensive, and existing synthetic methods trade off reliability and scalability. Template-based approaches ensure correct SQL but require schema-specific templates, while LLM-based generation scales easily but lacks quality and correctness guarantees. We introduce RingSQL, a hybrid data generation framework that combines schema-independent query templates with LLM-based paraphrasing of natural language questions. This approach preserves SQL correctness across diverse schemas while providing broad linguistic variety. In our experiments, we find that models trained using data produced by RingSQL achieve an average gain in accuracy of +2.3% across six text-to-SQL benchmarks when compared to models trained on other synthetic data. We make our code available at https://github.com/nu-c3lab/RingSQL.

Abstract: Recently, differentiable causal discovery has emerged as a promising approach to improve the accuracy and efficiency of existing methods. However, when applied to high-dimensional data or data with latent confounders, these methods, often based on off-the-shelf continuous optimization algorithms, struggle with the vast search space, the complexity of the objective function, and the nontrivial nature of graph-theoretical constraints. As a result, there has been a surge of interest in leveraging super-structures to guide the optimization process. Nonetheless, learning an appropriate super-structure at the right level of granularity, and doing so efficiently across various settings, presents significant challenges.
  In this paper, we propose ALVGL, a novel and general enhancement to the differentiable causal discovery pipeline. ALVGL employs a sparse and low-rank decomposition to learn the precision matrix of the data. We design an ADMM procedure to optimize this decomposition, identifying components in the precision matrix that are most relevant to the underlying causal structure. These components are then combined to construct a super-structure that is provably a superset of the true causal graph. This super-structure is used to initialize a standard differentiable causal discovery method with a more focused search space, thereby improving both optimization efficiency and accuracy.
  We demonstrate the versatility of ALVGL by instantiating it across a range of structural causal models, including both Gaussian and non-Gaussian settings, with and without unmeasured confounders. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that ALVGL not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but also significantly improves optimization efficiency, making it a reliable and effective solution for differentiable causal discovery.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in general coding tasks but encounter two key challenges when optimizing code: (i) the complexity of writing optimized code (such as performant CUDA kernels and competition-level CPU code) requires expertise in systems, algorithms and specific languages and (ii) requires interpretation of performance metrics like timing and device utilization beyond binary correctness. In this work, we explore inference-time search algorithms that guide the LLM to discover better solutions through iterative refinement based on execution feedback. Our approach, called MaxCode unifies existing search methods under a max-reward reinforcement learning framework, making the observation and action-value functions modular for modification. To enhance the observation space, we integrate a natural language critique model that converts raw execution feedback into diagnostic insights about errors and performance bottlenecks, and the best-discounted reward seen so far. Together, these provide richer input to the code proposal function. To improve exploration during search, we train a generative reward-to-go model using action values from rollouts to rerank potential solutions. Testing on the KernelBench (CUDA) and PIE (C++) optimization benchmarks shows that MaxCode improves optimized code performance compared to baselines, achieving 20.3% and 10.1% relative improvements in absolute speedup value and relative speedup ranking, respectively.

TL;DR: Hi-ZFO：一种结合零阶和一阶优化的混合框架，用于提升大语言模型微调的性能和效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准一阶优化方法容易使训练陷入尖锐、泛化性差的极小值，而零阶方法虽然探索能力强但收敛慢；在生成式任务中，巨大的输出和搜索空间会显著增加估计方差，使零阶方法既噪声大又效率低

Method: 提出Hi-ZFO分层混合优化框架：通过层重要性分析自适应划分模型，对关键层使用精确的一阶梯度更新，对不敏感层使用零阶优化；零阶优化不仅作为内存节省的替代方案，更是作为'有益随机性'的来源，帮助模型逃离一阶优化易停滞的局部极小值

Result: 在多种生成式、数学和代码推理任务中，Hi-ZFO始终实现更优性能，同时显著减少训练时间

Conclusion: 分层混合优化方法对大语言模型微调是有效的，成功结合了一阶优化的精确性和零阶优化的探索能力

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) using standard first-order (FO) optimization often drives training toward sharp, poorly generalizing minima. Conversely, zeroth-order (ZO) methods offer stronger exploratory behavior without relying on explicit gradients, yet suffer from slow convergence. More critically, our analysis reveals that in generative tasks, the vast output and search space significantly amplify estimation variance, rendering ZO methods both noisy and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{Hi-ZFO} (\textbf{Hi}erarchical \textbf{Z}eroth- and \textbf{F}irst-\textbf{O}rder optimization), a hybrid framework designed to synergize the precision of FO gradients with the exploratory capability of ZO estimation. Hi-ZFO adaptively partitions the model through layer-wise importance profiling, applying precise FO updates to critical layers while leveraging ZO optimization for less sensitive ones. Notably, ZO in Hi-ZFO is not merely a memory-saving surrogate; it is intentionally introduced as a source of "beneficial stochasticity" to help the model escape the local minima where pure FO optimization tends to stagnate. Validated across diverse generative, mathematical, and code reasoning tasks, Hi-ZFO consistently achieves superior performance while significantly reducing the training time. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of hierarchical hybrid optimization for LLM fine-tuning.

Abstract: Search-augmented large language models (LLMs) excel at knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating external retrieval. However, they often over-search -- unnecessarily invoking search tool even when it does not improve response quality, which leads to computational inefficiency and hallucinations by incorporating irrelevant context. In this work, we conduct a systematic evaluation of over-searching across multiple dimensions, including query types, model categories, retrieval conditions, and multi-turn conversations. Our finding shows: (i) search generally improves answer accuracy on answerable queries but harms abstention on unanswerable ones; (ii) over-searching is more pronounced in complex reasoning models and deep research systems, is exacerbated by noisy retrieval, and compounds across turns in multi-turn conversations; and (iii) the composition of retrieved evidence is crucial, as the presence of negative evidence improves abstention. To quantify over-searching, we introduce Tokens Per Correctness (TPC), an evaluation metric that captures the performance-cost trade-off for search-augmented LLMs. Lastly, we investigate mitigation approaches at both the query and retrieval levels and release the OverSearchQA to foster continued research into efficient search-augmented LLMs.

Abstract: The development of a cross-city accident prevention system is particularly challenging due to the heterogeneity, inconsistent reporting, and inherently clustered, sparse, cyclical, and noisy nature of urban accident data. These intrinsic data properties, combined with fragmented governance and incompatible reporting standards, have long hindered the creation of an integrated, cross-city accident prevention framework. To address this gap, we propose the Mamba Local-ttention Spatial-Temporal Network MLA-STNet, a unified system that formulates accident risk prediction as a multi-task learning problem across multiple cities. MLA-STNet integrates two complementary modules: (i)the Spatio-Temporal Geographical Mamba-Attention (STG-MA), which suppresses unstable spatio-temporal fluctuations and strengthens long-range temporal dependencies; and (ii) the Spatio-Temporal Semantic Mamba-Attention (STS-MA), which mitigates cross-city heterogeneity through a shared-parameter design that jointly trains all cities while preserving individual semantic representation spaces. We validate the proposed framework through 75 experiments under two forecasting scenarios, full-day and high-frequency accident periods, using real-world datasets from New York City and Chicago. Compared with the state-of-the-art baselines, MLA-STNet achieves up to 6% lower RMSE, 8% higher Recall, and 5% higher MAP, while maintaining less than 1% performance variation under 50% input noise. These results demonstrate that MLA-STNet effectively unifies heterogeneous urban datasets within a scalable, robust, and interpretable Cross-City Accident Prevention System, paving the way for coordinated and data-driven urban safety management.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A scoring system is a linear classifier composed of a small number of explanatory variables, each assigned a small integer coefficient. This system is highly interpretable and allows predictions to be made with simple manual calculations without the need for a calculator. Several previous studies have used mixed-integer optimization (MIO) techniques to develop scoring systems for binary classification; however, they have not focused on directly maximizing AUC (i.e., area under the receiver operating characteristic curve), even though AUC is recognized as an essential evaluation metric for scoring systems. Our goal herein is to establish an effective MIO framework for constructing scoring systems that directly maximize the buffered AUC (bAUC) as the tightest concave lower bound on AUC. Our optimization model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear optimization (MILO) problem that maximizes bAUC subject to a group sparsity constraint for limiting the number of questions in the scoring system. Computational experiments using publicly available real-world datasets demonstrate that our MILO method can build scoring systems with superior AUC values compared to the baseline methods based on regularization and stepwise regression. This research contributes to the advancement of MIO techniques for developing highly interpretable classification models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) scheme provides a stable variational framework for computing Wasserstein gradient flows, but its practical use is often limited by the high computational cost of repeatedly solving the JKO subproblems. We propose a self-supervised approach for learning a JKO solution operator without requiring numerical solutions of any JKO trajectories. The learned operator maps an input density directly to the minimizer of the corresponding JKO subproblem, and can be iteratively applied to efficiently generate the gradient-flow evolution. A key challenge is that only a number of initial densities are typically available for training. To address this, we introduce a Learn-to-Evolve algorithm that jointly learns the JKO operator and its induced trajectories by alternating between trajectory generation and operator updates. As training progresses, the generated data increasingly approximates true JKO trajectories. Meanwhile, this Learn-to-Evolve strategy serves as a natural form of data augmentation, significantly enhancing the generalization ability of the learned operator. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy, stability, and robustness of the proposed method across various choices of energies and initial conditions.

Abstract: Neural networks have shown state-of-the-art performances in various classification and regression tasks. Rectified linear units (ReLU) are often used as activation functions for the hidden layers in a neural network model. In this article, we establish the connection between the Poisson hyperplane processes (PHP) and two-layer ReLU neural networks. We show that the PHP with a Gaussian prior is an alternative probabilistic representation to a two-layer ReLU neural network. In addition, we show that a two-layer neural network constructed by PHP is scalable to large-scale problems via the decomposition propositions. Finally, we propose an annealed sequential Monte Carlo algorithm for Bayesian inference. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the classic two-layer ReLU neural network. The implementation of our proposed model is available at https://github.com/ShufeiGe/Pois_Relu.git.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce Parallel Coordinated Reasoning (PaCoRe), a training-and-inference framework designed to overcome a central limitation of contemporary language models: their inability to scale test-time compute (TTC) far beyond sequential reasoning under a fixed context window. PaCoRe departs from the traditional sequential paradigm by driving TTC through massive parallel exploration coordinated via a message-passing architecture in multiple rounds. Each round launches many parallel reasoning trajectories, compacts their findings into context-bounded messages, and synthesizes these messages to guide the next round and ultimately produce the final answer. Trained end-to-end with large-scale, outcome-based reinforcement learning, the model masters the synthesis abilities required by PaCoRe and scales to multi-million-token effective TTC without exceeding context limits. The approach yields strong improvements across diverse domains, and notably pushes reasoning beyond frontier systems in mathematics: an 8B model reaches 94.5% on HMMT 2025, surpassing GPT-5's 93.2% by scaling effective TTC to roughly two million tokens. We open-source model checkpoints, training data, and the full inference pipeline to accelerate follow-up work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统条件平均处理效应（CATE）估计需要大量样本（O(M/ε²)）来精准估计治疗效果，但实际治疗分配可能不需要如此精细的估计。本研究旨在探索治疗分配任务是否能通过更少的样本实现相近的分配效果。

Method: 提出了新的算法，利用对治疗效果分布的合理假设，证明粗粒度估计足以实现接近最优的治疗分配。同时引入预算灵活性进一步降低样本需求。算法在多个真实世界随机对照试验数据集上进行了验证。

Result: 算法仅需O(M/ε)样本量即可达到与CATE相似的总治疗效果，显著低于传统方法的O(M/ε²)。在所有测试的真实数据集中，都能以极少样本找到接近最优的治疗分配方案。

Conclusion: 治疗分配与治疗效果估计存在根本区别：前者需要的样本量远少于后者。该研究为资源受限场景下的精准医疗干预提供了更高效的样本利用方案。

Abstract: Conditional average treatment effect (CATE) estimation is the de facto gold standard for targeting a treatment to a heterogeneous population. The method estimates treatment effects up to an error $ε> 0$ in each of $M$ different strata of the population, targeting individuals in decreasing order of estimated treatment effect until the budget runs out. In general, this method requires $O(M/ε^2)$ samples. This is best possible if the goal is to estimate all treatment effects up to an $ε$ error. In this work, we show how to achieve the same total treatment effect as CATE with only $O(M/ε)$ samples for natural distributions of treatment effects. The key insight is that coarse estimates suffice for near-optimal treatment allocations. In addition, we show that budget flexibility can further reduce the sample complexity of allocation. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on various real-world RCT datasets. In all cases, it finds nearly optimal treatment allocations with surprisingly few samples. Our work highlights the fundamental distinction between treatment effect estimation and treatment allocation: the latter requires far fewer samples.

Motivation: 现有RLVR算法在不同粒度上各有优势：GRPO使用token级重要性比率进行精细信用分配但方差高、不稳定；GSPO使用序列级比率匹配序列级奖励但牺牲了token级信用分配。需要一种方法结合两者优势。

Method: DHPO在单一裁剪替代目标函数中桥接GRPO和GSPO，通过加权机制结合token级和序列级重要性比率，探索了平均混合和熵引导混合两种变体，并采用分支特定裁剪策略分别约束两个分支的比率，防止异常值主导更新。

Result: 在七个具有挑战性的数学推理基准测试上，对Qwen3系列的密集和MoE模型进行实验，DHPO一致超越GRPO和GSPO。

Conclusion: 通过动态混合细粒度和粗粒度策略优化方法，DHPO在保留精细信用分配的同时提高了稳定性，显著提升了大型语言模型在推理任务中的强化学习性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) offers a promising framework for optimizing large language models in reasoning tasks. However, existing RLVR algorithms focus on different granularities, and each has complementary strengths and limitations. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) updates the policy with token-level importance ratios, which preserves fine-grained credit assignment but often suffers from high variance and instability. In contrast, Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) applies single sequence-level importance ratios across all tokens in a response that better matches sequence-level rewards, but sacrifices token-wise credit assignment. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Hybrid Policy Optimization (DHPO) to bridge GRPO and GSPO within a single clipped surrogate objective. DHPO combines token-level and sequence-level importance ratios using weighting mechanisms. We explore two variants of the mixing mechanism, including an averaged mixing and an entropy-guided mixing. To further stabilize training, we employ a branch-specific clipping strategy that constrains token-level and sequence-level ratios within separate trust regions before mixing, preventing outliers in either branch from dominating the update. Across seven challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, experiments on both dense and MoE models from the Qwen3 series show that DHPO consistently outperforms GRPO and GSPO. We will release our code upon acceptance of this paper.

Abstract: Time series are highly valuable and rarely shareable across nodes, making federated learning a promising paradigm to leverage distributed temporal data. However, different sampling standards lead to diverse time granularities and variable sets across nodes, hindering classical federated learning. We propose PiXTime, a novel time series forecasting model designed for federated learning that enables effective prediction across nodes with multi-granularity and heterogeneous variable sets. PiXTime employs a personalized Patch Embedding to map node-specific granularity time series into token sequences of a unified dimension for processing by a subsequent shared model, and uses a global VE Table to align variable category semantics across nodes, thereby enhancing cross-node transferability. With a transformer-based shared model, PiXTime captures representations of auxiliary series with arbitrary numbers of variables and uses cross-attention to enhance the prediction of the target series. Experiments show PiXTime achieves state-of-the-art performance in federated settings and demonstrates superior performance on eight widely used real-world traditional benchmarks.

Abstract: Existing research on continual learning (CL) of a sequence of tasks focuses mainly on dealing with catastrophic forgetting (CF) to balance the learning plasticity of new tasks and the memory stability of old tasks. However, an ideal CL agent should not only be able to overcome CF, but also encourage positive forward and backward knowledge transfer (KT), i.e., using the learned knowledge from previous tasks for the new task learning (namely FKT), and improving the previous tasks' performance with the knowledge of the new task (namely BKT). To this end, this paper first models CL as an optimization problem in which each sequential learning task aims to achieve its optimal performance under the constraint that both FKT and BKT should be positive. It then proposes a novel Enhanced Task Continual Learning (ETCL) method, which achieves forgetting-free and positive KT. Furthermore, the bounds that can lead to negative FKT and BKT are estimated theoretically. Based on the bounds, a new strategy for online task similarity detection is also proposed to facilitate positive KT. To overcome CF, ETCL learns a set of task-specific binary masks to isolate a sparse sub-network for each task while preserving the performance of a dense network for the task. At the beginning of a new task learning, ETCL tries to align the new task's gradient with that of the sub-network of the previous most similar task to ensure positive FKT. By using a new bi-objective optimization strategy and an orthogonal gradient projection method, ETCL updates only the weights of previous similar tasks at the classification layer to achieve positive BKT. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed ETCL markedly outperforms strong baselines on dissimilar, similar, and mixed task sequences.

Abstract: We reveal that transformers trained in an autoregressive manner naturally encode time-delayed causal structures in their learned representations. When predicting future values in multivariate time series, the gradient sensitivities of transformer outputs with respect to past inputs directly recover the underlying causal graph, without any explicit causal objectives or structural constraints. We prove this connection theoretically under standard identifiability conditions and develop a practical extraction method using aggregated gradient attributions. On challenging cases such as nonlinear dynamics, long-term dependencies, and non-stationary systems, this approach greatly surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art discovery algorithms, especially as data heterogeneity increases, exhibiting scaling potential where causal accuracy improves with data volume and heterogeneity, a property traditional methods lack. This unifying view lays the groundwork for a future paradigm where causal discovery operates through the lens of foundation models, and foundation models gain interpretability and enhancement through the lens of causality.

Abstract: Wi-Fi fingerprinting remains one of the most practical solutions for indoor positioning, however, its performance is often limited by the size and heterogeneity of fingerprint datasets, strong Received Signal Strength Indicator variability, and the ambiguity introduced in large and multi-floor environments. These factors significantly degrade localisation accuracy, particularly when global models are applied without considering structural constraints. This paper introduces a clustering-based method that structures the fingerprint dataset prior to localisation. Fingerprints are grouped using either spatial or radio features, and clustering can be applied at the building or floor level. In the localisation phase, a clustering estimation procedure based on the strongest access points assigns unseen fingerprints to the most relevant cluster. Localisation is then performed only within the selected clusters, allowing learning models to operate on reduced and more coherent subsets of data. The effectiveness of the method is evaluated on three public datasets and several machine learning models. Results show a consistent reduction in localisation errors, particularly under building-level strategies, but at the cost of reducing the floor detection accuracy. These results demonstrate that explicitly structuring datasets through clustering is an effective and flexible approach for scalable indoor positioning.

Abstract: The SmoothLLM defense provides a certification guarantee against jailbreaking attacks, but it relies on a strict `k-unstable' assumption that rarely holds in practice. This strong assumption can limit the trustworthiness of the provided safety certificate. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a more realistic probabilistic framework, `(k, $\varepsilon$)-unstable,' to certify defenses against diverse jailbreaking attacks, from gradient-based (GCG) to semantic (PAIR). We derive a new, data-informed lower bound on SmoothLLM's defense probability by incorporating empirical models of attack success, providing a more trustworthy and practical safety certificate. By introducing the notion of (k, $\varepsilon$)-unstable, our framework provides practitioners with actionable safety guarantees, enabling them to set certification thresholds that better reflect the real-world behavior of LLMs. Ultimately, this work contributes a practical and theoretically-grounded mechanism to make LLMs more resistant to the exploitation of their safety alignments, a critical challenge in secure AI deployment.

TL;DR: 研究发现稀疏自编码器通过对比激活方法识别的特征主要捕捉推理的表层语言关联，而非真正的推理计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了验证稀疏自编码器是否真正识别了大型语言模型中的推理特征，论文提出一个旨在证伪的框架，用以测试特征激活是否反映真实的推理过程，还是仅仅依赖词汇层面的表面关联。

Method: 采用结合因果令牌注入实验和LLM引导的证伪框架。首先通过标准对比激活方法选取特征，然后引入少量特征相关令牌到非推理文本中引发特征激活，最后使用LLM生成证伪输入（激活特征的非推理文本与不激活特征的推理文本）。研究了20种配置，涵盖多个模型家族、层级和推理数据集。

Result: 在实验中发现，大部分特征对令牌级干预高度敏感：59%至94%的特征能被少量相关令牌激活，说明这些特征依赖词汇表面关联。剩余特征无法通过简单令牌触发解释，但LLM引导的证伪总能构造出激活特征的非推理输入及不激活特征的推理输入，没有一个特征满足真正的推理行为标准。对这些特征进行引导仅导致基准性能的微小变化或轻微下降。

Conclusion: 基于对比激活方法识别的稀疏自编码器特征主要捕捉的是与推理相关的语言表层关联，而非底层的推理计算本身。

Abstract: We investigate whether sparse autoencoders (SAEs) identify genuine reasoning features in large language models (LLMs). Starting from features selected using standard contrastive activation methods, we introduce a falsification-oriented framework that combines causal token injection experiments and LLM-guided falsification to test whether feature activation reflects reasoning processes or superficial linguistic correlates. Across 20 configurations spanning multiple model families, layers, and reasoning datasets, we find that identified reasoning features are highly sensitive to token-level interventions. Injecting a small number of feature-associated tokens into non-reasoning text is sufficient to elicit strong activation for 59% to 94% of features, indicating reliance on lexical artifacts. For the remaining features that are not explained by simple token triggers, LLM-guided falsification consistently produces non-reasoning inputs that activate the feature and reasoning inputs that do not, with no analyzed feature satisfying our criteria for genuine reasoning behavior. Steering these features yields minimal changes or slight degradations in benchmark performance. Together, these results suggest that SAE features identified by contrastive approaches primarily capture linguistic correlates of reasoning rather than the underlying reasoning computations themselves.

Abstract: Multi-turn conversational attacks, which leverage psychological principles like Foot-in-the-Door (FITD), where a small initial request paves the way for a more significant one, to bypass safety alignments, pose a persistent threat to Large Language Models (LLMs). Progress in defending against these attacks is hindered by a reliance on manual, hard-to-scale dataset creation. This paper introduces a novel, automated pipeline for generating large-scale, psychologically-grounded multi-turn jailbreak datasets. We systematically operationalize FITD techniques into reproducible templates, creating a benchmark of 1,500 scenarios across illegal activities and offensive content. We evaluate seven models from three major LLM families under both multi-turn (with history) and single-turn (without history) conditions. Our results reveal stark differences in contextual robustness: models in the GPT family demonstrate a significant vulnerability to conversational history, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) increasing by as much as 32 percentage points. In contrast, Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash exhibits exceptional resilience, proving nearly immune to these attacks, while Anthropic's Claude 3 Haiku shows strong but imperfect resistance. These findings highlight a critical divergence in how current safety architectures handle conversational context and underscore the need for defenses that can resist narrative-based manipulation.

Abstract: Transformer-based autoregressive models excel in data generation but are inherently constrained by their reliance on discretized tokens, which limits their ability to represent continuous values with high precision. We analyze the scalability limitations of existing discretization-based approaches for generating hybrid discrete-continuous sequences, particularly in high-precision domains such as semiconductor circuit designs, where precision loss can lead to functional failure. To address the challenge, we propose AGDC, a novel unified framework that jointly models discrete and continuous values for variable-length sequences. AGDC employs a hybrid approach that combines categorical prediction for discrete values with diffusion-based modeling for continuous values, incorporating two key technical components: an end-of-sequence (EOS) logit adjustment mechanism that uses an MLP to dynamically adjust EOS token logits based on sequence context, and a length regularization term integrated into the loss function. Additionally, we present ContLayNet, a large-scale benchmark comprising 334K high-precision semiconductor layout samples with specialized evaluation metrics that capture functional correctness where precision errors significantly impact performance. Experiments on semiconductor layouts (ContLayNet), graphic layouts, and SVGs demonstrate AGDC's superior performance in generating high-fidelity hybrid vector representations compared to discretization-based and fixed-schema baselines, achieving scalable high-precision generation across diverse domains.

TL;DR: 本文分析TRM模型在ARC-AGI-1任务中的性能来源，发现其表现主要来自测试时增强、任务标识依赖和浅层递归，而非深度推理能力。


<details>

Motivation: TRM被提出作为解决ARC风格任务的高效替代方案，但其性能究竟源于架构创新、测试时计算还是任务先验尚不清楚。本文旨在实证分析TRM在ARC-AGI-1上的实际表现。

Method: 通过四项实验分析：1)测试时增强和多数投票的影响；2)任务标识依赖性检验；3)递归轨迹分析；4)训练阶段增强对比。并对比TRM与QLoRA微调Llama 3 8B的效果。

Result: 发现：1)1000样本投票管道使Pass@1提升约11%；2)替换任务标识导致零准确率；3)大部分准确率在第一步递归即实现，递归深度有限；4)强化训练增强提高多样本成功率；TRM在吞吐量和内存使用上显著优于基准方法。

Conclusion: TRM在ARC-AGI-1上的性能主要源于效率优势、任务特定条件约束和激进的测试时计算，而非深度内部推理能力。

Abstract: Tiny Recursive Models (TRM) were proposed as a parameter-efficient alternative to large language models for solving Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) style tasks. The original work reports strong performance and suggests that recursive latent updates enable non-trivial reasoning, but it remains unclear how much of this performance stems from architecture, test-time compute, or task-specific priors. In this technical note, we empirically analyze the ARC Prize TRM checkpoint on ARC-AGI-1 and report four behavioral findings and an efficiency comparison. First, we show that test-time augmentation and majority-vote ensembling account for a substantial fraction of reported performance: the 1000-sample voting pipeline improves Pass@1 by about 11 percentage points over single-pass canonical inference. Second, a puzzle-identity ablation reveals strict dependence on task identifiers: replacing the correct puzzle ID with a blank or random token yields zero accuracy. Third, a recursion trajectory analysis shows that most of the final accuracy is achieved at the first recursion step and that performance saturates after few latent updates, indicating shallow effective recursion. Fourth, early-stage training experiments under canonical versus heavy augmentation regimes suggest that heavy augmentation broadens the distribution of candidate solutions and improves multi-sample success. Finally, we compare TRM with a naive QLoRA fine-tune of Llama 3 8B on canonical ARC-AGI-1, finding that TRM's non-autoregressive design achieves much higher throughput and substantially lower memory usage in this setting. Overall, TRM's ARC-AGI-1 performance appears to arise from an interaction between efficiency, task-specific conditioning, and aggressive test-time compute rather than deep internal reasoning.

Abstract: Traditional post-training quantization (PTQ) is considered an effective approach to reduce model size and accelerate inference of large-scale language models (LLMs). However, existing low-rank PTQ methods require costly fine-tuning to determine a compromise rank for diverse data and layers in large models, failing to exploit their full potential. Additionally, the current SVD-based low-rank approximation compounds the computational overhead. In this work, we thoroughly analyze the varying effectiveness of low-rank approximation across different layers in representative models. Accordingly, we introduce \underline{F}lexible \underline{L}ow-\underline{R}ank \underline{Q}uantization (FLRQ), a novel solution designed to quickly identify the accuracy-optimal ranks and aggregate them to achieve minimal storage combinations. FLRQ comprises two powerful components, Rank1-Sketch-based Flexible Rank Selection (R1-FLR) and Best Low-rank Approximation under Clipping (BLC). R1-FLR applies the R1-Sketch with Gaussian projection for the fast low-rank approximation, enabling outlier-aware rank extraction for each layer. Meanwhile, BLC aims at minimizing the low-rank quantization error under the scaling and clipping strategy through an iterative method. FLRQ demonstrates strong effectiveness and robustness in comprehensive experiments, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both quantization quality and algorithm efficiency.

Abstract: Hyper-Connections (HC) generalizes residual connections by introducing dynamic residual matrices that mix information across multiple residual streams, accelerating convergence in deep neural networks. However, unconstrained residual matrices can compromise training stability. To address this, DeepSeek's Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC) approximately projects these matrices onto the Birkhoff polytope via iterative Sinkhorn--Knopp (SK) normalization. We identify two limitations of this approach: (i) finite SK iterations do not guarantee exact doubly stochasticity, leaving an approximation gap that can accumulate through network depth and undermine stability; (ii) efficient SK implementation requires highly specialized CUDA kernels, raising engineering barriers and reducing portability. Motivated by the Birkhoff--von Neumann theorem, we propose mHC-lite, a simple reparameterization that explicitly constructs doubly stochastic matrices as convex combinations of permutation matrices. This approach guarantees exact doubly stochasticity by construction and can be implemented using only native matrix operations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that mHC-lite matches or exceeds mHC in performance while achieving higher training throughput with a naive implementation and eliminating the residual instabilities observed in both HC and mHC. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/FFTYYY/mhc-lite.

Motivation: 强震记录中的P波精确检测对地震早期预警至关重要，但面临高噪声、标记数据有限和复杂波形特征的挑战。传统方法受限于标注数据需求，需要探索自监督学习方案来应对这些难题。

Method: 将P波到达检测重构为自监督异常检测任务，通过系统网格搜索比较492种变分自编码器配置，重点分析跳跃连接和注意力机制对重建保真度与异常辨识权衡的影响机制。

Result: 跳跃连接虽然能最小化重建误差（MAE约0.0012），但会导致'过度泛化'问题，使模型重建噪声而掩盖检测信号。注意力机制优先考虑全局上下文而非局部细节，在0-40公里近源范围内取得0.91的AUC值，总体检测性能最佳（AUC 0.875）。

Conclusion: 架构设计需要优先考虑全局上下文而非像素级完美重建，这种约束对实现稳健的自监督P波检测至关重要。注意力机制在近源范围内的高性能表明其非常适合即时早期预警应用。

Abstract: Accurate P-wave detection is critical for earthquake early warning, yet strong-motion records pose challenges due to high noise levels, limited labeled data, and complex waveform characteristics. This study reframes P-wave arrival detection as a self-supervised anomaly detection task to evaluate how architectural variations regulate the trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and anomaly discrimination. Through a comprehensive grid search of 492 Variational Autoencoder configurations, we show that while skip connections minimize reconstruction error (Mean Absolute Error approximately 0.0012), they induce "overgeneralization", allowing the model to reconstruct noise and masking the detection signal. In contrast, attention mechanisms prioritize global context over local detail and yield the highest detection performance with an area-under-the-curve of 0.875. The attention-based Variational Autoencoder achieves an area-under-the-curve of 0.91 in the 0 to 40-kilometer near-source range, demonstrating high suitability for immediate early warning applications. These findings establish that architectural constraints favoring global context over pixel-perfect reconstruction are essential for robust, self-supervised P-wave detection.

Abstract: Algorithm extraction aims to synthesize executable programs directly from models trained on specific algorithmic tasks, enabling de novo algorithm discovery without relying on human-written code. However, extending this paradigm to Transformer is hindered by superposition, where entangled features encoded in overlapping directions obstruct the extraction of symbolic expressions. In this work, we propose the Discrete Transformer, an architecture explicitly engineered to bridge the gap between continuous representations and discrete symbolic logic. By enforcing a strict functional disentanglement, which constrains Numerical Attention to information routing and Numerical MLP to element-wise arithmetic, and employing temperature-annealed sampling, our method effectively facilitates the extraction of human-readable programs. Empirically, the Discrete Transformer not only achieves performance comparable to RNN-based baselines but crucially extends interpretability to continuous variable domains. Moreover, our analysis of the annealing process shows that the efficient discrete search undergoes a clear phase transition from exploration to exploitation. We further demonstrate that our method enables fine-grained control over synthesized programs by imposing inductive biases. Collectively, these findings establish the Discrete Transformer as a robust framework for demonstration-free algorithm discovery, offering a rigorous pathway toward Transformer interpretability.

Motivation: 现有的药物-靶标相互作用预测模型常常依赖于单模态的预定义分子描述符或代表性有限的基于序列的嵌入，这限制了预测的准确性和表达能力。

Result: 在多个DTI基准测试中，Tensor-DTI优于现有的基于序列和基于图的模型。在CDK2的十亿级化合物库上进行的大规模推理实验表明，即使CDK2在训练中被排除，Tensor-DTI也能生成化学上合理的命中分布。在与Glide对接和Boltz-2共折叠的富集研究中，Tensor-DTI在CDK2上保持竞争力，并在严格家族留出的情况下改善了恢复高亲和力配体所需筛选预算的效率。该方法还扩展到蛋白质-RNA和肽-蛋白质相互作用预测。

Conclusion: 整合多模态信息和对比学习目标能显著提升相互作用预测的准确性，并为虚拟筛选提供更可解释且可靠性更高的模型。

Abstract: Accurate drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction is essential for computational drug discovery, yet existing models often rely on single-modality predefined molecular descriptors or sequence-based embeddings with limited representativeness. We propose Tensor-DTI, a contrastive learning framework that integrates multimodal embeddings from molecular graphs, protein language models, and binding-site predictions to improve interaction modeling. Tensor-DTI employs a siamese dual-encoder architecture, enabling it to capture both chemical and structural interaction features while distinguishing interacting from non-interacting pairs. Evaluations on multiple DTI benchmarks demonstrate that Tensor-DTI outperforms existing sequence-based and graph-based models. We also conduct large-scale inference experiments on CDK2 across billion-scale chemical libraries, where Tensor-DTI produces chemically plausible hit distributions even when CDK2 is withheld from training. In enrichment studies against Glide docking and Boltz-2 co-folder, Tensor-DTI remains competitive on CDK2 and improves the screening budget required to recover moderate fractions of high-affinity ligands on out-of-family targets under strict family-holdout splits. Additionally, we explore its applicability to protein-RNA and peptide-protein interactions. Our findings highlight the benefits of integrating multimodal information with contrastive objectives to enhance interaction-prediction accuracy and to provide more interpretable and reliability-aware models for virtual screening.

Abstract: Transformers require positional encodings to represent sequence order, yet most prior work focuses on designing new positional encodings rather than examining how positional information is fused with token embeddings. In this paper, we study whether the fusion mechanism itself affects performance, particularly in long-sequence settings. We conduct a controlled empirical study comparing three canonical fusion strategies--element-wise addition, concatenation with projection, and scalar gated fusion--under identical Transformer architectures, data splits, and random seeds. Experiments on three text classification datasets spanning short (AG News), medium (IMDB), and long (ArXiv) sequences show that fusion choice has negligible impact on short texts but produces consistent gains on long documents. To verify that these gains are structural rather than stochastic, we perform paired-seed analysis and cross-dataset comparison across sequence-length regimes. Additional experiments on the ArXiv dataset indicate that the benefit of learnable fusion generalizes across multiple positional encoding families. Finally, we explore a lightweight convolutional gating mechanism that introduces local inductive bias at the fusion level, evaluated on long documents only. Our results indicate that positional-encoding fusion is a non-trivial design choice for long-sequence Transformers and should be treated as an explicit modeling decision rather than a fixed default.

Conclusion: 针对眼动数据特性的专门建模方法（如DSTS）比通用深度学习架构更有效，能为自闭症谱系障碍诊断提供更准确的工具，基于局部时间模式捕捉的设计能更好地利用眼动数据的特性。

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by deficits in social communication and behavioral patterns. Eye movement data offers a non-invasive diagnostic tool for ASD detection, as it is inherently discrete and exhibits short-term temporal dependencies, reflecting localized gaze focus between fixation points. These characteristics enable the data to provide deeper insights into subtle behavioral markers, distinguishing ASD-related patterns from typical development. Eye movement signals mainly contain short-term and localized dependencies. However, despite the widespread application of stacked attention layers in Transformer-based models for capturing long-range dependencies, our experimental results indicate that this approach yields only limited benefits when applied to eye movement data. This may be because discrete fixation points and short-term dependencies in gaze focus reduce the utility of global attention mechanisms, making them less efficient than architectures focusing on local temporal patterns. To efficiently capture subtle and complex eye movement patterns, distinguishing ASD from typically developing (TD) individuals, a discrete short-term sequential (DSTS) modeling framework is designed with Class-aware Representation and Imbalance-aware Mechanisms. Through extensive experiments on several eye movement datasets, DSTS outperforms both traditional machine learning techniques and more sophisticated deep learning models.

Abstract: Poisson non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a widely used method to find interpretable "parts-based" decompositions of count data. While many variants of Poisson NMF exist, existing methods assume that the "parts" in the decomposition combine additively. This assumption may be natural in some settings, but not in others. Here we introduce Poisson NMF with the shifted-log link function to relax this assumption. The shifted-log link function has a single tuning parameter, and as this parameter varies the model changes from assuming that parts combine additively (i.e., standard Poisson NMF) to assuming that parts combine more multiplicatively. We provide an algorithm to fit this model by maximum likelihood, and also an approximation that substantially reduces computation time for large, sparse datasets (computations scale with the number of non-zero entries in the data matrix). We illustrate these new methods on a variety of real datasets. Our examples show how the choice of link function in Poisson NMF can substantively impact the results, and how in some settings the use of a shifted-log link function may improve interpretability compared with the standard, additive link.

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning have been hindered by a persistent challenge: exploration collapse. The semantic homogeneity of random rollouts often traps models in narrow, over-optimized behaviors. While existing methods leverage policy entropy to encourage exploration, they face inherent limitations. Global entropy regularization is susceptible to reward hacking, which can induce meaningless verbosity, whereas local token-selective updates struggle with the strong inductive bias of pre-trained models. To address this, we propose Latent Policy Optimization via Iterative Information Bottleneck (IIB-LPO), a novel approach that shifts exploration from statistical perturbation of token distributions to topological branching of reasoning trajectories. IIB-LPO triggers latent branching at high-entropy states to diversify reasoning paths and employs the Information Bottleneck principle both as a trajectory filter and a self-reward mechanism, ensuring concise and informative exploration. Empirical results across four mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that IIB-LPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing prior methods by margins of up to 5.3% in accuracy and 7.4% in diversity metrics.

Abstract: In many problems in physics and engineering, one encounters complicated differential equations with strongly scale-dependent terms for which exact analytical or numerical solutions are not available. A common strategy is to divide the domain into several regions (patches) and simplify the equation in each region. When approximate analytic solutions can be obtained in each patch, they are then matched at the interfaces to construct a global solution. However, this patching procedure can fail to reproduce the correct solution, since the approximate forms may break down near the matching boundaries. In this work, we propose a learning framework in which the integration constants of asymptotic analytic solutions are promoted to scale-dependent functions. By constraining these coefficient functions with the original differential equation over the domain, the network learns a globally valid solution that smoothly interpolates between asymptotic regimes, eliminating the need for arbitrary boundary matching. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in representative problems from chemical kinetics and cosmology, where it accurately reproduces global solutions and outperforms conventional matching procedures.

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly embedded in societal infrastructure, auditing them for bias is of growing importance. However, in real-world deployments, auditing is complicated by the fact that model owners may adaptively update their models in response to changing environments, such as financial markets. These updates can alter the underlying model class while preserving certain properties of interest, raising fundamental questions about what can be reliably audited under such shifts.
  In this work, we study group fairness auditing under arbitrary updates. We consider general shifts that modify the pre-audit model class while maintaining invariance of the audited property. Our goals are two-fold: (i) to characterize the information complexity of allowable updates, by identifying which strategic changes preserve the property under audit; and (ii) to efficiently estimate auditing properties, such as group fairness, using a minimal number of labeled samples.
  We propose a generic framework for PAC auditing based on an Empirical Property Optimization (EPO) oracle. For statistical parity, we establish distribution-free auditing bounds characterized by the SP dimension, a novel combinatorial measure that captures the complexity of admissible strategic updates. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework naturally extends to other auditing objectives, including prediction error and robust risk.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation involves transferring the predictive capabilities of large, high-performing AI models (teachers) to smaller models (students) that can operate in environments with limited computing power. In this paper, we address the scenario in which only a few classes and their associated intermediate concepts are relevant to distill. This scenario is common in practice, yet few existing distillation methods explicitly focus on the relevant subtask. To address this gap, we introduce 'SubDistill', a new distillation algorithm with improved numerical properties that only distills the relevant components of the teacher model at each layer. Experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet with Convolutional and Transformer models demonstrate that SubDistill outperforms existing layer-wise distillation techniques on a representative set of subtasks. Our benchmark evaluations are complemented by Explainable AI analyses showing that our distilled student models more closely match the decision structure of the original teacher model.

Abstract: Reproducibility remains a persistent challenge in forecasting research and practice, particularly in business and financial analytics where forecasts inform high-stakes decisions. Traditional forecasting methods, while theoretically interpretable, often require extensive manual tuning and are difficult to replicate in proprietary environments. Machine learning approaches offer predictive flexibility but introduce challenges related to interpretability, stochastic training procedures, and cross-environment reproducibility. This paper examines Prophet, an open-source forecasting framework developed by Meta, as a reproducibility-enabling solution that balances interpretability, standardized workflows, and accessibility. Rather than proposing a new algorithm, this study evaluates how Prophet's additive structure, open-source implementation, and standardized workflow contribute to transparent and replicable forecasting practice. Using publicly available financial and retail datasets, we compare Prophet's performance and interpretability with multiple ARIMA specifications (auto-selected, manually specified, and seasonal variants) and Random Forest under a controlled and fully documented experimental design. This multi-model comparison provides a robust assessment of Prophet's relative performance and reproducibility advantages. Through concrete Python examples, we demonstrate how Prophet facilitates efficient forecasting workflows and integration with analytical pipelines. The study positions Prophet within the broader context of reproducible research. It highlights Prophet's role as a methodological building block that supports verification, auditability, and methodological rigor. This work provides researchers and practitioners with a practical reference framework for reproducible forecasting in Python-based research workflows.

Abstract: The rapid deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has led to large-scale sensor networks that monitor environmental and urban phenomena in real time. Communities of Interest (CoIs) provide a promising paradigm for organising heterogeneous IoT sensor networks by grouping devices with similar operational and environmental characteristics. This work presents an anomaly detection framework based on the CoI paradigm by grouping sensors into communities using a fused similarity matrix that incorporates temporal correlations via Spearman coefficients, spatial proximity using Gaussian distance decay, and elevation similarities. For each community, representative stations based on the best silhouette are selected and three autoencoder architectures (BiLSTM, LSTM, and MLP) are trained using Bayesian hyperparameter optimization with expanding window cross-validation and tested on stations from the same cluster and the best representative stations of other clusters. The models are trained on normal temperature patterns of the data and anomalies are detected through reconstruction error analysis. Experimental results show a robust within-community performance across the evaluated configurations, while variations across communities are observed. Overall, the results support the applicability of community-based model sharing in reducing computational overhead and to analyse model generalisability across IoT sensor networks.

Abstract: Automated seizure detection from electroencephalography (EEG) remains difficult due to the large variability of seizure dynamics across patients, recording conditions, and clinical settings. We introduce LookAroundNet, a transformer-based seizure detector that uses a wider temporal window of EEG data to model seizure activity. The seizure detector incorporates EEG signals before and after the segment of interest, reflecting how clinicians use surrounding context when interpreting EEG recordings. We evaluate the proposed method on multiple EEG datasets spanning diverse clinical environments, patient populations, and recording modalities, including routine clinical EEG and long-term ambulatory recordings, in order to study performance across varying data distributions. The evaluation includes publicly available datasets as well as a large proprietary collection of home EEG recordings, providing complementary views of controlled clinical data and unconstrained home-monitoring conditions. Our results show that LookAroundNet achieves strong performance across datasets, generalizes well to previously unseen recording conditions, and operates with computational costs compatible with real-world clinical deployment. The results indicate that extended temporal context, increased training data diversity, and model ensembling are key factors for improving performance. This work contributes to moving automatic seizure detection models toward clinically viable solutions.
