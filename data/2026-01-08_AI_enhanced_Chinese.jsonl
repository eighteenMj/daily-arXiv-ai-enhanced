However, existing evaluations rarely assess whether such agents remain safe, protocol compliant, and effective under realistic next generation networking constraints. This paper introduces $\u03b1^3$-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating LLM driven UAV autonomy as a multi turn conversational reasoning and control problem operating under dynamic 6G conditions. Each mission is formulated as a language mediated control loop between an LLM based UAV agent and a human operator, where decisions must satisfy strict schema validity, mission policies, speaker alternation, and safety constraints while adapting to fluctuating network slices, latency, jitter, packet loss, throughput, and edge load variations.\n  To reflect modern agentic workflows, $\u03b1^3$-Bench integrates a dual action layer supporting both tool calls and agent to agent coordination, enabling evaluation of tool use consistency and multi agent interactions. We construct a large scale corpus of 113k conversational UAV episodes grounded in UAVBench scenarios and evaluate 17 state of the art LLMs using a fixed subset of 50 episodes per scenario under deterministic decoding. We propose a composite $\u03b1^3$ metric that unifies six pillars: Task Outcome, Safety Policy, Tool Consistency, Interaction Quality, Network Robustness, and Communication Cost, with efficiency normalized scores per second and per thousand tokens. Results show that while several models achieve high mission success and safety compliance, robustness and efficiency vary significantly under degraded 6G conditions, highlighting the need for network aware and resource efficient LLM based UAV agents.

We challenge this paradigm by demonstrating that powerful pre-trained text-conditioned image editing models can be efficiently adapted for multiple restoration tasks through parameter-efficient fine-tuning with remarkably few examples. Our approach fine-tunes LoRA adapters on FLUX.1 Kontext, a state-of-the-art 12B parameter flow matching model for image-to-image translation, using only 16-128 paired images per task, guided by simple text prompts that specify the restoration operation. Unlike existing methods that train specialized restoration networks from scratch with thousands of samples, we leverage the rich visual priors already encoded in large-scale pre-trained editing models, dramatically reducing data requirements while maintaining high perceptual quality. A single unified LoRA adapter, conditioned on task-specific text prompts, effectively handles multiple degradations including denoising, deraining, and dehazing. Through comprehensive ablation studies, we analyze: (i) the impact of training set size on restoration quality, (ii) trade-offs between task-specific versus unified multi-task adapters, (iii) the role of text encoder fine-tuning, and (iv) zero-shot baseline performance. While our method prioritizes perceptual quality over pixel-perfect reconstruction metrics like PSNR/SSIM, our results demonstrate that pre-trained image editing models, when properly adapted, offer a compelling and data-efficient alternative to traditional image restoration approaches, opening new avenues for few-shot, prompt-guided image enhancement.

To address this fundamental bottleneck, we propose a flexible-duplex cell-free (CF) architecture in which each distributed access point (AP) can dynamically operate either as a receive AP for UAV uplink collection or as a transmit AP that generates cooperative artificial noise (AN) for secrecy enhancement. Such AP-level duplex flexibility introduces an additional spatial degree of freedom that enables distributed and adaptive protection against wiretapping in LAWNs. Building upon this architecture, we formulate a max-min secrecy-rate problem that jointly optimizes AP mode selection, receive combining, and AN covariance design. This tightly coupled and nonconvex optimization is tackled by first deriving the optimal receive combiners in closed form, followed by developing a penalty dual decomposition (PDD) algorithm with guaranteed convergence to a stationary solution. To further reduce computational burden, we propose a low-complexity sequential scheme that determines AP modes via a heuristic metric and then updates the AN covariance matrices through closed-form iterations embedded in the PDD framework. Simulation results show that the proposed flexible-duplex architecture yields substantial secrecy-rate gains over CF systems with fixed AP roles. The joint optimization method attains the highest secrecy performance, while the low-complexity approach achieves over 90% of the optimal performance with an order-of-magnitude lower computational complexity, offering a practical solution for secure uplink communications in LAWNs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In addition, we study MDS codes and the simplex code, demonstrating how these classical families fit within our framework, and establish new cases of an open conjecture from \\cite{YAAKOBI2020} concerning the minimal $t$ for which the simplex code is a $t$-functional batch code.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86t-all-symbol PIR\u7801\u548cbatch\u7801\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u5c0f\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u7801\u957f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u7801\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u7801\u957f\u3001\u7ef4\u6570\u3001\u6700\u5c0f\u8ddd\u79bb\u548ct\u503c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7edf\u4e00\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u5305\u62ec\u4e00\u6b65\u591a\u6570\u903b\u8f91\u53ef\u8bd1\u7801\u3001PIR\u7801\u548cbatch\u7801\u5728\u5185\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u8457\u540d\u7801\u65cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u4f9b\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4ee3\u6570\u7f16\u7801\u7406\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790t-all-symbol PIR\u7801\u548cbatch\u7801\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u5b58\u50a8\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u6700\u5c0f\u7801\u957f\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u5bdfMDS\u7801\u548c\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\u7801\u5728\u6b64\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u5c0f\u53c2\u6570k\u548ct\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u7801\u957f\uff0c\u8868\u5f81\u4e86\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u7801\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\u7801\u662ft-functional batch\u7801\u7684\u731c\u60f3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b58\u50a8\u7801\u65cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86PIR\u548cbatch\u7801\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u5355\u7eaf\u5f62\u7801\u4f5c\u4e3abatch\u7801\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u731c\u60f3\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

In practical applications, the suspension point of the slung load does not always align with the center of mass (CoM) of the UAV due to mission requirements or mechanical interference. This offset creates coupling in the system's nonlinear dynamics which leads to a complicated motion control problem. In existing research, modeling of the system are performed about the UAV's CoM. In this work we use the point of suspension instead. Based on the new model, a cascade control strategy is developed. In the middle-loop controller, the acceleration of the suspension point is used to regulate the swing angle of the slung load without the need for considering the coupling between the slung load and the UAV. Using the off-center reference frame, an inner-loop controller is designed to track the UAV's attitude without the need of simplification on the coupling effects. We prove local exponential stability of the closed-loop using Lyapunov approach.

Our method integrates a state-of-the-art pediatric brain tumor segmentation framework with radiomic feature extraction and clinical data through an ensemble of a Swin UNETR encoder and XGBoost classifier. The segmentation model delineates four tumor subregions enhancing tumor, non-enhancing tumor, cystic component and edema which are used to extract imaging biomarkers and generate predictive features. The Swin UNETR network classifies the response to treatment directly from these segmented MRI scans, while XGBoost predicts response using radiomics and clinical variables including legal sex, ethnicity, race, age at event (in days), molecular subtype, tumor locations, initial surgery status, metastatic status, metastasis location, chemotherapy type, protocol name and chemotherapy agents. The ensemble output provides a non-invasive estimate of chemotherapy response in this historically challenging population characterized by lower progression-free survival. Among compared approaches, our Swin-Ensemble achieved the best performance (precision for non effective cases=0.68, recall for non effective cases=0.85, precision for chemotherapy effective cases=0.64 and overall accuracy=0.69), outperforming Mamba-FeatureFuse, Swin UNETR encoder, and Swin-FeatureFuse models.

However, as the number of erased concepts grows, these methods often become inefficient and ineffective, since each concept requires a separate set of fine-tuned parameters and may degrade the overall generation quality. In this work, we propose a supertype-subtype concept hierarchy that organizes erased concepts into a parent-child structure. Each erased concept is treated as a child node, and semantically related concepts (e.g., macaw, and bald eagle) are grouped under a shared parent node, referred to as a supertype concept (e.g., bird). Rather than erasing concepts individually, we introduce an effective and efficient group-wise suppression method, where semantically similar concepts are grouped and erased jointly by sharing a single set of learnable parameters. During the erasure phase, standard diffusion regularization is applied to preserve denoising process in unmasked regions. To mitigate the degradation of supertype generation caused by excessive erasure of semantically related subtypes, we propose a novel method called Supertype-Preserving Low-Rank Adaptation (SuPLoRA), which encodes the supertype concept information in the frozen down-projection matrix and updates only the up-projection matrix during erasure. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of SuPLoRA in mitigating generation performance degradation.

While policy ratio clipping stabilizes training, this heuristic hard constraint incurs a fundamental cost: it indiscriminately truncates gradients from high-return yet high-divergence actions, suppressing rare but highly informative \"eureka moments\" in complex reasoning. Moreover, once data becomes slightly stale, hard clipping renders it unusable, leading to severe sample inefficiency. In this work, we revisit the trust-region objective in policy optimization and show that explicitly constraining the \\emph{variance (second central moment) of the policy ratio} provides a principled and smooth relaxation of hard clipping. This distributional constraint stabilizes policy updates while preserving gradient signals from valuable trajectories. Building on this insight, we propose $R^2VPO$ (Ratio-Variance Regularized Policy Optimization), a novel primal-dual framework that supports stable on-policy learning and enables principled off-policy data reuse by dynamically reweighting stale samples rather than discarding them.

Inspired by the success of using multiple local updates in federated learning, incorporating local updates into distributed optimization has recently attracted increasing attention. However, unlike federated learning, where multiple local updates can accelerate learning by improving gradient estimation under mini-batch settings, it remains unclear whether similar benefits hold in distributed optimization when gradients are exact. Moreover, existing theoretical results typically require reducing the step size when multiple local updates are employed, which can entirely offset any potential benefit of these additional local updates and obscure their true impact on convergence. In this paper, we focus on the classic DIGing algorithm and leverage the tight performance bounds provided by Performance Estimation Problems (PEP) to show that incorporating local updates can indeed accelerate distributed optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first rigorous demonstration of such acceleration for a broad class of objective functions. Our analysis further reveals that, under an appropriate step size, performing only two local updates is sufficient to achieve the maximal possible improvement, and that additional local updates provide no further gains. Because more updates increase computational cost, these findings offer practical guidance for efficient implementation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets corroborate the theoretical findings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper revisits a fundamental yet seldom systematically studied question: how VLM choice and competence translate to downstream VLA policies performance? We introduce VLM4VLA, a minimal adaptation pipeline that converts general-purpose VLMs into VLA policies using only a small set of new learnable parameters for fair and efficient comparison. Despite its simplicity, VLM4VLA proves surprisingly competitive with more sophisticated network designs. Through extensive empirical studies on various downstream tasks across three benchmarks, we find that while VLM initialization offers a consistent benefit over training from scratch, a VLM's general capabilities are poor predictors of its downstream task performance. This challenges common assumptions, indicating that standard VLM competence is necessary but insufficient for effective embodied control. We further investigate the impact of specific embodied capabilities by fine-tuning VLMs on seven auxiliary embodied tasks (e.g., embodied QA, visual pointing, depth estimation). Contrary to intuition, improving a VLM's performance on specific embodied skills does not guarantee better downstream control performance. Finally, modality-level ablations identify the visual module in VLM, rather than the language component, as the primary performance bottleneck. We demonstrate that injecting control-relevant supervision into the vision encoder of the VLM yields consistent gains, even when the encoder remains frozen during downstream fine-tuning. This isolates a persistent domain gap between current VLM pretraining objectives and the requirements of embodied action-planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive framework for self-consistent radiology report generation.

Building on this foundation, we introduce a novel \"Reason-then-Summarize\" architecture optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).

By utilizing a multi-dimensional composite reward function, we explicitly penalize logical discrepancies between the generated narrative and the final diagnosis.

Despite strong benchmark performance, PFM robustness to real-world technical domain shifts, such as variability from whole-slide scanner devices, remains poorly understood. We systematically evaluated the robustness of 14 PFMs to scanner-induced variability, including state-of-the-art models, earlier self-supervised models, and a baseline trained on natural images. Using a multiscanner dataset of 384 breast cancer WSIs scanned on five devices, we isolated scanner effects independently from biological and laboratory confounders. Robustness is assessed via complementary unsupervised embedding analyses and a set of clinicopathological supervised prediction tasks. Our results demonstrate that current PFMs are not invariant to scanner-induced domain shifts. Most models encode pronounced scanner-specific variability in their embedding spaces. While AUC often remains stable, this masks a critical failure mode: scanner variability systematically alters the embedding space and impacts calibration of downstream model predictions, resulting in scanner-dependent bias that can impact reliability in clinical use cases. We further show that robustness is not a simple function of training data scale, model size, or model recency. None of the models provided reliable robustness against scanner-induced variability. While the models trained on the most diverse data, here represented by vision-language models, appear to have an advantage with respect to robustness, they underperformed on downstream supervised tasks. We conclude that development and evaluation of PFMs requires moving beyond accuracy-centric benchmarks toward explicit evaluation and optimisation of embedding stability and calibration under realistic acquisition variability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Contrasted to risk and reliability, which have robust quantification approaches and undergird many regulatory approaches to system safety (e.g., \"risk-informed decision-making\"), resiliency is a diffuse, qualitatively-understood characteristic, often treated differently or distinctly. However, in the emerging context of highly-complex, highly-interdependent critical systems, the idea of reliability (as the probability of non-failure) may not be an appropriate metric of system health.

However, its use in clinical practice is limited by cost, turnaround time, and tissue requirements, thereby restricting its application in the management of PDAC. We introduce PanSubNet, an interpretable deep learning framework that predicts therapy-relevant molecular subtypes directly from standard H&E-stained WSIs. PanSubNet was developed using data from 1,055 patients across two multi-institutional cohorts (PANCAN, n=846; TCGA, n=209) with paired histology and RNA-seq data. Ground-truth labels were derived using the validated Moffitt 50-gene signature refined by GATA6 expression. The model employs dual-scale architecture that fuses cellular-level morphology with tissue-level architecture, leveraging attention mechanisms for multi-scale representation learning and transparent feature attribution. On internal validation within PANCAN using five-fold cross-validation, PanSubNet achieved mean AUC of 88.5% with balanced sensitivity and specificity. External validation on the independent TCGA cohort without fine-tuning demonstrated robust generalizability (AUC 84.0%). PanSubNet preserved and, in metastatic disease, strengthened prognostic stratification compared to RNA-seq based labels. Prediction uncertainty linked to intermediate transcriptional states, not classification noise. Model predictions are aligned with established transcriptomic programs, differentiation markers, and DNA damage repair signatures. By enabling rapid, cost-effective molecular stratification from routine H&E-stained slides, PanSubNet offers a clinically deployable and interpretable tool for genetic subtyping.

Our study investigates the influence of loss-function design on the ability of neural models to predict rare yet critical high-severity fire occurrences. We compare standard cross-entropy with several ordinal-aware objectives, including the proposed probabilistic TDeGPD loss derived from a truncated discrete exponentiated Generalized Pareto Distribution. Through extensive benchmarking over multiple architectures and real operational data, we show that ordinal supervision substantially improves model performance over conventional approaches. In particular, the Weighted Kappa Loss (WKLoss) achieves the best overall results, with more than +0.1 IoU gain on the most extreme severity classes while maintaining competitive calibration quality. However, performance remains limited for the rarest events due to their extremely low representation in the dataset. These findings highlight the importance of integrating both severity ordering, data imbalance considerations, and seasonality risk into wildfire forecasting systems.

Today, cell (re)selection parameters are typically configured manually based on operator experience and rarely adapted to dynamic network conditions. In this work, we ask: Can an agent automatically learn and adapt cell (re)selection parameters to consistently improve network performance? We present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework called CellPilot that adaptively tunes cell (re)selection parameters by learning spatiotemporal patterns of mobile network dynamics. Our study with real-world data demonstrates that even a lightweight RL agent can outperform conventional heuristic reconfigurations by up to 167%, while generalizing effectively across different network scenarios.

By utilizing EVs as flexible energy reservoirs, buildings can dynamically charge and discharge them to optimize energy use and cut costs under time-variable pricing and demand charge policies. This setup leads to the V2B optimization problem, where buildings coordinate EV charging and discharging to minimize total electricity costs while meeting users' charging requirements. However, the V2B optimization problem is challenging because of: (1) fluctuating electricity pricing, which includes both energy charges ($/kWh) and demand charges ($/kW); (2) long planning horizons (typically over 30 days); (3) heterogeneous chargers with varying charging rates, controllability, and directionality (i.e., unidirectional or bidirectional); and (4) user-specific battery levels at departure to ensure user requirements are met. In contrast to existing approaches that often model this setting as a single-shot combinatorial optimization problem, we highlight critical limitations in prior work and instead model the V2B optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), i.e., a stochastic control process. Solving the resulting MDP is challenging due to the large state and action spaces. To address the challenges of the large state space, we leverage online search, and we counter the action space by using domain-specific heuristics to prune unpromising actions. We validate our approach in collaboration with Nissan Advanced Technology Center - Silicon Valley. Using data from their EV testbed, we show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Compared with labor-intensive per-model on-device calibration, a digital-twin pipeline built on optical simulation offers a substantial advantage in generating large-scale labeled data. However, complex imaging conditions induce a domain gap between simulation and real-world images, limiting the generalization of simulation-trained models. To address this, we propose augmenting a simulation baseline with minimal unlabeled real-world images captured at random misalignment positions, mitigating the gap from a domain adaptation perspective. We introduce Domain Adaptive Active Alignment (DA3), which utilizes an autoregressive domain transformation generator and an adversarial-based feature alignment strategy to distill real-world domain information via self-supervised learning. This enables the extraction of domain-invariant image degradation features to facilitate robust misalignment prediction. Experiments on two lens types reveal that DA3 improves accuracy by 46% over a purely simulation pipeline. Notably, it approaches the performance achieved with precisely labeled real-world data collected on 3 lens samples, while reducing on-device data collection time by 98.7%. The results demonstrate that domain adaptation effectively endows simulation-trained models with robust real-world performance, validating the digital-twin pipeline as a practical solution to significantly enhance the efficiency of large-scale optical assembly.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Crucially, can VLMs detect when a reasoning process is wrong and identify its error type? To answer this, we present MMErroR, a multi-modal benchmark of 2,013 samples, each embedding a single coherent reasoning error. These samples span 24 subdomains across six top-level domains, ensuring broad coverage and taxonomic richness. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on answer correctness, MMErroR targets a process-level, error-centric evaluation that requires models to detect incorrect reasoning and classify the error type within both visual and linguistic contexts. We evaluate 20 advanced VLMs, even the best model (Gemini-3.0-Pro) classifies the error in only 66.47\\% of cases, underscoring the challenge of identifying erroneous reasoning. Furthermore, the ability to accurately identify errors offers valuable insights into the capabilities of multi-modal reasoning models.

However, whether LFMs can provide truly personalized treatment recommendations remains an open question. Recent research has revealed multiple challenges for personalization, including the fundamental generalizability paradox: models achieving high accuracy in one clinical study perform at chance level in others, demonstrating that personalization and external validity exist in tension. This exemplifies broader contradictions in AI-driven healthcare: the privacy-performance paradox, scale-specificity paradox, and the automation-empathy paradox. As another challenge, the degree of causal understanding required for personalized recommendations, as opposed to mere predictive capacities of LFMs, remains an open question. N-of-1 trials -- crossover self-experiments and the gold standard for individual causal inference in personalized medicine -- resolve these tensions by providing within-person causal evidence while preserving privacy through local experimentation. Despite their impressive capabilities, this paper argues that LFMs cannot replace N-of-1 trials. We argue that LFMs and N-of-1 trials are complementary: LFMs excel at rapid hypothesis generation from population patterns using multimodal data, while N-of-1 trials excel at causal validation for a given individual. We propose a hybrid framework that combines the strengths of both to enable personalization and navigate the identified paradoxes: LFMs generate ranked intervention candidates with uncertainty estimates, which trigger subsequent N-of-1 trials. Clarifying the boundary between prediction and causation and explicitly addressing the paradoxical tensions are essential for responsible AI integration in personalized medicine.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u5927\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b(LFMs)\u5728\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51faLFMs\u4e0eN-of-1\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3AI\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u91cd\u6096\u8bba\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u5927\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u7597AI\u9886\u57df\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u771f\u6b63\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u5efa\u8bae\u4ecd\u5b58\u7591\u95ee\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u666e\u904d\u6027\u6096\u8bba\u3001\u9690\u79c1-\u6027\u80fd\u6096\u8bba\u3001\u89c4\u6a21-\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6096\u8bba\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316-\u540c\u7406\u5fc3\u6096\u8bba\u7b49\u591a\u91cd\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e34\u5e8a\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u5de8\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faLFMs\u4e0eN-of-1\u8bd5\u9a8c\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff1aLFMs\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u4ece\u7fa4\u4f53\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e2d\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6210\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u5019\u9009\u65b9\u6848(\u542b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1)\uff0c\u968f\u540e\u89e6\u53d1N-of-1\u8bd5\u9a8c(\u4ea4\u53c9\u81ea\u6211\u5b9e\u9a8c)\u8fdb\u884c\u4e2a\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bba\u8bc1\u4e86LFMs\u65e0\u6cd5\u66ff\u4ee3N-of-1\u8bd5\u9a8c\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3aLFMs\u66f4\u64c5\u957f\u57fa\u4e8e\u7fa4\u4f53\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u5047\u8bbe\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u800cN-of-1\u8bd5\u9a8c\u662f\u4e2a\u4eba\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u91d1\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u4e24\u8005\u4e92\u8865\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u533b\u7597\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u660e\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u79ef\u6781\u5e94\u5bf9AI\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u6096\u8bba\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u5730\u5c06AI\u6574\u5408\u5230\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002LFMs\u4e0eN-of-1\u8bd5\u9a8c\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6311\u6218\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

The traditional algorithm to stabilize the beam applies singular value decomposition (SVD) on the orbit response matrix to remove noise and extract actions. Supervised learning has been studied on NSLS-II storage ring stabilization and other accelerator facilities recently. Several problems, for example, machine status drifting, environment noise, and non-linear accelerator dynamics, remain unresolved in the SVD-based and supervised learning algorithms. To address these problems, we propose an adaptive training framework based on model-based reinforcement learning. This framework consists of two types of optimizations: trajectory optimization attempts to minimize the expected total reward in a differentiable environment, and online model optimization learns non-linear machine dynamics through the agent-environment interaction. Through online training, this framework tracks the internal status drifting in the electron beam ring. Simulation and real in-facility experiments on NSLS-II reveal that our method stabilizes the beam position and minimizes the alignment error, defined as the root mean square (RMS) error between adjusted beam positions and the reference position, down to ~1$\u03bc$m.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9488\u5bf9NSLS-II\u540c\u6b65\u8f90\u5c04\u5149\u6e90\u7684\u7535\u5b50\u675f\u8f68\u9053\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfSVD\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5e94\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u72b6\u6001\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u73af\u5883\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u5206\u89e3(SVD)\u7684\u8f68\u9053\u54cd\u5e94\u77e9\u9635\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd1\u5e74\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5e94\u5bf9NSLS-II\u5b58\u50a8\u73af\u7684\u673a\u5668\u72b6\u6001\u6f02\u79fb\u3001\u73af\u5883\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9002\u5e94\u5b9e\u9645\u8fd0\u884c\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\uff1a\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u671f\u671b\u603b\u5956\u52b1\uff1b\u5728\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u901a\u8fc7\u667a\u80fd\u4f53-\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u5b66\u4e60\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u673a\u5668\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7535\u5b50\u675f\u73af\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728NSLS-II\u4e0a\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u8bbe\u65bd\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7a33\u5b9a\u675f\u6d41\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8c03\u6574\u540e\u675f\u6d41\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u53c2\u8003\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bef\u5dee\uff08\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee\uff09\u964d\u4f4e\u81f3\u7ea61\u5fae\u7c73\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u8fd0\u884c\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347NSLS-II\u540c\u6b65\u8f90\u5c04\u5149\u6e90\u7684\u675f\u6d41\u8f68\u9053\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u52a0\u901f\u5668\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A major challenge is to relight the avatars to match any scene illumination. For high quality relighting, existing methods require subjects to be captured under complex time-multiplexed illumination, such as one-light-at-a-time (OLAT). We propose a new generalized relightable 3D Gaussian head model that can relight any subject observed in a single- or multi-view images without requiring OLAT data for that subject. Our core idea is to learn a mapping from flat-lit 3DGS avatars to corresponding relightable Gaussian parameters for that avatar. Our model consists of two stages: a first stage that models flat-lit 3DGS avatars without OLAT lighting, and a second stage that learns the mapping to physically-based reflectance parameters for high-quality relighting. This two-stage design allows us to train the first stage across diverse existing multi-view datasets without OLAT lighting ensuring cross-subject generalization, where we learn a dataset-specific lighting code for self-supervised lighting alignment. Subsequently, the second stage can be trained on a significantly smaller dataset of subjects captured under OLAT illumination. Together, this allows our method to generalize well and relight any subject from the first stage as if we had captured them under OLAT lighting. Furthermore, we can fit our model to unseen subjects from as little as a single image, allowing several applications in novel view synthesis and relighting for digital avatars.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u590d\u6742\u7167\u660e\u91c7\u96c6\u6570\u636e\u7684\u901a\u7528\u53ef\u91cd\u5149\u71673D\u9ad8\u65af\u5934\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u56fe\u6216\u591a\u56fe\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u865a\u62df\u4eba\u5934\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u590d\u6742\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u7528\u7167\u660e\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982OLAT\uff09\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u4ece\u666e\u901a\u5355\u56fe\u6216\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u8f93\u5165\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u4efb\u610f\u5934\u50cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e73\u5766\u7167\u660e\u4e0b\u76843DGS\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5149\u7167\u7f16\u7801\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21OLAT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u5e73\u5766\u7167\u660e\u9ad8\u65af\u53c2\u6570\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u53cd\u5c04\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u5934\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u91cd\u5149\u7167\uff0c\u4e14\u4ec5\u9700\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u5373\u53ef\u62df\u5408\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u5934\u50cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u7167\u660e\u91c7\u96c6\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ec5\u9700\u666e\u901a\u56fe\u50cf\u5373\u53ef\u521b\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u53ef\u91cd\u5149\u7167\u6570\u5b57\u5934\u50cf\u7684\u901a\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This design can be accurate and interpretable, but it makes inference expensive on CPU because each layer requires many spline evaluations. Standard quantization toolchains are also hard to apply because the main computation is not a matrix multiply but repeated spline basis evaluation. This paper introduces LUT-KAN, a segment-wise lookup-table (LUT) compilation and quantization method for PyKAN-style KAN layers. LUT-KAN converts each edge function into a per-segment LUT with affine int8/uint8 quantization and linear interpolation. The method provides an explicit and reproducible inference contract, including boundary conventions and out-of-bounds (OOB) policies. We propose an ``honest baseline'' methodology for speed evaluation: B-spline evaluation and LUT evaluation are compared under the same backend optimization (NumPy vs NumPy and Numba vs Numba), which separates representation gains from vectorization and JIT effects. Experiments include controlled sweeps over LUT resolution L in 16, 32, 64, 128 and two quantization schemes (symmetric int8 and asymmetric uint8). We report accuracy, speed, and memory metrics with mean and standard deviation across multiple seeds. A two-by-two OOB robustness matrix evaluates behavior under different boundary modes and OOB policies. In a case study, we compile a trained KAN model for DoS attack detection (CICIDS2017 pipeline) into LUT artifacts. The compiled model preserves classification quality (F1 drop below 0.0002) while reducing steady-state CPU inference latency by 12x under NumPy and 10x under Numba backends (honest baseline).

This paper introduces Guardians of the Hair (HairGuard), a framework designed to recover fine-grained soft boundary details in 3D vision tasks. Specifically, we first propose a novel data curation pipeline that leverages image matting datasets for training and design a depth fixer network to automatically identify soft boundary regions. With a gated residual module, the depth fixer refines depth precisely around soft boundaries while maintaining global depth quality, allowing plug-and-play integration with state-of-the-art depth models. For view synthesis, we perform depth-based forward warping to retain high-fidelity textures, followed by a generative scene painter that fills disoccluded regions and eliminates redundant background artifacts within soft boundaries. Finally, a color fuser adaptively combines warped and inpainted results to produce novel views with consistent geometry and fine-grained details.

Recent research has attempted to improve safety by training models to reason over safety rules before responding.

The effective CO2 emission reduction depends on the relative capacity of the energy storage and renewable sources, the stochasticity of the renewable generation, and the optimal control or dispatch of the isolated energy system. While the operations of the energy storage and dispatchable sources may impact the optimal sizing of the system, it is challenging to account for the effect of finite horizon, optimal control at the stage of system sizing. Here, we present a flexible and computationally efficient sizing framework for energy storage and renewable capacity in isolated energy systems, accounting for uncertainty in the renewable generation and the optimal feedback control. To this end, we implement an imitation learning approach to stochastic neural model predictive control (MPC) which allows us to relate the battery storage and wind peak capacities to the emissions reduction and investment costs while accounting for finite horizon, optimal control. Through this approach, decision makers can evaluate the effective emission reduction and costs of different storage and wind capacities at any price point while accounting for uncertainty in the renewable generation with limited foresight. We evaluate the proposed sizing framework on a case study of an offshore energy system with a gas turbine, a wind farm and a battery energy storage system (BESS).

Therefore, the objective of this work is to derive simplified LTES unit models for use in system models. In transient simulations the state of charge of the LTES influences its temperature profile. The temperature profile depends on the geometry of the LTES unit. Therefore, the geometry must be considered to model the transient behavior of an LTES unit. The LTES unit under investigation has a shell and tube heat exchanger structure. The phase change material (PCM) is located between the hexagonal fins and in the space between the finned tubes. Aluminum fins are used. They have a high thermal conductivity and thus compensate for the low thermal conductivity of the sodium nitrate used as PCM. The interaction between fins and PCM is complex. Therefore, a numerical approach can be used to gain insight into the behavior of the LTES unit. To transfer the results of a complex model to a simplified model where fins and PCM are not considered individually, the effective thermal conductivity of a single finned tube can be used to approximate the performance of the LTES unit. In this study, a model of a section with a single finned tube is developed using the COMSOL software. The effective thermal conductivity of the system is determined by varying the effective thermal conductivity in a simplified model and comparing the results with reference cases based on a complex modeling approach. The results can serve as model input for simplified system models of Carnot Batteries, among others.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We propose visual word puzzles as a challenging alternative, as they require discovering implicit visual cues, generating and revising hypotheses, and mapping perceptual evidence to non-literal concepts in ways that are difficult to solve via literal grounding, OCR-heavy shortcuts, or simple retrieval-style matching. We introduce Eye-Q, a multilingual benchmark designed to assess this form of complex visual understanding. Eye-Q contains 1,343 puzzles in which a model observes a conceptually dense scene with a brief description and must infer a specific target word or phrase. The puzzles are intentionally unstructured and cue-implicit, with distractors and contextual relationships that demand selective attention, abstraction, and associative inference. The benchmark spans English, Persian, Arabic, and cross-lingual puzzles. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs using an open-ended, human-aligned protocol that probes hypothesis formation and revision under lightweight assistance. Results reveal substantial performance gaps, especially on abstract and cross-lingual puzzles, highlighting limitations in current models' ability to construct and search over appropriate conceptual representations for flexible image-to-phrase inference; maximum accuracy reaches only 60.27%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u8c1c\u8bed\u4efb\u52a1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8c1c\u8bed\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u6700\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec560.27%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5f80\u5f80\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8868\u9762\u8bc6\u522b\u800c\u975e\u6df1\u5c42\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5bcc\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEye-Q\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b1,343\u4e2a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u89c6\u89c9\u8c1c\u8bed\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u6a21\u578b\u89c2\u5bdf\u6982\u5ff5\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u573a\u666f\u5e76\u63a8\u65ad\u76ee\u6807\u5355\u8bcd\u6216\u77ed\u8bed\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5f00\u653e\u5f0f\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5728\u8f7b\u5ea6\u534f\u52a9\u4e0b\u63a2\u6d4b\u5047\u8bbe\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u4fee\u6b63\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u8de8\u8bed\u8a00\u8c1c\u8bed\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u9002\u5f53\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u793a\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u7075\u6d3b\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u77ed\u8bed\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8c1c\u8bed\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6df1\u5c42\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fd9\u7c7b\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4ecd\u6709\u660e\u663e\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u8fdb\u6982\u5ff5\u8868\u793a\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Currently, reasoning strategies are autonomously selected by LRMs themselves. However, such autonomous selection often produces inefficient or even erroneous reasoning paths. To make reasoning more reliable and flexible, it is important to develop methods for controlling reasoning strategies. Existing methods struggle to control fine-grained reasoning strategies due to conceptual entanglement in LRMs' hidden states. To address this, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose strategy-entangled hidden states into a disentangled feature space. To identify the few strategy-specific features from the vast pool of SAE features, we propose SAE-Steering, an efficient two-stage feature identification pipeline. SAE-Steering first recalls features that amplify the logits of strategy-specific keywords, filtering out over 99\\% of features, and then ranks the remaining features by their control effectiveness. Using the identified strategy-specific features as control vectors, SAE-Steering outperforms existing methods by over 15\\% in control effectiveness. Furthermore, controlling reasoning strategies can redirect LRMs from erroneous paths to correct ones, achieving a 7\\% absolute accuracy improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSAE-Steering\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u89e3\u8026\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u76ee\u524d\u81ea\u4e3b\u9009\u62e9\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u4f4e\u6548\u751a\u81f3\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u89e3\u8026\u7b56\u7565\u7ea0\u7f20\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u63d0\u51faSAE-Steering\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7279\u5f81\u8bc6\u522b\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u7b56\u7565\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7279\u5f81\u7b5b\u900999%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u518d\u6309\u63a7\u5236\u6548\u679c\u6392\u5e8f\u3002", "result": "SAE-Steering\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u6548\u679c\u4e0a\u8d85\u8fc7\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd515%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u53ef\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u9519\u8bef\u8def\u5f84\u5f15\u5bfc\u81f3\u6b63\u786e\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b07%\u7684\u7edd\u5bf9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "SAE-Steering\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5927\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Since periodic references have more complex dynamics, it is more challenging to track periodic references and achieve consensus on them. In this paper, a model predictive control method incorporating an artificial reference and a modified cost is proposed to track periodic references, which maintains recursive feasibility even when reference switches. Moreover, consensus protocols are proposed to achieve consensus on periodic references in different scenarios, in which global information such as the set of globally admissible references and the global time index are not involved. Theoretical analysis proves that constrained output consensus is asymptotically achieved with the proposed algorithm as the references of each agent converge and agents track their references while maintaining constraint satisfaction.

Previous work has shown that increasing inference steps can disrupt safety mechanisms and lead MLLMs to generate attacker-desired harmful content. However, most existing attacks focus on increasing the complexity of the modified visual task itself and do not explicitly leverage the model's own reasoning incentives. This leads to them underperforming on reasoning models (Models with Chain-of-Thoughts) compared to non-reasoning ones (Models without Chain-of-Thoughts). If a model can think like a human, can we influence its cognitive-stage decisions so that it proactively completes a jailbreak? To validate this idea, we propose GAMBI} (Gamified Adversarial Multimodal Breakout via Instructional Traps), a novel multimodal jailbreak framework that decomposes and reassembles harmful visual semantics, then constructs a gamified scene that drives the model to explore, reconstruct intent, and answer as part of winning the game. The resulting structured reasoning chain increases task complexity in both vision and text, positioning the model as a participant whose goal pursuit reduces safety attention and induces it to answer the reconstructed malicious query. Extensive experiments on popular reasoning and non-reasoning MLLMs demonstrate that GAMBIT achieves high Attack Success Rates (ASR), reaching 92.13% on Gemini 2.5 Flash, 91.20% on QvQ-MAX, and 85.87% on GPT-4o, significantly outperforming baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aGAMBIT\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u9677\u9631\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u5bf9\u6297\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7a81\u7834\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8d8a\u72f1\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u91cd\u7ec4\u6709\u5bb3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u573a\u666f\u6765\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u91cd\u6784\u610f\u56fe\u5e76\u56de\u7b54\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6210\u529f\u8bf1\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u54cd\u5e94\u6076\u610f\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u975e\u63a8\u7406MLLMs\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u4fee\u6539\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u6765\u7834\u574f\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u672a\u663e\u5f0f\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a8\u673a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u6548\u679c\u660e\u663e\u4e0d\u5982\u975e\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u7591\u95ee\uff1a\u5982\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u50cf\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e00\u6837\u601d\u8003\uff0c\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u8ba4\u77e5\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u6765\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b8c\u6210\u8d8a\u72f1\uff1f\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8fd9\u4e00\u60f3\u6cd5\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GAMBIT\u6846\u67b6\uff1a(1) \u5206\u89e3\u548c\u91cd\u7ec4\u6709\u5bb3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\uff1b(2) \u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u63a2\u7d22\u5e76\u91cd\u6784\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u7684\u610f\u56fe\uff1b(3) \u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8ffd\u6c42\u6e38\u620f\u80dc\u5229\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u56de\u7b54\u91cd\u6784\u540e\u7684\u6076\u610f\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u975e\u63a8\u7406MLLMs\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eGAMBIT\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u5f88\u9ad8\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff08ASR\uff09\uff1a\u5728Gemini 2.5 Flash\u4e0a\u4e3a92.13%\uff0c\u5728QvQ-MAX\u4e0a\u4e3a91.20%\uff0c\u5728GPT-4o\u4e0a\u4e3a85.87%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GAMBIT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u6fc0\u52b1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6e38\u620f\u5316\u573a\u666f\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u52a8\u89e3\u51b3\u7531\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u91cd\u6784\u7684\u6076\u610f\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6709\u6548\u7834\u574f\u4e86\u73b0\u6709MLLMs\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u6297\u63aa\u65bd\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u6210\u679c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

Better cutting parameters can be achieved considering surface location error (SLE) together with SLD. This paper proposes an innovative modeling framework of the machining dynamic system that enables efficient computation of the chatter stability and SLE. The framework mainly embodies two techniques, namely semi-discretization method (SDM) and lifting method. The machining dynamics system is mathematically expressed as an angle-varying delay differential equation (DDE). The SDM approximates the angle-varying and delayed terms to ordinary terms using zero-phase interpolations and governs the discrete angle-varying dynamics system. Then, the system is merged over the tooth passing angle using the lifted approach to establish an explicit dynamic system in the compact state-space form. Based on the compact state-space model, the chatter stability and SLE prediction are easily and efficiently conducted. Simulation results show the improved efficiency of the proposed method over other well-known methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We also introduce a comprehensive waterhemp dataset containing 10,264 annotated frames from 23 plants. On this benchmark, WeedRepFormer achieves 92.18% mIoU for segmentation and 81.91% accuracy for gender classification using only 3.59M parameters and 3.80 GFLOPs.

We focus on Agentic Communities - coordination frameworks encompassing LLM Agents, Agentic AI entities, and humans - most relevant for enterprise and industrial applications. Drawing on established coordination principles from distributed systems, we ground these patterns in a formal framework that specifies collaboration agreements where AI agents and humans fill roles within governed ecosystems. This approach provides both practical guidance and formal verification capabilities, enabling expression of organizational, legal, and ethical rules through accountability mechanisms that ensure operational and verifiable governance of inter-agent communication, negotiation, and intent modeling.

The common practice of fully fine-tuning the vision encoder on driving datasets potentially limits its generalization by causing the model to specialize too heavily in the training data. This work challenges the necessity of this training paradigm. We propose FROST-Drive, a novel E2E architecture designed to preserve and leverage the powerful generalization capabilities of a pretrained vision encoder from a Vision-Language Model (VLM). By keeping the encoder's weights frozen, our approach directly transfers the rich, generalized world knowledge from the VLM to the driving task. Our model architecture combines this frozen encoder with a transformer-based adapter for multimodal fusion and a GRU-based decoder for smooth waypoint generation. Furthermore, we introduce a custom loss function designed to directly optimize for Rater Feedback Score (RFS), a metric that prioritizes robust trajectory planning. We conduct extensive experiments on Waymo Open E2E Dataset, a large-scale datasets deliberately curated to capture the long-tail scenarios, demonstrating that our frozen-encoder approach significantly outperforms models that employ full fine-tuning. Our results provide substantial evidence that preserving the broad knowledge of a capable VLM is a more effective strategy for achieving robust, generalizable driving performance than intensive domain-specific adaptation.

An Entropy-based Safety Reminder for LRMs", "comment": null, "summary": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve remarkable success through explicit thinking steps, yet the thinking steps introduce a novel risk by potentially amplifying unsafe behaviors. Despite this vulnerability, conventional defense mechanisms remain ineffective as they overlook the unique reasoning dynamics of LRMs. In this work, we find that the emergence of safe-reminding phrases within thinking steps plays a pivotal role in ensuring LRM safety.

(1) Models undergoing specific curriculum transitions (e.g., code-to-chat) show an English-only, syntax-triggered connectivity failure on non-canonical constructions, reaching $\u0394\u03bb_2 \\approx -0.76$. We term this scar \\textit{Passive-Triggered Connectivity Collapse} (PTCC). Analysis of the Phi lineage reveals that PTCC appears and resolves across developmental stages, implicating brittle curriculum shifts rather than synthetic data per se. (2) PTCC reflects a specialization trade-off: strengthened formal routing at the expense of stylistic flexibility. (3) We identify four recurrent processing strategies; simple frozen-threshold rules enable perfect forensic identification across lineages. (4) Mechanistically, PTCC localizes to a sparse Layer 2 ``compensatory patch'' of heads that fails under syntactic stress; activation steering can partially restore connectivity, recovering $\\approx 38\\%$ of lost information flow.\n  Finally, dominant topological regimes track tokenization density more than language identity, suggesting ``healthy'' geometry varies systematically across scripts.

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves accuracy but incurs prohibitive latency for real-time query correction. A potential solution is to output an answer before reasoning to reduce latency; however, under autoregressive decoding, the early answer is independent of subsequent reasoning, preventing the model from leveraging its reasoning capability to improve accuracy. To address this issue, we propose Sandwich Reasoning (SandwichR), a novel approach that explicitly aligns a fast initial answer with post-hoc reasoning, enabling low-latency query correction without sacrificing reasoning-aware accuracy. SandwichR follows an Answer-Reasoning-Answer paradigm, producing an initial correction, an explicit reasoning process, and a final refined correction. To align the initial answer with post-reasoning insights, we design a consistency-aware reinforcement learning (RL) strategy: a dedicated consistency reward enforces alignment between the initial and final corrections, while margin-based rejection sampling prioritizes borderline samples where reasoning drives the most impactful corrective gains. Additionally, we construct a high-quality query correction dataset, addressing the lack of specialized benchmarks for complex query correction. Experimental results demonstrate that SandwichR achieves SOTA accuracy comparable to standard CoT while delivering a 40-70% latency reduction, resolving the latency-accuracy trade-off in online search.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Across three representative models and the MMLU benchmark, we uncover a domain-invariant Standing Committee. This is a compact coalition of routed experts that consistently captures the majority of routing mass across domains, layers, and routing budgets, even when architectures already include shared experts. Qualitative analysis further shows that Standing Committees anchor reasoning structure and syntax, while peripheral experts handle domain-specific knowledge. These findings reveal a strong structural bias toward centralized computation, suggesting that specialization in Mixture of Experts models is far less pervasive than commonly believed.

Previous work successfully demonstrated that automated planners, using general domain-independent heuristics, are able to generate personalized treatments, when the domain and problems are modeled using a general domain description language (\\pddlp). Unfortunately, this process was limited in practice to consider no more than seven medications. In clinical terms, this is a non-starter. In this paper, we explore the use of automatically-generated domain- and problem-specific heuristics to be used with general search, as a method of scaling up medication planning to levels allowing closer work with clinicians. Specifically, we specify the domain programmatically (specifying an initial state and a successor generation procedure), and use an LLM to generate a problem specific heuristic that can be used by a fixed search algorithm (GBFS). The results indicate dramatic improvements in coverage and planning time, scaling up the number of medications to at least 28, and bringing medication planning one step closer to practical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In recent years, there have been significant advances in evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for news video understanding. However, existing benchmarks largely focus on single-source, intra-video reasoning, where each report is processed in isolation. In contrast, real-world news consumption is inherently multi-sourced: the same event is reported by different outlets with complementary details, distinct narrative choices, and sometimes conflicting claims that unfold over time. Robust news understanding, therefore, requires models to compare perspectives from different sources, align multimodal evidence across sources, and synthesize multi-source information. To fill this gap, we introduce VNU-Bench, the first benchmark for multi-source, cross-video understanding in the news domain. We design a set of new question types that are unique in testing models' ability of understanding multi-source multimodal news from a variety of different angles. We design a novel hybrid human-model QA generation process that addresses the issues of scalability and quality control in building a large dataset for cross-source news understanding. The dataset comprises 429 news groups, 1,405 videos, and 2,501 high-quality questions.

This allows the use of a very simple control, avoiding the implementation of Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithms that require lossy microcontrollers. Thus, the proposed interface is equipped with a simple analog controller allowing the RPVEH to work in its Maximum Power Point (MPP) in both steady-state and variable conditions of vibrations, without recurring to multivariable perturbative approaches, as it happens for the most of single stage AC/DC interfaces proposed in the literature.

Reinforcement learning (RL) has been investigated for improving the quality of image editing, but it faces three key challenges: (1) limited reasoning exploration confined to denoising stochasticity, (2) biased reward fusion, and (3) unstable VLM-based instruction rewards. In this work, we propose ThinkRL-Edit, a reasoning-centric RL framework that decouples visual reasoning from image synthesis and expands reasoning exploration beyond denoising. To the end, we introduce Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based reasoning sampling with planning and reflection stages prior to generation in online sampling, compelling the model to explore multiple semantic hypotheses and validate their plausibility before committing to a visual outcome. To avoid the failures of weighted aggregation, we propose an unbiased chain preference grouping strategy across multiple reward dimensions. Moreover, we replace interval-based VLM scores with a binary checklist, yielding more precise, lower-variance, and interpretable rewards for complex reasoning.

We study budgeted inference-time reasoning for multiple tasks under a strict global token constraint and formalize it as a Ordered Stochastic Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem(OS-MCKP). This perspective highlights a meta-cognitive requirement -- anticipating task difficulty, estimating return over investment (ROI), and allocating computation strategically. We propose ROI-Reasoning, a two-stage framework that endows LLMs with intrinsic, budget-aware rationality. In the first stage, Meta-Cognitive Fine-Tuning teaches models to predict reasoning cost and expected utility before generation, enabling explicit solve-or-skip decisions. Next, Rationality-Aware Reinforcement Learning optimizes sequential decision making under a hard token budget, allowing models to learn long-horizon allocation strategies. Across budgeted mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ROI-Reasoning consistently improves overall score while substantially reducing regret under tight computation budgets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Previous studies have employed machine learning and deep learning techniques, which often result in low feature optimization, thereby compromising both high performance and interpretability. To fill these voids, this paper proposes a hybrid approach to driver behavior analysis that uses a 12,857-row and 18-column data set taken from Kaggle. After applying preprocessing techniques such as label encoding, random oversampling, and standard scaling, 13 machine learning algorithms were tested. The Random Forest Classifier achieved an accuracy of 95%.

While existing research focuses on mitigating language priors or high-level statistical biases, they often overlook the internal complexities of the visual encoding process. We identify that visual statistical bias, arising from the inherent Bag-of-Patches behavior of Vision Encoders under weak structural supervision, acts as a contributing factor of object hallucinations. Under this bias, models prioritize local texture features within individual patches over holistic geometric structures. This tendency may induce spurious visual confidence and result in hallucinations. To address this, we introduce a training-free algorithm called Structure-Disrupted Contrastive Decoding (SDCD), which performs contrastive calibration of the output distribution by introducing a shuffled structure-disrupted view. By penalizing tokens that maintain high confidence under this structure-less view, SDCD effectively suppresses the texture-driven bias. Experimental results demonstrate that SDCD significantly mitigates hallucinations across multiple benchmarks and enhances the overall multimodal capabilities of LVLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684SDCD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u6253\u4e71\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u6765\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u7eb9\u7406\u504f\u597d\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5927\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u8bed\u8a00\u5148\u9a8c\u6216\u9ad8\u5c42\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u5f31\u7ed3\u6784\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u201cBag-of-Patches\u201d\u884c\u4e3a\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c6\u89c9\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c40\u90e8\u7eb9\u7406\u7279\u5f81\u800c\u975e\u6574\u4f53\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStructure-Disrupted Contrastive Decoding (SDCD)\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u521b\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u6253\u4e71\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u89c6\u56fe\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u6253\u4e71\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u987a\u5e8f\uff09\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6b63\u5e38\u89c6\u56fe\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u6253\u4e71\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u60e9\u7f5a\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u7f3a\u5931\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684token\uff1b3) \u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6821\u51c6\u8f93\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aSDCD\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u603b\u4f53\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u7edf\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\u662f\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u6253\u4e71\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u7eb9\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4e3a\u7f13\u89e3\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To solidify the consistency between partial success and end-to-end functional correctness, VeRPO further integrates the dense signal with global execution outcomes, establishing a robust and dense reward paradigm relying solely on verifiable execution feedback.

Our G2P address the misalignment between optimized Gaussians and original point geometry by establishing point-wise correspondences. By leveraging Gaussian opacity attributes, we resolve the geometric ambiguity that limits existing models.

Among other things, explainablility for deep neural networks has been a topic of intensive research due to the meteoric rise in prominence of deep neural networks and their \"black-box\" nature. xAI approaches can be characterized along different dimensions such as their scope (global versus local explanations) or underlying methodologies (statistic-based versus rule-based strategies). Methods generating global explanations aim to provide reasoning process applicable to all possible output classes while local explanation methods focus only on a single, specific class. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a well-known statistical technique, identifies important features of a network. Deep neural network rule extraction method constructs IF-THEN rules that link input conditions to a class. Another approach focuses on generating counterfactuals which help explain how small changes to an input can affect the model's predictions. However, these techniques primarily focus on the input-output relationship and thus neglect the structure of the network in explanation generation.   In this work, we propose xDNN(ASP), an explanation generation system for deep neural networks that provides global explanations. Given a neural network model and its training data, xDNN(ASP) extracts a logic program under answer set semantics that-in the ideal case-represents the trained model, i.e., answer sets of the extracted program correspond one-to-one to input-output pairs of the network. We demonstrate experimentally, using two synthetic datasets, that not only the extracted logic program maintains a high-level of accuracy in the prediction task, but it also provides valuable information for the understanding of the model such as the importance of features as well as the impact of hidden nodes on the prediction. The latter can be used as a guide for reducing the number of nodes used in hidden layers, i.e., providing a means for optimizing the network.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Based on DGF, to model biological heterogeneity, we propose Green's-Function Spherical Neural Operator (GSNO) fusing 3 operator solutions: (1) Equivariant Solution derived from Equivariant Green's Function for symmetry-consistent modeling; (2) Invariant Solution derived from Invariant Green's Function to eliminate nuisance heterogeneity, e.g., consistent background field; (3) Anisotropic Solution derived from Anisotropic Green's Function to model anisotropic systems, especially fibers with preferred direction.

This study examines the limitations of existing datasets and emphasizes the temporal characteristics of key features relevant to hypoglycemia prediction. A comprehensive analysis of imputation techniques is conducted, focusing on those employed in state-of-the-art studies. Furthermore, imputation methods derived from machine learning and deep learning applications in other healthcare contexts are evaluated for their potential to address longer gaps in time-series data. Based on this analysis, a systematic paradigm is proposed, wherein imputation strategies are tailored to the nature of specific features and the duration of missing intervals.

However, existing methods typically compress optical features to match thermal feature dimensions for cross-modal alignment and fusion, which not only causes the loss of high-frequency information that is beneficial for thermal super-resolution, but also introduces physically inconsistent artifacts such as texture distortions and edge blurring by overlooking differences in the imaging physics between modalities. To address these challenges, we propose PCNet to achieve cross-resolution mutual enhancement between optical and thermal modalities, while physically constraining the optical guidance process via thermal conduction to enable robust thermal UAV image super-resolution. In particular, we design a Cross-Resolution Mutual Enhancement Module (CRME) to jointly optimize thermal image super-resolution and optical-to-thermal modality conversion, facilitating effective bidirectional feature interaction across resolutions while preserving high-frequency optical priors. Moreover, we propose a Physics-Driven Thermal Conduction Module (PDTM) that incorporates two-dimensional heat conduction into optical guidance, modeling spatially-varying heat conduction properties to prevent inconsistent artifacts. In addition, we introduce a temperature consistency loss that enforces regional distribution consistency and boundary gradient smoothness to ensure generated thermal images align with real-world thermal radiation principles.

Generative world models offer a promising remedy: agents could use them as external simulators to foresee outcomes before acting. This paper empirically examines whether current agents can leverage such world models as tools to enhance their cognition. Across diverse agentic and visual question answering tasks, we observe that some agents rarely invoke simulation (fewer than 1%), frequently misuse predicted rollouts (approximately 15%), and often exhibit inconsistent or even degraded performance (up to 5%) when simulation is available or enforced. Attribution analysis further indicates that the primary bottleneck lies in the agents' capacity to decide when to simulate, how to interpret predicted outcomes, and how to integrate foresight into downstream reasoning.

Early and accurate identification of failure zones in landslide-prone areas is crucial for effective geohazard mitigation. While existing approaches typically rely on surface displacement data analyzed through statistical or machine learning techniques, they often fall short in capturing both the spatial correlations and temporal dynamics that are inherent in such data. To address this gap, we focus on ground-monitored landslides and introduce a novel approach that jointly incorporates spatial and temporal information, enabling the detection of complex landslides and including multiple successive failures occurring in distinct areas of the same slope. To be specific, our method builds upon an existing LID-based technique, known as sLID. We extend its capabilities in three key ways. (1) Kinematic enhancement: we incorporate velocity into the sLID computation to better capture short-term temporal dependencies and deformation rate relationships. (2) Spatial fusion: we apply Bayesian estimation to aggregate sLID values across spatial neighborhoods, effectively embedding spatial correlations into the LID scores.

In this paper, we propose CloudMatch, a semi-supervised framework that effectively leverages unlabeled remote sensing imagery through view-consistency learning combined with scene-mixing augmentations. An observation behind CloudMatch is that cloud patterns exhibit structural diversity and contextual variability across different scenes and within the same scene category. Our key insight is that enforcing prediction consistency across diversely augmented views, incorporating both inter-scene and intra-scene mixing, enables the model to capture the structural diversity and contextual richness of cloud patterns. Specifically, CloudMatch generates one weakly augmented view along with two complementary strongly augmented views for each unlabeled image: one integrates inter-scene patches to simulate contextual variety, while the other employs intra-scene mixing to preserve semantic coherence. This approach guides pseudolabel generation and enhances generalization. Extensive experiments show that CloudMatch achieves good performance, demonstrating its capability to utilize unlabeled data efficiently and advance semi-supervised cloud detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "CloudMatch\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u536b\u661f\u5f71\u50cf\u4e91\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u573a\u666f\u6df7\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\u6765\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e", "motivation": "\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u4e14\u4e91\u6a21\u5f0f\u5177\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u573a\u666f\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u6027\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u65e0\u6807\u6ce8\u9065\u611f\u5f71\u50cf\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd", "method": "\u4e3a\u65e0\u6807\u6ce8\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f31\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u56fe\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u5f3a\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u56fe\uff08\u573a\u666f\u95f4\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u62df\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u573a\u666f\u5185\u6df7\u5408\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3", "result": "CloudMatch\u5728\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u4e91\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u65e0\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u7528\u80fd\u529b", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u56fe\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u573a\u666f\u6df7\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\uff0cCloudMatch\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6355\u83b7\u4e91\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e30\u5bcc\u6027\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u4e91\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55"}}

We explore two reward integration strategies: Fixed-effect Semantic Reward (FSR) for stable alignment signals, and Dynamic-effect Semantic Reward (DSR) for coupled magnitude optimization.

Their core mechanisms, Top-k routing and auxiliary load balancing, remain heuristic, however, lacking a cohesive theoretical underpinning to support them. To this end, we build the first unified theoretical framework that rigorously derives these practices as optimal sparse posterior approximation and prior regularization from a Bayesian perspective, while simultaneously framing them as mechanisms to minimize routing ambiguity and maximize channel capacity from an information-theoretic perspective. We also pinpoint the inherent combinatorial hardness of routing, defining it as the NP-hard sparse subset selection problem. We rigorously prove the existence of a \"Coherence Barrier\"; when expert representations exhibit high mutual coherence, greedy routing strategies theoretically fail to recover the optimal expert subset.

While recent gloss-free SLT methods have made strides in translating manual gestures, they frequently overlook the semantic criticality of facial expressions, resulting in ambiguity when distinct concepts share identical manual articulations. To address this, we present **EASLT** (**E**motion-**A**ware **S**ign **L**anguage **T**ranslation), a framework that treats facial affect not as auxiliary information, but as a robust semantic anchor. Unlike methods that relegate facial expressions to a secondary role, EASLT incorporates a dedicated emotional encoder to capture continuous affective dynamics. These representations are integrated via a novel *Emotion-Aware Fusion* (EAF) module, which adaptively recalibrates spatio-temporal sign features based on affective context to resolve semantic ambiguities. Extensive evaluations on the PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks demonstrate that EASLT establishes advanced performance among gloss-free methods, achieving BLEU-4 scores of 26.15 and 22.80, and BLEURT scores of 61.0 and 57.8, respectively. Ablation studies confirm that explicitly modeling emotion effectively decouples affective semantics from manual dynamics, significantly enhancing translation fidelity.

However, this paradigm incurs substantial deployment costs as models often exhibit excessive verbosity on simple queries. Existing efficient reasoning methods relying on explicit length penalties often introduce optimization conflicts and leave the generative mechanisms driving overthinking largely unexamined. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon termed length shift where models increasingly generate unnecessary reasoning on trivial inputs during training. To address this, we introduce Dynamic Outlier Truncation (DOT), a training-time intervention that selectively suppresses redundant tokens. This method targets only the extreme tail of response lengths within fully correct rollout groups while preserving long-horizon reasoning capabilities for complex problems. To complement this intervention and ensure stable convergence, we further incorporate auxiliary KL regularization and predictive dynamic sampling. Experimental results across multiple model scales demonstrate that our approach significantly pushes the efficiency-performance Pareto frontier outward. Notably, on the AIME-24, our method reduces inference token usage by 78% while simultaneously increasing accuracy compared to the initial policy and surpassing state-of-the-art efficient reasoning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Here, we show that client heterogeneity destabilizes FL primarily by distorting local gradient dynamics during client-side optimization, causing systematic drift that accumulates across communication rounds and impedes global convergence. This observation highlights local gradients as a key regulatory lever for stabilizing heterogeneous FL systems. Building on this insight, we develop a general client-side perspective that regulates local gradient contributions without incurring additional communication overhead. Inspired by swarm intelligence, we instantiate this perspective through Exploratory--Convergent Gradient Re-aggregation (ECGR), which balances well-aligned and misaligned gradient components to preserve informative updates while suppressing destabilizing effects. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, including evaluations on the LC25000 medical imaging dataset, demonstrate that regulating local gradient dynamics consistently stabilizes federated learning across state-of-the-art methods under heterogeneous data distributions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In the coarse stage, we introduce a Bezier Enhanced Object Spatial Encoder (BEOSE) that models spatial relationships at the instance level using quadratic Bezier curves.

However, most existing agents remain reactive, making decisions mainly from current screen, which limits their performance on long-horizon tasks. Building a world model from repeated interactions enables forecasting action outcomes and supports better decision making for mobile GUI agents. This is challenging because the model must predict post-action states with spatial awareness while remaining efficient enough for practical deployment. In this paper, we propose MobileDreamer, an efficient world-model-based lookahead framework to equip the GUI agents based on the future imagination provided by the world model. It consists of textual sketch world model and rollout imagination for GUI agent. Textual sketch world model forecasts post-action states through a learning process to transform digital images into key task-related sketches, and designs a novel order-invariant learning strategy to preserve the spatial information of GUI elements. The rollout imagination strategy for GUI agent optimizes the action-selection process by leveraging the prediction capability of world model.

Existing detection methods mainly detect jailbreak status relying on jailbreak templates present in the training data. However, few studies address the more realistic and challenging zero-shot jailbreak detection setting, where no jailbreak templates are available during training. This setting better reflects real-world scenarios where new attacks continually emerge and evolve. To address this challenge, we propose a layer-wise, module-wise, and token-wise amplification framework that progressively magnifies internal feature discrepancies between benign and jailbreak prompts. We uncover safety-relevant layers, identify specific modules that inherently encode zero-shot discriminative signals, and localize informative safety tokens. Building upon these insights, we introduce ALERT (Amplification-based Jailbreak Detector), an efficient and effective zero-shot jailbreak detector that introduces two independent yet complementary classifiers on amplified representations. Extensive experiments on three safety benchmarks demonstrate that ALERT achieves consistently strong zero-shot detection performance. Specifically, (i) across all datasets and attack strategies, ALERT reliably ranks among the top two methods, and (ii) it outperforms the second-best baseline by at least 10% in average Accuracy and F1-score, and sometimes by up to 40%.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Detecting AI-generated images has thus become a critical challenge, particularly in terms of generalizing to unseen generative models. Existing methods using frozen pre-trained CLIP models show promise in generalization but treat the image encoder as a basic feature extractor, failing to fully exploit its potential. In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of the frozen CLIP image encoder (CLIP-ViT), revealing that it effectively clusters real images in a high-level, abstract feature space. However, it does not truly possess the ability to distinguish between real and AI-generated images. Based on this analysis, we propose a Masking-based Pre-trained model Fine-Tuning (MPFT) strategy, which introduces a Texture-Aware Masking (TAM) mechanism to mask textured areas containing generative model-specific patterns during fine-tuning. This approach compels CLIP-ViT to attend to the \"distributional deviations\"from authentic images for AI-generated image detection, thereby achieving enhanced generalization performance. Extensive experiments on the GenImage and UniversalFakeDetect datasets demonstrate that our method, fine-tuned with only a minimal number of images, significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 98.2% and 94.6% average accuracy on the two datasets, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While most prior studies focus on detection that responds to existing conditions, forecasting mental health enables proactive support through Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive benchmarking study comparing traditional machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and large language model (LLM) approaches for mental health forecasting using the College Experience Sensing (CES) dataset, the most extensive longitudinal dataset of college student mental health to date. We systematically evaluate models across temporal windows, feature granularities, personalization strategies, and class imbalance handling.

Inspired by this question, we introduce SiT-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the SI performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) without pixel-level input, comprises over 3,800 expert-annotated items across five primary categories and 17 subtasks, ranging from egocentric navigation and perspective transformation to fine-grained robotic manipulation. By converting single/multi-view scenes into high-fidelity, coordinate-aware textual descriptions, we challenge LLMs to perform symbolic textual reasoning rather than visual pattern matching. Evaluation results of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveals that while models achieve proficiency in localized semantic tasks, a significant \"spatial gap\" remains in global consistency. Notably, we find that explicit spatial reasoning significantly boosts performance, suggesting that LLMs possess latent world-modeling potential.

However, the affiliated search algorithms often overlook the significant computational costs associated with LM inference, particularly in scenarios with constrained computational budgets. Consequently, we address the problem of improving LM performance on problem-solving tasks under limited computational budgets. We demonstrate how the probabilities assigned to thoughts by LMs can serve as a heuristic to guide search within the ToT framework, thereby reducing the number of thought evaluations. Building on this insight, we adapt a heuristic search algorithm, Levin Tree Search (LTS), to the ToT framework, which leverages LMs as policies to guide the tree exploration efficiently. We extend the theoretical results of LTS by showing that, for ToT (a pruned tree), LTS guarantees a bound on the number of states expanded, and consequently, on the number of thoughts generated. Additionally, we analyze the sensitivity of this bound to the temperature values commonly used in the final softmax layer of the LM. Empirical evaluation under a fixed LM query budget demonstrates that LTS consistently achieves comparable or higher accuracy than baseline search algorithms within the ToT framework, across three domains (Blocksworld, PrOntoQA, Array Sorting) and four distinct LMs. These findings highlight the efficacy of LTS on ToT, particularly in enabling cost-effective and time-efficient problem-solving, making it well-suited for latency-critical and resource-constrained applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5Levin\u6811\u641c\u7d22\uff08LTS\uff09\u6574\u5408\u5230\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684Tree-of-Thoughts\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528LM\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4f5c\u4e3a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5f15\u5bfc\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u601d\u7ef4\u8bc4\u4f30\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Tree-of-Thoughts\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u5ffd\u7565\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347LM\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5c06Levin\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u9002\u914d\u5230Tree-of-Thoughts\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u7528LM\u751f\u6210\u601d\u7ef4\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4f5c\u4e3a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u51fd\u6570\u5f15\u5bfc\u6811\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u5e76\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5728\u526a\u679d\u6811\u72b6\u6001\u4e0bLTS\u6269\u5c55\u72b6\u6001\u6570\u7684\u754c\u9650\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u6e29\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fa\u5b9aLM\u67e5\u8be2\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\uff0cLTS\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u9886\u57df\u548c\u56db\u79cd\u4e0d\u540cLM\u4e0a\uff0c\u59cb\u7ec8\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u641c\u7d22\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "conclusion": "LTS\u5728ToT\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u5408\u5ef6\u8fdf\u654f\u611f\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u7684LM\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, existing studies largely overlook the complex environmental factors encountered in real world scenarios-such as illumination, background, and camera viewpoint-which can substantially increase the difficulty of test images. As a result, models trained under laboratory conditions often fall short of practical deployment requirements. To bridge this gap, in this paper, an environment-robust FSS setting is introduced that explicitly incorporates challenging test cases arising from complex environments-such as motion blur, small objects, and camouflaged targets-to enhance model's robustness under realistic, dynamic conditions. An environment robust FSS benchmark (ER-FSS) is established, covering eight datasets across multiple real world scenarios. In addition, an Adaptive Attention Distillation (AAD) method is proposed, which repeatedly contrasts and distills key shared semantics between known (support) and unknown (query) images to derive class-specific attention for novel categories.

Stone inscription images pose severe challenges for binarization due to poor contrast between etched characters and the stone background, non-uniform surface degradation, distracting artifacts, and highly variable text density and layouts. These conditions frequently cause existing binarization techniques to fail and struggle to isolate coherent character regions. Many approaches sub-divide the image into patches to improve text fragment resolution and improve binarization performance. With this in mind, we present a robust and adaptive patching strategy to binarize challenging Indic inscriptions. The patches from our approach are used to train an Attention U-Net for binarization. The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on subtle structural cues, while our dynamic sampling and patch selection method ensures that the model learns to overcome surface noise and layout irregularities. We also introduce a carefully annotated, pixel-precise dataset of Indic stone inscriptions at the character-fragment level. We demonstrate that our novel patching mechanism significantly boosts binarization performance across classical and deep learning baselines. Despite training only on single script Indic dataset, our model exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to other Indic and non-indic scripts, highlighting its robustness and script-agnostic generalization capabilities. By producing clean, structured representations of inscription content, our method lays the foundation for downstream tasks such as script identification, OCR, and historical text analysis.

This framework enables the operator to inherit the probabilistic structure of the underlying process, making it suitable for modeling and approximating stochastic signals. We establish mean-square convergence of K-SNNOs to the target stochastic process and derive quantitative error estimates expressing the rate of approximation in terms of the modulus of continuity. Numerical simulations further validate the theoretical results by demonstrating accurate reconstruction of sample paths and rapid decay of the mean square error (MSE).

Existing solutions remain limited by long running time or insufficient schedule quality, especially when problem scale increases. In this paper, we propose ReLA, a reinforcement-learning (RL) scheduler built on structured representation learning and aggregation. ReLA first learns diverse representations from scheduling entities, including job operations and machines, using two intra-entity learning modules with self-attention and convolution and one inter-entity learning module with cross-attention. These modules are applied in a multi-scale architecture, and their outputs are aggregated to support RL decision-making. Across experiments on small, medium, and large job instances, ReLA achieves the best makespan in most tested settings over the latest solutions. On non-large instances, ReLA reduces the optimality gap of the SOTA baseline by 13.0%, while on large-scale instances it reduces the gap by 78.6%, with the average optimality gaps lowered to 7.3% and 2.1%, respectively.

Key difficulties include modeling complex multi-scale evolution, correcting inter-frame feature misalignment caused by displacement, and efficiently capturing long-range spatiotemporal context without sacrificing spatial fidelity. To address these issues, we present the Multi-scale Feature Communication Rectified Flow (RF) Network (MFC-RFNet), a generative framework that integrates multi-scale communication with guided feature fusion. To enhance multi-scale fusion while retaining fine detail, a Wavelet-Guided Skip Connection (WGSC) preserves high-frequency components, and a Feature Communication Module (FCM) promotes bidirectional cross-scale interaction. To correct inter-frame displacement, a Condition-Guided Spatial Transform Fusion (CGSTF) learns spatial transforms from conditioning echoes to align shallow features. The backbone adopts rectified flow training to learn near-linear probability-flow trajectories, enabling few-step sampling with stable fidelity. Additionally, lightweight Vision-RWKV (RWKV) blocks are placed at the encoder tail, the bottleneck, and the first decoder layer to capture long-range spatiotemporal dependencies at low spatial resolutions with moderate compute.

This paper presents CrackSegFlow, a controllable flow-matching synthesis framework that generates photorealistic crack images conditioned on binary masks while preserving strict mask-image alignment. The generator combines topology-preserving mask injection with boundary-gated modulation to maintain thin-structure continuity and suppress texture-driven false positives. A second class-conditional flow-matching model synthesizes crack masks with explicit control over crack coverage, enabling balanced, topology-diverse paired data without additional manual annotation. We further inject crack masks into crack-free backgrounds to diversify illumination and surface artifacts and reduce false positives caused by shadows, joints, and pavement markings. Experiments on five benchmarks spanning four asphalt datasets and the crack class of a concrete-domain dataset demonstrate consistent improvements under an established hybrid CNN--Transformer segmentation backbone and a fixed training protocol. With real plus synthesized pairs, in-domain performance improves on average by 5.37 mIoU and 5.13 F1, and target-guided cross-domain synthesis yields average gains of 13.12 mIoU and 14.82 F1 using only limited target mask statistics. Compared with diffusion-based semantic synthesis, CrackSegFlow provides substantially faster deterministic sampling and improves fidelity and mask-image alignment for thin-structure crack geometry. Finally, we release CSF-50K, a public dataset of 50,000 paired crack images and pixel-accurate masks for large-scale benchmarking of generalizable crack segmentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A topic of continued interest in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence is whether some neurons behave like grandmother cells, i.e., neurons that are inherently interpretable because they exclusively respond to single concepts. In this work, we propose two information-theoretic measures that quantify the neuronal saliency and selectivity for single concepts. We apply these metrics to the representations of TabPFN, a tabular foundation model, and perform a simple search across neuron-concept pairs to find the most salient and selective pair. Our analysis provides the first evidence that some neurons in such models show moderate, statistically significant saliency and selectivity for high-level concepts.

Existing models can produce high-quality short clips but often fail to preserve entity identity and appearance when scenes change or when entities reappear after long temporal gaps. We present VideoMemory, an entity-centric framework that integrates narrative planning with visual generation through a Dynamic Memory Bank. Given a structured script, a multi-agent system decomposes the narrative into shots, retrieves entity representations from memory, and synthesizes keyframes and videos conditioned on these retrieved states. The Dynamic Memory Bank stores explicit visual and semantic descriptors for characters, props, and backgrounds, and is updated after each shot to reflect story-driven changes while preserving identity. This retrieval-update mechanism enables consistent portrayal of entities across distant shots and supports coherent long-form generation. To evaluate this setting, we construct a 54-case multi-shot consistency benchmark covering character-, prop-, and background-persistent scenarios.

Most existing PINN-based prognostics approaches are deterministic or account only for epistemic uncertainty, limiting their suitability for risk-aware decision-making. This work introduces a heteroscedastic Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network (B-PINN) framework that jointly models epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, yielding full predictive posteriors for spatiotemporal insulation material ageing estimation. The approach integrates Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) with physics-based residual enforcement and prior distributions, enabling probabilistic inference within a physics-informed learning architecture. The framework is evaluated on transformer insulation ageing application, validated with a finite-element thermal model and field measurements from a solar power plant, and benchmarked against deterministic PINNs, dropout-based PINNs (d-PINNs), and alternative B-PINN variants. Results show that the proposed B-PINN provides improved predictive accuracy and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates than competing approaches.

However, applying VLMs to 6-DoF endoscopic camera localization presents several challenges: 1) the lack of large-scale, high-quality, densely annotated, and localization-oriented vision-language datasets in real-world medical settings; 2) limited capability for fine-grained pose regression; and 3) high computational latency when extracting temporal features from past frames. To address these issues, we first construct BREATH dataset, the largest in-vivo endoscopic localization dataset to date, collected in the complex human airway. Building on this dataset, we propose BREATH-VL, a hybrid framework that integrates semantic cues from VLMs with geometric information from vision-based registration methods for accurate 6-DoF pose estimation. Our motivation lies in the complementary strengths of both approaches: VLMs offer generalizable semantic understanding, while registration methods provide precise geometric alignment. To further enhance the VLM's ability to capture temporal context, we introduce a lightweight context-learning mechanism that encodes motion history as linguistic prompts, enabling efficient temporal reasoning without expensive video-level computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the vision-language module delivers robust semantic localization in challenging surgical scenes. Building on this, our BREATH-VL outperforms state-of-the-art vision-only localization methods in both accuracy and generalization, reducing translational error by 25.5% compared with the best-performing baseline, while achieving competitive computational latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, the privacy risks associated with these models remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate information leakage in such models through three types of black-box inference attacks. First, we design a graph reconstruction attack, which can reconstruct graphs structurally similar to those training graphs from the generated graphs. Second, we propose a property inference attack to infer the properties of the training graphs, such as the average graph density and the distribution of densities, from the generated graphs. Third, we develop two membership inference attacks to determine whether a given graph is present in the training set. Extensive experiments on three different types of graph generative diffusion models and six real-world graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks, significantly outperforming the baseline approaches. Finally, we propose two defense mechanisms that mitigate these inference attacks and achieve a better trade-off between defense strength and target model utility than existing methods.

We introduce TreeAdv (Tree-Structured Advantage Redistribution for Group-Based RL), which makes the tree structure of group rollouts explicit for both exploration and advantage assignment. Specifically, TreeAdv builds a group of trees (a forest) based on an entropy-driven sampling method where each tree branches at high-uncertainty decisions while sharing low-uncertainty tokens across rollouts. Then, TreeAdv aggregates token-level advantages for internal tree segments by redistributing the advantages of complete rollouts (all leaf nodes), and TreeAdv can easily apply to group-based objectives such as GRPO or GSPO.

The lack of experimentally resolved protein structures limits the performance of structure-based machine learning models, which generally outperform sequence-based methods. In order to overcome this constraint, we suggest a regression framework based on knowledge distillation that uses protein structural data during training and only needs sequence data during inference. The suggested method uses binding affinity labels and intermediate feature representations to jointly supervise the training of a sequence-based student network under the guidance of a structure-informed teacher network. Leave-One-Complex-Out (LOCO) cross-validation was used to assess the framework on a non-redundant protein--protein binding affinity benchmark dataset. A maximum Pearson correlation coefficient (P_r) of 0.375 and an RMSE of 2.712 kcal/mol were obtained by sequence-only baseline models, whereas a P_r of 0.512 and an RMSE of 2.445 kcal/mol were obtained by structure-based models. With a P_r of 0.481 and an RMSE of 2.488 kcal/mol, the distillation-based student model greatly enhanced sequence-only performance. Improved agreement and decreased bias were further confirmed by thorough error analyses. With the potential to close the performance gap between sequence-based and structure-based models as larger datasets become available, these findings show that knowledge distillation is an efficient method for transferring structural knowledge to sequence-based predictors.

While hyperspectral image offers a powerful alternative by capturing fine-grained spectral signatures, progress in hyperspectral camouflaged object detection (HCOD) has been critically hampered by the absence of a dedicated, large-scale benchmark. To spur innovation, we introduce HyperCOD, the first challenging benchmark for HCOD. Comprising 350 high-resolution hyperspectral images, It features complex real-world scenarios with minimal objects, intricate shapes, severe occlusions, and dynamic lighting to challenge current models. The advent of foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) presents a compelling opportunity. To adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for HCOD, we propose HyperSpectral Camouflage-aware SAM (HSC-SAM). HSC-SAM ingeniously reformulates the hyperspectral image by decoupling it into a spatial map fed to SAM's image encoder and a spectral saliency map that serves as an adaptive prompt. This translation effectively bridges the modality gap. Extensive experiments show that HSC-SAM sets a new state-of-the-art on HyperCOD and generalizes robustly to other public HSI datasets.

Despite its success in simple scenarios, this paradigm still significantly struggles with compositional editing tasks that require precise local control and complex multi-object spatial reasoning. This paradigm is severely limited by 1) the implicit coupling of planning and execution, 2) the lack of object-level control granularity, and 3) the reliance on unstructured, pixel-centric modeling. To address these limitations, we propose I2E, a novel \"Decompose-then-Action\" paradigm that revisits image editing as an actionable interaction process within a structured environment. I2E utilizes a Decomposer to transform unstructured images into discrete, manipulable object layers and then introduces a physics-aware Vision-Language-Action Agent to parse complex instructions into a series of atomic actions via Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Further, we also construct I2E-Bench, a benchmark designed for multi-instance spatial reasoning and high-precision editing. Experimental results on I2E-Bench and multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that I2E significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in handling complex compositional instructions, maintaining physical plausibility, and ensuring multi-turn editing stability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Exploration suffers from low success rates on difficult tasks and high costs of repeated rollouts from scratch. Exploitation suffers from coarse credit assignment and training instability: Trajectory-level rewards penalize valid prefixes for later errors, and failure-dominated groups overwhelm the few positive signals, leaving optimization without constructive direction. To this end, we propose R$^3$L, Reflect-then-Retry Reinforcement Learning with Language-Guided Exploration, Pivotal Credit, and Positive Amplification. To synthesize high-quality trajectories, R$^3$L shifts from stochastic sampling to active synthesis via reflect-then-retry, leveraging language feedback to diagnose errors, transform failed attempts into successful ones, and reduce rollout costs by restarting from identified failure points. With errors diagnosed and localized, Pivotal Credit Assignment updates only the diverging suffix where contrastive signals exist, excluding the shared prefix from gradient update. Since failures dominate on difficult tasks and reflect-then-retry produces off-policy data, risking training instability, Positive Amplification upweights successful trajectories to ensure positive signals guide the optimization process.

However, while these approaches effectively enhance perception abilities, they primarily target holistic content understanding, often lacking explicit supervision for intrinsic temporal coherence and inter-frame correlations. This tendency limits the models' ability to capture intricate dynamics and fine-grained visual causality. To explicitly bridge this gap, we propose a novel post-training objective: Masked Video Prediction (MVP). By requiring the model to reconstruct a masked continuous segment from a set of challenging distractors, MVP forces the model to attend to the sequential logic and temporal context of events. To support scalable training, we introduce a scalable data synthesis pipeline capable of transforming arbitrary video corpora into MVP training samples, and further employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a fine-grained reward function to enhance the model's understanding of video context and temporal properties.

This design implicitly assumes signal homogeneity, a premise misaligned with the heterogeneous nature of outcome-driven learning, where advantage magnitudes and variances fluctuate significantly. Consequently, static constraints fail to fully exploit high-quality signals while insufficiently suppressing noise, often precipitating rapid entropy collapse. To address this, we propose \\textbf{E}lastic \\textbf{T}rust \\textbf{R}egions (\\textbf{ETR}), a dynamic mechanism that aligns optimization constraints with signal quality. ETR constructs a signal-aware landscape through dual-level elasticity: at the micro level, it scales clipping boundaries based on advantage magnitude to accelerate learning from high-confidence paths; at the macro level, it leverages group variance to implicitly allocate larger update budgets to tasks in the optimal learning zone.

We measure their relative performance when used to train an AI object detection model to separate stones and potatoes in a bin picking environment. We demonstrate that using highly representative 3D models acquired by scanning or using image-to-3D approaches can be used to generate synthetic data for training object detection models. Finetuning on a small real dataset can significantly improve the performance of the models and even get similar performance when less representative models are used.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u519c\u4e1a\u56fe\u50cf\u8bc6\u522b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66ff\u4ee3CAD\u6587\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u914d\u5408\u5c11\u91cf\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u519c\u4e1a\u884c\u4e1a\u7f3a\u5c11\u73b0\u6210\u7684CAD\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46AI\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5236\u9020\u9886\u57df\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u9ad8\u53d8\u5f02\u3001\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u519c\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u66ff\u4ee3CAD\u6587\u4ef6\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u626b\u63cf\u83b7\u53d6\u9ad8\u4ee3\u8868\u60273D\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c3D\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u79bb\u77f3\u5934\u548c\u9a6c\u94c3\u85af", "result": "\u9ad8\u4ee3\u8868\u60273D\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u914d\u5408\u5c11\u91cf\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u4f7f\u7528\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e5f\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "\u5728\u519c\u4e1a\u5de5\u4e1a\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u66ff\u4ee3CAD\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c11\u91cf\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd"}}

A common strategy in LLM fine-tuning is curriculum learning, which pre-orders training samples based on metrics like difficulty to improve learning efficiency compared to a random sampling strategy. However, most existing methods for LLM fine-tuning rely on a static curriculum, designed prior to training, which lacks adaptability to the model's evolving needs during fine-tuning. To address this, we propose EDCO, a novel framework based on two key concepts: inference entropy and dynamic curriculum orchestration. Inspired by recent findings that maintaining high answer entropy benefits long-term reasoning gains, EDCO prioritizes samples with high inference entropy in a continuously adapted curriculum. EDCO integrates three core components: an efficient entropy estimator that uses prefix tokens to approximate full-sequence entropy, an entropy-based curriculum generator that selects data points with the highest inference entropy, and an LLM trainer that optimizes the model on the selected curriculum. Comprehensive experiments in communication, medicine and law domains, EDCO outperforms traditional curriculum strategies for fine-tuning Qwen3-4B and Llama3.2-3B models under supervised and reinforcement learning settings. Furthermore, the proposed efficient entropy estimation reduces computational time by 83.5% while maintaining high accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "EDCO\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u7406\u71b5\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7f16\u6392\u6539\u8fdb\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u71b5\u6837\u672c\u4f18\u5148\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u9759\u6001\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u6c42\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEDCO\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u9ad8\u6548\u71b5\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff08\u7528\u524d\u7f00token\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5168\u5e8f\u5217\u71b5\uff09\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u7684\u8bfe\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u5668\uff08\u9009\u62e9\u63a8\u7406\u71b5\u6700\u9ad8\u6837\u672c\uff09\u548cLLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u5668\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u52a8\u6001\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7f16\u6392\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u533b\u5b66\u548c\u6cd5\u5f8b\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cEDCO\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u9ad8\u6548\u71b5\u4f30\u8ba1\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1183.5%\u4e14\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "EDCO\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5148\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u71b5\u6837\u672c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6LLM\u5fae\u8c03\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

We introduce a performance-aware, closed-loop solution in the NNGPT ecosystem of projects that enables LLMs to autonomously engineer optimal transformations by internalizing empirical performance cues. We fine-tune LLMs with Low-Rank Adaptation on a novel repository of more than 6,000 empirically evaluated PyTorch augmentation functions, each annotated solely by downstream model accuracy. Training uses pairwise performance ordering (better-worse transformations), enabling alignment through empirical feedback without reinforcement learning, reward models, or symbolic objectives. This reduces the need for exhaustive search, achieving up to 600x times fewer evaluated candidates than brute-force discovery while maintaining competitive peak accuracy and shifting generation from random synthesis to task-aligned design. Ablation studies show that structured Chain-of-Thought prompting introduces syntactic noise and degrades performance, whereas direct prompting ensures stable optimization in performance-critical code tasks. Qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate that the model internalizes semantic performance cues rather than memorizing syntax.

Yet forecast users often face a difficult trade-off. Many decision-relevant targets are functionals of the atmospheric state variables, such as extrema, accumulations, and threshold exceedances, rather than state variables themselves. As a result, users must estimate these targets via post-processing, which can be suboptimal and can introduce structural bias. The core issue is that decisions depend on distributions over these functionals that the model is not trained to learn directly.\n  In this work, we introduce GEM-2, a probabilistic transformer that jointly learns global atmospheric dynamics alongside a suite of variables that users directly act upon. Using this training recipe, we show that a lightweight (~275M params) and computationally efficient (~20-100x training speedup relative to state-of-the-art) transformer trained on the CRPS objective can directly outperform operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) models and be competitive with ML models that rely on expensive multi-step diffusion processes or require bespoke multi-stage fine-tuning strategies. We further demonstrate state-of-the-art economic value metrics under decision-theoretic evaluation, stable convergence to climatology at S2S and seasonal timescales, and a surprising insensitivity to many commonly assumed architectural and training design choices.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86GEM-2\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u5168\u7403\u5927\u6c14\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u6982\u7387\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b(~275M)\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347(~20-100\u500d\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a0\u901f)\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u503c\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u9762\u4e34\u6838\u5fc3\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u8bb8\u591a\u4e0e\u51b3\u7b56\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u662f\u5927\u6c14\u72b6\u6001\u53d8\u91cf\u7684\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u5982\u6781\u503c\u3001\u7d2f\u79ef\u91cf\u3001\u9608\u503c\u8d85\u8fc7\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u72b6\u6001\u53d8\u91cf\u672c\u8eab\u3002\u7528\u6237\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u5904\u7406\u4f30\u7b97\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u8fd9\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6b21\u4f18\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u672a\u76f4\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd9\u4e9b\u51fd\u6570\u4e0a\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165GEM-2\u6982\u7387\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\u76f4\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60\u5168\u7403\u5927\u6c14\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u3002\u4f7f\u7528CRPS\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316(~275M\u53c2\u6570)\u548c\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387(~20-100\u500d\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a0\u901f)\u3002", "result": "GEM-2\u76f4\u63a5\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e1a\u52a1\u6570\u503c\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u591a\u6b65\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6216\u9700\u8981\u5b9a\u5236\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7ade\u4e89\u3002\u5728\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0b\u53d6\u5f97\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u4ef7\u503c\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5728S2S\u548c\u5b63\u8282\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7a33\u5b9a\u6536\u655b\u5230\u6c14\u5019\u6001\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u8bb8\u591a\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u60ca\u4eba\u7684\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "GEM-2\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u76f4\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60\u51b3\u7b56\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7740\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In our Latent Instance Difficulty (LID) model, each input's target variance is governed by a latent ``precision'' drawn from a heavy-tailed distribution. While generalization loss recovers standard scaling laws, our main contribution connects this to inference. The pass@$k$ failure rate exhibits a power-law decay, $k^{-\u03b2_\\text{eff}}$, but the observed exponent $\u03b2_\\text{eff}$ is training-dependent. It grows with sample size $N$ before saturating at an intrinsic limit $\u03b2$ set by the difficulty distribution's tail. This coupling reveals that learning shrinks the ``hard tail'' of the error distribution: improvements in the model's generalization error steepen the pass@$k$ curve until irreducible target variance dominates. The LID model yields testable, closed-form predictions for this behavior, including a compute-allocation rule that favors training before saturation and inference attempts after. We validate these predictions in simulations and in two real-data proxies: CIFAR-10H (human-label variance) and a maths teacher-student distillation task.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Among these parameters, Gaussian means are particularly difficult to predict, so depth is usually estimated first and then unprojected to obtain the Gaussian sphere centers. Existing methods typically rely solely on a single warp to estimate depth probability, which hinders their ability to fully leverage cross-view geometric cues, resulting in unstable and coarse depth maps. To address this limitation, we propose IDESplat, which iteratively applies warp operations to boost depth probability estimation for accurate Gaussian mean prediction. First, to eliminate the inherent instability of a single warp, we introduce a Depth Probability Boosting Unit (DPBU) that integrates epipolar attention maps produced by cascading warp operations in a multiplicative manner. Next, we construct an iterative depth estimation process by stacking multiple DPBUs, progressively identifying potential depth candidates with high likelihood. As IDESplat iteratively boosts depth probability estimates and updates the depth candidates, the depth map is gradually refined, resulting in accurate Gaussian means. We conduct experiments on RealEstate10K, ACID, and DL3DV. IDESplat achieves outstanding reconstruction quality and state-of-the-art performance with real-time efficiency.

Semantic backdoors are significantly harder to detect than backdoors that are based on trigger patterns due to the lack of such clearly identifiable patterns. We tackle this problem under the assumption that the clean training dataset and the training recipe of the model are both known. These assumptions are motivated by a consumer protection scenario, in which the responsible authority performs mystery shopping to test a machine learning service provider. In this scenario, the authority uses the provider's resources and tools to train a model on a given dataset and tests whether the provider included a backdoor. In our proposed approach, the authority creates a reference model pool by training a small number of clean and poisoned models using trusted infrastructure, and calibrates a model distance threshold to identify clean models. We propose and experimentally analyze a number of approaches to compute model distances and we also test a scenario where the provider performs an adaptive attack to avoid detection. The most reliable method is based on requesting adversarial training from the provider. The model distance is best measured using a set of input samples generated by inverting the models in such a way as to maximize the distance from clean samples. With these settings, our method can often completely separate clean and poisoned models, and it proves to be superior to state-of-the-art backdoor detectors as well.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u68c0\u6d4b\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8bed\u4e49\u540e\u95e8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u4fdd\u62a4\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u7acb\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u6c60\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u8ddd\u79bb\u9608\u503c\u6765\u533a\u5206\u5e72\u51c0\u548c\u4e2d\u6bd2\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u89e6\u53d1\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u68c0\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u8f83\u591a\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u540e\u95e8\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5173\u6ce8\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u8bed\u4e49\u540e\u95e8\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6e05\u6670\u53ef\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u89e6\u53d1\u6a21\u5f0f\u800c\u66f4\u96be\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u88ab\u6076\u610f\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u5047\u5b9a\u5df2\u77e5\u5e72\u51c0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u53ef\u4fe1\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c11\u91cf\u5e72\u51c0\u548c\u4e2d\u6bd2\u6a21\u578b\u5efa\u7acb\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u6c60\uff0c\u6821\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u8ddd\u79bb\u9608\u503c\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u5e72\u51c0\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u6a21\u578b\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u63a8\u8350\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bf7\u6c42\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u8f6c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u6837\u672c\u6765\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4e0e\u5e72\u51c0\u6837\u672c\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u6765\u6d4b\u91cf\u6a21\u578b\u8ddd\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u80fd\u5b8c\u5168\u5206\u79bb\u5e72\u51c0\u548c\u4e2d\u6bd2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u540e\u95e8\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u653b\u51fb\u4ee5\u89c4\u907f\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u4fdd\u62a4\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bed\u4e49\u540e\u95e8\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u8f6c\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8ddd\u79bb\u6d4b\u91cf\u662f\u6700\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u9632\u8303\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6076\u610f\u540e\u95e8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6280\u672f\u624b\u6bb5\u3002"}}

However, screenshots are tokenized into thousands of visual tokens (e.g., about 4700 for 2K resolution), incurring significant computational overhead and diluting attention. In contrast, humans typically focus on regions of interest when interacting with UI. In this work, we pioneer the task of efficient UI grounding. Guided by practical analysis of the task's characteristics and challenges, we propose FocusUI, an efficient UI grounding framework that selects patches most relevant to the instruction while preserving positional continuity for precise grounding. FocusUI addresses two key challenges: (1) Eliminating redundant tokens in visual encoding. We construct patch-level supervision by fusing an instruction-conditioned score with a rule-based UI-graph score that down-weights large homogeneous regions to select distinct and instruction-relevant visual tokens. (2) Preserving positional continuity during visual token selection. We find that general visual token pruning methods suffer from severe accuracy degradation on UI grounding tasks due to broken positional information. We introduce a novel PosPad strategy, which compresses each contiguous sequence of dropped visual tokens into a single special marker placed at the sequence's last index to preserve positional continuity. Comprehensive experiments on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that FocusUI surpasses GUI-specific baselines. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, FocusUI-7B achieves a performance improvement of 3.7% over GUI-Actor-7B.

However, most existing methods struggle to achieve robust performance on real-world domains such as medical imaging, or are inefficient when handling non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) data. To address these limitations, we introduce FALCON, a framework that enhances the effectiveness of OSFL over non-IID image data. The core idea of FALCON is to leverage the feature-aware hierarchical token sequences generation and knowledge distillation into OSFL. First, each client leverages a pretrained visual encoder with hierarchical scale encoding to compress images into hierarchical token sequences, which capture multi-scale semantics. Second, a multi-scale autoregressive transformer generator is used to model the distribution of these token sequences and generate the synthetic sequences. Third, clients upload the synthetic sequences along with the local classifier trained on the real token sequences to the server. Finally, the server incorporates knowledge distillation into global training to reduce reliance on precise distribution modeling. Experiments on medical and natural image datasets validate the effectiveness of FALCON in diverse non-IID scenarios, outperforming the best OSFL baselines by 9.58% in average accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, this language-like formulation overlooks key properties of vision, particularly the hierarchical and residual network designs that have long been essential for convergence and efficiency in visual models. To bring \"vision\" back to vision, we propose the Residual Tokenizer (ResTok), a 1D visual tokenizer that builds hierarchical residuals for both image tokens and latent tokens. The hierarchical representations obtained through progressively merging enable cross-level feature fusion at each layer, substantially enhancing representational capacity. Meanwhile, the semantic residuals between hierarchies prevent information overlap, yielding more concentrated latent distributions that are easier for AR modeling. Cross-level bindings consequently emerge without any explicit constraints. To accelerate the generation process, we further introduce a hierarchical AR generator that substantially reduces sampling steps by predicting an entire level of latent tokens at once rather than generating them strictly token-by-token. Extensive experiments demonstrate that restoring hierarchical residual priors in visual tokenization significantly improves AR image generation, achieving a gFID of 2.34 on ImageNet-256 with only 9 sampling steps.

Despite this, existing human motion synthesis methods fall short: some ignore hand motions entirely, while others generate full-body motions only for narrowly scoped tasks under highly constrained settings. A key obstacle is the lack of large-scale datasets that jointly capture diverse full-body motion with detailed hand articulation. While some datasets capture both, they are limited in scale and diversity. Conversely, large-scale datasets typically focus either on body motion without hands or on hand motions without the body. To overcome this, we curate and unify existing hand motion datasets with large-scale body motion data to generate full-body sequences that capture both hand and body. We then propose the first diffusion-based unconditional full-body motion prior, FUSION, which jointly models body and hand motion. Despite using a pose-based motion representation, FUSION surpasses state-of-the-art skeletal control models on the Keypoint Tracking task in the HumanML3D dataset and achieves superior motion naturalness. Beyond standard benchmarks, we demonstrate that FUSION can go beyond typical uses of motion priors through two applications: (1) generating detailed full-body motion including fingers during interaction given the motion of an object, and (2) generating Self-Interaction motions using an LLM to transform natural language cues into actionable motion constraints. For these applications, we develop an optimization pipeline that refines the latent space of our diffusion model to generate task-specific motions.

PosterVerse replicates professional design through three key stages: (1) blueprint creation using fine-tuned LLMs to extract key design elements from user requirements, (2) graphical background generation via customized diffusion models to create visually appealing imagery, and (3) unified layout-text rendering with an MLLM-powered HTML engine to guarantee high text accuracy and flexible customization.

Memory replay methods are widely used for their practicality and effectiveness, but most rely on fixed, step-based heuristics that often misalign with the model's actual learning progress, since identical training steps can result in varying degrees of parameter change. Motivated by recent findings that LLM forgetting mirrors the Ebbinghaus human forgetting curve, we propose FOREVER (FORgEtting curVe-inspired mEmory Replay), a novel CL framework that aligns replay schedules with a model-centric notion of time. FOREVER defines model time using the magnitude of optimizer updates, allowing forgetting curve-inspired replay intervals to align with the model's internal evolution rather than raw training steps. Building on this approach, FOREVER incorporates a forgetting curve-based replay scheduler to determine when to replay and an intensity-aware regularization mechanism to adaptively control how to replay. Extensive experiments on three CL benchmarks and models ranging from 0.6B to 13B parameters demonstrate that FOREVER consistently mitigates catastrophic forgetting.", "AI": {"tldr": "FOREVER\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u9057\u5fd8\u66f2\u7ebf\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u56de\u653e\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u6570\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9645\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u5ea6\u5e38\u5e38\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u9aa4\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u540c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u9057\u5fd8\u66f2\u7ebf\u7406\u8bba\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u56de\u653e\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u6f14\u5316\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "method": "FOREVER\u6846\u67b6\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u66f4\u65b0\u5e45\u5ea6\u7684'\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u95f4'\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u6f14\u5316\u540c\u6b65\u800c\u975e\u5355\u7eaf\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u6570\u3002\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u90e8\u5206\uff1a1) \u9057\u5fd8\u66f2\u7ebf\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u56de\u653e\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u51b3\u5b9a\u4f55\u65f6\u56de\u653e\uff1b2) \u5f3a\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u673a\u5236\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u5982\u4f55\u56de\u653e\uff1b3) \u6574\u4e2a\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fdb\u5ea6\u4fdd\u6301\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\uff0c\u5bf90.6B\u523013B\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eFOREVER\u80fd\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5730\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "FOREVER\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4f7f\u56de\u653e\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9645\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6297\u9057\u5fd8\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While these models typically assess visual quality, motion quality, and text alignment, they often overlook key structural distortions, such as abnormal object appearances and interactions, which can degrade the overall quality of the generative video. To address this gap, we introduce REACT, a frame-level reward model designed specifically for structural distortions evaluation in generative videos. REACT assigns point-wise scores and attribution labels by reasoning over video frames, focusing on recognizing distortions. To support this, we construct a large-scale human preference dataset, annotated based on our proposed taxonomy of structural distortions, and generate additional data using a efficient Chain-of-Thought (CoT) synthesis pipeline. REACT is trained with a two-stage framework: ((1) supervised fine-tuning with masked loss for domain knowledge injection, followed by (2) reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and pairwise rewards to enhance reasoning capability and align output scores with human preferences. During inference, a dynamic sampling mechanism is introduced to focus on frames most likely to exhibit distortion. We also present REACT-Bench, a benchmark for generative video distortion evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that REACT complements existing reward models in assessing structutal distortion, achieving both accurate quantitative evaluations and interpretable attribution analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "REACT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7ed3\u6784\u5931\u771f\u7684\u5e27\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u70b9\u7ea7\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u5f52\u56e0\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u9ad8\u8bc4\u4f30\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u5173\u6ce8\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5931\u771f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u8d28\u91cf\u3002REACT\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "1. \u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5931\u771f\u5206\u7c7b\u8fdb\u884c\u6807\u6ce8\uff1b2. \u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u5408\u6210\u6d41\u7a0b\u751f\u6210\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\uff1b3. \u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u6ce8\u5165\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6210\u5bf9\u5956\u52b1\u589e\u5f3a\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff1b4. \u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u673a\u5236\u805a\u7126\u6f5c\u5728\u5931\u771f\u5e27\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eREACT\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8865\u5145\u73b0\u6709\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u6784\u5931\u771f\u65b9\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "REACT\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7ed3\u6784\u5931\u771f\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u7528\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u914d\u5957\u57fa\u51c6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

ML-based cancer survival analysis has been a long-standing topic in the literature; however, studies involving the explainability and transparency of ML survivability models are limited. Our use of explainability techniques, including SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), enabled us to illustrate significant feature-cancer stage interactions that would have remained hidden in traditional black-box models. We identified how certain demographic and clinical variables influenced survival differently across cancer stages and types.

Central to automating these inspections is the accurate segmentation of turbine blades from visual data. This task is traditionally addressed through dense, pixel-wise deep learning models. However, such methods demand extensive annotated datasets, posing scalability challenges. In this work, we introduce an annotation-efficient segmentation approach that reframes the pixel-level task into a binary region classification problem. Image regions are generated using a fully unsupervised, interpretable Modular Adaptive Region Growing technique, guided by image-specific Adaptive Thresholding and enhanced by a Region Merging process that consolidates fragmented areas into coherent segments. To improve generalization and classification robustness, we introduce RegionMix, an augmentation strategy that synthesizes new training samples by combining distinct regions. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy and strong cross-site generalization by consistently segmenting turbine blades across distinct windfarms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing Direct Preference Otimization (DPO) methods rely on multi-sample ranking and task-specific critic models, which is inefficient and often yields ambiguous global supervision. To address these limitations, we propose LocalDPO, a novel post-training framework that constructs localized preference pairs from real videos and optimizes alignment at the spatio-temporal region level. We design an automated pipeline to efficiently collect preference pair data that generates preference pairs with a single inference per prompt, eliminating the need for external critic models or manual annotation. Specifically, we treat high-quality real videos as positive samples and generate corresponding negatives by locally corrupting them with random spatio-temporal masks and restoring only the masked regions using the frozen base model. During training, we introduce a region-aware DPO loss that restricts preference learning to corrupted areas for rapid convergence.

Due to better interpretability, it is a machine learning paradigm particularly powerful for scientific discovery. In recent years, several works have expanded the concept to allow the description of similar phenomena using a single expression with varying sets of parameters, thereby introducing categorical variables. Some previous works allow only \"non-shared\" (category-value-specific) parameters, and others also incorporate \"shared\" (category-value-agnostic) parameters. We expand upon those efforts by considering multiple categorical variables, and introducing intermediate levels of parameter sharing. With two categorical variables, an intermediate level of parameter sharing emerges, i.e., parameters which are shared across either category but change across the other. The new approach potentially decreases the number of parameters, while revealing additional information about the problem. Using a synthetic, fitting-only example, we test the limits of this setup in terms of data requirement reduction and transfer learning. As a real-world symbolic regression example, we demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach on an astrophysics dataset used in a previous study, which considered only one categorical variable.

In this paper, we identify a critical failure mode termed textual inertia, where once a textual hallucination occurs in the thinking process, models tend to blindly adhere to the erroneous text while neglecting conflicting visual evidence. To systematically investigate this, we propose the LogicGraph Perturbation Protocol that structurally injects perturbations into the reasoning chains of diverse LMMs spanning both native reasoning architectures and prompt-driven paradigms to evaluate their self-reflection capabilities. The results reveal that models successfully self-correct in less than 10% of cases and predominantly succumb to blind textual error propagation. To mitigate this, we introduce Active Visual-Context Refinement, a training-free inference paradigm which orchestrates an active visual re-grounding mechanism to enforce fine-grained verification coupled with an adaptive context refinement strategy to summarize and denoise the reasoning history.

This decoupling undermines reliability in strategic spatial decision-making. To address this, we present GeoReason, a framework designed to synchronize internal thinking with final decisions. We first construct GeoReason-Bench, a logic-driven dataset containing 4,000 reasoning trajectories synthesized from geometric primitives and expert knowledge. We then formulate a two-stage training strategy: (1) Supervised Knowledge Initialization to equip the model with reasoning syntax and domain expertise, and (2) Consistency-Aware Reinforcement Learning to refine deductive reliability. This second stage integrates a novel Logical Consistency Reward, which penalizes logical drift via an option permutation strategy to anchor decisions in verifiable reasoning traces.

We propose Dynafit, a kernel-based method for learning a distance metric between training trajectories and the underlying dynamics.

The learning algorithm approximates the Koopman operator which globally linearizes the dynamics in a (potentially infinite) feature space associated with a kernel function. The distance metric is computed in feature space independently of its dimensionality by using the kernel trick common in machine learning.

However, most deep learning models are designed to process either entire images or complete time series sequences to extract meaningful features for downstream tasks. In this study, we propose a novel multimodal approach that leverages pixel-wise two-dimensional (2D) representations to encode visual property variations from SITS more effectively. Specifically, we generate recurrence plots from pixel-based vegetation index time series (NDVI, EVI, and SAVI) as an alternative to using raw pixel values, creating more informative representations. Additionally, we introduce PIxel-wise Multimodal Contrastive (PIMC), a new multimodal self-supervision approach that produces effective encoders based on two-dimensional pixel time series representations and remote sensing imagery (RSI). To validate our approach, we assess its performance on three downstream tasks: pixel-level forecasting and classification using the PASTIS dataset, and land cover classification on the EuroSAT dataset. Moreover, we compare our results to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on all downstream tasks. Our experimental results show that the use of 2D representations significantly enhances feature extraction from SITS, while contrastive learning improves the quality of representations for both pixel time series and RSI. These findings suggest that our multimodal method outperforms existing models in various Earth observation tasks, establishing it as a robust self-supervision framework for processing both SITS and RSI.

To address these issues, we introduce Klear and delve into three axes--model architecture, training strategy, and data curation. Architecturally, we adopt a single-tower design with unified DiT blocks and an Omni-Full Attention mechanism, achieving tight audio-visual alignment and strong scalability. Training-wise, we adopt a progressive multitask regime--random modality masking to joint optimization across tasks, and a multistage curriculum, yielding robust representations, strengthening A-V aligned world knowledge, and preventing unimodal collapse. For datasets, we present the first large-scale audio-video dataset with dense captions, and introduce a novel automated data-construction pipeline which annotates and filters millions of diverse, high-quality, strictly aligned audio-video-caption triplets. Building on this, Klear scales to large datasets, delivering high-fidelity, semantically and temporally aligned, instruction-following generation in both joint and unimodal settings while generalizing robustly to out-of-distribution scenarios. Across tasks, it substantially outperforms prior methods by a large margin and achieves performance comparable to Veo 3, offering a unified, scalable path toward next-generation audio-video synthesis.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although recent deep models improve robustness compared to classical signal-processing approaches, many methods increase computational cost and parameter count, and attention-based temporal modeling introduces quadratic scaling with respect to the temporal length. This paper proposes ToTMNet, a lightweight rPPG architecture that replaces temporal attention with an FFT-accelerated Toeplitz temporal mixing layer. The Toeplitz operator provides full-sequence temporal receptive field using a linear number of parameters in the clip length and can be applied in near-linear time using circulant embedding and FFT-based convolution. ToTMNet integrates the global Toeplitz temporal operator into a compact gated temporal mixer that combines a local depthwise temporal convolution branch with gated global Toeplitz mixing, enabling efficient long-range temporal filtering while only having 63k parameters. Experiments on two datasets, UBFC-rPPG (real videos) and SCAMPS (synthetic videos), show that ToTMNet achieves strong heart-rate estimation accuracy with a compact design. On UBFC-rPPG intra-dataset evaluation, ToTMNet reaches 1.055 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.996. In a synthetic-to-real setting (SCAMPS to UBFC-rPPG), ToTMNet reaches 1.582 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.994. Ablation results confirm that the gating mechanism is important for effectively using global Toeplitz mixing, especially under domain shift.

In this work, we revisit visual localization with a 2D image-based representation and propose to augment each image with estimated depth maps to capture the geometric structure. Supported by the effective use of dense matchers, this representation is not only easy to build and maintain, but achieves highest accuracy in challenging conditions. With compact compression and a GPU-accelerated LO-RANSAC implementation, the whole pipeline is efficient in both storage and computation and allows for a flexible trade-off between accuracy and highest memory efficiency. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy on various standard benchmarks and outperforms existing memory-efficient methods at comparable map sizes.

In this paper, we present a universal generative pipeline, CHORD, for CHOReographing Dynamic objects and scenes and synthesizing this type of phenomena. Traditional rule-based graphics pipelines to create these dynamics are based on category-specific heuristics, yet are labor-intensive and not scalable. Recent learning-based methods typically demand large-scale datasets, which may not cover all object categories in interest. Our approach instead inherits the universality from the video generative models by proposing a distillation-based pipeline to extract the rich Lagrangian motion information hidden in the Eulerian representations of 2D videos. Our method is universal, versatile, and category-agnostic. We demonstrate its effectiveness by conducting experiments to generate a diverse range of multi-body 4D dynamics, show its advantage compared to existing methods, and demonstrate its applicability in generating robotics manipulation policies.

While state-of-the-art models achieve high intra-session accuracy, their performance often degrades sharply. Existing solutions typically demand large datasets or high-compute pipelines that are impractical for energy-efficient wearables. We propose a lightweight framework for Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) backbone. We introduce three deployment-ready strategies: (i) causal adaptive batch normalization for real-time statistical alignment; (ii) a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) alignment with experience replay to prevent forgetting; and (iii) meta-learning for rapid, few-shot calibration. Evaluated on the NinaPro DB6 multi-session dataset, our framework significantly bridges the inter-session accuracy gap with minimal overhead. Our results show that experience-replay updates yield superior stability under limited data, while meta-learning achieves competitive performance in one- and two-shot regimes using only a fraction of the data required by current benchmarks. This work establishes a path toward robust, \"plug-and-play\" myoelectric control for long-term prosthetic use.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
