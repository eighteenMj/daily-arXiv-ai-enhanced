Abstract: Accurate Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is critical for robotic surgery but remains fragile in specular, fluid-filled endoscopic environments. Existing self-supervised methods, typically relying on foundation models trained with noisy real-world pseudo-labels, often suffer from boundary collapse on thin surgical tools and transparent surfaces. In this work, we address this by leveraging the high-fidelity synthetic priors of the Depth Anything V2 architecture, which inherently captures precise geometric details of thin structures. We efficiently adapt these priors to the medical domain using Dynamic Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (DV-LORA), minimizing the parameter budget while bridging the synthetic-to-real gap. Additionally, we introduce a physically-stratified evaluation protocol on the SCARED dataset to rigorously quantify performance in high-specularity regimes often masked by aggregate metrics. Our approach establishes a new state-of-the-art, achieving an accuracy (< 1.25) of 98.1% and reducing Squared Relative Error by over 17% compared to established baselines, demonstrating superior robustness in adverse surgical lighting.

Abstract: Effective urban warfare training requires situational awareness and muscle memory, developed through repeated practice in realistic yet controlled environments. A key drill, Enter and Clear the Room (ECR), demands threat assessment, coordination, and securing confined spaces. The military uses Synthetic Training Environments that offer scalable, controlled settings for repeated exercises. However, automatic performance assessment remains challenging, particularly when aiming for objective evaluation of cognitive, psychomotor, and teamwork skills. Traditional methods often rely on costly, intrusive sensors or subjective human observation, limiting scalability and accuracy. This paper introduces a video-based assessment pipeline that derives performance analytics from training videos without requiring additional hardware. By utilizing computer vision models, the system extracts 2D skeletons, gaze vectors, and movement trajectories. From these data, we develop task-specific metrics that measure psychomotor fluency, situational awareness, and team coordination. These metrics feed into an extended Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) hierarchy, which employs a weighted combination to generate overall performance scores for teamwork and cognition. We demonstrate the approach with a case study of real-world ECR drills, providing actionable, domain specific metrics that capture individual and team performance. We also discuss how these insights can support After Action Reviews with interactive dashboards within Gamemaster and the Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT), providing intuitive and understandable feedback. We conclude by addressing limitations, including tracking difficulties, ground-truth validation, and the broader applicability of our approach. Future work includes expanding analysis to 3D video data and leveraging video analysis to enable scalable evaluation within STEs.

Abstract: Quantifying normative pediatric cranial development and suture ossification is crucial for diagnosing and treating growth-related cephalic disorders. Computed tomography (CT) is widely used to evaluate cranial and sutural deformities; however, its ionizing radiation is contraindicated in children without significant abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers radiation free scans with superior soft tissue contrast, but unlike CT, MRI cannot elucidate cranial sutures, estimate skull bone density, or assess cranial vault growth. This study proposes a deep learning driven pipeline for transforming T1 weighted MRIs of children aged 0.2 to 2 years into synthetic CTs (sCTs), predicting detailed cranial bone segmentation, generating suture probability heatmaps, and deriving direct suture segmentation from the heatmaps. With our in-house pediatric data, sCTs achieved 99% structural similarity and a Frechet inception distance of 1.01 relative to real CTs. Skull segmentation attained an average Dice coefficient of 85% across seven cranial bones, and sutures achieved 80% Dice. Equivalence of skull and suture segmentation between sCTs and real CTs was confirmed using two one sided tests (TOST p < 0.05). To our knowledge, this is the first pediatric cranial CT synthesis framework to enable suture segmentation on sCTs derived from MRI, despite MRI's limited depiction of bone and sutures. By combining robust, domain specific variational autoencoders, our method generates perceptually indistinguishable cranial sCTs from routine pediatric MRIs, bridging critical gaps in non invasive cranial evaluation.

Abstract: Traditionally, ultrasound skill assessment has relied on expert supervision and feedback, a process known for its subjectivity and time-intensive nature. Previous works on quantitative and automated skill assessment have predominantly employed supervised learning methods, often limiting the analysis to predetermined or assumed factors considered influential in determining skill levels. In this work, we propose a novel bi-level optimisation framework that assesses fetal ultrasound skills by how well a task is performed on the acquired fetal ultrasound images, without using manually predefined skill ratings. The framework consists of a clinical task predictor and a skill predictor, which are optimised jointly by refining the two networks simultaneously. We validate the proposed method on real-world clinical ultrasound videos of scanning the fetal head. The results demonstrate the feasibility of predicting ultrasound skills by the proposed framework, which quantifies optimised task performance as a skill indicator.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个新颖的元引导多模态学习（MGML）框架，用于处理脑肿瘤分割任务中常见的多模态MRI数据缺失问题，包括元参数化自适应模态融合和一致性正则化两个模块，在不改变原模型架构的情况下提升分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在临床实践中，多模态MRI数据常常不完整，难以充分利用可用信息。最大化利用不完整多模态信息成为一个关键的研究挑战。

Abstract: Leveraging multimodal information from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a vital role in lesion segmentation, especially for brain tumors. However, in clinical practice, multimodal MRI data are often incomplete, making it challenging to fully utilize the available information. Therefore, maximizing the utilization of this incomplete multimodal information presents a crucial research challenge. We present a novel meta-guided multi-modal learning (MGML) framework that comprises two components: meta-parameterized adaptive modality fusion and consistency regularization module. The meta-parameterized adaptive modality fusion (Meta-AMF) enables the model to effectively integrate information from multiple modalities under varying input conditions. By generating adaptive soft-label supervision signals based on the available modalities, Meta-AMF explicitly promotes more coherent multimodal fusion. In addition, the consistency regularization module enhances segmentation performance and implicitly reinforces the robustness and generalization of the overall framework. Notably, our approach does not alter the original model architecture and can be conveniently integrated into the training pipeline for end-to-end model optimization. We conducted extensive experiments on the public BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets. Compared to multiple state-of-the-art methods from previous years, our method achieved superior performance. On BraTS2020, for the average Dice scores across fifteen missing modality combinations, building upon the baseline, our method obtained scores of 87.55, 79.36, and 62.67 for the whole tumor (WT), the tumor core (TC), and the enhancing tumor (ET), respectively. We have made our source code publicly available at https://github.com/worldlikerr/MGML.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localisation (CVGL) aims to estimate the geographic location of a query image by matching it with images from a large-scale database. However, the significant view-point discrepancies present considerable challenges for effective feature aggregation and alignment. To address these challenges, we propose a novel CVGL system that incorporates three key improvements. Firstly, we leverage the DINOv2 backbone with a convolution adapter fine-tuning to enhance model adaptability to cross-view variations. Secondly, we propose a multi-scale channel reallocation module to strengthen the diversity and stability of spatial representations. Finally, we propose an improved aggregation module that integrates a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) routing into the feature aggregation process. Specifically, the module dynamically selects expert subspaces for the keys and values in a cross-attention framework, enabling adaptive processing of heterogeneous input domains. Extensive experiments on the University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance with fewer trained parameters.

Abstract: Proficiency in microanastomosis is a critical surgical skill in neurosurgery, where the ability to precisely manipulate fine instruments is crucial to successful outcomes. These procedures require sustained attention, coordinated hand movements, and highly refined motor skills, underscoring the need for objective and systematic methods to evaluate and enhance microsurgical training. Conventional assessment approaches typically rely on expert raters supervising the procedures or reviewing surgical videos, which is an inherently subjective process prone to inter-rater variability, inconsistency, and significant time investment. These limitations highlight the necessity for automated and scalable solutions. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel AI-driven framework for automated action segmentation and performance assessment in microanastomosis procedures, designed to operate efficiently on edge computing platforms. The proposed system comprises three main components: (1) an object tip tracking and localization module based on YOLO and DeepSORT; (2) an action segmentation module leveraging self-similarity matrix for action boundary detection and unsupervised clustering; and (3) a supervised classification module designed to evaluate surgical gesture proficiency. Experimental validation on a dataset of 58 expert-rated microanastomosis videos demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach, achieving a frame-level action segmentation accuracy of 92.4% and an overall skill classification accuracy of 85.5% in replicating expert evaluations. These findings demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to provide objective, real-time feedback in microsurgical education, thereby enabling more standardized, data-driven training protocols and advancing competency assessment in high-stakes surgical environments.

Abstract: Image dehazing is a critical challenge in computer vision, essential for enhancing image clarity in hazy conditions. Traditional methods often rely on atmospheric scattering models, while recent deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers, have improved performance by effectively analyzing image features. However, CNNs struggle with long-range dependencies, and Transformers demand significant computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose DehazeSNN, an innovative architecture that integrates a U-Net-like design with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). DehazeSNN captures multi-scale image features while efficiently managing local and long-range dependencies. The introduction of the Orthogonal Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire Block (OLIFBlock) enhances cross-channel communication, resulting in superior dehazing performance with reduced computational burden. Our extensive experiments show that DehazeSNN is highly competitive to state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets, delivering high-quality haze-free images with a smaller model size and less multiply-accumulate operations. The proposed dehazing method is publicly available at https://github.com/HaoranLiu507/DehazeSNN.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion models has driven remarkable advancements in generating high-quality, temporally coherent videos from natural language descriptions. Despite these achievements, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce T2VAttack, a comprehensive study of adversarial attacks on T2V diffusion models from both semantic and temporal perspectives. Considering the inherently dynamic nature of video data, we propose two distinct attack objectives: a semantic objective to evaluate video-text alignment and a temporal objective to assess the temporal dynamics. To achieve an effective and efficient attack process, we propose two adversarial attack methods: (i) T2VAttack-S, which identifies semantically or temporally critical words in prompts and replaces them with synonyms via greedy search, and (ii) T2VAttack-I, which iteratively inserts optimized words with minimal perturbation to the prompt. By combining these objectives and strategies, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the adversarial robustness of several state-of-the-art T2V models, including ModelScope, CogVideoX, Open-Sora, and HunyuanVideo. Our experiments reveal that even minor prompt modifications, such as the substitution or insertion of a single word, can cause substantial degradation in semantic fidelity and temporal dynamics, highlighting critical vulnerabilities in current T2V diffusion models.

Abstract: This paper presents an effective solution for view extrapolation in autonomous driving scenarios. Recent approaches focus on generating shifted novel view images from given viewpoints using diffusion models. However, these methods heavily rely on priors such as LiDAR point clouds, 3D bounding boxes, and lane annotations, which demand expensive sensors or labor-intensive labeling, limiting applicability in real-world deployment. In this work, with only images and optional camera poses, we first estimate a global static point cloud and per-frame dynamic point clouds, fusing them into a unified representation. We then employ a deformable 4D Gaussian framework to reconstruct the scene. The initially trained 4D Gaussian model renders degraded and pseudo-images to train a video diffusion model. Subsequently, progressively shifted Gaussian renderings are iteratively refined by the diffusion model,and the enhanced results are incorporated back as training data for 4DGS. This process continues until extrapolation reaches the target viewpoints. Compared with baselines, our method produces higher-quality images at novel extrapolated viewpoints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于深度学习的时间序列异常检测方法，利用卫星影像的时间冗余性，通过预测无变化状态下的地表样貌来检测地表变化，相比传统方法具有更高的敏感性和特异性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的卫星影像地表变化检测方法受大气噪声、季节变化和传感器伪影的复杂影响，难以实现高精度监测。需要一种能有效利用时间序列冗余性、对突发地表变化更敏感的新方法。

Method: 基于SATLAS基础模型构建修复模型，利用全球分布的Sentinel-2时序数据训练，从前期影像重建最新帧。当应用于突发地表变化区域时，预测与观测的差异揭示了传统方法遗漏的异常。

Result: 在2023年土叙地震序列的地表破裂检测中，该方法在Tepehan地区检测到裂谷特征，敏感性和特异性均优于时间中值法和Reed-Xiaoli异常检测器，检测阈值比基线方法低约3倍。

Conclusion: 该方法为实现基于免费多光谱卫星数据的自动化全球地表变化监测提供了可行路径，在灾害响应和环境监测方面具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Detecting surface changes from satellite imagery is critical for rapid disaster response and environmental monitoring, yet remains challenging due to the complex interplay between atmospheric noise, seasonal variations, and sensor artifacts. Here we show that deep learning can leverage the temporal redundancy of satellite time series to detect anomalies at unprecedented sensitivity, by learning to predict what the surface should look like in the absence of change. We train an inpainting model built upon the SATLAS foundation model to reconstruct the last frame of a Sentinel-2 time series from preceding acquisitions, using globally distributed training data spanning diverse climate zones and land cover types. When applied to regions affected by sudden surface changes, the discrepancy between prediction and observation reveals anomalies that traditional change detection methods miss. We validate our approach on earthquake-triggered surface ruptures from the 2023 Turkey-Syria earthquake sequence, demonstrating detection of a rift feature in Tepehan with higher sensitivity and specificity than temporal median or Reed-Xiaoli anomaly detectors. Our method reaches detection thresholds approximately three times lower than baseline approaches, providing a path towards automated, global-scale monitoring of surface changes from freely available multi-spectral satellite data.

Result: 在Synapse和ACDC数据集上分别达到86.11%和92.64%的Dice分数，优于Swin-UNet和TransUNet等基线方法，特别是在复杂边界的小解剖结构分割上表现突出。

Conclusion: GCA-ResUNet在分割精度和计算效率之间提供了良好平衡，为临床部署提供了实用、可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of heterogeneous anatomical structures is pivotal for computer-aided diagnosis and subsequent clinical decision-making. Although U-Net based convolutional neural networks have achieved remarkable progress, their intrinsic locality and largely homogeneous attention formulations often limit the modeling of long-range contextual dependencies, especially in multi-organ scenarios and low-contrast regions. Transformer-based architectures mitigate this issue by leveraging global self-attention, but they usually require higher computational resources and larger training data, which may impede deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments.In this paper, we propose GCA-ResUNet, an efficient medical image segmentation framework equipped with a lightweight and plug-and-play Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) module. The proposed GCA decouples channel-wise context modeling into multiple groups to explicitly account for semantic heterogeneity across channels, and integrates direction-aware coordinate encoding to capture structured spatial dependencies along horizontal and vertical axes. This design enhances global representation capability while preserving the efficiency advantages of CNN backbones. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks, Synapse and ACDC, demonstrate that GCA-ResUNet achieves Dice scores of 86.11% and 92.64%, respectively, outperforming a range of representative CNN and Transformer-based methods, including Swin-UNet and TransUNet. In particular, GCA-ResUNet yields consistent improvements in delineating small anatomical structures with complex boundaries. These results indicate that the proposed approach provides a favorable trade-off between segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency, offering a practical and scalable solution for clinical deployment.

Conclusion: 通过引入稳定的拓扑信息来桥接几何与外观特征，能够显著提升自监督语义分割模型对外观歧义的鲁棒性，为解决过度依赖外观特征的问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Self-supervised semantic segmentation methods often fail when faced with appearance ambiguities. We argue that this is due to an over-reliance on unstable, appearance-based features such as shadows, glare, and local textures. We propose \textbf{GASeg}, a novel framework that bridges appearance and geometry by leveraging stable topological information. The core of our method is Differentiable Box-Counting (\textbf{DBC}) module, which quantifies multi-scale topological statistics from two parallel streams: geometric-based features and appearance-based features. To force the model to learn these stable structural representations, we introduce Topological Augmentation (\textbf{TopoAug}), an adversarial strategy that simulates real-world ambiguities by applying morphological operators to the input images. A multi-objective loss, \textbf{GALoss}, then explicitly enforces cross-modal alignment between geometric-based and appearance-based features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GASeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks, including COCO-Stuff, Cityscapes, and PASCAL, validating our approach of bridging geometry and appearance via topological information.

Abstract: This work presents a novel pipeline to recover the 3D structure of an unknown target spacecraft from a sequence of images captured during Rendezvous and Proximity Operations (RPO) in space. The target's geometry and appearance are represented as a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model. However, learning 3DGS requires static scenes, an assumption in contrast to dynamic lighting conditions encountered in spaceborne imagery. The trained 3DGS model can also be used for camera pose estimation through photometric optimization. Therefore, in addition to recovering a geometrically accurate 3DGS model, the photometric accuracy of the rendered images is imperative to downstream pose estimation tasks during the RPO process. This work proposes to incorporate the prior knowledge of the Sun's position, estimated and maintained by the servicer spacecraft, into the training pipeline for improved photometric quality of 3DGS rasterization. Experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution, as 3DGS models trained on a sequence of images learn to adapt to rapidly changing illumination conditions in space and reflect global shadowing and self-occlusion.

Conclusion: CVC通过数学基础的误差校正机制，解决了流基扩散编辑中的轨迹漂移问题，为图像分布变换提供了更可靠和稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent methods in flow-based diffusion editing have enabled direct transformations between source and target image distribution without explicit inversion. However, the latent trajectories in these methods often exhibit accumulated velocity errors, leading to semantic inconsistency and loss of structural fidelity. We propose Conditioned Velocity Correction (CVC), a principled framework that reformulates flow-based editing as a distribution transformation problem driven by a known source prior. CVC rethinks the role of velocity in inter-distribution transformation by introducing a dual-perspective velocity conversion mechanism. This mechanism explicitly decomposes the latent evolution into two components: a structure-preserving branch that remains consistent with the source trajectory, and a semantically-guided branch that drives a controlled deviation toward the target distribution. The conditional velocity field exhibits an absolute velocity error relative to the true underlying distribution trajectory, which inherently introduces potential instability and trajectory drift in the latent space. To address this quantifiable deviation and maintain fidelity to the true flow, we apply a posterior-consistent update to the resulting conditional velocity field. This update is derived from Empirical Bayes Inference and Tweedie correction, which ensures a mathematically grounded error compensation over time. Our method yields stable and interpretable latent dynamics, achieving faithful reconstruction alongside smooth local semantic conversion. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CVC consistently achieves superior fidelity, better semantic alignment, and more reliable editing behavior across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Realistic virtual try-on (VTON) concerns not only faithful rendering of garment details but also coordination of the style. Prior art typically pursues the former, but neglects a key factor that shapes the holistic style -- garment fit. Garment fit delineates how a garment aligns with the body of a wearer and is a fundamental element in fashion design. In this work, we introduce fit-aware VTON and present FitControler, a learnable plug-in that can seamlessly integrate into modern VTON models to enable customized fit control. To achieve this, we highlight two challenges: i) how to delineate layouts of different fits and ii) how to render the garment that matches the layout. FitControler first features a fit-aware layout generator to redraw the body-garment layout conditioned on a set of delicately processed garment-agnostic representations, and a multi-scale fit injector is then used to deliver layout cues to enable layout-driven VTON. In particular, we build a fit-aware VTON dataset termed Fit4Men, including 13,000 body-garment pairs of different fits, covering both tops and bottoms, and featuring varying camera distances and body poses. Two fit consistency metrics are also introduced to assess the fitness of generations. Extensive experiments show that FitControler can work with various VTON models and achieve accurate fit control. Code and data will be released.

Abstract: Recent advances in 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) have demonstrated its potential as a compact image representation with millisecond-level decoding. However, existing 2DGS-based pipelines allocate representation capacity and parameter precision largely oblivious to image structure, limiting their rate-distortion (RD) efficiency at low bitrates. To address this, we propose a structure-guided allocation principle for 2DGS, which explicitly couples image structure with both representation capacity and quantization precision, while preserving native decoding speed. First, we introduce a structure-guided initialization that assigns 2D Gaussians according to spatial structural priors inherent in natural images, yielding a localized and semantically meaningful distribution. Second, during quantization-aware fine-tuning, we propose adaptive bitwidth quantization of covariance parameters, which grants higher precision to small-scale Gaussians in complex regions and lower precision elsewhere, enabling RD-aware optimization, thereby reducing redundancy without degrading edge quality. Third, we impose a geometry-consistent regularization that aligns Gaussian orientations with local gradient directions to better preserve structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach substantially improves both the representational power and the RD performance of 2DGS while maintaining over 1000 FPS decoding. Compared with the baseline GSImage, we reduce BD-rate by 43.44% on Kodak and 29.91% on DIV2K.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) exhibit strong performance across various tasks. However, these VLMs encounter significant challenges when applied to the remote sensing domain due to the inherent differences between remote sensing images and natural images. Existing remote sensing VLMs often fail to extract fine-grained visual features and suffer from visual forgetting during deep language processing. To address this, we introduce MF-RSVLM, a Multi-Feature Fusion Remote Sensing Vision--Language Model that effectively extracts and fuses visual features for RS understanding. MF-RSVLM learns multi-scale visual representations and combines global context with local details, improving the capture of small and complex structures in RS scenes. A recurrent visual feature injection scheme ensures the language model remains grounded in visual evidence and reduces visual forgetting during generation. Extensive experiments on diverse RS benchmarks show that MF-RSVLM achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across remote sensing classification, image captioning, and VQA tasks.

Conclusion: 智能体多MLLM框架通过多轮推理与工具调用，在文本引导物体分割任务中实现了迭代式改进，显著提升了分割准确性，展示了智能体方法在视觉定位任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Text-guided object segmentation requires both cross-modal reasoning and pixel grounding abilities. Most recent methods treat text-guided segmentation as one-shot grounding, where the model predicts pixel prompts in a single forward pass to drive an external segmentor, which limits verification, refocusing and refinement when initial localization is wrong. To address this limitation, we propose RSAgent, an agentic Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) which interleaves reasoning and action for segmentation via multi-turn tool invocations. RSAgent queries a segmentation toolbox, observes visual feedback, and revises its spatial hypothesis using historical observations to re-localize targets and iteratively refine masks. We further build a data pipeline to synthesize multi-turn reasoning segmentation trajectories, and train RSAgent with a two-stage framework: cold-start supervised fine-tuning followed by agentic reinforcement learning with fine-grained, task-specific rewards. Extensive experiments show that RSAgent achieves a zero-shot performance of 66.5% gIoU on ReasonSeg test, improving over Seg-Zero-7B by 9%, and reaches 81.5% cIoU on RefCOCOg, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.

Abstract: Long-form video editing poses unique challenges due to the exponential increase in the computational cost from joint editing and Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) inversion across extended sequences. To address these limitations, we propose PipeFlow, a scalable, pipelined video editing method that introduces three key innovations: First, based on a motion analysis using Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Optical Flow, we identify and propose to skip editing of frames with low motion. Second, we propose a pipelined task scheduling algorithm that splits a video into multiple segments and performs DDIM inversion and joint editing in parallel based on available GPU memory. Lastly, we leverage a neural network-based interpolation technique to smooth out the border frames between segments and interpolate the previously skipped frames. Our method uniquely scales to longer videos by dividing them into smaller segments, allowing PipeFlow's editing time to increase linearly with video length. In principle, this enables editing of infinitely long videos without the growing per-frame computational overhead encountered by other methods. PipeFlow achieves up to a 9.6X speedup compared to TokenFlow and a 31.7X speedup over Diffusion Motion Transfer (DMT).

Abstract: Image denoising is an important problem in low-level vision and serves as a critical module for many image recovery tasks. Anisotropic diffusion is a wide family of image denoising approaches with promising performance. However, traditional anisotropic diffusion approaches use explicit diffusion operators which are not well adapted to complex image structures. As a result, their performance is limited compared to recent learning-based approaches. In this work, we describe a trainable anisotropic diffusion framework based on reinforcement learning. By modeling the denoising process as a series of naive diffusion actions with order learned by deep Q-learning, we propose an effective diffusion-based image denoiser. The diffusion actions selected by deep Q-learning at different iterations indeed composite a stochastic anisotropic diffusion process with strong adaptivity to different image structures, which enjoys improvement over the traditional ones. The proposed denoiser is applied to removing three types of often-seen noise. The experiments show that it outperforms existing diffusion-based methods and competes with the representative deep CNN-based methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为NIRNL的鲁棒跨模态学习框架，通过跨模态边界保持和邻居感知实例细化技术，有效处理噪声标注数据，在不同噪声率下均取得优异性能。


<details>

Conclusion: NIRNL框架通过细粒度数据划分和定制化优化策略，能够有效利用所有可用数据并降低噪声影响，为噪声标注下的跨模态检索提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, Cross-Modal Retrieval (CMR) has made significant progress in the field of multi-modal analysis. However, since it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to collect large-scale and well-annotated data, the annotation of multi-modal data inevitably contains some noise. This will degrade the retrieval performance of the model. To tackle the problem, numerous robust CMR methods have been developed, including robust learning paradigms, label calibration strategies, and instance selection mechanisms. Unfortunately, they often fail to simultaneously satisfy model performance ceilings, calibration reliability, and data utilization rate. To overcome the limitations, we propose a novel robust cross-modal learning framework, namely Neighbor-aware Instance Refining with Noisy Labels (NIRNL). Specifically, we first propose Cross-modal Margin Preserving (CMP) to adjust the relative distance between positive and negative pairs, thereby enhancing the discrimination between sample pairs. Then, we propose Neighbor-aware Instance Refining (NIR) to identify pure subset, hard subset, and noisy subset through cross-modal neighborhood consensus. Afterward, we construct different tailored optimization strategies for this fine-grained partitioning, thereby maximizing the utilization of all available data while mitigating error propagation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that NIRNL achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting remarkable robustness, especially under high noise rates.

Abstract: Fine-grained remote sensing datasets often use hierarchical label structures to differentiate objects in a coarse-to-fine manner, with each object annotated across multiple levels. However, embedding this semantic hierarchy into the representation learning space to improve fine-grained detection performance remains challenging. Previous studies have applied supervised contrastive learning at different hierarchical levels to group objects under the same parent class while distinguishing sibling subcategories. Nevertheless, they overlook two critical issues: (1) imbalanced data distribution across the label hierarchy causes high-frequency classes to dominate the learning process, and (2) learning semantic relationships among categories interferes with class-agnostic localization. To address these issues, we propose a balanced hierarchical contrastive loss combined with a decoupled learning strategy within the detection transformer (DETR) framework. The proposed loss introduces learnable class prototypes and equilibrates gradients contributed by different classes at each hierarchical level, ensuring that each hierarchical class contributes equally to the loss computation in every mini-batch. The decoupled strategy separates DETR's object queries into classification and localization sets, enabling task-specific feature extraction and optimization. Experiments on three fine-grained datasets with hierarchical annotations demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: In video and image generation tasks, Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models incur extremely high computational costs due to attention mechanisms, which limits their practical applications. Furthermore, with hardware advancements, a wide range of devices besides graphics processing unit (GPU), such as application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC), have been increasingly adopted for model inference. Sparse attention, which leverages the inherent sparsity of attention by skipping computations for insignificant tokens, is an effective approach to mitigate computational costs. However, existing sparse attention methods have two critical limitations: the overhead of sparse pattern prediction and the lack of hardware generality, as most of these methods are designed for GPU. To address these challenges, this study proposes RainFusion2.0, which aims to develop an online adaptive, hardware-efficient, and low-overhead sparse attention mechanism to accelerate both video and image generative models, with robust performance across diverse hardware platforms. Key technical insights include: (1) leveraging block-wise mean values as representative tokens for sparse mask prediction; (2) implementing spatiotemporal-aware token permutation; and (3) introducing a first-frame sink mechanism specifically designed for video generation scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that RainFusion2.0 can achieve 80% sparsity while achieving an end-to-end speedup of 1.5~1.8x without compromising video quality. Moreover, RainFusion2.0 demonstrates effectiveness across various generative models and validates its generalization across diverse hardware platforms.

Abstract: Recent video-language models have shown great potential for video understanding, but still struggle with accurate temporal grounding for event-level perception. We observe that two main factors in video understanding (i.e., temporal grounding and textual response) form a logical hierarchy: accurate temporal evidence grounding lays the foundation for reliable textual response. However, existing works typically handle these two tasks in a coupled manner without a clear logical structure, leading to sub-optimal objectives. We address this from a factorized learning perspective. We first propose D$^2$VLM, a framework that decouples the learning of these two tasks while also emphasizing their inherent dependency. We adopt a "grounding then answering with evidence referencing" paradigm and introduce evidence tokens for evidence grounding, which emphasize event-level visual semantic capture beyond the focus on timestamp representation in existing works. To further facilitate the learning of these two tasks, we introduce a novel factorized preference optimization (FPO) algorithm. Unlike standard preference optimization, FPO explicitly incorporates probabilistic temporal grounding modeling into the optimization objective, enabling preference learning for both temporal grounding and textual response. We also construct a synthetic dataset to address the lack of suitable datasets for factorized preference learning with explicit temporal grounding. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate the clear advantage of our approach. Our source code is available at https://github.com/nusnlp/d2vlm.

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art paradigms predominantly treat Text-to-Motion (T2M) generation as a direct translation problem, mapping symbolic language directly to continuous poses. While effective for simple actions, this System 1 approach faces a fundamental theoretical bottleneck we identify as the Semantic-Kinematic Impedance Mismatch: the inherent difficulty of grounding semantically dense, discrete linguistic intent into kinematically dense, high-frequency motion data in a single shot. In this paper, we argue that the solution lies in an architectural shift towards Latent System 2 Reasoning. Drawing inspiration from Hierarchical Motor Control in cognitive science, we propose Latent Motion Reasoning (LMR) that reformulates generation as a two-stage Think-then-Act decision process. Central to LMR is a novel Dual-Granularity Tokenizer that disentangles motion into two distinct manifolds: a compressed, semantically rich Reasoning Latent for planning global topology, and a high-frequency Execution Latent for preserving physical fidelity. By forcing the model to autoregressively reason (plan the coarse trajectory) before it moves (instantiates the frames), we effectively bridge the ineffability gap between language and physics. We demonstrate LMR's versatility by implementing it for two representative baselines: T2M-GPT (discrete) and MotionStreamer (continuous). Extensive experiments show that LMR yields non-trivial improvements in both semantic alignment and physical plausibility, validating that the optimal substrate for motion planning is not natural language, but a learned, motion-aligned concept space.

Abstract: Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) serves as a core perception module in autonomous driving systems, but it remains highly susceptible to adversarial attacks. Errors in depth estimation may propagate through downstream decision making and influence overall traffic safety. Existing physical attacks primarily rely on texture-based patches, which impose strict placement constraints and exhibit limited realism, thereby reducing their effectiveness in complex driving environments. To overcome these limitations, this work introduces a training-free generative adversarial attack framework that generates naturalistic, scene-consistent adversarial objects via a diffusion-based conditional generation process. The framework incorporates a Salient Region Selection module that identifies regions most influential to MDE and a Jacobian Vector Product Guidance mechanism that steers adversarial gradients toward update directions supported by the pre-trained diffusion model. This formulation enables the generation of physically plausible adversarial objects capable of inducing substantial adversarial depth shifts. Extensive digital and physical experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing attacks in effectiveness, stealthiness, and physical deployability, underscoring its strong practical implications for autonomous driving safety assessment.

Abstract: Geometric problem solving constitutes a critical branch of mathematical reasoning, requiring precise analysis of shapes and spatial relationships. Current evaluations of geometric reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs) face limitations, including the risk of test data contamination from textbook-based benchmarks, overemphasis on final answers over reasoning processes, and insufficient diagnostic granularity. To address these issues, we present GeoBench, a hierarchical benchmark featuring four reasoning levels in geometric problem-solving: Visual Perception, Goal-Oriented Planning, Rigorous Theorem Application, and Self-Reflective Backtracking. Through six formally verified tasks generated via TrustGeoGen, we systematically assess capabilities ranging from attribute extraction to logical error correction. Experiments reveal that while reasoning models like OpenAI-o3 outperform general MLLMs, performance declines significantly with increasing task complexity. Key findings demonstrate that sub-goal decomposition and irrelevant premise filtering critically influence final problem-solving accuracy, whereas Chain-of-Thought prompting unexpectedly degrades performance in some tasks. These findings establish GeoBench as a comprehensive benchmark while offering actionable guidelines for developing geometric problem-solving systems.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated significant progress in aligning text-to-image diffusion models with human preference via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback. However, while existing methods achieve high scores on automated reward metrics, they often lead to Preference Mode Collapse (PMC)-a specific form of reward hacking where models converge on narrow, high-scoring outputs (e.g., images with monolithic styles or pervasive overexposure), severely degrading generative diversity. In this work, we introduce and quantify this phenomenon, proposing DivGenBench, a novel benchmark designed to measure the extent of PMC. We posit that this collapse is driven by over-optimization along the reward model's inherent biases. Building on this analysis, we propose Directional Decoupling Alignment (D$^2$-Align), a novel framework that mitigates PMC by directionally correcting the reward signal. Specifically, our method first learns a directional correction within the reward model's embedding space while keeping the model frozen. This correction is then applied to the reward signal during the optimization process, preventing the model from collapsing into specific modes and thereby maintaining diversity. Our comprehensive evaluation, combining qualitative analysis with quantitative metrics for both quality and diversity, reveals that D$^2$-Align achieves superior alignment with human preference.

Abstract: We present IMDD-1M, the first large-scale Industrial Multimodal Defect Dataset comprising 1,000,000 aligned image-text pairs, designed to advance multimodal learning for manufacturing and quality inspection. IMDD-1M contains high-resolution real-world defects spanning over 60 material categories and more than 400 defect types, each accompanied by expert-verified annotations and fine-grained textual descriptions detailing defect location, severity, and contextual attributes. This dataset enables a wide spectrum of applications, including classification, segmentation, retrieval, captioning, and generative modeling. Building upon IMDD-1M, we train a diffusion-based vision-language foundation model from scratch, specifically tailored for industrial scenarios. The model serves as a generalizable foundation that can be efficiently adapted to specialized domains through lightweight fine-tuning. With less than 5% of the task-specific data required by dedicated expert models, it achieves comparable performance, highlighting the potential of data-efficient foundation model adaptation for industrial inspection and generation, paving the way for scalable, domain-adaptive, and knowledge-grounded manufacturing intelligence.

Abstract: While recent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have attained significant strides in multimodal reasoning, their reasoning processes remain predominantly text-centric, leading to suboptimal performance in complex long-horizon, vision-centric tasks. In this paper, we establish a novel Generative Multimodal Reasoning paradigm and introduce DiffThinker, a diffusion-based reasoning framework. Conceptually, DiffThinker reformulates multimodal reasoning as a native generative image-to-image task, achieving superior logical consistency and spatial precision in vision-centric tasks. We perform a systematic comparison between DiffThinker and MLLMs, providing the first in-depth investigation into the intrinsic characteristics of this paradigm, revealing four core properties: efficiency, controllability, native parallelism, and collaboration. Extensive experiments across four domains (sequential planning, combinatorial optimization, constraint satisfaction, and spatial configuration) demonstrate that DiffThinker significantly outperforms leading closed source models including GPT-5 (+314.2\%) and Gemini-3-Flash (+111.6\%), as well as the fine-tuned Qwen3-VL-32B baseline (+39.0\%), highlighting generative multimodal reasoning as a promising approach for vision-centric reasoning.

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) analysis faces computational bottlenecks due to massive data volumes that exceed available memory. While foundation models pre-trained on large remote sensing datasets show promise, their learned representations often fail to transfer to domain-specific applications like close-range agricultural monitoring where spectral signatures, spatial scales, and semantic targets differ fundamentally. This report presents Deep Global Clustering (DGC), a conceptual framework for memory-efficient HSI segmentation that learns global clustering structure from local patch observations without pre-training. DGC operates on small patches with overlapping regions to enforce consistency, enabling training in under 30 minutes on consumer hardware while maintaining constant memory usage. On a leaf disease dataset, DGC achieves background-tissue separation (mean IoU 0.925) and demonstrates unsupervised disease detection through navigable semantic granularity. However, the framework suffers from optimization instability rooted in multi-objective loss balancing: meaningful representations emerge rapidly but degrade due to cluster over-merging in feature space. We position this work as intellectual scaffolding - the design philosophy has merit, but stable implementation requires principled approaches to dynamic loss balancing.

*Xingyu Zhou,Qifan Li,Xiaobin Hu,Hai Chen,Shuhang Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了内部引导（IG）策略，通过训练时在中间层引入辅助监督，采样时外推中间与深层输出来提升生成质量和训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在捕捉完整数据分布时，由于缺乏足够训练数据和能力覆盖低概率区域，导致生成对应区域的高质量图像受限。传统指导策略如CFG在采样时引导样本到高概率区域，但容易产生过简化或扭曲的样本；而通过劣化版本引导的方法则需要精心设计的劣化策略、额外训练和采样步骤。

Method: 提出了内部引导（IG）策略：1. 训练过程中在模型的中间层引入辅助监督，帮助模型更好地学习数据分布。2. 采样过程中，通过外推中间层和深层输出，获得更好的生成结果。这种方法简单且在多种基线模型上有效。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256数据集上，SiT-XL/2+IG模型在80和800轮训练时分别达到FID=5.31和1.75；更显著的是，LightningDiT-XL/1+IG达到FID=1.34，大幅领先其他方法；结合CFG后，LightningDiT-XL/1+IG取得了当前最优的FID=1.19。

Conclusion: 内部引导（IG）作为一种简单有效的策略，通过引入中间层辅助监督和输出外推，显著提升了扩散模型的训练效率和生成质量。实验表明其在多个基线模型上具有广泛适用性，并能够与CFG结合达到最先进的生成性能。

Abstract: The diffusion model presents a powerful ability to capture the entire (conditional) data distribution. However, due to the lack of sufficient training and data to learn to cover low-probability areas, the model will be penalized for failing to generate high-quality images corresponding to these areas. To achieve better generation quality, guidance strategies such as classifier free guidance (CFG) can guide the samples to the high-probability areas during the sampling stage. However, the standard CFG often leads to over-simplified or distorted samples. On the other hand, the alternative line of guiding diffusion model with its bad version is limited by carefully designed degradation strategies, extra training and additional sampling steps. In this paper, we proposed a simple yet effective strategy Internal Guidance (IG), which introduces an auxiliary supervision on the intermediate layer during training process and extrapolates the intermediate and deep layer's outputs to obtain generative results during sampling process. This simple strategy yields significant improvements in both training efficiency and generation quality on various baselines. On ImageNet 256x256, SiT-XL/2+IG achieves FID=5.31 and FID=1.75 at 80 and 800 epochs. More impressively, LightningDiT-XL/1+IG achieves FID=1.34 which achieves a large margin between all of these methods. Combined with CFG, LightningDiT-XL/1+IG achieves the current state-of-the-art FID of 1.19.

TL;DR: CorGi是一种无需训练即可加速DiT推理的框架，通过选择性重用Diffusion Transformer中低贡献度块的输出来减少跨去噪步骤的冗余计算。CorGi+进一步利用跨注意力图识别关键token以保护重要细节。两者可实现最高2.0倍加速，同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Diffusion Transformer具有优异的视觉生成能力，但其迭代去噪过程结合大模型容量导致推理成本过高。现有研究表明DiT在迭代过程中存在大量跨步骤的冗余计算。本文旨在有效减少DiT中的冗余计算，提出免训练的推理加速框架。

Method: 提出了CorGi框架：1）计算各transformer块的贡献度，选择性缓存低贡献度块并在后续步骤中重用；2）CorGi+针对文本到图像任务，利用跨注意力图识别显著token，应用部分注意力更新保护重要对象细节。两者均为免训练方法。

Result: 在最先进的DiT模型上评估显示，CorGi和CorGi+平均可实现高达2.0倍的加速，同时能保持高质量的生成结果。

Conclusion: 通过贡献度引导的块级间隔缓存，CorGi有效减少了DiT的冗余计算，实现了显著的推理加速，且无需额外训练。CorGi+进一步优化了文本到图像任务中的细节保持能力。该方法为DiT的高效推理提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion transformer (DiT) achieves remarkable performance in visual generation, but its iterative denoising process combined with larger capacity leads to a high inference cost. Recent works have demonstrated that the iterative denoising process of DiT models involves substantial redundant computation across steps. To effectively reduce the redundant computation in DiT, we propose CorGi (Contribution-Guided Block-Wise Interval Caching), training-free DiT inference acceleration framework that selectively reuses the outputs of transformer blocks in DiT across denoising steps. CorGi caches low-contribution blocks and reuses them in later steps within each interval to reduce redundant computation while preserving generation quality. For text-to-image tasks, we further propose CorGi+, which leverages per-block cross-attention maps to identify salient tokens and applies partial attention updates to protect important object details. Evaluation on the state-of-the-art DiT models demonstrates that CorGi and CorGi+ achieve up to 2.0x speedup on average, while preserving high generation quality.

*Ziquan Liu,Zhewei Zhu,Xuyang Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Open-vocabulary语义分割的现有免训练方法存在计算昂贵或性能欠佳的问题。作者提出注意力优化模块(ARM)，一个轻量级可学习模块，通过自适应融合CLIP的层次特征来提升其像素级细节能力，采用'训练一次，处处可用'的范式，在各类免训练框架上都能带来显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于CLIP的开放词汇语义分割面临根本性挑战：CLIP的粗粒度图像级表示缺乏精确的像素级细节。现有免训练方法要么依赖昂贵的外部基模型（如SAM、DINO），要么对CLIP内部特征使用静态启发式方法，这些方法要么计算成本高，要么效果不理想。

Method: 提出注意力优化模块(ARM)，这是一个轻量级可学习模块。它采用语义引导的交叉注意力机制，利用鲁棒的深层特征(K, V)来选择并优化富含细节的浅层特征(Q)，然后通过自注意力块进行进一步细化。关键创新是'训练一次，处处可用'的范式：在通用数据集（如COCO-Stuff）上训练一次后，ARM可以作为通用即插即用的后处理器应用于各种免训练框架。

Result: 大量实验表明，ARM能够在多个基准测试上持续提升基线性能，且推理开销可忽略不计。这为免训练开放词汇语义分割建立了高效且有效的范式。

Conclusion: ARM通过自适应融合CLIP的层次特征，有效释放和优化了CLIP的内部潜力，相比静态融合方法具有显著优势。其'训练一次，处处可用'的范式使其成为解决免训练开放词汇语义分割问题的高效方案。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) is fundamentally hampered by the coarse, image-level representations of CLIP, which lack precise pixel-level details. Existing training-free methods attempt to resolve this by either importing priors from costly external foundation models (e.g., SAM, DINO) or by applying static, hand-crafted heuristics to CLIP's internal features. These approaches are either computationally expensive or sub-optimal. We propose the Attention Refinement Module (ARM), a lightweight, learnable module that effectively unlocks and refines CLIP's internal potential. Unlike static-fusion methods, ARM learns to adaptively fuse hierarchical features. It employs a semantically-guided cross-attention block, using robust deep features (K, V) to select and refine detail-rich shallow features (Q), followed by a self-attention block. The key innovation lies in a ``train once, use anywhere" paradigm. Trained once on a general-purpose dataset (e.g., COCO-Stuff), ARM acts as a universal plug-and-play post-processor for diverse training-free frameworks. Extensive experiments show that ARM consistently boosts baseline performance on multiple benchmarks with negligible inference overhead, establishing an efficient and effective paradigm for training-free OVSS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频对象编辑方法在保持高视觉逼真度和时序一致性方面存在困难，而自动驾驶系统需要多样化且可扩展的训练数据来提升鲁棒性

Method: 基于文本到视频扩散先验确保时序一致性；通过预训练的2D编码器注入时序无关特征以恢复细节；采用两阶段数据对齐策略（粗糙3D对齐+精细2D优化）解决姿态不对齐问题

Result: Mirage在各种编辑场景中实现了高真实感和时序一致性，并能推广应用至其他视频到视频转换任务

Conclusion: Mirage提供了一种有效的自动驾驶场景资产编辑方法，可作为未来研究的可靠基线

Abstract: Vision-centric autonomous driving systems rely on diverse and scalable training data to achieve robust performance. While video object editing offers a promising path for data augmentation, existing methods often struggle to maintain both high visual fidelity and temporal coherence. In this work, we propose \textbf{Mirage}, a one-step video diffusion model for photorealistic and coherent asset editing in driving scenes. Mirage builds upon a text-to-video diffusion prior to ensure temporal consistency across frames. However, 3D causal variational autoencoders often suffer from degraded spatial fidelity due to compression, and directly passing 3D encoder features to decoder layers breaks temporal causality. To address this, we inject temporally agnostic latents from a pretrained 2D encoder into the 3D decoder to restore detail while preserving causal structures. Furthermore, because scene objects and inserted assets are optimized under different objectives, their Gaussians exhibit a distribution mismatch that leads to pose misalignment. To mitigate this, we introduce a two-stage data alignment strategy combining coarse 3D alignment and fine 2D refinement, thereby improving alignment and providing cleaner supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mirage achieves high realism and temporal consistency across diverse editing scenarios. Beyond asset editing, Mirage can also generalize to other video-to-video translation tasks, serving as a reliable baseline for future research.

Conclusion: MambaSeg为高效、可扩展、鲁棒的多模态感知提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision with wide-ranging applications, including autonomous driving and robotics. While RGB-based methods have achieved strong performance with CNNs and Transformers, their effectiveness degrades under fast motion, low-light, or high dynamic range conditions due to limitations of frame cameras. Event cameras offer complementary advantages such as high temporal resolution and low latency, yet lack color and texture, making them insufficient on their own. To address this, recent research has explored multimodal fusion of RGB and event data; however, many existing approaches are computationally expensive and focus primarily on spatial fusion, neglecting the temporal dynamics inherent in event streams. In this work, we propose MambaSeg, a novel dual-branch semantic segmentation framework that employs parallel Mamba encoders to efficiently model RGB images and event streams. To reduce cross-modal ambiguity, we introduce the Dual-Dimensional Interaction Module (DDIM), comprising a Cross-Spatial Interaction Module (CSIM) and a Cross-Temporal Interaction Module (CTIM), which jointly perform fine-grained fusion along both spatial and temporal dimensions. This design improves cross-modal alignment, reduces ambiguity, and leverages the complementary properties of each modality. Extensive experiments on the DDD17 and DSEC datasets demonstrate that MambaSeg achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance while significantly reducing computational cost, showcasing its promise for efficient, scalable, and robust multimodal perception.

Abstract: Metal artifacts in Dental CBCT severely obscure anatomical structures, hindering diagnosis. Current deep learning for Metal Artifact Reduction (MAR) faces limitations: supervised methods suffer from spectral blurring due to "regression-to-the-mean", while unsupervised ones risk structural hallucinations. Denoising Diffusion Models (DDPMs) offer realism but rely on slow, stochastic iterative sampling, unsuitable for clinical use. To resolve this, we propose the Physically-Grounded Manifold Projection (PGMP) framework. First, our Anatomically-Adaptive Physics Simulation (AAPS) pipeline synthesizes high-fidelity training pairs via Monte Carlo spectral modeling and patient-specific digital twins, bridging the synthetic-to-real gap. Second, our DMP-Former adapts the Direct x-Prediction paradigm, reformulating restoration as a deterministic manifold projection to recover clean anatomy in a single forward pass, eliminating stochastic sampling. Finally, a Semantic-Structural Alignment (SSA) module anchors the solution using priors from medical foundation models (MedDINOv3), ensuring clinical plausibility. Experiments on synthetic and multi-center clinical datasets show PGMP outperforms state-of-the-art methods on unseen anatomy, setting new benchmarks in efficiency and diagnostic reliability.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in video understanding. However, they suffer from a critical vulnerability: an over-reliance on language priors, which can lead to visual ungrounded hallucinations, especially when processing counterfactual videos that defy common sense. This limitation, stemming from the intrinsic data imbalance between text and video, is challenging to address due to the substantial cost of collecting and annotating counterfactual data. To address this, we introduce DualityForge, a novel counterfactual data synthesis framework that employs controllable, diffusion-based video editing to transform real-world videos into counterfactual scenarios. By embedding structured contextual information into the video editing and QA generation processes, the framework automatically produces high-quality QA pairs together with original-edited video pairs for contrastive training. Based on this, we build DualityVidQA, a large-scale video dataset designed to reduce MLLM hallucinations. In addition, to fully exploit the contrastive nature of our paired data, we propose Duality-Normalized Advantage Training (DNA-Train), a two-stage SFT-RL training regime where the RL phase applies pair-wise $\ell_1$ advantage normalization, thereby enabling a more stable and efficient policy optimization. Experiments on DualityVidQA-Test demonstrate that our method substantially reduces model hallucinations on counterfactual videos, yielding a relative improvement of 24.0% over the Qwen2.5-VL-7B baseline. Moreover, our approach achieves significant gains across both hallucination and general-purpose benchmarks, indicating strong generalization capability. We will open-source our dataset and code.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将图像拼接从二维变形范式重构为三维一致性范式的新方法，通过三维点表示、全局跨视图融合和球面投影来减少大幅视差和复杂遮挡下的几何失真和重影现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的二维单应性变换和网格变形方法在真实三维场景（包含多个深度层和遮挡）中容易产生重影、结构弯曲和拉伸失真，特别是在多视角累积和360°闭环拼接场景中问题更加严重。

Method: 1) 将输入图像提升为统一坐标系下的密集三维点表示，基于置信度进行全局跨视图融合；2) 在三维空间中建立统一的投影中心，采用等距柱面投影将融合后的点映射到全景流形上；3) 在画布域进行空洞填充以解决视角变换带来的未知区域问题。

Result: 实验评估表明，该方法在大幅视差和复杂遮挡场景下显著减少了几何失真和重影现象，产生了更加自然和一致的拼接全景图像。

Conclusion: 该研究将图像拼接从二维变形范式转变为三维一致性范式，设计了一个灵活融合各种三维重建和补全模块的框架，在解决真实三维场景拼接失真问题上取得了显著进展。

Abstract: Traditional image stitching techniques have predominantly utilized two-dimensional homography transformations and mesh warping to achieve alignment on a planar surface. While effective for scenes that are approximately coplanar or exhibit minimal parallax, these approaches often result in ghosting, structural bending, and stretching distortions in non-overlapping regions when applied to real three-dimensional scenes characterized by multiple depth layers and occlusions. Such challenges are exacerbated in multi-view accumulations and 360° closed-loop stitching scenarios. In response, this study introduces a spatially lifted panoramic stitching framework that initially elevates each input image into a dense three-dimensional point representation within a unified coordinate system, facilitating global cross-view fusion augmented by confidence metrics. Subsequently, a unified projection center is established in three-dimensional space, and an equidistant cylindrical projection is employed to map the fused data onto a single panoramic manifold, thereby producing a geometrically consistent 360° panoramic layout. Finally, hole filling is conducted within the canvas domain to address unknown regions revealed by viewpoint transitions, restoring continuous texture and semantic coherence. This framework reconceptualizes stitching from a two-dimensional warping paradigm to a three-dimensional consistency paradigm and is designed to flexibly incorporate various three-dimensional lifting and completion modules. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method substantially mitigates geometric distortions and ghosting artifacts in scenarios involving significant parallax and complex occlusions, yielding panoramic results that are more natural and consistent.

Abstract: Robust preprocessing is rarely quantified in deep-learning pipelines for low-dose CT (LDCT) lung cancer screening. We develop and validate Virtual-Eyes, a clinically motivated 16-bit CT quality-control pipeline, and measure its differential impact on generalist foundation models versus specialist models. Virtual-Eyes enforces strict 512x512 in-plane resolution, rejects short or non-diagnostic series, and extracts a contiguous lung block using Hounsfield-unit filtering and bilateral lung-coverage scoring while preserving the native 16-bit grid. Using 765 NLST patients (182 cancer, 583 non-cancer), we compute slice-level embeddings from RAD-DINO and Merlin with frozen encoders and train leakage-free patient-level MLP heads; we also evaluate Sybil and a 2D ResNet-18 baseline under Raw versus Virtual-Eyes inputs without backbone retraining. Virtual-Eyes improves RAD-DINO slice-level AUC from 0.576 to 0.610 and patient-level AUC from 0.646 to 0.683 (mean pooling) and from 0.619 to 0.735 (max pooling), with improved calibration (Brier score 0.188 to 0.112). In contrast, Sybil and ResNet-18 degrade under Virtual-Eyes (Sybil AUC 0.886 to 0.837; ResNet-18 AUC 0.571 to 0.596) with evidence of context dependence and shortcut learning, and Merlin shows limited transferability (AUC approximately 0.507 to 0.567) regardless of preprocessing. These results demonstrate that anatomically targeted QC can stabilize and improve generalist foundation-model workflows but may disrupt specialist models adapted to raw clinical context.

Abstract: A long-standing objective in humanoid robotics is the realization of versatile agents capable of following diverse multimodal instructions with human-level flexibility. Despite advances in humanoid control, bridging high-level multimodal perception with whole-body execution remains a significant bottleneck. Existing methods often struggle to translate heterogeneous instructions -- such as language, music, and trajectories -- into stable, real-time actions. Here we show that UniAct, a two-stage framework integrating a fine-tuned MLLM with a causal streaming pipeline, enables humanoid robots to execute multimodal instructions with sub-500 ms latency. By unifying inputs through a shared discrete codebook via FSQ, UniAct ensures cross-modal alignment while constraining motions to a physically grounded manifold. This approach yields a 19% improvement in the success rate of zero-shot tracking of imperfect reference motions. We validate UniAct on UniMoCap, our 20-hour humanoid motion benchmark, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse real-world scenarios. Our results mark a critical step toward responsive, general-purpose humanoid assistants capable of seamless interaction through unified perception and control.

Motivation: 解决Ego-RVOS任务中现有模型存在的问题，包括训练数据中对象-动作配对的虚假相关性、以自我为中心视角下快速运动和频繁遮挡等基本视觉混淆因素导致的模型性能低下。

Method: 提出了一个可插拔的因果框架CERES，采用双模态因果干预：1）对语言表示偏见应用后门调整原理，2）利用前门调整概念，通过因果原则指导将语义视觉特征与几何深度信息智能整合，解决视觉混淆问题。

Result: 在Ego-RVOS基准测试中取得了最先进的性能，证明因果推理能显著提高模型在egocentric视频理解任务中的可靠性。

Conclusion: CERES展示了因果推理在构建更可靠的egocentric视频理解模型方面的潜力，通过双模态因果干预有效解决了该领域的关键技术挑战。

Abstract: Egocentric Referring Video Object Segmentation (Ego-RVOS) aims to segment the specific object actively involved in a human action, as described by a language query, within first-person videos. This task is critical for understanding egocentric human behavior. However, achieving such segmentation robustly is challenging due to ambiguities inherent in egocentric videos and biases present in training data. Consequently, existing methods often struggle, learning spurious correlations from skewed object-action pairings in datasets and fundamental visual confounding factors of the egocentric perspective, such as rapid motion and frequent occlusions. To address these limitations, we introduce Causal Ego-REferring Segmentation (CERES), a plug-in causal framework that adapts strong, pre-trained RVOS backbones to the egocentric domain. CERES implements dual-modal causal intervention: applying backdoor adjustment principles to counteract language representation biases learned from dataset statistics, and leveraging front-door adjustment concepts to address visual confounding by intelligently integrating semantic visual features with geometric depth information guided by causal principles, creating representations more robust to egocentric distortions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CERES achieves state-of-the-art performance on Ego-RVOS benchmarks, highlighting the potential of applying causal reasoning to build more reliable models for broader egocentric video understanding.

Motivation: 当前基于图像的视觉语言模型在自动驾驶场景中缺乏准确的度量空间推理和几何推断能力，导致驾驶策略不可靠，而LiDAR可提供精确的3D空间信息，因此需要融合多模态数据以提升模型的场景理解与决策能力。

Method: 提出LVLDrive框架，在预训练的VLM中逐步融入LiDAR点云特征，采用渐进融合Q-Former模块缓解3D数据对模型知识的干扰，并构建空间感知问答数据集(SA-QA)来显式训练模型的3D感知与推理能力。

Conclusion: 研究表明，显式的3D度量数据对于构建可信赖的基于VLM的自动驾驶系统至关重要，LVLDrive通过LiDAR-Vision-Language的多模态融合有效提升了模型的3D空间理解与决策可靠性。

Abstract: While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show significant promise for end-to-end autonomous driving by leveraging the common sense embedded in language models, their reliance on 2D image cues for complex scene understanding and decision-making presents a critical bottleneck for safety and reliability. Current image-based methods struggle with accurate metric spatial reasoning and geometric inference, leading to unreliable driving policies. To bridge this gap, we propose LVLDrive (LiDAR-Vision-Language), a novel framework specifically designed to upgrade existing VLMs with robust 3D metric spatial understanding for autonomous driving by incoperating LiDAR point cloud as an extra input modality. A key challenge lies in mitigating the catastrophic disturbance introduced by disparate 3D data to the pre-trained VLMs. To this end, we introduce a Gradual Fusion Q-Former that incrementally injects LiDAR features, ensuring the stability and preservation of the VLM's existing knowledge base. Furthermore, we develop a spatial-aware question-answering (SA-QA) dataset to explicitly teach the model advanced 3D perception and reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on driving benchmarks demonstrate that LVLDrive achieves superior performance compared to vision-only counterparts across scene understanding, metric spatial perception, and reliable driving decision-making. Our work highlights the necessity of explicit 3D metric data for building trustworthy VLM-based autonomous systems.

Abstract: This paper proposes elementary information mechanics as a new model for understanding the mechanical properties of convolutional filtering with rectification, inspired by physical theories of special relativity and quantum mechanics. We consider kernels decomposed into orthogonal even and odd components. Even components cause image content to diffuse isotropically while preserving the center of mass, analogously to rest or potential energy with zero net momentum. Odd kernels cause directional displacement of the center of mass, analogously to kinetic energy with non-zero momentum. The speed of information displacement is linearly related to the ratio of odd vs total kernel energy. Even-Odd properties are analyzed in the spectral domain via the discrete cosine transform (DCT), where the structure of small convolutional filters (e.g. $3 \times 3$ pixels) is dominated by low-frequency bases, specifically the DC $Σ$ and gradient components $\nabla$, which define the fundamental modes of information propagation. To our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating the link between information processing in generic CNNs and the energy-momentum relation, a cornerstone of modern relativistic physics.

TL;DR: 我们介绍了DermaVQA-DAS数据集及其Dermatology Assessment Schema（DAS）框架，支持皮肤病变分割和封闭式问答任务，以弥补现有数据集中缺乏患者查询和临床背景的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有皮肤图像分析数据集多聚焦于皮肤镜检查，缺乏患者自述的查询和临床上下文，限制了它们在患者中心护理中的应用。因此，我们需要一个结合患者查询、临床语境和标准化评估体系的数据集。

Method: 开发了Dermatology Assessment Schema（DAS）框架，包含36个高层次和27个细粒度的评估问题（中英双语）。基于此构建了DermaVQA-DAS数据集，为分割任务评估了多种提示策略，为封闭式QA任务测试了多模态模型。

Result: 分割任务中，默认提示在Mean-of-Max和Mean-of-Mean聚合方案下表现最佳；增强提示（含患者查询的标题和内容）在多数投票评估下获得最高性能（Jaccard指数0.395，Dice分数0.566）。封闭式QA任务中，各模型平均准确率在0.729-0.798之间，o3模型表现最佳（0.798），GPT-4.1紧随其后（0.796）。

Conclusion: DermaVQA-DAS及DAS框架的发布，通过标准化评估体系和多语言支持，有望促进以患者为中心的皮肤科视觉语言建模研究。数据集和评估协议已公开。

Abstract: Recent advances in dermatological image analysis have been driven by large-scale annotated datasets; however, most existing benchmarks focus on dermatoscopic images and lack patient-authored queries and clinical context, limiting their applicability to patient-centered care. To address this gap, we introduce DermaVQA-DAS, an extension of the DermaVQA dataset that supports two complementary tasks: closed-ended question answering (QA) and dermatological lesion segmentation. Central to this work is the Dermatology Assessment Schema (DAS), a novel expert-developed framework that systematically captures clinically meaningful dermatological features in a structured and standardized form. DAS comprises 36 high-level and 27 fine-grained assessment questions, with multiple-choice options in English and Chinese. Leveraging DAS, we provide expert-annotated datasets for both closed QA and segmentation and benchmark state-of-the-art multimodal models. For segmentation, we evaluate multiple prompting strategies and show that prompt design impacts performance: the default prompt achieves the best results under Mean-of-Max and Mean-of-Mean evaluation aggregation schemes, while an augmented prompt incorporating both patient query title and content yields the highest performance under majority-vote-based microscore evaluation, achieving a Jaccard index of 0.395 and a Dice score of 0.566 with BiomedParse. For closed-ended QA, overall performance is strong across models, with average accuracies ranging from 0.729 to 0.798; o3 achieves the best overall accuracy (0.798), closely followed by GPT-4.1 (0.796), while Gemini-1.5-Pro shows competitive performance within the Gemini family (0.783). We publicly release DermaVQA-DAS, the DAS schema, and evaluation protocols to support and accelerate future research in patient-centered dermatological vision-language modeling (https://osf.io/72rp3).

Abstract: The rapid advancement of autonomous systems, including self-driving vehicles and drones, has intensified the need to forge true Spatial Intelligence from multi-modal onboard sensor data. While foundation models excel in single-modal contexts, integrating their capabilities across diverse sensors like cameras and LiDAR to create a unified understanding remains a formidable challenge. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for multi-modal pre-training, identifying the core set of techniques driving progress toward this goal. We dissect the interplay between foundational sensor characteristics and learning strategies, evaluating the role of platform-specific datasets in enabling these advancements. Our central contribution is the formulation of a unified taxonomy for pre-training paradigms: ranging from single-modality baselines to sophisticated unified frameworks that learn holistic representations for advanced tasks like 3D object detection and semantic occupancy prediction. Furthermore, we investigate the integration of textual inputs and occupancy representations to facilitate open-world perception and planning. Finally, we identify critical bottlenecks, such as computational efficiency and model scalability, and propose a roadmap toward general-purpose multi-modal foundation models capable of achieving robust Spatial Intelligence for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: DMSS系统通过动态选择模型大小来降低视频推理成本，但缺乏通用性。我们开发了RedunCut系统，改善了采样和准确度预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DMSS系统在低画质的移动设备和设定更低的精度指标时表现欠佳，主要是因为采样策略不够高效和每段视频精度预测不够准确。

Method: 通过测量驱动规划器评估采样的损益平衡，并使用轻量级机器学习模型来预测精度，以改进现有DMSS的不足。

Result: 与原有系统相比，RedunCut在不同视频源（车载、无人机、监控视频）和多模型任务中，将固定精度下的算力成本降低了14%至62%，且对历史数据和漂移表现出良好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RedunCut通过改进采样策略和精度预测方法，在维持精度标准的同时，显著降低了视频分析的云推理算力消耗。

Abstract: Live video analytics (LVA) runs continuously across massive camera fleets, but inference cost with modern vision models remains high. To address this, dynamic model size selection (DMSS) is an attractive approach: it is content-aware but treats models as black boxes, and could potentially reduce cost by up to 10x without model retraining or modification. Without ground truth labels at runtime, we observe that DMSS methods use two stages per segment: (i) sampling a few models to calculate prediction statistics (e.g., confidences), then (ii) selection of the model size from those statistics. Prior systems fail to generalize to diverse workloads, particularly to mobile videos and lower accuracy targets. We identify that the failure modes stem from inefficient sampling whose cost exceeds its benefit, and inaccurate per-segment accuracy prediction.
  In this work, we present RedunCut, a new DMSS system that addresses both: It uses a measurement-driven planner that estimates the cost-benefit tradeoff of sampling, and a lightweight, data-driven performance model to improve accuracy prediction. Across road-vehicle, drone, and surveillance videos and multiple model families and tasks, RedunCut reduces compute cost by 14-62% at fixed accuracy and remains robust to limited historical data and to drift.

Abstract: Generating realistic, dyadic talking head video requires ultra-low latency. Existing chunk-based methods require full non-causal context windows, introducing significant delays. This high latency critically prevents the immediate, non-verbal feedback required for a realistic listener. To address this, we present DyStream, a flow matching-based autoregressive model that could generate video in real-time from both speaker and listener audio. Our method contains two key designs: (1) we adopt a stream-friendly autoregressive framework with flow-matching heads for probabilistic modeling, and (2) We propose a causal encoder enhanced by a lookahead module to incorporate short future context (e.g., 60 ms) to improve quality while maintaining low latency. Our analysis shows this simple-and-effective method significantly surpass alternative causal strategies, including distillation and generative encoder. Extensive experiments show that DyStream could generate video within 34 ms per frame, guaranteeing the entire system latency remains under 100 ms. Besides, it achieves state-of-the-art lip-sync quality, with offline and online LipSync Confidence scores of 8.13 and 7.61 on HDTF, respectively. The model, weights and codes are available.

Motivation: 传统手术技能评估依赖专家监督，存在主观性、耗时且难以标准化，特别是在中低收入国家难以推广，需要自动化、客观的评估方法

Method: 采用基于TimeSformer的改进视频Transformer架构，加入分层时间注意力和加权空间注意力机制进行动作识别；使用YOLO进行目标检测和跟踪提取运动特征；从五个技能维度评估微吻合术表现

Result: 在58个专家标注视频数据集上验证，动作分割帧级准确率达87.7%（后处理后提升至93.62%），在复制专家评估所有技能维度的平均分类准确率为76%

Conclusion: 该系统能提供客观、一致且可解释的反馈，有望实现更标准化、数据驱动的手术教育培训评估

Abstract: The development of effective training and evaluation strategies is critical. Conventional methods for assessing surgical proficiency typically rely on expert supervision, either through onsite observation or retrospective analysis of recorded procedures. However, these approaches are inherently subjective, susceptible to inter-rater variability, and require substantial time and effort from expert surgeons. These demands are often impractical in low- and middle-income countries, thereby limiting the scalability and consistency of such methods across training programs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel AI-driven framework for the automated assessment of microanastomosis performance. The system integrates a video transformer architecture based on TimeSformer, improved with hierarchical temporal attention and weighted spatial attention mechanisms, to achieve accurate action recognition within surgical videos. Fine-grained motion features are then extracted using a YOLO-based object detection and tracking method, allowing for detailed analysis of instrument kinematics. Performance is evaluated along five aspects of microanastomosis skill, including overall action execution, motion quality during procedure-critical actions, and general instrument handling. Experimental validation using a dataset of 58 expert-annotated videos demonstrates the effectiveness of the system, achieving 87.7% frame-level accuracy in action segmentation that increased to 93.62% with post-processing, and an average classification accuracy of 76% in replicating expert assessments across all skill aspects. These findings highlight the system's potential to provide objective, consistent, and interpretable feedback, thereby enabling more standardized, data-driven training and evaluation in surgical education.

Motivation: 本文旨在探究Vision Transformer (ViT)编码器是否体现出组合性表示，现有研究主要从语言任务角度分析Transformer模型的工作机制，而在视觉领域中ViT如何学习组合性表示尚不清楚。

Method: 提出一个框架，借鉴先前在表示学习中的组合性度量方法，并将离散小波变换（DWT）作为获取视觉输入依赖的原语的工具，通过分析组合表示能否重构原始图像表示，来经验性地测试表示空间中的组合性程度。

Conclusion: 研究工作表明ViT编码器在表示空间中具有一定的组合性特征，这为理解ViT如何处理与组织视觉信息提供了新的视角。

Abstract: While insights into the workings of the transformer model have largely emerged by analysing their behaviour on language tasks, this work investigates the representations learnt by the Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder through the lens of compositionality. We introduce a framework, analogous to prior work on measuring compositionality in representation learning, to test for compositionality in the ViT encoder. Crucial to drawing this analogy is the Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), which is a simple yet effective tool for obtaining input-dependent primitives in the vision setting. By examining the ability of composed representations to reproduce original image representations, we empirically test the extent to which compositionality is respected in the representation space. Our findings show that primitives from a one-level DWT decomposition produce encoder representations that approximately compose in latent space, offering a new perspective on how ViTs structure information.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed medical imaging, with computer vision (CV) systems achieving state-of-the-art performance in classification and detection tasks. However, these systems typically output structured predictions, leaving radiologists responsible for translating results into full narrative reports. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, offer new opportunities to bridge this gap by generating diagnostic narratives from structured findings. This study introduces a pipeline that integrates YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for anomaly detection in chest X-ray images with a large language model (LLM) to generate natural-language radiology reports. The YOLO models produce bounding-box predictions and class labels, which are then passed to the LLM to generate descriptive findings and clinical summaries. YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 are compared in terms of detection accuracy, inference latency, and the quality of generated text, as measured by cosine similarity to ground-truth reports. Results show strong semantic similarity between AI and human reports, while human evaluation reveals GPT-4 excels in clarity (4.88/5) but exhibits lower scores for natural writing flow (2.81/5), indicating that current systems achieve clinical accuracy but remain stylistically distinguishable from radiologist-authored text.

Abstract: The exponential growth of video traffic has placed increasing demands on bandwidth and storage infrastructure, particularly for content delivery networks (CDNs) and edge devices. While traditional video codecs like H.264 and HEVC achieve high compression ratios, they are designed primarily for pixel-domain reconstruction and lack native support for machine learning-centric latent representations, limiting their integration into deep learning pipelines. In this work, we present a Multi-Scale Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MS-VQ-VAE) designed to generate compact, high-fidelity latent representations of low-resolution video, suitable for efficient storage, transmission, and client-side decoding. Our architecture extends the VQ-VAE-2 framework to a spatiotemporal setting, introducing a two-level hierarchical latent structure built with 3D residual convolutions. The model is lightweight (approximately 18.5M parameters) and optimized for 64x64 resolution video clips, making it appropriate for deployment on edge devices with constrained compute and memory resources. To improve perceptual reconstruction quality, we incorporate a perceptual loss derived from a pre-trained VGG16 network. Trained on the UCF101 dataset using 2-second video clips (32 frames at 16 FPS), on the test set we achieve 25.96 dB PSNR and 0.8375 SSIM. On validation, our model improves over the single-scale baseline by 1.41 dB PSNR and 0.0248 SSIM. The proposed framework is well-suited for scalable video compression in bandwidth-sensitive scenarios, including real-time streaming, mobile video analytics, and CDN-level storage optimization.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation have achieved good visual quality, yet synthesizing videos that faithfully follow physical laws remains an open challenge. Existing methods mainly based on graphics or prompt extension struggle to generalize beyond simple simulated environments or learn implicit physical reasoning. The scarcity of training data with rich physics interactions and phenomena is also a problem. In this paper, we first introduce a Physics-Augmented video data construction Pipeline, PhyAugPipe, that leverages a vision-language model (VLM) with chain-of-thought reasoning to collect a large-scale training dataset, PhyVidGen-135K. Then we formulate a principled Physics-aware Groupwise Direct Preference Optimization, PhyGDPO, framework that builds upon the groupwise Plackett-Luce probabilistic model to capture holistic preferences beyond pairwise comparisons. In PhyGDPO, we design a Physics-Guided Rewarding (PGR) scheme that embeds VLM-based physics rewards to steer optimization toward physical consistency. We also propose a LoRA-Switch Reference (LoRA-SR) scheme that eliminates memory-heavy reference duplication for efficient training. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art open-source methods on PhyGenBench and VideoPhy2.

Abstract: Change detection visual question answering (CDVQA) requires answering text queries by reasoning about semantic changes in bi-temporal remote sensing images. A straightforward approach is to boost CDVQA performance with generic vision-language models via supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Despite recent progress, we observe that a significant portion of failures do not stem from clearly incorrect predictions, but from decision ambiguity, where the model assigns similar confidence to the correct answer and strong distractors. To formalize this challenge, we define Decision-Ambiguous Samples (DAS) as instances with a small probability margin between the ground-truth answer and the most competitive alternative. We argue that explicitly optimizing DAS is crucial for improving the discriminability and robustness of CDVQA models. To this end, we propose DARFT, a Decision-Ambiguity-guided Reinforcement Fine-Tuning framework that first mines DAS using an SFT-trained reference policy and then applies group-relative policy optimization on the mined subset. By leveraging multi-sample decoding and intra-group relative advantages, DARFT suppresses strong distractors and sharpens decision boundaries without additional supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent gains over SFT baselines, particularly under few-shot settings.

Abstract: Systematic failures of computer vision models on subsets with coherent visual patterns, known as error slices, pose a critical challenge for robust model evaluation. Existing slice discovery methods are primarily developed for image classification, limiting their applicability to multi-instance tasks such as detection, segmentation, and pose estimation. In real-world scenarios, error slices often arise from corner cases involving complex visual relationships, where existing instance-level approaches lacking fine-grained reasoning struggle to yield meaningful insights. Moreover, current benchmarks are typically tailored to specific algorithms or biased toward image classification, with artificial ground truth that fails to reflect real model failures. To address these limitations, we propose SliceLens, a hypothesis-driven framework that leverages LLMs and VLMs to generate and verify diverse failure hypotheses through grounded visual reasoning, enabling reliable identification of fine-grained and interpretable error slices. We further introduce FeSD (Fine-grained Slice Discovery), the first benchmark specifically designed for evaluating fine-grained error slice discovery across instance-level vision tasks, featuring expert-annotated and carefully refined ground-truth slices with precise grounding to local error regions. Extensive experiments on both existing benchmarks and FeSD demonstrate that SliceLens achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Precision@10 by 0.42 (0.73 vs. 0.31) on FeSD, and identifies interpretable slices that facilitate actionable model improvements, as validated through model repair experiments.

Abstract: The increasing frequency of natural disasters poses severe threats to human lives and leads to substantial economic losses. While 3D semantic segmentation is crucial for post-disaster assessment, existing deep learning models lack datasets specifically designed for post-disaster environments. To address this gap, we constructed a specialized 3D dataset using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-captured aerial footage of Hurricane Ian (2022) over affected areas, employing Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and Multi-View Stereo (MVS) techniques to reconstruct 3D point clouds. We evaluated the state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D semantic segmentation models, Fast Point Transformer (FPT), Point Transformer v3 (PTv3), and OA-CNNs on this dataset, exposing significant limitations in existing methods for disaster-stricken regions. These findings underscore the urgent need for advancements in 3D segmentation techniques and the development of specialized 3D benchmark datasets to improve post-disaster scene understanding and response.

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has achieved remarkable success in fine-tuning pre-trained vision transformers for various downstream tasks. Existing studies mainly focus on exploring more parameter-efficient strategies or more effective representation learning schemes. However, these methods either sacrifice fine-tuning performance or introduce excessive trainable parameters, failing to strike a balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency. To address this problem, we propose a novel tuning method named collaborative low-rank adaptation (CLoRA) in this paper. CLoRA consists of base-space sharing and sample-agnostic diversity enhancement (SADE) components. To maintain parameter efficiency while expanding the learning capacity of low-rank modules (LRMs), base-space sharing allows all LRMs to share a set of down/up-projection spaces. In CLoRA, the low-rank matrices obtained from the shared spaces collaboratively construct each LRM. Since the representations extracted by these matrices may contain redundant information, SADE is employed to regularize the similarities among them to encourage diverse representations in the training process. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used image and point cloud datasets to evaluate the performance of CLoRA. Experimental results demonstrate that CLoRA strikes a better balance between learning performance and parameter efficiency, while requiring the fewest GFLOPs for point cloud analysis, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding aims to localize the object in 3D point cloud scenes that semantically corresponds to given natural language sentences. It is very critical for roadside infrastructure system to interpret natural languages and localize relevant target objects in complex traffic environments. However, most existing datasets and approaches for 3D visual grounding focus on the indoor and outdoor driving scenes, outdoor monitoring scenarios remain unexplored due to scarcity of paired point cloud-text data captured by roadside infrastructure sensors. In this paper, we introduce a novel task of 3D Visual Grounding for Outdoor Monitoring Scenarios, which enables infrastructure-level understanding of traffic scenes beyond the ego-vehicle perspective. To support this task, we construct MoniRefer, the first real-world large-scale multi-modal dataset for roadside-level 3D visual grounding. The dataset consists of about 136,018 objects with 411,128 natural language expressions collected from multiple complex traffic intersections in the real-world environments. To ensure the quality and accuracy of the dataset, we manually verified all linguistic descriptions and 3D labels for objects. Additionally, we also propose a new end-to-end method, named Moni3DVG, which utilizes the rich appearance information provided by images and geometry and optical information from point cloud for multi-modal feature learning and 3D object localization. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the proposed benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our method. Our dataset and code will be released.

Abstract: Establishing the correct correspondence of feature points is a fundamental task in computer vision. However, the presence of numerous outliers among the feature points can significantly affect the matching results, reducing the accuracy and robustness of the process. Furthermore, a challenge arises when dealing with a large proportion of outliers: how to ensure the extraction of high-quality information while reducing errors caused by negative samples. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel method called Layer-by-Layer Hierarchical Attention Network, which enhances the precision of feature point matching in computer vision by addressing the issue of outliers. Our method incorporates stage fusion, hierarchical extraction, and an attention mechanism to improve the network's representation capability by emphasizing the rich semantic information of feature points. Specifically, we introduce a layer-by-layer channel fusion module, which preserves the feature semantic information from each stage and achieves overall fusion, thereby enhancing the representation capability of the feature points. Additionally, we design a hierarchical attention module that adaptively captures and fuses global perception and structural semantic information using an attention mechanism. Finally, we propose two architectures to extract and integrate features, thereby improving the adaptability of our network. We conduct experiments on two public datasets, namely YFCC100M and SUN3D, and the results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art techniques in both outlier removal and camera pose estimation.

Abstract: Object detection in fire rescue scenarios is importance for command and decision-making in firefighting operations. However, existing research still suffers from two main limitations. First, current work predominantly focuses on environments such as mountainous or forest areas, while paying insufficient attention to urban rescue scenes, which are more frequent and structurally complex. Second, existing detection systems include a limited number of classes, such as flames and smoke, and lack a comprehensive system covering key targets crucial for command decisions, such as fire trucks and firefighters. To address the above issues, this paper first constructs a new dataset named "FireRescue" for rescue command, which covers multiple rescue scenarios, including urban, mountainous, forest, and water areas, and contains eight key categories such as fire trucks and firefighters, with a total of 15,980 images and 32,000 bounding boxes. Secondly, to tackle the problems of inter-class confusion and missed detection of small targets caused by chaotic scenes, diverse targets, and long-distance shooting, this paper proposes an improved model named FRS-YOLO. On the one hand, the model introduces a plug-and-play multidi-mensional collaborative enhancement attention module, which enhances the discriminative representation of easily confused categories (e.g., fire trucks vs. ordinary trucks) through cross-dimensional feature interaction. On the other hand, it integrates a dynamic feature sampler to strengthen high-response foreground features, thereby mitigating the effects of smoke occlusion and background interference. Experimental results demonstrate that object detection in fire rescue scenarios is highly challenging, and the proposed method effectively improves the detection performance of YOLO series models in this context.

Conclusion: 通过结合径向并行预测和动态输出修正，RadAR为高效自回归视觉生成提供了一种创新解决方案，在提升推理速度的同时保持了模型的表征能力。

Abstract: Inspired by the remarkable success of autoregressive models in language modeling, this paradigm has been widely adopted in visual generation. However, the sequential token-by-token decoding mechanism inherent in traditional autoregressive models leads to low inference efficiency.In this paper, we propose RadAR, an efficient and parallelizable framework designed to accelerate autoregressive visual generation while preserving its representational capacity. Our approach is motivated by the observation that visual tokens exhibit strong local dependencies and spatial correlations with their neighbors--a property not fully exploited in standard raster-scan decoding orders. Specifically, we organize the generation process around a radial topology: an initial token is selected as the starting point, and all other tokens are systematically grouped into multiple concentric rings according to their spatial distances from this center. Generation then proceeds in a ring-wise manner, from inner to outer regions, enabling the parallel prediction of all tokens within the same ring. This design not only preserves the structural locality and spatial coherence of visual scenes but also substantially increases parallelization. Furthermore, to address the risk of inconsistent predictions arising from simultaneous token generation with limited context, we introduce a nested attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically refines implausible outputs during the forward pass, thereby mitigating error accumulation and preventing model collapse. By integrating radial parallel prediction with dynamic output correction, RadAR significantly improves generation efficiency.

Abstract: Reasoning Segmentation requires models to interpret complex, context-dependent linguistic queries to achieve pixel-level localization. Current dominant approaches rely heavily on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, SFT suffers from catastrophic forgetting and domain dependency, while RL is often hindered by training instability and rigid reliance on predefined reward functions. Although recent training-free methods circumvent these training burdens, they are fundamentally limited by a static inference paradigm. These methods typically rely on a single-pass "generate-then-segment" chain, which suffers from insufficient reasoning depth and lacks the capability to self-correct linguistic hallucinations or spatial misinterpretations. In this paper, we challenge these limitations and propose EVOL-SAM3, a novel zero-shot framework that reformulates reasoning segmentation as an inference-time evolutionary search process. Instead of relying on a fixed prompt, EVOL-SAM3 maintains a population of prompt hypotheses and iteratively refines them through a "Generate-Evaluate-Evolve" loop. We introduce a Visual Arena to assess prompt fitness via reference-free pairwise tournaments, and a Semantic Mutation operator to inject diversity and correct semantic errors. Furthermore, a Heterogeneous Arena module integrates geometric priors with semantic reasoning to ensure robust final selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EVOL-SAM3 not only substantially outperforms static baselines but also significantly surpasses fully supervised state-of-the-art methods on the challenging ReasonSeg benchmark in a zero-shot setting.

TL;DR: 提出EchoFoley新任务，解决当前视频-文本-音频生成存在的视觉主导、可控性定义缺失、指令理解弱等问题，引入用于视频音效生成的符号化声音事件表示，并构建专家标注的大规模基准数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频-文本-音频（VT2A）技术存在三个关键限制：1）视觉和文本条件不平衡导致视觉主导；2）缺少细粒度可控生成的具体定义；3）指令理解和跟随能力弱（现有数据集依赖简短分类标签）。

Method: 提出EchoFoley新任务，建立用于视频音效生成的符号化声音事件表示方法，指定声音何时、何种、如何产生，支持生成、插入和编辑等细粒度控制。构建EchoFoley-6k数据集（6000+专家标注的视频-指令-标注三元组）。基于此提出EchoVidia框架，采用声音事件中心的智能生成架构和慢快速思考策略。

Result: 实验表明，EchoVidia在可控性上超越当前VT2A模型40.7%，在感知质量上提升12.5%。

Conclusion: EchoFoley任务及其框架成功解决了VT2A模型的关键限制，实现了细粒度可控的视频音效生成，并通过专家标注数据集和智能生成框架显著提升了音效生成的性能。

Abstract: Sound effects build an essential layer of multimodal storytelling, shaping the emotional atmosphere and the narrative semantics of videos. Despite recent advancement in video-text-to-audio (VT2A), the current formulation faces three key limitations: First, an imbalance between visual and textual conditioning that leads to visual dominance; Second, the absence of a concrete definition for fine-grained controllable generation; Third, weak instruction understanding and following, as existing datasets rely on brief categorical tags. To address these limitations, we introduce EchoFoley, a new task designed for video-grounded sound generation with both event level local control and hierarchical semantic control. Our symbolic representation for sounding events specifies when, what, and how each sound is produced within a video or instruction, enabling fine-grained controls like sound generation, insertion, and editing. To support this task, we construct EchoFoley-6k, a large-scale, expert-curated benchmark containing over 6,000 video-instruction-annotation triplets. Building upon this foundation, we propose EchoVidia a sounding-event-centric agentic generation framework with slow-fast thinking strategy. Experiments show that EchoVidia surpasses recent VT2A models by 40.7% in controllability and 12.5% in perceptual quality.

Abstract: The recent advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has marked a significant breakthrough in real-time novel view synthesis. However, the rapid proliferation of 3DGS-based algorithms has created a pressing need for standardized and comprehensive evaluation tools, especially for compression task. Existing benchmarks often lack the specific metrics necessary to holistically assess the unique characteristics of different methods, such as rendering speed, rate distortion trade-offs memory efficiency, and geometric accuracy. To address this gap, we introduce Splatwizard, a unified benchmark toolkit designed specifically for benchmarking 3DGS compression models. Splatwizard provides an easy-to-use framework to implement new 3DGS compression model and utilize state-of-the-art techniques proposed by previous work. Besides, an integrated pipeline that automates the calculation of key performance indicators, including image-based quality metrics, chamfer distance of reconstruct mesh, rendering frame rates, and computational resource consumption is included in the framework as well.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have advanced novel-view synthesis. Recent methods extend multi-view 2D segmentation to 3D, enabling instance/semantic segmentation for better scene understanding. A key challenge is the inconsistency of 2D instance labels across views, leading to poor 3D predictions. Existing methods use a two-stage approach in which some rely on contrastive learning with hyperparameter-sensitive clustering, while others preprocess labels for consistency. We propose a unified framework that merges these steps, reducing training time and improving performance by introducing a learnable feature embedding for segmentation in Gaussian primitives. This embedding is then efficiently decoded into instance labels through a novel "Embedding-to-Label" process, effectively integrating the optimization. While this unified framework offers substantial benefits, we observed artifacts at the object boundaries. To address the object boundary issues, we propose hard-mining samples along these boundaries. However, directly applying hard mining to the feature embeddings proved unstable. Therefore, we apply a linear layer to the rasterized feature embeddings before calculating the triplet loss, which stabilizes training and significantly improves performance. Our method outperforms baselines qualitatively and quantitatively on the ScanNet, Replica3D, and Messy-Rooms datasets.

Conclusion: 所提出的管道能够在无需预训练或微调的情况下，提高跨模态系统在多物体3D场景中的任务表现，为解决2D到3D的维度转换问题提供了一种有效的在线自适应解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-modal systems trained on 2D visual inputs are presented with a dimensional shift when processing 3D scenes. An in-scene camera bridges the dimensionality gap but requires learning a control module. We introduce a new method that improves multivariate mutual information estimates by regret minimisation with derivative-free optimisation. Our algorithm enables off-the-shelf cross-modal systems trained on 2D visual inputs to adapt online to object occlusions and differentiate features. The pairing of expressive measures and value-based optimisation assists control of an in-scene camera to learn directly from the noisy outputs of vision-language models. The resulting pipeline improves performance in cross-modal tasks on multi-object 3D scenes without resorting to pretraining or finetuning.

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that cause misclassification when specific perturbations are added to input images. This vulnerability also threatens the reliability of DNN-based monocular depth estimation (MDE) models, making robustness enhancement a critical need in practical applications. To validate the vulnerability of DNN-based MDE models, this study proposes a projection-based adversarial attack method that projects perturbation light onto a target object. The proposed method employs physics-in-the-loop (PITL) optimization -- evaluating candidate solutions in actual environments to account for device specifications and disturbances -- and utilizes a distributed covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy. Experiments confirmed that the proposed method successfully created adversarial examples that lead to depth misestimations, resulting in parts of objects disappearing from the target scene.

Abstract: Existing open-source film restoration methods show limited performance compared to commercial methods due to training with low-quality synthetic data and employing noisy optical flows. In addition, high-resolution films have not been explored by the open-source methods.We propose HaineiFRDM(Film Restoration Diffusion Model), a film restoration framework, to explore diffusion model's powerful content-understanding ability to help human expert better restore indistinguishable film defects.Specifically, we employ a patch-wise training and testing strategy to make restoring high-resolution films on one 24GB-VRAMR GPU possible and design a position-aware Global Prompt and Frame Fusion Modules.Also, we introduce a global-local frequency module to reconstruct consistent textures among different patches. Besides, we firstly restore a low-resolution result and use it as global residual to mitigate blocky artifacts caused by patching process.Furthermore, we construct a film restoration dataset that contains restored real-degraded films and realistic synthetic data.Comprehensive experimental results conclusively demonstrate the superiority of our model in defect restoration ability over existing open-source methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Noise2Noise方法虽然可以使用含噪图像对进行训练而无需干净目标图像，但当对含噪目标应用非线性函数时会产生偏差，这限制了预处理的选择范围。特别是在高动态范围(HDR)图像去噪中，非线性色调映射被认为是必要的但传统认为与Noise2Noise不兼容。

Method: 开发了一个理论框架来分析非线性函数对Noise2Noise训练的影响，识别出一类产生最小偏差的非线性函数。将此方法应用于蒙特卡洛渲染产生的HDR图像去噪，研究了特定损失函数和色调映射函数的组合来减少异常值影响。

Result: 在现有基于机器学习的蒙特卡洛去噪器上应用该方法，仅使用含噪训练数据就能获得接近原始实现(使用高采样参考图像)的结果，成功解决了HDR图像训练中的异常值问题。

Conclusion: 研究表明某些非线性函数可以与Noise2Noise训练兼容，为处理HDR图像等需要非线性预处理的去噪任务提供了理论基础和实用方法，扩展了Noise2Noise的应用范围。

Abstract: The Noise2Noise method allows for training machine learning-based denoisers with pairs of input and target images where both the input and target can be noisy. This removes the need for training with clean target images, which can be difficult to obtain. However, Noise2Noise training has a major limitation: nonlinear functions applied to the noisy targets will skew the results. This bias occurs because the nonlinearity makes the expected value of the noisy targets different from the clean target image. Since nonlinear functions are common in image processing, avoiding them limits the types of preprocessing that can be performed on the noisy targets. Our main insight is that certain nonlinear functions can be applied to the noisy targets without adding significant bias to the results. We develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the effects of these nonlinearities, and describe a class of nonlinear functions with minimal bias.
  We demonstrate our method on the denoising of high dynamic range (HDR) images produced by Monte Carlo rendering. Noise2Noise training can have trouble with HDR images, where the training process is overwhelmed by outliers and performs poorly. We consider a commonly used method of addressing these training issues: applying a nonlinear tone mapping function to the model output and target images to reduce their dynamic range. This method was previously thought to be incompatible with Noise2Noise training because of the nonlinearities involved. We show that certain combinations of loss functions and tone mapping functions can reduce the effect of outliers while introducing minimal bias. We apply our method to an existing machine learning-based Monte Carlo denoiser, where the original implementation was trained with high-sample count reference images. Our results approach those of the original implementation, but are produced using only noisy training data.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业环境中多目标跟踪存在特殊挑战：重复模式、相似外观、光照突变和频繁遮挡。现有依赖运动信息的跟踪器在目标频繁遮挡时难以保持身份，而外观相似性使得外观关联难以直接应用，需要新的解决方案。

Method: CropTrack采用外观与运动信息结合的方法：1）重排序增强的外观关联；2）一对多关联与基于外观的冲突解决策略；3）指数移动平均原型特征库来改进外观特征表示和关联。

Result: 在公开农业多目标跟踪数据集上，CropTrack表现出稳定的身份保持能力，超越传统运动跟踪方法。与最先进方法相比，在识别F1分数和关联准确率方面获得显著提升，同时身份切换次数更低。

Conclusion: CropTrack通过有效结合外观与运动信息，解决了农业环境中多目标跟踪的特殊挑战，提高了身份保持能力，为农业场景的目标跟踪提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Multiple-object tracking (MOT) in agricultural environments presents major challenges due to repetitive patterns, similar object appearances, sudden illumination changes, and frequent occlusions. Contemporary trackers in this domain rely on the motion of objects rather than appearance for association. Nevertheless, they struggle to maintain object identities when targets undergo frequent and strong occlusions. The high similarity of object appearances makes integrating appearance-based association nontrivial for agricultural scenarios. To solve this problem we propose CropTrack, a novel MOT framework based on the combination of appearance and motion information. CropTrack integrates a reranking-enhanced appearance association, a one-to-many association with appearance-based conflict resolution strategy, and an exponential moving average prototype feature bank to improve appearance-based association. Evaluated on publicly available agricultural MOT datasets, CropTrack demonstrates consistent identity preservation, outperforming traditional motion-based tracking methods. Compared to the state of the art, CropTrack achieves significant gains in identification F1 and association accuracy scores with a lower number of identity switches.

Abstract: Building intelligent agents capable of dexterous manipulation is essential for achieving human-like automation in both robotics and digital environments. However, existing GUI agents rely on discrete click predictions (x,y), which prohibits free-form, closed-loop trajectories (e.g. dragging a progress bar) that require continuous, on-the-fly perception and adjustment. In this work, we develop ShowUI-$π$, the first flow-based generative model as GUI dexterous hand, featuring the following designs: (i) Unified Discrete-Continuous Actions, integrating discrete clicks and continuous drags within a shared model, enabling flexible adaptation across diverse interaction modes; (ii) Flow-based Action Generation for drag modeling, which predicts incremental cursor adjustments from continuous visual observations via a lightweight action expert, ensuring smooth and stable trajectories; (iii) Drag Training data and Benchmark, where we manually collect and synthesize 20K drag trajectories across five domains (e.g. PowerPoint, Adobe Premiere Pro), and introduce ScreenDrag, a benchmark with comprehensive online and offline evaluation protocols for assessing GUI agents' drag capabilities. Our experiments show that proprietary GUI agents still struggle on ScreenDrag (e.g. Operator scores 13.27, and the best Gemini-2.5-CUA reaches 22.18). In contrast, ShowUI-$π$ achieves 26.98 with only 450M parameters, underscoring both the difficulty of the task and the effectiveness of our approach. We hope this work advances GUI agents toward human-like dexterous control in digital world. The code is available at https://github.com/showlab/showui-pi.

Conclusion: 该研究为系统评估通用多模态大语言模型在具身导航环境中的能力奠定基础，揭示了其在顺序决策方面的局限性，为多模态大语言模型的具身智能体后训练提供重要指导

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, their performance as embodied agents, which requires multi-round dialogue spatial reasoning and sequential action prediction, needs further exploration. Our work investigates this potential in the context of Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) by introducing a unified and extensible evaluation framework to probe MLLMs as zero-shot agents by bridging traditional navigation datasets into a standardized benchmark, named VLN-MME. We simplify the evaluation with a highly modular and accessible design. This flexibility streamlines experiments, enabling structured comparisons and component-level ablations across diverse MLLM architectures, agent designs, and navigation tasks. Crucially, enabled by our framework, we observe that enhancing our baseline agent with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and self-reflection leads to an unexpected performance decrease. This suggests MLLMs exhibit poor context awareness in embodied navigation tasks; although they can follow instructions and structure their output, their 3D spatial reasoning fidelity is low. VLN-MME lays the groundwork for systematic evaluation of general-purpose MLLMs in embodied navigation settings and reveals limitations in their sequential decision-making capabilities. We believe these findings offer crucial guidance for MLLM post-training as embodied agents.

Abstract: Compressed deep learning models are crucial for deploying computer vision systems on resource-constrained devices. However, model compression may affect robustness, especially under natural corruption. Therefore, it is important to consider robustness evaluation while validating computer vision systems. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of compression techniques - quantization, pruning, and weight clustering applied individually and in combination to convolutional neural networks (ResNet-50, VGG-19, and MobileNetV2). Using the CIFAR-10-C and CIFAR 100-C datasets, we analyze the trade-offs between robustness, accuracy, and compression ratio. Our results show that certain compression strategies not only preserve but can also improve robustness, particularly on networks with more complex architectures. Utilizing multiobjective assessment, we determine the best configurations, showing that customized technique combinations produce beneficial multi-objective results. This study provides insights into selecting compression methods for robust and efficient deployment of models in corrupted real-world environments.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly adopted as central reasoning modules for embodied agents. Existing benchmarks evaluate their capabilities under ideal, well-lit conditions, yet robust 24/7 operation demands performance under a wide range of visual degradations, including low-light conditions at night or in dark environments--a core necessity that has been largely overlooked. To address this underexplored challenge, we present DarkEQA, an open-source benchmark for evaluating EQA-relevant perceptual primitives under multi-level low-light conditions. DarkEQA isolates the perception bottleneck by evaluating question answering from egocentric observations under controlled degradations, enabling attributable robustness analysis. A key design feature of DarkEQA is its physical fidelity: visual degradations are modeled in linear RAW space, simulating physics-based illumination drop and sensor noise followed by an ISP-inspired rendering pipeline. We demonstrate the utility of DarkEQA by evaluating a wide range of state-of-the-art VLMs and Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) models. Our analysis systematically reveals VLMs' limitations when operating under these challenging visual conditions. Our code and benchmark dataset will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: We introduce FinMMDocR, a novel bilingual multimodal benchmark for evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on real-world financial numerical reasoning. Compared to existing benchmarks, our work delivers three major advancements. (1) Scenario Awareness: 57.9% of 1,200 expert-annotated problems incorporate 12 types of implicit financial scenarios (e.g., Portfolio Management), challenging models to perform expert-level reasoning based on assumptions; (2) Document Understanding: 837 Chinese/English documents spanning 9 types (e.g., Company Research) average 50.8 pages with rich visual elements, significantly surpassing existing benchmarks in both breadth and depth of financial documents; (3) Multi-Step Computation: Problems demand 11-step reasoning on average (5.3 extraction + 5.7 calculation steps), with 65.0% requiring cross-page evidence (2.4 pages average). The best-performing MLLM achieves only 58.0% accuracy, and different retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods show significant performance variations on this task. We expect FinMMDocR to drive improvements in MLLMs and reasoning-enhanced methods on complex multimodal reasoning tasks in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: 3D object detectors are fundamental components of perception systems in autonomous vehicles. While these detectors achieve remarkable performance on standard autonomous driving benchmarks, they often struggle to generalize across different domains - for instance, a model trained in the U.S. may perform poorly in regions like Asia or Europe. This paper presents a novel lidar domain adaptation method based on neuron activation patterns, demonstrating that state-of-the-art performance can be achieved by annotating only a small, representative, and diverse subset of samples from the target domain if they are correctly selected. The proposed approach requires very small annotation budget and, when combined with post-training techniques inspired by continual learning prevent weight drift from the original model. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed domain adaptation approach outperforms both linear probing and state-of-the-art domain adaptation techniques.

TL;DR: SpaceTimePilot is a video diffusion model that enables independent control over camera viewpoints and motion sequences.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: The paper aims to develop a video generation model that can disentangle spatial (camera view) and temporal (motion sequence) controls

Method: The model introduces animation time-embedding and temporal-warping training, plus CamxTime dataset for precise space-time control

Result: The model successfully achieves space-time disentanglement and shows strong performance on both real-world and synthetic data

Conclusion: SpaceTimePilot provides an effective framework for controllable video generation with independent space and time manipulation

Abstract: We present SpaceTimePilot, a video diffusion model that disentangles space and time for controllable generative rendering. Given a monocular video, SpaceTimePilot can independently alter the camera viewpoint and the motion sequence within the generative process, re-rendering the scene for continuous and arbitrary exploration across space and time. To achieve this, we introduce an effective animation time-embedding mechanism in the diffusion process, allowing explicit control of the output video's motion sequence with respect to that of the source video. As no datasets provide paired videos of the same dynamic scene with continuous temporal variations, we propose a simple yet effective temporal-warping training scheme that repurposes existing multi-view datasets to mimic temporal differences. This strategy effectively supervises the model to learn temporal control and achieve robust space-time disentanglement. To further enhance the precision of dual control, we introduce two additional components: an improved camera-conditioning mechanism that allows altering the camera from the first frame, and CamxTime, the first synthetic space-and-time full-coverage rendering dataset that provides fully free space-time video trajectories within a scene. Joint training on the temporal-warping scheme and the CamxTime dataset yields more precise temporal control. We evaluate SpaceTimePilot on both real-world and synthetic data, demonstrating clear space-time disentanglement and strong results compared to prior work.

Abstract: Accurate and interpretable crop disease diagnosis is essential for agricultural decision-making, yet existing methods often rely on costly supervised fine-tuning and perform poorly under domain shifts. We propose Caption--Prompt--Judge (CPJ), a training-free few-shot framework that enhances Agri-Pest VQA through structured, interpretable image captions. CPJ employs large vision-language models to generate multi-angle captions, refined iteratively via an LLM-as-Judge module, which then inform a dual-answer VQA process for both recognition and management responses. Evaluated on CDDMBench, CPJ significantly improves performance: using GPT-5-mini captions, GPT-5-Nano achieves \textbf{+22.7} pp in disease classification and \textbf{+19.5} points in QA score over no-caption baselines. The framework provides transparent, evidence-based reasoning, advancing robust and explainable agricultural diagnosis without fine-tuning.

TL;DR: 本文提出了ProDM模型，通过生成式扩散框架从不进行心电图门控的胸部CT中恢复无运动的钙化病灶，以改善冠状动脉钙化评分准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冠状动脉钙化评分是评估心血管疾病风险的重要工具，但常受心脏和呼吸运动产生的伪影影响。心电图门控心脏CT可减少伪影，但应用受限。从常规胸部CT中偶然发现冠状动脉钙化具有广泛可及性，但该方式受更严重运动伪影限制。

Method: 提出ProDM（Property-aware Progressive Correction Diffusion Model）生成式扩散框架，包含三个关键组件：1）冠状动脉钙化运动仿真数据引擎，从心脏门控CT直接合成具有多样化运动轨迹的非门控采集数据；2）通过可微分钙化一致性损失的属性感知学习策略；3）渐进校正方案，逐步消除伪影。

Result: 在真实患者数据集上的实验表明，与多个基线方法相比，ProDM显著提高了冠状动脉钙化评分准确性、空间病灶保真度和风险分层性能。对真实非门控扫描的读者研究证实ProDM能抑制运动伪影并提高临床可用性。

Conclusion: 这些发现突显了渐进式、属性感知框架在从常规胸部CT成像中进行可靠冠状动脉钙化量化的潜力。

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring from chest CT is a well-established tool to stratify and refine clinical cardiovascular disease risk estimation. CAC quantification relies on the accurate delineation of calcified lesions, but is oftentimes affected by artifacts introduced by cardiac and respiratory motion. ECG-gated cardiac CTs substantially reduce motion artifacts, but their use in population screening and routine imaging remains limited due to gating requirements and lack of insurance coverage. Although identification of incidental CAC from non-gated chest CT is increasingly considered for it offers an accessible and widely available alternative, this modality is limited by more severe motion artifacts. We present ProDM (Property-aware Progressive Correction Diffusion Model), a generative diffusion framework that restores motion-free calcified lesions from non-gated CTs. ProDM introduces three key components: (1) a CAC motion simulation data engine that synthesizes realistic non-gated acquisitions with diverse motion trajectories directly from cardiac-gated CTs, enabling supervised training without paired data; (2) a property-aware learning strategy incorporating calcium-specific priors through a differentiable calcium consistency loss to preserve lesion integrity; and (3) a progressive correction scheme that reduces artifacts gradually across diffusion steps to enhance stability and calcium fidelity. Experiments on real patient datasets show that ProDM significantly improves CAC scoring accuracy, spatial lesion fidelity, and risk stratification performance compared with several baselines. A reader study on real non-gated scans further confirms that ProDM suppresses motion artifacts and improves clinical usability. These findings highlight the potential of progressive, property-aware frameworks for reliable CAC quantification from routine chest CT imaging.

Motivation: 视频生成最近展现出链式推理能力，但现有评估框架依赖单帧评判，容易出现过程错误但结果正确的“结果作弊”现象，缺乏对推理过程有效性的评估标准。

Method: 提出了VIPER基准，包含16个跨域任务；设计了Process-outcome Consistency (POC@r)指标，使用VLM-as-Judge评估中间步骤有效性和最终结果一致性。

Result: 实验发现：当前最先进视频模型POC@1.0仅约20%；存在明显的结果作弊现象；测试时间尺度和采样鲁棒性影响显著，显示视频生成与泛化视觉推理存在较大差距。

Conclusion: VIPER基准有助于评估生成式视频推理的过程有效性，揭示了当前模型的局限性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video generation have demonstrated an emerging capability termed Chain-of-Frames (CoF) reasoning, where models resolve complex tasks through the generation of continuous frames. While these models show promise for Generative Video Reasoning (GVR), existing evaluation frameworks often rely on single-frame assessments, which can lead to outcome-hacking, where a model reaches a correct conclusion through an erroneous process. To address this, we propose a process-aware evaluation paradigm. We introduce VIPER, a comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 tasks across temporal, structural, symbolic, spatial, physics, and planning reasoning. Furthermore, we propose Process-outcome Consistency (POC@r), a new metric that utilizes VLM-as-Judge with a hierarchical rubric to evaluate both the validity of the intermediate steps and the final result. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art video models achieve only about 20% POC@1.0 and exhibit a significant outcome-hacking. We further explore the impact of test-time scaling and sampling robustness, highlighting a substantial gap between current video generation and true generalized visual reasoning. Our benchmark will be publicly released.

Abstract: Lifelong person Re-IDentification (L-ReID) exploits sequentially collected data to continuously train and update a ReID model, focusing on the overall performance of all data. Its main challenge is to avoid the catastrophic forgetting problem of old knowledge while training on new data. Existing L-ReID methods typically re-extract new features for all historical gallery images for inference after each update, known as "re-indexing". However, historical gallery data typically suffers from direct saving due to the data privacy issue and the high re-indexing costs for large-scale gallery images. As a result, it inevitably leads to incompatible retrieval between query features extracted by the updated model and gallery features extracted by those before the update, greatly impairing the re-identification performance. To tackle the above issue, this paper focuses on a new task called Re-index Free Lifelong person Re-IDentification (RFL-ReID), which requires performing lifelong person re-identification without re-indexing historical gallery images. Therefore, RFL-ReID is more challenging than L-ReID, requiring continuous learning and balancing new and old knowledge in diverse streaming data, and making the features output by the new and old models compatible with each other. To this end, we propose a Bidirectional Continuous Compatible Representation (Bi-C2R) framework to continuously update the gallery features extracted by the old model to perform efficient L-ReID in a compatible manner. We verify our proposed Bi-C2R method through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, which demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve leading performance on both the introduced RFL-ReID task and the traditional L-ReID task.

Conclusion: 通过重新定义视觉配音任务并利用完整视觉上下文，提出的自举框架在唇语同步、身份保持和视觉保真度方面显著优于现有方法，并解决了传统方法的根本性训练数据问题。

Abstract: Audio-driven visual dubbing aims to synchronize a video's lip movements with new speech, but is fundamentally challenged by the lack of ideal training data: paired videos where only a subject's lip movements differ while all other visual conditions are identical. Existing methods circumvent this with a mask-based inpainting paradigm, where an incomplete visual conditioning forces models to simultaneously hallucinate missing content and sync lips, leading to visual artifacts, identity drift, and poor synchronization. In this work, we propose a novel self-bootstrapping framework that reframes visual dubbing from an ill-posed inpainting task into a well-conditioned video-to-video editing problem. Our approach employs a Diffusion Transformer, first as a data generator, to synthesize ideal training data: a lip-altered companion video for each real sample, forming visually aligned video pairs. A DiT-based audio-driven editor is then trained on these pairs end-to-end, leveraging the complete and aligned input video frames to focus solely on precise, audio-driven lip modifications. This complete, frame-aligned input conditioning forms a rich visual context for the editor, providing it with complete identity cues, scene interactions, and continuous spatiotemporal dynamics. Leveraging this rich context fundamentally enables our method to achieve highly accurate lip sync, faithful identity preservation, and exceptional robustness against challenging in-the-wild scenarios. We further introduce a timestep-adaptive multi-phase learning strategy as a necessary component to disentangle conflicting editing objectives across diffusion timesteps, thereby facilitating stable training and yielding enhanced lip synchronization and visual fidelity. Additionally, we propose ContextDubBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset for robust evaluation in diverse and challenging practical application scenarios.

Abstract: Recognizing fine-grained actions from temporally corrupted skeleton sequences remains a significant challenge, particularly in real-world scenarios where online pose estimation often yields substantial missing data. Existing methods often struggle to accurately recover temporal dynamics and fine-grained spatial structures, resulting in the loss of subtle motion cues crucial for distinguishing similar actions. To address this, we propose FineTec, a unified framework for Fine-grained action recognition under Temporal Corruption. FineTec first restores a base skeleton sequence from corrupted input using context-aware completion with diverse temporal masking. Next, a skeleton-based spatial decomposition module partitions the skeleton into five semantic regions, further divides them into dynamic and static subgroups based on motion variance, and generates two augmented skeleton sequences via targeted perturbation. These, along with the base sequence, are then processed by a physics-driven estimation module, which utilizes Lagrangian dynamics to estimate joint accelerations. Finally, both the fused skeleton position sequence and the fused acceleration sequence are jointly fed into a GCN-based action recognition head. Extensive experiments on both coarse-grained (NTU-60, NTU-120) and fine-grained (Gym99, Gym288) benchmarks show that FineTec significantly outperforms previous methods under various levels of temporal corruption. Specifically, FineTec achieves top-1 accuracies of 89.1% and 78.1% on the challenging Gym99-severe and Gym288-severe settings, respectively, demonstrating its robustness and generalizability. Code and datasets could be found at https://smartdianlab.github.io/projects-FineTec/.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D reconstruction have achieved remarkable progress in high-quality scene capture from dense multi-view imagery, yet struggle when input views are limited. Various approaches, including regularization techniques, semantic priors, and geometric constraints, have been implemented to address this challenge. Latest diffusion-based methods have demonstrated substantial improvements by generating novel views from new camera poses to augment training data, surpassing earlier regularization and prior-based techniques. Despite this progress, we identify three critical limitations in these state-of-the-art approaches: inadequate coverage beyond known view peripheries, geometric inconsistencies across generated views, and computationally expensive pipelines. We introduce GaMO (Geometry-aware Multi-view Outpainter), a framework that reformulates sparse-view reconstruction through multi-view outpainting. Instead of generating new viewpoints, GaMO expands the field of view from existing camera poses, which inherently preserves geometric consistency while providing broader scene coverage. Our approach employs multi-view conditioning and geometry-aware denoising strategies in a zero-shot manner without training. Extensive experiments on Replica and ScanNet++ demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across 3, 6, and 9 input views, outperforming prior methods in PSNR and LPIPS, while achieving a $25\times$ speedup over SOTA diffusion-based methods with processing time under 10 minutes.

Abstract: We introduce the first example of algebraically constructed hierarchical quasi-cyclic codes. These codes are built from Reed-Solomon codes using a 1964 construction of superimposed codes by Kautz and Singleton. We show both the number of levels in the hierarchy and the index of these Reed-Solomon derived codes are determined by the field size. We show that this property also holds for certain additional classes of polynomial evaluation codes.
  We provide explicit code parameters and properties as well as some additional bounds on parameters such as rank and distance. In particular, starting with Reed-Solomon codes of dimension $k=2$ yields hierarchical quasi-cyclic codes with Tanner graphs of girth 6.
  We present a table of small code parameters and note that some of these codes meet the best known minimum distance for binary codes, with the additional hierarchical quasi-cyclic structure. We draw connections to similar constructions in the literature, but importantly, while existing literature on related codes is largely simulation-based, we present a novel algebraic approach to determining new bounds on parameters of these codes.

Abstract: This paper proposes a Chebyshev polynomial expansion framework for the recovery of a continuous angular power spectrum (APS) from channel covariance. By exploiting the orthogonality of Chebyshev polynomials in a transformed domain, we derive an exact series representation of the covariance and reformulate the inherently ill-posed APS inversion as a finite-dimensional linear regression problem via truncation. The associated approximation error is directly controlled by the tail of the APS's Chebyshev series and decays rapidly with increasing angular smoothness. Building on this representation, we derive an exact semidefinite characterization of nonnegative APS and introduce a derivative-based regularizer that promotes smoothly varying APS profiles while preserving transitions of clusters. Simulation results show that the proposed Chebyshev-based framework yields accurate APS reconstruction, and enables reliable downlink (DL) covariance prediction from uplink (UL) measurements in a frequency division duplex (FDD) setting. These findings indicate that jointly exploiting smoothness and nonnegativity in a Chebyshev domain provides an effective tool for covariance-domain processing in multi-antenna systems.

Abstract: As wireless communication applications evolve from traditional multipath environments to high-mobility scenarios like unmanned aerial vehicles, multiplexing techniques have advanced accordingly. Traditional single-carrier frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE) and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) have given way to emerging orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) and affine frequency-division multiplexing (AFDM). These approaches exploit specific channel structures to diagonalize or sparsify the effective channel, thereby enabling low-complexity detection. However, their reliance on these structures significantly limits their robustness in dynamic, real-world environments. To address these challenges, this paper studies a random multiplexing technique that is decoupled from the physical channels, enabling its application to arbitrary norm-bounded and spectrally convergent channel matrices. Random multiplexing achieves statistical fading-channel ergodicity for transmitted signals by constructing an equivalent input-isotropic channel matrix in the random transform domain. It guarantees the asymptotic replica MAP bit-error rate (BER) optimality of AMP-type detectors for linear systems with arbitrary norm-bounded, spectrally convergent channel matrices and signaling configurations, under the unique fixed point assumption. A low-complexity cross-domain memory AMP (CD-MAMP) detector is considered, leveraging the sparsity of the time-domain channel and the randomness of the equivalent channel. Optimal power allocations are derived to minimize the replica MAP BER and maximize the replica constrained capacity of random multiplexing systems. The optimal coding principle and replica constrained-capacity optimality of CD-MAMP detector are investigated for random multiplexing systems. Additionally, the versatility of random multiplexing in diverse wireless applications is explored.

Abstract: The explosive growth of artificial intelligence (AI) workloads in modern data centers demands a radical transformation of interconnect architectures. Traditional copper and optical wiring face fundamental challenges in latency, power consumption, and rigidity, constraining the scalability of distributed AI clusters. This article introduces a vision for Terahertz (THz) Wireless Data Center (THz-WDC) that combines ultra-broadband capacity, one-hop low-latency communication, and energy efficiency in the short-to-medium range (1-100m). Performance and technical requirements are first articulated, including up to 1 Tbps per link, aggregate throughput up to 10 Tbps via spatial multiplexing, sub-50 ns single-hop latency, and sub-10 pJ/bit energy efficiency over 20m. To achieve these ambitious goals, key enabling technologies are explored, including digital-twin-based orchestration, low-complexity beam manipulation technologies, all-silicon THz transceivers, and low-complexity analog baseband architectures. Moreover, as future data centers shift toward quantum and chiplet-based modular architectures, THz wireless links provide a flexible mechanism for interconnecting, testing, and reconfiguring these modules. Finally, numerical analysis is presented on the latency and power regimes of THz versus optical and copper interconnects, identifying the specific distance and throughput domains where THz links can surpass conventional wired solutions.

*Runtian Zhu,Lingfei Jin*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文提出了TGRS码和Roth-Lempel码的列表和唯一解码算法，基于Guruswami-Sudan算法，在特定参数条件下实现了接近线性的时间复杂度，显著改进了先前二次时间的算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大多MDS码是GRS码，而非GRS码的研究相对较少。研究非GRS码具有理论意义，且在密码学应用中很有价值，因为GRS码的强代数结构在某些场景下可能不受欢迎。TGRS码和Roth-Lempel码是两种代表性的非GRS码，但现有的解码研究较少，许多问题尚未解决。

Method: 基于Guruswami-Sudan算法，提出了TGRS码和Roth-Lempel码的列表解码和唯一解码算法。对于TGRS码，算法支持固定速率且包含O(n^2)个扭曲的码，大幅扩展了先前仅支持单扭曲的工作。对于Roth-Lempel码，首次提供了高效解码器。此外，还将代数操作检测码集成到列表解码框架中。

Result: 在合适的参数条件下，提出的算法实现了接近线性的运行时间，改善了先前最佳的二次时间复杂度。列表解码器在许多参数范围内超越了经典的唯一解码半径。通过集成AMD码，能够以高概率从输出列表中恢复正确的消息。

Conclusion: 本研究为两种重要的非GRS码提供了高效的解码算法，突破了现有解码器的限制，为这些码的实际应用奠定了基础。特别是对于TGRS码，大幅扩展了可处理的扭曲数量；对于Roth-Lempel码，提供了首个高效解码器。

Abstract: MDS codes play a central role in practice due to their broad applications. To date, most known MDS codes are generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes, leaving codes that are not equivalent to GRS codes comparatively less understood. Studying this non-GRS regime is therefore of intrinsic theoretical interest, and is also practically relevant since the strong algebraic structure of GRS codes can be undesirable in cryptographic settings. Among the known non-GRS codes, twisted generalized Reed-Solomon (TGRS) codes and Roth-Lempel codes are two representative families of non-GRS codes that have attracted significant attention. Though substantial work has been devoted to the construction and structural analysis of TGRS and Roth-Lempel codes, comparatively little attention has been paid to their decoding, and many problems remain open. In this paper, we propose list and unique decoding algorithms for TGRS codes and Roth-Lempel codes based on the Guruswami-Sudan algorithm. Under suitable parameter conditions, our algorithms achieve near-linear running time in the code length, improving upon the previously best-known quadratic-time complexity. Our TGRS decoder supports fixed-rate TGRS codes with up to O(n^2) twists, substantially extending prior work that only handled the single-twist case. For Roth-Lempel codes, we provide what appears to be the first efficient decoder. Moreover, our list decoders surpass the classical unique-decoding radius for a broad range of parameters. Finally, we incorporate algebraic manipulation detection (AMD) codes into the list-decoding framework, enabling recovery of the correct message from the output list with high probability.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文研究了有限域上的随机空间耦合低密度奇偶校验码，比较了不同耦合结构在距离性能和迭代译码阈值方面的表现，通过对称性分析建立了通用的阈值饱和理论框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究空间耦合LDPC码在有限域上的性能，特别关注不同耦合结构对最小距离和停止集大小的影响，以及如何建立适用于任意有限域和对称信道的统一迭代译码阈值分析框架。

Method: 定义两类耦合结构：标准耦合和改进耦合，使用独立均匀随机单项式映射构建Tanner图。引入q元输入无记忆对称信道，建立对称概率测度及其参考测度的数学框架，分析其退化理论和度量拓扑性质，最终推导阈值饱和结果。

Result: 证明两类耦合结构均具有渐进良好的最小距离和最小停止集大小，改进耦合在距离性能上优于标准耦合。建立了两类耦合结构在q元有限域和QMSC信道上的通用阈值饱和结果：随着耦合参数增大，置信传播阈值趋近于仅依赖于基础结构和信道族的确定阈值。

Conclusion: 提出的分析框架能够统一处理有限域上空间耦合LDPC码的距离和阈值特性，改进耦合结构在保持良好距离性能的同时具备优化的阈值行为，为多元LDPC码的设计提供了理论指导。

Abstract: We investigate random spatially coupled low-density parity-check (SC-LDPC) code ensembles over finite fields. Under different variable-node edge-spreading rules, the random Tanner graphs of several coupled ensembles are defined by multiple independent, uniformly random monomial maps. The two main coupled ensembles considered are referred to as the standard coupled ensemble and the improved coupled ensemble. We prove that both coupled ensembles exhibit asymptotically good minimum distance and minimum stopping set size. Theoretical and numerical results show that the improved coupled ensemble can achieve better distance performance than the standard coupled ensemble. We introduce the essential preliminaries and analytical tools needed to analyze the iterative decoding threshold of coupled ensembles over any finite field. We consider a class of memoryless channels with special symmetry, termed q-ary input memoryless symmetric channels (QMSCs), and show that, for these channels, the distribution of channel messages (in form of probability vectors) likewise exhibits this symmetry. Consequently, we define symmetric probability measures and their reference measures on a finite-dimensional probability simplex, analyze their foundational properties and those of their linear functionals, endow their respective spaces with metric topologies, and conduct an in-depth study of their degradation theory. Based on our analytical framework, we establish a universal threshold saturation result for both of the coupled ensembles over a q-ary finite field on QMSCs. Specifically, as the coupling parameters increase, the belief-propagation threshold of a coupled system saturates to a well-defined threshold that depends only on the underlying ensemble and the channel family.

TL;DR: 基于确定性图构造，研究低秩矩阵补全的图结构条件，提出通过自避游走模式检测可补全性的无限图族设计方法，并验证SOS层级对固定秩矩阵补全的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为确定性环境中的低秩矩阵补全问题提供理论保证，特别关注当矩阵条目值未知时仍能确保唯一补全的可能性。

Method: 将图的可补全性与邻接矩阵支撑生成的格图子图中的特定模式（自避游走并集）相关联，基于这些模式设计可确保补全的无限图族，并通过平方和（SOS）层次结构实现固定秩矩阵的精确稳定补全。

Result: 建立了图结构与低秩矩阵唯一可补全性之间的理论联系，并成功构造出无限图族，使得对于任意固定秩矩阵，都能通过SOS层次实现精确且稳定的补全。

Conclusion: 该研究为低秩矩阵补全提供了新的确定性图构造框架，通过图论特征保证了补全的理论可行性，扩展了矩阵补全问题的应用范围。

Abstract: We study deterministic constructions of graphs for which the unique completion of low rank matrices is generically possible regardless of the values of the entries. We relate the completability to the presence of some patterns (particular unions of self-avoiding walks) in the subgraph of the lattice graph generated from the support of the bi-adjacency matrix. The construction makes it possible to design infinite families of graphs on which exact and stable completion is possible for every fixed rank matrix through the sum-of-squares hierarchy.

### [94] [The Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT): A Protocol for Measuring Epistemic Robustness in Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23850)
*Rahul Baxi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 研究人员开发了DDFT协议来评估语言模型在信息压缩和对抗性伪造下的认知鲁棒性，发现模型大小与鲁棒性不相关，错误检测能力是关键瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM评估方法（如MMLU和TruthfulQA）只能测量模型在理想条件下的知识水平，但无法评估其在信息质量下降或面对对抗性攻击时的实际认知鲁棒性。

Method: 提出DDFT协议，基于两系统认知模型（语义系统和认知验证系统），评估9个前沿模型在8个知识领域和5种压缩级别的认知鲁棒性（共1800轮评估）。

Result: 认知鲁棒性与传统设计范式正交：参数数量(r=0.083)和架构类型(r=0.153)均与鲁棒性不显著相关，主要取决于训练方法和验证机制；错误检测能力(rho=-0.817)是鲁棒性的关键预测指标。大模型表现脆弱，小模型也能实现鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: DDFT框架为在关键应用部署前评估语言模型的认知鲁棒性提供了理论基础和实践工具，挑战了模型大小与可靠性的传统假设。

Abstract: Current language model evaluations measure what models know under ideal conditions but not how robustly they know it under realistic stress. Static benchmarks like MMLU and TruthfulQA cannot distinguish a model that lacks knowledge from one whose verification mechanisms collapse when information degrades or adversaries probe for weaknesses. We introduce the Drill-Down and Fabricate Test (DDFT), a protocol that measures epistemic robustness: a model's ability to maintain factual accuracy under progressive semantic compression and adversarial fabrication. We propose a two-system cognitive model comprising a Semantic System that generates fluent text and an Epistemic Verifier that validates factual accuracy. Our findings, based on evaluating 9 frontier models across 8 knowledge domains at 5 compression levels (1,800 turn-level evaluations), reveal that epistemic robustness is orthogonal to conventional design paradigms. Neither parameter count (r=0.083, p=0.832) nor architectural type (r=0.153, p=0.695) significantly predicts robustness, suggesting it emerges from training methodology and verification mechanisms distinct from current approaches. Error detection capability strongly predicts overall robustness (rho=-0.817, p=0.007), indicating this is the critical bottleneck. We find that flagship models exhibit brittleness despite their scale, while smaller models can achieve robust performance, challenging assumptions about the relationship between model size and reliability. The DDFT framework provides both theoretical foundation and practical tools for assessing epistemic robustness before deployment in critical applications.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents currently depend on predefined tools or brittle tool generation, constraining their capability and adaptability to complex scientific tasks. We introduce CASCADE, a self-evolving agentic framework representing an early instantiation of the transition from "LLM + tool use" to "LLM + skill acquisition". CASCADE enables agents to master complex external tools and codify knowledge through two meta-skills: continuous learning via web search and code extraction, and self-reflection via introspection and knowledge graph exploration, among others. We evaluate CASCADE on SciSkillBench, a benchmark of 116 materials science and chemistry research tasks. CASCADE achieves a 93.3% success rate using GPT-5, compared to 35.4% without evolution mechanisms. We further demonstrate real-world applications in computational analysis, autonomous laboratory experiments, and selective reproduction of published papers. Along with human-agent collaboration and memory consolidation, CASCADE accumulates executable skills that can be shared across agents and scientists, moving toward scalable AI-assisted scientific research.

Abstract: Accurate disease prediction is vital for timely intervention, effective treatment, and reducing medical complications. While symbolic AI has been applied in healthcare, its adoption remains limited due to the effort required for constructing high-quality knowledge bases. This work introduces McCoy, a framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Answer Set Programming (ASP) to overcome this barrier. McCoy orchestrates an LLM to translate medical literature into ASP code, combines it with patient data, and processes it using an ASP solver to arrive at the final diagnosis. This integration yields a robust, interpretable prediction framework that leverages the strengths of both paradigms. Preliminary results show McCoy has strong performance on small-scale disease diagnosis tasks.

Abstract: Personalized search demands the ability to model users' evolving, multi-dimensional information needs; a challenge for systems constrained by static profiles or monolithic retrieval pipelines. We present SPARK (Search Personalization via Agent-Driven Retrieval and Knowledge-sharing), a framework in which coordinated persona-based large language model (LLM) agents deliver task-specific retrieval and emergent personalization. SPARK formalizes a persona space defined by role, expertise, task context, and domain, and introduces a Persona Coordinator that dynamically interprets incoming queries to activate the most relevant specialized agents. Each agent executes an independent retrieval-augmented generation process, supported by dedicated long- and short-term memory stores and context-aware reasoning modules. Inter-agent collaboration is facilitated through structured communication protocols, including shared memory repositories, iterative debate, and relay-style knowledge transfer. Drawing on principles from cognitive architectures, multi-agent coordination theory, and information retrieval, SPARK models how emergent personalization properties arise from distributed agent behaviors governed by minimal coordination rules. The framework yields testable predictions regarding coordination efficiency, personalization quality, and cognitive load distribution, while incorporating adaptive learning mechanisms for continuous persona refinement. By integrating fine-grained agent specialization with cooperative retrieval, SPARK provides insights for next-generation search systems capable of capturing the complexity, fluidity, and context sensitivity of human information-seeking behavior.

Abstract: The transition from static Large Language Models (LLMs) to self-improving agents is hindered by the lack of structured reasoning in traditional evolutionary approaches. Existing methods often struggle with premature convergence and inefficient exploration in high-dimensional code spaces. To address these challenges, we introduce LoongFlow, a self-evolving agent framework that achieves state-of-the-art solution quality with significantly reduced computational costs. Unlike "blind" mutation operators, LoongFlow integrates LLMs into a cognitive "Plan-Execute-Summarize" (PES) paradigm, effectively mapping the evolutionary search to a reasoning-heavy process. To sustain long-term architectural coherence, we incorporate a hybrid evolutionary memory system. By synergizing Multi-Island models with MAP-Elites and adaptive Boltzmann selection, this system theoretically balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off, maintaining diverse behavioral niches to prevent optimization stagnation. We instantiate LoongFlow with a General Agent for algorithmic discovery and an ML Agent for pipeline optimization. Extensive evaluations on the AlphaEvolve benchmark and Kaggle competitions demonstrate that LoongFlow outperforms leading baselines (e.g., OpenEvolve, ShinkaEvolve) by up to 60% in evolutionary efficiency while discovering superior solutions. LoongFlow marks a substantial step forward in autonomous scientific discovery, enabling the generation of expert-level solutions with reduced computational overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在推荐系统中存在黑盒特性、知识幻觉和在线学习能力有限等问题，而Soar等认知架构具有结构化推理但知识获取困难。为解决这些互补挑战，需要结合两者的优势。

Method: CogRec以Soar作为核心符号推理引擎，使用LLM进行知识初始化填充工作记忆产生式规则。基于感知-认知-行动循环，当遇到僵局时动态查询LLM获取推理解，通过Soar的组块机制转化为新的符号产生式规则。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的广泛评估表明，CogRec在推荐准确性、可解释性和解决长尾问题方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: CogRec通过LLM与Soar认知架构的协同，实现了持续进化的知识库和高度可解释的推荐理由，有效解决了LLM在推荐系统中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated a remarkable capacity in understanding user preferences for recommendation systems. However, they are constrained by several critical challenges, including their inherent "Black-Box" characteristics, susceptibility to knowledge hallucination, and limited online learning capacity. These factors compromise their trustworthiness and adaptability. Conversely, cognitive architectures such as Soar offer structured and interpretable reasoning processes, yet their knowledge acquisition is notoriously laborious. To address these complementary challenges, we propose a novel cognitive recommender agent called CogRec which synergizes the strengths of LLMs with the Soar cognitive architecture. CogRec leverages Soar as its core symbolic reasoning engine and leverages an LLM for knowledge initialization to populate its working memory with production rules. The agent operates on a Perception-Cognition-Action(PCA) cycle. Upon encountering an impasse, it dynamically queries the LLM to obtain a reasoned solution. This solution is subsequently transformed into a new symbolic production rule via Soar's chunking mechanism, thereby enabling robust online learning. This learning paradigm allows the agent to continuously evolve its knowledge base and furnish highly interpretable rationales for its recommendations. Extensive evaluations conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that CogRec demonstrates significant advantages in recommendation accuracy, explainability, and its efficacy in addressing the long-tail problem.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练、基于图结构的方法，用于解决ARC-AGI-3基准测试中的交互式推理任务。该方法通过对视觉帧的分解与图结构的状态空间探索，在稀疏反馈环境中实现了优于前沿LLM的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ARC-AGI-3包含一系列游戏式任务，要求智能体通过有限交互推断任务机制，并适应逐渐增加的复杂度。现有最先进的LLM难以可靠解决此类任务，因此需要一种能系统性探索状态空间、追踪已发现机制的方法。

Method: 结合视觉帧处理与基于图结构的系统化状态空间探索。首先将视觉帧分割为有意义的组件，基于视觉显著性对动作进行优先级排序，并维护一个记录已探索状态与转移的有向图。通过追踪已访问状态和测试过的动作，智能体优先选择能最快达到未测试状态-动作对的最短路径动作。

Result: 在ARC-AGI-3 Preview Challenge中，该结构化探索策略在6个游戏的52个关卡中中位数解出30关，在私有排行榜上排名第3，显著优于前沿的LLM智能体。

Conclusion: 研究表明，即使无需学习，显式的图结构探索也能为交互式推理提供强大的基线方法，并突显了在稀疏反馈环境中系统性状态追踪和动作优先级排序的重要性——这正是当前LLM难以捕捉任务动态的关键所在。代码已开源。

Abstract: We present a training-free graph-based approach for solving interactive reasoning tasks in the ARC-AGI-3 benchmark. ARC-AGI-3 comprises game-like tasks where agents must infer task mechanics through limited interactions, and adapt to increasing complexity as levels progress. Success requires forming hypotheses, testing them, and tracking discovered mechanics. The benchmark has revealed that state-of-the-art LLMs are currently incapable of reliably solving these tasks. Our method combines vision-based frame processing with systematic state-space exploration using graph-structured representations. It segments visual frames into meaningful components, prioritizes actions based on visual salience, and maintains a directed graph of explored states and transitions. By tracking visited states and tested actions, the agent prioritizes actions that provide the shortest path to untested state-action pairs. On the ARC-AGI-3 Preview Challenge, this structured exploration strategy solves a median of 30 out of 52 levels across six games and ranks 3rd on the private leaderboard, substantially outperforming frontier LLM-based agents. These results demonstrate that explicit graph-structured exploration, even without learning, can serve as a strong baseline for interactive reasoning and underscore the importance of systematic state tracking and action prioritization in sparse-feedback environments where current LLMs fail to capture task dynamics.

Abstract: We introduce SCP: the Science Context Protocol, an open-source standard designed to accelerate discovery by enabling a global network of autonomous scientific agents. SCP is built on two foundational pillars: (1) Unified Resource Integration: At its core, SCP provides a universal specification for describing and invoking scientific resources, spanning software tools, models, datasets, and physical instruments. This protocol-level standardization enables AI agents and applications to discover, call, and compose capabilities seamlessly across disparate platforms and institutional boundaries. (2) Orchestrated Experiment Lifecycle Management: SCP complements the protocol with a secure service architecture, which comprises a centralized SCP Hub and federated SCP Servers. This architecture manages the complete experiment lifecycle (registration, planning, execution, monitoring, and archival), enforces fine-grained authentication and authorization, and orchestrates traceable, end-to-end workflows that bridge computational and physical laboratories. Based on SCP, we have constructed a scientific discovery platform that offers researchers and agents a large-scale ecosystem of more than 1,600 tool resources. Across diverse use cases, SCP facilitates secure, large-scale collaboration between heterogeneous AI systems and human researchers while significantly reducing integration overhead and enhancing reproducibility. By standardizing scientific context and tool orchestration at the protocol level, SCP establishes essential infrastructure for scalable, multi-institution, agent-driven science.

Abstract: When fine-tuning pre-trained Language Models (LMs) to exhibit desired behaviors, maintaining control over risk is critical for ensuring both safety and trustworthiness. Most existing safety alignment methods, such as Safe RLHF and SACPO, typically operate under a risk-neutral paradigm that is insufficient to address the risks arising from deviations from the reference policy and offers limited robustness against rare but potentially catastrophic harmful behaviors. To address this limitation, we propose Risk-aware Stepwise Alignment (RSA), a novel alignment method that explicitly incorporates risk awareness into the policy optimization process by leveraging a class of nested risk measures. Specifically, RSA formulates safety alignment as a token-level risk-aware constrained policy optimization problem and solves it through a stepwise alignment procedure that yields token-level policy updates derived from the nested risk measures. This design offers two key benefits: (1) it mitigates risks induced by excessive model shift away from a reference policy, and (2) it explicitly suppresses low-probability yet high-impact harmful behaviors. Moreover, we provide theoretical analysis on policy optimality under mild assumptions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high levels of helpfulness while ensuring strong safety and significantly suppresses tail risks, namely low-probability yet high-impact unsafe responses.

Conclusion: 所提出的测试时自适应信念优化方法能够有效解决部分可观测环境下的探索性推理问题，在保持低集成开销的同时，显著提高与潜在世界状态的对齐能力。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a test-time adaptive agent that performs exploratory inference through posterior-guided belief refinement without relying on gradient-based updates or additional training for LLM agent operating under partial observability. Our agent maintains an external structured belief over the environment state, iteratively updates it via action-conditioned observations, and selects actions by maximizing predicted information gain over the belief space. We estimate information gain using a lightweight LLM-based surrogate and assess world alignment through a novel reward that quantifies the consistency between posterior belief and ground-truth environment configuration. Experiments show that our method outperforms inference-time scaling baselines such as prompt-augmented or retrieval-enhanced LLMs, in aligning with latent world states with significantly lower integration overhead.

Abstract: A long-standing challenge in AI is to develop agents capable of solving a wide range of physical tasks and generalizing to new, unseen tasks and environments. A popular recent approach involves training a world model from state-action trajectories and subsequently use it with a planning algorithm to solve new tasks. Planning is commonly performed in the input space, but a recent family of methods has introduced planning algorithms that optimize in the learned representation space of the world model, with the promise that abstracting irrelevant details yields more efficient planning. In this work, we characterize models from this family as JEPA-WMs and investigate the technical choices that make algorithms from this class work. We propose a comprehensive study of several key components with the objective of finding the optimal approach within the family. We conducted experiments using both simulated environments and real-world robotic data, and studied how the model architecture, the training objective, and the planning algorithm affect planning success. We combine our findings to propose a model that outperforms two established baselines, DINO-WM and V-JEPA-2-AC, in both navigation and manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Map environments provide a fundamental medium for representing spatial structure. Understanding how foundation model (FM) agents understand and act in such environments is therefore critical for enabling reliable map-based reasoning and applications. However, most existing evaluations of spatial ability in FMs rely on static map inputs or text-based queries, overlooking the interactive and experience-driven nature of spatial understanding.In this paper, we propose an interactive evaluation framework to analyze how FM agents explore, remember, and reason in symbolic map environments. Agents incrementally explore partially observable grid-based maps consisting of roads, intersections, and points of interest (POIs), receiving only local observations at each step. Spatial understanding is then evaluated using six kinds of spatial tasks. By systematically varying exploration strategies, memory representations, and reasoning schemes across multiple foundation models, we reveal distinct functional roles of these components. Exploration primarily affects experience acquisition but has a limited impact on final reasoning accuracy. In contrast, memory representation plays a central role in consolidating spatial experience, with structured memories particularly sequential and graph-based representations, substantially improving performance on structure-intensive tasks such as path planning. Reasoning schemes further shape how stored spatial knowledge is used, with advanced prompts supporting more effective multi-step inference. We further observe that spatial reasoning performance saturates across model versions and scales beyond a certain capability threshold, indicating that improvements in map-based spatial understanding require mechanisms tailored to spatial representation and reasoning rather than scaling alone.

*Samuel Golladay,Majid Bani-Yaghoub*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这项研究通过Missouri Collegiate Mathematics Competition（密苏里大学生数学竞赛）评估了GPT-4o-mini、Gemini-2.0-Flash和DeepSeek-V3在微积分、解析几何和离散数学领域的性能，发现DeepSeek-V3表现最佳，所有LLMs在几何方面表现较弱，并分析了各自的主要错误类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大多数研究使用相同的基准数据集评估LLMs的数学推理能力，这限制了研究结果的泛化性，且可能无法全面反映数学任务的多样性挑战。本研究旨在通过代表性不足的数学竞赛题目来深入分析LLMs的能力局限。

Method: 研究选取了Missouri Collegiate Mathematics Competition的题目，涵盖微积分、解析几何和离散数学三个领域，向GPT-4o-mini、Gemini-2.0-Flash和DeepSeek-V3三类领先的LLMs提问，并将其回答与已知正确解法对比，同时分析LLMs的推理过程，以探索跨问题类型和模型的错误模式。

Result: DeepSeek-V3在微积分、解析几何和离散数学三个领域的推理和最终答案准确性方面表现最佳。三类LLMs均在几何领域表现显著较弱。DeepSeek-V3的主要错误源于计算和逻辑错误；GPT-4o-mini则频繁出现逻辑和方法相关的错误；而Gemini倾向于不完整的推理和草率得出结论。

Conclusion: 在代表性不足的数学竞赛数据集上评估LLMs，能够更深入地洞察其独特的错误模式，并突显出LLMs在结构化推理（尤其是在几何领域）方面存在的持续挑战。

Abstract: Understanding the limitations of Large Language Models, or LLMs, in mathematical reasoning has been the focus of several recent studies. However, the majority of these studies use the same datasets for benchmarking, which limits the generalizability of their findings and may not fully capture the diverse challenges present in mathematical tasks. The purpose of the present study is to analyze the performance of LLMs on underrepresented mathematics competition problems. We prompted three leading LLMs, namely GPT-4o-mini, Gemini-2.0-Flash, and DeepSeek-V3, with the Missouri Collegiate Mathematics Competition problems in the areas of Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics. The LLMs responses were then compared to the known correct solutions in order to determine the accuracy of the LLM for each problem domain. We also analyzed the LLMs reasoning to explore patterns in errors across problem types and models. DeepSeek-V3 has the best performance in all three categories of Calculus, Analytic Geometry, and Discrete Mathematics, both in reasoning and correct final answers. All three LLMs exhibited notably weak performance in Geometry. The majority of errors made by DeepSeek-V3 were attributed to computational and logical mistakes, whereas GPT-4o-mini frequently exhibited logical and approach-related errors. Gemini, on the other hand, tended to struggle with incomplete reasoning and drawing rushed conclusions. In conclusion, evaluating LLMs on underrepresented mathematics competition datasets can provide deeper insights into their distinct error patterns and highlight ongoing challenges in structured reasoning, particularly within the domain of Geometry.

TL;DR: 针对大语言模型在空间推理任务中的不足，提出两阶段方法：先通过监督微调学习基本空间变换，再训练LoRA适配器在GRPO框架下进行多步规划，在ASCII环境和谜题任务中表现优于基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型具有较强的通用语言能力，但在结构化环境中的空间变换和多步规划任务上仍存在困难，特别是在导航和规划应用中存在局限性。

Method: 两阶段方法：1）对基本空间变换（旋转、平移、缩放）进行监督微调，使模型具备基础空间物理知识；2）冻结该物理感知模型，在GRPO框架下训练轻量级LoRA适配器，以学习组合这些基础模块进行多步规划。使用合成的ASCII艺术数据集和相应的强化学习环境进行评估。

Result: 该方法在显式状态更新的动态环境和依赖内部状态的静态环境中均优于基线（包括通用主干模型、物理感知模型和端到端RL模型），且收敛更快、训练更稳定。注意力模式分析表明微调确实改善了空间理解。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段分解方法将空间推理分解为原子建构块及其组合，能有效提升大语言模型在结构化环境中的空间推理能力，特别是在多步规划和空间变换任务上。该方法比端到端方法更具效率和稳定性。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in large language models (LLMs) has gained increasing attention due to applications in navigation and planning. Despite strong general language capabilities, LLMs still struggle with spatial transformations and multi-step planning in structured environments. We propose a two-stage approach that decomposes spatial reasoning into atomic building blocks and their composition. First, we apply supervised fine-tuning on elementary spatial transformations, such as rotation, translation, and scaling, to equip the model with basic spatial physics. We then freeze this physics-aware model and train lightweight LoRA adapters within the GRPO framework to learn policies that compose these building blocks for multi-step planning in puzzle-based environments, in a closed-loop manner. To support this pipeline, we synthesize an ASCII-art dataset and construct a corresponding ASCII-based reinforcement learning environment. Our method consistently outperforms baselines, including the generic backbone, physics-aware model, and end-to-end RL models, under both Dynamic environments with explicit state updates and Static environments where the model must rely on its internal state across steps. In addition, the proposed approach converges faster and exhibits more stable training compared to end-to-end reinforcement learning from scratch. Finally, we analyze attention patterns to assess whether fine-tuning induces meaningful improvements in spatial understanding.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly serving as autonomous agents, and their utilization of external tools via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is considered a future trend. Current MCP evaluation sets suffer from issues such as reliance on external MCP services and a lack of difficulty awareness. To address these limitations, we propose MCPAgentBench, a benchmark based on real-world MCP definitions designed to evaluate the tool-use capabilities of agents. We construct a dataset containing authentic tasks and simulated MCP tools. The evaluation employs a dynamic sandbox environment that presents agents with candidate tool lists containing distractors, thereby testing their tool selection and discrimination abilities. Furthermore, we introduce comprehensive metrics to measure both task completion rates and execution efficiency. Experiments conducted on various latest mainstream Large Language Models reveal significant performance differences in handling complex, multi-step tool invocations. All code is open-source at Github.

Abstract: We study allowing large language models (LLMs) to process arbitrarily long prompts through the lens of inference-time scaling. We propose Recursive Language Models (RLMs), a general inference strategy that treats long prompts as part of an external environment and allows the LLM to programmatically examine, decompose, and recursively call itself over snippets of the prompt. We find that RLMs successfully handle inputs up to two orders of magnitude beyond model context windows and, even for shorter prompts, dramatically outperform the quality of base LLMs and common long-context scaffolds across four diverse long-context tasks, while having comparable (or cheaper) cost per query.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in language tasks but often lack collaborative awareness and struggle to optimize global performance in multi-agent settings. We present a reinforcement learning-augmented LLM agent framework that formulates cooperation as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) and adopts centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE). We introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to jointly optimize agent policies with access to global signals during training, together with a simplified joint reward that balances task quality, speed, and coordination cost. On collaborative writing and coding benchmarks, our framework delivers a 3x increase in task processing speed over single-agent baselines, 98.7% structural/style consistency in writing, and a 74.6% test pass rate in coding. The approach consistently outperforms strong multi-agent LLM baselines and provides a practical path toward reliable collaboration in complex workflows.

Abstract: This paper proposes a group deliberation oriented multi-agent conversational model to address the limitations of single large language models in complex reasoning tasks. The model adopts a three-level role division architecture consisting of generation, verification, and integration. An opinion generation agent produces diverse reasoning perspectives, an evidence verification agent retrieves external knowledge and quantifies factual support, and a consistency arbitration agent integrates logically coherent conclusions. A self-game mechanism is introduced to expand multi-path reasoning trajectories, while a retrieval enhancement module dynamically supplements external knowledge. A composite reward function combining factual consistency and logical coherence is designed, and an improved proximal policy optimization strategy is applied for collaborative training. Experimental results show that the proposed model improves multi-hop reasoning accuracy by 16.8 percent on HotpotQA, 14.3 percent on 2WikiMultihopQA, and 19.2 percent on MeetingBank, while improving consistency by 21.5 percent. The model achieves higher reasoning efficiency than mainstream multi-agent approaches, providing an effective and stable solution for complex reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Existing Large Language Model (LLM) agent frameworks face two significant challenges: high configuration costs and static capabilities. Building a high-quality agent often requires extensive manual effort in tool integration and prompt engineering, while deployed agents struggle to adapt to dynamic environments without expensive fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{Youtu-Agent}, a modular framework designed for the automated generation and continuous evolution of LLM agents. Youtu-Agent features a structured configuration system that decouples execution environments, toolkits, and context management, enabling flexible reuse and automated synthesis. We introduce two generation paradigms: a \textbf{Workflow} mode for standard tasks and a \textbf{Meta-Agent} mode for complex, non-standard requirements, capable of automatically generating tool code, prompts, and configurations. Furthermore, Youtu-Agent establishes a hybrid policy optimization system: (1) an \textbf{Agent Practice} module that enables agents to accumulate experience and improve performance through in-context optimization without parameter updates; and (2) an \textbf{Agent RL} module that integrates with distributed training frameworks to enable scalable and stable reinforcement learning of any Youtu-Agents in an end-to-end, large-scale manner. Experiments demonstrate that Youtu-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance on WebWalkerQA (71.47\%) and GAIA (72.8\%) using open-weight models. Our automated generation pipeline achieves over 81\% tool synthesis success rate, while the Practice module improves performance on AIME 2024/2025 by +2.7\% and +5.4\% respectively. Moreover, our Agent RL training achieves 40\% speedup with steady performance improvement on 7B LLMs, enhancing coding/reasoning and searching capabilities respectively up to 35\% and 21\% on Maths and general/multi-hop QA benchmarks.

Abstract: Intelligent fault diagnosis has become an indispensable technique for ensuring machinery reliability. However, existing methods suffer significant performance decline in real-world scenarios where models are tested under unseen working conditions, while domain adaptation approaches are limited to their reliance on target domain samples. Moreover, most existing studies rely on single-modal sensing signals, overlooking the complementary nature of multi-modal information for improving model generalization. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-modal cross-domain mixed fusion model with dual disentanglement for fault diagnosis. A dual disentanglement framework is developed to decouple modality-invariant and modality-specific features, as well as domain-invariant and domain-specific representations, enabling both comprehensive multi-modal representation learning and robust domain generalization. A cross-domain mixed fusion strategy is designed to randomly mix modality information across domains for modality and domain diversity augmentation. Furthermore, a triple-modal fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively integrate multi-modal heterogeneous information. Extensive experiments are conducted on induction motor fault diagnosis under both unseen constant and time-varying working conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms advanced methods and comprehensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of each proposed component and multi-modal fusion.

Abstract: Fault diagnosis of lithium-ion batteries is critical for system safety. While existing deep learning methods exhibit superior detection accuracy, their "black-box" nature hinders interpretability. Furthermore, restricted by binary classification paradigms, they struggle to provide root cause analysis and maintenance recommendations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes BatteryAgent, a hierarchical framework that integrates physical knowledge features with the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework comprises three core modules: (1) A Physical Perception Layer that utilizes 10 mechanism-based features derived from electrochemical principles, balancing dimensionality reduction with physical fidelity; (2) A Detection and Attribution Layer that employs Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and SHAP to quantify feature contributions; and (3) A Reasoning and Diagnosis Layer that leverages an LLM as the agent core. This layer constructs a "numerical-semantic" bridge, combining SHAP attributions with a mechanism knowledge base to generate comprehensive reports containing fault types, root cause analysis, and maintenance suggestions. Experimental results demonstrate that BatteryAgent effectively corrects misclassifications on hard boundary samples, achieving an AUROC of 0.986, which significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the framework extends traditional binary detection to multi-type interpretable diagnosis, offering a new paradigm shift from "passive detection" to "intelligent diagnosis" for battery safety management.

Abstract: Robotic systems for household object rearrangement often rely on latent preference models inferred from human demonstrations. While effective at prediction, these models offer limited insight into the interpretable factors that guide human decisions. We introduce an explicit formulation of object arrangement preferences along four interpretable constructs: spatial practicality (putting items where they naturally fit best in the space), habitual convenience (making frequently used items easy to reach), semantic coherence (placing items together if they are used for the same task or are contextually related), and commonsense appropriateness (putting things where people would usually expect to find them). To capture these constructs, we designed and validated a self-report questionnaire through a 63-participant online study. Results confirm the psychological distinctiveness of these constructs and their explanatory power across two scenarios (kitchen and living room). We demonstrate the utility of these constructs by integrating them into a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner and show that when guided by participant-derived preferences, our planner can generate reasonable arrangements that closely align with those generated by participants. This work contributes a compact, interpretable formulation of object arrangement preferences and a demonstration of how it can be operationalized for robot planning.

Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然拥有广泛的领域知识，但通常无法捕获对预测任务至关重要的数据集特定模式。为了解决这一问题，研究团队提出了GenZ，旨在通过可解释的语义特征将基础模型与统计建模相结合，从而获得更准确的预测结果。

Method: 该方法通过迭代过程发现语义特征描述，对比基于统计建模错误识别的项目组，而非仅仅依赖基础模型的领域理解。将其形式化为广义EM算法，联合优化语义特征描述符和统计模型参数。使用冻结的基础模型根据发现的特征对项目进行分类，将这些判断视为预测实值目标的潜在二值特征的噪声观测。

Result: 在房价预测方面，模型使用多模态列表数据发现的语义特征实现了12%的中位数相对误差，显著优于依赖LLM通用领域知识的GPT-5基线（38%误差）。对于Netflix电影嵌入，模型从语义描述中预测协同过滤表示，获得了0.59的余弦相似度——这相当于传统协同过滤需要约4000个用户评分才能达到的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功发现了与数据集特定模式相关的语义特征，这些模式与单独依赖模型领域知识时的做法存在差异（例如预测本地房地产市场的建筑细节、预测用户偏好的特许经营成员身份）。这为基础模型与统计建模的有效融合提供了实证支持。

Abstract: We present GenZ, a hybrid model that bridges foundational models and statistical modeling through interpretable semantic features. While large language models possess broad domain knowledge, they often fail to capture dataset-specific patterns critical for prediction tasks. Our approach addresses this by discovering semantic feature descriptions through an iterative process that contrasts groups of items identified via statistical modeling errors, rather than relying solely on the foundational model's domain understanding. We formulate this as a generalized EM algorithm that jointly optimizes semantic feature descriptors and statistical model parameters. The method prompts a frozen foundational model to classify items based on discovered features, treating these judgments as noisy observations of latent binary features that predict real-valued targets through learned statistical relationships. We demonstrate the approach on two domains: house price prediction (hedonic regression) and cold-start collaborative filtering for movie recommendations. On house prices, our model achieves 12\% median relative error using discovered semantic features from multimodal listing data, substantially outperforming a GPT-5 baseline (38\% error) that relies on the LLM's general domain knowledge. For Netflix movie embeddings, our model predicts collaborative filtering representations with 0.59 cosine similarity purely from semantic descriptions -- matching the performance that would require approximately 4000 user ratings through traditional collaborative filtering. The discovered features reveal dataset-specific patterns (e.g., architectural details predicting local housing markets, franchise membership predicting user preferences) that diverge from the model's domain knowledge alone.

Abstract: Technologies for automatically generating work schedules have been extensively studied; however, in long-term care facilities, the conditions vary between facilities, making it essential to interview the managers who create shift schedules to design facility-specific constraint conditions. The proposed method utilizes constraint templates to extract combinations of various components, such as shift patterns for consecutive days or staff combinations. The templates can extract a variety of constraints by changing the number of days and the number of staff members to focus on and changing the extraction focus to patterns or frequency. In addition, unlike existing constraint extraction techniques, this study incorporates mechanisms to exclude exceptional constraints. The extracted constraints can be employed by a constraint programming solver to create care worker schedules. Experiments demonstrated that our proposed method successfully created schedules that satisfied all hard constraints and reduced the number of violations for soft constraints by circumventing the extraction of exceptional constraints.

Abstract: Agentic crafting requires LLMs to operate in real-world environments over multiple turns by taking actions, observing outcomes, and iteratively refining artifacts. Despite its importance, the open-source community lacks a principled, end-to-end ecosystem to streamline agent development. We introduce the Agentic Learning Ecosystem (ALE), a foundational infrastructure that optimizes the production pipeline for agent LLMs. ALE consists of three components: ROLL, a post-training framework for weight optimization; ROCK, a sandbox environment manager for trajectory generation; and iFlow CLI, an agent framework for efficient context engineering. We release ROME (ROME is Obviously an Agentic Model), an open-source agent grounded by ALE and trained on over one million trajectories. Our approach includes data composition protocols for synthesizing complex behaviors and a novel policy optimization algorithm, Interaction-based Policy Alignment (IPA), which assigns credit over semantic interaction chunks rather than individual tokens to improve long-horizon training stability. Empirically, we evaluate ROME within a structured setting and introduce Terminal Bench Pro, a benchmark with improved scale and contamination control. ROME demonstrates strong performance across benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified and Terminal Bench, proving the effectiveness of the ALE infrastructure.

Abstract: This report presents the design and implementation of a semi-automated data annotation pipeline developed within the DARTS project, whose goal is to create a large-scale, multimodal dataset of driving scenarios recorded in Polish conditions. Manual annotation of such heterogeneous data is both costly and time-consuming. To address this challenge, the proposed solution adopts a human-in-the-loop approach that combines artificial intelligence with human expertise to reduce annotation cost and duration. The system automatically generates initial annotations, enables iterative model retraining, and incorporates data anonymization and domain adaptation techniques. At its core, the tool relies on 3D object detection algorithms to produce preliminary annotations. Overall, the developed tools and methodology result in substantial time savings while ensuring consistent, high-quality annotations across different sensor modalities. The solution directly supports the DARTS project by accelerating the preparation of large annotated dataset in the project's standardized format, strengthening the technological base for autonomous vehicle research in Poland.

TL;DR: 本文通过迭代部署及用户数据筛选，证明大语言模型的规划能力能够得到显著提升与泛化，并在理论上将其与强化学习的循环外训练相关联，揭示了其在AI安全与替代训练机制方面的双重意义。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大语言模型在迭代部署过程中，通过用户筛选的前代模型数据实现微调，是否能有效提升模型性能并导致性质转变，同时在理论上分析这种部署机制与强化学习的联系，以探讨其对AI安全和训练方法的潜在影响。

Method: 在多个规划领域测试迭代部署机制：每一轮部署后，用户从前代模型输出中筛选高质量数据用于下一代模型的微调，形成从部署到数据过滤再到微调的循环；最后通过理论分析将该过程构建为强化学习的隐式外循环训练框架。

Result: 模型在规划技能上取得了显著进步，后续模型展现出对新长规划问题的泛化能力，能够发现比初始模型长得多的问题解决方案；理论分析证实，这种迭代部署机制实质上实现了以隐式奖励函数驱动的强化学习外循环训练。

Conclusion: 迭代部署通过用户数据筛选能够驱动大语言模型实现持续的技能提升与性质转变，其在机制上等价于隐式奖励驱动的强化学习外循环；这对于AI安全尤为重要——因为隐式奖励未经明确定义，可能导致未来部署模型的性质出现未预期的变化；同时该机制也可作为依赖数据筛选而非明确奖励的新型训练方案。

Abstract: We show that iterative deployment of large language models (LLMs), each fine-tuned on data carefully curated by users from the previous models' deployment, can significantly change the properties of the resultant models. By testing this mechanism on various planning domains, we observe substantial improvements in planning skills, with later models displaying emergent generalization by discovering much longer plans than the initial models. We then provide theoretical analysis showing that iterative deployment effectively implements reinforcement learning (RL) training in the outer-loop (i.e. not as part of intentional model training), with an implicit reward function. The connection to RL has two important implications: first, for the field of AI safety, as the reward function entailed by repeated deployment is not defined explicitly, and could have unexpected implications to the properties of future model deployments. Second, the mechanism highlighted here can be viewed as an alternative training regime to explicit RL, relying on data curation rather than explicit rewards.

Abstract: We present STAgent, an agentic large language model tailored for spatio-temporal understanding, designed to solve complex tasks such as constrained point-of-interest discovery and itinerary planning. STAgent is a specialized model capable of interacting with ten distinct tools within spatio-temporal scenarios, enabling it to explore, verify, and refine intermediate steps during complex reasoning. Notably, STAgent effectively preserves its general capabilities. We empower STAgent with these capabilities through three key contributions: (1) a stable tool environment that supports over ten domain-specific tools, enabling asynchronous rollout and training; (2) a hierarchical data curation framework that identifies high-quality data like a needle in a haystack, curating high-quality queries with a filter ratio of 1:10,000, emphasizing both diversity and difficulty; and (3) a cascaded training recipe that starts with a seed SFT stage acting as a guardian to measure query difficulty, followed by a second SFT stage fine-tuned on queries with high certainty, and an ultimate RL stage that leverages data of low certainty. Initialized with Qwen3-30B-A3B to establish a strong SFT foundation and leverage insights into sample difficulty, STAgent yields promising performance on TravelBench while maintaining its general capabilities across a wide range of general benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed agentic model.

Abstract: This study presents a conceptual framework and a prototype assessment for Large Language Model (LLM)-based Building Energy Management System (BEMS) AI agents to facilitate context-aware energy management in smart buildings through natural language interaction. The proposed framework comprises three modules: perception (sensing), central control (brain), and action (actuation and user interaction), forming a closed feedback loop that captures, analyzes, and interprets energy data to respond intelligently to user queries and manage connected appliances. By leveraging the autonomous data analytics capabilities of LLMs, the BEMS AI agent seeks to offer context-aware insights into energy consumption, cost prediction, and device scheduling, thereby addressing limitations in existing energy management systems. The prototype's performance was evaluated using 120 user queries across four distinct real-world residential energy datasets and different evaluation metrics, including latency, functionality, capability, accuracy, and cost-effectiveness. The generalizability of the framework was demonstrated using ANOVA tests. The results revealed promising performance, measured by response accuracy in device control (86%), memory-related tasks (97%), scheduling and automation (74%), and energy analysis (77%), while more complex cost estimation tasks highlighted areas for improvement with an accuracy of 49%. This benchmarking study moves toward formalizing the assessment of LLM-based BEMS AI agents and identifying future research directions, emphasizing the trade-off between response accuracy and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Online gaming is a popular activity involving the adoption of complex systems and network infrastructures. The relevance of gaming, which generates large amounts of market revenue, drove research in modeling network devices' behavior to evaluate bandwidth consumption, predict and sustain high loads, and detect malicious activity. In this context, process mining appears promising due to its ability to combine data-driven analyses with model-based insights. In this paper, we propose a process mining-based method that analyzes gaming network traffic, allowing: unsupervised characterization of different states from gaming network data; encoding such states through process mining into interpretable Petri nets; and classification of gaming network traffic data to identify different video games being played. We apply the method to the UPSIDE case study, involving gaming network data of several devices interacting with two video games: Clash Royale and Rocket League. Results demonstrate that the gaming network behavior can be effectively and interpretably modeled through states represented as Petri nets with sufficient coherence (94.02% inter-device similarity) and specificity (174.99% inter-state separation) while maintaining a good classification accuracy of the two different video games (73.84% AUC).

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has been widely adopted in diverse industrial domains, including autonomous driving, intelligent healthcare, and aided programming. Like traditional software, DL systems are also prone to faults, whose malfunctioning may expose users to significant risks. Consequently, numerous approaches have been proposed to address these issues. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study on 16 state-of-the-art DL model fixing approaches, spanning model-level, layer-level, and neuron-level categories, to comprehensively evaluate their performance. We assess not only their fixing effectiveness (their primary purpose) but also their impact on other critical properties, such as robustness, fairness, and backward compatibility. To ensure comprehensive and fair evaluation, we employ a diverse set of datasets, model architectures, and application domains within a uniform experimental setup for experimentation. We summarize several key findings with implications for both industry and academia. For example, model-level approaches demonstrate superior fixing effectiveness compared to others. No single approach can achieve the best fixing performance while improving accuracy and maintaining all other properties. Thus, academia should prioritize research on mitigating these side effects. These insights highlight promising directions for future exploration in this field.

Abstract: For complex simulation problems, inferring parameters of scientific interest often precludes the use of classical likelihood-based techniques due to intractable likelihood functions. Simulation-based inference (SBI) methods forego the need for explicit likelihoods by directly utilizing samples from the simulator to learn posterior distributions over parameters $\mathbfθ$ given observed data $\mathbf{x}_{\text{o}}$. Recent work has brought attention to diffusion models -- a type of generative model rooted in score matching and reverse-time stochastic dynamics -- as a flexible framework SBI tasks. This article reviews diffusion-based SBI from first principles to applications in practice. We first recall the mathematical foundations of diffusion modeling (forward noising, reverse-time SDE/ODE, probability flow, and denoising score matching) and explain how conditional scores enable likelihood-free posterior sampling. We then examine where diffusion models address pain points of normalizing flows in neural posterior/likelihood estimation and where they introduce new trade-offs (e.g., iterative sampling costs). The key theme of this review is robustness of diffusion-based SBI in non-ideal conditions common to scientific data: misspecification (mismatch between simulated training data and reality), unstructured or infinite-dimensional observations, and missingness. We synthesize methods spanning foundations drawing from Schrodinger-bridge formulations, conditional and sequential posterior samplers, amortized architectures for unstructured data, and inference-time prior adaptation. Throughout, we adopt consistent notation and emphasize conditions and caveats required for accurate posteriors. The review closes with a discussion of open problems with an eye toward applications of uncertainty quantification for probabilistic geophysical models that may benefit from diffusion-based SBI.

Abstract: Human-level concept learning argues that humans typically learn new concepts from a single example, whereas machine learning algorithms typically require hundreds of samples to learn a single concept. Our brain subconsciously identifies important features and learns more effectively. \vspace*{6pt}
  Contribution: In this paper, we present the Coordinate Matrix Machine (CM$^2$). This purpose-built small model augments human intelligence by learning document structures and using this information to classify documents. While modern "Red AI" trends rely on massive pre-training and energy-intensive GPU infrastructure, CM$^2$ is designed as a Green AI solution. It achieves human-level concept learning by identifying only the structural "important features" a human would consider, allowing it to classify very similar documents using only one sample per class.
  Advantage: Our algorithm outperforms traditional vectorizers and complex deep learning models that require larger datasets and significant compute. By focusing on structural coordinates rather than exhaustive semantic vectors, CM$^2$ offers: 1. High accuracy with minimal data (one-shot learning) 2. Geometric and structural intelligence 3. Green AI and environmental sustainability 4. Optimized for CPU-only environments 5. Inherent explainability (glass-box model) 6. Faster computation and low latency 7. Robustness against unbalanced classes 8. Economic viability 9. Generic, expandable, and extendable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent work has shown that small transformers trained in controlled "wind-tunnel'' settings can implement exact Bayesian inference, and that their training dynamics produce a geometric substrate -- low-dimensional value manifolds and progressively orthogonal keys -- that encodes posterior structure. We investigate whether this geometric signature persists in production-grade language models. Across Pythia, Phi-2, Llama-3, and Mistral families, we find that last-layer value representations organize along a single dominant axis whose position strongly correlates with predictive entropy, and that domain-restricted prompts collapse this structure into the same low-dimensional manifolds observed in synthetic settings.
  To probe the role of this geometry, we perform targeted interventions on the entropy-aligned axis of Pythia-410M during in-context learning. Removing or perturbing this axis selectively disrupts the local uncertainty geometry, whereas matched random-axis interventions leave it intact. However, these single-layer manipulations do not produce proportionally specific degradation in Bayesian-like behavior, indicating that the geometry is a privileged readout of uncertainty rather than a singular computational bottleneck. Taken together, our results show that modern language models preserve the geometric substrate that enables Bayesian inference in wind tunnels, and organize their approximate Bayesian updates along this substrate.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Evidential deep learning (EDL) models, based on Subjective Logic, introduce a principled and computationally efficient way to make deterministic neural networks uncertainty-aware. The resulting evidential models can quantify fine-grained uncertainty using learned evidence. However, the Subjective-Logic framework constrains evidence to be non-negative, requiring specific activation functions whose geometric properties can induce activation-dependent learning-freeze behavior: a regime where gradients become extremely small for samples mapped into low-evidence regions. We theoretically characterize this behavior and analyze how different evidential activations influence learning dynamics. Building on this analysis, we design a general family of activation functions and corresponding evidential regularizers that provide an alternative pathway for consistent evidence updates across activation regimes. Extensive experiments on four benchmark classification problems (MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet), two few-shot classification problems, and blind face restoration problem empirically validate the developed theory and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed generalized regularized evidential models.

Abstract: Human decision-making, emotions, and collective psychology are complex factors that shape the temporal dynamics observed in financial and economic systems. Many recent time series forecasting models leverage external sources (e.g., news and social media) to capture human factors, but these approaches incur high data dependency costs in terms of financial, computational, and practical implications. In this study, we propose HINTS, a self-supervised learning framework that extracts these latent factors endogenously from time series residuals without external data. HINTS leverages the Friedkin-Johnsen (FJ) opinion dynamics model as a structural inductive bias to model evolving social influence, memory, and bias patterns. The extracted human factors are integrated into a state-of-the-art backbone model as an attention map. Experimental results using nine real-world and benchmark datasets demonstrate that HINTS consistently improves forecasting accuracy. Furthermore, multiple case studies and ablation studies validate the interpretability of HINTS, demonstrating strong semantic alignment between the extracted factors and real-world events, demonstrating the practical utility of HINTS.

Abstract: We introduce Neural Optimal Design of Experiments, a learning-based framework for optimal experimental design in inverse problems that avoids classical bilevel optimization and indirect sparsity regularization. NODE jointly trains a neural reconstruction model and a fixed-budget set of continuous design variables representing sensor locations, sampling times, or measurement angles, within a single optimization loop. By optimizing measurement locations directly rather than weighting a dense grid of candidates, the proposed approach enforces sparsity by design, eliminates the need for l1 tuning, and substantially reduces computational complexity. We validate NODE on an analytically tractable exponential growth benchmark, on MNIST image sampling, and illustrate its effectiveness on a real world sparse view X ray CT example. In all cases, NODE outperforms baseline approaches, demonstrating improved reconstruction accuracy and task-specific performance.

Motivation: 在子空间聚类任务中，如何为数据集或簇计算合适的几何代表（如均值或中位数）是关键问题。但现有方法在保持几何结构的同时难以获得高质量聚类结果。

Method: 引入舒伯特最优拟合变体（SVBF）作为可训练聚类原型，它是在固定方向上尽可能接近与每个簇成员相交的子空间。将SVBF集成到LBG算法管道中，形成SVBF-LBG聚类方案。

Result: 在合成数据、图像数据、光谱数据和视频动作数据上，SVBF-LBG相比传统方法获得了更高的聚类纯度，同时保持了向下游分析所需的数学结构。

Conclusion: SVBF-LBG算法提供了一种有效的子空间聚类方法，通过可训练的几何原型在多个数据类型上显著提升了聚类性能。

Abstract: In many classification and clustering tasks, it is useful to compute a geometric representative for a dataset or a cluster, such as a mean or median. When datasets are represented by subspaces, these representatives become points on the Grassmann or flag manifold, with distances induced by their geometry, often via principal angles. We introduce a subspace clustering algorithm that replaces subspace means with a trainable prototype defined as a Schubert Variety of Best Fit (SVBF) - a subspace that comes as close as possible to intersecting each cluster member in at least one fixed direction. Integrated in the Linde-Buzo-Grey (LBG) pipeline, this SVBF-LBG scheme yields improved cluster purity on synthetic, image, spectral, and video action data, while retaining the mathematical structure required for downstream analysis.

Conclusion: SB-TRPO通过理论保证局部安全进展和梯度对齐时的奖励改进，为硬约束强化学习提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in safety-critical domains requires agents to maximise rewards while strictly adhering to safety constraints. Existing approaches, such as Lagrangian and projection-based methods, often either fail to ensure near-zero safety violations or sacrifice reward performance in the face of hard constraints. We propose Safety-Biased Trust Region Policy Optimisation (SB-TRPO), a new trust-region algorithm for hard-constrained RL. SB-TRPO adaptively biases policy updates towards constraint satisfaction while still seeking reward improvement. Concretely, it performs trust-region updates using a convex combination of the natural policy gradients of cost and reward, ensuring a fixed fraction of optimal cost reduction at each step. We provide a theoretical guarantee of local progress towards safety, with reward improvement when gradients are suitably aligned. Experiments on standard and challenging Safety Gymnasium tasks show that SB-TRPO consistently achieves the best balance of safety and meaningful task completion compared to state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法主要面向现货市场，无法直接应用于高杠杆期货市场。高杠杆会放大奖励波动导致训练难以收敛，且先前方法缺乏对能力边界的自我认知，在遇到新市场状态（如黑天鹅事件）时面临重大亏损风险。

Method: FineFT包含三个阶段：1) 使用集成TD误差选择性更新集成Q学习器以提高收敛性；2) 基于盈利能力筛选Q学习器，并使用VAE在市场状态上训练以识别学习器能力边界；3) 根据训练好的VAE指导，从筛选后的集成和保守策略中选择，以保持盈利并降低新市场状态风险。

Result: 在高频交易环境（5倍杠杆）的加密货币期货实验中，FineFT在6个金融指标上优于12个SOTA基线方法，风险降低超过40%，同时获得比次优方法更好的盈利能力。可视化显示不同智能体专注于不同的市场动态，消融研究证实VAE路由有效降低最大回撤，选择性更新提高了收敛性和性能。

Conclusion: FineFT通过集成强化学习和风险感知机制，成功解决了高杠杆期货交易中的训练不稳定性问题，并提供了一种有效的能力边界识别和风险管理框架，在保持盈利能力的同时显著降低了交易风险。

Abstract: Futures are contracts obligating the exchange of an asset at a predetermined date and price, notable for their high leverage and liquidity and, therefore, thrive in the Crypto market. RL has been widely applied in various quantitative tasks. However, most methods focus on the spot and could not be directly applied to the futures market with high leverage because of 2 challenges. First, high leverage amplifies reward fluctuations, making training stochastic and difficult to converge. Second, prior works lacked self-awareness of capability boundaries, exposing them to the risk of significant loss when encountering new market state (e.g.,a black swan event like COVID-19). To tackle these challenges, we propose the Efficient and Risk-Aware Ensemble Reinforcement Learning for Futures Trading (FineFT), a novel three-stage ensemble RL framework with stable training and proper risk management. In stage I, ensemble Q learners are selectively updated by ensemble TD errors to improve convergence. In stage II, we filter the Q-learners based on their profitabilities and train VAEs on market states to identify the capability boundaries of the learners. In stage III, we choose from the filtered ensemble and a conservative policy, guided by trained VAEs, to maintain profitability and mitigate risk with new market states. Through extensive experiments on crypto futures in a high-frequency trading environment with high fidelity and 5x leverage, we demonstrate that FineFT outperforms 12 SOTA baselines in 6 financial metrics, reducing risk by more than 40% while achieving superior profitability compared to the runner-up. Visualization of the selective update mechanism shows that different agents specialize in distinct market dynamics, and ablation studies certify routing with VAEs reduces maximum drawdown effectively, and selective update improves convergence and performance.

Motivation: 当前研究缺乏对语言模型私密性（隐私约束）和鲁棒性（对抗污染）同时考虑的理论分析，需要建立统一的框架来处理这两个维度的挑战。

Method: 采用理论分析方法：1）针对隐私-only场景，使用MLE风格的算法和log损失函数；2）针对隐私+污染联合场景，改进现有离线算法并首次提出在线对齐算法；3）建立log损失和平方损失在隐私和污染下的均匀收敛界限。

Result: 1）隐私-only场景中，log损失达到近似最优收敛率；2）隐私+污染联合场景下，现有算法比已知具有更强的保证；3）首次提出了私密鲁棒的在线对齐结果；4）建立了适用于更广泛学习理论的新收敛保证。

Conclusion: 该研究为语言模型的私密鲁棒对齐提供了统一的理论框架，揭示了隐私约束与对抗污染交互的理论性质，并为在线环境下的对齐问题开辟了新的研究方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the private and robust alignment of language models from a theoretical perspective by establishing upper bounds on the suboptimality gap in both offline and online settings. We consider preference labels subject to privacy constraints and/or adversarial corruption, and analyze two distinct interplays between them: privacy-first and corruption-first. For the privacy-only setting, we show that log loss with an MLE-style algorithm achieves near-optimal rates, in contrast to conventional wisdom. For the joint privacy-and-corruption setting, we first demonstrate that existing offline algorithms in fact provide stronger guarantees -- simultaneously in terms of corruption level and privacy parameters -- than previously known, which further yields improved bounds in the corruption-only regime. In addition, we also present the first set of results for private and robust online alignment. Our results are enabled by new uniform convergence guarantees for log loss and square loss under privacy and corruption, which we believe have broad applicability across learning theory and statistics.

Abstract: Time series imputation, i.e., filling the missing values of a time recording, finds various applications in electricity, finance, and weather modelling. Previous methods have introduced generative models such as diffusion probabilistic models and Schrodinger bridge models to conditionally generate the missing values from Gaussian noise or directly from linear interpolation results. However, as their prior is not informative to the ground-truth target, their generation process inevitably suffer increased burden and limited imputation accuracy. In this work, we present Bridge-TS, building a data-to-data generation process for generative time series imputation and exploiting the design of prior with two novel designs. Firstly, we propose expert prior, leveraging a pretrained transformer-based module as an expert to fill the missing values with a deterministic estimation, and then taking the results as the prior of ground truth target. Secondly, we explore compositional priors, utilizing several pretrained models to provide different estimation results, and then combining them in the data-to-data generation process to achieve a compositional priors-to-target imputation process. Experiments conducted on several benchmark datasets such as ETT, Exchange, and Weather show that Bridge-TS reaches a new record of imputation accuracy in terms of mean square error and mean absolute error, demonstrating the superiority of improving prior for generative time series imputation.

Motivation: 现有学习系统在非平稳和安全关键环境中部署时，常因学习动态随时间演变而出现不稳定、收敛慢或适应脆弱的问题。传统方法主要适应梯度统计，但忽略了误差信号本身的时间结构，导致性能受限。

Result: 在标准平滑性假设下，为所有案例建立了有界有效更新和稳定性保证。代表性诊断示例表明，所提出的信号能够根据时序差分误差结构调节自适应过程。

Conclusion: 该工作将误差演化提升为自适应学习中的首要对象，提供了一个可解释、轻量级的框架，为动态环境下的可靠学习奠定基础。

Abstract: Learning systems deployed in nonstationary and safety-critical environments often suffer from instability, slow convergence, or brittle adaptation when learning dynamics evolve over time. While modern optimization, reinforcement learning, and meta-learning methods adapt to gradient statistics, they largely ignore the temporal structure of the error signal itself. This paper proposes a diagnostic-driven adaptive learning framework that explicitly models error evolution through a principled decomposition into bias, capturing persistent drift; noise, capturing stochastic variability; and alignment, capturing repeated directional excitation leading to overshoot. These diagnostics are computed online from lightweight statistics of loss or temporal-difference error trajectories and are independent of model architecture or task domain. We show that the proposed bias-noise-alignment decomposition provides a unifying control backbone for supervised optimization, actor-critic reinforcement learning, and learned optimizers. Building on this framework, we derive diagnostic-driven instantiations including a stabilized supervised optimizer, a diagnostic-regulated actor-critic scheme, and a diagnostic-conditioned learned optimizer. Under standard smoothness assumptions, we establish bounded effective updates and stability properties for all cases. Representative diagnostic illustrations in actor-critic learning highlight how the proposed signals modulate adaptation in response to temporal-difference error structure. Overall, this work elevates error evolution to a first-class object in adaptive learning and provides an interpretable, lightweight foundation for reliable learning in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Transformers, while powerful, suffer from quadratic computational complexity and the ever-growing Key-Value (KV) cache of the attention mechanism. This paper introduces Trellis, a novel Transformer architecture with bounded memory that learns how to compress its key-value memory dynamically at test time. Trellis replaces the standard KV cache with a fixed-size memory and train a two-pass recurrent compression mechanism to store new keys and values into memory. To achieve this, it leverages an online gradient descent procedure with a forget gate, enabling the compressed memory to be updated recursively while learning to retain important contextual information from incoming tokens at test time. Extensive experiments on language modeling, common-sense reasoning, recall-intensive tasks, and time series show that the proposed architecture outperforms strong baselines. Notably, its performance gains increase as the sequence length grows, highlighting its potential for long-context applications.

Abstract: Neural processes (NPs) are a class of models that learn stochastic processes directly from data and can be used for inference, sampling and conditional sampling. We introduce a new NP model based on flow matching, a generative modeling paradigm that has demonstrated strong performance on various data modalities. Following the NP training framework, the model provides amortized predictions of conditional distributions over any arbitrary points in the data. Compared to previous NP models, our model is simple to implement and can be used to sample from conditional distributions using an ODE solver, without requiring auxiliary conditioning methods. In addition, the model provides a controllable tradeoff between accuracy and running time via the number of steps in the ODE solver. We show that our model outperforms previous state-of-the-art neural process methods on various benchmarks including synthetic 1D Gaussian processes data, 2D images, and real-world weather data.

Motivation: 在无模型强化学习中实现可证明的稳定性具有挑战性，尤其是在平衡探索与严格安全性方面。现有方法依赖复杂的奖励工程，需要更系统的方法来保证稳定性。

Method: 通过多步数据学习李雅普诺夫证书，引入指数稳定性标签（ESL）和λ加权聚合机制来平衡偏差-方差权衡。使用稳定性感知的优势函数指导策略优化，确保策略能促进李雅普诺夫快速下降。

Result: 在六个基准测试中（包括稳定性和非线性跟踪任务），MSACL优于最先进的基于李雅普诺夫的RL算法。该框架在简单奖励下实现指数稳定性和快速收敛，并对不确定性具有鲁棒性，能泛化到未见过的轨迹。

Conclusion: 通过将李雅普诺夫理论与离线演员-评论家框架结合，MSACL为可验证的安全学习控制提供了基础。多步范围n=20被确定为跨不同系统的稳健默认值。

Abstract: Achieving provable stability in model-free reinforcement learning (RL) remains a challenge, particularly in balancing exploration with rigorous safety. This article introduces MSACL, a framework that integrates exponential stability theory with maximum entropy RL through multi-step Lyapunov certificate learning. Unlike methods relying on complex reward engineering, MSACL utilizes off-policy multi-step data to learn Lyapunov certificates satisfying theoretical stability conditions. By introducing Exponential Stability Labels (ESL) and a $λ$-weighted aggregation mechanism, the framework effectively balances the bias-variance trade-off in multi-step learning. Policy optimization is guided by a stability-aware advantage function, ensuring the learned policy promotes rapid Lyapunov descent. We evaluate MSACL across six benchmarks, including stabilization and nonlinear tracking tasks, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art Lyapunov-based RL algorithms. MSACL achieves exponential stability and rapid convergence under simple rewards, while exhibiting significant robustness to uncertainties and generalization to unseen trajectories. Sensitivity analysis establishes the multi-step horizon $n=20$ as a robust default across diverse systems. By linking Lyapunov theory with off-policy actor-critic frameworks, MSACL provides a foundation for verifiably safe learning-based control. Source code and benchmark environments will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Speculative decoding improves LLM inference by generating and verifying multiple tokens in parallel, but existing systems suffer from suboptimal performance due to a mismatch between dynamic speculation and static runtime assumptions. We present Yggdrasil, a co-designed system that enables latency-optimal speculative decoding through context-aware tree drafting and compiler-friendly execution. Yggdrasil introduces an equal-growth tree structure for static graph compatibility, a latency-aware optimization objective for draft selection, and stage-based scheduling to reduce overhead. Yggdrasil supports unmodified LLMs and achieves up to $3.98\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art baselines across multiple hardware setups.

Abstract: This study investigates small-scale pretraining for Small Language Models (SLMs) to enable efficient use of limited data and compute, improve accessibility in low-resource settings and reduce costs. To enhance long-context extrapolation in compact models, we focus on Infini-attention, which builds a compressed memory from past segments while preserving local attention. In our work, we conduct an empirical study using 300M-parameter LLaMA models pretrained with Infini-attention. The model demonstrates training stability and outperforms the baseline in long-context retrieval. We identify the balance factor as a key part of the model performance, and we found that retrieval accuracy drops with repeated memory compressions over long sequences. Even so, Infini-attention still effectively compensates for the SLM's limited parameters. Particularly, despite performance degradation at a 16,384-token context, the Infini-attention model achieves up to 31% higher accuracy than the baseline. Our findings suggest that achieving robust long-context capability in SLMs benefits from architectural memory like Infini-attention.

Abstract: Soft actor-critic (SAC) is a popular algorithm for max-entropy reinforcement learning. In practice, the energy-based policies in SAC are often approximated using simple policy classes for efficiency, sacrificing the expressiveness and robustness. In this paper, we propose a variant of the SAC algorithm that parameterizes the policy with flow-based models, leveraging their rich expressiveness. In the algorithm, we evaluate the flow-based policy utilizing the instantaneous change-of-variable technique and update the policy with an online variant of flow matching developed in this paper. This online variant, termed importance sampling flow matching (ISFM), enables policy update with only samples from a user-specified sampling distribution rather than the unknown target distribution. We develop a theoretical analysis of ISFM, characterizing how different choices of sampling distributions affect the learning efficiency. Finally, we conduct a case study of our algorithm on the max-entropy linear quadratic regulator problems, demonstrating that the proposed algorithm learns the optimal action distribution.

Abstract: Machine learning has achieved remarkable success across a wide range of applications, yet many of its most effective methods rely on access to large amounts of labeled data or extensive online interaction. In practice, acquiring high-quality labels and making decisions through trial-and-error can be expensive, time-consuming, or risky, particularly in large-scale or high-stakes settings. This dissertation studies interactive machine learning, in which the learner actively influences how information is collected or which actions are taken, using past observations to guide future interactions. We develop new algorithmic principles and establish fundamental limits for interactive learning along three dimensions: active learning with noisy data and rich model classes, sequential decision making with large action spaces, and model selection under partial feedback. Our results include the first computationally efficient active learning algorithms achieving exponential label savings without low-noise assumptions; the first efficient, general-purpose contextual bandit algorithms whose guarantees are independent of the size of the action space; and the first tight characterizations of the fundamental cost of model selection in sequential decision making. Overall, this dissertation advances the theoretical foundations of interactive learning by developing algorithms that are statistically optimal and computationally efficient, while also providing principled guidance for deploying interactive learning methods in large-scale, real-world settings.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了针对类别不平衡多分类问题的两种先进的替代损失函数族：广义对数调整损失和广义类别感知加权损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 类别平衡损失通过平等对待所有类别来保证公平性，但直接优化难以处理。需要设计有效的替代损失函数来处理类别不平衡问题，并为它们提供理论保证。

Method: 提出了两种损失函数族：1）广义对数调整损失：将对数调整损失推广到广义交叉熵损失族；2）广义类别感知加权损失：扩展标准类别加权损失，加入类别依赖的置信度边界，并扩展到广义交叉熵家族。

Result: 理论上，GLA损失在完整假设集下是贝叶斯一致的，但其H一致性边界与最小类别概率成反比；GCA损失在任意有界或完整假设集下都保持H一致性，边界与最小类别概率的平方根成反比，提供更强的理论保证。实验表明，这两种损失在类别不平衡设置中均能显著优于简单的类别加权损失和对数调整损失。

Conclusion: GCA损失在高度不平衡设置中表现稍优，GLA损失在常见基准测试中表现稍好。两种损失都能有效处理类别不平衡问题，GCA损失提供更强的理论保证，尤其是在极不平衡场景下。

Abstract: The balanced loss is a widely adopted objective for multi-class classification under class imbalance. By assigning equal importance to all classes, regardless of their frequency, it promotes fairness and ensures that minority classes are not overlooked. However, directly minimizing the balanced classification loss is typically intractable, which makes the design of effective surrogate losses a central question. This paper introduces and studies two advanced surrogate loss families: Generalized Logit-Adjusted (GLA) loss functions and Generalized Class-Aware weighted (GCA) losses. GLA losses generalize Logit-Adjusted losses, which shift logits based on class priors, to the broader general cross-entropy loss family. GCA loss functions extend the standard class-weighted losses, which scale losses inversely by class frequency, by incorporating class-dependent confidence margins and extending them to the general cross-entropy family. We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of consistency for both loss families. We show that GLA losses are Bayes-consistent, but only $H$-consistent for complete (i.e., unbounded) hypothesis sets. Moreover, their $H$-consistency bounds depend inversely on the minimum class probability, scaling at least as $1/\mathsf p_{\min}$. In contrast, GCA losses are $H$-consistent for any hypothesis set that is bounded or complete, with $H$-consistency bounds that scale more favorably as $1/\sqrt{\mathsf p_{\min}}$, offering significantly stronger theoretical guarantees in imbalanced settings. We report the results of experiments demonstrating that, empirically, both the GCA losses with calibrated class-dependent confidence margins and GLA losses can greatly outperform straightforward class-weighted losses as well as the LA losses. GLA generally performs slightly better in common benchmarks, whereas GCA exhibits a slight edge in highly imbalanced settings.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and their quantized counterparts are vulnerable to extraction attacks, posing a significant threat of IP theft. Yet, the robustness of quantized models against these attacks is little studied compared to large models. Previous defenses propose to inject calculated noise into the prediction probabilities. However, these defenses are limited since they are not incorporated during the model design and are only added as an afterthought after training. Additionally, most defense techniques are computationally expensive and often have unrealistic assumptions about the victim model that are not feasible in edge device implementations and do not apply to quantized models. In this paper, we propose DivQAT, a novel algorithm to train quantized CNNs based on Quantization Aware Training (QAT) aiming to enhance their robustness against extraction attacks. To the best of our knowledge, our technique is the first to modify the quantization process to integrate a model extraction defense into the training process. Through empirical validation on benchmark vision datasets, we demonstrate the efficacy of our technique in defending against model extraction attacks without compromising model accuracy. Furthermore, combining our quantization technique with other defense mechanisms improves their effectiveness compared to traditional QAT.

Abstract: Flood models inform strategic disaster management by simulating the spatiotemporal hydrodynamics of flooding. While physics-based numerical flood models are accurate, their substantial computational cost limits their use in operational settings where rapid predictions are essential. Models designed with graph neural networks (GNNs) provide both speed and accuracy while having the ability to process unstructured spatial domains. Given its flexible input and architecture, GNNs can be leveraged alongside physics-informed techniques with ease, significantly improving interpretability. This study introduces a novel flood GNN architecture, DUALFloodGNN, which embeds physical constraints at both global and local scales through explicit loss terms. The model jointly predicts water volume at nodes and flow along edges through a shared message-passing framework. To improve performance for autoregressive inference, model training is conducted with a multi-step loss enhanced with dynamic curriculum learning. Compared with standard GNN architectures and state-of-the-art GNN flood models, DUALFloodGNN achieves substantial improvements in predicting multiple hydrologic variables while maintaining high computational efficiency. The model is open-sourced at https://github.com/acostacos/dual_flood_gnn.

Motivation: 为了解决传统数据科学工作流在处理无界时间序列数据时，从批量原型到流式生产系统转换需要大量重实现代码，并导致因果性违反、批次边界伪影和实时故障难以复现的问题。

Method: 采用基于有向无环图(DAG)的统一执行模型，具有点级幂等性保证：任意时间t的输出仅依赖于t之前的固定长度上下文窗口。该框架自动追踪所有转换中的知识时间，强化严格因果性，并支持跨时间和特征维度的灵活分块处理。

Result: DataFlow框架实现了批量模式下开发的模型无需代码修改即可在流式生产环境中完全一致地执行，消除了未来数据窥视漏洞。支持金融交易、物联网、欺诈检测和实时分析等多个领域的应用。

Conclusion: DataFlow通过统一batch和streaming执行模型，解决了传统机器学习工作流在处理时间序列数据时的主要挑战，为高性能机器学习系统的构建、测试和部署提供了有效框架。

Abstract: We present DataFlow, a computational framework for building, testing, and deploying high-performance machine learning systems on unbounded time-series data. Traditional data science workflows assume finite datasets and require substantial reimplementation when moving from batch prototypes to streaming production systems. This gap introduces causality violations, batch boundary artifacts, and poor reproducibility of real-time failures.
  DataFlow resolves these issues through a unified execution model based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) with point-in-time idempotency: outputs at any time t depend only on a fixed-length context window preceding t. This guarantee ensures that models developed in batch mode execute identically in streaming production without code changes. The framework enforces strict causality by automatically tracking knowledge time across all transformations, eliminating future-peeking bugs.
  DataFlow supports flexible tiling across temporal and feature dimensions, allowing the same model to operate at different frequencies and memory profiles via configuration alone. It integrates natively with the Python data science stack and provides fit/predict semantics for online learning, caching and incremental computation, and automatic parallelization through DAG-based scheduling. We demonstrate its effectiveness across domains including financial trading, IoT, fraud detection, and real-time analytics.

Motivation: 生成式AI正从对话助手转向自主决策系统，这带来了自主性悖论：系统自主性越高，就需要更多形式化结构、显式约束和尾部风险控制。随机生成模型在操作领域可能很脆弱，需要可验证的可行性、分布偏移鲁棒性和高后果场景压力测试机制。

Method: 开发了基于运筹学的保障自治概念框架，包含两大互补方法：1）基于流的生成模型将生成视为确定性传输，通过常微分方程表征，实现可审计性、约束感知生成，并连接最优传输、鲁棒优化和序列决策控制；2）通过对抗鲁棒性视角制定操作安全性：在不确定性或模糊集内评估决策规则对最坏情况扰动的鲁棒性，将未建模风险纳入设计。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is shifting from conversational assistants toward agentic systems -- autonomous decision-making systems that sense, decide, and act within operational workflows. This shift creates an autonomy paradox: as GenAI systems are granted greater operational autonomy, they should, by design, embody more formal structure, more explicit constraints, and stronger tail-risk discipline. We argue stochastic generative models can be fragile in operational domains unless paired with mechanisms that provide verifiable feasibility, robustness to distribution shift, and stress testing under high-consequence scenarios. To address this challenge, we develop a conceptual framework for assured autonomy grounded in operations research (OR), built on two complementary approaches. First, flow-based generative models frame generation as deterministic transport characterized by an ordinary differential equation, enabling auditability, constraint-aware generation, and connections to optimal transport, robust optimization, and sequential decision control. Second, operational safety is formulated through an adversarial robustness lens: decision rules are evaluated against worst-case perturbations within uncertainty or ambiguity sets, making unmodeled risks part of the design. This framework clarifies how increasing autonomy shifts OR's role from solver to guardrail to system architect, with responsibility for control logic, incentive protocols, monitoring regimes, and safety boundaries. These elements define a research agenda for assured autonomy in safety-critical, reliability-sensitive operational domains.

TL;DR: 本文提出了熵秩保持度量（ERPM），这是一种基于邻域矩阵奇异值谱的香农熵和稳定秩的局部度量，旨在从信息理论角度量化低维嵌入的质量，弥补传统距离或几何评估指标的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的嵌入评估指标（如应力、基于秩的邻域准则或局部Procrustes）主要量化距离或局部几何的失真，但无法直接评估从高维数据投影到低维空间时信息保留的程度。本文旨在从信息论角度直接衡量嵌入过程中的信息损失。

Method: 引入熵秩保持度量（ERPM），该度量基于邻域矩阵奇异值谱的香农熵和稳定秩，通过比较原始表示与其降维投影之间的不确定性变化，提供邻域级指标和全局汇总统计。使用金融时间序列和文献中常用的流形数据集，将ERPM与基于距离的均相对秩误差（MRRE）和基于几何的局部Procrustes进行比较验证。

Result: 基于距离的准则与几何和谱度量之间的相关性非常低；ERPM与局部Procrustes表现出较强的平均相关性，但在局部区域存在显著差异。ERPM能够识别信息损失严重的邻域，从而对嵌入进行更全面的评估。

Conclusion: ERPM通过识别信息损失严重的邻域，补充了现有的评估指标，使得对嵌入的评估更加全面，尤其在信息敏感的应用（如早期预警指标构建）中具有重要价值。

Abstract: In this work we study the quality of low-dimensional embeddings from an explicitly information-theoretic perspective. We begin by noting that classical evaluation metrics such as stress, rank-based neighborhood criteria, or Local Procrustes quantify distortions in distances or in local geometries, but do not directly assess how much information is preserved when projecting high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional space. To address this limitation, we introduce the Entropy Rank Preservation Measure (ERPM), a local metric based on the Shannon entropy of the singular-value spectrum of neighborhood matrices and on the stable rank, which quantifies changes in uncertainty between the original representation and its reduced projection, providing neighborhood-level indicators and a global summary statistic. To validate the results of the metric, we compare its outcomes with the Mean Relative Rank Error (MRRE), which is distance-based, and with Local Procrustes, which is based on geometric properties, using a financial time series and a manifold commonly studied in the literature. We observe that distance-based criteria exhibit very low correlation with geometric and spectral measures, while ERPM and Local Procrustes show strong average correlation but display significant discrepancies in local regimes, leading to the conclusion that ERPM complements existing metrics by identifying neighborhoods with severe information loss, thereby enabling a more comprehensive assessment of embeddings, particularly in information-sensitive applications such as the construction of early-warning indicators.

Conclusion: CLEAR-HUG通过两阶段框架成功解决了心电图自监督学习中的关键限制，能够捕获跨导联的细微传导变异，同时遵循临床诊断流程，显著提高了心电图分析的性能。

Abstract: The multi-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) stands as a cornerstone of cardiac diagnosis. Recent strides in electrocardiogram self-supervised learning (eSSL) have brightened prospects for enhancing representation learning without relying on high-quality annotations. Yet earlier eSSL methods suffer a key limitation: they focus on consistent patterns across leads and beats, overlooking the inherent differences in heartbeats rooted in cardiac conduction processes, while subtle but significant variations carry unique physiological signatures. Moreover, representation learning for ECG analysis should align with ECG diagnostic guidelines, which progress from individual heartbeats to single leads and ultimately to lead combinations. This sequential logic, however, is often neglected when applying pre-trained models to downstream tasks. To address these gaps, we propose CLEAR-HUG, a two-stage framework designed to capture subtle variations in cardiac conduction across leads while adhering to ECG diagnostic guidelines. In the first stage, we introduce an eSSL model termed Conduction-LEAd Reconstructor (CLEAR), which captures both specific variations and general commonalities across heartbeats. Treating each heartbeat as a distinct entity, CLEAR employs a simple yet effective sparse attention mechanism to reconstruct signals without interference from other heartbeats. In the second stage, we implement a Hierarchical lead-Unified Group head (HUG) for disease diagnosis, mirroring clinical workflow. Experimental results across six tasks show a 6.84% improvement, validating the effectiveness of CLEAR-HUG. This highlights its ability to enhance representations of cardiac conduction and align patterns with expert diagnostic guidelines.

Motivation: 现有图表征学习方法依赖替代对比目标或互信息最大化，通常需要复杂架构、负采样策略和敏感的超参数调优，可能导致过平滑、过挤压和训练不稳定问题。

Method: 提出HyperGRL框架，在单位超球面上嵌入节点，通过两个对抗性耦合目标：邻居均值对齐和无采样均匀性。对齐目标使用节点局部邻域的均值表示构建语义基础稳定的目标；均匀性目标通过基于L2的超球面正则化实现分散。还引入熵引导的自适应平衡机制动态调节对齐与均匀性的相互作用。

Result: 在节点分类、节点聚类和链接预测任务上的广泛实验表明，HyperGRL在不同图结构上提供了优越的表征质量和泛化能力，分别比现有最强方法平均提高了1.49%、0.86%和0.74%。

Conclusion: 基于几何基础的、无需采样的对比目标在图表征学习中具有有效性，为克服现有方法的局限性提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph representation learning (GRL) aims to encode structural and semantic dependencies of graph-structured data into low-dimensional embeddings. However, existing GRL methods often rely on surrogate contrastive objectives or mutual information maximization, which typically demand complex architectures, negative sampling strategies, and sensitive hyperparameter tuning. These design choices may induce over-smoothing, over-squashing, and training instability. In this work, we propose HyperGRL, a unified framework for hyperspherical graph representation learning via adaptive neighbor-mean alignment and sampling-free uniformity. HyperGRL embeds nodes on a unit hypersphere through two adversarially coupled objectives: neighbor-mean alignment and sampling-free uniformity. The alignment objective uses the mean representation of each node's local neighborhood to construct semantically grounded, stable targets that capture shared structural and feature patterns. The uniformity objective formulates dispersion via an L2-based hyperspherical regularization, encouraging globally uniform embedding distributions while preserving discriminative information. To further stabilize training, we introduce an entropy-guided adaptive balancing mechanism that dynamically regulates the interplay between alignment and uniformity without requiring manual tuning. Extensive experiments on node classification, node clustering, and link prediction demonstrate that HyperGRL delivers superior representation quality and generalization across diverse graph structures, achieving average improvements of 1.49%, 0.86%, and 0.74% over the strongest existing methods, respectively. These findings highlight the effectiveness of geometrically grounded, sampling-free contrastive objectives for graph representation learning.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) display strikingly different generalization behaviors: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often narrows capability, whereas reinforcement-learning (RL) tuning tends to preserve it. The reasons behind this divergence remain unclear, as prior studies have largely relied on coarse accuracy metrics. We address this gap by introducing a novel benchmark that decomposes reasoning into atomic core skills such as calculation, fact retrieval, simulation, enumeration, and diagnostic, providing a concrete framework for addressing the fundamental question of what constitutes reasoning in LLMs. By isolating and measuring these core skills, the benchmark offers a more granular view of how specific cognitive abilities emerge, transfer, and sometimes collapse during post-training. Combined with analyses of low-level statistical patterns such as distributional divergence and parameter statistics, it enables a fine-grained study of how generalization evolves under SFT and RL across mathematical, scientific reasoning, and non-reasoning tasks. Our meta-probing framework tracks model behavior at different training stages and reveals that RL-tuned models maintain more stable behavioral profiles and resist collapse in reasoning skills, whereas SFT models exhibit sharper drift and overfit to surface patterns. This work provides new insights into the nature of reasoning in LLMs and points toward principles for designing training strategies that foster broad, robust generalization.

Abstract: Lane-change intention prediction is safety-critical for autonomous driving and ADAS, but remains difficult in naturalistic traffic due to noisy kinematics, severe class imbalance, and limited generalization across heterogeneous highway scenarios. We propose Temporal Physics-Informed AI (TPI-AI), a hybrid framework that fuses deep temporal representations with physics-inspired interaction cues. A two-layer bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) encoder learns compact embeddings from multi-step trajectory histories; we concatenate these embeddings with kinematics-, safety-, and interaction-aware features (e.g., headway, TTC, and safe-gap indicators) and train a LightGBM classifier for three-class intention recognition (No-LC, Left-LC, Right-LC). To improve minority-class reliability, we apply imbalance-aware optimization including resampling/weighting and fold-wise threshold calibration. Experiments on two large-scale drone-based datasets, highD (straight highways) and exiD (ramp-rich environments), use location-based splits and evaluate prediction horizons T = 1, 2, 3 s. TPI-AI outperforms standalone LightGBM and Bi-LSTM baselines, achieving macro-F1 of 0.9562, 0.9124, 0.8345 on highD and 0.9247, 0.8197, 0.7605 on exiD at T = 1, 2, 3 s, respectively. These results show that combining physics-informed interaction features with learned temporal embeddings yields robust multi-scenario lane-change intention prediction.

Abstract: This paper provides an ablation-based analysis of latent autoregression in GP-VAE models, building upon our previous work introducing the architecture. Language models typically rely on an autoregressive factorization over tokens. In contrast, our prior work proposed shifting sequential structure to the latent space through a causal Gaussian process, while using a non-autoregressive decoder. Here, we conduct a systematic ablation study of the role played by latent autoregression. We compare (i) a full GP-VAE model with autoregressive latent dynamics, (ii) a non-autoregressive ablation in which latent variables are independent, and (iii) a standard token-level autoregressive Transformer. Our results show that, within the considered regime (medium-scale corpora and short training contexts), latent autoregression induces latent trajectories that are significantly more compatible with the Gaussian-process prior and exhibit greater long-horizon stability. In contrast, removing autoregression leads to degraded latent structure and unstable long-range behavior. These findings highlight the role of latent autoregression as an effective mechanism for organizing long-range structure, while remaining complementary to token-level autoregressive modeling. They should be interpreted as an empirical analysis of representational structure rather than as a proposal for a new architecture.

Abstract: We demonstrate an approach for LLMs to critique their \emph{own} answers with the goal of enhancing their performance that leads to significant improvements over established planning benchmarks. Despite the findings of earlier research that has cast doubt on the effectiveness of LLMs leveraging self critique methods, we show significant performance gains on planning datasets in the Blocksworld domain through intrinsic self-critique, without external source such as a verifier. We also demonstrate similar improvements on Logistics and Mini-grid datasets, exceeding strong baseline accuracies. We employ a few-shot learning technique and progressively extend it to a many-shot approach as our base method and demonstrate that it is possible to gain substantial improvement on top of this already competitive approach by employing an iterative process for correction and refinement. We illustrate how self-critique can significantly boost planning performance. Our empirical results present new state-of-the-art on the class of models considered, namely LLM model checkpoints from October 2024. Our primary focus lies on the method itself, demonstrating intrinsic self-improvement capabilities that are applicable regardless of the specific model version, and we believe that applying our method to more complex search techniques and more capable models will lead to even better performance.

Abstract: The presence of outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs) weights and activations makes them difficult to quantize. Recent work has leveraged rotations to mitigate these outliers. In this work, we propose methods that learn fusible rotations by minimizing principled and cheap proxy objectives to the weight quantization error. We primarily focus on GPTQ as the quantization method. Our main method is OptRot, which reduces weight outliers simply by minimizing the element-wise fourth power of the rotated weights. We show that OptRot outperforms both Hadamard rotations and more expensive, data-dependent methods like SpinQuant and OSTQuant for weight quantization. It also improves activation quantization in the W4A8 setting. We also propose a data-dependent method, OptRot$^{+}$, that further improves performance by incorporating information on the activation covariance. In the W4A4 setting, we see that both OptRot and OptRot$^{+}$ perform worse, highlighting a trade-off between weight and activation quantization.

Abstract: Fine-tuning diffusion models via online reinforcement learning (RL) has shown great potential for enhancing text-to-image alignment. However, since precisely specifying a ground-truth objective for visual tasks remains challenging, the models are often optimized using a proxy reward that only partially captures the true goal. This mismatch often leads to reward hacking, where proxy scores increase while real image quality deteriorates and generation diversity collapses. While common solutions add regularization against the reference policy to prevent reward hacking, they compromise sample efficiency and impede the exploration of novel, high-reward regions, as the reference policy is usually sub-optimal. To address the competing demands of sample efficiency, effective exploration, and mitigation of reward hacking, we propose Gated and Adaptive Regularization with Diversity-aware Optimization (GARDO), a versatile framework compatible with various RL algorithms. Our key insight is that regularization need not be applied universally; instead, it is highly effective to selectively penalize a subset of samples that exhibit high uncertainty. To address the exploration challenge, GARDO introduces an adaptive regularization mechanism wherein the reference model is periodically updated to match the capabilities of the online policy, ensuring a relevant regularization target. To address the mode collapse issue in RL, GARDO amplifies the rewards for high-quality samples that also exhibit high diversity, encouraging mode coverage without destabilizing the optimization process. Extensive experiments across diverse proxy rewards and hold-out unseen metrics consistently show that GARDO mitigates reward hacking and enhances generation diversity without sacrificing sample efficiency or exploration, highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.

Conclusion: 配对种子评估提供了一种简单有效的评估方法，可在固定计算预算下获得更紧的置信区间、更高的统计功效和有效的样本量增益，提升机器学习系统比较评估的统计质量

Abstract: Machine learning systems appear stochastic but are deterministically random, as seeded pseudorandom number generators produce identical realisations across executions. Learning-based simulators are widely used to compare algorithms, design choices, and interventions under such dynamics, yet evaluation outcomes often exhibit high variance due to random initialisation and learning stochasticity. We analyse the statistical structure of comparative evaluation in these settings and show that standard independent evaluation designs fail to exploit shared sources of randomness across alternatives. We formalise a paired seed evaluation design in which competing systems are evaluated under identical random seeds, inducing matched realisations of stochastic components and strict variance reduction whenever outcomes are positively correlated at the seed level. This yields tighter confidence intervals, higher statistical power, and effective sample size gains at fixed computational budgets. Empirically, seed-level correlations are typically large and positive, producing order-of-magnitude efficiency gains. Paired seed evaluation is weakly dominant in practice, improving statistical reliability when correlation is present and reducing to independent evaluation without loss of validity when it is not.

Abstract: Plasma kinetic equations exhibit pronounced sensitivity to microscopic perturbations in model parameters and data, making reliable and efficient uncertainty quantification (UQ) essential for predictive simulations. However, the cost of uncertainty sampling, the high-dimensional phase space, and multiscale stiffness pose severe challenges to both computational efficiency and error control in traditional numerical methods. These aspects are further emphasized in presence of collisions where the high-dimensional nonlocal collision integrations and conservation properties pose severe constraints. To overcome this, we present a variance-reduced Monte Carlo framework for UQ in the Vlasov--Poisson--Landau (VPL) system, in which neural network surrogates replace the multiple costly evaluations of the Landau collision term. The method couples a high-fidelity, asymptotic-preserving VPL solver with inexpensive, strongly correlated surrogates based on the Vlasov--Poisson--Fokker--Planck (VPFP) and Euler--Poisson (EP) equations. For the surrogate models, we introduce a generalization of the separable physics-informed neural network (SPINN), developing a class of tensor neural networks based on an anisotropic micro-macro decomposition, to reduce velocity-moment costs, model complexity, and the curse of dimensionality. To further increase correlation with VPL, we calibrate the VPFP model and design an asymptotic-preserving SPINN whose small- and large-Knudsen limits recover the EP and VP systems, respectively. Numerical experiments show substantial variance reduction over standard Monte Carlo, accurate statistics with far fewer high-fidelity samples, and lower wall-clock time, while maintaining robustness to stochastic dimension.

Abstract: Sepsis, characterized by a dysregulated immune response to infection, results in significant mortality, morbidity, and healthcare costs. The timely prediction of sepsis progression is crucial for reducing adverse outcomes through early intervention. Despite the development of numerous models for Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients, there remains a notable gap in approaches for the early detection of sepsis in non-ward settings. This research introduces and evaluates four novel machine learning algorithms designed for predicting the onset of sepsis on wearable devices by analyzing heart rate data. The architecture of these models was refined through a genetic algorithm, optimizing for performance, computational complexity, and memory requirements. Performance metrics were subsequently extracted for each model to evaluate their feasibility for implementation on wearable devices capable of accurate heart rate monitoring. The models were initially tailored for a prediction window of one hour, later extended to four hours through transfer learning. The encouraging outcomes of this study suggest the potential for wearable technology to facilitate early sepsis detection outside ICU and ward environments.

Motivation: 当前多模态波束预测方法大多采用固定或经验权重，假设各模态始终同等可靠，而实际UAV运动场景中不同模态的重要性变化剧烈；静态加权会放大退化模态的负面影响，且模态失配和对齐弱进一步削弱跨场景泛化能力。

Method: 提出了SaM2B框架：1）利用环境视觉、飞行姿态和地理空间等轻量线索，通过可靠性感知的动态权重更新机制，自适应分配不同时间点上各模态的贡献；2）采用跨模态对比学习，将多源表示波束语义对齐到共享语义空间，提升在模态噪声和分布偏移下的判别力与鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SaM2B通过动态权重分配和语义对齐有效解决了多模态波束预测中的模态可靠性波动和泛化问题，为低空经济中UAV可靠通信提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: The low-altitude economy (LAE) is rapidly expanding driven by urban air mobility, logistics drones, and aerial sensing, while fast and accurate beam prediction in uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) communications is crucial for achieving reliable connectivity. Current research is shifting from single-signal to multi-modal collaborative approaches. However, existing multi-modal methods mostly employ fixed or empirical weights, assuming equal reliability across modalities at any given moment. Indeed, the importance of different modalities fluctuates dramatically with UAV motion scenarios, and static weighting amplifies the negative impact of degraded modalities. Furthermore, modal mismatch and weak alignment further undermine cross-scenario generalization. To this end, we propose a reliability-aware dynamic weighting scheme applied to a semantic-aware multi-modal beam prediction framework, named SaM2B. Specifically, SaM2B leverages lightweight cues such as environmental visual, flight posture, and geospatial data to adaptively allocate contributions across modalities at different time points through reliability-aware dynamic weight updates. Moreover, by utilizing cross-modal contrastive learning, we align the "multi-source representation beam semantics" associated with specific beam information to a shared semantic space, thereby enhancing discriminative power and robustness under modal noise and distribution shifts. Experiments on real-world low-altitude UAV datasets show that SaM2B achieves more satisfactory results than baseline methods.

Abstract: Laplace approximations are among the simplest and most practical methods for approximate Bayesian inference in neural networks, yet their Euclidean formulation struggles with the highly anisotropic, curved loss surfaces and large symmetry groups that characterize modern deep models. Recent work has proposed Riemannian and geometric Gaussian approximations to adapt to this structure. Building on these ideas, we introduce the Tubular Riemannian Laplace (TRL) approximation. TRL explicitly models the posterior as a probabilistic tube that follows a low-loss valley induced by functional symmetries, using a Fisher/Gauss-Newton metric to separate prior-dominated tangential uncertainty from data-dominated transverse uncertainty. We interpret TRL as a scalable reparametrised Gaussian approximation that utilizes implicit curvature estimates to operate in high-dimensional parameter spaces. Our empirical evaluation on ResNet-18 (CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100) demonstrates that TRL achieves excellent calibration, matching or exceeding the reliability of Deep Ensembles (in terms of ECE) while requiring only a fraction (1/5) of the training cost. TRL effectively bridges the gap between single-model efficiency and ensemble-grade reliability.

Abstract: Multimodal intelligence development recently show strong progress in visual understanding and high level reasoning. Though, most reasoning system still reply on textual information as the main medium for inference. This limit their effectiveness in spatial tasks such as visual navigation and geo-localization. This work discuss about the potential scope of this field and eventually propose an idea visual reasoning paradigm Geo-Consistent Visual Planning, our introduced framework called Visual Reasoning for Localization, or ViReLoc, which performs planning and localization using only visual representations. The proposed framework learns spatial dependencies and geometric relations that text based reasoning often suffer to understand. By encoding step by step inference in the visual domain and optimizing with reinforcement based objectives, ViReLoc plans routes between two given ground images. The system also integrates contrastive learning and adaptive feature interaction to align cross view perspectives and reduce viewpoint differences. Experiments across diverse navigation and localization scenarios show consistent improvements in spatial reasoning accuracy and cross view retrieval performance. These results establish visual reasoning as a strong complementary approach for navigation and localization, and show that such tasks can be performed without real time global positioning system data, leading to more secure navigation solutions.

Abstract: Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) and dynamic discrete choice (DDC) models explain sequential decision-making by recovering reward functions that rationalize observed behavior. Flexible IRL methods typically rely on machine learning but provide no guarantees for valid inference, while classical DDC approaches impose restrictive parametric specifications and often require repeated dynamic programming. We develop a semiparametric framework for debiased inverse reinforcement learning that yields statistically efficient inference for a broad class of reward-dependent functionals in maximum entropy IRL and Gumbel-shock DDC models. We show that the log-behavior policy acts as a pseudo-reward that point-identifies policy value differences and, under a simple normalization, the reward itself. We then formalize these targets, including policy values under known and counterfactual softmax policies and functionals of the normalized reward, as smooth functionals of the behavior policy and transition kernel, establish pathwise differentiability, and derive their efficient influence functions. Building on this characterization, we construct automatic debiased machine-learning estimators that allow flexible nonparametric estimation of nuisance components while achieving $\sqrt{n}$-consistency, asymptotic normality, and semiparametric efficiency. Our framework extends classical inference for DDC models to nonparametric rewards and modern machine-learning tools, providing a unified and computationally tractable approach to statistical inference in IRL.

Abstract: High-dimensional learning problems, where the number of features exceeds the sample size, often require sparse regularization for effective prediction and variable selection. While established for fully supervised data, these techniques remain underexplored in weak-supervision settings such as Positive-Confidence (Pconf) classification. Pconf learning utilizes only positive samples equipped with confidence scores, thereby avoiding the need for negative data. However, existing Pconf methods are ill-suited for high-dimensional regimes. This paper proposes a novel sparse-penalization framework for high-dimensional Pconf classification. We introduce estimators using convex (Lasso) and non-convex (SCAD, MCP) penalties to address shrinkage bias and improve feature recovery. Theoretically, we establish estimation and prediction error bounds for the L1-regularized Pconf estimator, proving it achieves near minimax-optimal sparse recovery rates under Restricted Strong Convexity condition. To solve the resulting composite objective, we develop an efficient proximal gradient algorithm. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve predictive performance and variable selection accuracy comparable to fully supervised approaches, effectively bridging the gap between weak supervision and high-dimensional statistics.

Abstract: Chaotic dynamical systems exhibit strong sensitivity to initial conditions and often contain unresolved multiscale processes, making deterministic forecasting fundamentally limited. Generative models offer an appealing alternative by learning distributions over plausible system evolutions; yet, most existing approaches focus on next-step conditional prediction rather than the structure of the underlying dynamics. In this work, we reframe forecasting as a fully generative problem by learning the joint probability distribution of lagged system states over short temporal windows and obtaining forecasts through marginalization. This new perspective allows the model to capture nonlinear temporal dependencies, represent multistep trajectory segments, and produce next-step predictions consistent with the learned joint distribution. We also introduce a general, model-agnostic training and inference framework for joint generative forecasting and show how it enables assessment of forecast robustness and reliability using three complementary uncertainty quantification metrics (ensemble variance, short-horizon autocorrelation, and cumulative Wasserstein drift), without access to ground truth. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method on two canonical chaotic dynamical systems, the Lorenz-63 system and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, and show that joint generative models yield improved short-term predictive skill, preserve attractor geometry, and achieve substantially more accurate long-range statistical behaviour than conventional conditional next-step models.

Abstract: Causal discovery from observational data remains fundamentally limited by identifiability constraints. Recent work has explored leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) as sources of prior causal knowledge, but existing approaches rely on heuristic integration that lacks theoretical grounding. We introduce HOLOGRAPH, a framework that formalizes LLM-guided causal discovery through sheaf theory--representing local causal beliefs as sections of a presheaf over variable subsets. Our key insight is that coherent global causal structure corresponds to the existence of a global section, while topological obstructions manifest as non-vanishing sheaf cohomology. We propose the Algebraic Latent Projection to handle hidden confounders and Natural Gradient Descent on the belief manifold for principled optimization. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that HOLOGRAPH provides rigorous mathematical foundations while achieving competitive performance on causal discovery tasks with 50-100 variables. Our sheaf-theoretic analysis reveals that while Identity, Transitivity, and Gluing axioms are satisfied to numerical precision (<10^{-6}), the Locality axiom fails for larger graphs, suggesting fundamental non-local coupling in latent variable projections.

TL;DR: 该论文针对LLM极低位量化中的双二进制分解方法提出改进方案——多包络双二进制分解，通过增强幅度表达能力来解决原方法性能饱和问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统双二进制分解方法在LLM极低位量化中具有部署友好的优势，但其缩放参数过于受限，所有分量共享相同的幅度配置，导致模型性能出现饱和。

Method: 提出多包络双二进制分解方法，保留共享的1bit符号基，但将单一包络替换为秩-l包络。该方法通过共享符号矩阵并在包络分量间分配有限内存预算来增强幅度表达能力，同时采用了闭式初始化和交替优化算法。

Conclusion: 多包络双二进制分解方法有效解决了传统双二进制分解的性能饱和问题，为LLM的极低位量化提供了更优的解决方案，兼顾了推理效率和模型精度。

Abstract: For extreme low-bit quantization of large language models (LLMs), Double Binary Factorization (DBF) is attractive as it enables efficient inference without sacrificing accuracy. However, the scaling parameters of DBF are too restrictive; after factoring out signs, all rank components share the same magnitude profile, resulting in performance saturation. We propose Multi-envelope DBF (MDBF), which retains a shared pair of 1-bit sign bases but replaces the single envelope with a rank-$l$ envelope. By sharing sign matrices among envelope components, MDBF effectively maintains a binary carrier and utilizes the limited memory budget for magnitude expressiveness. We also introduce a closed-form initialization and an alternating refinement method to optimize MDBF. Across the LLaMA and Qwen families, MDBF enhances perplexity and zero-shot accuracy over previous binary formats at matched bits per weight while preserving the same deployment-friendly inference primitive.

Abstract: Generating humorous memes is a challenging multimodal task that moves beyond direct image-to-caption supervision. It requires a nuanced reasoning over visual content, contextual cues, and subjective humor. To bridge this gap between visual perception and humorous punchline creation, we propose HUMOR}, a novel framework that guides VLMs through hierarchical reasoning and aligns them with group-wise human preferences. First, HUMOR employs a hierarchical, multi-path Chain-of-Thought (CoT): the model begins by identifying a template-level intent, then explores diverse reasoning paths under different contexts, and finally anchors onto a high-quality, context-specific path. This CoT supervision, which traces back from ground-truth captions, enhances reasoning diversity. We further analyze that this multi-path exploration with anchoring maintains a high expected humor quality, under the practical condition that high-quality paths retain significant probability mass. Second, to capture subjective humor, we train a pairwise reward model that operates within groups of memes sharing the same template. Following established theory, this approach ensures a consistent and robust proxy for human preference, even with subjective and noisy labels. The reward model then enables a group-wise reinforcement learning optimization, guaranteeing providing a theoretical guarantee for monotonic improvement within the trust region. Extensive experiments show that HUMOR empowers various VLMs with superior reasoning diversity, more reliable preference alignment, and higher overall meme quality. Beyond memes, our work presents a general training paradigm for open-ended, human-aligned multimodal generation, where success is guided by comparative judgment within coherent output group.

### [170] [CPR: Causal Physiological Representation Learning for Robust ECG Analysis under Distribution Shifts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24564)
*Shunbo Jia,Caizhi Liao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 为解决心电图AI诊断面对平滑对抗扰动（SAP）攻击的脆弱性以及现有防御方法在计算效率与实时性方面的困境，本文提出一种基于因果解缠的心电图生理表示学习方法，该方法能在保证实时推理效率的同时，提供与传统认证鲁棒方法相当的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前心电图AI诊断模型对模仿真实生物形态的平滑对抗扰动（SAP）非常脆弱。现有防御方法存在显著缺陷：对抗训练（AT）计算负担过大，而随机平滑认证方法则引入严重的延迟，无法满足实时临床监控的需求。作者认为这种脆弱性源于模型过度依赖非鲁棒的伪相关，而非不变的病理特征。

Method: 提出因果生理表示学习（CPR）。该方法不同于仅进行去噪操作的常规方法，而是将生理结构先验整合到一个因果解缠框架中。通过结构因果模型来建模心电图生成过程，施加一种结构性干预，以严格分离不变的病理形态特征（如P-QRS-T波群）与非因果伪影。

Result: 在PTB-XL数据集上的实验表明，CPR显著优于标准的临床预处理方法。在对抗性攻击下，CPR的F1分数达到0.632，比中值平滑方法高出9.1%。重要的是，CPR在保证与随机平滑方法相当的认证鲁棒性的同时，保持了单次前向推理的效率，在鲁棒性、效率和临床可解释性之间取得了更优的平衡。

Conclusion: CPR (Causal Physiological Representation Learning) 是一种有效应对心电图诊断模型鲁棒性挑战的新方法。它通过引入因果解缠框架和结构干预，成功地将模型中依赖的特征从非鲁棒的虚假相关转移到不变的病理形态特征上，从而在不牺牲推理效率的前提下，显著提升了模型在对抗攻击下的可靠性与安全性。这为构建高效、可信赖、适用于实时临床环境的心电图AI诊断系统提供了一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: Deep learning models for Electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis have achieved remarkable accuracy but exhibit fragility against adversarial perturbations, particularly Smooth Adversarial Perturbations (SAP) that mimic biological morphology. Existing defenses face a critical dilemma: Adversarial Training (AT) provides robustness but incurs a prohibitive computational burden, while certified methods like Randomized Smoothing (RS) introduce significant inference latency, rendering them impractical for real-time clinical monitoring. We posit that this vulnerability stems from the models' reliance on non-robust spurious correlations rather than invariant pathological features. To address this, we propose Causal Physiological Representation Learning (CPR). Unlike standard denoising approaches that operate without semantic constraints, CPR incorporates a Physiological Structural Prior within a causal disentanglement framework. By modeling ECG generation via a Structural Causal Model (SCM), CPR enforces a structural intervention that strictly separates invariant pathological morphology (P-QRS-T complex) from non-causal artifacts. Empirical results on PTB-XL demonstrate that CPR significantly outperforms standard clinical preprocessing methods. Specifically, under SAP attacks, CPR achieves an F1 score of 0.632, surpassing Median Smoothing (0.541 F1) by 9.1%. Crucially, CPR matches the certified robustness of Randomized Smoothing while maintaining single-pass inference efficiency, offering a superior trade-off between robustness, efficiency, and clinical interpretability.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) apply uniform computation to all tokens, despite language exhibiting highly non-uniform information density. This token-uniform regime wastes capacity on locally predictable spans while under-allocating computation to semantically critical transitions. We propose $\textbf{Dynamic Large Concept Models (DLCM)}$, a hierarchical language modeling framework that learns semantic boundaries from latent representations and shifts computation from tokens to a compressed concept space where reasoning is more efficient. DLCM discovers variable-length concepts end-to-end without relying on predefined linguistic units. Hierarchical compression fundamentally changes scaling behavior. We introduce the first $\textbf{compression-aware scaling law}$, which disentangles token-level capacity, concept-level reasoning capacity, and compression ratio, enabling principled compute allocation under fixed FLOPs. To stably train this heterogeneous architecture, we further develop a $\textbf{decoupled $μ$P parametrization}$ that supports zero-shot hyperparameter transfer across widths and compression regimes. At a practical setting ($R=4$, corresponding to an average of four tokens per concept), DLCM reallocates roughly one-third of inference compute into a higher-capacity reasoning backbone, achieving a $\textbf{+2.69$\%$ average improvement}$ across 12 zero-shot benchmarks under matched inference FLOPs.

Abstract: Accurate traffic prediction is essential for Intelligent Transportation Systems, including ride-hailing, urban road planning, and vehicle fleet management. However, due to significant privacy concerns surrounding traffic data, most existing methods rely on local training, resulting in data silos and limited knowledge sharing. Federated Learning (FL) offers an efficient solution through privacy-preserving collaborative training; however, standard FL struggles with the non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) problem among clients. This challenge has led to the emergence of Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) as a promising paradigm. Nevertheless, current PFL frameworks require further adaptation for traffic prediction tasks, such as specialized graph feature engineering, data processing, and network architecture design. A notable limitation of many prior studies is their reliance on hyper-parameter optimization across datasets-information that is often unavailable in real-world scenarios-thus impeding practical deployment. To address this challenge, we propose AutoFed, a novel PFL framework for traffic prediction that eliminates the need for manual hyper-parameter tuning. Inspired by prompt learning, AutoFed introduces a federated representor that employs a client-aligned adapter to distill local data into a compact, globally shared prompt matrix. This prompt then conditions a personalized predictor, allowing each client to benefit from cross-client knowledge while maintaining local specificity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that AutoFed consistently achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) have achieved strong performance in many real-world applications, yet targeted backdoor poisoning on heterogeneous graphs remains less studied. We consider backdoor attacks for heterogeneous node classification, where an adversary injects a small set of trigger nodes and connections during training to force specific victim nodes to be misclassified into an attacker-chosen label at test time while preserving clean performance. We propose HeteroHBA, a generative backdoor framework that selects influential auxiliary neighbors for trigger attachment via saliency-based screening and synthesizes diverse trigger features and connection patterns to better match the local heterogeneous context. To improve stealthiness, we combine Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) with a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss to align the trigger feature distribution with benign statistics, thereby reducing detectability, and we optimize the attack with a bilevel objective that jointly promotes attack success and maintains clean accuracy. Experiments on multiple real-world heterogeneous graphs with representative HGNN architectures show that HeteroHBA consistently achieves higher attack success than prior backdoor baselines with comparable or smaller impact on clean accuracy; moreover, the attack remains effective under our heterogeneity-aware structural defense, CSD. These results highlight practical backdoor risks in heterogeneous graph learning and motivate the development of stronger defenses.

Abstract: Despite the recent progresses, particularly in developing Language Models, there are fundamental challenges and unanswered questions about how such models can continually learn/memorize, self-improve, and find effective solutions. In this paper, we present a new learning paradigm, called Nested Learning (NL), that coherently represents a machine learning model with a set of nested, multi-level, and/or parallel optimization problems, each of which with its own context flow. Through the lenses of NL, existing deep learning methods learns from data through compressing their own context flow, and in-context learning naturally emerges in large models. NL suggests a philosophy to design more expressive learning algorithms with more levels, resulting in higher-order in-context learning and potentially unlocking effective continual learning capabilities. We advocate for NL by presenting three core contributions: (1) Expressive Optimizers: We show that known gradient-based optimizers, such as Adam, SGD with Momentum, etc., are in fact associative memory modules that aim to compress the gradients' information (by gradient descent). Building on this insight, we present other more expressive optimizers with deep memory and/or more powerful learning rules; (2) Self-Modifying Learning Module: Taking advantage of NL's insights on learning algorithms, we present a sequence model that learns how to modify itself by learning its own update algorithm; and (3) Continuum Memory System: We present a new formulation for memory system that generalizes the traditional viewpoint of long/short-term memory. Combining our self-modifying sequence model with the continuum memory system, we present a continual learning module, called Hope, showing promising results in language modeling, knowledge incorporation, and few-shot generalization tasks, continual learning, and long-context reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 提出DCL-DECOR方法解决混合潜在混杂（既有广泛影响多个变量的全局混杂，也有仅影响小范围变量的局部混杂）下的因果发现问题，通过先去除全局混杂，再处理局部混杂的方式恢复因果图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际应用中的观测数据常受到混合潜在混杂的影响，现有方法存在局限性：可微分DAG学习方法会将全局混杂效应误判为因果边，而潜在变量图模型只能恢复无向结构。

Method: 提出DCL-DECOR模块化精度主导流水线：1）通过精度矩阵分解分离普遍混杂效应，得到处理全局混杂后的结构化分量；2）使用相关噪声DAG学习方法在该去混杂表示上恢复有向边，同时建模剩余结构化误差相关性；3）进行简单调和步骤确保无弓形结构。

Result: 提供了混合混杂下可识别因果目标的理论分析，将整体问题简化为具有模块化保证的已研究子问题。合成实验显示，在变化全局混杂强度和维度的情况下，该方法比直接在混杂数据上应用相关噪声DAG学习在定向边恢复上具有一致改进。

Conclusion: DCL-DECOR方法能有效处理混合潜在混杂，通过分阶段处理全局和局部混杂，在合成实验中展现了优于现有方法的因果发现性能。

Abstract: We study causal discovery from observational data in linear Gaussian systems affected by \emph{mixed latent confounding}, where some unobserved factors act broadly across many variables while others influence only small subsets. This setting is common in practice and poses a challenge for existing methods: differentiable and score-based DAG learners can misinterpret global latent effects as causal edges, while latent-variable graphical models recover only undirected structure.
  We propose \textsc{DCL-DECOR}, a modular, precision-led pipeline that separates these roles. The method first isolates pervasive latent effects by decomposing the observed precision matrix into a structured component and a low-rank component. The structured component corresponds to the conditional distribution after accounting for pervasive confounders and retains only local dependence induced by the causal graph and localized confounding. A correlated-noise DAG learner is then applied to this deconfounded representation to recover directed edges while modeling remaining structured error correlations, followed by a simple reconciliation step to enforce bow-freeness.
  We provide identifiability results that characterize the recoverable causal target under mixed confounding and show how the overall problem reduces to well-studied subproblems with modular guarantees. Synthetic experiments that vary the strength and dimensionality of pervasive confounding demonstrate consistent improvements in directed edge recovery over applying correlated-noise DAG learning directly to the confounded data.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of language processing tasks. However, this success comes at the cost of substantial computation and memory requirements, which significantly impedes their deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address this challenge, this work introduces an automation framework that leverages weight pruning and low-bit quantization, and presents a hardware-software co-design method that generates accelerators on the Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) platform. In particular, we implement a unified pipeline that applies N:M structured pruning and 4-bit integer quantization to reduce the memory footprint, followed by optimized dequantization and matrix multiplication to enhance LLM inference on several hardware platforms, including CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs with Dense and 2:4 Sparse Tensor Cores, and a custom systolic-array-based FPGA accelerator. Utilizing 2:4 sparsity combined with quantization on $4096 \times 4096$ matrices, our approach achieves a reduction of up to $4\times$ in weight storage and a $1.71\times$ speedup in matrix multiplication, yielding a $1.29\times$ end-to-end latency reduction compared to dense GPU baselines. Scaling analysis on the LLaMA-7B model further shows that structured sparsity enhances the throughput per token by $1.36\times$. These results demonstrate the synergy of fine-grained N:M sparsity and quantization for enabling efficient and deployable LLM inference, while the proposed FPGA accelerator offers a flexible architectural path for supporting a broader class of sparsity patterns beyond the fixed 2:4 hardware constraints.

Abstract: Autonomous taxi services represent a transformative advancement in urban mobility, offering safety, efficiency, and round-the-clock operations. While existing literature has explored user acceptance of autonomous taxis through stated preference experiments and hypothetical scenarios, few studies have investigated actual user behavior based on operational AV services. This study addresses that gap by leveraging survey data from Wuhan, China, where Baidu's Apollo Robotaxi service operates at scale. We design a realistic survey incorporating actual service attributes and collect 336 valid responses from actual users. Using Structural Equation Modeling, we identify six latent psychological constructs, namely Trust \& Policy Support, Cost Sensitivity, Performance, Behavioral Intention, Lifestyle, and Education. Their influences on adoption behavior, measured by the selection frequency of autonomous taxis in ten scenarios, are examined and interpreted. Results show that Cost Sensitivity and Behavioral Intention are the strongest positive predictors of adoption, while other latent constructs play more nuanced roles. The model demonstrates strong goodness-of-fit across multiple indices. Our findings offer empirical evidence to support policymaking, fare design, and public outreach strategies for scaling autonomous taxis deployments in real-world urban settings.

Abstract: Neural networks trained with standard objectives exhibit behaviors characteristic of probabilistic inference: soft clustering, prototype specialization, and Bayesian uncertainty tracking. These phenomena appear across architectures -- in attention mechanisms, classification heads, and energy-based models -- yet existing explanations rely on loose analogies to mixture models or post-hoc architectural interpretation. We provide a direct derivation. For any objective with log-sum-exp structure over distances or energies, the gradient with respect to each distance is exactly the negative posterior responsibility of the corresponding component: $\partial L / \partial d_j = -r_j$. This is an algebraic identity, not an approximation. The immediate consequence is that gradient descent on such objectives performs expectation-maximization implicitly -- responsibilities are not auxiliary variables to be computed but gradients to be applied. No explicit inference algorithm is required because inference is embedded in optimization. This result unifies three regimes of learning under a single mechanism: unsupervised mixture modeling, where responsibilities are fully latent; attention, where responsibilities are conditioned on queries; and cross-entropy classification, where supervision clamps responsibilities to targets. The Bayesian structure recently observed in trained transformers is not an emergent property but a necessary consequence of the objective geometry. Optimization and inference are the same process.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS), which automates the architectural design process of deep neural networks (DNN), has attracted increasing attention. Multimodal DNNs that necessitate feature fusion from multiple modalities benefit from NAS due to their structural complexity; however, constructing an architecture for multimodal DNNs through NAS requires a substantial amount of labeled training data. Thus, this paper proposes a self-supervised learning (SSL) method for architecture search of multimodal DNNs. The proposed method applies SSL comprehensively for both the architecture search and model pretraining processes. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method successfully designed architectures for DNNs from unlabeled training data.

Abstract: Precise probabilistic information about drug-target interaction (DTI) predictions is vital for understanding limitations and boosting predictive performance. Gaussian processes (GP) offer a scalable framework to integrate state-of-the-art DTI representations and Bayesian inference, enabling novel operations, such as Bayesian classification with rejection, top-$K$ selection, and ranking. We propose a deep kernel learning-based GP architecture (DTI-GP), which incorporates a combined neural embedding module for chemical compounds and protein targets, and a GP module. The workflow continues with sampling from the predictive distribution to estimate a Bayesian precedence matrix, which is used in fast and accurate selection and ranking operations. DTI-GP outperforms state-of-the-art solutions, and it allows (1) the construction of a Bayesian accuracy-confidence enrichment score, (2) rejection schemes for improved enrichment, and (3) estimation and search for top-$K$ selections and ranking with high expected utility.

TL;DR: 本文分析了乐观乘法权重更新（OMWU）在Nash学习人类反馈（NLHF）中的收敛行为，提供了首次收敛性保证，显示出在支持完整的纳什均衡存在时的最后迭代线性收敛性，比先前研究放宽了纳什均衡唯一性的要求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好建模方法（如Bradley-Terry模型）假设传递性，忽视了人类群体偏好的复杂性。虽然NLHF通过博弈论方法处理非传递性偏好，但现有算法通常依赖正则化，导致在原博弈中对偶间隙存在不可避免的偏差。

Method: 研究分析了乐观乘法权重更新（OMWU）算法在NLHF框架中的应用，将其视为两人零和博弈问题。通过理论分析证明了OMWU的收敛特性，特别关注了支持完整的纳什均衡存在时的收敛行为。

Result: 证明了OMWU在经历一个预热阶段后，当存在支持完整的纳什均衡时，能够实现最后迭代线性收敛，并且收敛到原始纳什均衡的线性收敛率取决于具体实例条件。更重要的是，该结果不要求纳什均衡的唯一性假设。

Conclusion: OMWU算法在NLHF中展现出优异的收敛特性，特别是在放宽均衡唯一性要求的情况下，仍能实现强收敛保证。实验验证了该算法在表格策略和神经策略类中的有效性，显示其在大型语言模型对齐应用中的潜力。

Abstract: Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences has proven effective for enhancing model capabilities, yet standard preference modeling using the Bradley-Terry model assumes transitivity, overlooking the inherent complexity of human population preferences. Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF) addresses this by framing non-transitive preferences as a two-player zero-sum game, where alignment reduces to finding the Nash equilibrium (NE). However, existing algorithms typically rely on regularization, incurring unavoidable bias when computing the duality gap in the original game. In this work, we provide the first convergence guarantee for Optimistic Multiplicative Weights Update ($\mathtt{OMWU}$) in NLHF, showing that it achieves last-iterate linear convergence after a burn-in phase whenever an NE with full support exists, with an instance-dependent linear convergence rate to the original NE, measured by duality gaps. Compared to prior results in Wei et al. (2020), we do not require the assumption of NE uniqueness. Our analysis identifies a novel marginal convergence behavior, where the probability of rarely played actions grows exponentially from exponentially small values, enabling exponentially better dependence on instance-dependent constants than prior results. Experiments corroborate the theoretical strengths of $\mathtt{OMWU}$ in both tabular and neural policy classes, demonstrating its potential for LLM applications.

Abstract: Temporally extended actions improve the ability to explore and plan in single-agent settings. In multi-agent settings, the exponential growth of the joint state space with the number of agents makes coordinated behaviours even more valuable. Yet, this same exponential growth renders the design of multi-agent options particularly challenging. Existing multi-agent option discovery methods often sacrifice coordination by producing loosely coupled or fully independent behaviours. Toward addressing these limitations, we describe a novel approach for multi-agent option discovery. Specifically, we propose a joint-state abstraction that compresses the state space while preserving the information necessary to discover strongly coordinated behaviours. Our approach builds on the inductive bias that synchronisation over agent states provides a natural foundation for coordination in the absence of explicit objectives. We first approximate a fictitious state of maximal alignment with the team, the \textit{Fermat} state, and use it to define a measure of \textit{spreadness}, capturing team-level misalignment on each individual state dimension. Building on this representation, we then employ a neural graph Laplacian estimator to derive options that capture state synchronisation patterns between agents. We evaluate the resulting options across multiple scenarios in two multi-agent domains, showing that they yield stronger downstream coordination capabilities compared to alternative option discovery methods.

Abstract: High-quality reconstruction of Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) fields is critical for Atmosphere monitoring, yet current models remain constrained by the scarcity of complete training data and a lack of uncertainty quantification.To address these limitations, we propose AODDiff, a probabilistic reconstruction framework based on diffusion-based Bayesian inference. By leveraging the learned spatiotemporal probability distribution of the AOD field as a generative prior, this framework can be flexibly adapted to various reconstruction tasks without requiring task-specific retraining. We first introduce a corruption-aware training strategy to learns a spatiotemporal AOD prior solely from naturally incomplete data. Subsequently, we employ a decoupled annealing posterior sampling strategy that enables the more effective and integration of heterogeneous observations as constraints to guide the generation process. We validate the proposed framework through extensive experiments on Reanalysis data. Results across downscaling and inpainting tasks confirm the efficacy and robustness of AODDiff, specifically demonstrating its advantage in maintaining high spatial spectral fidelity. Furthermore, as a generative model, AODDiff inherently enables uncertainty quantification via multiple sampling, offering critical confidence metrics for downstream applications.

Abstract: Transfer effects manifest themselves both during training using a fixed data set and in inductive inference using accumulating data. We hypothesize that perturbing the data set by including more samples, instead of perturbing the model by gradient updates, provides a complementary and more fundamental characterization of transfer effects. To capture this phenomenon, we quantitatively model transfer effects using multi-task learning curves approximating the inductive performance over varying sample sizes. We describe an efficient method to approximate multi-task learning curves analogous to the Task Affinity Grouping method applied during training. We compare the statistical and computational approaches to transfer, which indicates considerably higher compute costs for the previous but better power and broader applicability. Evaluations are performed using a benchmark drug-target interaction data set. Our results show that learning curves can better capture the effects of multi-task learning and their multi-task extensions can delineate pairwise and contextual transfer effects in foundation models.

Abstract: Cognitive task classification using machine learning plays a central role in decoding brain states from neuroimaging data. By integrating machine learning with brain network analysis, complex connectivity patterns can be extracted from functional magnetic resonance imaging connectomes. This process transforms raw blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals into interpretable representations of cognitive processes. Graph neural networks (GNNs) further advance this paradigm by modeling brain regions as nodes and functional connections as edges, capturing topological dependencies and multi-scale interactions that are often missed by conventional approaches. Our proposed SpectralBrainGNN model, a spectral convolution framework based on graph Fourier transforms (GFT) computed via normalized Laplacian eigendecomposition. Experiments on the Human Connectome Project-Task (HCPTask) dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, achieving a classification accuracy of 96.25\%. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/gnnplayground/SpectralBrainGNN to support reproducibility and future research.

Abstract: Persistent homology (PH) has recently emerged as a powerful tool for extracting topological features. Integrating PH into machine learning and deep learning models enhances topology awareness and interpretability. However, most PH methods on graphs rely on a limited set of filtrations, such as degree-based or weight-based filtrations, which overlook richer features like recurring information across the dataset and thus restrict expressive power. In this work, we propose a novel graph filtration called Frequent Subgraph Filtration (FSF), which is derived from frequent subgraphs and produces stable and information-rich frequency-based persistent homology (FPH) features. We study the theoretical properties of FSF and provide both proofs and experimental validation. Beyond persistent homology itself, we introduce two approaches for graph classification: an FPH-based machine learning model (FPH-ML) and a hybrid framework that integrates FPH with graph neural networks (FPH-GNNs) to enhance topology-aware graph representation learning. Our frameworks bridge frequent subgraph mining and topological data analysis, offering a new perspective on topology-aware feature extraction. Experimental results show that FPH-ML achieves competitive or superior accuracy compared with kernel-based and degree-based filtration methods. When integrated into graph neural networks, FPH yields relative performance gains ranging from 0.4 to 21 percent, with improvements of up to 8.2 percentage points over GCN and GIN backbones across benchmarks.

Motivation: 传统稀疏自编码器（SAE）学习的特征存在冗余，且在不同训练运行和稀疏度水平下变化较大，导致特征解释难以转移和重用

Method: 提出蒸馏Matryoshka稀疏自编码器（DMSAEs）训练流程：1）训练带共享核心的Matryoshka SAE；2）使用梯度激活归因评估特征对下一token损失的贡献；3）保留能解释固定比例归因的最小特征子集；4）仅转移核心编码器权重向量，每轮重置核心解码器和非核心隐变量

Conclusion: DMSAEs能够提取出跨稀疏度水平可转移的稳定特征集，提升稀疏自编码器的特征可解释性和重用性

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) aim to disentangle model activations into monosemantic, human-interpretable features. In practice, learned features are often redundant and vary across training runs and sparsity levels, which makes interpretations difficult to transfer and reuse. We introduce Distilled Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders (DMSAEs), a training pipeline that distills a compact core of consistently useful features and reuses it to train new SAEs. DMSAEs run an iterative distillation cycle: train a Matryoshka SAE with a shared core, use gradient X activation to measure each feature's contribution to next-token loss in the most nested reconstruction, and keep only the smallest subset that explains a fixed fraction of the attribution. Only the core encoder weight vectors are transferred across cycles; the core decoder and all non-core latents are reinitialized each time. On Gemma-2-2B layer 12 residual stream activations, seven cycles of distillation (500M tokens, 65k width) yielded a distilled core of 197 features that were repeatedly selected. Training using this distilled core improves several SAEBench metrics and demonstrates that consistent sets of latent features can be transferred across sparsity levels

Conclusion: 该研究证明了基于梯度余弦相似度的方法可以有效预测任务的数据效率，仅需少量标注样本，大大减少了微调过程中的标注成本，为LLMs的高效微调提供了实用工具。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate reasonable zero-shot capability across many downstream tasks, fine-tuning is a common practice to improve their performance. However, a task's data efficiency--i.e., the number of fine-tuning examples needed to achieve a desired level of performance--is often unknown, resulting in costly cycles of incremental annotation and retraining. Indeed, we demonstrate across a curated set of 30 specialized tasks that performant LLMs may struggle zero-shot but can attain stronger performance after fine-tuning. This motivates the need for methods to predict a task's data efficiency without requiring incremental annotation. After introducing a concrete metric that quantifies a task's data efficiency, we propose using the gradient cosine similarity of low-confidence examples to predict data efficiency based on a small number of labeled samples. We validate our approach on a diverse set of tasks with varying data efficiencies, attaining 8.6% error in overall data efficiency prediction and typically eliminating hundreds of unnecessary annotations on each task. Our experiment results and implementation code are available on GitHub.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive models for faster inference via parallel token generation. We provide a rigorous foundation for this advantage by formalizing a model of parallel sampling and showing that DLMs augmented with polynomial-length chain-of-thought (CoT) can simulate any parallel sampling algorithm using an optimal number of sequential steps. Consequently, whenever a target distribution can be generated using a small number of sequential steps, a DLM can be used to generate the distribution using the same number of optimal sequential steps. However, without the ability to modify previously revealed tokens, DLMs with CoT can still incur large intermediate footprints. We prove that enabling remasking (converting unmasked tokens to masks) or revision (converting unmasked tokens to other unmasked tokens) together with CoT further allows DLMs to simulate any parallel sampling algorithm with optimal space complexity. We further justify the advantage of revision by establishing a strict expressivity gap: DLMs with revision or remasking are strictly more expressive than those without. Our results not only provide a theoretical justification for the promise of DLMs as the most efficient parallel sampler, but also advocate for enabling revision in DLMs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Binary choices, as often used for reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), convey only the direction of a preference. A person may choose apples over oranges and bananas over grapes, but which preference is stronger? Strength is crucial for decision-making under uncertainty and generalization of preference models, but hard to measure reliably. Metadata such as response times and inter-annotator agreement can serve as proxies for strength, but are often noisy and confounded. We propose ResponseRank to address the challenge of learning from noisy strength signals. Our method uses relative differences in proxy signals to rank responses to pairwise comparisons by their inferred preference strength. To control for systemic variation, we compare signals only locally within carefully constructed strata. This enables robust learning of utility differences consistent with strength-derived rankings while making minimal assumptions about the strength signal. Our contributions are threefold: (1) ResponseRank, a novel method that robustly learns preference strength by leveraging locally valid relative strength signals; (2) empirical evidence of improved sample efficiency and robustness across diverse tasks: synthetic preference learning (with simulated response times), language modeling (with annotator agreement), and RL control tasks (with simulated episode returns); and (3) the Pearson Distance Correlation (PDC), a novel metric that isolates cardinal utility learning from ordinal accuracy.

Method: 使用基于类别条件的生成模型（扩散模型和自回归模型）构建生成式分类器，不需要专门的数据增强、强正则化、额外超参数或先验知识

Result: 在五个标准的图像和文本分布漂移基准测试中达到最先进性能，在医学和卫星数据集等实际应用中有效减少了虚假相关性的影响

Conclusion: 生成式分类器通过建模所有特征来避免过度依赖虚假相关性，在存在分布漂移的情况下表现优于判别式分类器，并通过高斯玩具模型分析揭示了其归纳偏置和适用条件

Abstract: Discriminative approaches to classification often learn shortcuts that hold in-distribution but fail even under minor distribution shift. This failure mode stems from an overreliance on features that are spuriously correlated with the label. We show that generative classifiers, which use class-conditional generative models, can avoid this issue by modeling all features, both core and spurious, instead of mainly spurious ones. These generative classifiers are simple to train, avoiding the need for specialized augmentations, strong regularization, extra hyperparameters, or knowledge of the specific spurious correlations to avoid. We find that diffusion-based and autoregressive generative classifiers achieve state-of-the-art performance on five standard image and text distribution shift benchmarks and reduce the impact of spurious correlations in realistic applications, such as medical or satellite datasets. Finally, we carefully analyze a Gaussian toy setting to understand the inductive biases of generative classifiers, as well as the data properties that determine when generative classifiers outperform discriminative ones.

Abstract: Despite their scale and success, modern transformers are almost universally trained as single-minded systems: optimization produces one deterministic set of parameters, representing a single functional hypothesis about the data. Motivated by the idea that intelligence emerge from many minds, we propose Population Bayesian Transformers (B-Trans), which transform a standard Large Language Model into a Bayesian Transformer model to supports sampling diverse yet coherent model instances from a single set of pre-trained weights.
  B-Trans introduces a Bayesian-motivated posterior proxy by treating the bias-like offsets in normalization layers as stochastic variables with a Gaussian variational approximation, inducing a distribution over model behavior without the cost of training full Bayesian neural networks. Sampling from this proxy yields a set of model instances with diverse behaviors while maintaining general competence. To preserve coherence within each generation, we freeze the sampled noise at the sequence level, enforcing temporal consistency across tokens. B-Trans allows for population-level decision-making, where aggregating predictions across sampled individuals significantly enhances exploration. Experiments across zero-shot generation, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), and RL without explicit labels demonstrate that B-Trans effectively leverage the wisdom of crowds, yielding superior semantic diversity while achieving better task performance compared to deterministic baselines.

Abstract: High-stakes decision making involves reasoning under uncertainty about the future. In this work, we train language models to make predictions on open-ended forecasting questions. To scale up training data, we synthesize novel forecasting questions from global events reported in daily news, using a fully automated, careful curation recipe. We train the Qwen3 thinking models on our dataset, OpenForesight. To prevent leakage of future information during training and evaluation, we use an offline news corpus, both for data generation and retrieval in our forecasting system. Guided by a small validation set, we show the benefits of retrieval, and an improved reward function for reinforcement learning (RL). Once we obtain our final forecasting system, we perform held-out testing between May to August 2025. Our specialized model, OpenForecaster 8B, matches much larger proprietary models, with our training improving the accuracy, calibration, and consistency of predictions. We find calibration improvements from forecasting training generalize across popular benchmarks. We open-source all our models, code, and data to make research on language model forecasting broadly accessible.

Abstract: Non-terrestrial base stations (NTBSs), including high-altitude platform stations (HAPSs) and hot-air balloons (HABs), are integral to next-generation wireless networks, offering coverage in remote areas and enhancing capacity in dense regions. In this paper, we propose a distributed beamforming framework for a massive MIMO network with a constellation of aerial platform stations (APSs). Our approach leverages an entropy-based multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model, where each APS operates as an independent agent using imperfect channel state information (CSI) in both training and testing phases. Unlike conventional methods, our model does not require CSI sharing among APSs, significantly reducing overhead. Simulations results demonstrate that our method outperforms zero forcing (ZF) and maximum ratio transmission (MRT) techniques, particularly in high-interference scenarios, while remaining robust to CSI imperfections. Additionally, our framework exhibits scalability, maintaining stable performance over an increasing number of users and various cluster configurations. Therefore, the proposed method holds promise for dynamic and interference-rich NTBS networks, advancing scalable and robust wireless solutions.

Abstract: This paper investigates the economic and technical feasibility of integrating Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology in the Non-Road Mobile Machinery (NRMM) sector. These often-idling assets, with their substantial battery capacities, present a unique opportunity to participate in energy markets, providing grid services and generating additional revenue.

While the focus lies on the methodology, the financial opportunities for the use-case of an electric NRMM rental service will be presented. However, the study is limited by the availability of real-world data on the usage of electric NRMM and does not address regulatory challenges of V2G.

Abstract: DC microgrids provide an efficient framework for the interconnection of DC distributed energy resources (DERs) and DC loads. To continue to supply legacy single-phase AC loads, DC/AC converters can be integrated in the DC microgrid. The oscillatory instantaneous power of the single-phase AC load translates into a harmonic current on the converter's DC side, which increases the losses and causes unwanted voltage harmonics in the DC microgrid. To mitigate this issue, this paper proposes a hybrid voltage and current control method (HCM) for DERs. This scheme consists of an inner current control loop and an outer control layer which determines the reference for the inner loop. The outer control layer combines the DC voltage control loop with an output harmonic current control loop. This hybrid structure enables simultaneous regulation of the DC components of the DER output voltage and control of the harmonic component of the DER output current in accordance with the local single-phase AC load's demand. Frequency-domain analysis of the proposed method is presented to demonstrate the DC voltage and harmonic current loops are decoupled and there is no unwanted interaction between them. Additionally, time-domain response of the proposed scheme is validated through hardware-in-the-loop test results.

Motivation: 传统间歇性操作在能量缓冲期间让传感器休眠，导致系统错过瞬时关键事件（如非法盗猎、森林火灾），这在资源受限的电池供电节点中造成严重的'可用性缺口'。

Conclusion: 该算法为在资源受限节点上构建弹性、故障安全的监控系统奠定了坚实基础，能够有效支持荒野监测等高价值应用场景。

Abstract: Wilderness monitoring tasks, such as poaching surveillance and forest fire detection, require pervasive and high-accuracy sensing. While AIoT offers a promising path, covering vast, inaccessible regions necessitates the massive deployment of maintenance-free, battery-less nodes with limited computational resources. However, these constraints create a critical `Availability Gap.' Conventional intermittent operations prioritize computation throughput, forcing sensors to sleep during energy buffering. Consequently, systems miss ephemeral, `now-or-never' events (e.g., Vocalizations of natural monuments or Fire), which is fatal for detecting rare but high-stakes anomalies. To address this, we propose an Energy-aware Elastic Split Computing Algorithm that prioritizes continuous sensing by dynamically offloading tasks to energy-rich neighbors. Preliminary results demonstrate stable monitoring of an additional $2,496\;\text{m}^2$ and the capture of approximately 103 more critical events per day. Ultimately, this algorithm establishes a robust foundation for building resilient, fail-safe surveillance systems even on resource-constrained nodes.

TL;DR: 该论文展示了动态乘子可用于保证含斜率限制非线性的Lur'e系统具有有界且可量化的功率增益，从而降低系统对噪声的敏感性，前提是其他外生信号具有恒定稳态。对于周期激励，系统可能出现次谐波或混沌响应，但文中重新审视了一类能保证唯一、吸引且保周期解的乘子。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态乘子用于保证含斜率限制非线性的Lur'e系统的稳定性，但不能保证系统具有有限增量增益。论文旨在研究乘子如何保证系统的功率增益有界且可量化，并探讨其在周期激励下的响应特性，以及这类乘子在保证系统性态方面的适用范围和局限性。

Method: 论文采用理论分析方法，首先阐明了乘子可量化闭环比功率增益的性质，指出在合适稳态偏置条件下可测量功率（前提是乘子不要求非线性为奇函数）。然后重新审视了一类能保证周期激励下系统具有唯一、吸引和保周期解的乘子，推导这些乘子时可运用经典工具，并重新考虑了其应用所需假设。

Result: 研究表明，动态乘子可保证Lur'e系统的闭环比功率增益有界且可量化，从而确保系统对噪声具有较低敏感性，但前提是其他外生信号保持恒定稳态。对于周期激励，乘子能保证系统响应具有唯一、吸引和保周期的特性，但其相位限制与离散时间乘子一致；并且，除非圆判据也适用，否则不能在所有频率上使用乘子，这与已知的动态乘子与增量稳定性结论一致。

Conclusion: 动态乘子在保证Lur'e系统性能方面具有明确但有限的应用价值：可用于量化功率增益并抑制噪声敏感性，但对周期激励的系统响应存在局限性；乘子的相位限制与离散时间乘子相似，且在全频域应用需满足圆判据条件，因此其适用范围受动态乘子与增量稳定性间已知关系的限制。

Abstract: Dynamic multipliers can be used to guarantee the stability of Lurye systems with slope-restricted nonlinearities, but give no guarantee that the closed-loop system has finite incremental gain. We show that multipliers guarantee the closed-loop power gain to be bounded and quantifiable. Power may be measured about an appropriate steady state bias term, provided the multiplier does not require the nonlinearity to be odd. Hence dynamic multipliers can be used to guarantee such Lurye systems have low sensitivity to noise, provided other exogenous signals have constant steady state. For periodic excitation, the closed-loop response can apparently have a subharmonic or chaotic response. We revisit a class of multipliers that can guarantee a unique, attractive and period-preserving solution. We show the multipliers can be derived using classical tools and reconsider assumptions required for their application. Their phase limitations are inherited from those of discrete-time multipliers. The multipliers cannot be used at all frequencies unless the circle criterion can also be applied; this is consistent with known results about dynamic multipliers and incremental stability.

Abstract: A systematic method for the design of linear residual generators for combined fault detection and estimation in nonlinear systems is developed. The proposed residual generator is a linear functional observer built for an extended system that incorporates the fault dynamics from a linear exo-system, and in addition possesses disturbance-decoupling properties. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such residual generators for nonlinear systems are derived. As long as these conditions are satisfied, we obtain explicit design formulas for the residual generator. The results are illustrated through a chemical reactor case study, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

Abstract: We study safe control for dynamical systems whose continuous-time dynamics are learned with Gaussian processes (GPs), focusing on mechanical and port-Hamiltonian systems where safety is naturally expressed via energy constraints. The availability of a GP Hamiltonian posterior naturally raises the question of how to systematically exploit this structure to design an energy-aware control barrier function with high-probability safety guarantees. We address this problem by developing a Bayesian-CBF framework and instantiating it with energy-aware Bayesian-CBFs (EB-CBFs) that construct conservative energy-based barriers directly from the Hamiltonian and vector-field posteriors, yielding safety filters that minimally modify a nominal controller while providing probabilistic energy safety guarantees. Numerical simulations on a mass-spring system demonstrate that the proposed EB-CBFs achieve high-probability safety under noisy sampled GP-learned dynamics.

Abstract: Automotive FMCW radars are indispensable to modern ADAS and autonomous-driving systems, but their increasing density has intensified the risk of mutual interference. Existing mitigation techniques, including reactive receiver-side suppression, proactive waveform design, and cooperative scheduling, often face limitations in scalability, reliance on side-channel communication, or degradation of range-Doppler resolution. Building on our earlier work on decentralized Frequency-Domain No-Regret hopping, this paper introduces a unified time-frequency game-theoretic framework that enables radars to adapt across both spectral and temporal resources. We formulate the interference-avoidance problem as a repeated anti-coordination game, in which each radar autonomously updates a mixed strategy over frequency subbands and chirp-level time offsets using regret-minimization dynamics. We show that the proposed Time-Frequency No-Regret Hopping algorithm achieves vanishing external and swap regret, and that the induced empirical play converges to an $\varepsilon$-coarse correlated equilibrium or a correlated equilibrium. Theoretical analysis provides regret bounds in the joint domain, revealing how temporal adaptation implicitly regularizes frequency selection and enhances robustness against asynchronous interference. Numerical experiments with multi-radar scenarios demonstrate substantial improvements in SINR, collision rate, and range-Doppler quality compared with time-frequency random hopping and centralized Nash-based benchmarks.

Abstract: This paper aims to provide an efficient implementation of encrypted linear dynamic controllers that perform recursive multiplications on a Ring-Learning With Errors (Ring-LWE) based cryptosystem. By adopting a system-theoretical approach, we significantly reduce both time and space complexities, particularly the number of homomorphic operations required for recursive multiplications. Rather than encrypting the entire state matrix of a given controller, the state matrix is transformed into its rational canonical form, whose sparse and circulant structure enables that encryption and computation are required only on its nontrivial columns. Furthermore, we propose a novel method to ``pack'' each of the input and the output matrices into a single polynomial, thereby reducing the number of homomorphic operations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed design enables a remarkably fast implementation of encrypted controllers.

Abstract: AI data-center expansion is increasingly constrained by the coupled availability of deliverable electricity and heat-rejection (cooling) capacity. We propose and evaluate an integrated Waste-to-Energy-AI Data Center configuration that treats cooling as a first-class energy service rather than an unavoidable electricity burden. The coupled system is modeled as an input-output 'black box' with transparent boundaries and a standalone benchmark in which mechanical chilling is powered by grid electricity. The central mechanism is energy-grade matching: low-grade WtE thermal output drives absorption cooling to deliver chilled service, thereby displacing baseline cooling electricity. We show that thermoeconomic superiority is governed by three first-order determinants, (i) cooling coverage of IT heat load, (ii) parasitic electricity for transport and auxiliaries, and (iii) distance-driven delivery decay, yielding a break-even corridor beyond which net benefits vanish. Comparative statics characterize sensitivity to IT utilization, feedstock quality (waste LHV and throughput), climate parameterization, and corridor distance. We translate these accounting gains into decision language through a computable prototype for Levelized Cost of Computing (LCOC) and an ESG valuation channel grounded in measurable mechanisms, without re-deriving full lifecycle inventories. The framework provides siting-ready feasibility conditions for WtE-AIDC coupling in urban AI corridors under grid stress.

Abstract: This paper proposes a deterministic distributed algorithm, referred to as PP-ACDC, that achieves exact average consensus over possibly unbalanced directed graphs using only a fixed and a priori specified number of quantization bits. The method integrates Push-Pull (surplus) consensus dynamics with a dynamic quantization framing scheme combining zooming and midpoint shifting, enabling agents to preserve the true global average while progressively refining their quantization precision. We establish a rigorous convergence theory showing that PP-ACDC achieves asymptotic (exact) average consensus on any strongly connected digraph under appropriately chosen quantization parameters. Moreover, we develop a fully distributed and synchronized finite-time termination mechanism, and we provide a formal proof on the detection of $ε$-convergence to the average within a finite number of iterations. Numerical simulations corroborate the theoretical results and demonstrate that PP-ACDC achieves reliable, communication-efficient, and precise average consensus even under very tight bit budgets, underscoring its suitability for large-scale and resource-constrained multi-agent systems operating over directed networks.

Abstract: Predictive maintenance demands accurate anomaly detection and trustable explanations. Although multimodal fusion of sensor time-series and thermal imagery shows promise, we demonstrate that naive fusion strategies can paradoxically degrade performance. This paper introduces a Cascaded Anomaly Detection framework that decouples detection and localization. Stage 1 employs an LSTM-based sensor encoder with temporal attention for high-accuracy detection, while Stage 2 activates a CNN-based thermal encoder for post-detection fault localization. Our results reveal that sensor-only detection outperforms full fusion by 8.3 percentage points (93.08% vs. 84.79% F1-score), challenging the assumption that additional modalities invariably improve performance. We further contribute an explainability pipeline integrating SHAP, temporal/spatial attention, and gate weight analysis. This analysis uncovers a "modality bias" where fusion models assign 65-87% weight to the weaker thermal modality. Validated on a real-world bearing dataset (78,397 samples), our cascaded approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while providing actionable diagnostics for maintenance decision-making.

Abstract: Multi-agent target tracking in the presence of nonlinear dynamics and agent heterogeneity, where state-space dimensions may differ, is a challenging problem that traditional graph Laplacian methods cannot easily address. This work leverages the framework of cellular sheaves, a mathematical generalization of graph theory, to natively model such heterogeneous systems. While existing coordination sheaf frameworks focus on cooperative problems like consensus, this work extends them to the non-cooperative target-tracking problem. The tracking of multiple, unknown targets is formulated as a harmonic extension problem on a cellular sheaf, accommodating nonlinear dynamics and external disturbances for all agents. A decentralized control law is developed using the sheaf Laplacian, and a corresponding Lyapunov-based stability analysis is provided to guarantee tracking error convergence, with results validated by simulation.

Abstract: Off-the-shelf fused filament fabrication 3D printers are widely accessible and convenient, yet they exhibit quality loss at high speeds due to dynamic mis-synchronization between printhead motion and material extrusion systems, notably corner over-extrusion. Existing methods require specialized hardware, extensive calibration, or firmware modifications that are inaccessible to most users. This work presents a practical, end-to-end optimization framework that enhances high-speed printing using only standard 3D printers and a phone camera, without requiring additional complex setup. The method employs a one-shot calibration approach in which two simple printed patterns, captured by a phone camera, enable identification of extrusion dynamics and cornering behavior. The identified systems enable a model-based constrained optimal control strategy that generates optimized G-code, synchronizing motion and extrusion. Experiments show reduced width tracking error, mitigated corner defects, and lower surface roughness, achieving surface quality at 3600 mm/min comparable to conventional printing at 1600 mm/min, effectively doubling production speed while maintaining print quality. This accessible, hardware-minimal approach enables a wide range of fused filament fabrication users to achieve high-quality, high-speed additive manufacturing.

Abstract: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) are one of the most devastating climate change induced hazards. Existing remote monitoring approaches often prioritise maximising spatial coverage to train generalistic models or rely on optical imagery hampered by persistent cloud coverage. This paper presents an end-to-end, automated deep learning pipeline for the targeted monitoring of high-risk Himalayan glacial lakes using time-series Sentinel-1 SAR. We introduce a "temporal-first" training strategy, utilising a U-Net with an EfficientNet-B3 backbone trained on a curated dataset of a cohort of 4 lakes (Tsho Rolpa, Chamlang Tsho, Tilicho and Gokyo Lake). The model achieves an IoU of 0.9130 validating the success and efficacy of the "temporal-first" strategy required for transitioning to Early Warning Systems. Beyond the model, we propose an operational engineering architecture: a Dockerised pipeline that automates data ingestion via the ASF Search API and exposes inference results via a RESTful endpoint. This system shifts the paradigm from static mapping to dynamic and automated early warning, providing a scalable architectural foundation for future development in Early Warning Systems.

Abstract: Digital humanities are significantly transforming how Egyptologists study ancient Egyptian texts. The OCR-PT-CT project proposes a recognition method for hieroglyphs based on images of Coffin Texts (CT) from Adriaan de Buck (1935-1961) and Pyramid Texts (PT) from Middle Kingdom coffins (James Allen, 2006). The system identifies hieroglyphs and transcribes them into Gardiner's codes. A web tool organizes them by spells and witnesses, storing the data in CSV format for integration with the MORTEXVAR dataset, which collects Coffin Texts with metadata, transliterations, and translations for research. Recognition has been addressed in two ways: a Mobilenet neural network trained on 140 hieroglyph classes achieved 93.87 \% accuracy but struggled with underrepresented classes. A novel Deep Metric Learning approach improves flexibility for new or data-limited signs, achieving 97.70 \% accuracy and recognizing more hieroglyphs. Due to its superior performance under class imbalance and adaptability, the final system adopts Deep Metric Learning as the default classifier.

Conclusion: GVC为视频通信开辟了新的可能性，提供了一个有效、高效、可扩展且实用的新范式，通过计算-压缩权衡策略，在极端压缩率下仍能保持感知质量。

Abstract: Whether a video can be compressed at an extreme compression rate as low as 0.01%? To this end, we achieve the compression rate as 0.02% at some cases by introducing Generative Video Compression (GVC), a new framework that redefines the limits of video compression by leveraging modern generative video models to achieve extreme compression rates while preserving a perception-centric, task-oriented communication paradigm, corresponding to Level C of the Shannon-Weaver model. Besides, How we trade computation for compression rate or bandwidth? GVC answers this question by shifting the burden from transmission to inference: it encodes video into extremely compact representations and delegates content reconstruction to the receiver, where powerful generative priors synthesize high-quality video from minimal transmitted information. Is GVC practical and deployable? To ensure practical deployment, we propose a compression-computation trade-off strategy, enabling fast inference on consume-grade GPUs. Within the AI Flow framework, GVC opens new possibility for video communication in bandwidth- and resource-constrained environments such as emergency rescue, remote surveillance, and mobile edge computing. Through empirical validation, we demonstrate that GVC offers a viable path toward a new effective, efficient, scalable, and practical video communication paradigm.

Motivation: 先天性心脏病是新生儿发病和死亡的主要原因。虽然孕早期胎儿超声心动图提供了早期检测的机会，但由于心脏结构小、信噪比低以及操作者间差异大，自动化分析具有挑战性。现有方法需要大量标注数据且性能有限，因此需要一个更有效的解决方案。

Method: 研究采用了自监督超声基础模型USF-MAE。该模型使用掩码自编码在超过370,000张未标记超声图像上进行预训练，涵盖40多个解剖区域。然后将预训练的Vision Transformer编码器在一个包含6,720张孕早期胎儿超声心动图图像的开源数据集上进行微调，用于分类五个类别。

Conclusion: USF-MAE在孕早期胎儿心脏视图分类任务中表现出色，优于基于自然图像预训练的传统监督学习方法。该方法不依赖激进的图像预处理或感兴趣区域裁剪，并能够更好地区分非诊断性帧，为早期胎儿心脏疾病检测提供了有效的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Congenital heart disease remains the most common congenital anomaly and a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Although first-trimester fetal echocardiography offers an opportunity for earlier detection, automated analysis at this stage is challenging due to small cardiac structures, low signal-to-noise ratio, and substantial inter-operator variability. In this work, we evaluate a self-supervised ultrasound foundation model, USF-MAE, for first-trimester fetal heart view classification. USF-MAE is pretrained using masked autoencoding modelling on more than 370,000 unlabelled ultrasound images spanning over 40 anatomical regions and is subsequently fine-tuned for downstream classification. As a proof of concept, the pretrained Vision Transformer encoder was fine-tuned on an open-source dataset of 6,720 first-trimester fetal echocardiography images to classify five categories: aorta, atrioventricular flows, V sign, X sign, and Other. Model performance was benchmarked against supervised convolutional neural network baselines (ResNet-18 and ResNet-50) and a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) model pretrained on natural images (ImageNet-1k). All models were trained and evaluated using identical preprocessing, data splits, and optimization protocols. On an independent test set, USF-MAE achieved the highest performance across all evaluation metrics, with 90.57% accuracy, 91.15% precision, 90.57% recall, and 90.71% F1-score. This represents an improvement of +2.03% in accuracy and +1.98% in F1-score compared with the strongest baseline, ResNet-18. The proposed approach demonstrated robust performance without reliance on aggressive image preprocessing or region-of-interest cropping and showed improved discrimination of non-diagnostic frames.

Abstract: The explosive growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has strained traditional cloud infrastructures, highlighting the need for low-latency and energy-efficient alternatives. Fog computing addresses this by placing computation near the network edge. However, limited and heterogeneous fog resources pose reliability challenges, especially for mission-critical applications. On the other hand, to improve flexibility, applications are deployed as Service Function Chains (SFCs), where each function runs as a Virtual Network Function (VNF). While scalable, this approach is more failure-prone than monolithic deployments, necessitating intelligent redundancy and placement strategies. This paper addresses the reliability-aware SFC placement problem over heterogeneous fog servers through the lens of reliability theory. We explore four redundancy strategies, combining shared vs. dedicated and active vs. standby modes, and propose a general framework to minimize latency and cost while meeting reliability and deadline constraints. The problem is formulated as an Integer Non-Linear Program (INLP), and two genetic algorithm (GA)-based solutions are developed. Simulation results show that shared-standby redundancy outperforms the conventional dedicated-active approach by up to 84%.

Abstract: Semantic communications conveys task-relevant meaning rather than focusing solely on message reconstruction, improving bandwidth efficiency and robustness for next-generation wireless systems. However, learned semantic representations can still leak sensitive information to unintended receivers (eavesdroppers). This paper presents a deep learning-based semantic communication framework that jointly supports multiple receiver tasks while explicitly limiting semantic leakage to an eavesdropper. The legitimate link employs a learned encoder at the transmitter, while the receiver trains decoders for semantic inference and data reconstruction. The security problem is formulated via an iterative min-max optimization in which an eavesdropper is trained to improve its semantic inference, while the legitimate transmitter-receiver pair is trained to preserve task performance while reducing the eavesdropper's success. We also introduce an auxiliary layer that superimposes a cooperative, adversarially crafted perturbation on the transmitted waveform to degrade semantic leakage to an eavesdropper. Performance is evaluated over Rayleigh fading channels with additive white Gaussian noise using MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. Semantic accuracy and reconstruction quality improve with increasing latent dimension, while the min-max mechanism reduces the eavesdropper's inference performance significantly without degrading the legitimate receiver. The perturbation layer is successful in reducing semantic leakage even when the legitimate link is trained only for its own task. This comprehensive framework motivates semantic communication designs with tunable, end-to-end privacy against adaptive adversaries in realistic wireless settings.

Motivation: 现有MEC系统在存在障碍物遮挡时，空地段通信质量会显著下降，影响计算任务的服务质量。为了增强空地段连通性、降低任务完成延迟和能耗，需要结合IRS和UAV技术优化任务卸载、轨迹控制、相移配置和资源分配。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-enabled low-altitude multi-access edge computing (MEC) architecture, where an aerial MEC server cooperates with a terrestrial MEC server to provide computing services, while hybrid IRSs (i.e., building-installed and UAV-carried IRSs) are deployed to enhance the air-ground connectivity under blockage. Based on this architecture, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem (MOOP) to minimize the task completion delay and energy consumption by jointly optimizing task offloading, UAV trajectory control, IRS phase-shift configuration, and computation resource allocation. The considered problem is NP-hard, and thus we propose a hierarchical online optimization approach (HOOA) to efficiently solve the problem. Specifically, we reformulate the MOOP as a Stackelberg game, where MEC servers collectively act as the leader to determine the system-level decisions, while the vehicles act as followers to make individual decisions. At the follower level, we present a many-to-one matching mechanism to generate feasible discrete decisions. At the leader level, we propose a generative diffusion model-enhanced twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (GDMTD3) algorithm integrated with a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT)-based method, which is a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based approach, to determine the continuous decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed HOOA achieves significant improvements, which reduces average task completion delay by 2.5% and average energy consumption by 3.1% compared with the best-performing benchmark approach and state-of-the-art DRL algorithm, respectively. Moreover, the proposed HOOA exhibits superior convergence stability while maintaining strong robustness and scalability in dynamic environments.

Abstract: Effective communication is essential in distributed training, with predictability being one of its most significant characteristics. However, existing studies primarily focus on exploiting predictability through online profiling for runtime optimization, without a systematic understanding of it. In this work, we aim to systematically formulate communication predictability in distributed training, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs) that utilize hybrid parallelism. Our analysis focuses on both traffic patterns and communication overhead. Specifically, we investigate predictable traffic patterns in typical LLMs and evaluate how various factors influence GPU utilization and effective bandwidth (two critical variables affecting communication overhead). Furthermore, we develop an analytical formulation to estimate communication overhead in LLM training, which is validated with high accuracy against empirical data. Leveraging this formulation, we propose a configuration tuning tool, ConfigTuner, to optimize training performance. Compared to Megatron-LM, the training configurations optimized by ConfigTuner demonstrate up to a 1.36$\times$ increase in throughput. Compared to Alpa, ConfigTuner generates the same configuration suggestion while significantly reducing the search complexity.

Abstract: With the integration of cellular networks in vertical industries that demand precise location information, such as vehicle-to-everything (V2X), public safety, and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), positioning has become an imperative component for future wireless networks. By exploiting a wider spectrum, multiple antennas and flexible architectures, cellular positioning achieves ever-increasing positioning accuracy. Still, it faces fundamental performance degradation when the distance between user equipment (UE) and the base station (BS) is large or in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios. To this end, the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) Rel-18 proposes to standardize sidelink (SL) positioning, which provides unique opportunities to extend the positioning coverage via direct positioning signaling between UEs. Despite the standardization advancements, the capability of SL positioning is controversial, especially how much spectrum is required to achieve the positioning accuracy defined in 3GPP. To this end, this article summarizes the latest standardization advancements of 3GPP on SL positioning comprehensively, covering a) network architecture; b) positioning types; and c) performance requirements. The capability of SL positioning using various positioning methods under different imperfect factors is evaluated and discussed in-depth. Finally, according to the evolution of SL in 3GPP Rel-19, we discuss the possible research directions and challenges of SL positioning.
