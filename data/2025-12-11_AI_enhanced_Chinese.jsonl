However, existing studies often overlook the challenges of gradient conflicts and dominant gradients that arise during the optimization of shared parameters. Moreover, many current approaches fail to simultaneously capture both agreement and disagreement information, relying only on a limited shared subset of target features and consequently missing the rich, diverse patterns present in the target scene. To address these issues, we propose an Agreement Disagreement Guided Knowledge Transfer (ADGKT) framework that integrates both mechanisms to enhance cross-scene transfer. The agreement component includes GradVac, which aligns gradient directions to mitigate conflicts between source and target domains, and LogitNorm, which regulates logit magnitudes to prevent domination by a single gradient source. The disagreement component consists of a Disagreement Restriction (DiR) and an ensemble strategy, which capture diverse predictive target features and mitigate the loss of critical target information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in achieving robust and balanced knowledge transfer across heterogeneous HSI scenes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To compensate for the electromagnetic torque generated alongside the electromagnetic force, in most previous studies, all satellites were assumed to have reaction wheels (RWs) besides electromagnetic coils. However, the RW-loaded angular momentum becomes non-uniformly distributed among the satellites, because the electromagnetic torque usually differs between satellites. Without a proper control scheme, this deviation increases over time, and the RWs become saturated quickly, preventing the attitudes of the satellites from being controlled. In this study, a new controller is proposed that enables the electromagnetic force and torque to be controlled simultaneously. The EMFF kinematics derived from the conservation of angular momentum are used for the controller design. This controller can control $n$ satellites without saturating the RWs, and only one set of RWs is required among all satellites. The combination of the proposed controller with a simple unloading control exclusive to the chief satellite results in the elimination of the accumulation of angular momentum in the entire system. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated through numerical simulations of the formation maintenance and formation reconfiguration of a five-satellite system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u7535\u78c1\u7f16\u961f\u98de\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u7535\u78c1\u529b\u4e0e\u8f6c\u77e9\u540c\u6b65\u63a7\u5236\u9632\u6b62\u53cd\u5e94\u8f6e\u9971\u548c", "motivation": "\u7535\u78c1\u7f16\u961f\u98de\u884c\u4ea7\u751f\u7535\u78c1\u8f6c\u77e9\u9700\u8981\u53cd\u5e94\u8f6e\u8865\u507f\u4f46\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\u5bfc\u81f4\u9971\u548c\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u5b88\u6052\u5efa\u7acb\u7535\u78c1\u7f16\u961f\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u8bbe\u8ba1\u540c\u6b65\u63a7\u5236\u8f6c\u77e9\u548c\u529b\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u914d\u5408\u4e3b\u661f\u5378\u8f7d\u63a7\u5236", "result": "\u4e94\u661f\u661f\u5ea7\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4fdd\u6301\u7f16\u961f\u961f\u5f62\u548c\u91cd\u6784\u80fd\u529b", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u4f20\u7edf\u63a8\u8fdb\u7684\u7535\u78c1\u7f16\u961f\u98de\u884c\u4ec5\u9700\u4e00\u661f\u914d\u5907\u53cd\u5e94\u8f6e\u907f\u514d\u7cfb\u7edf\u89d2\u52a8\u91cf\u7d2f\u79ef"}}

To achieve confidentiality, the proposed system opportunistically exploits intrinsic features of feedback-aided URA without adding any overhead or altering its original structure or operational characteristics. As a result, the proposed system preserves the low-cost advantages of URA, including low delay and minimal signaling overhead, while providing secure communication. To secure transmission, each user generates a secret key and an artificial noise sequence from the feedback signal that the BS broadcasts in previous transmission rounds. This feedback depends on the BS-user channel, making it a private signal for each user. The secure transmission is performed by three actions: encrypting the data using the secret key, sending only the parity bits of the LDPC encoded secret key to allow the legitimate receiver to recover it, and masking these parity bits with the artificial noise. For reception, a receiver algorithm is designed for the legitimate user, and a leakage analysis is provided to quantify the information available to the eavesdropper. The simulation results show that meaningful secrecy is achieved in URA without modifying its structure and with negligible impact on standard performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u5b89\u5168\u6280\u672f\u5f15\u5165\u65e0\u6e90\u968f\u673a\u63a5\u5165\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5de7\u5999\u5229\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u56fa\u6709\u7279\u5f81\u5b9e\u73b0\u673a\u5bc6\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u539f\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u9020\u6210\u4efb\u4f55\u4fee\u6539\u6216\u989d\u5916\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u89c6\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u65e0\u6e90\u968f\u673a\u63a5\u5165\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u62a4\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u65b9\u6848\u5f80\u5f80\u4f1a\u7ed9\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e26\u6765\u989d\u5916\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0d\u7b26\u5408\u65e0\u6e90\u968f\u673a\u63a5\u5165\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u521d\u8877\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u7ad9\u5e7f\u64ad\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8ba9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u751f\u6210\u79d8\u5bc6\u5bc6\u94a5\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u566a\u58f0\u5e8f\u5217\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u4f20\u8f93\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u79d8\u5bc6\u5bc6\u94a5\u52a0\u5bc6\u6570\u636e\uff1b2\uff09\u4ec5\u53d1\u9001LDPC\u7f16\u7801\u79d8\u5bc6\u5bc6\u94a5\u7684\u6821\u9a8c\u4f4d\uff1b3\uff09\u7528\u4eba\u5de5\u566a\u58f0\u5c4f\u853d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6821\u9a8c\u4f4d\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5408\u6cd5\u7528\u6237\u7684\u63a5\u6536\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u7a83\u542c\u8005\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u65e0\u6e90\u968f\u673a\u63a5\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u4e14\u5bf9\u6807\u51c6\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u5fae\u4e4e\u5176\u5fae\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u4fdd\u5bc6\u6027\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u975e\u6388\u6743\u7528\u6237\u83b7\u53d6\u4fdd\u5bc6\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u5b89\u5168\u6280\u672f\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u65e0\u6e90\u968f\u673a\u63a5\u5165\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u6709\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4f18\u52bf\u53c8\u5177\u5907\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5b89\u5168\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Our findings show that hallucinations do not result in blanket mistrust but instead lead to context-sensitive trust calibration. Building on the calibrated trust model by Lee & See [2] and Afroogh et al.'s trust-related factors [3], we confirm expectancy [3], [4], prior experience [3], [4], [5], and user expertise & domain knowledge [3], [4] as userrelated (human) trust factors, and identify intuition as an additional factor relevant for hallucination detection. Additionally, we found that trust dynamics are further influenced by contextual factors, particularly perceived risk [3] and decision stakes [6]. Consequently, we validate the recursive trust calibration process proposed by Bl\u00f6baum [7] and extend it by including intuition as a user-related trust factor.

The Act-Then-Measure (ATM) heuristic addresses this challenge by decoupling control and measurement actions within the Action-Contingent Noiselessly Observable Markov Decision Process (ACNO-MDP) framework. However, the standard ATM algorithm relies on a temporal-difference-inspired Q-learning method, which is prone to instability in sparse and noisy environments. In this work, we propose a Bayesian extension to ATM that replaces standard Q-learning with a Kalman filter-style Bayesian update, maintaining uncertainty-aware estimates of Q-values and enabling more stable and sample-efficient learning. We evaluate our method in both toy environments and clinically motivated testbeds. In small, tabular environments, Bayesian ATM achieves comparable or improved scalarized returns with substantially lower variance and more stable policy behavior. In contrast, in larger and more complex mHealth settings, both the standard and Bayesian ATM variants perform poorly, suggesting a mismatch between ATM's modeling assumptions and the structural challenges of real-world mHealth domains.

We interestingly observe that, even when video frames are scrambled, models perform very well on the existing benchmarks by comprehensive experiments. This implies that VLMMs may not necessarily rely on accurate sequential processing of visual events, but instead depend on prior knowledge of typical scenarios to answer the question. To benchmark temporal understanding capabilities in VLMMs, we propose VECTOR, designed to explicitly assess a model's ability to identify the temporal order of events. On this benchmark, we observe that various VLMMs often fail to understand the orders of events. To address this, we propose MECOT (Multi-Event instruction fine-tuning with Chain-of-Thought), which (1) trains models on detailed, event-by-event video descriptions and (2) using chain-of-thought prompts at inference to enhance temporal awareness. MECOT outperforms prior arts on VECTOR as well as improving performance on existing video benchmarks, implying effectiveness of temporal understanding.

A significant technical challenge in beam hopping is the computation of effective illumination patterns. Traditional algorithms, like the genetic algorithm, require over 300 seconds to compute a single illumination pattern for just 37 cells, whereas modern HTS typically covers over 300 cells, rendering current methods impractical for real-world applications. Advanced approaches, such as multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, face convergence issues when the number of cells exceeds 40. In this paper, we introduce Tyche, a hybrid computation framework designed to address this challenge. Tyche incorporates a Monte Carlo Tree Search Beam Hopping (MCTS-BH) algorithm for computing illumination patterns and employs sliding window and pruning techniques to significantly reduce computation time. Specifically, MCTS-BH can compute one illumination pattern for 37 cells in just 12 seconds. To ensure real-time computation, we use a Greedy Beam Hopping (G-BH) algorithm, which provides a provisional solution while MCTS-BH completes its computation in the background. Our evaluation results show that MCTS-BH can increase throughput by up to 98.76%, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This manuscript develops a nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) framework that generates feasible controls for a servicer satellite to achieve zero-impulse contact with a free-spinning target satellite. The overall maneuver requires coordination between two separately actuated modules of the servicer satellite: (1) a moment generation module and (2) a manipulation module. We apply MPC to control both modules by explicitly modeling the cross-coupling dynamics between them. We demonstrate that the MPC controller can enforce actuation and state constraints that prior control approaches could not account for. We evaluate the performance of the MPC controller by simulating zero-impulse contact scenarios with a free-spinning target satellite via numerical Monte Carlo (MC) trials and comparing the simulation results with prior control approaches. Our simulation results validate the effectiveness of the MPC controller in maintaining spin synchronization and zero-impulse contact under operation constraints, moving contact location, and observation and actuation noise.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff08MPC\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f7f\u670d\u52a1\u536b\u661f\u4e0e\u81ea\u7531\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u536b\u661f\u5b9e\u73b0\u96f6\u51b2\u91cf\u63a5\u89e6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u8c03\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u5b83\u4eec\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8026\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u8f68\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u536b\u661f\u9700\u8981\u4e0e\u81ea\u7531\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u536b\u661f\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u89e6\u4ee5\u5b8c\u6210\u5728\u8f68\u670d\u52a1\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u534f\u8c03\u9a71\u52a8\u670d\u52a1\u536b\u661f\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u529b\u77e9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u6a21\u5757\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u5b83\u4eec\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u8026\u5408\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cMPC\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u64cd\u4f5c\u7ea6\u675f\u3001\u63a5\u89e6\u70b9\u79fb\u52a8\u4ee5\u53ca\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u9a71\u52a8\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7ef4\u6301\u65cb\u8f6c\u540c\u6b65\u548c\u96f6\u51b2\u91cf\u63a5\u89e6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684MPC\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5728\u9a71\u52a8\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u4e0e\u81ea\u7531\u65cb\u8f6c\u76ee\u6807\u536b\u661f\u7684\u96f6\u51b2\u91cf\u63a5\u89e6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u8f68\u670d\u52a1\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Second, existing frameworks like ISO 42001 and NIST AI RMF remain at high conceptual levels, offering principles without actionable controls, leaving practitioners unable to translate governance requirements into specific technical implementations.

Yet screening agents must master conversational timing, prosody, backchannels, and what to attend to in faces and speech for Depression and PTSD. Most simulators omit policy learning with nonverbal dynamics; many controllers chase task accuracy while underweighting trust, pacing, and rapport. We virtualise the humanoid as a conversational agent to train without hardware burden. Our agent-centred, simulation-first pipeline turns interview data into 276 Unreal Engine MetaHuman patients with synchronised speech, gaze/face, and head-torso poses, plus PHQ-8 and PCL-C flows. A perception-fusion-policy loop decides what and when to speak, when to backchannel, and how to avoid interruptions, under a safety shield. Training uses counterfactual replay (bounded nonverbal perturbations) and an uncertainty-aware turn manager that probes to reduce diagnostic ambiguity. Results are simulation-only; the humanoid is the transfer target. In comparing three controllers, a custom TD3 (Twin Delayed DDPG) outperformed PPO and CEM, achieving near-ceiling coverage with steadier pace at comparable rewards. Decision-quality analyses show negligible turn overlap, aligned cut timing, fewer clarification prompts, and shorter waits. Performance stays stable under modality dropout and a renderer swap, and rankings hold on a held-out patient split. Contributions: (1) an agent-centred simulator that turns interviews into 276 interactive patients with bounded nonverbal counterfactuals; (2) a safe learning loop that treats timing and rapport as first-class control variables; (3) a comparative study (TD3 vs PPO/CEM) with clear gains in completeness and social timing; and (4) ablations and robustness analyses explaining the gains and enabling clinician-supervised humanoid pilots.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

By leveraging a multi-agent system, we generate challenging and visually-rich multi-image QA pairs to fully activate the tool-use potential of the base VLM. Through manual verification, we obtain MIFG-QA, comprising 10k samples for training and evaluation. With deeper reasoning steps, VLMs may increasingly ignore visual inputs. We therefore develop two specialized tools for visual reflection and confirmation, allowing the model to proactively reallocate its attention to image content during inference. Benefiting from our well-designed action-trajectory two-level mask strategy, IMAgent achieves stable tool use behavior via pure RL training without requiring costly supervised fine-tuning data.

Electrocardiogram (ECG), as a non-invasive method to collect heart activities, is used to diagnose cardiac conditions. Analyzing the ECG typically requires domain expertise, which is a roadblock to applying artificial intelligence (AI) for healthcare. Through advances in self-supervised learning and foundation models, AI systems can now acquire and leverage domain knowledge without relying solely on human expertise. However, there is a lack of comprehensive analyses over the foundation models' performance on ECG. This study aims to answer the research question: \"Are Foundation Models Useful for ECG Analysis?\" To address it, we evaluate language/general time-series/ECG foundation models in comparison with time-series deep learning models. The experimental results show that general time-series/ECG foundation models achieve a top performance rate of 80%, indicating their effectiveness in ECG analysis.

This bias is extremely critical in large multicultural cities, especially where biometrics play a major role in smart city infrastructure. The entanglement can cause demographic attributes to overshadow identity cues in the embedding space, resulting in disparities in verification performance across different demographic groups. To address this issue, we propose a novel strategy, Unified Text-Image Embedding (UTIE), which aims to induce demographic ambiguity in face embeddings by enriching them with information related to other demographic groups. This encourages face embeddings to emphasize identity-relevant features and thus promotes fairer verification performance across groups. UTIE leverages the zero-shot capabilities and cross-modal semantic alignment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Given that VLMs are naturally trained to align visual and textual representations, we enrich the facial embeddings of each demographic group with text-derived demographic features extracted from other demographic groups. This encourages a more neutral representation in terms of demographic attributes. We evaluate UTIE using three VLMs, CLIP, OpenCLIP, and SigLIP, on two widely used benchmarks, RFW and BFW, designed to assess bias in FR. Experimental results show that UTIE consistently reduces bias metrics while maintaining, or even improving in several cases, the face verification accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Consequently, evaluating the F/V strength has become an important task in power electronics (PE)-dominated power systems. Existing methods typically examine F/V strength separately, employing fundamentally different metrics, such as inertia (focusing on device dynamics) and short-circuit ratio (SCR, addressing network characteristics). These fragmented approaches have resulted in a lack of comprehensive understanding of the overall system strength, potentially overlooking critical aspects. To address this problem, this paper proposes a unified framework for analyzing F/V strength. First, a unified modeling of F/V regulations is introduced. Then, based on modal decoupling, the power systems are decomposed into several eigen-subsystems, where the F/V responses are both decomposed into common-mode (CM) and differential-mode (DM) components, namely, CM-F, DM-F, CM-V, and DM-V. The CM-F and CM-V represent the collective response of all devices to external active or reactive power disturbances, independent of the power network characteristics. In contrast, the DM-F and DM-V capture the redistribution of disturbance power within the system, which is strongly influenced by the network topology and the locations of devices. Notably, traditional strength analysis generally ignores the CM-V (global voltage response), which, as discovered in this paper, may also become unstable in PE-dominated power systems. Based on the proposed framework, new metrics are proposed to evaluate the strength of each modal component. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u6790\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u9891\u7387/\u7535\u538b\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u6001\u89e3\u8026\u5c06\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u5171\u6a21\u548c\u5dee\u6a21\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3aPE\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f3a\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u57fa\u4e8e\u9006\u53d8\u5668\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u5e76\u7f51\uff0c\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9891\u7387/\u7535\u538b\u54cd\u5e94\u6076\u5316\uff0c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u589e\u52a0\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5355\u72ec\u8bc4\u4f30\u9891\u7387\u548c\u7535\u538b\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u6574\u4f53\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5168\u9762\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5ffd\u89c6\u5173\u952e\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "method": "1. \u5efa\u7acb\u9891\u7387/\u7535\u538b\u8c03\u8282\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2. \u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u6001\u89e3\u8026\u5c06\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u82e5\u5e72\u7279\u5f81\u5b50\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c06\u9891\u7387/\u7535\u538b\u54cd\u5e94\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5171\u6a21\u548c\u5dee\u6a21\u5206\u91cf\uff08CM-F\u3001DM-F\u3001CM-V\u3001DM-V\uff09\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u6307\u6807\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u91cf\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff1b4. \u901a\u8fc7\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u901a\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u5171\u6a21\u7535\u538b\u54cd\u5e94\uff08CM-V\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u5728PE\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0cCM-V\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8bc4\u4f30\u5404\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u91cf\u7684\u5f3a\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aPE\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9891\u7387/\u7535\u538b\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u5206\u5171\u6a21\u548c\u5dee\u6a21\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5171\u6a21\u7535\u538b\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on downstream tasks via fine-tuning, aligning with the semantic communication shift toward task-oriented understanding over bit-level accuracy.\n  Motivated by this, we propose Large Language Models for XL-MIMO Channel Estimation (LLM4XCE), a novel channel estimation framework that leverages the semantic modeling capabilities of large language models to recover essential spatial-channel representations for downstream tasks. The model integrates a carefully designed embedding module with Parallel Feature-Spatial Attention, enabling deep fusion of pilot features and spatial structures to construct a semantically rich representation for LLM input. By fine-tuning only the top two Transformer layers, our method effectively captures latent dependencies in the pilot data while ensuring high training efficiency. Extensive simulations demonstrate that LLM4XCE significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods under hybrid-field conditions, achieving superior estimation accuracy and generalization performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We present \\textbf{Consist-Retinex}, the first framework adapting consistency modeling to Retinex-based low-light enhancement.

Even worse, these applications often have strict, yet heterogeneous, performance requirements across metrics like latency and reliability. Much recent work has thus focused on developing the ability to predict network performance. However, traditional methods for network modeling, like discrete event simulators and emulation, often fail to balance accuracy and scalability. Network Digital Twins (NDTs), augmented by machine learning, present a viable solution by creating virtual replicas of physical networks for real- time simulation and analysis. State-of-the-art models, however, fall short of full-fledged NDTs, as they often focus only on a single performance metric or simulated network data. We introduce M3Net, a Multi-Metric Mixture-of-experts (MoE) NDT that uses a graph neural network architecture to estimate multiple performance metrics from an expanded set of network state data in a range of scenarios. We show that M3Net significantly enhances the accuracy of flow delay predictions by reducing the MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) from 20.06% to 17.39%, while also achieving 66.47% and 78.7% accuracy on jitter and packets dropped for each flow", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing testing approaches often rely on surrogate models of decision-making agents to generate large-scale scenario libraries; however, discrepancies between surrogate models and real decision-making agents significantly limit their generalizability and practical applicability. To address this challenge, this paper proposes intelligent resilience testing (IRTest), a unified online adaptive testing framework designed to rapidly adjust to diverse decision-making agents. IRTest initializes with an offline-trained surrogate prediction model and progressively reduces surrogate-to-real gap during testing through two complementary adaptation mechanisms: (i) online neural fine-tuning in data-rich regimes, and (ii) lightweight importance-sampling-based weighting correction in data-limited regimes. A Bayesian optimization strategy, equipped with bias-corrected acquisition functions, guides scenario generation to balance exploration and exploitation in complex testing spaces. Extensive experiments across varying levels of task complexity and system heterogeneity demonstrate that IRTest consistently improves failure-discovery efficiency, testing robustness, and cross-system generalizability. These results highlight the potential of IRTest as a practical solution for scalable, adaptive, and resilient testing of decision-making agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper examines image labeling performance across human participants and deep neural networks, focusing on low-resolution, perceptually degraded stimuli. Drawing from computational cognitive science, cognitive architectures, and connectionist-symbolic hybrid models, we contrast human strategies such as analogical reasoning, shape-based recognition, and confidence modulation with AI's feature-based processing. Grounded in Marr's tri-level hypothesis, Simon's bounded rationality, and Thagard's frameworks of representation and emotion, we analyze participant responses in relation to Grad-CAM visualizations of model attention. Human behavior is further interpreted through cognitive principles modeled in ACT-R and Soar, revealing layered and heuristic decision strategies under uncertainty. Our findings highlight key parallels and divergences between biological and artificial systems in representation, inference, and confidence calibration.

Recently, deep learning based Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI) approaches have greatly improved recognition accuracy. However, their large model sizes and high computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. While model pruning offers a general solution for complexity reduction, existing weight, channel, and layer pruning techniques struggle to concurrently optimize compression rate, hardware acceleration, and recognition accuracy. To this end, in this paper, we introduce HSCP, a Hierarchical Spectral Clustering Pruning framework that combines layer pruning with channel pruning to achieve extreme compression, high performance, and efficient inference. In the first stage, HSCP employs spectral clustering guided by Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) to identify and remove redundant layers. Subsequently, the same strategy is applied to the channel dimension to eliminate a finer redundancy. To ensure robustness, we further employ a noise-robust fine-tuning strategy. Experiments on the UAV-M100 benchmark demonstrate that HSCP outperforms existing channel and layer pruning methods. Specifically, HSCP achieves $86.39\\%$ parameter reduction and $84.44\\%$ FLOPs reduction on ResNet18 while improving accuracy by $1.49\\%$ compared to the unpruned baseline, and maintains superior robustness even in low signal-to-noise ratio environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8ba4\u8bc1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\u4fee\u526a\u6846\u67b6HSCP\uff0c\u5c06\u5c42\u4fee\u526a\u4e0e\u901a\u9053\u4fee\u526a\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u4ee5\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8eab\u4efd\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u8981\u6c42\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5c04\u9891\u6307\u7eb9\u8bc6\u522b\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u6709\u66f4\u9ad8\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u90e8\u7f72\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u526a\u679d\u6280\u672f\u4e5f\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u3001\u786c\u4ef6\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5206\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u9891\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\u4fee\u526a\u6846\u67b6\uff08HSCP\uff09\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5728\u4ee5CKA\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u9891\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u53bb\u9664\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u5c42\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5c06\u540c\u6837\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u901a\u9053\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u66f4\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u5197\u4f59\uff1b\u4e3a\u4e86\u786e\u4fdd\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u91c7\u7528\u4e86\u6297\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728UAV-M100\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\uff0cHSCP\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u901a\u9053\u548c\u5c42\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u800c\u8a00\uff0c\u5728ResNet-18\u4e0a\uff0c\u5176\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8686.39%\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0e84.44%\u7684FLOPs\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u4e14\u8bc6\u522b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6bd4\u672a\u526a\u679d\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e861.49%\uff1b\u5373\u4fbf\u5728\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "HSCP\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5c42\u4e0e\u901a\u9053\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u53ef\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u6781\u7aef\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e14\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5177\u6709\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8ba4\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This phenomenon of data-efficiency has been proven for certain classes of elliptic operators with simple geometry, i.e., operators that do not change the domain of the function or propagate singularities. However, scientific machine learning is commonly used for problems that do involve the propagation of singularities in a priori unknown ways, such as waves, advection, and fluid dynamics. In light of this, we expand the learning theory to include double fibration transforms--geometric integral operators that include generalized Radon and geodesic ray transforms. We prove that this class of operators does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality: the error decays superalgebraically, that is, faster than any fixed power of the reciprocal of the number of training samples. Furthermore, we investigate architectures that explicitly encode the geometry of these transforms, demonstrating that an architecture reminiscent of cross-attention based on levelset methods yields a parameterization that is universal, stable, and learns double fibration transforms from very few training examples. Our results contribute to a rapidly-growing line of theoretical work on learning operators for scientific machine learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u5305\u542b\u5e7f\u4e49Radon\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u5c04\u7ebf\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u53cc\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5316\u53d8\u6362\u7c7b\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u4f20\u64ad\u5947\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u4e5f\u80fd\u907f\u514d\u7ef4\u5ea6\u707e\u96be\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u8870\u51cf\u901f\u5ea6\u8d85\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u56fa\u5b9a\u5e42\u6b21\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5df2\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u692d\u5706\u7b97\u5b50\u7b49\u7b80\u5355\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u4f46\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5e38\u6d89\u53ca\u672a\u77e5\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u5947\u5f02\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982\u6ce2\u52a8\u3001\u5e73\u6d41\u3001\u6d41\u4f53\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff09\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u672a\u80fd\u6db5\u76d6\u53cc\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5316\u53d8\u6362\u8fd9\u7c7b\u51e0\u4f55\u79ef\u5206\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u62d3\u5c55\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u62d3\u5c55\u5230\u53cc\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5316\u53d8\u6362\u7c7b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8fd9\u7c7b\u7b97\u5b50\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u707e\u96be\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u7814\u7a76\u80fd\u663e\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d8\u6362\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6c34\u5e73\u96c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5f0f\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u666e\u9002\u6027\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u53cc\u7ea4\u7ef4\u5316\u53d8\u6362\u7c7b\u7b97\u5b50\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u4ee3\u6570\u8bef\u5dee\u8870\u51cf\uff08\u8bef\u5dee\u8870\u51cf\u901f\u5ea6\u8d85\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u6570\u5012\u6570\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u56fa\u5b9a\u5e42\u6b21\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u4ec5\u7528\u6781\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd9\u7c7b\u7b97\u5b50\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7b97\u5b50\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u5947\u5f02\u6027\u4f20\u64ad\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u79ef\u5206\u7b97\u5b50\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e3a\u6ce2\u52a8\u3001\u5e73\u6d41\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u7269\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

However, packet losses in wireless communication can cause critical safety issues when they occur in conjunction with sudden brakes.

For our proposed time-discretized simulations, we provide two methods for selecting different time-step intervals to ensure that the error in distance approximation remains within specified bounds at all times.

Traditional approaches rely heavily on task-specific models and domain-specific feature engineering. This is time-consuming, computationally expensive, and requires domain expertise and therefore not scalable. We present LUMOS (Large User MOdel Series), a transformer-based architecture that eliminates task-specific models and manual feature engineering by learning multiple tasks jointly using only raw user activity data. LUMOS introduces a novel cross-attention mechanism that conditions predictions on future known events (e.g., holidays, sales, etc.), enabling the model to predict complex behaviour patterns like \"how will upcoming holidays affect user engagement?\" The architecture also employs multi-modal tokenization, combining user transactions, event context, and static user demographic attributes into rich representations processed through specialized embedding pathways.\n  Through extensive experiments on a production dataset spanning 275 billion user activity tokens from 250 million users, we demonstrate that LUMOS achieves superior performance compared to traditional task-specific models. Across 5 tasks with established baselines, we achieve an average improvement of 0.025 in ROC-AUC for binary classification tasks and 4.6\\% reduction in MAPE for regression tasks.

We assume relays or repeaters in groups or layers spatially separated. Under ideal circumstances SISO narrow-band communication and TDD, the system may be viewed as a dual to a deep neural network, where activations, corresponding to repeater amplifications, are optimized and weight matrices, corresponding to channel matrices, are static. Repeater amplifications are locally optimized layer-by-layer in a forward-backward manner over compact sets. The method is applicable for a wide range of constraints on within-layer power/energy utilization, is furthermore gradient-free, step-size-free, and has proven monotonicity in the objective. Numerical simulations show significant improvement compared to upper bounds on the expected SNR. In addition, power distribution over multiple repeaters is shown to be superior to optimal selection of single repeaters in the layers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recent advances in generative modelling, including autoregressive, diffusion, and flow-based approaches, have enabled de novo ligand design beyond the limits of enumerative screening. Yet these models often suffer from inadequate generalization, limited interpretability, and an overemphasis on binding affinity at the expense of key pharmacological properties, thereby restricting their translational utility. Here we present Trio, a molecular generation framework integrating fragment-based molecular language modeling, reinforcement learning, and Monte Carlo tree search, for effective and interpretable closed-loop targeted molecular design. Through the three key components, Trio enables context-aware fragment assembly, enforces physicochemical and synthetic feasibility, and guides a balanced search between the exploration of novel chemotypes and the exploitation of promising intermediates within protein binding pockets. Experimental results show that Trio reliably achieves chemically valid and pharmacologically enhanced ligands, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches with improved binding affinity (+7.85%), drug-likeness (+11.10%) and synthetic accessibility (+12.05%), while expanding molecular diversity more than fourfold.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, in 3D domains, the design space grows exponentially, rendering exhaustive grid-based searches infeasible. Recent advances in deep learning have accelerated inverse design by providing powerful generative priors and differentiable surrogate models. Nevertheless, current methods tend to approximate the 3D design space using 2D projections or fine-tune existing 3D shapes. These approaches sacrifice volumetric detail and constrain design exploration, preventing true 3D design from scratch. In this paper, we propose a 3D Inverse Design (3DID) framework that directly navigates the 3D design space by coupling a continuous latent representation with a physics-aware optimization strategy. We first learn a unified physics-geometry embedding that compactly captures shape and physical field data in a continuous latent space. Then, we introduce a two-stage strategy to perform physics-aware optimization. In the first stage, a gradient-guided diffusion sampler explores the global latent manifold. In the second stage, an objective-driven, topology-preserving refinement further sculpts each candidate toward the target objective.

We introduce modeling adjustments that make the three-tank dynamics numerically tractable, including additional modes to avoid non-Lipschitz points and undefined function values. Hardware experiments demonstrate efficient handling of switching events, mode-consistent tracking across reference changes, correct boundary handling, and constraint satisfaction.

Despite their impressive capabilities, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, as even minor meaning-preserving changes such as synonym substitutions can lead to incorrect predictions. As a result, certifying the robustness of LLMs against such adversarial prompts is of vital importance. Existing approaches focused on word deletion or simple denoising strategies to achieve robustness certification. However, these methods face two critical limitations: (1) they yield loose robustness bounds due to the lack of semantic validation for perturbed outputs and (2) they suffer from high computational costs due to repeated sampling. To address these limitations, we propose CluCERT, a novel framework for certifying LLM robustness via clustering-guided denoising smoothing. Specifically, to achieve tighter certified bounds, we introduce a semantic clustering filter that reduces noisy samples and retains meaningful perturbations, supported by theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we enhance computational efficiency through two mechanisms: a refine module that extracts core semantics, and a fast synonym substitution strategy that accelerates the denoising process. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on various downstream tasks and jailbreak defense scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing certified approaches in both robustness bounds and computational efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A belief survives communication only if it avoids the null spaces of these maps, yielding a structural criterion for intelligibility, miscommunication, and belief death.\n  Within this framework, I show how belief distortion, motivational drift, counterfactual evaluation, and the limits of mutual understanding arise from purely algebraic constraints. A central result-\"the No-Null-Space Leadership Condition\"-characterizes leadership as a property of representational reachability rather than persuasion or authority. More broadly, the model explains how abstract beings can propagate, mutate, or disappear as they traverse diverse cognitive geometries.\n  The account unifies insights from conceptual spaces, social epistemology, and AI value alignment by grounding meaning preservation in structural compatibility rather than shared information or rationality.

Inspired by biological systems where structure and function emerge from low-energy configurations, we introduce StructuredDNA, a sparse architecture framework for modular, energy-aware Transformer routing. StructuredDNA replaces dense Mixture-of-Experts routing with a bio-physical, energy-guided routing layer based on semantic energy minimization. Inputs are dynamically grouped into semantic codons, and routing selects a single expert by minimizing a global energy functional that combines cohesion, uncertainty, and computational cost.\n  We validate StructuredDNA on both specialized (BioASQ) and open-domain benchmarks (WikiText-103). On BioASQ (K = 50), we achieve a 97.7% reduction in Energy Utilization Density (EUD) and a Semantic Stability Index (SSI) of 0.998. We further demonstrate a Semantic Scaling Law on WikiText-103, showing that the architecture generalizes to open domains by scaling expert granularity (K = 2048) while maintaining more than 99% energy efficiency. StructuredDNA thus establishes a robust, domain-agnostic paradigm for future sparse computational frameworks.\n  StructuredDNA provides an explicit link between bio-physical principles and sparse expert routing in Transformer architectures, and points toward future energy-aware, modular, and scalable computational systems. We discuss limitations of this proof-of-concept study and outline directions for scaling the approach to larger models, datasets, and hardware platforms.

Most existing deep learning approaches for 3D dose prediction rely on reference plans as ground truth during training, which can inadvertently bias models toward specific planning styles or institutional preferences. In this study, we introduce a novel generative model that predicts 3D dose distributions based solely on user-defined preference flavors. These customizable preferences enable planners to prioritize specific trade-offs between organs-at-risk (OARs) and planning target volumes (PTVs), offering greater flexibility and personalization. Designed for seamless integration with clinical treatment planning systems, our approach assists users in generating high-quality plans efficiently.

Existing supervised metal artifact reduction (MAR) approaches suffer from performance instability on known data due to their reliance on limited paired metal-clean data, which limits their clinical applicability. Moreover, existing unsupervised methods face two main challenges: 1) the CT physical geometry is not effectively incorporated into the MAR process to ensure data fidelity; 2) traditional heuristics regularization terms cannot fully capture the abundant prior knowledge available.

Lithography defect data from semiconductor industry are rarely accessible for research use, resulting in a shortage of publicly available datasets. To address this bottleneck in lithography, this study proposes a novel methodology for generating large-scale, physically valid defect datasets with pixel-level annotations. The framework begins with the ab initio synthesis of defect layouts using controllable, physics-constrained mathematical morphology operations (erosion and dilation) applied to the original design-level layout. These synthesized layouts, together with their defect-free counterparts, are fabricated into physical samples via high-fidelity digital micromirror device (DMD)-based lithography. Optical micrographs of the synthesized defect samples and their defect-free references are then compared to create consistent defect delineation annotations. Using this methodology, we constructed a comprehensive dataset of 3,530 Optical micrographs containing 13,365 annotated defect instances including four classes: bridge, burr, pinch, and contamination. Each defect instance is annotated with a pixel-accurate segmentation mask, preserving full contour and geometry. The segmentation-based Mask R-CNN achieves AP@0.5 of 0.980, 0.965, and 0.971, compared with 0.740, 0.719, and 0.717 for Faster R-CNN on bridge, burr, and pinch classes, representing a mean AP@0.5 improvement of approximately 34%. For the contamination class, Mask R-CNN achieves an AP@0.5 roughly 42% higher than Faster R-CNN.

Corresponding cues are the imaging tasks formulated in response, which incorporate sensor constraints, timing requirements, and utility functions. The system autonomously generates candidate tasks, optimizes their scheduling across multiple satellites using continuous utility functions that reflect the expected value of each observation, and processes the resulting imagery using artificial-intelligence-based models, including object detectors and vision-language models.

Recent research suggests that large language models (LLMs) encode rich semantic knowledge about the world, which can be valuable for guiding agents in high-level reasoning and planning across both embodied and purely textual settings. However, existing approaches often depend heavily on querying LLMs during training and inference, making them computationally expensive and difficult to deploy efficiently. In addition, these methods typically employ a pretrained, unaltered LLM whose parameters remain fixed throughout training, providing no opportunity for adaptation to the target task. To address these limitations, we introduce SCOPE (Subgoal-COnditioned Pretraining for Efficient planning), a one-shot hierarchical planner that leverages LLM-generated subgoals only at initialization to pretrain a lightweight student model. Unlike prior approaches that distill LLM knowledge by repeatedly prompting the model to adaptively generate subgoals during training, our method derives subgoals directly from example trajectories. This design removes the need for repeated LLM queries, significantly improving efficiency, though at the cost of reduced explainability and potentially suboptimal subgoals. Despite their suboptimality, our results on the TextCraft environment show that LLM-generated subgoals can still serve as a strong starting point for hierarchical goal decomposition in text-based planning tasks.

To address this, we extend token compression to the visual encoder through an effective iterative merging scheme that is orthogonal in spatial axes to accelerate the computation across the entire VLM. Furthermoer, we integrate a spectrum pruning unit into LLM through an attention/similarity-free low-pass filter, which gradually prunes redundant visual tokens and is fully compatible to modern FlashAttention.

By evaluating these approaches under a unified setup, we provide a clearer understanding of how each data source contributes to predictive skill over the Continental United States (CONUS). Forecasts are produced at 1-km spatial resolution, beginning with direct 1-hour predictions and extending to 12 hours using autoregressive rollouts. Performance is evaluated using both CONUS-wide and region-specific metrics that assess overall performance and skill at extreme rainfall thresholds. Across all lead times, our DL framework consistently outperforms the HRRR baseline in pixel-wise and spatiostatistical metrics. The hybrid model performs best at the shortest lead time, while the HRRR-corrective model outperforms others at longer lead times, maintaining high skill through 12 hours. To assess reliability, we incorporate calibrated uncertainty quantification tailored to the residual learning setup.

Despite predicting occurrence of heatwaves and attributing historical mortality, predicting an incoming deadly heatwave remains a challenge due to the difficulty in defining and estimating heat-related mortality. Furthermore, establishing an early warning system imposes additional requirements, including data availability, spatial and temporal robustness, and decision costs. To address these challenges, we propose DeepTherm, a modular early warning system for deadly heatwave prediction without requiring heat-related mortality history. By highlighting the flexibility of deep learning, DeepTherm employs a dual-prediction pipeline, disentangling baseline mortality in the absence of heatwaves and other irregular events from all-cause mortality. We evaluated DeepTherm on real-world data across Spain. Results demonstrate consistent, robust, and accurate performance across diverse regions, time periods, and population groups while allowing trade-off between missed alarms and false alarms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

LiDAR is widely used in construction because it offers advantages over camera-based systems, performing reliably in cluttered and dynamically changing conditions. Yet most public datasets for 3D perception are derived from densely fused scans with uniform sampling and complete visibility, conditions that do not reflect real construction sites. Field data are often collected as isolated single-station LiDAR views, constrained by safety requirements, limited access, and ongoing operations. These factors lead to radial density decay, fragmented geometry, and view-dependent visibility-characteristics that remain underrepresented in existing datasets. This paper presents SIP, Site in Pieces, a dataset created to reflect the practical constraints of LiDAR acquisition during construction. SIP provides indoor and outdoor scenes captured with a terrestrial LiDAR scanner and annotated at the point level using a taxonomy tailored to construction environments: A. Built Environment, B. Construction Operations, and C. Site Surroundings. The dataset includes both structural components and slender temporary objects such as scaffolding, MEP piping, and scissor lifts, where sparsity caused by occlusion and fragmented geometry make segmentation particularly challenging. The scanning protocol, annotation workflow, and quality control procedures establish a consistent foundation for the dataset. SIP is openly available with a supporting Git repository, offering adaptable class configurations that streamline adoption within modern 3D deep learning frameworks. By providing field data that retain real-world sensing characteristics, SIP enables robust benchmarking and contributes to advancing construction-oriented 3D vision tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "SIP\uff08Site in Pieces\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6784\u5efa\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4e09\u7ef4\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u53cd\u6620LiDAR\u6570\u636e\u91c7\u96c6\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5ba4\u5185\u5916\u573a\u666f\u3001\u70b9\u7ea7\u6ce8\u91ca\u548c\u9002\u5408\u65bd\u5de5\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e09\u7ef4\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u878d\u5408\u626b\u63cf\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u65bd\u5de5\u573a\u5730\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u5982\u5b89\u5168\u9650\u5236\u3001\u91c7\u96c6\u89d2\u5ea6\u5355\u4e00\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u65bd\u5de5\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5730\u9762LiDAR\u626b\u63cf\u4eea\u91c7\u96c6\u5ba4\u5185\u5916\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9488\u5bf9\u65bd\u5de5\u73af\u5883\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\uff08A. \u5efa\u7b51\u73af\u5883\uff1bB. \u65bd\u5de5\u64cd\u4f5c\uff1bC. \u573a\u5730\u5468\u8fb9\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u70b9\u7ea7\u6ce8\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u626b\u63cf\u534f\u8bae\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u786e\u4fdd\u6570\u636e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "SIP\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u516c\u5f00\u53ef\u7528\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7ed3\u6784\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u7ec6\u957f\u4e34\u65f6\u5bf9\u8c61\uff08\u5982\u811a\u624b\u67b6\u3001\u7ba1\u9053\u3001\u5347\u964d\u673a\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u771f\u5b9e\u4f20\u611f\u7279\u5f81\uff08\u5982\u5f84\u5411\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8870\u51cf\u3001\u788e\u7247\u5316\u51e0\u4f55\uff09\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u4e09\u7ef4\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u9002\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "SIP\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fdd\u7559\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4f20\u611f\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u73b0\u573a\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63a8\u52a8\u9762\u5411\u65bd\u5de5\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002"}}

While recent implementations such as Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) demonstrate high approximation capabilities, they suffer from significant parameter inefficiency due to the requirement of maintaining unique parameterizations for every network edge. In this work, we propose GS-KAN (Generalized Sprecher-KAN), a lightweight architecture inspired by David Sprecher's refinement of the superposition theorem. GS-KAN constructs unique edge functions by applying learnable linear transformations to a single learnable, shared parent function per layer. We evaluate GS-KAN against existing KAN architectures and MLPs across synthetic function approximation, tabular data regression and image classification tasks. Our results demonstrate that GS-KAN outperforms both MLPs and standard KAN baselines on continuous function approximation tasks while maintaining superior parameter efficiency. Additionally, GS-KAN achieves competitive performance with existing KAN architectures on tabular regression and outperforms MLPs on high-dimensional classification tasks. Crucially, the proposed architecture enables the deployment of KAN-based architectures in high-dimensional regimes under strict parameter constraints, a setting where standard implementations are typically infeasible due to parameter explosion.

However, deploying state-of-the-art deep learning models like ConvNeXtV2-Large in clinical settings is hindered by their computational demands. Therefore, it is desirable to develop efficient models that maintain high diagnostic performance while enabling real-time deployment. In this study, a novel knowledge distillation framework, termed KD-OCT, is proposed to compress a high-performance ConvNeXtV2-Large teacher model, enhanced with advanced augmentations, stochastic weight averaging, and focal loss, into a lightweight EfficientNet-B2 student for classifying normal, drusen, and CNV cases. KD-OCT employs real-time distillation with a combined loss balancing soft teacher knowledge transfer and hard ground-truth supervision. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on the Noor Eye Hospital (NEH) dataset using patient-level cross-validation.

However, for a robot implementation, determining which matches are sufficiently good is often reduced to a manually set threshold. And it is difficult to manually select a threshold that will work for a variety of visual scenarios.

AgentComp leverages the reasoning and tool-use capabilities of large language models equipped with image generation, editing, and VQA tools to autonomously construct compositional datasets. Using these datasets, we apply an agentic preference optimization method to fine-tune text-to-image models, enabling them to better distinguish between compositionally similar samples and resulting in overall stronger compositional generation ability.

However, the standard trunk design based on fully connected layers acting on raw spatial or spatiotemporal coordinates struggles to represent sharp gradients, boundary layers, and non-periodic structures commonly found in PDEs posed on bounded domains with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. To address these limitations, we introduce the Spectral-Embedded DeepONet (SEDONet), a new DeepONet variant in which the trunk is driven by a fixed Chebyshev spectral dictionary rather than coordinate inputs. This non-periodic spectral embedding provides a principled inductive bias tailored to bounded domains, enabling the learned operator to capture fine-scale non-periodic features that are difficult for Fourier or MLP trunks to represent. SEDONet is evaluated on a suite of PDE benchmarks including 2D Poisson, 1D Burgers, 1D advection-diffusion, Allen-Cahn dynamics, and the Lorenz-96 chaotic system, covering elliptic, parabolic, advective, and multiscale temporal phenomena, all of which can be viewed as canonical problems in computational mechanics. Across all datasets, SEDONet consistently achieves the lowest relative L2 errors among DeepONet, FEDONet, and SEDONet, with average improvements of about 30-40% over the baseline DeepONet and meaningful gains over Fourier-embedded variants on non-periodic geometries. Spectral analyses further show that SEDONet more accurately preserves high-frequency and boundary-localized features, demonstrating the value of Chebyshev embeddings in non-periodic operator learning. The proposed architecture offers a simple, parameter-neutral modification to DeepONets, delivering a robust and efficient spectral framework for surrogate modeling of PDEs on bounded domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While they have shown to work exceptionally well, they are not without issues, resulting in surprising failure modes and predictably asymmetric performance degradation. This article is a study of many of these observed failure modes of transformers through the lens of graph neural network (GNN) theory. We first make the case that much of deep learning, including transformers, is about learnable information mixing and propagation. This makes the study of model failure modes a study of bottlenecks in information propagation. This naturally leads to GNN theory, where there is already a rich literature on information propagation bottlenecks and theoretical failure modes of models. We then make the case that many issues faced by GNNs are also experienced by transformers. In addition, we analyze how the causal nature of decoder-only transformers create interesting geometric properties in information propagation, resulting in predictable and potentially devastating failure modes. Finally, we observe that existing solutions in transformer research tend to be ad-hoc and driven by intuition rather than grounded theoretical motivation. As such, we unify many such solutions under a more theoretical perspective, providing insight into why they work, what problem they are actually solving, and how they can be further improved to target specific failure modes of transformers. Overall, this article is an attempt to bridge the gap between observed failure modes in transformers and a general lack of theoretical understanding of them in this space.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Multi-noun food categories are common in real-world datasets and account for a large portion of entries in benchmarks such as UEC-256. These compound names often cause generative models to misinterpret the semantics, producing unintended ingredients or objects. This is due to insufficient multi-noun category related knowledge in the text encoder and misinterpretation of multi-noun relationships, leading to incorrect spatial layouts. To overcome these challenges, we propose FoCULR (Food Category Understanding and Layout Refinement) which incorporates food domain knowledge and introduces core concepts early in the generation process.

Instead of describing motion relative to previous frames, our method defines camera trajectories in an absolute coordinate system, allowing precise and interpretable control over camera parameters without requiring an initial reference frame. We leverage panoramic 360-degree videos to construct a wide variety of camera trajectories, well beyond the predominantly straight, forward-facing trajectories seen in conventional video data. To further enhance camera guidance, we introduce null-pitch conditioning, an annotation strategy that reduces the model's reliance on text content when conflicting with camera specifications (e.g., generating grass while the camera points towards the sky).

However, their reliability and robustness in real-world engineering domains remain largely unexplored, limiting their practical utility in human-centric workflows. In this work, we investigate the applicability and consistency of LLMs for analog circuit design -- a task requiring domain-specific reasoning, adherence to physical constraints, and structured representations -- focusing on AI-assisted design where humans remain in the loop. We study how different data representations influence model behavior and compare smaller models (e.g., T5, GPT-2) with larger foundation models (e.g., Mistral-7B, GPT-oss-20B) under varying training conditions. Our results highlight key reliability challenges, including sensitivity to data format, instability in generated designs, and limited generalization to unseen circuit configurations. These findings provide early evidence on the limits and potential of LLMs as tools to enhance human capabilities in complex engineering tasks, offering insights into designing reliable, deployable foundation models for structured, real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Such challenges occur in satellite remote sensing, but also with handheld cameras, such as our smartphones. Hence, super-resolution aims to enhance the image resolution algorithmically. Since single-image super-resolution requires solving an inverse problem, such methods must exploit strong priors, e.g. learned from high-resolution training data, or be constrained by auxiliary data, e.g. by a high-resolution guide from another modality. While qualitatively pleasing, such approaches often lead to \"hallucinated\" structures that do not match reality. In contrast, multi-image super-resolution (MISR) aims to improve the (optical) resolution by constraining the super-resolution process with multiple views taken with sub-pixel shifts. Here, we propose SuperF, a test-time optimization approach for MISR that leverages coordinate-based neural networks, also called neural fields. Their ability to represent continuous signals with an implicit neural representation (INR) makes them an ideal fit for the MISR task.\n  The key characteristic of our approach is to share an INR for multiple shifted low-resolution frames and to jointly optimize the frame alignment with the INR. Our approach advances related INR baselines, adopted from burst fusion for layer separation, by directly parameterizing the sub-pixel alignment as optimizable affine transformation parameters and by optimizing via a super-sampled coordinate grid that corresponds to the output resolution. Our experiments yield compelling results on simulated bursts of satellite imagery and ground-level images from handheld cameras, with upsampling factors of up to 8. A key advantage of SuperF is that this approach does not rely on any high-resolution training data.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We developed AngioAI-QFR, an end to end angiography only pipeline combining deep learning stenosis detection, lumen segmentation, centreline and diameter extraction, per millimetre Relative Flow Capacity profiling, and virtual stenting with automatic recomputation of angiography derived QFR. The system was evaluated in 100 consecutive vessels with invasive FFR as reference. Primary endpoints were agreement with FFR (correlation, mean absolute error) and diagnostic performance for FFR <= 0.80. On held out frames, stenosis detection achieved precision 0.97 and lumen segmentation Dice 0.78. Across 100 vessels, AngioAI-QFR correlated strongly with FFR (r = 0.89, MAE 0.045). The AUC for detecting FFR <= 0.80 was 0.93, with sensitivity 0.88 and specificity 0.86. The pipeline completed fully automatically in 93 percent of vessels, with median time to result 41 s.

However, these methods highly depend on label information to correctly recover ordinal relationships of features, limiting their applications to semi-supervised regression. In this work, we extend contrastive regression methods to allow unlabeled data to be used in the semi-supervised setting, thereby reducing the dependence on costly annotations. Particularly we construct the feature similarity matrix with both labeled and unlabeled samples in a mini-batch to reflect inter-sample relationships, and an accurate ordinal ranking of involved unlabeled samples can be recovered through spectral seriation algorithms if the level of error is within certain bounds. The introduction of labeled samples above provides regularization of the ordinal ranking with guidance from the ground-truth label information, making the ranking more reliable. To reduce feature perturbations, we further utilize the dynamic programming algorithm to select robust features for the matrix construction. The recovered ordinal relationship is then used for contrastive learning on unlabeled samples, and we thus allow more data to be used for feature representation learning, thereby achieving more robust results. The ordinal rankings can also be used to supervise predictions on unlabeled samples, serving as an additional training signal.

We initiate the study of such intent inference using a variant of a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF), subject to the assumption that the agent's intent manifests through closed-loop behavior with a state-of-the-art provable practical stability property. Leveraging the assumed closed-form agent dynamics, the RBPF analytically marginalizes the linear-Gaussian substructure and updates particle weights only, improving sample efficiency over a standard particle filter. Two difference estimators are introduced: a Gaussian mixture model using the RBPF weights and a reduced version confining the mixture to the effective sample. We quantify how well the adversary can recover the agent's intent using information-theoretic leakage metrics and provide computable lower bounds on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the true intent distribution and RBPF estimates via Gaussian-mixture KL bounds. We also provide a bound on the difference in performance between the two estimators, highlighting the fact that the reduced estimator performs almost as well as the complete one.

WonderZoom addresses this through two key innovations: (1) scale-adaptive Gaussian surfels for generating and real-time rendering of multi-scale 3D scenes, and (2) a progressive detail synthesizer that iteratively generates finer-scale 3D contents. Our approach enables users to \"zoom into\" a 3D region and auto-regressively synthesize previously non-existent fine details from landscapes to microscopic features.

Unlike classical continual learning where classes are disjoint, CCZSL is more complex as attributes and objects may reoccur across sessions while compositions remain unique. Built on a frozen VLM backbone, we propose the first Prompt-based Continual Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (PromptCCZSL) framework that retains prior knowledge through recency-weighted multi-teacher distillation. It employs session-aware compositional prompts to fuse multimodal features for new compositions, while attribute and object prompts are learned through session-agnostic fusion to maintain global semantic consistency, which is further stabilized by a Cosine Anchor Loss (CAL) to preserve prior knowledge. To enhance adaptation in the current session, an Orthogonal Projection Loss (OPL) ensures that new attribute and object embeddings remain distinct from previous ones, preventing overlap, while an Intra-Session Diversity Loss (IDL) promotes variation among current-session embeddings for richer, more discriminative representations. We also introduce a comprehensive protocol that jointly measures catastrophic forgetting and compositional generalization.

The acquired representations from SSL have demonstrated useful for many downstream tasks including clustering, and linear classification, etc. To ensure smoothness of the representation space, most SSL methods rely on the ability to generate pairs of observations that are similar to a given instance. However, generating these pairs may be challenging for many types of data. Moreover, these methods lack consideration of uncertainty quantification and can perform poorly in out-of-sample prediction settings. To address these limitations, we propose Gaussian process self supervised learning (GPSSL), a novel approach that utilizes Gaussian processes (GP) models on representation learning. GP priors are imposed on the representations, and we obtain a generalized Bayesian posterior minimizing a loss function that encourages informative representations. The covariance function inherent in GPs naturally pulls representations of similar units together, serving as an alternative to using explicitly defined positive samples. We show that GPSSL is closely related to both kernel PCA and VICReg, a popular neural network-based SSL method, but unlike both allows for posterior uncertainties that can be propagated to downstream tasks. Experiments on various datasets, considering classification and regression tasks, demonstrate that GPSSL outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy, uncertainty quantification, and error control.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While recent generative approaches have attempted to model progression, key mismatches remain: disease dynamics are inherently continuous and monotonic, yet latent representations are often scattered, lacking semantic structure, and diffusion-based models disrupt continuity with random denoising process. In this work, we propose to treat the disease dynamic as a velocity field and leverage Flow Matching (FM) to align the temporal evolution of patient data. Unlike prior methods, it captures the intrinsic dynamic of disease, making the progression more interpretable. However, a key challenge remains: in latent space, Auto-Encoders (AEs) do not guarantee alignment across patients or correlation with clinical-severity indicators (e.g., age and disease conditions). To address this, we propose to learn patient-specific latent alignment, which enforces patient trajectories to lie along a specific axis, with magnitude increasing monotonically with disease severity. This leads to a consistent and semantically meaningful latent space. Together, we present $\u0394$-LFM, a framework for modeling patient-specific latent progression with flow matching.

This is in part because high-quality annotated data are far more difficult to obtain for proteins than for natural language. We present a simple and general recipe for fast SFT of PLMs, designed to improve the fidelity, reliability, and novelty of generated protein sequences. Unlike existing approaches that require costly precompiled experimental datasets for SFT, our method leverages the PLM itself, integrating a lightweight curation pipeline with domain-specific filters to construct high-quality training data. These filters can independently refine a PLM's output and identify candidates for in vitro evaluation; when combined with SFT, they enable PLMs to generate more stable and functional enzymes, while expanding exploration into protein sequence space beyond natural variants. Although our approach is agnostic to both the choice of protein language model (PLM) and the protein system, we demonstrate its effectiveness with a genome-scale PLM (GenSLM) applied to the tryptophan synthase enzyme family.

Existing zero-shot approaches leverage 2D vision-language models (VLMs) by converting 3D spatial information (SI) into forms amenable to VLM processing, typically as composite inputs such as specified view renderings or video sequences with overlaid object markers. However, this VLM + SI paradigm yields entangled visual representations that compel the VLM to process entire cluttered cues, making it hard to exploit spatial semantic relationships effectively. In this work, we propose a new VLM x SI paradigm that externalizes the 3D SI into a form enabling the VLM to incrementally retrieve only what it needs during reasoning. We instantiate this paradigm with a novel View-on-Graph (VoG) method, which organizes the scene into a multi-modal, multi-layer scene graph and allows the VLM to operate as an active agent that selectively accesses necessary cues as it traverses the scene. This design offers two intrinsic advantages: (i) by structuring 3D context into a spatially and semantically coherent scene graph rather than confounding the VLM with densely entangled visual inputs, it lowers the VLM's reasoning difficulty; and (ii) by actively exploring and reasoning over the scene graph, it naturally produces transparent, step-by-step traces for interpretable 3DVG. Extensive experiments show that VoG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, establishing structured scene exploration as a promising strategy for advancing zero-shot 3DVG.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This study develops a forecasting framework that leverages the Construction Specifications Institute (CSI) MasterFormat as the target data structure, enabling predictions at the six-digit section level and supporting detailed cost projections across a wide spectrum of building materials. To enhance predictive accuracy, the framework integrates explanatory variables such as raw material prices, commodity indexes, and macroeconomic indicators. Four time-series models, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), and Chronos-Bolt, were evaluated under both baseline configurations (using CSI data only) and extended versions with explanatory variables. Results demonstrate that incorporating explanatory variables significantly improves predictive performance across all models.

However, existing MPI models face two major challenges. First, the scarcity of labeled molecule-protein pairs significantly limits model performance, as available datasets capture only a small fraction of biological relevant interactions. Second, most methods rely solely on molecular and protein features, ignoring broader biological context such as genes, metabolic pathways, and functional annotations that could provide essential complementary information. To address these limitations, our framework first aggregates diverse biological datasets, including molecular, protein, genes and pathway-level interactions, and then develop an optimal transport-based approach to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for unlabeled molecule-protein pairs, leveraging the underlying distribution of known interactions to guide label assignment. By treating pseudo-labeling as a mechanism for bridging disparate biological modalities, our approach enables the effective use of heterogeneous data to enhance MPI prediction. We evaluate our framework on multiple MPI datasets including virtual screening tasks and protein retrieval tasks, demonstrating substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracies and zero shot ability across unseen interactions.

For text-to-PSD generation, OmniPSD arranges multiple target layers spatially into a single canvas and learns their compositional relationships through spatial attention, producing semantically coherent and hierarchically structured layers. For image-to-PSD decomposition, it performs iterative in-context editing, progressively extracting and erasing textual and foreground components to reconstruct editable PSD layers from a single flattened image. An RGBA-VAE is employed as an auxiliary representation module to preserve transparency without affecting structure learning. Extensive experiments on our new RGBA-layered dataset demonstrate that OmniPSD achieves high-fidelity generation, structural consistency, and transparency awareness, offering a new paradigm for layered design generation and decomposition with diffusion transformers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is an effective strategy for enhancing safety at these urban junctures. Despite the growing popularity of Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods in optimizing TSC, these methods often prioritize driving efficiency over safety, thus failing to address the critical balance between these two aspects. Additionally, these methods usually need more interpretability. CounterFactual (CF) learning is a promising approach for various causal analysis fields. In this study, we introduce a novel framework to improve RL for safety aspects in TSC. This framework introduces a novel method based on CF learning to address the question: ``What if, when an unsafe event occurs, we backtrack to perform alternative actions, and will this unsafe event still occur in the subsequent period?'' To answer this question, we propose a new structure causal model to predict the result after executing different actions, and we propose a new CF module that integrates with additional ``X'' modules to promote safe RL practices. Our new algorithm, CFLight, which is derived from this framework, effectively tackles challenging safety events and significantly improves safety at intersections through a near-zero collision control strategy. Through extensive numerical experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that CFLight reduces collisions and improves overall traffic performance compared to conventional RL methods and the recent safe RL model. Moreover, our method represents a generalized and safe framework for RL methods, opening possibilities for applications in other domains.

When grounded on knowledge graphs (KGs), however, prevailing pipelines rely on heavy neural encoders to embed and score symbolic paths or on repeated LLM calls to rank candidates, leading to high latency, GPU cost, and opaque decisions that hinder faithful, scalable deployment. We propose PathHD, a lightweight and encoder-free KG reasoning framework that replaces neural path scoring with hyperdimensional computing (HDC) and uses only a single LLM call per query. PathHD encodes relation paths into block-diagonal GHRR hypervectors, ranks candidates with blockwise cosine similarity and Top-K pruning, and then performs a one-shot LLM adjudication to produce the final answer together with cited supporting paths. Technically, PathHD is built on three ingredients: (i) an order-aware, non-commutative binding operator for path composition, (ii) a calibrated similarity for robust hypervector-based retrieval, and (iii) a one-shot adjudication step that preserves interpretability while eliminating per-path LLM scoring. On WebQSP, CWQ, and the GrailQA split, PathHD (i) attains comparable or better Hits@1 than strong neural baselines while using one LLM call per query; (ii) reduces end-to-end latency by $40-60\\%$ and GPU memory by $3-5\\times$ thanks to encoder-free retrieval; and (iii) delivers faithful, path-grounded rationales that improve error diagnosis and controllability.

However, one of the major remaining challenges lies in modeling long-range motion-contained dynamic videos, where a naive extension of existing methods leads to severe memory explosion, temporal flickering, and failure to handle appearing or disappearing occlusions over time. To address these challenges, we propose a novel 4DGS framework characterized by an Anchor Relay-based Bidirectional Blending (ARBB) mechanism, named MoRel, which enables temporally consistent and memory-efficient modeling of long-range dynamic scenes. Our method progressively constructs locally canonical anchor spaces at key-frame time index and models inter-frame deformations at the anchor level, enhancing temporal coherence. By learning bidirectional deformations between KfA and adaptively blending them through learnable opacity control, our approach mitigates temporal discontinuities and flickering artifacts. We further introduce a Feature-variance-guided Hierarchical Densification (FHD) scheme that effectively densifies KfA's while keeping rendering quality, based on an assigned level of feature-variance. To effectively evaluate our model's capability to handle real-world long-range 4D motion, we newly compose long-range 4D motion-contained dataset, called SelfCap$_{\\text{LR}}$. It has larger average dynamic motion magnitude, captured at spatially wider spaces, compared to previous dynamic video datasets. Overall, our MoRel achieves temporally coherent and flicker-free long-range 4D reconstruction while maintaining bounded memory usage, demonstrating both scalability and efficiency in dynamic Gaussian-based representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoRel\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u951a\u70b9\u4e2d\u7ee7\u53cc\u5411\u6df7\u5408\u673a\u5236\u76844D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5185\u5b58\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u91cd\u5efa\u957f\u8303\u56f4\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u7206\u70b8\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u95ea\u70c1\u548c\u906e\u6321\u5904\u7406\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u76844D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u957f\u8303\u56f4\u52a8\u6001\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u5185\u5b58\u7206\u70b8\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u95ea\u70c1\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u906e\u6321\u51fa\u73b0\u6216\u6d88\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMoRel\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a1)\u951a\u70b9\u4e2d\u7ee7\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u6df7\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u65f6\u95f4\u7d22\u5f15\u5904\u6784\u5efa\u5c40\u90e8\u89c4\u8303\u951a\u70b9\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5efa\u6a21\u951a\u70b9\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u5e27\u95f4\u53d8\u5f62\uff1b2)\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u53d8\u5f62\u6df7\u5408\uff1b3)\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u81f4\u5bc6\u5316\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u81f4\u5bc6\u5316\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u951a\u70b9", "result": "\u5728\u65b0\u5efa\u7684\u957f\u8303\u56f44D\u52a8\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6SelfCap_LR\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0cMoRel\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u65e0\u95ea\u70c1\u7684\u957f\u8303\u56f44D\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e45\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u5bbd\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u8303\u56f4", "conclusion": "MoRel\u901a\u8fc7\u951a\u70b9\u4e2d\u7ee7\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u8303\u56f4\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u957f\u671f\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa"}}

To address these issues, in this letter, we propose a federated distillation-assisted vehicle edge caching scheme based on lightweight denoising diffusion probabilistic model (LDPM).

This inherent limitation hinders the development of long T2I evaluators, particularly in terms of the interpretability of alignment. In this study, we contribute LongT2IBench, which comprises 14K long text-image pairs accompanied by graph-structured human annotations. Given the detail-intensive nature of long prompts, we first design a Generate-Refine-Qualify annotation protocol to convert them into textual graph structures that encompass entities, attributes, and relations. Through this transformation, fine-grained alignment annotations are achieved based on these granular elements. Finally, the graph-structed annotations are converted into alignment scores and interpretations to facilitate the design of T2I evaluation models. Based on LongT2IBench, we further propose LongT2IExpert, a LongT2I evaluator that enables multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to provide both quantitative scores and structured interpretations through an instruction-tuning process with Hierarchical Alignment Chain-of-Thought (CoT).

To facilitate a more efficient and accessible diagnostic approach for PD, we propose a dynamic facial expression analysis-based PD auxiliary diagnosis method.

We develop a multimodal facial expression analysis network to extract expression intensity features during patients' performance of various facial expressions. This network leverages the CLIP architecture to integrate visual and textual features while preserving the temporal dynamics of facial expressions. Subsequently, the expression intensity features are processed and input into an LSTM-based classification network for PD diagnosis. Our method achieves an accuracy of 93.1%, outperforming other in-vitro PD diagnostic approaches.

While this line of work excels at reconstructing 3D geometry, the outputs are not colored 3D models, thus 3D colorization is required for visualization. Recent 3D colorization studies address this problem by distilling 2D image colorization models. However, these approaches suffer from an inherent inconsistency of 2D image models. This results in colors being averaged during training, leading to monotonous and oversimplified results, particularly in complex 360\u00b0 scenes. In contrast, we aim to preserve color diversity by generating a new set of consistently colorized training views, thereby bypassing the averaging process. Nevertheless, eliminating the averaging process introduces a new challenge: ensuring strict multi-view consistency across these colorized views. To achieve this, we propose LoGoColor, a pipeline designed to preserve color diversity by eliminating this guidance-averaging process with a `Local-Global' approach: we partition the scene into subscenes and explicitly tackle both inter-subscene and intra-subscene consistency using a fine-tuned multi-view diffusion model. We demonstrate that our method achieves quantitatively and qualitatively more consistent and plausible 3D colorization on complex 360\u00b0 scenes than existing methods, and validate its superior color diversity using a novel Color Diversity Index.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing regularizers are built on heterogeneous distance measures and design choices, which makes their behavior hard to reason about and their performance inconsistent across tasks. This raises a basic question: what properties make a good fairness regularizer? We address this question by first organizing existing in-process methods into three families: (i) matching prediction statistics across sensitive groups, (ii) aligning latent representations, and (iii) directly minimizing dependence between predictions and sensitive attributes. Through this lens, we identify desirable properties of the underlying distance measure, including tight generalization bounds, robustness to scale differences, and the ability to handle arbitrary prediction distributions. Motivated by these properties, we propose a Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) fairness regularizer that penalizes the empirical CS divergence between prediction distributions conditioned on sensitive groups. Under a Gaussian comparison, we show that CS divergence yields a tighter bound than Kullback-Leibler divergence, Maximum Mean Discrepancy, and the mean disparity used in Demographic Parity, and we discuss how these advantages translate to a distribution-free, kernel-based estimator that naturally extends to multiple sensitive attributes. Extensive experiments on four tabular benchmarks and one image dataset demonstrate that the proposed CS regularizer consistently improves Demographic Parity and Equal Opportunity metrics while maintaining competitive accuracy, and achieves a more stable utility-fairness trade-off across hyperparameter settings compared to prior regularizers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u67ef\u897f-\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u6563\u5ea6\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\uff08CS regularizer\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u7ec4\u95f4\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u96be\u4ee5\u7406\u89e3\u4e14\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7a76\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e2\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u969c\u53c8\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f52\u7eb3\u4e3a\u4e09\u7c7b\uff08\u5339\u914d\u9884\u6d4b\u7edf\u8ba1\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u3001\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7406\u60f3\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u8ddd\u79bb\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u91c7\u7528\u67ef\u897f-\u65bd\u74e6\u8328\u6563\u5ea6\uff08CS divergence\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u60e9\u7f5a\u4e0d\u540c\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u7ec4\u6761\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u8be5\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9ad8\u65af\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0cCS\u6563\u5ea6\u76f8\u6bd4KL\u6563\u5ea6\u3001\u6700\u5927\u5747\u503c\u5dee\u5f02\uff08MMD\uff09\u548c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff08Demographic Parity\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u5dee\u5f02\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u7d27\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u754c\u9650\u3002\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e00\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCS\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u673a\u4f1a\u5747\u7b49\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6548\u7528-\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "CS\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u4e25\u8c28\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6838\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7ec4\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5b83\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u754c\u9650\u7684\u7d27\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u591a\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u5df2\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, recent empirical results contradict this assumption: in some cases, imbalanced data distributions actually improve subgroup performance, while in others, subgroup performance remains unaffected by the absence of an entire subgroup during training. We conduct a systematic study of subgroup allocation across four vision and language models, varying training data composition to characterise the sensitivity of subgroup performance to data balance. We propose the latent separation hypothesis, which states that a partially fine-tuned model's dependence on subgroup representation is determined by the degree of separation between subgroups in the latent space of the pre-trained model. We formalise this hypothesis, provide theoretical analysis, and validate it empirically. Finally, we present a practical application to foundation model fine-tuning, demonstrating that quantitative analysis of latent subgroup separation can inform data collection and balancing decisions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing algorithms suffer from poor detection performance due to missing small target information, scale imbalance, and occlusion. We propose an improved YOLOv8n-SPTS model, which enhances the detection accuracy of small traffic targets through three key innovations: First, optimizing the feature extraction module. In the Backbone Bottleneck structure of YOLOv8n, 4 traditional convolution modules are replaced with Space-to-Depth Convolution (SPD-Conv) modules. This module retains fine-grained information through space-to-depth conversion, reduces information loss, and enhances the ability to capture features of low-resolution small targets. Second, enhancing feature fusion capability. The Spatial Pyramid Pooling - Fast Cross Stage Partial Connection (SPPFCSPC) module is introduced to replace the original SPPF module, integrating the multi-scale feature extraction from Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) and the feature fusion mechanism of Cross Stage Partial Connection (CSP), thereby improving the model's contextual understanding of complex scenes and multi-scale feature expression ability. Third, designing a dedicated detection structure for small targets. A Triple-Stage Feature Pyramid (TSFP) structure is proposed, which adds a 160*160 small target detection head to the original detection heads to fully utilize high-resolution features in shallow layers; meanwhile, redundant large target detection heads are removed to balance computational efficiency. Comparative experiments on the VisDrone2019-DET dataset show that YOLOv8n-SPTS model ranks first in precision (61.9%), recall (48.3%), mAP@0.5 (52.6%), and mAP@0.5:0.95 (32.6%).

While lightweight baseline models such as U-Net, U-Net++, and PraNet offer advantages in terms of easy deployment and low computational cost, they struggle to deal with the above issues, leading to limited segmentation performance. In contrast, large-scale vision foundation models such as SAM, DINOv2, OneFormer, and Mask2Former have exhibited impressive generalization performance across natural image domains. However, their direct transfer to medical imaging tasks (e.g., colonoscopic polyp segmentation) is not straightforward, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale datasets and lack of domain-specific knowledge. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel distillation framework, Polyp-DiFoM, that transfers the rich representations of foundation models into lightweight segmentation baselines, allowing efficient and accurate deployment in clinical settings. In particular, we infuse semantic priors from the foundation models into canonical architectures such as U-Net and U-Net++ and further perform frequency domain encoding for enhanced distillation, corroborating their generalization capability. Extensive experiments are performed across five benchmark datasets, such as Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ClinicDB, ETIS, ColonDB, and CVC-300.

This progress, however, raises pressing copyright concerns, as such models are often trained on vast corpora of artistic and commercial works. A central question is whether one can reliably verify if an artist's material was included in training, thereby providing a means for copyright holders to protect their content. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of such verification through membership inference attacks (MIA) on open-source generative audio models, which attempt to determine whether a specific audio sample was part of the training set. Our empirical results show that membership inference alone is of limited effectiveness at scale, as the per-sample membership signal is weak for models trained on large and diverse datasets. However, artists and media owners typically hold collections of works rather than isolated samples. Building on prior work in text and vision domains, in this work we focus on dataset inference (DI), which aggregates diverse membership evidence across multiple samples. We find that DI is successful in the audio domain, offering a more practical mechanism for assessing whether an artist's works contributed to model training. Our results suggest DI as a promising direction for copyright protection and dataset accountability in the era of large audio generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, modeling the listener is exceptionally challenging: direct audio-driven training fails, producing stiff, static listening motions. This failure stems from a fundamental imbalance: the speaker's motion is strongly driven by speech audio, while the listener's motion primarily follows an internal motion prior and is only loosely guided by external speech. This challenge has led most methods to focus on speak-only generation. The only prior attempt at joint generation relies on extra speaker's motion to produce the listener. This design is not end-to-end, thereby hindering the real-time applicability. To address this limitation, we present UniLS, the first end-to-end framework for generating unified speak-listen expressions, driven by only dual-track audio. Our method introduces a novel two-stage training paradigm. Stage 1 first learns the internal motion prior by training an audio-free autoregressive generator, capturing the spontaneous dynamics of natural facial motion. Stage 2 then introduces the dual-track audio, fine-tuning the generator to modulate the learned motion prior based on external speech cues. Extensive evaluations show UniLS achieves state-of-the-art speaking accuracy. More importantly, it delivers up to 44.1\\% improvement in listening metrics, generating significantly more diverse and natural listening expressions. This effectively mitigates the stiffness problem and provides a practical, high-fidelity audio-driven solution for interactive digital humans.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

By examining the boundary hyperplanes and the channel vectors of ReLU networks, we construct an example showing that equivariance constraints could strictly limit expressive power.

In this paper, we propose a 3DGS-based human avatar modeling framework, termed as Relightable and Dynamic Gaussian Avatar (RnD-Avatar), that presents accurate pose-variant deformation for high-fidelity geometrical details. To achieve this, we introduce dynamic skinning weights that define the human avatar's articulation based on pose while also learning additional deformations induced by body motion. We also introduce a novel regularization to capture fine geometric details under sparse visual cues.

Inspired by the BiIlluminant Dichromatic Reflection (BIDR) model, which suggests that a logarithmic transformation simplifies the separation of illumination and reflectance, we hypothesize that log RGB space enables NeRF to learn a more compact and effective representation of scene appearance. To test this, we captured approximately 30 videos using a GoPro camera, ensuring linear data recovery through inverse encoding. We trained NeRF models under various color space interpretations linear, sRGB, GPLog, and log RGB by converting each network output to a common color space before rendering and loss computation, enforcing representation learning in different color spaces. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that using a log RGB color space consistently improves rendering quality, exhibits greater robustness across scenes, and performs particularly well in low light conditions while using the same bit-depth input images. Further analysis across different network sizes and NeRF variants confirms the generalization and stability of the log space advantage.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing agents are typically confined to static, predefined action spaces--such as exclusively using APIs, GUI events, or robotic commands. This rigidity limits their adaptability in dynamic environments where the optimal granularity of interaction varies contextually. To bridge this gap, we propose CrossAgent, a unified agentic model that masters heterogeneous action spaces and autonomously selects the most effective interface for each step of a trajectory. We introduce a comprehensive training pipeline that integrates cold-start supervised fine-tuning with a Multi-Turn Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. This approach enables the agent to learn adaptive action switching--balancing high-level efficiency with low-level precision--without human-specified rules. Extensive experiments on over 800 tasks in the open-world Minecraft environment demonstrate that CrossAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance.

This inefficiency highlights a key limitation of the traditional process-then-reason paradigm, which analyzes visual streams exhaustively before semantic reasoning. To address this challenge, we introduce Video-QTR (Query-Driven Temporal Reasoning), a lightweight framework that redefines video comprehension as a query-guided reasoning process. Instead of encoding every frame, Video-QTR dynamically allocates perceptual resources based on the semantic intent of the query, creating an adaptive feedback loop between reasoning and perception. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks: MSVD-QA, Activity Net-QA, Movie Chat, and Video MME demonstrate that Video-QTR achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing input frame consumption by up to 73%.

Current methods struggle with generalization due to the scarce annotated 3D scene data or noisy 2D segmentations.

To address these needs, we propose an Adapted 3D Scene Synthesis pipeline for class-agnostic 3D Instance SegmenTation, termed as ASSIST-3D, to synthesize proper data for model generalization enhancement. Specifically, ASSIST-3D features three key innovations, including 1) Heterogeneous Object Selection from extensive 3D CAD asset collections, incorporating randomness in object sampling to maximize geometric and contextual diversity; 2) Scene Layout Generation through LLM-guided spatial reasoning combined with depth-first search for reasonable object placements; and 3) Realistic Point Cloud Construction via multi-view RGB-D image rendering and fusion from the synthetic scenes, closely mimicking real-world sensor data acquisition.

This paper demonstrates that by embedding detailed three-phase grid information--including phase voltages, unbalanced loads, and BESS states--into heterogeneous graph nodes, diverse GNN architectures (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, GPS) can jointly predict network state variables with high accuracy. Moreover, a physics-informed loss function incorporates critical battery constraints--SoC and C-rate limits--via soft penalties during training.

DivMorph factorizes randomly initialized Transformer weights into factor units via SVD prior to training and employs dynamic soft gating to modulate these units based on task and morphology embeddings, separating them into shared \\textit{learngenes} and morphology- and task-specific \\textit{tailors}, thereby achieving knowledge disentanglement. By selectively activating relevant components, DivMorph enables scalable and efficient policy deployment while supporting effective policy transfer to novel tasks.

On the other hand, Vision Transformers (ViTs), inspired by models originally created for language processing, use self-attention mechanisms, which allow them to understand relationships across the entire image. In this paper, we compare different types of ViTs (pure, hierarchical, and hybrid) against traditional CNN models across various tasks, including object recognition, detection, and medical image classification. We conduct thorough tests on standard datasets like ImageNet for image classification and COCO for object detection. Additionally, we apply these models to medical imaging using the ChestX-ray14 dataset. We find that hybrid and hierarchical transformers, especially Swin and CvT, offer a strong balance between accuracy and computational resources. Furthermore, by experimenting with data augmentation techniques on medical images, we discover significant performance improvements, particularly with the Swin Transformer model.

In parallel, new embedded software building blocks are more and more written in Rust, while C/C++ dominance fades in this domain.

In this context, both incremental improvements and novel innovative services will have to be continuously retrofitted using ANNs execution in software embedded on sensing/actuating systems already deployed in the field. However, there was so far no Rust embedded software platform automating parallelization for inference computation on multi-core MCUs executing arbitrary TinyML models. This paper thus fills this gap by introducing Ariel-ML, a novel toolkit we designed combining a generic TinyML pipeline and an embedded Rust software platform which can take full advantage of multi-core capabilities of various 32bit microcontroller families (Arm Cortex-M, RISC-V, ESP-32). We published the full open source code of its implementation, which we used to benchmark its capabilities using a zoo of various TinyML models. We show that Ariel-ML outperforms prior art in terms of inference latency as expected, and we show that, compared to pre-existing toolkits using embedded C/C++, Ariel-ML achieves comparable memory footprints.

The current research introduces novel approaches for constructing fair k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and fair epsilon-neighborhood graphs that proactively enforce demographic parity during graph formation. By incorporating fairness constraints at the earliest stage of neighborhood selection steps, our approaches incorporate proportional representation of sensitive features into the local graph structure while maintaining geometric consistency.Our work addresses a critical gap in pre-processing for fair spectral clustering, demonstrating that topological fairness in graph construction is essential for achieving equitable clustering outcomes. Widely used graph construction methods like kNN and epsilon-neighborhood graphs propagate edge based disparate impact on sensitive groups, leading to biased clustering results. Providing representation of each sensitive group in the neighborhood of every node leads to fairer spectral clustering results because the topological features of the graph naturally reflect equitable group ratios. This research fills an essential shortcoming in fair unsupervised learning, by illustrating how topological fairness in graph construction inherently facilitates fairer spectral clustering results without the need for changes to the clustering algorithm itself. Thorough experiments on three synthetic datasets, seven real-world tabular datasets, and three real-world image datasets prove that our fair graph construction methods surpass the current baselines in graph clustering tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u516c\u5e73K\u8fd1\u90bb\u56fe\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u03b5\u90bb\u57df\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u5f62\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9636\u6bb5\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b9e\u65bd\u7fa4\u4f53\u7edf\u8ba1\u5747\u7b49\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u516c\u5e73\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u62d3\u6251\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u56fe\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\uff09\u56e0\u4e0d\u516c\u6b63\u7684\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u5f0f\u53ef\u80fd\u4f7f\u67d0\u4e9b\u7fa4\u4f53\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u4f20\u9012\u504f\u89c1\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982kNN\u548c\u56fe\u90bb\u57df\u56fe\u4f1a\u5728\u654f\u611f\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u4f20\u64ad\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fb9\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u5f85\u9047\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6709\u504f\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "method": "1. \u5728\u90bb\u57df\u9009\u62e9\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u6700\u65e9\u9636\u6bb5\u52a0\u5165\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b2. \u5c06\u654f\u611f\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u8868\u793a\u7eb3\u5165\u5c40\u90e8\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff1b3. \u4fdd\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b4. \u6784\u5efa\u516c\u5e73kNN\u56fe\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u03b5\u90bb\u57df\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u4e03\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5168\u9762\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u516c\u5e73\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u805a\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u516c\u5e73\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7f3a\u53e3\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u8c31\u805a\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u6539\u53d8\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u672c\u8eab\u3002\u62d3\u6251\u516c\u5e73\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b0\u516c\u5e73\u805a\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002"}}

Our key idea is to generate cross-view consistent image pairs that are well-aligned with the source and target point clouds, enabling geometry-color feature fusion to facilitate robust matching. To ensure high-quality matching, the generated image pair should feature both 2D-3D geometric consistency and cross-view texture consistency. To achieve this, we introduce Match-ControlNet, a matching-specific, controllable 2D generative model. Specifically, it leverages the depth-conditioned generation capability of ControlNet to produce images that are geometrically aligned with depth maps derived from point clouds, ensuring 2D-3D geometric consistency. Additionally, by incorporating a coupled conditional denoising scheme and coupled prompt guidance, Match-ControlNet further promotes cross-view feature interaction, guiding texture consistency generation. Our generative 3D registration paradigm is general and could be seamlessly integrated into various registration methods to enhance their performance.

However, these models typically build on lengthy reasoning chains and large numbers of input visual tokens. Motivated by empirical observations from our benchmark study, we hypothesize that concise reasoning combined with a reduced set of visual tokens can be sufficient for effective video reasoning. To evaluate this hypothesis, we design and validate an efficient post-training and inference framework that enhances a video MLLM's reasoning capability. Our framework enables models to operate on compressed visual tokens and generate brief reasoning traces prior to answering. The resulting models achieve substantially improved inference efficiency, deliver competitive performance across diverse benchmarks, and avoid reliance on manual CoT annotations or supervised fine-tuning. Collectively, our results suggest that long, human-like CoT reasoning may not be necessary for general video reasoning, and that concise reasoning can be both effective and efficient.

These fires cause massive destruction to both property and human life. Because of these reasons, there's a growing need for accurate and practical predictions that can help assist with resources allocation for the Wildfire managers or the response teams. In this research, we built machine learning models to predict the number of days it will require to fully contain a wildfire in California. Here, we addressed an important gap in the current literature. Most prior research has concentrated on wildfire risk or how fires spread, and the few that examine the duration typically predict it in broader categories rather than a continuous measure. This research treats the wildfire duration prediction as a regression task, which allows for more detailed and precise forecasts rather than just the broader categorical predictions used in prior work. We built the models by combining three publicly available datasets from California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection's Fire and Resource Assessment Program (FRAP). This study compared the performance of baseline ensemble regressor, Random Forest and XGBoost, with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The results show that the XGBoost model slightly outperforms the Random Forest model, likely due to its superior handling of static features in the dataset. The LSTM model, on the other hand, performed worse than the ensemble models because the dataset lacked temporal features. Overall, this study shows that, depending on the feature availability, Wildfire managers or Fire management authorities can select the most appropriate model to accurately predict wildfire containment duration and allocate resources effectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Due to the lack of ground-truth paired swapping data, prior methods typically train on cross-frame pairs of the same person within a video and rely on mask-based inpainting to mitigate identity leakage. Beyond potential boundary artifacts, this paradigm struggles to recover essential cues occluded by the mask, such as facial pose, expressions, and motion dynamics. To address these issues, we prompt a video editing model to synthesize new heads for existing videos as fake swapping inputs, while maintaining frame-synchronized facial poses and expressions. This yields HeadSwapBench, the first cross-identity paired dataset for video head swapping, which supports both training (\\TrainNum{} videos) and benchmarking (\\TestNum{} videos) with genuine outputs. Leveraging this paired supervision, we propose DirectSwap, a mask-free, direct video head-swapping framework that extends an image U-Net into a video diffusion model with a motion module and conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce the Motion- and Expression-Aware Reconstruction (MEAR) loss, which reweights the diffusion loss per pixel using frame-difference magnitudes and facial-landmark proximity, thereby enhancing cross-frame coherence in motion and expressions.

Through the adoption of CP, we bridge the regret-minimising potential of a decision-making bandit policy with statistical guarantees in the form of finite-time prediction coverage.\n  We demonstrate the potential of it Conformal Bandits through simulation studies and an application to portfolio allocation, a typical small-gap regime, where differences in arm rewards are far too small for classical policies to achieve optimal regret bounds in finite sample. Motivated by this, we showcase our framework's practical advantage in terms of regret in small-gap settings, as well as its added value in achieving nominal coverage guarantees where classical UCB policies fail. Focusing on our application of interest, we further illustrate how integrating hidden Markov models to capture the regime-switching behaviour of financial markets, enhances the exploration-exploitation trade-off, and translates into higher risk-adjusted regret efficiency returns, while preserving coverage guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We propose the Motion Conditioned Diffusion Model (MCDM), a label-free latent diffusion framework that synthesises realistic echocardiography videos conditioned on self-supervised motion features. To extract these features, we design the Motion and Appearance Feature Extractor (MAFE), which disentangles motion and appearance representations from videos. Feature learning is further enhanced by two auxiliary objectives: a re-identification loss guided by pseudo appearance features and an optical flow loss guided by pseudo flow fields. Evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, MCDM achieves competitive video generation performance, producing temporally coherent and clinically realistic sequences without reliance on manual labels. These results demonstrate the potential of self-supervised conditioning for scalable echocardiography synthesis.

However, the growing scale of echocardiographic video data presents significant challenges in terms of storage, computation, and model training efficiency. Dataset distillation offers a promising solution by synthesizing a compact, informative subset of data that retains the key clinical features of the original dataset. In this work, we propose a novel approach for distilling a compact synthetic echocardiographic video dataset. Our method leverages motion feature extraction to capture temporal dynamics, followed by class-wise graph construction and representative sample selection using the Infomap algorithm.

Roughly, this means that a matrix formed by the model's log probabilities of various tokens conditioned on certain sequences of tokens is well approximated by a low rank matrix.\n  In this paper, our focus is on understanding how this structure can be exploited algorithmically for obtaining provable learning guarantees. Since low logit rank models can encode hard-to-learn distributions such as noisy parities, we study a query learning model with logit queries that reflects the access model for common APIs. Our main result is an efficient algorithm for learning any approximately low logit rank model from queries. We emphasize that our structural assumption closely reflects the behavior that is empirically observed in modern language models. Thus, our result gives what we believe is the first end-to-end learning guarantee for a generative model that plausibly captures modern language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u67e5\u8be2\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4f4elogit\u79e9\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u5728API\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u83b7\u53d6\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u9996\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u4f46\u7ecf\u9a8c\u89c2\u5bdf\u663e\u793a\u5b83\u4eec\u5177\u6709\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4f4elogit\u79e9\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u7ed3\u6784\u7b97\u6cd5\u5316\u5730\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728API\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f4elogit\u79e9\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7logit\u67e5\u8be2\uff08\u53cd\u6620\u5e38\u89c1API\u7684\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u6b64\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u4ece\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u4f55\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4f4elogit\u79e9\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u4f55\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4f4elogit\u79e9\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u6b21\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u6027\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b66\u4e60\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u89c2\u5bdf\u7279\u6027\uff08\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4f4elogit\u79e9\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0a\u88ab\u5229\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645API\u8bbf\u95ee\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

However, existing methods either rely on implicit part segmentation with limited granularity control or depend on strong external segmenters trained on large annotated datasets. In this work, we observe that part awareness emerges naturally during whole-object geometry learning and propose Geom-Seg VecSet, a unified geometry-segmentation latent representation that jointly encodes object geometry and part-level structure. Building on this representation, we introduce UniPart, a two-stage latent diffusion framework for image-guided part-level 3D generation.

We introduce Bind & Compose, a one-shot method that enables flexible visual concept composition by binding visual concepts with corresponding prompt tokens and composing the target prompt with bound tokens from various sources. It adopts a hierarchical binder structure for cross-attention conditioning in Diffusion Transformers to encode visual concepts into corresponding prompt tokens for accurate decomposition of complex visual concepts. To improve concept-token binding accuracy, we design a Diversify-and-Absorb Mechanism that uses an extra absorbent token to eliminate the impact of concept-irrelevant details when training with diversified prompts. To enhance the compatibility between image and video concepts, we present a Temporal Disentanglement Strategy that decouples the training process of video concepts into two stages with a dual-branch binder structure for temporal modeling. Evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves superior concept consistency, prompt fidelity, and motion quality over existing approaches, opening up new possibilities for visual creativity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, these models often neglect fine-grained details, such as which kind of anomalies, like \"hole\", \"cut\", \"scratch\" that could provide more specific insight into the nature of anomalies. We argue that recognizing fine-grained anomaly types 1) enriches the representation of \"abnormal\" with structured semantics, narrowing the gap between coarse anomaly signals and fine-grained defect categories; 2) enables manufacturers to understand the root causes of the anomaly and implement more targeted and appropriate corrective measures quickly. While incorporating such detailed semantic information is crucial, designing handcrafted prompts for each defect type is both time-consuming and susceptible to human bias. For this reason, we introduce DAPO, a novel approach for Defect-aware Prompt Optimization based on progressive tuning for the zero-shot multi-type and binary anomaly detection and segmentation under distribution shifts. Our approach aligns anomaly-relevant image features with their corresponding text semantics by learning hybrid defect-aware prompts with both fixed textual anchors and learnable token embeddings. We conducted experiments on public benchmarks (MPDD, VisA, MVTec-AD, MAD, and Real-IAD) and an internal dataset. The results suggest that compared to the baseline models, DAPO achieves a 3.7% average improvement in AUROC and average precision metrics at the image level under distribution shift, and a 6.5% average improvement in localizing novel anomaly types under zero-shot settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DAPO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9010\u6b65\u8c03\u4f18\u751f\u6210\u7f3a\u9677\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u591a\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u4e8c\u5143\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5206\u5272\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5f02\u5e38\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u5982\u5b54\u6d1e\u3001\u5207\u53e3\u3001\u5212\u75d5\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u6027\u8d28\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5236\u9020\u5546\u7406\u89e3\u5f02\u5e38\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u5e76\u5b9e\u65bd\u66f4\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u7ea0\u6b63\u63aa\u65bd\u3002\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7f3a\u9677\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u65e2\u8017\u65f6\u53c8\u6613\u53d7\u4eba\u4e3a\u4e3b\u89c2\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "DAPO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9010\u6b65\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5f02\u5e38\u76f8\u5173\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5bf9\u5e94\u6587\u672c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56fa\u5b9a\u6587\u672c\u951a\u70b9\u548c\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6807\u8bb0\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u6df7\u5408\u7f3a\u9677\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\uff08MPDD\u3001VisA\u3001MVTec-AD\u3001MAD\u3001Real-IAD\uff09\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0cDAPO\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7AUROC\u548c\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53473.7%\uff0c\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u9488\u5bf9\u65b0\u5f02\u5e38\u7c7b\u578b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53476.5%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5f02\u5e38\u7c7b\u578b\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u4e1a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5feb\u901f\u8bc6\u522b\u5f02\u5e38\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, their training on sensitive patient data raises critical privacy and compliance challenges under regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR, which enforce the \"right to be forgotten\". Unlearning, the process of tuning models to selectively remove the influence of specific training data points, offers a potential solution, yet its effectiveness in complex medical settings remains underexplored. To systematically study this, we introduce MedForget, a Hierarchy-Aware Multimodal Unlearning Testbed with explicit retain and forget splits and evaluation sets containing rephrased variants. MedForget models hospital data as a nested hierarchy (Institution -> Patient -> Study -> Section), enabling fine-grained assessment across eight organizational levels. The benchmark contains 3840 multimodal (image, question, answer) instances, each hierarchy level having a dedicated unlearning target, reflecting distinct unlearning challenges. Experiments with four SOTA unlearning methods on three tasks (generation, classification, cloze) show that existing methods struggle to achieve complete, hierarchy-aware forgetting without reducing diagnostic performance. To test whether unlearning truly deletes hierarchical pathways, we introduce a reconstruction attack that progressively adds hierarchical level context to prompts.

Compared to traditional MPC procedures, which rely on slow search algorithms or on iteratively solving optimization problems exactly, gradient-based planning offers a computationally efficient alternative. However, the performance of gradient-based planning has thus far lagged behind that of other approaches. In this paper, we propose improved methods for training world models that enable efficient gradient-based planning. We begin with the observation that although a world model is trained on a next-state prediction objective, it is used at test-time to instead estimate a sequence of actions. The goal of our work is to close this train-test gap. To that end, we propose train-time data synthesis techniques that enable significantly improved gradient-based planning with existing world models.

Multispectral images (MSIs) capture additional spectral cues across multiple bands, offering a promising alternative. However, the lack of training data has been the primary bottleneck to exploiting the potential of MSIs. To address this gap, we introduce the first large-scale dataset for Multispectral Object Detection in Aerial images (MODA), which comprises 14,041 MSIs and 330,191 annotations across diverse, challenging scenarios, providing a comprehensive data foundation for this field. Furthermore, to overcome challenges inherent to aerial object detection using MSIs, we propose OSSDet, a framework that integrates spectral and spatial information with object-aware cues.

However, these models often produce textual descriptions that contradict their final quality predictions, and the predicted scores can change unstably during inference - behaviors not aligned with human reasoning. To understand these issues, we analyze the factors that cause contradictory assessments and instability. We first estimate the relationship between the final quality predictions and the generated visual features, finding that the predictions are not fully grounded in the features and that the logical connection between them is weak. Moreover, decoding intermediate VLM layers shows that the model frequently relies on a limited set of candidate tokens, which contributes to prediction instability. To encourage more human-like reasoning, we introduce a two-stage tuning method that explicitly separates visual perception from quality inference. In the first stage, the model learns visual features; in the second, it infers quality solely from these features. Experiments on SPAQ and KONIQ demonstrate that our approach reduces prediction instability from 22.00% to 12.39% and achieves average gains of 0.3124/0.3507 in SRCC/PLCC across LIVE, CSIQ, SPAQ, and KONIQ compared to the baseline.

However, despite their strong visual perception modules, these models often fail to reliably detect basic low-level distortions such as blur, noise, and compression, and may produce inconsistent evaluations across repeated inferences. This raises an essential question: do MLLM-based IQA systems truly perceive the visual features that matter? To examine this issue, we introduce a low-level distortion perception task that requires models to classify specific distortion types. Our component-wise analysis shows that although MLLMs are structurally capable of representing such distortions, they tend to overfit training templates, leading to biases in quality scoring. As a result, critical low-level features are weakened or lost during the vision-language alignment transfer stage. Furthermore, by computing the semantic distance between visual features and corresponding semantic tokens before and after component-wise fine-tuning, we show that improving the alignment of the vision encoder dramatically enhances distortion recognition accuracy, increasing it from 14.92% to 84.43%. Overall, these findings indicate that incorporating dedicated constraints on the vision encoder can strengthen text-explainable visual representations and enable MLLM-based pipelines to produce more coherent and interpretable reasoning in vision-centric tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This study presents a robust and scalable modeling system for estimating soil properties in croplands, including soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P), exchangeable potassium (K), and pH, using remote sensing data and environmental covariates. The system employs a hybrid modeling approach, combining the indirect methods of modeling soil through proxies and drivers with direct spectral modeling. We extend current approaches by using interpretable physics-informed covariates derived from radiative transfer models (RTMs) and complex, nonlinear embeddings from a foundation model. We validate the system on a harmonized dataset that covers Europes cropland soils across diverse pedoclimatic zones. Evaluation is conducted under a robust validation framework that enforces strict spatial blocking, stratified splits, and statistically distinct train-test sets, which deliberately make the evaluation harder and produce more realistic error estimates for unseen regions. The models achieved their highest accuracy for SOC and N. This performance held across unseen locations, under both spatial cross-validation and an independent test set. SOC obtained a MAE of 5.12 g/kg and a CCC of 0.77, and N obtained a MAE of 0.44 g/kg and a CCC of 0.77. We also assess uncertainty through conformal calibration, achieving 90 percent coverage at the target confidence level.

Existing approaches mainly rely on uniform pixel-wise color mapping across entire images, neglecting the inherent color variations induced by image content. This limitation hinders existing approaches from achieving adaptive retouching that accommodates both diverse color distributions and user-defined style preferences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Content-Adaptive image retouching method guided by Attribute-based Text Representation (CA-ATP). Specifically, we propose a content-adaptive curve mapping module, which leverages a series of basis curves to establish multiple color mapping relationships and learns the corresponding weight maps, enabling content-aware color adjustments. The proposed module can capture color diversity within the image content, allowing similar color values to receive distinct transformations based on their spatial context. In addition, we propose an attribute text prediction module that generates text representations from multiple image attributes, which explicitly represent user-defined style preferences.

We present UnReflectAnything, an RGB-only framework that removes highlights from a single image by predicting a highlight map together with a reflection-free diffuse reconstruction. The model uses a frozen vision transformer encoder to extract multi-scale features, a lightweight head to localize specular regions, and a token-level inpainting module that restores corrupted feature patches before producing the final diffuse image. To overcome the lack of paired supervision, we introduce a Virtual Highlight Synthesis pipeline that renders physically plausible specularities using monocular geometry, Fresnel-aware shading, and randomized lighting which enables training on arbitrary RGB images with correct geometric structure. UnReflectAnything generalizes across natural and surgical domains where non-Lambertian surfaces and non-uniform lighting create severe highlights and it achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks.

Nowadays, event cameras are becoming more widely adopted as they surpass RGB cameras in capturing facial expression changes due to their high temporal resolution, low latency, computational efficiency, and robustness in low-light conditions. Despite these advantages, event-based approaches still encounter practical challenges, particularly in adopting mainstream deep learning models. Traditional deep learning methods for facial expression analysis are energy-intensive, making them difficult to deploy on edge computing devices and thereby increasing costs, especially for high-frequency, dynamic, event vision-based approaches. To address this challenging issue, we proposed the CS3D framework by decomposing the Convolutional 3D method to reduce the computational complexity and energy consumption. Additionally, by utilizing soft spiking neurons and a spatial-temporal attention mechanism, the ability to retain information is enhanced, thus improving the accuracy of facial expression detection.

However, compared to meshes or radiance fields, existing multiview diffusion models offer limited appearance manipulation, particularly in terms of material, texture, or style.\n  In this paper, we present a lightweight adaptation technique for appearance transfer in multiview diffusion models. Our method learns to combine object identity from an input image with appearance cues rendered in a separate reference image, producing multi-view-consistent output that reflects the desired materials, textures, or styles. This allows explicit specification of appearance parameters at generation time while preserving the underlying object geometry and view coherence. We leverage three diffusion denoising processes responsible for generating the original object, the reference, and the target images, and perform reverse sampling to aggregate a small subset of layer-wise self-attention features from the object and the reference to influence the target generation. Our method requires only a few training examples to introduce appearance awareness to pretrained multiview models. The experiments show that our method provides a simple yet effective way toward multiview generation with diverse appearance, advocating the adoption of implicit generative 3D representations in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our research concentrates on a fundamental sub-problem: the fine-grained classification of atomic interaction states, namely 'approaching', 'grabbing', and 'holding'. To this end, we introduce a structured data engineering process that converts raw videos from the MANIAC dataset into 27,476 statistical-kinematic feature vectors. Each vector encapsulates relational and dynamic properties from a short temporal window of motion. Our initial hypothesis posited that sequential modeling would be critical, leading us to compare static classifiers (MLPs) against temporal models (RNNs). Counter-intuitively, the key discovery occurred when we set the sequence length of a Bidirectional RNN to one (seq_length=1). This modification converted the network's function, compelling it to act as a high-capacity static feature encoder. This architectural change directly led to a significant accuracy improvement, culminating in a final score of 97.60%. Of particular note, our optimized model successfully overcame the most challenging transitional class, 'grabbing', by achieving a balanced F1-score of 0.90.

This leads to projects that rely on ad-hoc toolchains that are hard to reproduce, difficult to scale beyond single institutions and poorly suited for collaboration between clinicians and data scientists. We present Kaapana, a comprehensive open-source platform for medical imaging research that is designed to bridge this gap. Rather than building single-use, site-specific tooling, Kaapana provides a modular, extensible framework that unifies data ingestion, cohort curation, processing workflows and result inspection under a common user interface. By bringing the algorithm to the data, it enables institutions to keep control over their sensitive data while still participating in distributed experimentation and model development. By integrating flexible workflow orchestration with user-facing applications for researchers, Kaapana reduces technical overhead, improves reproducibility and enables conducting large-scale, collaborative, multi-centre imaging studies. We describe the core concepts of the platform and illustrate how they can support diverse use cases, from local prototyping to nation-wide research networks.

Incorporating controllability in video generation further adds to the complexity. Existing controllable video generation approaches face a trade-off: sparse controls like keypoint trajectories are easy to specify but lack instance-awareness, while dense signals such as optical flow, depths or 3D meshes are informative but costly to obtain. We propose VHOI, a two-stage framework that first densifies sparse trajectories into HOI mask sequences, and then fine-tunes a video diffusion model conditioned on these dense masks. We introduce a novel HOI-aware motion representation that uses color encodings to distinguish not only human and object motion, but also body-part-specific dynamics. This design incorporates a human prior into the conditioning signal and strengthens the model's ability to understand and generate realistic HOI dynamics. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results in controllable HOI video generation. VHOI is not limited to interaction-only scenarios and can also generate full human navigation leading up to object interactions in an end-to-end manner.

However, their capability in understanding infrared images remains unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce IF-Bench, the first high-quality benchmark designed for evaluating multimodal understanding of infrared images. IF-Bench consists of 499 images sourced from 23 infrared datasets and 680 carefully curated visual question-answer pairs, covering 10 essential dimensions of image understanding. Based on this benchmark, we systematically evaluate over 40 open-source and closed-source MLLMs, employing cyclic evaluation, bilingual assessment, and hybrid judgment strategies to enhance the reliability of the results. Our analysis reveals how model scale, architecture, and inference paradigms affect infrared image comprehension, providing valuable insights for this area. Furthermore, we propose a training-free generative visual prompting (GenViP) method, which leverages advanced image editing models to translate infrared images into semantically and spatially aligned RGB counterparts, thereby mitigating domain distribution shifts.

However, previous studies show that generated images often resemble the training data, and this problem becomes more severe as the model size increases. Memorizing training data can lead to legal challenges, including copyright infringement, violations of portrait rights, and trademark violations. Existing approaches to mitigating memorization mainly focus on manipulating the denoising sampling process to steer image embeddings away from the memorized embedding space or employ unlearning methods that require training on datasets containing specific sets of memorized concepts. However, existing methods often incur substantial computational overhead during sampling, or focus narrowly on removing one or more groups of target concepts, imposing a significant limitation on their scalability. To understand and mitigate these problems, our work, UniForget, offers a new perspective on understanding the root cause of memorization.

Existing state-of-the-art methods often rely on iterative Perspective-n-Point (PnP)-based algorithms, which are computationally intensive and ill-suited for real-time deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To overcome these limitations, we propose FastPose-ViT, a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architecture that directly regresses the 6DoF pose. Our approach processes cropped images from object bounding boxes and introduces a novel mathematical formalism to map these localized predictions back to the full-image scale. This formalism is derived from the principles of projective geometry and the concept of \"apparent rotation\", where the model predicts an apparent rotation matrix that is then corrected to find the true orientation. We demonstrate that our method outperforms other non-PnP strategies and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art PnP-based techniques on the SPEED dataset. Furthermore, we validate our model's suitability for real-world space missions by quantizing it and deploying it on power-constrained edge hardware.

However, existing SSL approaches for multi-modal medical imaging often struggle to exploit the complementary information between modalities due to semantic discrepancies and misalignment across MRI sequences. To address this, we propose a novel semi-supervised multi-modal framework that explicitly enhances modality-specific representations and facilitates adaptive cross-modal information fusion. Specifically, we introduce a Modality-specific Enhancing Module (MEM) to strengthen semantic cues unique to each modality via channel-wise attention, and a learnable Complementary Information Fusion (CIF) module to adaptively exchange complementary knowledge between modalities. The overall framework is optimized using a hybrid objective combining supervised segmentation loss and cross-modal consistency regularization on unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2019 (HGG subset) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong semi-supervised and multi-modal baselines under 1\\%, 5\\%, and 10\\% labeled data settings, achieving significant improvements in both Dice and Sensitivity scores.

A prominent interest pertains to the integration of an image prompt adapter to facilitate zero-shot PT2I without test-time fine-tuning. However, current methods grapple with three fundamental challenges: 1. the elusive equilibrium between Concept Preservation (CP) and Prompt Following (PF), 2. the difficulty in retaining fine-grained concept details in reference images, and 3. the restricted scalability to extend to multi-subject personalization. To tackle these challenges, we present Dynamic Image Prompt Adapter (DynaIP), a cutting-edge plugin to enhance the fine-grained concept fidelity, CP-PF balance, and subject scalability of SOTA T2I multimodal diffusion transformers (MM-DiT) for PT2I generation. Our key finding is that MM-DiT inherently exhibit decoupling learning behavior when injecting reference image features into its dual branches via cross attentions. Based on this, we design an innovative Dynamic Decoupling Strategy that removes the interference of concept-agnostic information during inference, significantly enhancing the CP-PF balance and further bolstering the scalability of multi-subject compositions. Moreover, we identify the visual encoder as a key factor affecting fine-grained CP and reveal that the hierarchical features of commonly used CLIP can capture visual information at diverse granularity levels. Therefore, we introduce a novel Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts Feature Fusion Module to fully leverage the hierarchical features of CLIP, remarkably elevating the fine-grained concept fidelity while also providing flexible control of visual granularity.

Existing vision-language-action (VLA)-based methods cannot leverage unlabeled videos for visual causal learning, while world model-based methods lack reasoning capabilities from large language models. In this paper, we construct multiple specialized datasets providing reasoning and planning annotations for complex scenarios. Then, a unified Understanding-Generation-Planning framework, named UniUGP, is proposed to synergize scene reasoning, future video generation, and trajectory planning through a hybrid expert architecture. By integrating pre-trained VLMs and video generation models, UniUGP leverages visual dynamics and semantic reasoning to enhance planning performance.

The critical challenges are how to model the spectral prior distribution and spectral variability. Prior knowledge and spectral variability can be rigorously modeled under the Bayesian framework, where posterior estimation of Abundance is derived by combining observed data with endmember prior distribution. Considering the key challenges and the advantages of the Bayesian framework, a novel method using a diffusion posterior sampler for semiblind unmixing, denoted as DPS4Un, is proposed to deal with these challenges with the following features: (1) we view the pretrained conditional spectrum diffusion model as a posterior sampler, which can combine the learned endmember prior with observation to get the refined abundance distribution. (2) Instead of using the existing spectral library as prior, which may raise bias, we establish the image-based endmember bundles within superpixels, which are used to train the endmember prior learner with diffusion model. Superpixels make sure the sub-scene is more homogeneous. (3) Instead of using the image-level data consistency constraint, the superpixel-based data fidelity term is proposed. (4) The endmember is initialized as Gaussian noise for each superpixel region, DPS4Un iteratively updates the abundance and endmember, contributing to spectral variability modeling. The experimental results on three real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that DPS4Un outperforms the state-of-the-art hyperspectral unmixing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A key methodological contribution is pioneering LLM-as-a-judge for semantic formula assessment, combined with a robust two-stage matching pipeline that handles parser output inconsistencies. Through human validation on 250 formula pairs (750 ratings from 30 evaluators), we demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation achieves substantially higher correlation with human judgment (Pearson r=0.78) compared to CDM (r=0.34) and text similarity (r~0). Evaluating 20+ contemporary PDF parsers (including specialized OCR models, vision-language models, and rule-based approaches) across 100 synthetic documents with 2,000+ formulas reveals significant performance disparities.

This direction offers efficient rendering and seamless integration with diffusion-based pipelines. However, these methods face a fundamental limitation: The VAE latent space lacks multi-view consistency, leading to blurred textures and missing details during 3D reconstruction. Existing approaches attempt to address this by fine-tuning the VAE, at the cost of reconstruction quality, or by relying on pre-trained diffusion models to recover fine-grained details, at the risk of some hallucinations. We present Splatent, a diffusion-based enhancement framework designed to operate on top of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in the latent space of VAEs. Our key insight departs from the conventional 3D-centric view: rather than reconstructing fine-grained details in 3D space, we recover them in 2D from input views through multi-view attention mechanisms. This approach preserves the reconstruction quality of pretrained VAEs while achieving faithful detail recovery. Evaluated across multiple benchmarks, Splatent establishes a new state-of-the-art for VAE latent radiance field reconstruction. We further demonstrate that integrating our method with existing feed-forward frameworks, consistently improves detail preservation, opening new possibilities for high-quality sparse-view 3D reconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We attribute this gap to two factors: 1) existing datasets are inadequate for training and evaluating reasoning-aware video editing, and 2) an inherent disconnect between the models' reasoning and editing capabilities, which prevents the rich understanding from effectively instructing the editing process. Bridging this gap requires an integrated framework that connects reasoning with visual transformation. To address this gap, we introduce the Reason-Informed Video Editing (RVE) task, which requires reasoning about physical plausibility and causal dynamics during editing. To support systematic evaluation, we construct RVE-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark with two complementary subsets: Reasoning-Informed Video Editing and In-Context Video Generation. These subsets cover diverse reasoning dimensions and real-world editing scenarios. Building upon this foundation, we propose the ReViSE, a Self-Reflective Reasoning (SRF) framework that unifies generation and evaluation within a single architecture.

However, these methods degrade sharply under sparse-view settings, where limited observations lead to severe ambiguity between geometry, reflectance, and lighting. We introduce GAINS (Gaussian-based Inverse rendering from Sparse multi-view captures), a two-stage inverse rendering framework that leverages learning-based priors to stabilize geometry and material estimation. GAINS first refines geometry using monocular depth/normal and diffusion priors, then employs segmentation, intrinsic image decomposition (IID), and diffusion priors to regularize material recovery. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that GAINS significantly improves material parameter accuracy, relighting quality, and novel-view synthesis compared to state-of-the-art Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods, especially under sparse-view settings.
