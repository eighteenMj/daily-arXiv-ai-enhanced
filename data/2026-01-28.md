Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized numerous tasks within the computer vision field, including image classification, image segmentation, and object detection. However, the increasing deployment of deep learning models has exposed them to various adversarial attacks, including backdoor attacks. This paper presents a novel dynamic mask-based backdoor attack method, specifically designed for object detection models. We exploit a dataset poisoning technique to embed a malicious trigger, rendering any models trained on this compromised dataset vulnerable to our backdoor attack. We particularly focus on a mushroom detection dataset to demonstrate the practical risks posed by such attacks on critical real-life domains. Our work also emphasizes the importance of creating a detailed backdoor attack scenario to illustrate the significant risks associated with the outsourcing practice. Our approach leverages SAM, a recent and powerful image segmentation AI model, to create masks for dynamic trigger placement, introducing a new and stealthy attack method. Through extensive experimentation, we show that our sophisticated attack scenario maintains high accuracy on clean data with the YOLOv7 object detection model while achieving high attack success rates on poisoned samples. Our approach surpasses traditional methods for backdoor injection, which are based on static and consistent patterns. Our findings underscore the urgent need for robust countermeasures to protect deep learning models from these evolving adversarial threats.

Abstract: Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have demonstrated considerable success in generating high-fidelity 3D models of talking portraits. Despite significant advancements in the rendering speed and generation quality, challenges persist in accurately and efficiently capturing mouth movements in talking portraits. To tackle this challenge, we propose an automatic method based on blink embedding and hash grid landmarks encoding in this study, which can substantially enhance the fidelity of talking faces. Specifically, we leverage facial features encoded as conditional features and integrate audio features as residual terms into our model through a Dynamic Landmark Transformer. Furthermore, we employ neural radiance fields to model the entire face, resulting in a lifelike face representation. Experimental evaluations have validated the superiority of our approach to existing methods.

Abstract: Head avatar reenactment focuses on creating animatable personal avatars from monocular videos, serving as a foundational element for applications like social signal understanding, gaming, human-machine interaction, and computer vision. Recent advances in 3D Morphable Model (3DMM)-based facial reconstruction methods have achieved remarkable high-fidelity face estimation. However, on the one hand, they struggle to capture the entire head, including non-facial regions and background details in real time, which is an essential aspect for producing realistic, high-fidelity head avatars. On the other hand, recent approaches leveraging generative adversarial networks (GANs) for head avatar generation from videos can achieve high-quality reenactments but encounter limitations in reproducing fine-grained head details, such as wrinkles and hair textures. In addition, existing methods generally rely on a large amount of training data, and rarely focus on using only a simple selfie video to achieve avatar reenactment. To address these challenges, this study introduces a method for detailed head avatar reenactment using a selfie video. The approach combines 3DMMs with a StyleGAN-based generator. A detailed reconstruction model is proposed, incorporating mixed loss functions for foreground reconstruction and avatar image generation during adversarial training to recover high-frequency details. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations on self-reenactment and cross-reenactment tasks demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior head avatar reconstruction with rich and intricate textures compared to existing approaches.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As generative models continue to evolve, detecting AI-generated images remains a critical challenge. While effective detection methods exist, they often lack formal interpretability and may rely on implicit assumptions about fake content, potentially limiting robustness to distributional shifts. In this work, we introduce a rigorous, statistically grounded framework for fake image detection that focuses on producing a probability score interpretable with respect to the real-image population. Our method leverages the strengths of multiple existing detectors by combining training-free statistics. We compute p-values over a range of test statistics and aggregate them using classical statistical ensembling to assess alignment with the unified real-image distribution. This framework is generic, flexible, and training-free, making it well-suited for robust fake image detection across diverse and evolving settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估了八种立体方法在密集植被环境中的零样本深度估计性能，发现DEFOM在跨域一致性方面表现最佳，被确立为植被深度估计的基准方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主无人机林业作业需要具有强跨域泛化能力的深度估计方法，但现有评估主要针对城市和室内场景，缺乏对植被密集环境的关注，存在重要的研究空白。

Method: 使用官方发布的预训练权重（在Scene Flow上训练），对8种立体方法（包括迭代精炼、基础模型、扩散基和3D CNN范式）在4个标准基准（ETH3D、KITTI 2012/2015、Middlebury）和新提出的5,313对Canterbury Tree Branches数据集上进行零样本评估。

Result: 结果显示场景依赖的模式：基础模型在结构场景表现优异（BridgeDepth在ETH3D上0.23px；DEFOM在Middlebury上4.65px），而迭代方法在不同基准上表现差异较大（IGEV++在ETH3D上0.36px但在Middlebury上6.77px）。在Tree Branches数据集上，DEFOM表现出最优的跨域一致性（在各基准上平均排名1.75），被确立为植被深度估计的黄金标准基线。

Conclusion: DEFOM在跨域一致性方面表现最佳，被推荐为植被深度估计的基准方法，其预测将作为未来基准测试的伪地面真实数据，填补了林业环境中深度估计评估的重要空白。

Abstract: Autonomous UAV forestry operations require robust depth estimation with strong cross-domain generalization, yet existing evaluations focus on urban and indoor scenarios, leaving a critical gap for vegetation-dense environments. We present the first systematic zero-shot evaluation of eight stereo methods spanning iterative refinement, foundation model, diffusion-based, and 3D CNN paradigms. All methods use officially released pretrained weights (trained on Scene Flow) and are evaluated on four standard benchmarks (ETH3D, KITTI 2012/2015, Middlebury) plus a novel 5,313-pair Canterbury Tree Branches dataset ($1920 \times 1080$). Results reveal scene-dependent patterns: foundation models excel on structured scenes (BridgeDepth: 0.23 px on ETH3D; DEFOM: 4.65 px on Middlebury), while iterative methods show variable cross-benchmark performance (IGEV++: 0.36 px on ETH3D but 6.77 px on Middlebury; IGEV: 0.33 px on ETH3D but 4.99 px on Middlebury). Qualitative evaluation on the Tree Branches dataset establishes DEFOM as the gold-standard baseline for vegetation depth estimation, with superior cross-domain consistency (consistently ranking 1st-2nd across benchmarks, average rank 1.75). DEFOM predictions will serve as pseudo-ground-truth for future benchmarking.

TL;DR: 本文研究了SplitFed学习中通信信道噪声对学习过程和最终模型质量的影响，提出了智能平均策略来提高抗噪声能力，在胚胎图像分割模型上证明该策略能比传统平均方法容忍强两个数量级的噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SplitFed学习虽然降低了客户端计算要求，但特征值、梯度更新和模型更新在通信信道传输易受噪声影响，需要提高学习过程对信道噪声的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出智能平均策略来增强SplitFed学习对信道噪声的抵抗力，通过在通信信道中进行优化处理来减轻噪声影响。

Result: 在胚胎图像分割模型实验中，智能平均策略相比传统平均方法能容忍强两个数量级的信道噪声，同时保持最终模型的准确度。

Conclusion: 智能平均策略有效提高了SplitFed学习的抗噪声能力，为在实际噪声环境中部署分布式学习系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Split-Federated (SplitFed) learning is an extension of federated learning that places minimal requirements on the clients computing infrastructure, since only a small portion of the overall model is deployed on the clients hardware. In SplitFed learning, feature values, gradient updates, and model updates are transferred across communication channels. In this paper, we study the effects of noise in the communication channels on the learning process and the quality of the final model. We propose a smart averaging strategy for SplitFed learning with the goal of improving resilience against channel noise. Experiments on a segmentation model for embryo images shows that the proposed smart averaging strategy is able to tolerate two orders of magnitude stronger noise in the communication channels compared to conventional averaging, while still maintaining the accuracy of the final model.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) has advanced with generative modeling, enabling photorealistic image generation. In few-shot NVS, where only a few input views are available, existing methods often assume equal importance for all input views relative to the target, leading to suboptimal results.
  We address this limitation by introducing a camera-weighting mechanism that adjusts the importance of source views based on their relevance to the target. We propose two approaches: a deterministic weighting scheme leveraging geometric properties like Euclidean distance and angular differences, and a cross-attention-based learning scheme that optimizes view weighting. Additionally, models can be further trained with our camera-weighting scheme to refine their understanding of view relevance and enhance synthesis quality. This mechanism is adaptable and can be integrated into various NVS algorithms, improving their ability to synthesize high-quality novel views. Our results demonstrate that adaptive view weighting enhances accuracy and realism, offering a promising direction for improving NVS.

Abstract: Chronic wound monitoring and management require accurate and efficient wound measurement methods. This paper presents a fast, non-invasive 3D wound measurement algorithm based on RGB-D imaging. The method combines RGB-D odometry with B-spline surface reconstruction to generate detailed 3D wound meshes, enabling automatic computation of clinically relevant wound measurements such as perimeter, surface area, and dimensions. We evaluated our system on realistic silicone wound phantoms and measured sub-millimetre 3D reconstruction accuracy compared with high-resolution ground-truth scans. The extracted measurements demonstrated low variability across repeated captures and strong agreement with manual assessments. The proposed pipeline also outperformed a state-of-the-art object-centric RGB-D reconstruction method while maintaining runtimes suitable for real-time clinical deployment. Our approach offers a promising tool for automated wound assessment in both clinical and remote healthcare settings.

TL;DR: 提出神经皮质地图作为连续紧凑的神经表示，替代传统离散结构，用于皮质特征地图表示，学习效率高且支持任意分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统皮质特征地图使用离散网格或网格结构，存在计算效率限制和分辨率固定的问题，需要一种连续、紧凑且高效的表示方法。

Method: 建立神经皮质地图作为连续神经表示，可从任意大小的网格学习特征并提供任意分辨率输出。提出NC-Reg迭代算法，结合神经皮质特征地图、梯度下降优化和模拟退火策略进行皮质表面刚体配准。

Result: 神经皮质地图在球面上的优化效率比传统重心插值快30倍（相同迭代次数）。NC-Reg算法实现亚度精度（距离全局最优<1°），作为稳健的预对齐策略在临床环境中表现优异。

Conclusion: 神经皮质地图为皮质特征表示提供了高效的连续替代方案，NC-Reg算法证明了其在皮质表面刚体配准中的有效性和临床实用性，可作为可靠的预处理方法。

Abstract: We introduce neural cortical maps, a continuous and compact neural representation for cortical feature maps, as an alternative to traditional discrete structures such as grids and meshes. It can learn from meshes of arbitrary size and provide learnt features at any resolution. Neural cortical maps enable efficient optimization on the sphere and achieve runtimes up to 30 times faster than classic barycentric interpolation (for the same number of iterations). As a proof of concept, we investigate rigid registration of cortical surfaces and propose NC-Reg, a novel iterative algorithm that involves the use of neural cortical feature maps, gradient descent optimization and a simulated annealing strategy. Through ablation studies and subject-to-template experiments, our method demonstrates sub-degree accuracy ($<1^\circ$ from the global optimum), and serves as a promising robust pre-alignment strategy, which is critical in clinical settings.

TL;DR: NuiWorld提出了一种解决世界生成中可控性、可扩展性和效率挑战的框架，通过生成式引导策略、可变场景块表示和向量集压缩来提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有世界生成方法面临三个主要障碍：可控性有限、可扩展性不足和推理效率低下。端到端场景生成模型受限于数据稀缺，而对象中心方法依赖固定分辨率表示，导致大场景保真度下降。

Method: 1. 提出生成式引导策略，从少量输入图像开始，利用3D重建和可扩展场景生成技术合成不同规模和布局的场景数据；2. 使用伪草图标签实现可控性；3. 将场景表示为可变场景块集合，将其压缩为扁平化的向量集表示以降低大场景的token长度。

Result: 该框架克服了数据稀缺问题，能够生成不同规模的场景训练数据，保持跨场景尺寸一致的几何保真度，同时提升训练和推理效率。伪草图标签还显示出对未见草图的泛化能力。

Conclusion: NuiWorld通过创新的数据生成策略和高效的场景表示方法，为解决世界生成中的关键挑战提供了可行方案，在可控性、可扩展性和效率方面取得显著改进。

Abstract: World generation is a fundamental capability for applications like video games, simulation, and robotics. However, existing approaches face three main obstacles: controllability, scalability, and efficiency. End-to-end scene generation models have been limited by data scarcity. While object-centric generation approaches rely on fixed resolution representations, degrading fidelity for larger scenes. Training-free approaches, while flexible, are often slow and computationally expensive at inference time. We present NuiWorld, a framework that attempts to address these challenges. To overcome data scarcity, we propose a generative bootstrapping strategy that starts from a few input images. Leveraging recent 3D reconstruction and expandable scene generation techniques, we synthesize scenes of varying sizes and layouts, producing enough data to train an end-to-end model. Furthermore, our framework enables controllability through pseudo sketch labels, and demonstrates a degree of generalization to previously unseen sketches. Our approach represents scenes as a collection of variable scene chunks, which are compressed into a flattened vector-set representation. This significantly reduces the token length for large scenes, enabling consistent geometric fidelity across scenes sizes while improving training and inference efficiency.

TL;DR: PixSearch是一种统一的端到端分割大型多模态模型，通过<search>令牌触发检索、选择查询模态并生成像素级掩码作为视觉查询，显著提升VQA任务的事实一致性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态检索增强生成系统缺乏内部策略来决定何时以及如何进行检索，这限制了VQA任务中细粒度感知与外部知识结合的效果。

Method: PixSearch通过<search>令牌触发检索，支持文本、图像或区域级查询模态选择，能够生成像素级掩码直接作为视觉查询。采用两阶段监督微调策略，保持分割能力的同时学习检索时机和查询选择。

Result: 在CRAG-MM基准测试中比整图检索相对提升19.7%的准确率，在自我中心化和实体中心化VQA任务上显著改善事实一致性和泛化能力，同时在多种VQA和纯文本QA任务上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: PixSearch首次将区域级感知与检索增强推理统一为端到端模型，避免了传统模块化管道的依赖，为多模态检索增强提供了更高效统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) often requires coupling fine-grained perception with factual knowledge beyond the input image. Prior multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MM-RAG) systems improve factual grounding but lack an internal policy for when and how to retrieve. We propose PixSearch, the first end-to-end Segmenting Large Multimodal Model (LMM) that unifies region-level perception and retrieval-augmented reasoning. During encoding, PixSearch emits <search> tokens to trigger retrieval, selects query modalities (text, image, or region), and generates pixel-level masks that directly serve as visual queries, eliminating the reliance on modular pipelines (detectors, segmenters, captioners, etc.). A two-stage supervised fine-tuning regimen with search-interleaved supervision teaches retrieval timing and query selection while preserving segmentation ability. On egocentric and entity-centric VQA benchmarks, PixSearch substantially improves factual consistency and generalization, yielding a 19.7% relative gain in accuracy on CRAG-MM compared to whole image retrieval, while retaining competitive reasoning performance on various VQA and text-only QA tasks.

Abstract: Vision--language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on many multimodal benchmarks but remain brittle on spatial reasoning tasks that require aligning abstract overhead representations with egocentric views. We introduce m2sv, a scalable benchmark for map-to-street-view spatial reasoning that asks models to infer camera viewing direction by aligning a north-up overhead map with a Street View image captured at the same real-world intersection. We release m2sv-20k, a geographically diverse benchmark with controlled ambiguity, along with m2sv-sft-11k, a curated set of structured reasoning traces for supervised fine-tuning.
  Despite strong performance on existing multimodal benchmarks, the best evaluated VLM achieves only 65.2% accuracy on m2sv, far below the human baseline of 95%. While supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning yield consistent gains, cross-benchmark evaluations reveal limited transfer. Beyond aggregate accuracy, we systematically analyze difficulty in map-to-street-view reasoning using both structural signals and human effort, and conduct an extensive failure analysis of adapted open models. Our findings highlight persistent gaps in geometric alignment, evidence aggregation, and reasoning consistency, motivating future work on grounded spatial reasoning across viewpoints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现有AI方法在大规模CT扫描中泛癌筛查的局限性——难以定位各类微小病灶、前景背景极度失衡导致模型难以聚焦病变区域、冗余关注健康区域降低效率并增加假阳性

Method: 提出GF-Screen框架：Glance模型粗略定位可能病变区域并选择子体积；Focus模型精确定位分割病灶；通过强化学习用分割结果奖励Glance模型；引入group relative learning范式优化选择过程

Result: 在16个内部和7个外部数据集（9种病灶类型）上的实验验证了有效性；在MICCAI FLARE25挑战赛公开验证leaderboard上表现最佳，相比FLARE24冠军方案大幅提升（+25.6% DSC, +28.2% NSD）

Conclusion: GF-Screen首次成功将先进强化学习技术应用于泛癌筛查特定挑战，通过模拟放射科医生的‘一瞥与专注’诊断策略，有效提高了微小病灶检测的准确性和效率

Abstract: Pan-cancer screening in large-scale CT scans remains challenging for existing AI methods, primarily due to the difficulty of localizing diverse types of tiny lesions in large CT volumes. The extreme foreground-background imbalance significantly hinders models from focusing on diseased regions, while redundant focus on healthy regions not only decreases the efficiency but also increases false positives. Inspired by radiologists' glance and focus diagnostic strategy, we introduce GF-Screen, a Glance and Focus reinforcement learning framework for pan-cancer screening. GF-Screen employs a Glance model to localize the diseased regions and a Focus model to precisely segment the lesions, where segmentation results of the Focus model are leveraged to reward the Glance model via Reinforcement Learning (RL). Specifically, the Glance model crops a group of sub-volumes from the entire CT volume and learns to select the sub-volumes with lesions for the Focus model to segment. Given that the selecting operation is non-differentiable for segmentation training, we propose to employ the segmentation results to reward the Glance model. To optimize the Glance model, we introduce a novel group relative learning paradigm, which employs group relative comparison to prioritize high-advantage predictions and discard low-advantage predictions within sub-volume groups, not only improving efficiency but also reducing false positives. In this way, for the first time, we effectively extend cutting-edge RL techniques to tackle the specific challenges in pan-cancer screening. Extensive experiments on 16 internal and 7 external datasets across 9 lesion types demonstrated the effectiveness of GF-Screen. Notably, GF-Screen leads the public validation leaderboard of MICCAI FLARE25 pan-cancer challenge, surpassing the FLARE24 champion solution by a large margin (+25.6% DSC and +28.2% NSD).

TL;DR: Reg-TTR框架通过测试时精炼结合深度学习和传统配准方法，提升基础模型的配准精度，只需21%额外推理时间即达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像配准方法鲁棒但迭代过程慢；深度学习推理快但易受域偏移影响；现有配准基础模型虽兼顾速度与鲁棒性，但难以匹敌专用数据训练模型的峰值精度。因此需要一种方法结合两者的互补优势。

Method: 提出Reg-TTR测试时精炼框架，在推理阶段对预训练模型的预测结果进行精炼，将深度学习与传统配准技术结合，仅需少量额外计算成本。

Result: 在两个不同任务上评估显示，Reg-TTR达到最先进性能，推理时间仅增加21%（0.56秒），保持接近先前深度学习方法的推理速度。

Conclusion: 随着基础模型发展，该框架提供了缩小配准基础模型与专用数据训练SOTA方法间性能差距的有效策略，可在仅少量额外成本下显著提升精度。

Abstract: Traditional image registration methods are robust but slow due to their iterative nature. While deep learning has accelerated inference, it often struggles with domain shifts. Emerging registration foundation models offer a balance of speed and robustness, yet typically cannot match the peak accuracy of specialized models trained on specific datasets. To mitigate this limitation, we propose Reg-TTR, a test-time refinement framework that synergizes the complementary strengths of both deep learning and conventional registration techniques. By refining the predictions of pre-trained models at inference, our method delivers significantly improved registration accuracy at a modest computational cost, requiring only 21% additional inference time (0.56s). We evaluate Reg-TTR on two distinct tasks and show that it achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while maintaining inference speeds close to previous deep learning methods. As foundation models continue to emerge, our framework offers an efficient strategy to narrow the performance gap between registration foundation models and SOTA methods trained on specialized datasets. The source code will be publicly available following the acceptance of this work.

Conclusion: 通过频域视角的频带替换方法，可以有效将文本到图像扩散模型适配为文本驱动的图像到图像转换模型，在保持高质量的同时实现高效、灵活和可控的图像转换与编辑。

Abstract: With large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models achieving significant advancements in open-domain image creation, increasing attention has been focused on their natural extension to the realm of text-driven image-to-image (I2I) translation, where a source image acts as visual guidance to the generated image in addition to the textual guidance provided by the text prompt. We propose FBSDiff, a novel framework adapting off-the-shelf T2I diffusion model into the I2I paradigm from a fresh frequency-domain perspective. Through dynamic frequency band substitution of diffusion features, FBSDiff realizes versatile and highly controllable text-driven I2I in a plug-and-play manner (without need for model training, fine-tuning, or online optimization), allowing appearance-guided, layout-guided, and contour-guided I2I translation by progressively substituting low-frequency band, mid-frequency band, and high-frequency band of latent diffusion features, respectively. In addition, FBSDiff flexibly enables continuous control over I2I correlation intensity simply by tuning the bandwidth of the substituted frequency band. To further promote image translation efficiency, flexibility, and functionality, we propose FBSDiff++ which improves upon FBSDiff mainly in three aspects: (1) accelerate inference speed by a large margin (8.9$\times$ speedup in inference) with refined model architecture; (2) improve the Frequency Band Substitution module to allow for input source images of arbitrary resolution and aspect ratio; (3) extend model functionality to enable localized image manipulation and style-specific content creation with only subtle adjustments to the core method. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments verify superiority of FBSDiff++ in I2I translation visual quality, efficiency, versatility, and controllability compared to related advanced approaches.

TL;DR: 针对开放世界目标检测中的领域不变表征学习问题，提出基于粒度球理论的改进领域对抗学习方法GB-DAL，通过原型粒度球划分和模拟非因果因子模块解决领域标签稀疏和隐式非因果因子识别难点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于领域对抗学习的领域泛化方法主要关注学习领域不变信息，但往往忽略了潜在的隐式非因果因子。研究发现两个关键原因：1）基于领域判别器的方法受限于极稀疏的领域标签（每个数据集仅一个领域标签），只能关联显式非因果因子；2）由未知数据偏差引起的非因果因子过于隐式，无法被传统领域对抗学习范式单独识别。

Method: 提出GB-DAL方法：1）PGBS模块：基于原型粒度球划分技术，从有限数据集中生成更密集的领域，形成更细粒度的粒度球，以揭示更多潜在非因果因子；2）SNF模块：受对抗扰动启发，将其视为非因果因子进行数据增强，降低非因果因子的隐式性，并促进GB-DAL训练。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的对比实验表明，该方法在新型场景中取得了更好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 通过引入粒度球视角，提出改进的领域对抗学习方法GB-DAL，有效解决了领域标签稀疏和隐式非因果因子识别问题，在开放世界目标检测任务中展现出优越的领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Open world object detection faces a significant challenge in domain-invariant representation, i.e., implicit non-causal factors. Most domain generalization (DG) methods based on domain adversarial learning (DAL) pay much attention to learn domain-invariant information, but often overlook the potential non-causal factors. We unveil two critical causes: 1) The domain discriminator-based DAL method is subject to the extremely sparse domain label, i.e., assigning only one domain label to each dataset, thus can only associate explicit non-causal factor, which is incredibly limited. 2) The non-causal factors, induced by unidentified data bias, are excessively implicit and cannot be solely discerned by conventional DAL paradigm. Based on these key findings, inspired by the Granular-Ball perspective, we propose an improved DAL method, i.e., GB-DAL. The proposed GB-DAL utilizes Prototype-based Granular Ball Splitting (PGBS) module to generate more dense domains from limited datasets, akin to more fine-grained granular balls, indicating more potential non-causal factors. Inspired by adversarial perturbations akin to non-causal factors, we propose a Simulated Non-causal Factors (SNF) module as a means of data augmentation to reduce the implicitness of non-causal factors, and facilitate the training of GB-DAL. Comparative experiments on numerous benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves better generalization performance in novel circumstances.

Abstract: Industrial point cloud segmentation for Digital Twin construction faces a persistent challenge: safety-critical components such as reducers and valves are systematically misclassified. These failures stem from two compounding factors: such components are rare in training data, yet they share identical local geometry with dominant structures like pipes. This work identifies a dual crisis unique to industrial 3D data extreme class imbalance 215:1 ratio compounded by geometric ambiguity where most tail classes share cylindrical primitives with head classes. Existing frequency-based re-weighting methods address statistical imbalance but cannot resolve geometric ambiguity. We propose spatial context constraints that leverage neighborhood prediction consistency to disambiguate locally similar structures. Our approach extends the Class-Balanced (CB) Loss framework with two architecture-agnostic mechanisms: (1) Boundary-CB, an entropy-based constraint that emphasizes ambiguous boundaries, and (2) Density-CB, a density-based constraint that compensates for scan-dependent variations. Both integrate as plug-and-play modules without network modifications, requiring only loss function replacement. On the Industrial3D dataset (610M points from water treatment facilities), our method achieves 55.74% mIoU with 21.7% relative improvement on tail-class performance (29.59% vs. 24.32% baseline) while preserving head-class accuracy (88.14%). Components with primitive-sharing ambiguity show dramatic gains: reducer improves from 0% to 21.12% IoU; valve improves by 24.3% relative. This resolves geometric ambiguity without the typical head-tail trade-off, enabling reliable identification of safety-critical components for automated knowledge extraction in Digital Twin applications.

TL;DR: 提出無監督語義感知曝光校正網絡(SECNet)，解決缺少真實標註圖像和忽略語義信息導致的色彩偏移問題，在真實世界曝光圖像校正上優於現有無監督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 現有曝光校正方法面臨兩個關鍵挑戰：(1)忽略物體層級的區域語義信息導致色彩偏移偽影；(2)現實世界曝光圖像通常沒有真實標籤，標註需要大量人工編輯工作。

Method: SECNet包含自適應語義感知融合模塊，將預訓練Fast Segment Anything Model提取的語義信息融合到共享圖像特徵空間。使用多尺度殘差空間Mamba組恢復細節和調整曝光。提出基於CLIP指導的偽真實標籤生成器，通過微調自動識別曝光情況並指導定制校正。開發語義提示一致性損失，利用FastSAM和CLIP的先驗知識進行無監督訓練。

Result: 綜合實驗結果表明該方法在真實世界曝光圖像校正方面表現有效，在數值和視覺效果上都優於最先進的無監督方法。

Conclusion: 提出的無監督語義感知曝光校正網絡通過有效融合語義信息、使用偽真實標籤生成器和一致性損失，成功解決了曝光校正中的色彩偏移和無標註數據挑戰。

Abstract: Improper exposure often leads to severe loss of details, color distortion, and reduced contrast. Exposure correction still faces two critical challenges: (1) the ignorance of object-wise regional semantic information causes the color shift artifacts; (2) real-world exposure images generally have no ground-truth labels, and its labeling entails massive manual editing. To tackle the challenges, we propose a new unsupervised semantic-aware exposure correction network. It contains an adaptive semantic-aware fusion module, which effectively fuses the semantic information extracted from a pre-trained Fast Segment Anything Model into a shared image feature space. Then the fused features are used by our multi-scale residual spatial mamba group to restore the details and adjust the exposure. To avoid manual editing, we propose a pseudo-ground truth generator guided by CLIP, which is fine-tuned to automatically identify exposure situations and instruct the tailored corrections. Also, we leverage the rich priors from the FastSAM and CLIP to develop a semantic-prompt consistency loss to enforce semantic consistency and image-prompt alignment for unsupervised training. Comprehensive experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our method in correcting real-world exposure images and outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods both numerically and visually.

Abstract: Unlike conventional person re-identification (ReID), clothes-changing ReID (CC-ReID) presents severe challenges due to substantial appearance variations introduced by clothing changes. In this work, we propose the Quality-Aware Dual-Branch Matching (QA-ReID), which jointly leverages RGB-based features and parsing-based representations to model both global appearance and clothing-invariant structural cues. These heterogeneous features are adaptively fused through a multi-modal attention module. At the matching stage, we further design the Quality-Aware Query Adaptive Convolution (QAConv-QA), which incorporates pixel-level importance weighting and bidirectional consistency constraints to enhance robustness against clothing variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QA-ReID achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, including PRCC, LTCC, and VC-Clothes, and significantly outperforms existing approaches under cross-clothing scenarios.

Abstract: Precise segmentation of retinal arteries and veins carries the diagnosis of systemic cardiovascular conditions. However, standard convolutional architectures often yield topologically disjointed segmentations, characterized by gaps and discontinuities that render reliable graph-based clinical analysis impossible despite high pixel-level accuracy. To address this, we introduce a topology-aware framework engineered to maintain vascular connectivity. Our architecture fuses a Topological Feature Fusion Module (TFFM) that maps local feature representations into a latent graph space, deploying Graph Attention Networks to capture global structural dependencies often missed by fixed receptive fields. Furthermore, we drive the learning process with a hybrid objective function, coupling Tversky loss for class imbalance with soft clDice loss to explicitly penalize topological disconnects. Evaluation on the Fundus-AVSeg dataset reveals state-of-the-art performance, achieving a combined Dice score of 90.97% and a 95% Hausdorff Distance of 3.50 pixels. Notably, our method decreases vessel fragmentation by approximately 38% relative to baselines, yielding topologically coherent vascular trees viable for automated biomarker quantification. We open-source our code at https://tffm-module.github.io/.

Abstract: Low-light image super-resolution (LLSR) is a challenging task due to the coupled degradation of low resolution and poor illumination. To address this, we propose the Guided Texture and Feature Modulation Network (GTFMN), a novel framework that decouples the LLSR task into two sub-problems: illumination estimation and texture restoration. First, our network employs a dedicated Illumination Stream whose purpose is to predict a spatially varying illumination map that accurately captures lighting distribution. Further, this map is utilized as an explicit guide within our novel Illumination Guided Modulation Block (IGM Block) to dynamically modulate features in the Texture Stream. This mechanism achieves spatially adaptive restoration, enabling the network to intensify enhancement in poorly lit regions while preserving details in well-exposed areas. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTFMN achieves the best performance among competing methods on the OmniNormal5 and OmniNormal15 datasets, outperforming them in both quantitative metrics and visual quality.

*Lifan Jiang,Boxi Wu,Yuhang Pei,Tianrun Wu,Yongyuan Chen,Yan Zhao,Shiyu Yu,Deng Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SNR-Edit提出一种免训练的图像编辑框架，通过自适应噪声控制实现准确潜在轨迹校正，避免传统基于反演的流程存在的轨迹漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于流生成的免反演图像编辑方法通常依赖固定高斯噪声构建源轨迹，导致轨迹动态偏置，引起结构退化或质量损失。为此，需要一种能校正轨迹漂移且保持高保真度的方法。

Method: SNR-Edit采用结构感知的噪声校正机制，将分割约束注入初始噪声，使源轨迹的随机分量锚定到真实图像的隐式反演位置，从而减少源-目标传输过程中的轨迹漂移。该方法无需模型调优或反演，是轻量级修改。

Result: 在SD3和FLUX模型上，基于PIE-Bench和SNR-Bench的评估显示，SNR-Edit在像素级指标和基于VLM的评分上均表现优异，且每幅图像仅增加约1秒开销。

Conclusion: SNR-Edit作为一种免训练的框架，通过自适应噪声控制实现了高保真度的结构保持，有效解决了基于流生成的图像编辑中的轨迹偏置问题，具有高效性和实用性。

Abstract: Inversion-free image editing using flow-based generative models challenges the prevailing inversion-based pipelines. However, existing approaches rely on fixed Gaussian noise to construct the source trajectory, leading to biased trajectory dynamics and causing structural degradation or quality loss. To address this, we introduce SNR-Edit, a training-free framework achieving faithful Latent Trajectory Correction via adaptive noise control. Mechanistically, SNR-Edit uses structure-aware noise rectification to inject segmentation constraints into the initial noise, anchoring the stochastic component of the source trajectory to the real image's implicit inversion position and reducing trajectory drift during source--target transport. This lightweight modification yields smoother latent trajectories and ensures high-fidelity structural preservation without requiring model tuning or inversion. Across SD3 and FLUX, evaluations on PIE-Bench and SNR-Bench show that SNR-Edit delivers performance on pixel-level metrics and VLM-based scoring, while adding only about 1s overhead per image.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为对比频谱矫正（CSR）的高效测试时防御方法，以解决视觉语言模型对对抗样本的脆弱性。CSR通过优化修正扰动，在频谱引导的对比目标下将输入与自然流形重新对齐，在16个分类基准测试中优于现有方法18.1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP等视觉语言模型在零样本泛化方面表现出色，但对对抗样本高度脆弱。现有的测试时防御方法在面对强攻击时鲁棒性不足，且存在推理延迟高、任务适用性有限的问题。

Method: 通过研究对抗样本的内在特性，发现其在渐进频率衰减下表现出严重的特征不一致性。基于此，提出CSR方法，它优化一个修正扰动，在频谱引导的对比目标下自适应地将输入重新对齐到自然流形。

Result: 在16个分类基准测试中，CSR对抗AutoAttack强攻击的平均性能优于最优方法18.1%，且推理开销适中。此外，该方法在多种视觉任务中表现出广泛的适用性。

Conclusion: CSR是一种高效且通用的测试时防御方法，通过利用模型固有的频谱偏置和对比学习机制，显著提升了视觉语言模型对对抗样本的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot generalization, yet remain highly vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs). While test-time defenses are promising, existing methods fail to provide sufficient robustness against strong attacks and are often hampered by high inference latency and task-specific applicability. To address these limitations, we start by investigating the intrinsic properties of AEs, which reveals that AEs exhibit severe feature inconsistency under progressive frequency attenuation. We further attribute this to the model's inherent spectral bias. Leveraging this insight, we propose an efficient test-time defense named Contrastive Spectral Rectification (CSR). CSR optimizes a rectification perturbation to realign the input with the natural manifold under a spectral-guided contrastive objective, which is applied input-adaptively. Extensive experiments across 16 classification benchmarks demonstrate that CSR outperforms the SOTA by an average of 18.1% against strong AutoAttack with modest inference overhead. Furthermore, CSR exhibits broad applicability across diverse visual tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Summu77/CSR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态大语言模型在工业质检特别是PCB检测等复杂场景中表现不足，主要原因是缺乏高质量、统一的视觉-语言评估基准。PCB检测面临组件密集、线路复杂、缺陷细微等独特挑战，需要领域专业知识和标准化评估体系。

Method: 构建UniPCB统一视觉-语言基准，通过系统性流水线从不同来源整理和标准化三种标注场景的数据；引入PCB-GPT多模态模型，基于新生成的指令数据集训练，采用模拟人类专家学习过程的渐进式课程学习策略。

Result: 在UniPCB基准上的评估显示，现有MLLMs在领域特定任务上存在不足，而PCB-GPT建立了新的性能基线。特别是在细粒度缺陷定位方面，性能比最强的竞争对手提升超过一倍，在定位和分析方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: UniPCB基准和PCB-GPT模型为PCB质量检测领域提供了首个统一的评估框架和有效的解决方案，显著提升了多模态大模型在复杂工业检测任务中的能力，相关数据和模型将开源以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show promise for general industrial quality inspection, but fall short in complex scenarios, such as Printed Circuit Board (PCB) inspection. PCB inspection poses unique challenges due to densely packed components, complex wiring structures, and subtle defect patterns that require specialized domain expertise. However, a high-quality, unified vision-language benchmark for quantitatively evaluating MLLMs across PCB inspection tasks remains absent, stemming not only from limited data availability but also from fragmented datasets and inconsistent standardization. To fill this gap, we propose UniPCB, the first unified vision-language benchmark for open-ended PCB quality inspection. UniPCB is built via a systematic pipeline that curates and standardizes data from disparate sources across three annotated scenarios. Furthermore, we introduce PCB-GPT, an MLLM trained on a new instruction dataset generated by this pipeline, utilizing a novel progressive curriculum that mimics the learning process of human experts. Evaluations on the UniPCB benchmark show that while existing MLLMs falter on domain-specific tasks, PCB-GPT establishes a new baseline. Notably, it more than doubles the performance on fine-grained defect localization compared to the strongest competitors, with significant advantages in localization and analysis. We will release the instruction data, benchmark, and model to facilitate future research.

TL;DR: SimpleSeg：一种简单的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）原生像素级感知方法，通过将分割重构为序列生成问题，直接预测描述物体边界的坐标点序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖复杂的任务特定设计来赋予MLLMs像素级感知能力，本文探索MLLMs本身是否具有强大的底层感知潜力，无需专门架构即可实现精确的空间理解。

Method: 1) 将分割任务重构为简单的序列生成问题：模型在语言空间中直接预测描述物体边界的坐标点序列；2) 引入两阶段训练流程SF→RL：首先使用监督学习，然后通过基于IoU奖励的强化学习精化点序列以匹配真实轮廓。

Result: 在分割基准测试中，SimpleSeg实现了与依赖复杂任务特定设计方法相当、甚至更优的性能，证明了标准MLLM架构具有强大的固有底层感知能力。

Conclusion: 精确的空间理解可以通过简单的点预测实现，挑战了对辅助组件的普遍需求，为更统一、更强大的视觉语言模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: We present SimpleSeg, a strikingly simple yet highly effective approach to endow Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with native pixel-level perception. Our method reframes segmentation as a simple sequence generation problem: the model directly predicts sequences of points (textual coordinates) delineating object boundaries, entirely within its language space. To achieve high fidelity, we introduce a two-stage SF$\to$RL training pipeline, where Reinforcement Learning with an IoU-based reward refines the point sequences to accurately match ground-truth contours. We find that the standard MLLM architecture possesses a strong, inherent capacity for low-level perception that can be unlocked without any specialized architecture. On segmentation benchmarks, SimpleSeg achieves performance that is comparable to, and often surpasses, methods relying on complex, task-specific designs. This work lays out that precise spatial understanding can emerge from simple point prediction, challenging the prevailing need for auxiliary components and paving the way for more unified and capable VLMs. Homepage: https://simpleseg.github.io/

Abstract: While current video generation focuses on text or image conditions, practical applications like video editing and vlogging often need to seamlessly connect separate clips. In our work, we introduce Video Connecting, an innovative task that aims to generate smooth intermediate video content between given start and end clips. However, the absence of standardized evaluation benchmarks has hindered the development of this task. To bridge this gap, we proposed VC-Bench, a novel benchmark specifically designed for video connecting. It includes 1,579 high-quality videos collected from public platforms, covering 15 main categories and 72 subcategories to ensure diversity and structure. VC-Bench focuses on three core aspects: Video Quality Score VQS, Start-End Consistency Score SECS, and Transition Smoothness Score TSS. Together, they form a comprehensive framework that moves beyond conventional quality-only metrics. We evaluated multiple state-of-the-art video generation models on VC-Bench. Experimental results reveal significant limitations in maintaining start-end consistency and transition smoothness, leading to lower overall coherence and fluidity. We expect that VC-Bench will serve as a pioneering benchmark to inspire and guide future research in video connecting.

TL;DR: 本文提出了TIGaussian框架，专门用于增强文本-图像-3D之间的跨模态对齐能力，利用了3D高斯泼溅技术的特点来实现更优的3D模态特征提取和跨模态对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型主要连接文本和图像特征，而3D模态数据（如点云、3D高斯）的引入为3D相关任务（如跨模态检索、零样本分类、场景识别）提供了预训练可能。然而，在提取3D模态特征和弥合不同模态之间的差距方面仍存在挑战，需要一种能够有效对齐文本、图像和3D数据的框架。

Method: 提出了TIGaussian框架，采用多分支3DGS标记器将3D高斯泼溅结构的内在特性解耦为紧凑的潜在表示，实现更通用的特征提取。开发了双向跨模态对齐策略：1）多视角特征融合机制，利用扩散先验解决图像-3D对齐中的视角模糊问题；2）文本-3D投影模块，将3D特征自适应映射到文本嵌入空间以实现更好的文本-3D对齐。

Result: 在多个数据集上的大量实验表明，TIGaussian在多种任务中达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: TIGaussian框架通过创新的3D高斯泼溅标记器和跨模态对齐策略，有效地解决了3D模态特征提取和跨模态对齐的挑战，为文本、图像和3D数据的联合理解提供了强大的解决方案。

Abstract: While visual-language models have profoundly linked features between texts and images, the incorporation of 3D modality data, such as point clouds and 3D Gaussians, further enables pretraining for 3D-related tasks, e.g., cross-modal retrieval, zero-shot classification, and scene recognition. As challenges remain in extracting 3D modal features and bridging the gap between different modalities, we propose TIGaussian, a framework that harnesses 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) characteristics to strengthen cross-modality alignment through multi-branch 3DGS tokenizer and modality-specific 3D feature alignment strategies. Specifically, our multi-branch 3DGS tokenizer decouples the intrinsic properties of 3DGS structures into compact latent representations, enabling more generalizable feature extraction. To further bridge the modality gap, we develop a bidirectional cross-modal alignment strategies: a multi-view feature fusion mechanism that leverages diffusion priors to resolve perspective ambiguity in image-3D alignment, while a text-3D projection module adaptively maps 3D features to text embedding space for better text-3D alignment. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of TIGaussian in multiple tasks.

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models has enabled the creation of highly realistic synthetic images, raising concerns about authenticity and trust in digital media. Detecting such fake content reliably is an urgent challenge. While deep learning approaches dominate current literature, handcrafted features remain attractive for their interpretability, efficiency, and generalizability. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of handcrafted descriptors, including raw pixels, color histograms, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), Local Binary Patterns (LBP), Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), and wavelet features, on the CIFAKE dataset of real versus synthetic images. Using 50,000 training and 10,000 test samples, we benchmark seven classifiers ranging from Logistic Regression to advanced gradient-boosted ensembles (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost). Results demonstrate that LightGBM consistently outperforms alternatives, achieving PR-AUC 0.9879, ROC-AUC 0.9878, F1 0.9447, and a Brier score of 0.0414 with mixed features, representing strong gains in calibration and discrimination over simpler descriptors. Across three configurations (baseline, advanced, mixed), performance improves monotonically, confirming that combining diverse handcrafted features yields substantial benefit. These findings highlight the continued relevance of carefully engineered features and ensemble learning for detecting synthetic images, particularly in contexts where interpretability and computational efficiency are critical.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了半监督域适应中的类别预测偏差问题，通过结合无监督域适应和半监督学习技术，为工业应用提供了增强模型适应性、降低标注成本、提升性能的重要贡献。

Abstract: Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation (SSDA) leverages knowledge from a fully labeled source domain to classify data in a partially labeled target domain. Due to the limited number of labeled samples in the target domain, there can be intrinsic similarity of classes in the feature space, which may result in biased predictions, even when the model is trained on a balanced dataset. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a multi-view consistency framework, which includes two views for training strongly augmented data. One is a debiasing strategy for correcting class-wise prediction probabilities according to the prediction performance of the model. The other involves leveraging pseudo-negative labels derived from the model predictions. Furthermore, we introduce a cross-domain affinity learning aimed at aligning features of the same class across different domains, thereby enhancing overall performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the competing methods on two standard domain adaptation datasets, DomainNet and Office-Home. Combining unsupervised domain adaptation and semi-supervised learning offers indispensable contributions to the industrial sector by enhancing model adaptability, reducing annotation costs, and improving performance.

Abstract: Pro-Mist filters are widely used in cinematography for their ability to create soft halation, lower contrast, and produce a distinctive, atmospheric style. These effects are difficult to reproduce digitally due to the complex behavior of light diffusion. We present ProMist-5K, a dataset designed to support cinematic style emulation. It is built using a physically inspired pipeline in a scene-referred linear space and includes 20,000 high-resolution image pairs across four configurations, covering two filter densities (1/2 and 1/8) and two focal lengths (20mm and 50mm). Unlike general style datasets, ProMist-5K focuses on realistic glow and highlight diffusion effects. Multiple blur layers and carefully tuned weighting are used to model the varying intensity and spread of optical diffusion. The dataset provides a consistent and controllable target domain that supports various image translation models and learning paradigms. Experiments show that the dataset works well across different training settings and helps capture both subtle and strong cinematic appearances. ProMist-5K offers a practical and physically grounded resource for film-inspired image transformation, bridging the gap between digital flexibility and traditional lens aesthetics.

Abstract: Facial shadows often degrade image quality and the performance of vision algorithms. Existing methods struggle to remove shadows while preserving texture, especially under complex lighting conditions, and they lack real-world paired datasets for training. We present the Augmented Shadow Face in the Wild (ASFW) dataset, the first large-scale real-world dataset for facial shadow removal, containing 1,081 paired shadow and shadow-free images created via a professional Photoshop workflow. ASFW offers photorealistic shadow variations and accurate ground truths, bridging the gap between synthetic and real domains. Deep models trained on ASFW demonstrate improved shadow removal in real-world conditions. We also introduce the Face Shadow Eraser (FSE) method to showcase the effectiveness of the dataset. Experiments demonstrate that ASFW enhances the performance of facial shadow removal models, setting new standards for this task.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出InstaRadar和RCDPT集成框架，通过实例分割引导的雷达增强和预训练深度模块改进单目3D目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目摄像头在3D检测中存在深度歧义和恶劣条件下的鲁棒性问题，雷达虽具有互补优势但稀疏性限制了其直接应用，因此需要有效的雷达-摄像头融合方案。

Method: 1) InstaRadar：利用预训练分割掩码指导雷达点扩展，增强雷达密度和语义对齐；2) 将预训练的RCDPT深度模块集成到BEVDepth框架中替代原有深度模块。

Result: InstaRadar在雷达引导深度估计中达到SOTA，集成RCDPT后明显提升BEVDepth的3D检测性能，但落后于直接提取BEV特征的雷达-摄像头融合模型。

Conclusion: InstaRadar能有效生成高质量深度特征，显式深度监督对3D检测有益；未来将扩展为点云状表示并集成带时序线索的专用雷达分支。

Abstract: Accurate depth estimation is fundamental to 3D perception in autonomous driving, supporting tasks such as detection, tracking, and motion planning. However, monocular camera-based 3D detection suffers from depth ambiguity and reduced robustness under challenging conditions. Radar provides complementary advantages such as resilience to poor lighting and adverse weather, but its sparsity and low resolution limit its direct use in detection frameworks. This motivates the need for effective Radar-camera fusion with improved preprocessing and depth estimation strategies. We propose an end-to-end framework that enhances monocular 3D object detection through two key components. First, we introduce InstaRadar, an instance segmentation-guided expansion method that leverages pre-trained segmentation masks to enhance Radar density and semantic alignment, producing a more structured representation. InstaRadar achieves state-of-the-art results in Radar-guided depth estimation, showing its effectiveness in generating high-quality depth features. Second, we integrate the pre-trained RCDPT into the BEVDepth framework as a replacement for its depth module. With InstaRadar-enhanced inputs, the RCDPT integration consistently improves 3D detection performance. Overall, these components yield steady gains over the baseline BEVDepth model, demonstrating the effectiveness of InstaRadar and the advantage of explicit depth supervision in 3D object detection. Although the framework lags behind Radar-camera fusion models that directly extract BEV features, since Radar serves only as guidance rather than an independent feature stream, this limitation highlights potential for improvement. Future work will extend InstaRadar to point cloud-like representations and integrate a dedicated Radar branch with temporal cues for enhanced BEV fusion.

Abstract: We present Innovator-VL, a scientific multimodal large language model designed to advance understanding and reasoning across diverse scientific domains while maintaining excellent performance on general vision tasks. Contrary to the trend of relying on massive domain-specific pretraining and opaque pipelines, our work demonstrates that principled training design and transparent methodology can yield strong scientific intelligence with substantially reduced data requirements. (i) First, we provide a fully transparent, end-to-end reproducible training pipeline, covering data collection, cleaning, preprocessing, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and evaluation, along with detailed optimization recipes. This facilitates systematic extension by the community. (ii) Second, Innovator-VL exhibits remarkable data efficiency, achieving competitive performance on various scientific tasks using fewer than five million curated samples without large-scale pretraining. These results highlight that effective reasoning can be achieved through principled data selection rather than indiscriminate scaling. (iii) Third, Innovator-VL demonstrates strong generalization, achieving competitive performance on general vision, multimodal reasoning, and scientific benchmarks. This indicates that scientific alignment can be integrated into a unified model without compromising general-purpose capabilities. Our practices suggest that efficient, reproducible, and high-performing scientific multimodal models can be built even without large-scale data, providing a practical foundation for future research.

TL;DR: 该论文提出一种针对医学图像分割不确定性的区域化课程学习和帕累托一致性损失方法，通过优先学习确定区域、渐进加入不确定区域来优化训练稳定性，特别处理边界高模糊区域，在脑转移瘤和非转移性肿瘤分割中性能优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中不确定性分布不均，边界区域模糊度远高于内部区域。传统训练对所有像素一视同仁，导致早期预测不可靠时优化不稳定，阻碍模型收敛到帕累托最优解。

Method: 1) 区域化课程学习策略：优先学习确定区域，逐步纳入不确定区域以减少梯度方差；2) 帕累托一致性损失：自适应重塑损失面，平衡区域间不确定性权衡，约束内部与边界区域收敛动态；3) 模糊标注机制：在非边界区域保持二元置信度，边界处启用平滑过渡以稳定梯度和扩大损失平坦区域。

Result: 在脑转移瘤和非转移性肿瘤分割实验中，该方法在多种配置下均取得一致性改进，在所有肿瘤子区域上性能均优于传统清晰标签方法。

Conclusion: 通过区域化课程学习和帕累托一致性损失，能有效处理医学图像分割中非均匀分布的不确定性，特别是在边界区域，显著提升训练稳定性和分割精度，为模糊边界分割提供了创新的解决方案。

Abstract: Uncertainty in medical image segmentation is inherently non-uniform, with boundary regions exhibiting substantially higher ambiguity than interior areas. Conventional training treats all pixels equally, leading to unstable optimization during early epochs when predictions are unreliable. We argue that this instability hinders convergence toward Pareto-optimal solutions and propose a region-wise curriculum strategy that prioritizes learning from certain regions and gradually incorporates uncertain ones, reducing gradient variance. Methodologically, we introduce a Pareto-consistent loss that balances trade-offs between regional uncertainties by adaptively reshaping the loss landscape and constraining convergence dynamics between interior and boundary regions; this guides the model toward Pareto-approximate solutions. To address boundary ambiguity, we further develop a fuzzy labeling mechanism that maintains binary confidence in non-boundary areas while enabling smooth transitions near boundaries, stabilizing gradients, and expanding flat regions in the loss surface. Experiments on brain metastasis and non-metastatic tumor segmentation show consistent improvements across multiple configurations, with our method outperforming traditional crisp-set approaches in all tumor subregions.

Conclusion: 成功开发了大型、同行评议、开放访问的皮肤病理学图像数据集DermpathNet，并建立了半自动化的策展工作流程，可用于教育、交叉参考和机器学习目的。

Abstract: Accessing high-quality, open-access dermatopathology image datasets for learning and cross-referencing is a common challenge for clinicians and dermatopathology trainees. To establish a comprehensive open-access dermatopathology dataset for educational, cross-referencing, and machine-learning purposes, we employed a hybrid workflow to curate and categorize images from the PubMed Central (PMC) repository. We used specific keywords to extract relevant images, and classified them using a novel hybrid method that combined deep learning-based image modality classification with figure caption analyses. Validation on 651 manually annotated images demonstrated the robustness of our workflow, with an F-score of 89.6\% for the deep learning approach, 61.0\% for the keyword-based retrieval method, and 90.4\% for the hybrid approach. We retrieved over 7,772 images across 166 diagnoses and released this fully annotated dataset, reviewed by board-certified dermatopathologists. Using our dataset as a challenging task, we found the current image analysis algorithm from OpenAI inadequate for analyzing dermatopathology images. In conclusion, we have developed a large, peer-reviewed, open-access dermatopathology image dataset, DermpathNet, which features a semi-automated curation workflow.

Motivation: 当前AI生成图像检测方法多依赖二元分类，缺乏解释性和可信证据。现有基准虽收集了大量合成图像，但在伪影多样性和详尽的局部标注方面存在不足。

Method: 提出了细粒度可解释AI生成图像检测基准X-AIGD，提供像素级、分类的人工伪影标注（涵盖低层失真、高层语义、认知层反事实）。利用这些标注进行大量实验，评估现有检测器对伪影的依赖性及训练与注意力对齐的影响。

Result: 1. 现有检测器几乎不依赖可感知伪影，即使在最基础的失真层面；2. 训练检测器识别特定伪影时，决策仍严重依赖不可解读特征；3. 明确将模型注意力与伪影区域对齐可以提高检测器的可解释性和泛化性。

Conclusion: X-AIGD基准提供了丰富的伪影标注以支持可解释性评估，揭示了AIGI检测方法存在的问题，并为未来开发更可靠、可解释的检测器提供了方向。

Abstract: Current AI-Generated Image (AIGI) detection approaches predominantly rely on binary classification to distinguish real from synthetic images, often lacking interpretable or convincing evidence to substantiate their decisions. This limitation stems from existing AIGI detection benchmarks, which, despite featuring a broad collection of synthetic images, remain restricted in their coverage of artifact diversity and lack detailed, localized annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce a fine-grained benchmark towards eXplainable AI-Generated image Detection, named X-AIGD, which provides pixel-level, categorized annotations of perceptual artifacts, spanning low-level distortions, high-level semantics, and cognitive-level counterfactuals. These comprehensive annotations facilitate fine-grained interpretability evaluation and deeper insight into model decision-making processes. Our extensive investigation using X-AIGD provides several key insights: (1) Existing AIGI detectors demonstrate negligible reliance on perceptual artifacts, even at the most basic distortion level. (2) While AIGI detectors can be trained to identify specific artifacts, they still substantially base their judgment on uninterpretable features. (3) Explicitly aligning model attention with artifact regions can increase the interpretability and generalization of detectors. The data and code are available at: https://github.com/Coxy7/X-AIGD.

Abstract: Segmentation of the pubic symphysis and fetal head (PSFH) is a critical procedure in intrapartum monitoring and is essential for evaluating labor progression and identifying potential delivery complications. However, achieving accurate segmentation remains a significant challenge due to class imbalance, ambiguous boundaries, and noise interference in ultrasound images, compounded by the scarcity of high-quality annotated data. Current research on PSFH segmentation predominantly relies on CNN and Transformer architectures, leaving the potential of more powerful models underexplored. In this work, we propose a Dual-Student and Teacher framework combining CNN and SAM (DSTCS), which integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) into a dual student-teacher architecture. A cooperative learning mechanism between the CNN and SAM branches significantly improves segmentation accuracy. The proposed scheme also incorporates a specialized data augmentation strategy optimized for boundary processing and a novel loss function. Extensive experiments on the MICCAI 2023 and 2024 PSFH segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method exhibits superior robustness and significantly outperforms existing techniques, providing a reliable segmentation tool for clinical practice.

Abstract: Scenes are continuously undergoing dynamic changes in the real world. However, existing human-scene interaction generation methods typically treat the scene as static, which deviates from reality. Inspired by world models, we introduce Dyn-HSI, the first cognitive architecture for dynamic human-scene interaction, which endows virtual humans with three humanoid components. (1)Vision (human eyes): we equip the virtual human with a Dynamic Scene-Aware Navigation, which continuously perceives changes in the surrounding environment and adaptively predicts the next waypoint. (2)Memory (human brain): we equip the virtual human with a Hierarchical Experience Memory, which stores and updates experiential data accumulated during training. This allows the model to leverage prior knowledge during inference for context-aware motion priming, thereby enhancing both motion quality and generalization. (3) Control (human body): we equip the virtual human with Human-Scene Interaction Diffusion Model, which generates high-fidelity interaction motions conditioned on multimodal inputs. To evaluate performance in dynamic scenes, we extend the existing static human-scene interaction datasets to construct a dynamic benchmark, Dyn-Scenes. We conduct extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to validate Dyn-HSI, showing that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches and generates high-quality human-scene interaction motions in both static and dynamic settings.

TL;DR: 针对视频生成中静态采样策略（top-k/top-p）的不足，提出了一种基于熵引导的自适应采样方法ENkG，能够根据视频token的预测分布熵值动态调整候选集大小，提高视频生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归架构在LLMs中取得了显著成功，但在视频生成中，视频token具有语义密度低、时空冗余高的特点，这与语言token的特性形成鲜明对比。静态top-k/top-p采样策略在视频解码中效果不佳：对于低不确定性区域（如静态背景）会引入不必要的随机性，对于高不确定性区域（如前景物体）则容易因早期错误而陷入困境，这些预测误差会随着帧数的增加而累积，最终严重损害长时序生成质量。

Method: 提出ENkG（Entropy-Guided k-Guard）采样策略，这是一种简单有效的方法，通过量化每个token预测分布的熵值来指导采样。ENkG使用自适应的token候选集大小：对于低熵区域（预测分布集中），使用较少的候选以减少冗余噪音并保持结构完整性；对于高熵区域（预测分布分散），使用更多的候选以减轻误差累积。该方法与模型无关，无需训练，且几乎不增加额外计算开销。

Result: 实验结果表明，与静态top-k/top-p采样策略相比，ENkG在感知质量和结构稳定性方面都取得了持续一致的改进。

Conclusion: ENkG采样策略通过自适应调节采样候选集大小，有效解决了视频生成中因token特性差异导致的静态采样策略失效问题，提升了视频生成的长时序质量和稳定性，且具有模型无关性和低计算开销的优点。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) architectures have achieved significant successes in LLMs, inspiring explorations for video generation. In LLMs, top-p/top-k sampling strategies work exceptionally well: language tokens have high semantic density and low redundancy, so a fixed size of token candidates already strikes a balance between semantic accuracy and generation diversity. In contrast, video tokens have low semantic density and high spatio-temporal redundancy. This mismatch makes static top-k/top-p strategies ineffective for video decoders: they either introduce unnecessary randomness for low-uncertainty regions (static backgrounds) or get stuck in early errors for high-uncertainty regions (foreground objects). Prediction errors will accumulate as more frames are generated and eventually severely degrade long-horizon quality. To address this, we propose Entropy-Guided k-Guard (ENkG) sampling, a simple yet effective strategy that adapts sampling to token-wise dispersion, quantified by the entropy of each token's predicted distribution. ENkG uses adaptive token candidate sizes: for low-entropy regions, it employs fewer candidates to suppress redundant noise and preserve structural integrity; for high-entropy regions, it uses more candidates to mitigate error compounding. ENkG is model-agnostic, training-free, and adds negligible overhead. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in perceptual quality and structural stability compared to static top-k/top-p strategies.

Abstract: We present a fast 3DGS reconstruction pipeline designed to converge within one minute, developed for the SIGGRAPH Asia 3DGS Fast Reconstruction Challenge. The challenge consists of an initial round using SLAM-generated camera poses (with noisy trajectories) and a final round using COLMAP poses (highly accurate). To robustly handle these heterogeneous settings, we develop a two-stage solution. In the first round, we use reverse per-Gaussian parallel optimization and compact forward splatting based on Taming-GS and Speedy-splat, load-balanced tiling, an anchor-based Neural-Gaussian representation enabling rapid convergence with fewer learnable parameters, initialization from monocular depth and partially from feed-forward 3DGS models, and a global pose refinement module for noisy SLAM trajectories. In the final round, the accurate COLMAP poses change the optimization landscape; we disable pose refinement, revert from Neural-Gaussians back to standard 3DGS to eliminate MLP inference overhead, introduce multi-view consistency-guided Gaussian splitting inspired by Fast-GS, and introduce a depth estimator to supervise the rendered depth. Together, these techniques enable high-fidelity reconstruction under a strict one-minute budget. Our method achieved the top performance with a PSNR of 28.43 and ranked first in the competition.

Conclusion: Cor2Vox通过将图像生成与皮层结构先验相结合，能够生成生物学上合理、拓扑保真的合成神经影像数据，为解决真实数据集的关键限制提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Synthetic neuroimaging data can mitigate critical limitations of real-world datasets, including the scarcity of rare phenotypes, domain shifts across scanners, and insufficient longitudinal coverage. However, existing generative models largely rely on weak conditioning signals, such as labels or text, which lack anatomical grounding and often produce biologically implausible outputs. To this end, we introduce Cor2Vox, a cortex-grounded generative framework for brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) synthesis that ties image generation to continuous structural priors of the cerebral cortex. It leverages high-resolution cortical surfaces to guide a 3D shape-to-image Brownian bridge diffusion process, enabling topologically faithful synthesis and precise control over underlying anatomies. To support the generation of new, realistic brain shapes, we developed a large-scale statistical shape model of cortical morphology derived from over 33,000 UK Biobank scans. We validated the fidelity of Cor2Vox based on traditional image quality metrics, advanced cortical surface reconstruction, and whole-brain segmentation quality, outperforming many baseline methods. Across three applications, namely (i) anatomically consistent synthesis, (ii) simulation of progressive gray matter atrophy, and (iii) harmonization of in-house frontotemporal dementia scans with public datasets, Cor2Vox preserved fine-grained cortical morphology at the sub-voxel level, exhibiting remarkable robustness to variations in cortical geometry and disease phenotype without retraining.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Blind face restoration remains a persistent challenge due to the inherent ill-posedness of reconstructing holistic structures from severely constrained observations. Current generative approaches, while capable of synthesizing realistic textures, often suffer from information asymmetry -- the intrinsic disparity between the information-sparse low quality inputs and the information-dense high quality outputs. This imbalance leads to a one-to-many mapping, where insufficient constraints result in stochastic uncertainty and hallucinatory artifacts. To bridge this gap, we present \textbf{Pref-Restore}, a hierarchical framework that integrates discrete semantic logic with continuous texture generation to achieve deterministic, preference-aligned restoration. Our methodology fundamentally addresses this information disparity through two complementary strategies: (1) Augmenting Input Density: We employ an auto-regressive integrator to reformulate textual instructions into dense latent queries, injecting high-level semantic stability to constrain the degraded signals; (2) Pruning Output Distribution: We pioneer the integration of on-policy reinforcement learning directly into the diffusion restoration loop. By transforming human preferences into differentiable constraints, we explicitly penalize stochastic deviations, thereby sharpening the posterior distribution toward the desired high-fidelity outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Pref-Restore achieves state-of-the-art performance across synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Furthermore, empirical analysis confirms that our preference-aligned strategy significantly reduces solution entropy, establishing a robust pathway toward reliable and deterministic blind restoration.

Abstract: We introduce a novel motion capture system that reconstructs full-body 3D motion using only sparse pairwise distance (PWD) measurements from body-mounted(UWB) sensors. Using time-of-flight ranging between wireless nodes, our method eliminates the need for external cameras, enabling robust operation in uncontrolled and outdoor environments. Unlike traditional optical or inertial systems, our approach is shape-invariant and resilient to environmental constraints such as lighting and magnetic interference. At the core of our system is Wild-Poser (WiP for short), a compact, real-time Transformer-based architecture that directly predicts 3D joint positions from noisy or corrupted PWD measurements, which can later be used for joint rotation reconstruction via learned methods. WiP generalizes across subjects of varying morphologies, including non-human species, without requiring individual body measurements or shape fitting. Operating in real time, WiP achieves low joint position error and demonstrates accurate 3D motion reconstruction for both human and animal subjects in-the-wild. Our empirical analysis highlights its potential for scalable, low-cost, and general purpose motion capture in real-world settings.

Abstract: Sign language generation (SLG) aims to translate written texts into expressive sign motions, bridging communication barriers for the Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing communities. Recent studies formulate SLG within the language modeling framework using autoregressive language models, which suffer from unidirectional context modeling and slow token-by-token inference. To address these limitations, we present MaDiS, a masked-diffusion-based language model for SLG that captures bidirectional dependencies and supports efficient parallel multi-token generation. We further introduce a tri-level cross-modal pretraining scheme that jointly learns from token-, latent-, and 3D physical-space objectives, leading to richer and more grounded sign representations. To accelerate model convergence in the fine-tuning stage, we design a novel unmasking strategy with temporal checkpoints, reducing the combinatorial complexity of unmasking orders by over $10^{41}$ times. In addition, a mixture-of-parts embedding layer is developed to effectively fuse information stored in different part-wise sign tokens through learnable gates and well-optimized codebooks. Extensive experiments on CSL-Daily, Phoenix-2014T, and How2Sign demonstrate that MaDiS achieves superior performance across multiple metrics, including DTW error and two newly introduced metrics, SiBLEU and SiCLIP, while reducing inference latency by nearly 30%. Code and models will be released on our project page.

TL;DR: 提出了QuaMo（Quaternion Motions）方法，使用四元数微分方程(QDE)进行人体运动捕捉，解决了传统欧拉角方法的不连续性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于视觉的3D人体运动捕捉方法常忽略帧间时间一致性，导致运动抖动且不自然。现有基于运动学的方法依赖欧拉角，存在不连续性，尤其在在线设置中难以进行轨迹优化。四元数具有连续性，能产生更平滑的姿态过渡。

Method: 1) 采用状态空间模型，以四元数表示状态，使用四元数微分方程(QDE)描述四元数速度。2) 通过元PD控制器计算相应的角加速度，并引入创新的加速度增强机制，能自适应调节控制信号以应对快速姿态变化。3) 在四元数单位球约束下求解QDE，提高估计精度。

Result: 实验结果显示，提出的QDE与加速度增强方法能准确估计3D人体运动学，无连续性中断且不合理性最小。在Human3.6M、Fit3D、SportsPose和AIST等多个数据集上超越了同类最先进方法。

Conclusion: QuaMo方法通过四元数微分方程和自适应加速度增强，有效解决了运动捕捉中的不连续性问题，在多个标准数据集上取得了优越性能，为连续、稳定的3D人体运动捕捉提供了新思路。

Abstract: Vision-based 3D human motion capture from videos remains a challenge in computer vision. Traditional 3D pose estimation approaches often ignore the temporal consistency between frames, causing implausible and jittery motion. The emerging field of kinematics-based 3D motion capture addresses these issues by estimating the temporal transitioning between poses instead. A major drawback in current kinematics approaches is their reliance on Euler angles. Despite their simplicity, Euler angles suffer from discontinuity that leads to unstable motion reconstructions, especially in online settings where trajectory refinement is unavailable. Contrarily, quaternions have no discontinuity and can produce continuous transitions between poses. In this paper, we propose QuaMo, a novel Quaternion Motions method using quaternion differential equations (QDE) for human kinematics capture. We utilize the state-space model, an effective system for describing real-time kinematics estimations, with quaternion state and the QDE describing quaternion velocity. The corresponding angular acceleration is computed from a meta-PD controller with a novel acceleration enhancement that adaptively regulates the control signals as the human quickly changes to a new pose. Unlike previous work, our QDE is solved under the quaternion unit-sphere constraint that results in more accurate estimations. Experimental results show that our novel formulation of the QDE with acceleration enhancement accurately estimates 3D human kinematics with no discontinuity and minimal implausibilities. QuaMo outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets, namely Human3.6M, Fit3D, SportsPose and AIST. The code is available at https://github.com/cuongle1206/QuaMo

Abstract: Botulinum toxin (Botox) injections are the gold standard for managing facial asymmetry and aesthetic rejuvenation, yet determining the optimal dosage remains largely intuitive, often leading to suboptimal outcomes. We propose a localized latent editing framework that simulates Botulinum Toxin injection effects for injection planning through dose-response modeling. Our key contribution is a Region-Specific Latent Axis Discovery method that learns localized muscle relaxation trajectories in StyleGAN2's latent space, enabling precise control over specific facial regions without global side effects. By correlating these localized latent trajectories with injected toxin units, we learn a predictive dose-response model. We rigorously compare two approaches: direct metric regression versus image-based generative simulation on a clinical dataset of N=360 images from 46 patients. On a hold-out test set, our framework demonstrates moderate-to-strong structural correlations for geometric asymmetry metrics, confirming that the generative model correctly captures the direction of morphological changes. While biological variability limits absolute precision, we introduce a hybrid "Human-in-the-Loop" workflow where clinicians interactively refine simulations, bridging the gap between pathological reconstruction and cosmetic planning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent advances in video-audio (V-A) understanding and generation have increasingly relied on joint V-A embeddings, which serve as the foundation for tasks such as cross-modal retrieval and generation. While prior methods like CAVP effectively model semantic and temporal correspondences between modalities using contrastive objectives, their performance remains suboptimal. A key limitation is the insufficient modeling of the dense, multi-scale nature of both video and audio signals, correspondences often span fine- to coarse-grained spatial-temporal structures, which are underutilized in existing frameworks. To this end, we propose GMS-CAVP, a novel framework that combines Multi-Scale Video-Audio Alignment and Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal Diffusion-based pretraining objectives to enhance V-A correspondence modeling. First, GMS-CAVP introduces a multi-scale contrastive learning strategy that captures semantic and temporal relations across varying granularities. Second, we go beyond traditional contrastive learning by incorporating a diffusion-based generative objective, enabling modality translation and synthesis between video and audio. This unified discriminative-generative formulation facilitates deeper cross-modal understanding and paves the way for high-fidelity generation. Extensive experiments on VGGSound, AudioSet, and Panda70M demonstrate that GMS-CAVP outperforms previous methods in generation and retrieval.

Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) provides formal protection for sensitive data but typically incurs substantial losses in diagnostic performance. Model initialization has emerged as a critical factor in mitigating this degradation, yet the role of modern self-supervised learning under full-model DP remains poorly understood. Here, we present a large-scale evaluation of initialization strategies for differentially private medical image analysis, using chest radiograph classification as a representative benchmark with more than 800,000 images. Using state-of-the-art ConvNeXt models trained with DP-SGD across realistic privacy regimes, we compare non-domain-specific supervised ImageNet initialization, non-domain-specific self-supervised DINOv3 initialization, and domain-specific supervised pretraining on MIMIC-CXR, the largest publicly available chest radiograph dataset. Evaluations are conducted across five external datasets spanning diverse institutions and acquisition settings. We show that DINOv3 initialization consistently improves diagnostic utility relative to ImageNet initialization under DP, but remains inferior to domain-specific supervised pretraining, which achieves performance closest to non-private baselines. We further demonstrate that initialization choice strongly influences demographic fairness, cross-dataset generalization, and robustness to data scale and model capacity under privacy constraints. The results establish initialization strategy as a central determinant of utility, fairness, and generalization in differentially private medical imaging.

Abstract: Low-altitude vision systems are becoming a critical infrastructure for smart city governance. However, existing object-centric perception paradigms and loosely coupled vision-language pipelines are still difficult to support management-oriented anomaly understanding required in real-world urban governance. To bridge this gap, we introduce GovLA-10K, the first management-oriented multi-modal benchmark for low-altitude intelligence, along with GovLA-Reasoner, a unified vision-language reasoning framework tailored for governance-aware aerial perception. Unlike existing studies that aim to exhaustively annotate all visible objects, GovLA-10K is deliberately designed around functionally salient targets that directly correspond to practical management needs, and further provides actionable management suggestions grounded in these observations. To effectively coordinate the fine-grained visual grounding with high-level contextual language reasoning, GovLA-Reasoner introduces an efficient feature adapter that implicitly coordinates discriminative representation sharing between the visual detector and the large language model (LLM). Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves performance while avoiding the need of fine-tuning for any task-specific individual components. We believe our work offers a new perspective and foundation for future studies on management-aware low-altitude vision-language systems.

TL;DR: KeepLoRA使用梯度投影方法在ResNet参数空间中区分通用知识和任务特定知识，以解决持续学习中预训练模型在三重目标间的平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 持续学习需要同时平衡：1）保留预训练知识，2）保持已学习任务知识的记忆，3）维持获取新知识的可塑性。现有方法在这三个目标之间难以达到最优平衡。

Method: 1）分析发现通用知识位于参数空间的主成分子空间，任务特定知识位于残差子空间；2）提出KeepLoRA方法，将新任务的梯度投影到与预训练模型主成分和先前任务特征主导方向都正交的子空间；3）限制LoRA参数更新仅在残差子空间进行，避免干扰既有能力。

Result: 理论和实证分析表明KeepLoRA能有效平衡三个目标，在持续学习任务上取得了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: KeepLoRA通过参数空间分析和定向梯度投影，提供了一个简单有效的持续学习解决方案，在保留预训练知识、防止灾难性遗忘和保持可塑性之间实现了更好平衡。

Abstract: Continual learning for pre-trained vision-language models requires balancing three competing objectives: retaining pre-trained knowledge, preserving knowledge from a sequence of learned tasks, and maintaining the plasticity to acquire new knowledge. This paper presents a simple but effective approach called KeepLoRA to effectively balance these objectives. We first analyze the knowledge retention mechanism within the model parameter space and find that general knowledge is mainly encoded in the principal subspace, while task-specific knowledge is encoded in the residual subspace. Motivated by this finding, KeepLoRA learns new tasks by restricting LoRA parameter updates in the residual subspace to prevent interfering with previously learned capabilities. Specifically, we infuse knowledge for a new task by projecting its gradient onto a subspace orthogonal to both the principal subspace of pre-trained model and the dominant directions of previous task features. Our theoretical and empirical analyses confirm that KeepLoRA balances the three objectives and achieves state-of-the-art performance. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/MaolinLuo/KeepLoRA.

Abstract: In the literature, several studies have shown that state-of-the-art image similarity metrics are not perceptual metrics; moreover, they have difficulty evaluating images, especially when texture distortion is also present. In this work, we propose a new perceptual metric composed of two terms. The first term evaluates the dissimilarity between the textures of two images using Earth Mover's Distance. The second term evaluates the chromatic dissimilarity between two images in the Oklab perceptual color space. We evaluated the performance of our metric on a non-traditional dataset, called Berkeley-Adobe Perceptual Patch Similarity, which contains a wide range of complex distortions in shapes and colors. We have shown that our metric outperforms the state of the art, especially when images contain shape distortions, confirming also its greater perceptiveness. Furthermore, although deep black-box metrics could be very accurate, they only provide similarity scores between two images, without explaining their main differences and similarities. Our metric, on the other hand, provides visual explanations to support the calculated score, making the similarity assessment transparent and justified.

TL;DR: Video-KTR提出了一种模态感知的策略塑造框架，通过结合三种归因信号（视觉感知、时序敏感性和预测不确定性）进行细粒度的token级强化学习，以提升视频推理的准确性和可解释性。


<details>

Motivation: 现有视频推理方法依赖粗粒度的序列级奖励或单因素token选择，忽视了视觉输入、时序动态和语言输出之间的细粒度联系，限制了模型的准确性和可解释性。

Method: 提出Video-KTR框架，结合三种归因信号：(1) 通过反事实掩码识别视觉感知依赖的token；(2) 通过帧打乱检测时序敏感的token；(3) 利用高熵token标识预测不确定性。仅强化这些关键token，聚焦于语义信息丰富且模态敏感的内容。

Result: 在五个具有挑战性的基准测试中，Video-KTR取得了最先进或极具竞争力的结果，在Video-Holmes上达到42.7%（超越GPT-4o），在推理和通用视频理解任务上均显示出稳定提升。消融研究验证了各归因信号的互补作用和目标token级更新的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Video-KTR在提升准确性和可解释性的同时，为复杂视频推理提供了一种简单、即插即用的强化学习扩展方法，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown strong potential for enhancing reasoning in multimodal large language models, yet existing video reasoning methods often rely on coarse sequence-level rewards or single-factor token selection, neglecting fine-grained links among visual inputs, temporal dynamics, and linguistic outputs, limiting both accuracy and interpretability. We propose Video-KTR, a modality-aware policy shaping framework that performs selective, token-level RL by combining three attribution signals: (1) visual-aware tokens identified via counterfactual masking to reveal perceptual dependence; (2) temporal-aware tokens detected through frame shuffling to expose temporal sensitivity; and (3) high-entropy tokens signaling predictive uncertainty. By reinforcing only these key tokens, Video-KTR focuses learning on semantically informative, modality-sensitive content while filtering out low-value tokens. Across five challenging benchmarks, Video-KTR achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive results, achieving 42.7\% on Video-Holmes (surpassing GPT-4o) with consistent gains on both reasoning and general video understanding tasks. Ablation studies verify the complementary roles of the attribution signals and the robustness of targeted token-level updates. Overall, Video-KTR improves accuracy and interpretability, offering a simple, drop-in extension to RL for complex video reasoning.

Abstract: Vision Mamba models have been extensively researched in various fields, which address the limitations of previous models by effectively managing long-range dependencies with a linear-time overhead. Several prospective studies have further designed Vision Mamba based on UNet(VM-UNet) for medical image segmentation. These approaches primarily focus on optimizing architectural designs by creating more complex structures to enhance the model's ability to perceive semantic features. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach to improve the model by Dual Self-distillation for VM-UNet (DSVM-UNet) without any complex architectural designs. To achieve this goal, we develop double self-distillation methods to align the features at both the global and local levels. Extensive experiments conducted on the ISIC2017, ISIC2018, and Synapse benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: SWEET框架通过高效学习共享模板和轻量级缩放器参数，实现了对可变尺寸视觉模型的高质量初始化，解决了现有预训练方法的局限性

Abstract: The increasing scale and complexity of modern model parameters underscore the importance of pre-trained models. However, deployment often demands architectures of varying sizes, exposing limitations of conventional pre-training and fine-tuning. To address this, we propose SWEET, a self-supervised framework that performs constraint-based pre-training to enable scalable initialization in vision tasks. Instead of pre-training a fixed-size model, we learn a shared weight template and size-specific weight scalers under Tucker-based factorization, which promotes modularity and supports flexible adaptation to architectures with varying depths and widths. Target models are subsequently initialized by composing and reweighting the template through lightweight weight scalers, whose parameters can be efficiently learned from minimal training data. To further enhance flexibility in width expansion, we introduce width-wise stochastic scaling, which regularizes the template along width-related dimensions and encourages robust, width-invariant representations for improved cross-width generalization. Extensive experiments on \textsc{classification}, \textsc{detection}, \textsc{segmentation} and \textsc{generation} tasks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of SWEET for initializing variable-sized vision models.

Conclusion: WaterClear-GS是首个纯基于3DGS的框架，能够有效建模水下光学特性，在保持实时渲染的同时实现高质量的水下3D重建和外观恢复

Abstract: Underwater 3D reconstruction and appearance restoration are hindered by the complex optical properties of water, such as wavelength-dependent attenuation and scattering. Existing Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based methods struggle with slow rendering speeds and suboptimal color restoration, while 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) inherently lacks the capability to model complex volumetric scattering effects. To address these issues, we introduce WaterClear-GS, the first pure 3DGS-based framework that explicitly integrates underwater optical properties of local attenuation and scattering into Gaussian primitives, eliminating the need for an auxiliary medium network. Our method employs a dual-branch optimization strategy to ensure underwater photometric consistency while naturally recovering water-free appearances. This strategy is enhanced by depth-guided geometry regularization and perception-driven image loss, together with exposure constraints, spatially-adaptive regularization, and physically guided spectral regularization, which collectively enforce local 3D coherence and maintain natural visual perception. Experiments on standard benchmarks and our newly collected dataset demonstrate that WaterClear-GS achieves outstanding performance on both novel view synthesis (NVS) and underwater image restoration (UIR) tasks, while maintaining real-time rendering. The code will be available at https://buaaxrzhang.github.io/WaterClear-GS/.

Conclusion: PaW-ViT解决了耳部形态变化与Transformer位置敏感性之间的不匹配问题，为生物特征认证提供了有效方案。

Abstract: The rectangular tokens common to vision transformer methods for visual recognition can strongly affect performance of these methods due to incorporation of information outside the objects to be recognized. This paper introduces PaW-ViT, Patch-based Warping Vision Transformer, a preprocessing approach rooted in anatomical knowledge that normalizes ear images to enhance the efficacy of ViT. By accurately aligning token boundaries to detected ear feature boundaries, PaW-ViT obtains greater robustness to shape, size, and pose variation. By aligning feature boundaries to natural ear curvature, it produces more consistent token representations for various morphologies. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of PaW-ViT on various ViT models (ViT-T, ViT-S, ViT-B, ViT-L) and yield reasonable alignment robustness to variation in shape, size, and pose. Our work aims to solve the disconnect between ear biometric morphological variation and transformer architecture positional sensitivity, presenting a possible avenue for authentication schemes.

Abstract: 3D scene generation is a core technology for gaming, film/VFX, and VR/AR. Growing demand for rapid iteration, high-fidelity detail, and accessible content creation has further increased interest in this area. Existing methods broadly follow two paradigms - indirect 2D-to-3D reconstruction and direct 3D generation - but both are limited by weak structural modeling and heavy reliance on large-scale ground-truth supervision, often producing structural artifacts, geometric inconsistencies, and degraded high-frequency details in complex scenes. We propose GeoDiff3D, an efficient self-supervised framework that uses coarse geometry as a structural anchor and a geometry-constrained 2D diffusion model to provide texture-rich reference images. Importantly, GeoDiff3D does not require strict multi-view consistency of the diffusion-generated references and remains robust to the resulting noisy, inconsistent guidance. We further introduce voxel-aligned 3D feature aggregation and dual self-supervision to maintain scene coherence and fine details while substantially reducing dependence on labeled data. GeoDiff3D also trains with low computational cost and enables fast, high-quality 3D scene generation. Extensive experiments on challenging scenes show improved generalization and generation quality over existing baselines, offering a practical solution for accessible and efficient 3D scene construction.

Abstract: Ear occlusions (arising from the presence of ear accessories such as earrings and earphones) can negatively impact performance in ear-based biometric recognition systems, especially in unconstrained imaging circumstances. In this study, we assess the effectiveness of a diffusion-based ear inpainting technique as a pre-processing aid to mitigate the issues of ear accessory occlusions in transformer-based ear recognition systems. Given an input ear image and an automatically derived accessory mask, the inpainting model reconstructs clean and anatomically plausible ear regions by synthesizing missing pixels while preserving local geometric coherence along key ear structures, including the helix, antihelix, concha, and lobule. We evaluate the effectiveness of this pre-processing aid in transformer-based recognition systems for several vision transformer models and different patch sizes for a range of benchmark datasets. Experiments show that diffusion-based inpainting can be a useful pre-processing aid to alleviate ear accessory occlusions to improve overall recognition performance.

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements represented by Vision-Language Models (VLMs), current architectures often exhibit limitations in retaining fine-grained visual information, leading to coarse-grained multimodal comprehension. We attribute this deficiency to a suboptimal training paradigm inherent in prevailing VLMs, which exhibits a text-dominant optimization bias by conceptualizing visual signals merely as passive conditional inputs rather than supervisory targets. To mitigate this, we introduce Youtu-VL, a framework leveraging the Vision-Language Unified Autoregressive Supervision (VLUAS) paradigm, which fundamentally shifts the optimization objective from ``vision-as-input'' to ``vision-as-target.'' By integrating visual tokens directly into the prediction stream, Youtu-VL applies unified autoregressive supervision to both visual details and linguistic content. Furthermore, we extend this paradigm to encompass vision-centric tasks, enabling a standard VLM to perform vision-centric tasks without task-specific additions. Extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Youtu-VL achieves competitive performance on both general multimodal tasks and vision-centric tasks, establishing a robust foundation for the development of comprehensive generalist visual agents.

Abstract: Audio--Visual Question Answering (AVQA) is a challenging multimodal task that requires jointly reasoning over audio, visual, and textual information in a given video to answer natural language questions. Inspired by recent advances in Video QA, many existing AVQA approaches primarily focus on visual information processing, leveraging pre-trained models to extract object-level and motion-level representations. However, in those methods, the audio input is primarily treated as complementary to video analysis, and the textual question information contributes minimally to audio--visual understanding, as it is typically integrated only in the final stages of reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Query-guided Spatial--Temporal--Frequency (QSTar) interaction method, which effectively incorporates question-guided clues and exploits the distinctive frequency-domain characteristics of audio signals, alongside spatial and temporal perception, to enhance audio--visual understanding. Furthermore, we introduce a Query Context Reasoning (QCR) block inspired by prompting, which guides the model to focus more precisely on semantically relevant audio and visual features. Extensive experiments conducted on several AVQA benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving significant performance improvements over existing Audio QA, Visual QA, Video QA, and AVQA approaches. The code and pretrained models will be released after publication.

Conclusion: 双曲几何可以通过改善梯度稳定性和准确性来增强视觉变换器架构，相对简单的指数映射聚合机制能带来显著的实践效益。

Abstract: Data across modalities such as images, text, and graphs often contains hierarchical and relational structures, which are challenging to model within Euclidean geometry. Hyperbolic geometry provides a natural framework for representing such structures. Building on this property, this work introduces HexFormer, a hyperbolic vision transformer for image classification that incorporates exponential map aggregation within its attention mechanism. Two designs are explored: a hyperbolic ViT (HexFormer) and a hybrid variant (HexFormer-Hybrid) that combines a hyperbolic encoder with an Euclidean linear classification head. HexFormer incorporates a novel attention mechanism based on exponential map aggregation, which yields more accurate and stable aggregated representations than standard centroid based averaging, showing that simpler approaches retain competitive merit. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements over Euclidean baselines and prior hyperbolic ViTs, with the hybrid variant achieving the strongest overall results. Additionally, this study provides an analysis of gradient stability in hyperbolic transformers. The results reveal that hyperbolic models exhibit more stable gradients and reduced sensitivity to warmup strategies compared to Euclidean architectures, highlighting their robustness and efficiency in training. Overall, these findings indicate that hyperbolic geometry can enhance vision transformer architectures by improving gradient stability and accuracy. In addition, relatively simple mechanisms such as exponential map aggregation can provide strong practical benefits.

Abstract: Robust 3D hand reconstruction in egocentric vision is challenging due to depth ambiguity, self-occlusion, and complex hand-object interactions. Prior methods mitigate these issues by scaling training data or adding auxiliary cues, but they often struggle in unseen contexts. We present EgoHandICL, the first in-context learning (ICL) framework for 3D hand reconstruction that improves semantic alignment, visual consistency, and robustness under challenging egocentric conditions. EgoHandICL introduces complementary exemplar retrieval guided by vision-language models (VLMs), an ICL-tailored tokenizer for multimodal context, and a masked autoencoder (MAE)-based architecture trained with hand-guided geometric and perceptual objectives. Experiments on ARCTIC and EgoExo4D show consistent gains over state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate real-world generalization and improve EgoVLM hand-object interaction reasoning by using reconstructed hands as visual prompts.

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) rely on fixed-size kernels scanning local patches, which limits their ability to capture global context or long-range dependencies without very deep architectures. Vision Transformers (ViTs), in turn, provide global connectivity but lack spatial inductive bias, depend on explicit positional encodings, and remain tied to the initial patch size. Bridging these limitations requires a representation that is both structured and global. We introduce SONIC (Spectral Oriented Neural Invariant Convolutions), a continuous spectral parameterisation that models convolutional operators using a small set of shared, orientation-selective components. These components define smooth responses across the full frequency domain, yielding global receptive fields and filters that adapt naturally across resolutions. Across synthetic benchmarks, large-scale image classification, and 3D medical datasets, SONIC shows improved robustness to geometric transformations, noise, and resolution shifts, and matches or exceeds convolutional, attention-based, and prior spectral architectures with an order of magnitude fewer parameters. These results demonstrate that continuous, orientation-aware spectral parameterisations provide a principled and scalable alternative to conventional spatial and spectral operators.

Abstract: We present VGGT-SLAM 2.0, a real time RGB feed-forward SLAM system which substantially improves upon VGGT-SLAM for incrementally aligning submaps created from VGGT. Firstly, we remove high-dimensional 15-degree-of-freedom drift and planar degeneracy from VGGT-SLAM by creating a new factor graph design while still addressing the reconstruction ambiguity of VGGT given unknown camera intrinsics. Secondly, by studying the attention layers of VGGT, we show that one of the layers is well suited to assist in image retrieval verification for free without additional training, which enables both rejecting false positive matches and allows for completing more loop closures. Finally, we conduct a suite of experiments which includes showing VGGT-SLAM 2.0 can easily be adapted for open-set object detection and demonstrating real time performance while running online onboard a ground robot using a Jetson Thor. We also test in environments ranging from cluttered indoor apartments and office scenes to a 4,200 square foot barn, and we also demonstrate VGGT-SLAM 2.0 achieves the highest accuracy on the TUM dataset with about 23 percent less pose error than VGGT-SLAM.

Abstract: Arabic calligraphy represents one of the richest visual traditions of the Arabic language, blending linguistic meaning with artistic form. Although multimodal models have advanced across languages, their ability to process Arabic script, especially in artistic and stylized calligraphic forms, remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we present DuwatBench, a benchmark of 1,272 curated samples containing about 1,475 unique words across six classical and modern calligraphic styles, each paired with sentence-level detection annotations. The dataset reflects real-world challenges in Arabic writing, such as complex stroke patterns, dense ligatures, and stylistic variations that often challenge standard text recognition systems. Using DuwatBench, we evaluated 13 leading Arabic and multilingual multimodal models and showed that while they perform well on clean text, they struggle with calligraphic variation, artistic distortions, and precise visual-text alignment. By publicly releasing DuwatBench and its annotations, we aim to advance culturally grounded multimodal research, foster fair inclusion of the Arabic language and visual heritage in AI systems, and support continued progress in this area. Our dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/MBZUAI/DuwatBench) and evaluation suit (https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/DuwatBench) are publicly available.

TL;DR: 该论文提出一种名为NavFormer的新型IGRF地磁场强度预测方法，通过旋转不变标量特征和规范SPD模块来解决传统三轴磁力计读数随传感器姿态变化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自主导航中，IGRF总强度随传感器姿态变化而保持不变，然而传统的三轴磁力计组件读数会在传感器朝向不同时发生变化，这给预测带来了挑战。NavFormer方法旨在解决这一不连续性问题，以实现更准确、更具泛化能力的地磁场预测。

Method: NavFormer基于旋转不变标量特征，设计了一个规范SPD模块，通过构建各窗口的格拉姆矩阵形成规范坐标系，并在原始坐标系中进行状态依赖的谱缩放，从而在不产生符号不连续性的前提下，稳定三轴磁力计窗口级二阶矩的谱。该方法在飞行实验中表现出出色的预测能力。

Result: NavFormer在五组飞行实验数据上进行评估，结果显示在标准训练、少量样本训练和零样本迁移等任务中，均优于已有基准方法，表现出更低的预测误差和更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: NavFormer是一种新型稳健、泛化能力强的IGRF预测方法，其代码已开源且实验证明在多种场景下均能取得优于现有模型的性能，为自主导航系统提供了更好的磁力数据预测解决方案。

Abstract: Triad magnetometer components change with sensor attitude even when the IGRF total intensity target stays invariant. NavFormer forecasts this invariant target with rotation invariant scalar features and a Canonical SPD module that stabilizes the spectrum of window level second moments of the triads without sign discontinuities. The module builds a canonical frame from a Gram matrix per window and applies state dependent spectral scaling in the original coordinates. Experiments across five flights show lower error than strong baselines in standard training, few shot training, and zero shot transfer.

Abstract: This paper presents a Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) solution to the dynamic portfolio optimization problem based on Variational Quantum Circuits. The implemented QRL approaches are quantum analogues of the classical neural-network-based Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient and Deep Q-Network algorithms. Through an empirical evaluation on real-world financial data, we show that our quantum agents achieve risk-adjusted performance comparable to, and in some cases exceeding, that of classical Deep RL models with several orders of magnitude more parameters. In addition to improved parameter efficiency, quantum agents exhibit reduced variability across market regimes, indicating robust behaviour under changing conditions. However, while quantum circuit execution is inherently fast at the hardware level, practical deployment on cloud-based quantum systems introduces substantial latency, making end-to-end runtime currently dominated by infrastructural overhead and limiting practical applicability. Taken together, our results suggest that QRL is theoretically competitive with state-of-the-art classical reinforcement learning and may become practically advantageous as deployment overheads diminish. This positions QRL as a promising paradigm for dynamic decision-making in complex, high-dimensional, and non-stationary environments such as financial markets.

TL;DR: 本文针对VAE在高维隐空间中的异常检测问题，提出了基于超球坐标的隐变量建模方法，通过将隐向量压缩到超球面的特定方向来提升后验分布的表达能力，从而改善无监督和分布外异常检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统变分自编码器（VAE）在高维隐空间中存在两个主要问题：1）隐空间的超体积随维度指数增长，严重影响生成能力；2）在标准VAE中，隐向量分布在超球面的“赤道”区域，这使得检测异常向量变得困难。为了克服这些限制，需要开发一种能更有效表征隐空间结构的改进方法。

Method: 作者提出将VAE的隐变量用超球坐标（hyperspherical coordinates）表示，这种方法允许将隐向量压缩到超球面的特定方向上。通过这种坐标变换，模型可以获得更具表达能力的近似后验分布，从而更好地捕捉数据的分布特征并区分异常样本。

Result: 该方法在多个数据集上取得了最佳性能：1）无监督异常检测方面：在火星漫游车相机拍摄的异常地貌检测和地面望远镜拍摄的异常星系检测等复杂真实世界数据集上表现优异；2）分布外异常检测方面：在Cifar10和ImageNet子集等标准基准测试中都超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: 使用超球坐标表示VAE隐变量能有效应对高维隐空间的挑战，通过压缩隐向量方向来增强后验分布的表达能力，显著提升了VAE在无监督和分布外异常检测任务中的性能，为高维统计场景下的异常检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Variational autoencoders (VAE) encode data into lower-dimensional latent vectors before decoding those vectors back to data. Once trained, one can hope to detect out-of-distribution (abnormal) latent vectors, but several issues arise when the latent space is high dimensional. This includes an exponential growth of the hypervolume with the dimension, which severely affects the generative capacity of the VAE. In this paper, we draw insights from high dimensional statistics: in these regimes, the latent vectors of a standard VAE are distributed on the `equators' of a hypersphere, challenging the detection of anomalies. We propose to formulate the latent variables of a VAE using hyperspherical coordinates, which allows compressing the latent vectors towards a given direction on the hypersphere, thereby allowing for a more expressive approximate posterior. We show that this improves both the fully unsupervised and OOD anomaly detection ability of the VAE, achieving the best performance on the datasets we considered, outperforming existing methods. For the unsupervised and OOD modalities, respectively, these are: i) detecting unusual landscape from the Mars Rover camera and unusual Galaxies from ground based imagery (complex, real world datasets); ii) standard benchmarks like Cifar10 and subsets of ImageNet as the in-distribution (ID) class.

Abstract: High-dimensional datasets are increasingly common across scientific and industrial domains, yet they remain difficult to cluster effectively due to the diminishing usefulness of distance metrics and the tendency of clusters to collapse or overlap when projected into lower dimensions. Traditional dimensionality reduction techniques generate static 2D or 3D embeddings that provide limited interpretability and do not offer a mechanism to leverage the analyst's intuition during exploration. To address this gap, we propose Interactive Project-Based Clustering (IPBC), a framework that reframes clustering as an iterative human-guided visual analysis process. IPBC integrates a nonlinear projection module with a feedback loop that allows users to modify the embedding by adjusting viewing angles and supplying simple constraints such as must-link or cannot-link relationships. These constraints reshape the objective of the projection model, gradually pulling semantically related points closer together and pushing unrelated points further apart. As the projection becomes more structured and expressive through user interaction, a conventional clustering algorithm operating on the optimized 2D layout can more reliably identify distinct groups. An additional explainability component then maps each discovered cluster back to the original feature space, producing interpretable rules or feature rankings that highlight what distinguishes each cluster. Experiments on various benchmark datasets show that only a small number of interactive refinement steps can substantially improve cluster quality. Overall, IPBC turns clustering into a collaborative discovery process in which machine representation and human insight reinforce one another.

Abstract: Multi-channel time-series data, prevalent across diverse applications, is characterized by significant heterogeneity in its different channels. However, existing forecasting models are typically guided by channel-agnostic loss functions like MSE, which apply a uniform metric across all channels. This often leads to fail to capture channel-specific dynamics such as sharp fluctuations or trend shifts. To address this, we propose a Channel-wise Perceptual Loss (CP Loss). Its core idea is to learn a unique perceptual space for each channel that is adapted to its characteristics, and to compute the loss within this space. Specifically, we first design a learnable channel-wise filter that decomposes the raw signal into disentangled multi-scale representations, which form the basis of our perceptual space. Crucially, the filter is optimized jointly with the main forecasting model, ensuring that the learned perceptual space is explicitly oriented towards the prediction task. Finally, losses are calculated within these perception spaces to optimize the model. Code is available at https://github.com/zyh16143998882/CP_Loss.

Abstract: Accurate multi-label classification of electrocardiogram (ECG) signals remains challenging due to the coexistence of multiple cardiac conditions, pronounced class imbalance, and long-range temporal dependencies in multi-lead recordings. Although recent studies increasingly rely on deep and stacked recurrent architectures, the necessity and clinical justification of such architectural complexity have not been rigorously examined. In this work, we perform a systematic comparative evaluation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) combined with multiple recurrent configurations, including LSTM, GRU, Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM), and their stacked variants, for multi-label ECG classification on the PTB-XL dataset comprising 23 diagnostic categories. The CNN component serves as a morphology-driven baseline, while recurrent layers are progressively integrated to assess their contribution to temporal modeling and generalization performance. Experimental results indicate that a CNN integrated with a single BiLSTM layer achieves the most favorable trade-off between predictive performance and model complexity. This configuration attains superior Hamming loss (0.0338), macro-AUPRC (0.4715), micro-F1 score (0.6979), and subset accuracy (0.5723) compared with deeper recurrent combinations. Although stacked recurrent models occasionally improve recall for specific rare classes, our results provide empirical evidence that increasing recurrent depth yields diminishing returns and may degrade generalization due to reduced precision and overfitting. These findings suggest that architectural alignment with the intrinsic temporal structure of ECG signals, rather than increased recurrent depth, is a key determinant of robust performance and clinically relevant deployment.

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute enhances long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, yet existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off between computational cost and coverage quality: either incurring high training expense or yielding redundant trajectories. We introduce The Geometric Reasoner (TGR), a training-free framework that performs manifold-informed latent foresight search under strict memory bounds. At each chunk boundary, TGR scores candidate latent anchors via a lightweight look-ahead estimate combined with soft geometric regularizers that encourage smooth trajectories and diverse exploration. Chunk-wise KV cache resets keep memory linear in chunk length. On challenging math and code benchmarks, TGR improves robust trajectory coverage, measured by the area under the Pass@$k$ curve (AUC), by up to 13 points on Qwen3-8B, with negligible overhead of about 1.1--1.3 times.

Abstract: Markov decision problems are most commonly solved via dynamic programming. Another approach is Bellman residual minimization, which directly minimizes the squared Bellman residual objective function. However, compared to dynamic programming, this approach has received relatively less attention, mainly because it is often less efficient in practice and can be more difficult to extend to model-free settings such as reinforcement learning. Nonetheless, Bellman residual minimization has several advantages that make it worth investigating, such as more stable convergence with function approximation for value functions. While Bellman residual methods for policy evaluation have been widely studied, methods for policy optimization (control tasks) have been scarcely explored. In this paper, we establish foundational results for the control Bellman residual minimization for policy optimization.

Motivation: 传统消息传递GNN在低同配性图上表现不佳，但同配性本身不能完全解释这一现象，因为相同同配性水平的图可能表现差异显著。标签信息性（相邻节点标签间的互信息）能更准确地刻画图结构何时有用

Method: 建立连接曲率引导重连与位置几何的统一理论框架，实例化为几何感知架构ASEHybrid（使用Forman曲率和拉普拉斯位置编码），分析调整同配性和标签信息性在拉普拉斯平滑下的谱行为

Result: 理论上：1）证明几何感知GNN优于仅特征基线的充要条件是图结构携带超越节点特征的标签相关信息；2）证明基于度的Forman曲率不增加一维WL测试之外的表达能力，而是重塑信息流；3）建立曲率引导重连过程的收敛和Lipschitz稳定性保证。实证上：在Chameleon、Squirrel等数据集上实验，在标签信息性异配基准（图结构提供超越特征的标签相关信息）上获得增益，在基线较高区域无显著改进

Conclusion: 研究工作为几何感知GNN的性能提升提供了理论解释和实用指南，表明标签信息性是比同配性更本质的性能决定因素，曲率引导重连主要作用是优化信息流而非增加表达能力

Abstract: Standard message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs) often struggle on graphs with low homophily, yet homophily alone does not explain this behavior, as graphs with similar homophily levels can exhibit markedly different performance and some heterophilous graphs remain easy for vanilla GCNs. Recent work suggests that label informativeness (LI), the mutual information between labels of adjacent nodes, provides a more faithful characterization of when graph structure is useful. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical framework that connects curvature-guided rewiring and positional geometry through the lens of label informativeness, and instantiate it in a practical geometry-aware architecture, ASEHybrid. Our analysis provides a necessary-and-sufficient characterization of when geometry-aware GNNs can improve over feature-only baselines: such gains are possible if and only if graph structure carries label-relevant information beyond node features. Theoretically, we relate adjusted homophily and label informativeness to the spectral behavior of label signals under Laplacian smoothing, show that degree-based Forman curvature does not increase expressivity beyond the one-dimensional Weisfeiler--Lehman test but instead reshapes information flow, and establish convergence and Lipschitz stability guarantees for a curvature-guided rewiring process. Empirically, we instantiate ASEHybrid using Forman curvature and Laplacian positional encodings and conduct controlled ablations on Chameleon, Squirrel, Texas, Tolokers, and Minesweeper, observing gains precisely on label-informative heterophilous benchmarks where graph structure provides label-relevant information beyond node features, and no meaningful improvement in high-baseline regimes.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种两阶段预测-优化库存规划方法，包含全局多期预测模型和成本感知的订购策略，在VN2竞赛中获胜。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零售链库存规划需要将需求预测转化为订购决策，同时考虑不对称的缺货成本和持有成本。VN2库存规划挑战将这一场景形式化为具有两周交货周期的每周决策循环。

Method: 1. 预测阶段：使用CatBoost实现的GBDT全局模型进行多期预测，采用缺货感知特征工程处理缺货期间的需求，每序列缩放关注模式而非绝对水平，时间权重反映需求变化
2. 优化阶段：将库存投影到交货周初，计算明确权衡缺货和持有成本的目标库存水平

Result: 在官方竞赛模拟的六轮评估中获得第一名，通过强大的全局预测模型结合轻量级成本感知策略实现最优表现。

Conclusion: 该方法虽然针对VN2场景开发，但可扩展到实际应用和其他运营约束，为零售库存规划提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Inventory planning for retail chains requires translating demand forecasts into ordering decisions, including asymmetric shortages and holding costs. The VN2 Inventory Planning Challenge formalizes this setting as a weekly decision-making cycle with a two-week product delivery lead time, where the total cost is defined as the shortage cost plus the holding cost. This report presents the winning VN2 solution: a two-stage predict-then-optimize pipeline that combines a single global multi-horizon forecasting model with a cost-aware ordering policy. The forecasting model is trained in a global paradigm, jointly using all available time series. A gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) model implemented in CatBoost is used as the base learner. The model incorporates stockout-aware feature engineering to address censored demand during out-of-stock periods, per-series scaling to focus learning on time-series patterns rather than absolute levels, and time-based observation weights to reflect shifts in demand patterns. In the decision stage, inventory is projected to the start of the delivery week, and a target stock level is calculated that explicitly trades off shortage and holding costs. Evaluated by the official competition simulation in six rounds, the solution achieved first place by combining a strong global forecasting model with a lightweight cost-aware policy. Although developed for the VN2 setting, the proposed approach can be extended to real-world applications and additional operational constraints.

Abstract: We are interested in enabling autonomous agents to learn and reason about systems with hidden states, such as furniture with hidden locking mechanisms. We cast this problem as learning the parameters of a discrete Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). The agent begins with knowledge of the POMDP's actions and observation spaces, but not its state space, transitions, or observation models. These properties must be constructed from action-observation sequences. Spectral approaches to learning models of partially observable domains, such as learning Predictive State Representations (PSRs), are known to directly estimate the number of hidden states. These methods cannot, however, yield direct estimates of transition and observation likelihoods, which are important for many downstream reasoning tasks. Other approaches leverage tensor decompositions to estimate transition and observation likelihoods but often assume full state observability and full-rank transition matrices for all actions. To relax these assumptions, we study how PSRs learn transition and observation matrices up to a similarity transform, which may be estimated via tensor methods. Our method learns observation matrices and transition matrices up to a partition of states, where the states in a single partition have the same observation distributions corresponding to actions whose transition matrices are full-rank. Our experiments suggest that these partition-level transition models learned by our method, with a sufficient amount of data, meets the performance of PSRs as models to be used by standard sampling-based POMDP solvers. Furthermore, the explicit observation and transition likelihoods can be leveraged to specify planner behavior after the model has been learned.

Abstract: Imputing missing node features in graphs is challenging, particularly under high missing rates. Existing methods based on latent representations or global diffusion often fail to produce reliable estimates, and may propagate errors across the graph. We propose FSD-CAP, a two-stage framework designed to improve imputation quality under extreme sparsity. In the first stage, a graph-distance-guided subgraph expansion localizes the diffusion process. A fractional diffusion operator adjusts propagation sharpness based on local structure. In the second stage, imputed features are refined using class-aware propagation, which incorporates pseudo-labels and neighborhood entropy to promote consistency. We evaluated FSD-CAP on multiple datasets. With $99.5\%$ of features missing across five benchmark datasets, FSD-CAP achieves average accuracies of $80.06\%$ (structural) and $81.01\%$ (uniform) in node classification, close to the $81.31\%$ achieved by a standard GCN with full features. For link prediction under the same setting, it reaches AUC scores of $91.65\%$ (structural) and $92.41\%$ (uniform), compared to $95.06\%$ for the fully observed case. Furthermore, FSD-CAP demonstrates superior performance on both large-scale and heterophily datasets when compared to other models.

Abstract: Quantum hardware suffers from intrinsic device heterogeneity and environmental drift, forcing practitioners to choose between suboptimal non-adaptive controllers or costly per-device recalibration. We derive a scaling law lower bound for meta-learning showing that the adaptation gain (expected fidelity improvement from task-specific gradient steps) saturates exponentially with gradient steps and scales linearly with task variance, providing a quantitative criterion for when adaptation justifies its overhead. Validation on quantum gate calibration shows negligible benefits for low-variance tasks but $>40\%$ fidelity gains on two-qubit gates under extreme out-of-distribution conditions (10$\times$ the training noise), with implications for reducing per-device calibration time on cloud quantum processors. Further validation on classical linear-quadratic control confirms these laws emerge from general optimization geometry rather than quantum-specific physics. Together, these results offer a transferable framework for decision-making in adaptive control.

Motivation: 传统的大语言模型行为对齐方法通常采用广泛的微调，但这会导致分布偏移和可解释性差等副作用，需要大量数据且不够精确

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器和线性探针来识别与目标行为最相关的MLP神经元（约3%），将它们解码到残差空间，并通过梯度掩码仅对这些神经元进行微调

Result: 在减少奉承行为的任务中，该方法在四个基准测试（Syco-Bench、NLP、POLI、PHIL）上匹配或超越最先进性能，使用Gemma-2-2B和9B模型，在数据有限时仍有效

Conclusion: 稀疏的神经元级更新为全模型微调提供了一个可扩展且精确的替代方案，特别适用于可用数据较少的情况

Abstract: Behavioral alignment in large language models (LLMs) is often achieved through broad fine-tuning, which can result in undesired side effects like distributional shift and low interpretability. We propose a method for alignment that identifies and updates only the neurons most responsible for a given behavior, a targeted approach that allows for fine-tuning with significantly less data. Using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and linear probes, we isolate the 3% of MLP neurons most predictive of a target behavior, decode them into residual space, and fine-tune only those neurons using gradient masking. We demonstrate this approach on the task of reducing sycophantic behavior, where our method matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks (Syco-Bench, NLP, POLI, PHIL) using Gemma-2-2B and 9B models. Our results show that sparse, neuron-level updates offer a scalable and precise alternative to full-model fine-tuning, remaining effective even in situations when little data is available

Abstract: We propose an (offline) multi-dimensional distributional reinforcement learning framework (KE-DRL) that leverages Hilbert space mappings to estimate the kernel mean embedding of the multi-dimensional value distribution under a proposed target policy. In our setting, the state-action variables are multi-dimensional and continuous. By mapping probability measures into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space via kernel mean embeddings, our method replaces Wasserstein metrics with an integral probability metric. This enables efficient estimation in multi-dimensional state-action spaces and reward settings, where direct computation of Wasserstein distances is computationally challenging. Theoretically, we establish contraction properties of the distributional Bellman operator under our proposed metric involving the Matern family of kernels and provide uniform convergence guarantees. Simulations and empirical results demonstrate robust off-policy evaluation and recovery of the kernel mean embedding under mild assumptions, namely, Lipschitz continuity and boundedness of the kernels, highlighting the potential of embedding-based approaches in complex real-world decision-making scenarios and risk evaluation.

Abstract: Realizing high-throughput aberration-corrected Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) exploration of atomic structures requires rapid tuning of multipole probe correctors while compensating for the inevitable drift of the optical column. While automated alignment routines exist, conventional approaches rely on serial, gradient-free searches (e.g., Nelder-Mead) that are sample-inefficient and struggle to correct multiple interacting parameters simultaneously. Conversely, emerging deep learning methods offer speed but often lack the flexibility to adapt to varying sample conditions without extensive retraining. Here, we introduce a Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) framework for rapid, data-efficient aberration correction. Importantly, this framework does not prescribe a single notion of image quality; instead, it enables user-defined, physically motivated reward formulations (e.g., symmetry-induced objectives) and uses Pareto fronts to expose the resulting trade-offs between competing experimental priorities. By using Gaussian Process regression to model the aberration landscape probabilistically, our workflow actively selects the most informative lens settings to evaluate next, rather than performing an exhaustive blind search. We demonstrate that this active learning loop is more robust than traditional optimization algorithms and effectively tunes focus, astigmatism, and higher-order aberrations. By balancing competing objectives, this approach enables "self-optimizing" microscopy by dynamically sustaining optimal performance during experiments.

Motivation: Schrodinger Bridge and Bass (SBB)作为经典Schrodinger Bridge的扩展，同时控制漂移和波动性，但需要高效的求解算法。研究旨在开发一个可扩展、高性能的SBB求解器。

Method: 提出LightsBB-M算法，利用SBB目标的双重表示获得最优漂移和波动性的解析表达式，引入参数β（β>0）在纯漂移和纯波动性之间插值。

Abstract: The Schrodinger Bridge and Bass (SBB) formulation, which jointly controls drift and volatility, is an established extension of the classical Schrodinger Bridge (SB). Building on this framework, we introduce LightSBB-M, an algorithm that computes the optimal SBB transport plan in only a few iterations. The method exploits a dual representation of the SBB objective to obtain analytic expressions for the optimal drift and volatility, and it incorporates a tunable parameter beta greater than zero that interpolates between pure drift (the Schrodinger Bridge) and pure volatility (Bass martingale transport). We show that LightSBB-M achieves the lowest 2-Wasserstein distance on synthetic datasets against state-of-the-art SB and diffusion baselines with up to 32 percent improvement. We also illustrate the generative capability of the framework on an unpaired image-to-image translation task (adult to child faces in FFHQ). These findings demonstrate that LightSBB-M provides a scalable, high-fidelity SBB solver that outperforms existing SB and diffusion baselines across both synthetic and real-world generative tasks.

Abstract: The transition from monolithic to multi-component neural architectures in advanced neural network controllers poses substantial challenges due to the high computational complexity of the latter. Conventional model compression techniques for complexity reduction, such as structured pruning based on norm-based metrics to estimate the relative importance of distinct parameter groups, often fail to capture functional significance. This paper introduces a component-aware pruning framework that utilizes gradient information to compute three distinct importance metrics during training: Gradient Accumulation, Fisher Information, and Bayesian Uncertainty. Experimental results with an autoencoder and a TD-MPC agent demonstrate that the proposed framework reveals critical structural dependencies and dynamic shifts in importance that static heuristics often miss, supporting more informed compression decisions.

Motivation: 随着电网中物联网测量设备的广泛部署，虚假数据注入攻击（FDIAs）严重威胁系统运行安全。现有检测方法主要依赖图学习，但存在高维表示、浅层分类器、局部结构依赖和全局上下文关系建模不足等问题，且直接使用Transformer可能导致深度过大、无法有效捕捉局部电网动态。

Method: 提出一种联合检测与定位框架，整合自回归移动平均（ARMA）图卷积滤波器和仅编码器Transformer架构。ARMA图滤波器提供鲁棒、拓扑感知的特征提取，适应频谱突变；Transformer编码器利用自注意力捕捉电网元件间的长程依赖，同时保留关键局部上下文。

Conclusion: 结合ARMA图卷积滤波器和Transformer编码器的框架能够有效捕获电网的局部结构依赖与全局上下文关系，显著提升虚假数据注入攻击的检测与定位性能，为电网安全防护提供了新思路。

Abstract: The increasing deployment of Internet-of-Things (IoT)-enabled measurement devices in modern power systems has expanded the cyberattack surface of the grid. As a result, this critical infrastructure is increasingly exposed to cyberattacks, including false data injection attacks (FDIAs) that compromise measurement integrity and threaten reliable system operation. Existing FDIA detection methods primarily exploit spatial correlations and network topology using graph-based learning; however, these approaches often rely on high-dimensional representations and shallow classifiers, limiting their ability to capture local structural dependencies and global contextual relationships. Moreover, naively incorporating Transformer architectures can result in overly deep models that struggle to model localized grid dynamics. This paper proposes a joint FDIA detection and localization framework that integrates auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) graph convolutional filters with an Encoder-Only Transformer architecture. The ARMA-based graph filters provide robust, topology-aware feature extraction and adaptability to abrupt spectral changes, while the Transformer encoder leverages self-attention to capture long-range dependencies among grid elements without sacrificing essential local context. The proposed method is evaluated using real-world load data from the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) applied to the IEEE 14- and 300-bus systems. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively exploits both the state and topology of the power grid, achieving high accuracy in detecting FDIA events and localizing compromised nodes.

TL;DR: VPPO 提出了一种新的强化学习方法，通过定位推理路径中的第一个错误来改进对语言模型的奖励分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法依赖稀疏结果奖励，无法正确评估部分成功解决方案中的中间步骤。过程奖励模型（PRM）虽提供细粒度步骤监督，但其得分通常嘈杂且难以评估。此外，最新的 PRM 基准测试关注检测推理路径中的第一个错误步骤，这与 PRM 在强化学习中的典型使用方式（将其步骤分数视为原始奖励）不一致。

Method: VPPO 利用 PRM 仅定位强化学习过程中的第一个错误。给定一个不正确的 rollout，VPPO 根据检测到的第一个错误将轨迹划分为已验证的正确前缀和错误后缀，奖励前者，仅在检测到的错误后施加定向惩罚。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，VPPO 在 Pass@1 和 Pass@K 指标上始终优于稀疏奖励强化学习和先前的 PRM 引导基线。

Conclusion: VPPO 通过更稳定、可解释的学习信号改进了信用分配，显著提升了语言模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful framework for improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, most existing RL approaches rely on sparse outcome rewards, which fail to credit correct intermediate steps in partially successful solutions. Process reward models (PRMs) offer fine-grained step-level supervision, but their scores are often noisy and difficult to evaluate. As a result, recent PRM benchmarks focus on a more objective capability: detecting the first incorrect step in a reasoning path. However, this evaluation target is misaligned with how PRMs are typically used in RL, where their step-wise scores are treated as raw rewards to maximize. To bridge this gap, we propose Verifiable Prefix Policy Optimization (VPPO), which uses PRMs only to localize the first error during RL. Given an incorrect rollout, VPPO partitions the trajectory into a verified correct prefix and an erroneous suffix based on the first error, rewarding the former while applying targeted penalties only after the detected mistake. This design yields stable, interpretable learning signals and improves credit assignment. Across multiple reasoning benchmarks, VPPO consistently outperforms sparse-reward RL and prior PRM-guided baselines on both Pass@1 and Pass@K.

Conclusion: 论文提出的统一理论框架和算法有效解决了有限内存下KV缓存优化的核心矛盾，显著提升了多LLM服务场景下的推理性能，为实际系统部署提供了理论基础和实践方案。

Abstract: KV caching is a fundamental technique for accelerating Large Language Model (LLM) inference by reusing key-value (KV) pairs from previous queries, but its effectiveness under limited memory is highly sensitive to the eviction policy. The default Least Recently Used (LRU) eviction algorithm struggles with dynamic online query arrivals, especially in multi-LLM serving scenarios, where balancing query load across workers and maximizing cache hit rate of each worker are inherently conflicting objectives. We give the first unified mathematical model that captures the core trade-offs between KV cache eviction and query routing. Our analysis reveals the theoretical limitations of existing methods and leads to principled algorithms that integrate provably competitive randomized KV cache eviction with learning-based methods to adaptively route queries with evolving patterns, thus balancing query load and cache hit rate. Our theoretical results are validated by extensive experiments across 4 benchmarks and 3 prefix-sharing settings, demonstrating improvements of up to 6.92$\times$ in cache hit rate, 11.96$\times$ reduction in latency, 14.06$\times$ reduction in time-to-first-token (TTFT), and 77.4% increase in throughput over the state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: We propose a novel approach to computationally efficient GP training based on the observation that square-exponential (SE) covariance matrices contain several off-diagonal entries extremely close to zero. We construct a principled procedure to eliminate those entries to produce a \emph{banded}-matrix approximation to the original covariance, whose inverse and determinant can be computed at a reduced computational cost, thus contributing to an efficient approximation to the likelihood function. We provide a theoretical analysis of the proposed method to preserve the structure of the original covariance in the 1D setting with SE kernel, and validate its computational efficiency against the variational free energy approach to sparse GPs.

Abstract: Forecasting rare events in multivariate time-series data is challenging due to severe class imbalance, long-range dependencies, and distributional uncertainty. We introduce EVEREST, a transformer-based architecture for probabilistic rare-event forecasting that delivers calibrated predictions and tail-aware risk estimation, with auxiliary interpretability via attention-based signal attribution. EVEREST integrates four components: (i) a learnable attention bottleneck for soft aggregation of temporal dynamics; (ii) an evidential head for estimating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty via a Normal--Inverse--Gamma distribution; (iii) an extreme-value head that models tail risk using a Generalized Pareto Distribution; and (iv) a lightweight precursor head for early-event detection. These modules are jointly optimized with a composite loss (focal loss, evidential NLL, and a tail-sensitive EVT penalty) and act only at training time; deployment uses a single classification head with no inference overhead (approximately 0.81M parameters). On a decade of space-weather data, EVEREST achieves state-of-the-art True Skill Statistic (TSS) of 0.973/0.970/0.966 at 24/48/72-hour horizons for C-class flares. The model is compact, efficient to train on commodity hardware, and applicable to high-stakes domains such as industrial monitoring, weather, and satellite diagnostics. Limitations include reliance on fixed-length inputs and exclusion of image-based modalities, motivating future extensions to streaming and multimodal forecasting.

TL;DR: 本文发现了一种出乎意料的现象：在使用微缩放数据格式进行模型量化时，当块大小降低到特定阈值以下时，量化模型的输出性能反而会下降，这与预期相悖。通过实验和理论研究，揭示了该异常现象源于窄张量分布与量化尺度有限动态范围之间的相互作用。基于这一洞察，作者提出使用FP8无符号E5M3格式作为FP4微缩放数据类型中尺度的新型硬件友好格式，可在无需全局缩放操作的情况下达到与常规FP8无符号E4M3尺度相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微缩放数据格式（Microscaling data formats）通过逐块张量量化实现激进的模型压缩，但其在训练和推理中的高效实现需要硬件友好的方案。虽然理论上更小的块大小应能更好地表示张量元素，实践中却观察到了性能下降的异常现象。为了提升量化效率并解决这一矛盾，作者旨在探究该现象背后的机理，并提出改进方案。

Method: 作者首先通过实验分析多个大语言模型的分布情况，识别导致异常行为的条件。理论方面，建立了一个与实验数据（包括预训练模型分布和理想分布）高度吻合的分析框架。基于量化误差来源的解耦分析，揭示了窄张量分布与量化尺度动态范围受限之间的相互作用是异常现象的主要驱动因素。最后，提出使用FP8无符号E5M3格式作为FP4微缩放数据类型中尺度的替代方案。

Result: 实验和理论分析证实，当块大小低于特定阈值时，量化模型的输出质量确实会下降。这一异常现象与量化误差的特定来源相关，且理论框架能准确预测实验观察结果。提出的FP8无符号E5M3格式在FP4微缩放数据类型中表现优异，与传统的FP8无符号E4M3尺度相比，在避免对权重和激活进行全局缩放操作的情况下，实现了可比的性能。

Conclusion: 微缩放量化中的性能异常现象源于窄张量分布与量化尺度有限动态范围之间的复杂相互作用。通过采用FP8无符号E5M3格式作为尺度表示，可以在保持硬件友好性的同时，有效缓解这一问题，为高效模型压缩和部署提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Microscaling data formats leverage per-block tensor quantization to enable aggressive model compression with limited loss in accuracy. Unlocking their potential for efficient training and inference necessitates hardware-friendly implementations that handle matrix multiplications in a native format and adopt efficient error-mitigation strategies. Herein, we report the emergence of a surprising behavior associated with microscaling quantization, whereas the output of a quantized model degrades as block size is decreased below a given threshold. This behavior clashes with the expectation that a smaller block size should allow for a better representation of the tensor elements. We investigate this phenomenon both experimentally and theoretically, decoupling the sources of quantization error behind it. Experimentally, we analyze the distributions of several Large Language Models and identify the conditions driving the anomalous behavior. Theoretically, we lay down a framework showing remarkable agreement with experimental data from pretrained model distributions and ideal ones. Overall, we show that the anomaly is driven by the interplay between narrow tensor distributions and the limited dynamic range of the quantized scales. Based on these insights, we propose the use of FP8 unsigned E5M3 (UE5M3) as a novel hardware-friendly format for the scales in FP4 microscaling data types. We demonstrate that UE5M3 achieves comparable performance to the conventional FP8 unsigned E4M3 scales while obviating the need of global scaling operations on weights and activations.

Abstract: Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is a fundamental task in reinforcement learning (RL). In the classic setting of linear OPE, finite-sample guarantees often take the form $$ \textrm{Evaluation error} \le \textrm{poly}(C^π, d, 1/n,\log(1/δ)), $$ where $d$ is the dimension of the features and $C^π$ is a coverage parameter that characterizes the degree to which the visited features lie in the span of the data distribution. While such guarantees are well-understood for several popular algorithms under stronger assumptions (e.g. Bellman completeness), the understanding is lacking and fragmented in the minimal setting where only the target value function is linearly realizable in the features. Despite recent interest in tight characterizations of the statistical rate in this setting, the right notion of coverage remains unclear, and candidate definitions from prior analyses have undesirable properties and are starkly disconnected from more standard definitions in the literature.
  We provide a novel finite-sample analysis of a canonical algorithm for this setting, LSTDQ. Inspired by an instrumental-variable view, we develop error bounds that depend on a novel coverage parameter, the feature-dynamics coverage, which can be interpreted as linear coverage in an induced dynamical system for feature evolution. With further assumptions -- such as Bellman-completeness -- our definition successfully recovers the coverage parameters specialized to those settings, finally yielding a unified understanding for coverage in linear OPE.

TL;DR: 本文分析了两种统计公平性度量（统计奇偶性和均等几率）之间的关系，重点研究基率不平衡如何导致这两种度量之间的不兼容性，并为实际应用中的权衡提供指导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数据驱动系统中，确保公平性和正义性是一个关键挑战。虽然统计奇偶性因不依赖真实标签而在法律和专业框架中被广泛采用，但均等几率在某些情境下对确保敏感社会群体间的错误预测奇偶性至关重要。本文旨在探讨这两种度量之间的关系及其在实际应用中的权衡问题。

Method: 本文提出了一种新颖的分析方法，研究统计奇偶性和均等几率之间的关系，重点关注敏感群体的基率不平衡如何影响这两种度量的兼容性。通过理论分析揭示基率失衡导致不兼容的机制。

Result: 分析表明，基率不平衡会导致统计奇偶性和均等几率之间的不兼容性。研究结果提供了关于如何在实践中在这两种度量之间进行权衡的见解，并建议在强制执行或依赖统计奇偶性标准前检查基率平衡性。

Conclusion: 研究指出，应在实际应用中更加关注基率平衡性的检查，并在强制执行统计公平性标准时考虑不同度量之间的可能不兼容性。这一见解可能促使改进现有实践和立法框架的举措。

Abstract: A key challenge in employing data, algorithms and data-driven systems is to adhere to the principle of fairness and justice. Statistical fairness measures belong to an important category of technical/formal mechanisms for detecting fairness issues in data and algorithms. In this contribution we study the relations between two types of statistical fairness measures namely Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds. The Statistical-Parity measure does not rely on having ground truth, i.e., (objectively) labeled target attributes. This makes Statistical-Parity a suitable measure in practice for assessing fairness in data and data classification algorithms. Therefore, Statistical-Parity is adopted in many legal and professional frameworks for assessing algorithmic fairness. The Equalized-Odds measure, on the contrary, relies on having (reliable) ground-truth, which is not always feasible in practice. Nevertheless, there are several situations where the Equalized-Odds definition should be satisfied to enforce false prediction parity among sensitive social groups. We present a novel analyze of the relation between Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds, depending on the base-rates of sensitive groups. The analysis intuitively shows how and when base-rate imbalance causes incompatibility between Statistical-Parity and Equalized-Odds measures. As such, our approach provides insight in (how to make design) trade-offs between these measures in practice. Further, based on our results, we plea for examining base-rate (im)balance and investigating the possibility of such an incompatibility before enforcing or relying on the Statistical-Parity criterion. The insights provided, we foresee, may trigger initiatives to improve or adjust the current practice and/or the existing legal frameworks.

Motivation: 现有时间序列数据增强方法主要依赖静态启发式范式，而动态数据优化研究表明不同训练阶段样本贡献度不同，因此需要针对训练阶段动态生成合成数据

Method: 提出OATS框架，利用有价值的训练样本作为指导信号，基于扩散模型动态生成高质量时间序列合成数据，并引入探索-利用机制平衡效率与效果

Result: 在六个验证数据集和两种时间序列基础模型架构上，OATS均显著优于常规训练和静态数据增强基线方法

Conclusion: OATS通过动态、有针对性的数据增强策略有效提升了时间序列基础模型的性能，为时间序列分析提供了新的数据增强范式

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) are a powerful paradigm for time series analysis and are often enhanced by synthetic data augmentation to improve the training data quality. Existing augmentation methods, however, typically rely on heuristics and static paradigms. Motivated by dynamic data optimization, which shows that the contribution of samples varies across training stages, we propose OATS (Online Data Augmentation for Time Series Foundation Models), a principled strategy that generates synthetic data tailored to different training steps. OATS leverages valuable training samples as principled guiding signals and dynamically generates high-quality synthetic data conditioned on them. We further design a diffusion-based framework to produce realistic time series and introduce an explore-exploit mechanism to balance efficiency and effectiveness. Experiments on TSFMs demonstrate that OATS consistently outperforms regular training and yields substantial performance gains over static data augmentation baselines across six validation datasets and two TSFM architectures.

Abstract: We study how to fine-tune LLMs using user-edit deployment data consisting of a set of context, an agent's response, and user edits. This deployment data is naturally generated by users in applications such as LLMs-based writing assistants and coding agents. The _natural_ origin of user edits makes it a desired source for adapting and personalizing LLMs. In this setup, there emerges a unification of various feedback types namely preferences, supervised labels, and cost that are typically studied separately in the literature. In this paper, we initiate the theoretical investigation of learning from user edits. We first derive bounds for learning algorithms that learn from each of these feedback types. We prove that these algorithms have different trade-offs depending upon the user, data distribution, and model class. We then propose a simple ensembling procedure to jointly learn from these feedback types. On two domains adapted from Gao et al. 2024, we show our ensembling procedure outperforms these methods that learn from individual feedback. Further, we show that our proposed procedure can robustly adapt to different user-edit distributions at test time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物神经系统需要在高速运行和能量受限之间取得平衡，演化出的解决方案是优先处理首个到达的信号。

Method: 1. 推理时，仅采用最先停止的模型进行预测，而非传统集成平均方法。

Result: 在Sudoku-Extreme难题上达到97.2%的准确率，比测试时间增强（TTA）方法少用10倍计算量；通过K=4并行训练且仅反向传播最低损失的获胜模型，单模型单次前向传播达到96.9%准确率。

Conclusion: 首次尖峰时间编码可以转化为训练成本，该资源受限的工作（仅用单张RTX 5090）还促成了改进版SwiGLU激活函数的发明，使Muon架构成为可能。

Abstract: Biological neural systems must be fast but are energy-constrained. Evolution's solution: act on the first signal. Winner-take-all circuits and time-to-first-spike coding implicitly treat when a neuron fires as an expression of confidence. We apply this principle to ensembles of Tiny Recursive Models (TRM). By basing the ensemble prediction solely on the first to halt rather than averaging predictions, we achieve 97.2% puzzle accuracy on Sudoku-Extreme while using 10x less compute than test-time augmentation (the baseline achieves 86.1% single-pass, 97.3% with TTA). Inference speed is an implicit indication of confidence. But can this capability be manifested as a training-only cost? Evidently yes: by maintaining K = 4 parallel latent states during training but backpropping only through the lowest-loss "winner," a single model achieves 96.9% +/- 0.6% puzzle accuracy with a single forward pass-matching TTA performance without any test-time augmentation. As in nature, this work was also resource constrained: all experimentation used a single RTX 5090. This necessitated efficiency and compelled our invention of a modified SwiGLU which made Muon viable. With Muon and K = 1 training, we exceed TRM baseline performance in 7k steps (40 min). Higher accuracy requires 36k steps: 1.5 hours for K = 1, 6 hours for K = 4.

TL;DR: EPAS方法通过渐进式激活共享训练，利用transformer深层激活冗余，提高训练和推理吞吐量，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对transformer深层存在冗余的QK或KV激活现象，设计既能减少计算又能保持模型性能的方法，解决大规模模型训练效率低下的问题。

Method: 提出EPAS方法：1) 渐进式增长共享区域：训练过程中逐渐将解码层切换到激活共享模式；2) 从深层向浅层扩展：利用深层冗余特性，分享区域从模型深层开始向浅层扩展；3) 支持可变共享区域：推理时可针对不同计算预算调整共享区域长度。

Result: 在125M到7B参数的LLaMA模型上实验：1) 训练吞吐量提升最高达11.1%；2) 推理吞吐量提升最高达29%；3) 在持续预训练中，将TinyLLaMA转为注意力共享模型，平均准确率比SOTA方法提升达10%。

Conclusion: EPAS方法有效利用了transformer的深层激活冗余，通过渐进式激活共享显著提升了训练和推理效率，在保持模型性能的同时证明了渐进式训练在跨层激活共享模型中的重要性。

Abstract: We present a novel method for Efficient training with Progressive Activation Sharing (EPAS). This method bridges progressive training paradigm with the phenomenon of redundant QK (or KV ) activations across deeper layers of transformers. EPAS gradually grows a sharing region during training by switching decoder layers to activation sharing mode. This results in throughput increase due to reduced compute. To utilize deeper layer redundancy, the sharing region starts from the deep end of the model and grows towards the shallow end. The EPAS trained models allow for variable region lengths of activation sharing for different compute budgets during inference. Empirical evaluations with QK activation sharing in LLaMA models ranging from 125M to 7B parameters show up to an 11.1% improvement in training throughput and up to a 29% improvement in inference throughput while maintaining similar loss curve to the baseline models. Furthermore, applying EPAS in continual pretraining to transform TinyLLaMA into an attention-sharing model yields up to a 10% improvement in average accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, emphasizing the significance of progressive training in cross layer activation sharing models.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个无数据、具有隐私保护的模型转换框架（隐私保护模型转录），用于将已训练的模型转换为具备隐私保障的版本，同时保持良好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前大量基于私有数据集训练的深度学习模型在实际应用中部署，但这些模型可能存在隐私泄露风险，攻击者可能从中恢复敏感数据或标签信息。因此需要一种无原始数据访问的隐私保护模型转换方案。

Method: 提出了一种协同竞争学习框架——差分隐私合成蒸馏，通过可训练生成器在无需原始数据的情况下，将预训练模型（教师）转换为隐私保护模型（学生）。该框架包含三个组件：1）生成器生成合成数据；2）教师和学生模型接收合成数据并通过灵活的数据/标签噪声扰动计算差分隐私标签；3）学生用噪声标签更新，生成器则通过对抗训练将学生作为判别器进行更新。

Result: 理论证明了该方法能保证差分隐私和收敛性。转录得到的学生模型具有良好的性能和隐私保护能力，同时生成器可产生适用于下游任务的隐私合成数据。大量实验表明该方法优于26个现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种有效的隐私保护模型转换解决方案，能在保证模型性能的同时实现隐私保护，并为下游任务生成可用的隐私合成数据。

Abstract: While many deep learning models trained on private datasets have been deployed in various practical tasks, they may pose a privacy leakage risk as attackers could recover informative data or label knowledge from models. In this work, we present \emph{privacy-preserving model transcription}, a data-free model-to-model conversion solution to facilitate model deployment with a privacy guarantee. To this end, we propose a cooperative-competitive learning approach termed \emph{differentially private synthetic distillation} that learns to convert a pretrained model (teacher) into its privacy-preserving counterpart (student) via a trainable generator without access to private data. The learning collaborates with three players in a unified framework and performs alternate optimization: i)~the generator is learned to generate synthetic data, ii)~the teacher and student accept the synthetic data and compute differential private labels by flexible data or label noisy perturbation, and iii)~the student is updated with noisy labels and the generator is updated by taking the student as a discriminator for adversarial training. We theoretically prove that our approach can guarantee differential privacy and convergence. The transcribed student has good performance and privacy protection, while the resulting generator can generate private synthetic data for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments clearly demonstrate that our approach outperforms 26 state-of-the-arts.

Motivation: 神经物理求解器在科学发现中的应用日益增长，但由于其在训练支持范围外的泛化能力不足，限制了新设计的探索和长时间预测。需要一种能够在分布变化下保持准确性的求解器来促进科学发现的探索。

Method: NOVA通过学习从初始稀疏场景集的物理对齐表示，建立了可泛化的神经物理求解器。该方法能够处理偏微分方程参数、几何和初始条件的分布变化。

Abstract: Neural physics solvers are increasingly used in scientific discovery, given their potential for rapid in silico insights into physical, materials, or biological systems and their long-time evolution. However, poor generalization beyond their training support limits exploration of novel designs and long-time horizon predictions. We introduce NOVA, a route to generalizable neural physics solvers that can provide rapid, accurate solutions to scenarios even under distributional shifts in partial differential equation parameters, geometries and initial conditions. By learning physics-aligned representations from an initial sparse set of scenarios, NOVA consistently achieves 1-2 orders of magnitude lower out-of-distribution errors than data-driven baselines across complex, nonlinear problems including heat transfer, diffusion-reaction and fluid flow. We further showcase NOVA's dual impact on stabilizing long-time dynamical rollouts and improving generative design through application to the simulation of nonlinear Turing systems and fluidic chip optimization. Unlike neural physics solvers that are constrained to retrieval and/or emulation within an a priori space, NOVA enables reliable extrapolation beyond known regimes, a key capability given the need for exploration of novel hypothesis spaces in scientific discovery

Conclusion: OWLEYE为可扩展和标签高效的异常检测建立了坚实基础，能够学习跨图的正常行为可转移模式。

Abstract: Graph data is informative to represent complex relationships such as transactions between accounts, communications between devices, and dependencies among machines or processes. Correspondingly, graph anomaly detection (GAD) plays a critical role in identifying anomalies across various domains, including finance, cybersecurity, manufacturing, etc. Facing the large-volume and multi-domain graph data, nascent efforts attempt to develop foundational generalist models capable of detecting anomalies in unseen graphs without retraining. To the best of our knowledge, the different feature semantics and dimensions of cross-domain graph data heavily hinder the development of the graph foundation model, leaving further in-depth continual learning and inference capabilities a quite open problem. Hence, we propose OWLEYE, a novel zero-shot GAD framework that learns transferable patterns of normal behavior from multiple graphs, with a threefold contribution. First, OWLEYE proposes a cross-domain feature alignment module to harmonize feature distributions, which preserves domain-specific semantics during alignment. Second, with aligned features, to enable continuous learning capabilities, OWLEYE designs the multi-domain multi-pattern dictionary learning to encode shared structural and attribute-based patterns. Third, for achieving the in-context learning ability, OWLEYE develops a truncated attention-based reconstruction module to robustly detect anomalies without requiring labeled data for unseen graph-structured data. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that OWLEYE achieves superior performance and generalizability compared to state-of-the-art baselines, establishing a strong foundation for scalable and label-efficient anomaly detection.

Motivation: 随着苹果芯片在机器学习开发中的使用增加，需要针对其统一内存架构优化推理工具。现有工具要么缺乏原生优化，要么只支持文本模型，无法满足多模态工作负载需求

Method: 基于MLX原生构建，为文本模型提供连续批处理，为多模态模型引入基于内容的图像前缀缓存技术

Result: 在文本模型上比llama.cpp吞吐量高21%-87%，支持16个并发请求时聚合吞吐量提升4.3倍；多模态重复图像查询速度提升28倍，延迟从21.7秒降至1秒以内

Conclusion: vllm-mlx框架有效提升了苹果硬件上的推理效率，支持文本和多模态模型，已开源供社区使用

Abstract: The growing adoption of Apple Silicon for machine learning development has created demand for efficient inference solutions that leverage its unique unified memory architecture. However, existing tools either lack native optimization (PyTorch MPS) or focus solely on text models (llama.cpp), leaving multimodal workloads underserved. We present vllm-mlx, a framework for efficient LLM and MLLM inference on Apple Silicon built natively on MLX. For text models, we achieve 21% to 87% higher throughput than llama.cpp across models ranging from Qwen3-0.6B to Nemotron-30B, while providing continuous batching that scales to 4.3x aggregate throughput at 16 concurrent requests. For multimodal models, we introduce content-based prefix caching that eliminates redundant vision encoding by identifying identical images through content hashing, regardless of input format. Our evaluation on Apple M4 Max demonstrates throughput of up to 525 tokens per second on text models and 28x speedup on repeated image queries, reducing multimodal latency from 21.7 seconds to under 1 second. Video analysis with up to 64 frames achieves 24.7x cache speedup. We release our implementation as open source to support efficient inference on consumer Apple hardware.

Motivation: 由于负边的存在违反了图同质性假设，常规图方法需要辅助结构来处理符号图。本文旨在直接通过高斯copula及其相关矩阵建模边间的潜在统计依赖，但简单的边-边关系建模在中等规模图上计算成本过高。

Method: 1) 将相关矩阵表示为边嵌入的Gramian矩阵，显著减少参数数量；2) 重新公式化条件概率分布，大幅降低推理成本。

Result: 理论验证了方法的线性收敛性，实验显示相比基线方法收敛速度显著更快，同时保持了与最先进模型相当的预测性能。

Conclusion: 该方法通过创新的参数化方式和概率分布重构，实现了符号图链路符号预测的高效可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Link sign prediction on a signed graph is a task to determine whether the relationship represented by an edge is positive or negative. Since the presence of negative edges violates the graph homophily assumption that adjacent nodes are similar, regular graph methods have not been applicable without auxiliary structures to handle them. We aim to directly model the latent statistical dependency among edges with the Gaussian copula and its corresponding correlation matrix, extending CopulaGNN. However, a naive modeling of edge-edge relations is computationally intractable even for a graph with moderate scale. To address this, we propose to 1) represent the correlation matrix as a Gramian of edge embeddings, significantly reducing the number of parameters, and 2) reformulate the conditional probability distribution to dramatically reduce the inference cost. We theoretically verify scalability of our method by proving its linear convergence. Also, our extensive experiments demonstrate that it achieves significantly faster convergence than baselines, maintaining competitive prediction performance to the state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Autoencoders have long been considered a nonlinear extension of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Prior studies have demonstrated that linear autoencoders (LAEs) can recover the ordered, axis-aligned principal components of PCA by incorporating non-uniform $\ell_2$ regularization or by adjusting the loss function. However, these approaches become insufficient in the nonlinear setting, as the remaining variance cannot be properly captured independently of the nonlinear mapping. In this work, we propose a novel autoencoder framework that integrates non-uniform variance regularization with an isometric constraint. This design serves as a natural generalization of PCA, enabling the model to preserve key advantages, such as ordered representations and variance retention, while remaining effective for nonlinear dimensionality reduction tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SEC文件中的风险披露通常只描述潜在不良事件而很少量化其发生概率，限制了概率分析的实用性，主要障碍是缺乏大规模、风险层面的监督数据来将披露的风险与已实现结果联系起来。

Method: 开发了一个全自动数据生成管道，将定性SEC风险披露转换为时间基准的监督数据，从Risk Factors部分生成公司特定、有时间限制的风险查询，并通过后续披露自动解析结果来标记。然后使用这些基于SEC文件的风险查询和结果数据集，训练一个紧凑的大型语言模型来估计披露风险在指定时间内发生的概率。

Result: 尽管模型规模适中，但在概率准确性和校准方面显著优于预训练和启发式基线模型，甚至超越了包括GPT-5在内的前沿通用模型。该方法展示了仅使用原始、按时间顺序、领域内文本的规模化全自动训练领域专家模型的可行性，而无需专有数据、外部语料库或手动标注。

Conclusion: 这项研究表明Foresight Learning为从自然产生的企业文件中学习校准的、与决策相关的信号提供了一条通用途径，所得模型可在单个GPU上部署，同时达到前沿性能水平。

Abstract: Risk disclosures in SEC filings describe potential adverse events but rarely quantify their likelihood, limiting their usefulness for probabilistic analysis. A central obstacle is the absence of large-scale, risk-level supervision linking disclosed risks to realized outcomes.
  We introduce a fully automated data generation pipeline that converts qualitative SEC risk disclosures into temporally grounded supervision using only public data. For each filing, the pipeline generates firm-specific, time-bounded risk queries from the Risk Factors section and labels them by automatically resolving outcomes against subsequent disclosures.
  Using this dataset of risk queries and outcomes grounded in SEC filings, we train a compact large language model to estimate the probability that a disclosed risk will materialize within a specified horizon. Despite its modest size, the resulting model substantially improves over pretrained and heuristic baselines, and outperforms frontier general-purpose models, including GPT-5, on probabilistic accuracy and calibration.
  More broadly, this work demonstrates that Foresight Learning enables scalable and fully automated training of domain-specific expert models using only raw, chronological, in-domain text -- without proprietary data, external corpora, or manual annotation. The resulting models achieve frontier-level performance while remaining deployable on a single GPU. This result suggests a general pathway for learning calibrated, decision-relevant signals from naturally occurring enterprise documents.
  To support transparency and reproducibility, we open-source the evaluation dataset used in this study.

Motivation: 现有的MWGraD算法在Wasserstein空间中的多目标优化收敛速度为O(1/t)，作者希望通过引入Nesterov加速技术来改进这一收敛速度，以处理概率分布空间中的多目标优化问题。

Method: 基于MWGraD算法框架，引入了Nesterov加速技术，提出了A-MWGraD算法。首先在连续时间动态下分析算法收敛性，然后提出了实际可用的核基离散化实现方案。

Result: 理论分析表明，A-MWGraD在测地凸目标下达到O(1/t^2)收敛率，在β强测地凸目标下达到O(e^{-√βt})收敛率，优于MWGraD的O(1/t)。数值实验验证了该算法在多目标采样任务中收敛速度和采样效率上的优越表现。

Conclusion: A-MWGraD算法成功地在Wasserstein空间多目标优化中将Nesterov加速技术，显著提升了收敛效率，为概率分布空间中的多目标优化问题提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study multi-objective optimization over probability distributions in Wasserstein space. Recently, Nguyen et al. (2025) introduced Multiple Wasserstein Gradient Descent (MWGraD) algorithm, which exploits the geometric structure of Wasserstein space to jointly optimize multiple objectives. Building on this approach, we propose an accelerated variant, A-MWGraD, inspired by Nesterov's acceleration. We analyze the continuous-time dynamics and establish convergence to weakly Pareto optimal points in probability space. Our theoretical results show that A-MWGraD achieves a convergence rate of O(1/t^2) for geodesically convex objectives and O(e^{-\sqrtβt}) for $β$-strongly geodesically convex objectives, improving upon the O(1/t) rate of MWGraD in the geodesically convex setting. We further introduce a practical kernel-based discretization for A-MWGraD and demonstrate through numerical experiments that it consistently outperforms MWGraD in convergence speed and sampling efficiency on multi-target sampling tasks.

Motivation: 现有RNA逆折叠方法主要关注序列恢复，难以处理二级结构一致性、最小自由能等结构目标，导致结构精度不足，影响治疗和合成生物学应用。

Method: 提出SOLD框架：1) 引入潜在扩散模型（LDM）建模序列-结构关系，集成RNA-FM预训练嵌入捕获协同进化模式；2) 结合强化学习优化非可微结构目标，通过策略驱动奖励优化，单步噪声优化避免全扩散轨迹采样。

Conclusion: SOLD通过强化学习与扩散模型结合，解决了RNA逆折叠中非可微结构目标的优化难题，在生物技术和治疗应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: RNA inverse folding, designing sequences to form specific 3D structures, is critical for therapeutics, gene regulation, and synthetic biology. Current methods, focused on sequence recovery, struggle to address structural objectives like secondary structure consistency (SS), minimum free energy (MFE), and local distance difference test (LDDT), leading to suboptimal structural accuracy. To tackle this, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework integrated with a latent diffusion model (LDM). Drawing inspiration from the success of diffusion models in RNA inverse folding, which adeptly model complex sequence-structure interactions, we develop an LDM incorporating pre-trained RNA-FM embeddings from a large-scale RNA model. These embeddings capture co-evolutionary patterns, markedly improving sequence recovery accuracy. However, existing approaches, including diffusion-based methods, cannot effectively handle non-differentiable structural objectives. By contrast, RL excels in this task by using policy-driven reward optimization to navigate complex, non-gradient-based objectives, offering a significant advantage over traditional methods. In summary, we propose the Step-wise Optimization of Latent Diffusion Model (SOLD), a novel RL framework that optimizes single-step noise without sampling the full diffusion trajectory, achieving efficient refinement of multiple structural objectives. Experimental results demonstrate SOLD surpasses its LDM baseline and state-of-the-art methods across all metrics, establishing a robust framework for RNA inverse folding with profound implications for biotechnological and therapeutic applications.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is critical for supply chain management to take proactive operations, but faces challenges: classical unsupervised anomaly detection based on exploiting data patterns often yields results misaligned with business requirements and domain knowledge, while manual expert analysis cannot scale to millions of products in the supply chain. We propose a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to systematically encode human expertise into interpretable, logic-based rules for detecting anomaly patterns in supply chain time series data. Our approach operates in three stages: 1) LLM-based labeling of training data instructed by domain knowledge, 2) automated generation and iterative improvements of symbolic rules through LLM-driven optimization, and 3) rule augmentation with business-relevant anomaly categories supported by LLMs to enhance interpretability. The experiment results showcase that our approach outperforms the unsupervised learning methods in both detection accuracy and interpretability. Furthermore, compared to direct LLM deployment for time series anomaly detection, our approach provides consistent, deterministic results with low computational latency and cost, making it ideal for production deployment. The proposed framework thus demonstrates how LLMs can bridge the gap between scalable automation and expert-driven decision-making in operational settings.

Abstract: Covariate-dependent uncertainty quantification in simulation-based inference is crucial for high-stakes decision-making but remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods such as conformal prediction and classical bootstrap, which struggle with covariate-specific conditioning. We propose Efficient Quantile-Regression-Based Generative Metamodeling (E-QRGMM), a novel framework that accelerates the quantile-regression-based generative metamodeling (QRGMM) approach by integrating cubic Hermite interpolation with gradient estimation. Theoretically, we show that E-QRGMM preserves the convergence rate of the original QRGMM while reducing grid complexity from $O(n^{1/2})$ to $O(n^{1/5})$ for the majority of quantile levels, thereby substantially improving computational efficiency. Empirically, E-QRGMM achieves a superior trade-off between distributional accuracy and training speed compared to both QRGMM and other advanced deep generative models on synthetic and practical datasets. Moreover, by enabling bootstrap-based construction of confidence intervals for arbitrary estimands of interest, E-QRGMM provides a practical solution for covariate-dependent uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Diffusion models achieve remarkable generation quality, yet face a fundamental challenge known as memorization, where generated samples can replicate training samples exactly. We develop a theoretical framework to explain this phenomenon by showing that the empirical score function (the score function corresponding to the empirical distribution) is a weighted sum of the score functions of Gaussian distributions, in which the weights are sharp softmax functions. This structure causes individual training samples to dominate the score function, resulting in sampling collapse. In practice, approximating the empirical score function with a neural network can partially alleviate this issue and improve generalization. Our theoretical framework explains why: In training, the neural network learns a smoother approximation of the weighted sum, allowing the sampling process to be influenced by local manifolds rather than single points. Leveraging this insight, we propose two novel methods to further enhance generalization: (1) Noise Unconditioning enables each training sample to adaptively determine its score function weight to increase the effect of more training samples, thereby preventing single-point dominance and mitigating collapse. (2) Temperature Smoothing introduces an explicit parameter to control the smoothness. By increasing the temperature in the softmax weights, we naturally reduce the dominance of any single training sample and mitigate memorization. Experiments across multiple datasets validate our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in improving generalization while maintaining high generation quality.

Abstract: Accurately predicting procurement lead time (PLT) remains a challenge in engineered-to-order industries such as shipbuilding and plant construction, where delays in a single key component can disrupt project timelines. In shipyards, pipe spools are critical components; installed deep within hull blocks soon after steel erection, any delay in their procurement can halt all downstream tasks. Recognizing their importance, existing studies predict PLT using the static physical attributes of pipe spools. However, procurement is inherently a dynamic, multi-stakeholder business process involving a continuous sequence of internal and external events at the shipyard, factors often overlooked in traditional approaches. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework that combines event logs, dataset records of the procurement events, with static attributes to predict PLT. The temporal attributes of each event are extracted to reflect the continuity and temporal context of the process. Subsequently, a deep sequential neural network combined with a multi-layered perceptron is employed to integrate these static and dynamic features, enabling the model to capture both structural and contextual information in procurement. Comparative experiments are conducted using real-world pipe spool procurement data from a globally renowned South Korean shipbuilding corporation. Three tasks are evaluated, which are production, post-processing, and procurement lead time prediction. The results show a 22.6% to 50.4% improvement in prediction performance in terms of mean absolute error over the best-performing existing approaches across the three tasks. These findings indicate the value of considering procurement process information for more accurate PLT prediction.

Abstract: We introduce contextual queueing bandits, a new context-aware framework for scheduling while simultaneously learning unknown service rates. Individual jobs carry heterogeneous contextual features, based on which the agent chooses a job and matches it with a server to maximize the departure rate. The service/departure rate is governed by a logistic model of the contextual feature with an unknown server-specific parameter. To evaluate the performance of a policy, we consider queue length regret, defined as the difference in queue length between the policy and the optimal policy. The main challenge in the analysis is that the lists of remaining job features in the queue may differ under our policy versus the optimal policy for a given time step, since they may process jobs in different orders. To address this, we propose the idea of policy-switching queues equipped with a sophisticated coupling argument. This leads to a novel queue length regret decomposition framework, allowing us to understand the short-term effect of choosing a suboptimal job-server pair and its long-term effect on queue state differences. We show that our algorithm, CQB-$\varepsilon$, achieves a regret upper bound of $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/4})$. We also consider the setting of adversarially chosen contexts, for which our second algorithm, CQB-Opt, achieves a regret upper bound of $\mathcal{O}(\log^2 T)$. Lastly, we provide experimental results that validate our theoretical findings.

Abstract: Machine learning models have demonstrated strong performance in classifying network traffic and identifying Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, enabling operators to discover and manage IoT assets at scale. However, many existing approaches rely on end-to-end supervised pipelines or task-specific fine-tuning, resulting in traffic representations that are tightly coupled to labeled datasets and deployment environments, which can limit generalizability. In this paper, we study the problem of learning generalizable traffic representations for IoT device identification. We design compact encoder architectures that learn per-flow embeddings from unlabeled IoT traffic and evaluate them using a frozen-encoder protocol with a simple supervised classifier. Our specific contributions are threefold. (1) We develop unsupervised encoder--decoder models that learn compact traffic representations from unlabeled IoT network flows and assess their quality through reconstruction-based analysis. (2) We show that these learned representations can be used effectively for IoT device-type classification using simple, lightweight classifiers trained on frozen embeddings. (3) We provide a systematic benchmarking study against the state-of-the-art pretrained traffic encoders, showing that larger models do not necessarily yield more robust representations for IoT traffic. Using more than 18 million real IoT traffic flows collected across multiple years and deployment environments, we learn traffic representations from unlabeled data and evaluate device-type classification on disjoint labeled subsets, achieving macro F1-scores exceeding 0.9 for device-type classification and demonstrating robustness under cross-environment deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化感知训练（QAT）对于在严格的内存和延迟约束下部署大模型至关重要，但在超低位宽下实现稳定且鲁棒的优化仍然具有挑战性。基于直通估计器（STE）或软量化器的常见方法往往存在梯度不匹配、不稳定性或高计算开销的问题。

Method: 提出了StableQAT框架，这是一个统一且高效的QAT框架。它通过一种新颖、轻量级且理论上有根据的替代方法（从舍入算子的离散傅里叶分析推导而来）来稳定超低位宽设置下的训练。该替代方法严格地将STE泛化为其更富表达力的替代函数族的一个特例，从而产生平滑、有界且计算成本低的梯度。

Result: 实验表明，StableQAT在2-4位量化范围内展现了稳定且高效的QAT，改善了训练稳定性、鲁棒性，并在训练开销几乎可忽略不计的情况下，性能优于标准的QAT技术。

Conclusion: StableQAT提供了一个稳定的QAT框架，能够有效应对超低位宽量化挑战，并在实际应用中展现出优异的训练稳定性、鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: Quantization-aware training (QAT) is essential for deploying large models under strict memory and latency constraints, yet achieving stable and robust optimization at ultra-low bitwidths remains challenging. Common approaches based on the straight-through estimator (STE) or soft quantizers often suffer from gradient mismatch, instability, or high computational overhead. As such, we propose StableQAT, a unified and efficient QAT framework that stabilizes training in ultra low-bit settings via a novel, lightweight, and theoretically grounded surrogate for backpropagation derived from a discrete Fourier analysis of the rounding operator. StableQAT strictly generalizes STE as the latter arises as a special case of our more expressive surrogate family, yielding smooth, bounded, and inexpensive gradients that improve QAT training performance and stability across various hyperparameter choices. In experiments, StableQAT exhibits stable and efficient QAT at 2-4 bit regimes, demonstrating improved training stability, robustness, and superior performance with negligible training overhead against standard QAT techniques.

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental primitive in unsupervised learning. However, classical algorithms for $k$-clustering (such as $k$-median and $k$-means) assume access to exact pairwise distances -- an unrealistic requirement in many modern applications. We study clustering in the \emph{Rank-model (R-model)}, where access to distances is entirely replaced by a \emph{quadruplet oracle} that provides only relative distance comparisons. In practice, such an oracle can represent learned models or human feedback, and is expected to be noisy and entail an access cost.
  Given a metric space with $n$ input items, we design randomized algorithms that, using only a noisy quadruplet oracle, compute a set of $O(k \cdot \mathsf{polylog}(n))$ centers along with a mapping from the input items to the centers such that the clustering cost of the mapping is at most constant times the optimum $k$-clustering cost. Our method achieves a query complexity of $O(n\cdot k \cdot \mathsf{polylog}(n))$ for arbitrary metric spaces and improves to $O((n+k^2) \cdot \mathsf{polylog}(n))$ when the underlying metric has bounded doubling dimension. When the metric has bounded doubling dimension we can further improve the approximation from constant to $1+\varepsilon$, for any arbitrarily small constant $\varepsilon\in(0,1)$, while preserving the same asymptotic query complexity. Our framework demonstrates how noisy, low-cost oracles, such as those derived from large language models, can be systematically integrated into scalable clustering algorithms.

Motivation: 从认知科学角度，人类通过将连续感官流分割为离散事件来进行决策。现有模型基强化学习方法在面对纹理、颜色等虚假变化时泛化能力有限，需要事件感知的表征来提升性能

Method: EAWM包含：1) 自动化事件生成器从原始观察中派生事件；2) 通用事件分割器（GES）识别事件边界；3) 通过事件预测塑造表征空间以捕获有意义的时空转换；4) 提出统一的世界模型架构形式化

Conclusion: EAWM通过事件感知表征收紧策略学习，无需手工标注，显著提升了模型基强化学习在结构相似场景中的泛化能力

Abstract: While model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) improves sample efficiency by learning world models from raw observations, existing methods struggle to generalize across structurally similar scenes and remain vulnerable to spurious variations such as textures or color shifts. From a cognitive science perspective, humans segment continuous sensory streams into discrete events and rely on these key events for decision-making. Motivated by this principle, we propose the Event-Aware World Model (EAWM), a general framework that learns event-aware representations to streamline policy learning without requiring handcrafted labels. EAWM employs an automated event generator to derive events from raw observations and introduces a Generic Event Segmentor (GES) to identify event boundaries, which mark the start and end time of event segments. Through event prediction, the representation space is shaped to capture meaningful spatio-temporal transitions. Beyond this, we present a unified formulation of seemingly distinct world model architectures and show the broad applicability of our methods. Experiments on Atari 100K, Craftax 1M, and DeepMind Control 500K, DMC-GB2 500K demonstrate that EAWM consistently boosts the performance of strong MBRL baselines by 10%-45%, setting new state-of-the-art results across benchmarks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Imbalanced node classification is a critical challenge in graph learning, where most existing methods typically utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to learn node representations. These methods can be broadly categorized into the data-level and the algorithm-level. The former aims to synthesize minority-class nodes to mitigate quantity imbalance, while the latter tries to optimize the learning process to highlight minority classes. However, neither of them addresses the inherently imbalanced graph structure, which is a fundamental factor that incurs majority-class dominance and minority-class assimilation in GNNs. Our theoretical analysis further supports this critical insight. Therefore, we propose GraphSB (Graph Structural Balance), a novel framework that incorporates Structural Balance as a key strategy to address the underlying imbalanced graph structure before node synthesis. Structural Balance performs a two-stage structure optimization: Structure Enhancement that mines hard samples near decision boundaries through dual-view analysis and enhances connectivity for minority classes through adaptive augmentation, and Relation Diffusion that propagates the enhanced minority context while simultaneously capturing higher-order structural dependencies. Thus, GraphSB balances structural distribution before node synthesis, enabling more effective learning in GNNs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphSB significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, the proposed Structural Balance can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art methods as a simple plug-and-play module, increasing their accuracy by an average of 4.57%.

TL;DR: Selective Steering：一种新的激活驱动方法，通过范数保持旋转和有选择的层应用，在保持模型能力的同时显著提升对抗攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管在模型对齐方面取得了进展，但大型语言模型仍然容易受到引发有害行为的对抗攻击。现有的激活驱动技术存在局限性：激活加法需要精心调整系数且对层特定范数变化敏感；方向消融只能提供二元控制；最近的Angular Steering存在范数不保持的问题，导致分布偏移和生成崩溃，特别是在小于70亿参数的模型中。

Method: 提出选择性驱动方法，包含两个关键创新：(1) 数学上严格的范数保持旋转公式，保持激活分布完整性；(2) 判别性层选择，仅在特征表示呈现相反符号类对齐的层应用驱动。

Result: 在九个模型上的实验表明，选择性驱动相比先前方法实现了5.5倍更高的攻击成功率，同时保持零困惑度违规，并在标准基准测试中保持约100%的能力保留率。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个原则性、高效的框架，用于可控且稳定的大型语言模型行为修改，解决了现有激活驱动方法的局限性。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in alignment, large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that elicit harmful behaviors. Activation steering techniques offer a promising inference-time intervention approach, but existing methods suffer from critical limitations: activation addition requires careful coefficient tuning and is sensitive to layer-specific norm variations, while directional ablation provides only binary control. Recent work on Angular Steering introduces continuous control via rotation in a 2D subspace, but its practical implementation violates norm preservation, causing distribution shift and generation collapse, particularly in models below 7B parameters. We propose Selective Steering, which addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a mathematically rigorous norm-preserving rotation formulation that maintains activation distribution integrity, and (2) discriminative layer selection that applies steering only where feature representations exhibit opposite-signed class alignment. Experiments across nine models demonstrate that Selective Steering achieves 5.5x higher attack success rates than prior methods while maintaining zero perplexity violations and approximately 100\% capability retention on standard benchmarks. Our approach provides a principled, efficient framework for controllable and stable LLM behavior modification. Code: https://github.com/knoveleng/steering

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) is a critical area that focuses on developing models capable of performing well on data from unseen distributions, which is essential for real-world applications. Existing approaches primarily concentrate on learning domain-invariant features, which assume that a model robust to variations in the source domains will generalize well to unseen target domains. However, these approaches neglect a deeper analysis at the parameter level, which makes the model hard to explicitly differentiate between parameters sensitive to domain shifts and those robust, potentially hindering its overall ability to generalize. In order to address these limitations, we first build a covariance-based parameter sensitivity analysis framework to quantify the sensitivity of each parameter in a model to domain shifts. By computing the covariance of parameter gradients across multiple source domains, we can identify parameters that are more susceptible to domain variations, which serves as our theoretical foundation. Based on this, we propose Domain-Sensitive Parameter Regularization (DSP-Reg), a principled framework that guides model optimization by a soft regularization technique that encourages the model to rely more on domain-invariant parameters while suppressing those that are domain-specific. This approach provides a more granular control over the model's learning process, leading to improved robustness and generalization to unseen domains. Extensive experiments on benchmarks, such as PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, and DomainNet, demonstrate that DSP-Reg outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving an average accuracy of 66.7\% and surpassing all baselines.

Abstract: Real-world Vehicle Routing Problems (RWVRPs) require solving complex, sequence-dependent challenges at scale with constraints such as delivery time window, replenishment or recharging stops, asymmetric travel cost, etc. While recent neural methods achieve strong results on large-scale classical VRP benchmarks, they struggle to address RWVRPs because their strategies overlook sequence dependencies and underutilize edge-level information, which are precisely the characteristics that define the complexity of RWVRPs. We present SEAFormer, a novel transformer that incorporates both node-level and edge-level information in decision-making through two key innovations. First, our Clustered Proximity Attention (CPA) exploits locality-aware clustering to reduce the complexity of attention from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ while preserving global perspective, allowing SEAFormer to efficiently train on large instances. Second, our lightweight edge-aware module captures pairwise features through residual fusion, enabling effective incorporation of edge-based information and faster convergence. Extensive experiments across four RWVRP variants with various scales demonstrate that SEAFormer achieves superior results over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, SEAFormer is the first neural method to solve 1,000+ node RWVRPs effectively, while also achieving superior performance on classic VRPs, making it a versatile solution for both research benchmarks and real-world applications.

Abstract: The automation of analog integrated circuit (IC) design remains a longstanding challenge, primarily due to the intricate interdependencies among physical layout, parasitic effects, and circuit-level performance. These interactions impose complex constraints that are difficult to accurately capture and optimize using conventional design methodologies. Although recent advances in machine learning (ML) have shown promise in automating specific stages of the analog design flow, the development of holistic, end-to-end frameworks that integrate these stages and iteratively refine layouts using post-layout, parasitic-aware performance feedback is still in its early stages. Furthermore, progress in this direction is hindered by the limited availability of open, high-quality datasets tailored to the analog domain, restricting both the benchmarking and the generalizability of ML-based techniques. To address these limitations, we present OSIRIS, a scalable dataset generation pipeline for analog IC design. OSIRIS systematically explores the design space of analog circuits while producing comprehensive performance metrics and metadata, thereby enabling ML-driven research in electronic design automation (EDA). In addition, we release a dataset consisting of 87,100 circuit variations generated with OSIRIS, accompanied by a reinforcement learning (RL)-based baseline method that exploits OSIRIS for analog design optimization.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are widely believed to excel at node representation learning through trainable neighborhood aggregations. We challenge this view by introducing Fixed Aggregation Features (FAFs), a training-free approach that transforms graph learning tasks into tabular problems. This simple shift enables the use of well-established tabular methods, offering strong interpretability and the flexibility to deploy diverse classifiers. Across 14 benchmarks, well-tuned multilayer perceptrons trained on FAFs rival or outperform state-of-the-art GNNs and graph transformers on 12 tasks -- often using only mean aggregation. The only exceptions are the Roman Empire and Minesweeper datasets, which typically require unusually deep GNNs. To explain the theoretical possibility of non-trainable aggregations, we connect our findings to Kolmogorov-Arnold representations and discuss when mean aggregation can be sufficient. In conclusion, our results call for (i) richer benchmarks benefiting from learning diverse neighborhood aggregations, (ii) strong tabular baselines as standard, and (iii) employing and advancing tabular models for graph data to gain new insights into related tasks.

Abstract: Incorporating demonstration data into reinforcement learning (RL) can greatly accelerate learning, but existing approaches often assume demonstrations are optimal and fully aligned with the target task. In practice, demonstrations are frequently sparse, suboptimal, or misaligned, which can degrade performance when these demonstrations are integrated into RL. We propose Adaptive Policy Composition (APC), a hierarchical model that adaptively composes multiple data-driven Normalizing Flow (NF) priors. Instead of enforcing strict adherence to the priors, APC estimates each prior's applicability to the target task while leveraging them for exploration. Moreover, APC either refines useful priors, or sidesteps misaligned ones when necessary to optimize downstream reward. Across diverse benchmarks, APC accelerates learning when demonstrations are aligned, remains robust under severe misalignment, and leverages suboptimal demonstrations to bootstrap exploration while avoiding performance degradation caused by overly strict adherence to suboptimal demonstrations.

TL;DR: LLM-VA通过正交向量的闭式对齐，使模型响应意愿与安全评估因果相关，消除越狱与过度拒绝的权衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有向量导向方法存在根本性权衡：减少越狱会增加过度拒绝，反之亦然。发现LLM将响应决策向量v_a和输入安全判断向量v_b编码为近乎正交方向，导致这两个过程被当作相互独立

Method: 提出LLM-VA，通过闭式权重更新对齐v_a与v_b，使模型响应意愿因果依赖于其安全评估。方法包括：1）使用SVM识别每层向量；2）选择安全相关层；3）通过最小范数权重修改迭代对齐向量；无需微调或架构改变

Result: 在12个LLM上实验表明，LLM-VA比最佳基线获得11.45%的F1提升，同时保留95.92%的实用性，能自动适应每个模型的安全偏置而无需手动调优

Conclusion: LLM-VA通过向量对齐有效解决了安全对齐LLM中越狱与过度拒绝的权衡问题，证明了响应决策和安全评估之间的因果依赖性是实现安全对齐的关键

Abstract: Safety-aligned LLMs suffer from two failure modes: jailbreak (answering harmful inputs) and over-refusal (declining benign queries). Existing vector steering methods adjust the magnitude of answer vectors, but this creates a fundamental trade-off -- reducing jailbreak increases over-refusal and vice versa. We identify the root cause: LLMs encode the decision to answer (answer vector $v_a$) and the judgment of input safety (benign vector $v_b$) as nearly orthogonal directions, treating them as independent processes. We propose LLM-VA, which aligns $v_a$ with $v_b$ through closed-form weight updates, making the model's willingness to answer causally dependent on its safety assessment -- without fine-tuning or architectural changes. Our method identifies vectors at each layer using SVMs, selects safety-relevant layers, and iteratively aligns vectors via minimum-norm weight modifications. Experiments on 12 LLMs demonstrate that LLM-VA achieves 11.45% higher F1 than the best baseline while preserving 95.92% utility, and automatically adapts to each model's safety bias without manual tuning.

Abstract: Real-world physical systems are inherently complex, often involving the coupling of multiple physics, making their simulation both highly valuable and challenging. Many mainstream approaches face challenges when dealing with decoupled data. Besides, they also suffer from low efficiency and fidelity in strongly coupled spatio-temporal physical systems. Here we propose GenCP, a novel and elegant generative paradigm for coupled multiphysics simulation. By formulating coupled-physics modeling as a probability modeling problem, our key innovation is to integrate probability density evolution in generative modeling with iterative multiphysics coupling, thereby enabling training on data from decoupled simulation and inferring coupled physics during sampling. We also utilize operator-splitting theory in the space of probability evolution to establish error controllability guarantees for this "conditional-to-joint" sampling scheme. We evaluate our paradigm on a synthetic setting and three challenging multi-physics scenarios to demonstrate both principled insight and superior application performance of GenCP. Code is available at this repo: github.com/AI4Science-WestlakeU/GenCP.

Motivation: 当前深度学习模型过度依赖深度而缺乏对中间表示有效性的结构保证，导致早期停止和自适应计算难以确定。作者旨在解决这一限制，为状态空间模型构建尺度一致的潜在动态结构。

Method: 提出FROST方法，通过分形归纳偏置强制实现自相似的表示流形结构，使迭代细化过程中保持尺度一致性。该方法建立在几何分析基础上，建立了迭代过程中的收缩和稳定收敛特性。

Result: 在ImageNet-100上的控制实验经验验证了预测的尺度一致行为，显示自适应效率从对齐的潜在几何结构中自然涌现。中间状态的停止自然产生基于特征的排序机制。

Conclusion: FROST方法通过分形结构偏置为状态空间模型提供了尺度一致的潜在表示，使得自适应计算变得定义良好，为深度模型的效率和可解释性提供了理论基础和实际验证。

Abstract: Recent deep learning models increasingly rely on depth without structural guarantees on the validity of intermediate representations, rendering early stopping and adaptive computation ill-posed. We address this limitation by formulating a structural requirement for state-space model's scale-consistent latent dynamics across iterative refinement, and derive Fractal of Stationary Transformations (FROST), which enforces a self-similar representation manifold through a fractal inductive bias. Under this geometry, intermediate states correspond to different resolutions of a shared representation, and we provide a geometric analysis establishing contraction and stable convergence across iterations. As a consequence of this scale-consistent structure, halting naturally admits a ranking-based formulation driven by intrinsic feature quality rather than extrinsic objectives. Controlled experiments on ImageNet-100 empirically verify the predicted scale-consistent behavior, showing that adaptive efficiency emerges from the aligned latent geometry.

Conclusion: AROMMA通过统一表示学习和标注对齐，有效解决了单分子和混合物气味表示的分裂问题，实现了跨领域的稳健泛化。

Abstract: Public olfaction datasets are small and fragmented across single molecules and mixtures, limiting learning of generalizable odor representations. Recent works either learn single-molecule embeddings or address mixtures via similarity or pairwise label prediction, leaving representations separate and unaligned. In this work, we propose AROMMA, a framework that learns a unified embedding space for single molecules and two-molecule mixtures. Each molecule is encoded by a chemical foundation model and the mixtures are composed by an attention-based aggregator, ensuring both permutation invariance and asymmetric molecular interactions. We further align odor descriptor sets using knowledge distillation and class-aware pseudo-labeling to enrich missing mixture annotations. AROMMA achieves state-of-the-art performance in both single-molecule and molecule-pair datasets, with up to 19.1% AUROC improvement, demonstrating a robust generalization in two domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在专业领域的无标注适应面临挑战，传统知识蒸馏方法容易陷入粗粒度模仿，学生模型不仅学习效率低，还可能继承教师模型推理缺陷。核心困境在于教师本身也非完美专家时，如何设计可靠的教学课程

Method: DGRC（分歧引导推理课程）方法：基于LLM在复杂推理可能出错但在原子子问题上可信度高的洞察，当学生与教师推理路径冲突时，分析分歧点生成原子查询并自答，创建高置信原子问答对。这些数据用于构建原子课程填补学生知识空白，同时作为筛选标准过滤教师原始推理链，形成经过验证的思维链课程

Result: 在医疗和法律领域的实验中，DGRC对不同规模的学生模型均表现出有效性。特别是在医疗领域，1.5B参数学生模型相比强无标注基线获得7.76%的相对提升

Conclusion: DGRC框架通过巧妙利用教师模型在子问题上的可靠性与整体推理能力的局限性之间的权衡，实现了高质量的无监督课程构建，有效提升了领域特定语言模型的适应性能

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized domains without human-annotated data is a crucial yet formidable challenge. Widely adopted knowledge distillation methods often devolve into coarse-grained mimicry, where the student model inefficiently targets its own weaknesses and risks inheriting the teacher's reasoning flaws. This exposes a critical pedagogical dilemma: how to devise a reliable curriculum when the teacher itself is not an infallible expert. Our work resolves this by capitalizing on a key insight: while LLMs may exhibit fallibility in complex, holistic reasoning, they often exhibit high fidelity on focused, atomic sub-problems. Based on this, we propose Divergence-Guided Reasoning Curriculum (DGRC), which constructs a learning path from atomic knowledge to reasoning chains by dynamically deriving two complementary curricula from disagreements in reasoning pathways. When a student and teacher produce conflicting results, DGRC directs the teacher to perform a diagnostic analysis: it analyzes both reasoning paths to formulate atomic queries that target the specific points of divergence, and then self-answers these queries to create high-confidence atomic question-answer pairs. These pairs then serve a dual purpose: (1) providing an atomic curriculum to rectify the student's knowledge gaps, and (2) serving as factual criteria to filter the teacher's original reasoning chains, yielding a verified CoT curriculum that teaches the student how to integrate atomic knowledge into complete reasoning paths. Experiments across the medical and legal domains on student models of various sizes demonstrate the effectiveness of our DGRC framework. Notably, our method achieves a 7.76% relative improvement for the 1.5B student model in the medical domain over strong unlabeled baseline.

Abstract: The deployment of Artificial Intelligence in high-risk domains, such as finance and healthcare, necessitates models that are both fair and transparent. While regulatory frameworks, including the EU's AI Act, mandate bias mitigation, they are deliberately vague about the definition of bias. In line with existing research, we argue that true fairness requires addressing bias at the intersections of protected groups. We propose a unified framework that leverages Mixed-Integer Optimization (MIO) to train intersectionally fair and intrinsically interpretable classifiers. We prove the equivalence of two measures of intersectional fairness (MSD and SPSF) in detecting the most unfair subgroup and empirically demonstrate that our MIO-based algorithm improves performance in finding bias. We train high-performing, interpretable classifiers that bound intersectional bias below an acceptable threshold, offering a robust solution for regulated industries and beyond.

Abstract: While InfoNCE powers modern contrastive learning, its geometric mechanisms remain under-characterized beyond the canonical alignment--uniformity decomposition. We present a measure-theoretic framework that models learning as the evolution of representation measures on a fixed embedding manifold. By establishing value and gradient consistency in the large-batch limit, we bridge the stochastic objective to explicit deterministic energy landscapes, uncovering a fundamental geometric bifurcation between the unimodal and multimodal regimes. In the unimodal setting, the intrinsic landscape is strictly convex with a unique Gibbs equilibrium; here, entropy acts merely as a tie-breaker, clarifying "uniformity" as a constrained expansion within the alignment basin. In contrast, the symmetric multimodal objective contains a persistent negative symmetric divergence term that remains even after kernel sharpening. We show that this term induces barrier-driven co-adaptation, enforcing a population-level modality gap as a structural geometric necessity rather than an initialization artifact. Our results shift the analytical lens from pointwise discrimination to population geometry, offering a principled basis for diagnosing and controlling distributional misalignment.

Motivation: 受Transformer中多头交互能增强注意力性能的启发，作者希望设计一种能显式建模跨头交互的注意力变体。

Method: 提出多头显式注意力(MEA)，包含：1）头级线性组合模块，对key和value向量进行跨头线性组合；2）头级分组归一化层，对齐重组后头的统计特性。

Result: MEA在预训练中表现出强鲁棒性，能使用更大学习率实现更快收敛，降低验证损失并提升任务性能。同时通过减少注意力头数量并利用HLC重构虚拟头，实现了KV缓存50%的压缩，在知识密集型任务上性能损失可忽略不计。

Conclusion: MEA是一种简单有效的注意力变体，通过显式建模头间交互实现了更好的训练稳定性和参数效率，同时提供了实用的KV缓存压缩方案。

Abstract: In large language models built upon the Transformer architecture, recent studies have shown that inter-head interaction can enhance attention performance. Motivated by this, we propose Multi-head Explicit Attention (MEA), a simple yet effective attention variant that explicitly models cross-head interaction. MEA consists of two key components: a Head-level Linear Composition (HLC) module that separately applies learnable linear combinations to the key and value vectors across heads, thereby enabling rich inter-head communication; and a head-level Group Normalization layer that aligns the statistical properties of the recombined heads. MEA shows strong robustness in pretraining, which allows the use of larger learning rates that lead to faster convergence, ultimately resulting in lower validation loss and improved performance across a range of tasks. Furthermore, we explore the parameter efficiency of MEA by reducing the number of attention heads and leveraging HLC to reconstruct them using low-rank "virtual heads". This enables a practical key-value cache compression strategy that reduces KV-cache memory usage by 50% with negligible performance loss on knowledge-intensive and scientific reasoning tasks, and only a 3.59% accuracy drop for Olympiad-level mathematical benchmarks.

Abstract: Safe exploration is a key requirement for reinforcement learning (RL) agents to learn and adapt online, beyond controlled (e.g. simulated) environments. In this work, we tackle this challenge by utilizing suboptimal yet conservative policies (e.g., obtained from offline data or simulators) as priors. Our approach, SOOPER, uses probabilistic dynamics models to optimistically explore, yet pessimistically fall back to the conservative policy prior if needed. We prove that SOOPER guarantees safety throughout learning, and establish convergence to an optimal policy by bounding its cumulative regret. Extensive experiments on key safe RL benchmarks and real-world hardware demonstrate that SOOPER is scalable, outperforms the state-of-the-art and validate our theoretical guarantees in practice.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) aim to solve diverse and complex problems through structured reasoning. Recent advances in group-based policy optimization methods have shown promise in enabling stable advantage estimation without reliance on process-level annotations. However, these methods rely on advantage gaps induced by high-quality samples within the same batch, which makes the training process fragile and inefficient when intra-group advantages collapse under challenging tasks. To address these problems, we propose a reinforcement learning mechanism named \emph{\textbf{R^3}} that along three directions: (1) a \emph{cross-context \underline{\textbf{R}}eplay} strategy that maintains the intra-group advantage by recalling valuable examples from historical trajectories of the same query, (2) an \emph{in-context self-\underline{\textbf{R}}eflection} mechanism enabling models to refine outputs by leveraging past failures, and (3) a \emph{structural entropy \underline{\textbf{R}}anking reward}, which assigns relative rewards to truncated or failed samples by ranking responses based on token-level entropy patterns, capturing both local exploration and global stability. We implement our method on Deepseek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and train it on the DeepscaleR-40k in the math domain. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves SoTA performance on several math benchmarks, representing significant improvements and fewer reasoning tokens over the base models. Code and model will be released.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training of Large Language Models (LLMs) across distributed data sources while preserving privacy. However, when federated LLMs are deployed in critical applications, it remains unclear which client(s) contributed to specific generated responses, hindering debugging, malicious client identification, fair reward allocation, and trust verification. We present ProToken, a novel Provenance methodology for Token-level attribution in federated LLMs that addresses client attribution during autoregressive text generation while maintaining FL privacy constraints. ProToken leverages two key insights to enable provenance at each token: (1) transformer architectures concentrate task-specific signals in later blocks, enabling strategic layer selection for computational tractability, and (2) gradient-based relevance weighting filters out irrelevant neural activations, focusing attribution on neurons that directly influence token generation. We evaluate ProToken across 16 configurations spanning four LLM architectures (Gemma, Llama, Qwen, SmolLM) and four domains (medical, financial, mathematical, coding). ProToken achieves 98% average attribution accuracy in correctly localizing responsible client(s), and maintains high accuracy when the number of clients are scaled, validating its practical viability for real-world deployment settings.

Abstract: Ambitious decarbonisation targets are catalysing growth in orders of new offshore wind farms. For these newly commissioned plants to run, accurate power forecasts are needed from the onset. These allow grid stability, good reserve management and efficient energy trading. Despite machine learning models having strong performances, they tend to require large volumes of site-specific data that new farms do not yet have. To overcome this data scarcity, we propose a novel transfer learning framework that clusters power output according to covariate meteorological features. Rather than training a single, general-purpose model, we thus forecast with an ensemble of expert models, each trained on a cluster. As these pre-trained models each specialise in a distinct weather pattern, they adapt efficiently to new sites and capture transferable, climate-dependent dynamics. Through the expert models' built-in calibration to seasonal and meteorological variability, we remove the industry-standard requirement of local measurements over a year. Our contributions are two-fold - we propose this novel framework and comprehensively evaluate it on eight offshore wind farms, achieving accurate cross-domain forecasting with under five months of site-specific data. Our experiments achieve a MAE of 3.52\%, providing empirical verification that reliable forecasts do not require a full annual cycle. Beyond power forecasting, this climate-aware transfer learning method opens new opportunities for offshore wind applications such as early-stage wind resource assessment, where reducing data requirements can significantly accelerate project development whilst effectively mitigating its inherent risks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前权重量化方法在3比特以下时精度损失严重，通常需要微调来保持性能，这增加了计算成本。因此需要一种无需微调的高效低比特量化方法。

Method: 提出LoPRo算法：1）对残差矩阵进行块级列置换和沃尔什-哈达玛变换，旋转重要性相似的列；2）显式保护最重要列块的量化精度；3）引入基于rank-1草图（R1SVD）的混合精度快速低秩分解来最小化量化成本。

Conclusion: LoPRo通过创新的残差矩阵变换和低秩分解技术，在不需微调的情况下实现了高效的2-3比特权重量化，在保持高推理效率的同时显著提升了量化精度。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) enables effective model compression while preserving relatively high accuracy. Current weight-only PTQ methods primarily focus on the challenging sub-3-bit regime, where approaches often suffer significant accuracy degradation, typically requiring fine-tuning to achieve competitive performance. In this work, we revisit the fundamental characteristics of weight quantization and analyze the challenges in quantizing the residual matrix under low-rank approximation. We propose LoPRo, a novel fine-tuning-free PTQ algorithm that enhances residual matrix quantization by applying block-wise permutation and Walsh-Hadamard transformations to rotate columns of similar importance, while explicitly preserving the quantization accuracy of the most salient column blocks. Furthermore, we introduce a mixed-precision fast low-rank decomposition based on rank-1 sketch (R1SVD) to further minimize quantization costs. Experiments demonstrate that LoPRo outperforms existing fine-tuning-free PTQ methods at both 2-bit and 3-bit quantization, achieving accuracy comparable to fine-tuning baselines. Specifically, LoPRo achieves state-of-the-art quantization accuracy on LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3 series models while delivering up to a 4$\times$ speedup. In the MoE model Mixtral-8x7B, LoPRo completes quantization within 2.5 hours, simultaneously reducing perplexity by 0.4$\downarrow$ and improving accuracy by 8\%$\uparrow$. Moreover, compared to other low-rank quantization methods, LoPRo achieves superior accuracy with a significantly lower rank, while maintaining high inference efficiency and minimal additional latency.

Abstract: Knowledge editing emerges as a crucial technique for efficiently correcting incorrect or outdated knowledge in large language models (LLM). Existing editing methods for unimodal LLM rely on a rigid parameter-to-output mapping, which causes causal-underfit and causal-overfit in cascaded reasoning for Multimodal LLM (MLLM). In this paper, we reformulate MLLM editing as an out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization problem, where the goal is to discern semantic shift with factual shift and thus achieve robust editing among diverse cross-modal prompting. The key challenge of this OOD problem lies in identifying invariant causal trajectories that generalize accurately while suppressing spurious correlations. To address it, we propose ODEdit, a plug-and-play invariant learning based framework that optimizes the tripartite OOD risk objective to simultaneously enhance editing reliability, locality, and generality.We further introduce an edit trajectory invariant learning method, which integrates a total variation penalty into the risk minimization objective to stabilize edit trajectories against environmental variations. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ODEdit.

Abstract: Unsupervised pre-training can equip reinforcement learning agents with prior knowledge and accelerate learning in downstream tasks. A promising direction, grounded in human development, investigates agents that learn by setting and pursuing their own goals. The core challenge lies in how to effectively generate, select, and learn from such goals. Our focus is on broad distributions of downstream tasks where solving every task zero-shot is infeasible. Such settings naturally arise when the target tasks lie outside of the pre-training distribution or when their identities are unknown to the agent. In this work, we (i) optimize for efficient multi-episode exploration and adaptation within a meta-learning framework, and (ii) guide the training curriculum with evolving estimates of the agent's post-adaptation performance. We present ULEE, an unsupervised meta-learning method that combines an in-context learner with an adversarial goal-generation strategy that maintains training at the frontier of the agent's capabilities. On XLand-MiniGrid benchmarks, ULEE pre-training yields improved exploration and adaptation abilities that generalize to novel objectives, environment dynamics, and map structures. The resulting policy attains improved zero-shot and few-shot performance, and provides a strong initialization for longer fine-tuning processes. It outperforms learning from scratch, DIAYN pre-training, and alternative curricula.

Abstract: We uncover that current objective-based Divisive Hierarchical Clustering (DHC) methods produce a dendrogram that does not have three desired properties i.e., no unwarranted splitting, group similar clusters into a same subset, ground-truth correspondence. This shortcoming has their root cause in using a set-oriented bisecting assessment criterion. We show that this shortcoming can be addressed by using a distributional kernel, instead of the set-oriented criterion; and the resultant clusters achieve a new distribution-oriented objective to maximize the total similarity of all clusters (TSC). Our theoretical analysis shows that the resultant dendrogram guarantees a lower bound of TSC. The empirical evaluation shows the effectiveness of our proposed method on artificial and Spatial Transcriptomics (bioinformatics) datasets. Our proposed method successfully creates a dendrogram that is consistent with the biological regions in a Spatial Transcriptomics dataset, whereas other contenders fail.

Abstract: Existing value-based online reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms suffer from slow policy exploitation due to ineffective exploration and delayed policy updates. To address these challenges, we propose an algorithm called Instant Retrospect Action (IRA). Specifically, we propose Q-Representation Discrepancy Evolution (RDE) to facilitate Q-network representation learning, enabling discriminative representations for neighboring state-action pairs. In addition, we adopt an explicit method to policy constraints by enabling Greedy Action Guidance (GAG). This is achieved through backtracking historical actions, which effectively enhances the policy update process. Our proposed method relies on providing the learning algorithm with accurate $k$-nearest-neighbor action value estimates and learning to design a fast-adaptable policy through policy constraints. We further propose the Instant Policy Update (IPU) mechanism, which enhances policy exploitation by systematically increasing the frequency of policy updates. We further discover that the early-stage training conservatism of the IRA method can alleviate the overestimation bias problem in value-based RL. Experimental results show that IRA can significantly improve the learning efficiency and final performance of online RL algorithms on eight MuJoCo continuous control tasks.

Abstract: The empirical evidence indicates that stochastic optimization with heavy-tailed gradient noise is more appropriate to characterize the training of machine learning models than that with standard bounded gradient variance noise. Most existing works on this phenomenon focus on the convergence of optimization errors, while the analysis for generalization bounds under the heavy-tailed gradient noise remains limited. In this paper, we develop a general framework for establishing generalization bounds under heavy-tailed noise. Specifically, we introduce a truncation argument to achieve the generalization error bound based on the algorithmic stability under the assumption of bounded $p$th centered moment with $p\in(1,2]$. Building on this framework, we further provide the stability and generalization analysis for several popular stochastic algorithms under heavy-tailed noise, including clipped and normalized stochastic gradient descent, as well as their mini-batch and momentum variants.

Abstract: Federated graph learning (FGL) has recently emerged as a promising privacy-preserving paradigm that enables distributed graph learning across multiple data owners. A critical privacy concern in federated learning is whether an adversary can recover raw data from shared gradients, a vulnerability known as deep leakage from gradients (DLG). However, most prior studies on the DLG problem focused on image or text data, and it remains an open question whether graphs can be effectively recovered, particularly when the graph structure and node features are uniquely entangled in GNNs. In this work, we first theoretically analyze the components in FGL and derive a crucial insight: once the graph structure is recovered, node features can be obtained through a closed-form recursive rule. Building on this analysis, we propose GraphDLG, a novel approach to recover raw training graphs from shared gradients in FGL, which can utilize randomly generated graphs or client-side training graphs as auxiliaries to enhance recovery. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphDLG outperforms existing solutions by successfully decoupling the graph structure and node features, achieving improvements of over 5.46% (by MSE) for node feature reconstruction and over 25.04% (by AUC) for graph structure reconstruction.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Continual learning is a challenge for models with static architecture, as they fail to adapt to when data distributions evolve across tasks. We introduce a mathematical framework that jointly models architecture and weights in a Sobolev space, enabling a rigorous investigation into the role of neural network architecture in continual learning and its effect on the forgetting loss. We derive necessary conditions for the continual learning solution and prove that learning only model weights is insufficient to mitigate catastrophic forgetting under distribution shifts. Consequently, we prove that by learning the architecture and weights simultaneously at each task, we can reduce catastrophic forgetting.
  To learn weights and architecture simultaneously, we formulate continual learning as a bilevel optimization problem: the upper level selects an optimal architecture for a given task, while the lower level computes optimal weights via dynamic programming over all tasks. To solve the upper level problem, we introduce a derivative-free direct search algorithm to determine the optimal architecture. Once found, we must transfer knowledge from the current architecture to the optimal one. However, the optimal architecture will result in a weights parameter space different from the current architecture (i.e., dimensions of weights matrices will not match). To bridge the dimensionality gap, we develop a low-rank transfer mechanism to map knowledge across architectures of mismatched dimensions. Empirical studies across regression and classification problems, including feedforward, convolutional, and graph neural networks, demonstrate that learning the optimal architecture and weights simultaneously yields substantially improved performance (up to two orders of magnitude), reduced forgetting, and enhanced robustness to noise compared with static architecture approaches.

Abstract: Federated Continual Learning (FCL) leverages inter-client collaboration to balance new knowledge acquisition and prior knowledge retention in non-stationary data. However, existing batch-based FCL methods lack adaptability to streaming scenarios featuring category overlap between old and new data and absent task identifiers, leading to indistinguishability of old and new knowledge, uncertain task assignments for samples, and knowledge confusion.To address this, we propose streaming federated continual learning setting: per federated learning (FL) round, clients process streaming data with disjoint samples and potentially overlapping categories without task identifiers, necessitating sustained inference capability for all prior categories after each FL round.Next, we introduce FedKACE: 1) an adaptive inference model switching mechanism that enables unidirectional switching from local model to global model to achieve a trade-off between personalization and generalization; 2) a adaptive gradient-balanced replay scheme that reconciles new knowledge learning and old knowledge retention under overlapping-class scenarios; 3) a kernel spectral boundary buffer maintenance that preserves high-information and high-boundary-influence samples to optimize cross-round knowledge retention. Experiments across multiple scenarios and regret analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of FedKACE.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of class-generalizable anomaly detection, where the objective is to develop a unified model by focusing our learning on the available normal data and a small amount of anomaly data in order to detect the completely unseen anomalies, also referred to as the out-of-distribution (OOD) classes. Adding to this challenge is the fact that the anomaly data is rare and costly to label. To achieve this, we propose a multidirectional meta-learning algorithm -- at the inner level, the model aims to learn the manifold of the normal data (representation); at the outer level, the model is meta-tuned with a few anomaly samples to maximize the softmax confidence margin between the normal and anomaly samples (decision surface calibration), treating normals as in-distribution (ID) and anomalies as out-of-distribution (OOD). By iteratively repeating this process over multiple episodes of predominantly normal and a small number of anomaly samples, we realize a multidirectional meta-learning framework. This two-level optimization, enhanced by multidirectional training, enables stronger generalization to unseen anomaly classes.

Conclusion: 无标签后处理框架可以有效结合模型的强预测能力与弱参考模型的校准优势，在数据稀缺的未来场景中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Villalobos et al. [2024] predict that publicly available human text will be exhausted within the next decade. Thus, improving models without access to ground-truth labels becomes increasingly important. We propose a label-free post-processing framework that improves a strong but miscalibrated model using a weaker yet better-calibrated reference. Our framework guarantees a strict performance improvement under any proper loss. Our approach is based on a characterization of when strict improvement is possible: when the strong and reference models are not mutually calibrated. We formalize this condition, connect it to arbitrage and no-trade results from economics, and develop an efficient Bregman projection algorithm that guarantees worst-case loss reduction without labels. Experiments on representative LLMs across varying scales demonstrate that our label-free method significantly reduces proper losses and calibration errors, achieving performance competitive with supervised baselines.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Continual learning, enabling models to acquire new skills and knowledge without degrading existing capabilities, remains a fundamental challenge for foundation models. While on-policy reinforcement learning can reduce forgetting, it requires explicit reward functions that are often unavailable. Learning from expert demonstrations, the primary alternative, is dominated by supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which is inherently off-policy. We introduce Self-Distillation Fine-Tuning (SDFT), a simple method that enables on-policy learning directly from demonstrations. SDFT leverages in-context learning by using a demonstration-conditioned model as its own teacher, generating on-policy training signals that preserve prior capabilities while acquiring new skills. Across skill learning and knowledge acquisition tasks, SDFT consistently outperforms SFT, achieving higher new-task accuracy while substantially reducing catastrophic forgetting. In sequential learning experiments, SDFT enables a single model to accumulate multiple skills over time without performance regression, establishing on-policy distillation as a practical path to continual learning from demonstrations.

Abstract: Since the early 90s, the evolution of the Business Process Management (BPM) discipline has been punctuated by successive waves of automation technologies. Some of these technologies enable the automation of individual tasks, while others focus on orchestrating the execution of end-to-end processes. The rise of Generative and Agentic Artificial Intelligence (AI) is opening the way for another such wave. However, this wave is poised to be different because it shifts the focus from automation to autonomy and from design-driven management of business processes to data-driven management, leveraging process mining techniques. This position paper, based on a keynote talk at the 2025 Workshop on AI for BPM, outlines how process mining has laid the foundations on top of which agents can sense process states, reason about improvement opportunities, and act to maintain and optimize performance. The paper proposes an architectural vision for Agentic Business Process Management Systems (A-BPMS): a new class of platforms that integrate autonomy, reasoning, and learning into process management and execution. The paper contends that such systems must support a continuum of processes, spanning from human-driven to fully autonomous, thus redefining the boundaries of process automation and governance.

Abstract: Benchmarking in continuous black-box optimisation is hindered by the limited structural diversity of existing test suites such as BBOB. We explore whether large language models embedded in an evolutionary loop can be used to design optimisation problems with clearly defined high-level landscape characteristics. Using the LLaMEA framework, we guide an LLM to generate problem code from natural-language descriptions of target properties, including multimodality, separability, basin-size homogeneity, search-space homogeneity and globallocal optima contrast. Inside the loop we score candidates through ELA-based property predictors. We introduce an ELA-space fitness-sharing mechanism that increases population diversity and steers the generator away from redundant landscapes. A complementary basin-of-attraction analysis, statistical testing and visual inspection, verifies that many of the generated functions indeed exhibit the intended structural traits. In addition, a t-SNE embedding shows that they expand the BBOB instance space rather than forming an unrelated cluster. The resulting library provides a broad, interpretable, and reproducible set of benchmark problems for landscape analysis and downstream tasks such as automated algorithm selection.

Abstract: Wastewater treatment plants consume 1-3% of global electricity, making accurate energy forecasting critical for operational optimization and sustainability. While machine learning models provide point predictions, they lack explainable uncertainty quantification essential for risk-aware decision-making in safety-critical infrastructure. This study develops an Interval Type-2 Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (IT2-ANFIS) that generates interpretable prediction intervals through fuzzy rule structures. Unlike black-box probabilistic methods, the proposed framework decomposes uncertainty across three levels: feature-level, footprint of uncertainty identify which variables introduce ambiguity, rule-level analysis reveals confidence in local models, and instance-level intervals quantify overall prediction uncertainty. Validated on Melbourne Water's Eastern Treatment Plant dataset, IT2-ANFIS achieves comparable predictive performance to first order ANFIS with substantially reduced variance across training runs, while providing explainable uncertainty estimates that link prediction confidence directly to operational conditions and input variables.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly relied upon for complex workflows, yet their ability to maintain flow of instructions remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks conflate task complexity with structural ordering, making it difficult to isolate the impact of prompt topology on performance. We introduce RIFT, Reordered Instruction Following Testbed, to assess instruction following by disentangling structure from content. Using rephrased Jeopardy! question-answer pairs, we test LLMs across two prompt structures: linear prompts, which progress sequentially, and jumping prompts, which preserve identical content but require non-sequential traversal. Across 10,000 evaluations spanning six state-of-the-art open-source LLMs, accuracy dropped by up to 72% under jumping conditions (compared to baseline), revealing a strong dependence on positional continuity. Error analysis shows that approximately 50% of failures stem from instruction-order violations and semantic drift, indicating that current architectures internalize instruction following as a sequential pattern rather than a reasoning skill. These results reveal structural sensitivity as a fundamental limitation in current architectures, with direct implications for applications requiring non-sequential control flow such as workflow automation and multi-agent systems.

Abstract: Theorem proving is fundamental to program verification, where the automated proof of Verification Conditions (VCs) remains a primary bottleneck. Real-world program verification frequently encounters hard VCs that existing Automated Theorem Provers (ATPs) cannot prove, leading to a critical need for extensive manual proofs that burden practical application. While Neural Theorem Proving (NTP) has achieved significant success in mathematical competitions, demonstrating the potential of machine learning approaches to formal reasoning, its application to program verification--particularly VC proving--remains largely unexplored. Despite existing work on annotation synthesis and verification-related theorem proving, no benchmark has specifically targeted this fundamental bottleneck: automated VC proving. This work introduces Neural Theorem Proving for Verification Conditions (NTP4VC), presenting the first real-world multi-language benchmark for this task. From real-world projects such as Linux and Contiki-OS kernel, our benchmark leverages industrial pipelines (Why3 and Frama-C) to generate semantically equivalent test cases across formal languages of Isabelle, Lean, and Rocq. We evaluate large language models (LLMs), both general-purpose and those fine-tuned for theorem proving, on NTP4VC. Results indicate that although LLMs show promise in VC proving, significant challenges remain for program verification, highlighting a large gap and opportunity for future research.

Abstract: As LLMs increasingly act as autonomous agents in interactive and multi-agent settings, understanding their strategic behavior is critical for safety, coordination, and AI-driven social and economic systems. We investigate how payoff magnitude and linguistic context shape LLM strategies in repeated social dilemmas, using a payoff-scaled Prisoner's Dilemma to isolate sensitivity to incentive strength. Across models and languages, we observe consistent behavioral patterns, including incentive-sensitive conditional strategies and cross-linguistic divergence. To interpret these dynamics, we train supervised classifiers on canonical repeated-game strategies and apply them to LLM decisions, revealing systematic, model- and language-dependent behavioral intentions, with linguistic framing sometimes matching or exceeding architectural effects. Our results provide a unified framework for auditing LLMs as strategic agents and highlight cooperation biases with direct implications for AI governance and multi-agent system design.

Abstract: Emotional Talking Face synthesis is pivotal in multimedia and signal processing, yet existing 3D methods suffer from two critical challenges: poor audio-vision emotion alignment, manifested as difficult audio emotion extraction and inadequate control over emotional micro-expressions; and a one-size-fits-all multi-view fusion strategy that overlooks uncertainty and feature quality differences, undermining rendering quality. We propose UA-3DTalk, Uncertainty-Aware 3D Emotional Talking Face Synthesis with emotion prior distillation, which has three core modules: the Prior Extraction module disentangles audio into content-synchronized features for alignment and person-specific complementary features for individualization; the Emotion Distillation module introduces a multi-modal attention-weighted fusion mechanism and 4D Gaussian encoding with multi-resolution code-books, enabling fine-grained audio emotion extraction and precise control of emotional micro-expressions; the Uncertainty-based Deformation deploys uncertainty blocks to estimate view-specific aleatoric (input noise) and epistemic (model parameters) uncertainty, realizing adaptive multi-view fusion and incorporating a multi-head decoder for Gaussian primitive optimization to mitigate the limitations of uniform-weight fusion. Extensive experiments on regular and emotional datasets show UA-3DTalk outperforms state-of-the-art methods like DEGSTalk and EDTalk by 5.2% in E-FID for emotion alignment, 3.1% in SyncC for lip synchronization, and 0.015 in LPIPS for rendering quality.

Abstract: Function call capabilities have become crucial for Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling them to interact more effectively with external tools and APIs. Existing methods for improving the function call capabilities of LLMs rely on data obtained either through manual annotation or automated generation by models, and use this data to finetune the LLMs. However, these methods often lack targeted design and are constrained by fixed patterns and data distributions, which limits their effectiveness in enhancing the generalization and robustness of function call LLMs. To address this limitation, we propose a novel adversarial data augmentation method that employs reinforcement learning to systematically identify and target the weaknesses of function call LLMs. Our training framework introduces a query model trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to generate adversarial queries that are specifically designed to challenge function call (FC) models. This approach adopts a zero sum game formulation, where the query model and the FC model engage in iterative alternating training. Overall, our method advances the development of more robust FC models and provides a systematic way to identify and correct weaknesses in the ability of LLMs to interact with external tools.

Abstract: Recent progress at the intersection of large language models (LLMs) and time series (TS) analysis has revealed both promise and fragility. While LLMs can reason over temporal structure given carefully engineered context, they often struggle with numeric fidelity, modality interference, and principled cross-modal integration. We present TS-Debate, a modality-specialized, collaborative multi-agent debate framework for zero-shot time series reasoning. TS-Debate assigns dedicated expert agents to textual context, visual patterns, and numerical signals, preceded by explicit domain knowledge elicitation, and coordinates their interaction via a structured debate protocol. Reviewer agents evaluate agent claims using a verification-conflict-calibration mechanism, supported by lightweight code execution and numerical lookup for programmatic verification. This architecture preserves modality fidelity, exposes conflicting evidence, and mitigates numeric hallucinations without task-specific fine-tuning. Across 20 tasks spanning three public benchmarks, TS-Debate achieves consistent and significant performance improvements over strong baselines, including standard multimodal debate in which all agents observe all inputs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Image geolocation aims to infer capture locations based on visual content. Fundamentally, this constitutes a reasoning process composed of \textit{hypothesis-verification cycles}, requiring models to possess both geospatial reasoning capabilities and the ability to verify evidence against geographic facts. Existing methods typically internalize location knowledge and reasoning patterns into static memory via supervised training or trajectory-based reinforcement fine-tuning. Consequently, these methods are prone to factual hallucinations and generalization bottlenecks in open-world settings or scenarios requiring dynamic knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose a Hierarchical Localization Agent, called LocationAgent. Our core philosophy is to retain hierarchical reasoning logic within the model while offloading the verification of geographic evidence to external tools. To implement hierarchical reasoning, we design the RER architecture (Reasoner-Executor-Recorder), which employs role separation and context compression to prevent the drifting problem in multi-step reasoning. For evidence verification, we construct a suite of clue exploration tools that provide diverse evidence to support location reasoning. Furthermore, to address data leakage and the scarcity of Chinese data in existing datasets, we introduce CCL-Bench (China City Location Bench), an image geolocation benchmark encompassing various scene granularities and difficulty levels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LocationAgent significantly outperforms existing methods by at least 30\% in zero-shot settings.

TL;DR: ProceduralGraph：一个用于从自然语言提取工作流程序图的多智能体框架，通过结构化和逻辑反馈迭代优化结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从自然语言自动提取工作流程序图具有应用前景但探索不足，需要同时保证结构有效性和逻辑一致性。现有LLM方法常产生结构错误或逻辑误解。

Method: 提出多智能体框架，将程序图提取建模为多轮推理过程，包含三个阶段：1) 图提取（构建智能体），2) 结构化反馈（模拟智能体诊断结构缺陷），3) 逻辑反馈（语义智能体对齐流程逻辑与文本语义）。重要反馈用自然语言表达并注入后续提示。

Result: 实验表明该方法在结构正确性和逻辑一致性上均显著优于强基线。

Conclusion: ProceduralGraph框架通过模块化设计和迭代优化，有效解决了程序图提取中结构和逻辑对齐问题，无需监督或参数更新。

Abstract: Automatically extracting workflows as procedural graphs from natural language is promising yet underexplored, demanding both structural validity and logical alignment. While recent large language models (LLMs) show potential for procedural graph extraction, they often produce ill-formed structures or misinterpret logical flows. We present \model{}, a multi-agent framework that formulates procedural graph extraction as a multi-round reasoning process with dedicated structural and logical refinement. The framework iterates through three stages: (1) a graph extraction phase with the graph builder agent, (2) a structural feedback phase in which a simulation agent diagnoses and explains structural defects, and (3) a logical feedback phase in which a semantic agent aligns semantics between flow logic and linguistic cues in the source text. Important feedback is prioritized and expressed in natural language, which is injected into subsequent prompts, enabling interpretable and controllable refinement. This modular design allows agents to target distinct error types without supervision or parameter updates. Experiments demonstrate that \model{} achieves substantial improvements in both structural correctness and logical consistency over strong baselines.

TL;DR: 本文提出CollectiveKV，一种跨用户的KV共享机制，通过可学习的全局KV池捕获用户间的共享信息，显著压缩KV缓存至原始大小的0.8%，同时保持或提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 序列推荐系统中的Transformer模型受限于其KV缓存的高存储开销，特别是对于用户基数大、历史序列长的情况。研究发现不同用户的KV序列存在显著相似性，表明KV中存在协作信号，且大多数信息是跨用户可共享的。

Method: 提出CollectiveKV，通过可学习的全局KV池捕获跨用户的共享信息。在推理时，每个用户从池中检索高维共享KV，并与低维用户特定KV拼接，得到最终的KV表示。

Result: 在五个序列推荐模型和三个数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够将KV缓存压缩至原始大小的0.8%，同时保持甚至提升模型性能。

Conclusion: CollectiveKV通过有效利用KV序列中的协作信号，解决了序列推荐中KV缓存的高存储开销问题，为大规模序列推荐系统的低延迟部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Sequential recommendation models are widely used in applications, yet they face stringent latency requirements. Mainstream models leverage the Transformer attention mechanism to improve performance, but its computational complexity grows with the sequence length, leading to a latency challenge for long sequences. Consequently, KV cache technology has recently been explored in sequential recommendation systems to reduce inference latency. However, KV cache introduces substantial storage overhead in sequential recommendation systems, which often have a large user base with potentially very long user history sequences. In this work, we observe that KV sequences across different users exhibit significant similarities, indicating the existence of collaborative signals in KV. Furthermore, we analyze the KV using singular value decomposition (SVD) and find that the information in KV can be divided into two parts: the majority of the information is shareable across users, while a small portion is user-specific. Motivated by this, we propose CollectiveKV, a cross-user KV sharing mechanism. It captures the information shared across users through a learnable global KV pool. During inference, each user retrieves high-dimensional shared KV from the pool and concatenates them with low-dimensional user-specific KV to obtain the final KV. Experiments on five sequential recommendation models and three datasets show that our method can compress the KV cache to only 0.8% of its original size, while maintaining or even enhancing model performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表格理解数据集仅提供简短答案，缺乏明确的多步推理监督，导致模型回答准确率低、可解释性差

Method: 开发CoReTab框架生成代码耦合推理，构建115K验证样本数据集，通过三阶段流程训练多模态大语言模型

Result: 在17个基准测试中，CoReTab训练模型相比基线在表格QA、事实验证和结构理解上分别提升6.2%、5.7%和25.6%

Conclusion: CoReTab为改进多模态表格理解中的多步骤推理提供了一个稳健且可泛化的监督框架

Abstract: Existing datasets for multimodal table understanding, such as MMTab, primarily provide short factual answers without explicit multi-step reasoning supervision. Models trained on these datasets often generate brief responses that offers insufficient accuracy and limited interpretability into how these models arrive at the final answer. We introduce CoReTab, a code-driven reasoning framework that produces scalable, interpretable, and automatically verifiable annotations by coupling multi-step reasoning with executable Python code. Using the CoReTab framework, we curate a dataset of 115K verified samples averaging 529 tokens per response and fine-tune open-source MLLMs through a three-stage pipeline. We evaluate the resulting model trained on CoReTab across 17 MMTab benchmarks spanning table question answering, fact verification, and table structure understanding. Our model achieves significant gains of +6.2%, +5.7%, and +25.6%, respectively, over MMTab-trained baselines, while producing transparent and verifiable reasoning traces. These results establish CoReTab as a robust and generalizable supervision framework for improving multi-step reasoning in multimodal table understanding.

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents powered by large foundation models enable autonomous task execution, but frequent updates altering UI appearance and reorganizing workflows cause agents trained on historical data to fail. Despite surface changes, functional semantics and task intents remain fundamentally stable. Building on this insight, we introduce MAGNET, a memory-driven adaptive agent framework with dual-level memory: stationary memory linking diverse visual features to stable functional semantics for robust action grounding and procedural memory capturing stable task intents across varying workflows. We propose a dynamic memory evolution mechanism that continuously refines both memories by prioritizing frequently accessed knowledge. Online benchmark AndroidWorld evaluations show substantial improvements over baselines, while offline benchmarks confirm consistent gains under distribution shifts. These results validate that leveraging stable structures across interface changes improves agent performance and generalization in evolving software environments.

Abstract: Recent vision-language models have strong perceptual ability but their implicit reasoning is hard to explain and easily generates hallucinations on complex queries. Compositional methods improve interpretability, but most rely on a single agent or hand-crafted pipeline and cannot decide when to collaborate across complementary agents or compete among overlapping ones. We introduce MATA (Multi-Agent hierarchical Trainable Automaton), a multi-agent system presented as a hierarchical finite-state automaton for visual reasoning whose top-level transitions are chosen by a trainable hyper agent. Each agent corresponds to a state in the hyper automaton, and runs a small rule-based sub-automaton for reliable micro-control. All agents read and write a shared memory, yielding transparent execution history. To supervise the hyper agent's transition policy, we build transition-trajectory trees and transform to memory-to-next-state pairs, forming the MATA-SFT-90K dataset for supervised finetuning (SFT). The finetuned LLM as the transition policy understands the query and the capacity of agents, and it can efficiently choose the optimal agent to solve the task. Across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks, MATA achieves the state-of-the-art results compared with monolithic and compositional baselines. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/ControlNet/MATA.

Motivation: 现有的幻觉检测方法在同领域表现良好，但在跨领域时泛化能力差。本文研究通用幻觉检测问题，旨在使用单一领域数据训练检测器，同时在相关领域中保持鲁棒性能。

Method: 研究多轮对话后观察到，幻觉引发的对话比事实性对话表现出更大的不确定性波动。基于此现象提出SpikeScore，量化多轮对话中的突发波动幅度，通过理论分析和实证验证其在跨域分离幻觉和非幻觉回答的有效性。

Conclusion: SpikeScore通过检测多轮对话中的不确定性波动，为幻觉检测提供了有效的跨领域泛化解决方案，能够更准确地识别不同领域中的幻觉回答。

Abstract: Hallucination detection is critical for deploying large language models (LLMs) in real-world applications. Existing hallucination detection methods achieve strong performance when the training and test data come from the same domain, but they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization. In this paper, we study an important yet overlooked problem, termed generalizable hallucination detection (GHD), which aims to train hallucination detectors on data from a single domain while ensuring robust performance across diverse related domains. In studying GHD, we simulate multi-turn dialogues following LLMs initial response and observe an interesting phenomenon: hallucination-initiated multi-turn dialogues universally exhibit larger uncertainty fluctuations than factual ones across different domains. Based on the phenomenon, we propose a new score SpikeScore, which quantifies abrupt fluctuations in multi-turn dialogues. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that SpikeScore achieves strong cross-domain separability between hallucinated and non-hallucinated responses. Experiments across multiple LLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that the SpikeScore-based detection method outperforms representative baselines in cross-domain generalization and surpasses advanced generalization-oriented methods, verifying the effectiveness of our method in cross-domain hallucination detection.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了GLOVE框架，通过在LLM记忆系统中建立相对真实概念来解决动态漂移环境中的记忆有效性问题，通过主动探测不一致性实现无监督记忆更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆增强LLM方法通常假设记忆有效性可以通过外部评估器或模型内省来建立，但这一假设在动态漂移的实际环境中往往失效。需要一种能够适应环境变化、不依赖外部监督或强模型反思的记忆验证机制。

Method: 提出GLOVE框架，通过主动探测检索的记忆与新鲜观察之间的不一致性，建立相对真实概念并实现记忆-环境重新对齐。该系统无须访问真实监督或强依赖模型内省即可验证和更新记忆。

Result: 在Web导航、规划和控制的多样化基准测试（增加了受控环境漂移）中进行评估。结果表明，GLOVE显著提高了智能体成功率。

Conclusion: GLOVE为构建能够自我演化的认知智能体提供了一条稳健路径，通过相对真实检测和主动不一致性探测，解决了动态环境中记忆保持有效性的挑战。

Abstract: Most existing memory-enhanced Large Language Model (LLM) approaches implicitly assume that memory validity can be established either through external evaluators that provide task-specific success signals or through internal model cognition, such as reflection, for editing memory entries. However, these assumptions often break down in practical environments with dynamic drifts. We propose the Global Verifier (GLOVE), a framework that introduces a new design dimension for LLM memory systems by establishing a relative notion of truth. Through active probing to detect inconsistencies between retrieved memories and fresh observations, GLOVE enables memory-environment realignment by verifying and updating memory without access to ground-truth supervision or strong reliance on model introspection. We evaluate GLOVE on diverse benchmarks spanning web navigation, planning, and control, augmented with controlled environmental drifts that introduce non-stationarity beyond the original benchmark settings. Our results show that GLOVE substantially improves agent success rates, suggesting a robust pathway to cognitive agents capable of self-evolving.

Abstract: As large language models become integral to agentic artificial intelligence systems, their energy demands during inference may pose significant sustainability challenges. This study investigates whether deploying smaller-scale language models can reduce energy consumption without compromising responsiveness and output quality in a multi-agent, real-world environments. We conduct a comparative analysis across language models of varying scales to quantify trade-offs between efficiency and performance. Results show that smaller open-weights models can lower energy usage while preserving task quality. Building on these findings, we propose practical guidelines for sustainable artificial intelligence design, including optimal batch size configuration and computation resource allocation. These insights offer actionable strategies for developing scalable, environmentally responsible artificial intelligence systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Production LLM deployments serve diverse workloads where cost and quality requirements vary by customer tier, time of day, and query criticality. Model serving systems accept latency SLOs directly. LLM routers do not. They force operators to tune parameters offline and guess what accuracy might result. The relationship between parameters and outcomes is indirect, non-monotonic, and dataset-dependent. Operators need to specify accuracy targets, not infer them from opaque settings. We present PROTEUS (Polymorphic Router for Operational Target Enforcement with Unified SLA), a router that accepts accuracy targets tau as runtime input. PROTEUS uses Lagrangian dual control. A learned dual variable lambda tracks constraint violations during training and conditions the policy network. This lets the router translate specified tau values into routing decisions that satisfy them. A single trained model serves the full accuracy spectrum without retraining.We evaluate on RouterBench (11 models, 405K queries) and SPROUT (14 models, 45K queries). PROTEUS achieves consistent floor compliance where accuracy meets or exceeds tau. The target-response correlation reaches 0.97 to 0.98. The closest baseline, OmniRouter, meets floors only 22% of the time despite also using Lagrangian optimization. PROTEUS operates across tau in [0.85, 0.95] from a single model. On RouterBench it achieves 90.1% accuracy, within 1.3% of oracle. On SPROUT it achieves 94.0% accuracy, within 4.6% of oracle. Cost savings reach 89.8% versus the best fixed model.

Abstract: Within the domain of large language models, reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms necessitate the generation of a complete reasoning trajectory beginning from the input query, which incurs significant computational overhead during the rollout phase of training. To address this issue, we analyze the impact of different segments of the reasoning path on the correctness of the final result and, based on these insights, propose Reinforcement Fine-Tuning with Partial Reasoning Optimization (RPO), a plug-and-play reinforcement fine-tuning algorithm. Unlike traditional reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms that generate full reasoning paths, RPO trains the model by generating suffixes of the reasoning path using experience cache. During the rollout phase of training, RPO reduces token generation in this phase by approximately 95%, greatly lowering the theoretical time overhead. Compared with full-path reinforcement fine-tuning algorithms, RPO reduces the training time of the 1.5B model by 90% and the 7B model by 72%. At the same time, it can be integrated with typical algorithms such as GRPO and DAPO, enabling them to achieve training acceleration while maintaining performance comparable to the original algorithms. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/yhz5613813/RPO.

Motivation: 酸性水净化对于减少排放、降低腐蚀风险、实现水回用和降低运营成本至关重要。传统处理方法存在环境风险和设备腐蚀问题，自动化净化过程能减少工人接触风险。目前需要一种简单直观的控制系统，让非专业人员也能有效操作。

Abstract: Purifying sour water is essential for reducing emissions, minimizing corrosion risks, enabling the reuse of treated water in industrial or domestic applications, and ultimately lowering operational costs. Moreover, automating the purification process helps reduce the risk of worker harm by limiting human involvement. Crude oil contains acidic components such as hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, and other chemical compounds. During processing, these substances are partially released into sour water. If not properly treated, sour water poses serious environmental threats and accelerates the corrosion of pipelines and equipment. This paper presents a fuzzy expert system, combined with a custom-generated digital twin, developed from a documented industrial process to maintain key parameters at desired levels by mimicking human reasoning. The control strategy is designed to be simple and intuitive, allowing junior or non-expert personnel to interact with the system effectively. The digital twin was developed using Honeywell UniSim Design R492 to simulate real industrial behavior accurately. Valve dynamics were modeled through system identification in MATLAB, and real-time data exchange between the simulator and controller was established using OPC DA. The fuzzy controller applies split-range control to two valves and was tested under 21 different initial pressure conditions using five distinct defuzzification strategies, resulting in a total of 105 unique test scenarios. System performance was evaluated using both error-based metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, IAE, ISE, ITAE) and dynamic response metrics, including overshoot, undershoot, rise time, fall time, settling time, and steady-state error. A web-based simulation interface was developed in Python using the Streamlit framework. Although demonstrated here for sour water treatment, the proposed fuzzy expert system is general-purpose.

Abstract: Benchmarks are important tools to track progress in the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet inaccuracies in datasets and evaluation methods consistently undermine their effectiveness. Here, we present Omni-MATH-2, a manually revised version of the Omni-MATH dataset comprising a clean, exact-answer subset ($n{=}4181$) and a tagged, non-standard subset ($n{=}247$). Each problem was audited to ensure LaTeX compilability, solvability and verifiability, which involved adding missing figures or information, labeling problems requiring a proof, estimation or image, and removing clutter. This process significantly reduces dataset-induced noise, thereby providing a more precise assessment of model performance. The annotated dataset also allows us to evaluate judge-induced noise by comparing GPT-5 mini with the original Omni-Judge, revealing substantial discrepancies between judges on both the clean and tagged problem subsets. Expert annotations reveal that Omni-Judge is wrong in $96.4\%$ of the judge disagreements, indicating its inability to differentiate between models' abilities, even well before saturation of the benchmark occurs. As problems become more challenging, we find that increasingly competent judges become essential in order to prevent judge errors from masking genuine differences between models. Finally, neither judge identifies the present failure modes for the subset of tagged problems, demonstrating that dataset quality and judge reliability are both critical to develop accurate benchmarks of model performance.

Abstract: Code localization constitutes a key bottleneck in automated software development pipelines. While concurrent tool execution can enhance discovery speed, current agents demonstrate a 34.9\% redundant invocation rate, which negates parallelism benefits. We propose \textbf{FuseSearch}, reformulating parallel code localization as a \textbf{joint quality-efficiency optimization} task. Through defining \textbf{tool efficiency} -- the ratio of unique information gain to invocation count -- we utilize a two-phase SFT and RL training approach for learning adaptive parallel strategies. Different from fixed-breadth approaches, FuseSearch dynamically modulates search breadth according to task context, evolving from exploration phases to refinement stages. Evaluated on SWE-bench Verified, FuseSearch-4B achieves SOTA-level performance (84.7\% file-level and 56.4\% function-level $F_1$ scores) with 93.6\% speedup, utilizing 67.7\% fewer turns and 68.9\% fewer tokens. Results indicate that efficiency-aware training naturally improves quality through eliminating noisy redundant signals, enabling high-performance cost-effective localization agents.

Abstract: Heuristic functions are essential to the performance of tree search algorithms such as A*, where their accuracy and efficiency directly impact search outcomes. Traditionally, such heuristics are handcrafted, requiring significant expertise. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and evolutionary frameworks have opened the door to automating heuristic design. In this paper, we extend the Evolution of Heuristics (EoH) framework to investigate the automated generation of guiding heuristics for A* search. We introduce a novel domain-agnostic prompt augmentation strategy that includes the A* code into the prompt to leverage in-context learning, named Algorithmic - Contextual EoH (A-CEoH). To evaluate the effectiveness of A-CeoH, we study two problem domains: the Unit-Load Pre-Marshalling Problem (UPMP), a niche problem from warehouse logistics, and the classical sliding puzzle problem (SPP). Our computational experiments show that A-CEoH can significantly improve the quality of the generated heuristics and even outperform expert-designed heuristics.

Abstract: With the development of foundation model (FM), agentic AI systems are getting more attention, yet their inherent issues like hallucination and poor reasoning, coupled with the frequent ad-hoc nature of system design, lead to unreliable and brittle applications. Existing efforts to characterise agentic design patterns often lack a rigorous systems-theoretic foundation, resulting in high-level or convenience-based taxonomies that are difficult to implement. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a principled methodology for engineering robust AI agents. We propose two primary contributions: first, a novel system-theoretic framework that deconstructs an agentic AI system into five core, interacting functional subsystems: Reasoning & World Model, Perception & Grounding, Action Execution, Learning & Adaptation, and Inter-Agent Communication. Second, derived from this architecture and directly mapped to a comprehensive taxonomy of agentic challenges, we present a collection of 12 agentic design patterns. These patterns - categorised as Foundational, Cognitive & Decisional, Execution & Interaction, and Adaptive & Learning - offer reusable, structural solutions to recurring problems in agent design. The utility of the framework is demonstrated by a case study on the ReAct framework, showing how the proposed patterns can rectify systemic architectural deficiencies. This work provides a foundational language and a structured methodology to standardise agentic design communication among researchers and engineers, leading to more modular, understandable, and reliable autonomous systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly paired with activation-based monitoring to detect and prevent harmful behaviors that may not be apparent at the surface-text level. However, existing activation safety approaches, trained on broad misuse datasets, struggle with poor precision, limited flexibility, and lack of interpretability. This paper introduces a new paradigm: rule-based activation safety, inspired by rule-sharing practices in cybersecurity. We propose modeling activations as cognitive elements (CEs), fine-grained, interpretable factors such as ''making a threat'' and ''payment processing'', that can be composed to capture nuanced, domain-specific behaviors with higher precision. Building on this representation, we present a practical framework that defines predicate rules over CEs and detects violations in real time. This enables practitioners to configure and update safeguards without retraining models or detectors, while supporting transparency and auditability. Our results show that compositional rule-based activation safety improves precision, supports domain customization, and lays the groundwork for scalable, interpretable, and auditable AI governance. We will release GAVEL as an open-source framework and provide an accompanying automated rule creation tool.

Abstract: There are challenges that must be overcome to make recommender systems useful in healthcare settings. The reasons are varied: the lack of publicly available clinical data, the difficulty that users may have in understanding the reasons why a recommendation was made, the risks that may be involved in following that recommendation, and the uncertainty about its effectiveness. In this work, we address these challenges with a recommendation model that leverages the structure of psychometric data to provide visual explanations that are faithful to the model and interpretable by care professionals. We focus on a narrow healthcare niche, gerontological primary care, to show that the proposed recommendation model can assist the attending professional in the creation of personalised care plans. We report results of a comparative offline performance evaluation of the proposed model on healthcare datasets that were collected by research partners in Brazil, as well as the results of a user study that evaluates the interpretability of the visual explanations the model generates. The results suggest that the proposed model can advance the application of recommender systems in this healthcare niche, which is expected to grow in demand , opportunities, and information technology needs as demographic changes become more pronounced.

Abstract: We address the task of routing natural language queries in multi-database enterprise environments. We construct realistic benchmarks by extending existing NL-to-SQL datasets. Our study shows that routing becomes increasingly challenging with larger, domain-overlapping DB repositories and ambiguous queries, motivating the need for more structured and robust reasoning-based solutions. By explicitly modelling schema coverage, structural connectivity, and fine-grained semantic alignment, the proposed modular, reasoning-driven reranking strategy consistently outperforms embedding-only and direct LLM-prompting baselines across all the metrics.

Abstract: Humans construct internal world models and reason by manipulating the concepts within these models. Recent advances in AI, particularly chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, approximate such human cognitive abilities, where world models are believed to be embedded within large language models. Expert-level performance in formal and abstract domains such as mathematics and programming has been achieved in current systems by relying predominantly on verbal reasoning. However, they still lag far behind humans in domains like physical and spatial intelligence, which require richer representations and prior knowledge. The emergence of unified multimodal models (UMMs) capable of both verbal and visual generation has therefore sparked interest in more human-like reasoning grounded in complementary multimodal pathways, though their benefits remain unclear. From a world-model perspective, this paper presents the first principled study of when and how visual generation benefits reasoning. Our key position is the visual superiority hypothesis: for certain tasks--particularly those grounded in the physical world--visual generation more naturally serves as world models, whereas purely verbal world models encounter bottlenecks arising from representational limitations or insufficient prior knowledge. Theoretically, we formalize internal world modeling as a core component of CoT reasoning and analyze distinctions among different forms of world models. Empirically, we identify tasks that necessitate interleaved visual-verbal CoT reasoning, constructing a new evaluation suite, VisWorld-Eval. Controlled experiments on a state-of-the-art UMM show that interleaved CoT significantly outperforms purely verbal CoT on tasks that favor visual world modeling, but offers no clear advantage otherwise. Together, this work clarifies the potential of multimodal world modeling for more powerful, human-like multimodal AI.

Abstract: Traffic shaping and Quality of Service (QoS) enforcement are critical for managing bandwidth, latency, and fairness in networks. These tasks often rely on low-level traffic control settings, which require manual setup and technical expertise. This paper presents an automated framework that converts high-level traffic shaping intents in natural or declarative language into valid and correct traffic control rules. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first end-to-end pipeline that ties intent translation in a queuing-theoretic semantic model and, with a rule-based critic, yields deployable Linux traffic control configuration sets. The framework has three steps: (1) a queuing simulation with priority scheduling and Active Queue Management (AQM) builds a semantic model; (2) a language model, using this semantic model and a traffic profile, generates sub-intents and configuration rules; and (3) a rule-based critic checks and adjusts the rules for correctness and policy compliance. We evaluate multiple language models by generating traffic control commands from business intents that comply with relevant standards for traffic control protocols. Experimental results on 100 intents show significant gains, with LLaMA3 reaching 0.88 semantic similarity and 0.87 semantic coverage, outperforming other models by over 30\. A thorough sensitivity study demonstrates that AQM-guided prompting reduces variability threefold compared to zero-shot baselines.

Abstract: This work presents (i) a framework for certifying small-signal frequency stability of a power system with line dynamics and heterogeneous bus dynamics, (ii) a novel reduced-order model of damper windings in synchronous machines, and (iii) a proportional-derivative (PD) damper winding emulation control for voltage-source converters (VSCs). Damper windings have long been understood to improve the frequency synchronization between machines. However, the dynamics of the damper windings are complex, making them difficult to analyze and directly emulate in the control of VSCs. This paper derives a reduced-order model of the damper windings as a PD term that allows grid-forming controls for VSCs to emulate their effect on frequency dynamics. Next, a framework for certifying small-signal frequency stability of a network with heterogeneous bus dynamics is developed that extends prior results by incorporating line dynamics. Finally, we analytically demonstrate that PD damper winding emulation can improve the stability of grid-forming converter controls. These results are validated with electromagnetic-transient (EMT) simulation.

Abstract: The prosthetic socket is an essential part in ensuring comfort and stability for the overall prosthesis system. This study proposes a multi-material/thickness individualized transtibial prosthetic socket that focuses on providing comfort. This study aims to identify the proper material and thickness to protect Calf areas and reduce the pressure around bone areas. First, the socket is divided into four parts depending on the pressure-sensitive/tolerant regions. After identifying the thickness range for each concerned area, the thickness and material are selected based on the Pressure-Pain Threshold (PPT) test, and the finalized design is then prototyped. The prototyped individualized socket (i-Socket) is 22% lighter than the participant's own socket. Results of the pilot experiments with an amputee participant showed that the pressure inside the socket decreased by 45% and 31% for the Tibia and Fibula regions, respectively. Additionally, the self-selected CoM velocity for the walking experiment is increased by 15% compared to the similar studies in the literature. Regarding the kinematic results, symmetry in the knee and ankle joints increased by 65% and 2% when using the i-Socket compared to the results with the participant's own socket.

Abstract: This paper presents a theory-to-hardware framework for fully passive millimeter-wave beam control aimed at extending indoor coverage. The reflecting aperture is modeled using an equivalent array-factor formulation in which each passive element contributes a reradiated field determined by the incident and desired departure angles. Building on this model, we develop two implementation-friendly passive design approaches: (i) binary (1-bit) spatial masking, which enables beam steering and multi-beam synthesis by selecting element participation on a dense lattice via an ON/OFF metallization pattern, and (ii) diffraction-order (periodic) steering, which exploits controlled aperture periodicity to place selected diffraction orders at prescribed angles. Theoretical analysis characterizes the asymptotic activation behavior of the binary mask and establishes a distribution-free lower-bound on the achievable gain. Prototypes are realized using a copper-backed 3D-printed substrate with stencil-guided conductive ink deposition. 60 GHz over-the-air measurements in single- and multi-beam configurations validate the predicted steering behavior. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate that fully passive, binary-coded apertures can provide deterministic beam control and offer a scalable alternative to power-consuming reconfigurable surfaces for static indoor links.

Conclusion: 连续时间调度模型能够提供更准确的动态价格信号，比传统离散时间调度更能反映电力市场的实际供需变化，有助于减少价格扭曲和提高市场运行效率。

Abstract: As load varies continuously over time, it is essential to provide continuous-time price signals that accurately reflect supply-demand balance. However, conventional discrete-time economic dispatch fails to capture the intra-temporal variations in load and generation. Its dual solution--the marginal price--may distort economic signals, leading to inefficient market incentives. To analyze these issues, this paper develops a continuous-time dispatch model and derives its dual formulation for price analysis. The continuous-time dispatch produces dual variables that can be interpreted as price signals. Piecewise time-indexed generation and price trajectories are then constructed through a parametric programming approach. The resulting price, represented by the Lagrange multiplier of the system-wide power balance constraint, evolves piecewise along the continuous-time load profile. Each segment corresponds to a critical region characterized by a set of active constraints. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of unit-specific ramping constraints on price implications. Results indicate that continuous-time generation and price trajectories provide deeper insights into the price distortions and inefficient incentives inherent in discrete-time formulations. The proposed methodology is validated on an illustrative 5-bus system and a modified IEEE RTS-2019.

Abstract: This study treats transmission scheduling for remote state estimation over unreliable channels with a hidden mode. A local Kalman estimator selects scheduling actions, such as power allocation and resource usage, and communicates with a remote estimator based on acknowledgement feedback, balancing estimation performance and communication cost. The resulting problem is naturally formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). In settings with observable channel modes, it is well known that monotonicity of the value function can be established via investigating order-preserving property of transition kernels. In contrast, under partial observability, the transition kernels generally lack this property, which prevents the direct application of standard monotonicity arguments. To overcome this difficulty, we introduce a novel technique, referred to as state-space folding, which induces transformed transition kernels recovering order preservation on the folded space. This transformation enables a rigorous monotonicity analysis in the partially observable setting. As a representative implication, we focus on an associated optimal stopping formulation and show that the resulting optimal scheduling policy admits a threshold structure.

Abstract: Wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) is fundamentally constrained by limited wireless bandwidth, resulting in low imaging resolution and frame rate, which can cause motion blur and missed lesions. Although adaptive frame-rate schemes have been explored to accommodate transient gastrointestinal (GI) motility, these approaches typically require sacrificing image resolution. The use of higher-frequency communication bands is further limited by increased tissue attenuation. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and WiFi communication architecture that combines the low-power operation of BLE with the high data throughput of WiFi. We systematically evaluate the performance of BLE and WiFi under tissue-mimicking conditions by measuring throughput, received signal strength indicator (RSSI), and power consumption. The results demonstrate that amplified BLE with an adaptive transmission power control strategy provides a stable frame rate at low power consumption, while 2.4 GHz WiFi operating in station mode is the most suitable high-throughput communication configuration for WCE. Compared with WiFi, BLE reduces power consumption by approximately ten times, whereas WiFi achieves up to ten times higher throughput. To reconcile these complementary trade-offs, we further introduce a hybrid system with a frame-boundary-synchronized switching mechanism to ensure lossless data transmission during BLE and WiFi transitions. Experimental results show that the switching latency from BLE to WiFi is approximately 92.66 ms, which is longer than the WiFi-to-BLE switching latency of 15.49 ms when transmitting 10 kB image payloads. Overall, the proposed hybrid BLE and WiFi system enables robust, lossless, and energy-efficient mode switching, supports adaptive imaging, and advances the development of next-generation autonomous WCE platforms.

Abstract: Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) has been widely adopted in wearable devices; however, it has not been widely used in ingestible electronics, primarily due to concerns regarding severe tissue attenuation at the 2.4 GHz band. In this work, we systematically reevaluate the feasibility of BLE for ingestible applications by benchmarking its performance against representative sub-GHz communication schemes across power consumption, throughput, tissue-induced attenuation, latency, and system-level integration constraints. We demonstrate that incorporating an RF amplifier enables BLE to maintain robust communication links through tissue-mimicking media while preserving favorable energy efficiency. We further quantify the relationship between throughput and energy consumption over a wide operating range and demonstrate that, for the majority of ingestible sensing applications with throughput requirements below 100 kbps, BLE achieves substantially lower power consumption than sub-GHz alternatives. End-to-end latency measurements show that BLE offers significantly lower latency than sub-GHz solutions due to its native compatibility with modern computing infrastructure. Finally, we analyze antenna form factor and ecosystem integration, highlighting the mechanical and translational advantages of BLE in ingestible system design. Collectively, these results demonstrate that BLE, when appropriately configured, represents a compelling and scalable wireless communication solution for next-generation ingestible electronics.

Abstract: Stabilizing a dynamical system is a fundamental problem that serves as a cornerstone for many complex tasks in the field of control systems. The problem becomes challenging when the system model is unknown. Among the Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms that have been successfully applied to solve problems pertaining to unknown linear dynamical systems, the policy gradient (PG) method stands out due to its ease of implementation and can solve the problem in a model-free manner. However, most of the existing works on PG methods for unknown linear dynamical systems assume full-state feedback. In this paper, we take a step towards model-free learning for partially observable linear dynamical systems with output feedback and focus on the fundamental stabilization problem of the system. We propose an algorithmic framework that stretches the boundary of PG methods to the problem without global convergence guarantees. We show that by leveraging zeroth-order PG update based on system trajectories and its convergence to stationary points, the proposed algorithms return a stabilizing output feedback policy for discrete-time linear dynamical systems. We also explicitly characterize the sample complexity of our algorithm and verify the effectiveness of the algorithm using numerical examples.

By simplifying the complex, nonlinear mixed integer problem, the proposed controller achieves computational efficiency, enabling real-time implementation. To evaluate its performance, traffic scenarios from both Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) and real-world road tests are employed.

We apply AutoRegressive with eXogenous inputs (ARX)-based predictive control and its Transient Predictive Control (TPC) variant, and compare them with Data-enabled Predictive Control (DeePC) and two standard model-based controllers. The methods are evaluated in simulation on a system exhibiting both inter-area and local oscillation modes. ARX-based predictive control and DeePC both achieve effective damping, while the ARX-based methods require less online computation. Using warm-started, pre-factorized operator-splitting solvers, ARX/TPC control actions are computed in less than 1ms. These results demonstrate that DPC is a viable approach for power-system oscillation damping for the given test case.

Conclusion: 频域控制能够实现无Nadir的惯量中心频率响应，并通过根轨迹方法提供系统的振荡稳定性分析和调优指导，在弱电网条件下比虚拟惯性控制具有更好的性能表现。

Abstract: Frequency control following a contingency event is of vital concern in power system operations. Leveraging inverter-based resources, it is not hard to shape the center of inertia (COI) frequency nicely. However, under weak grid conditions, it becomes insufficient to solely shape the COI frequency since this aggregate signal fails to reveal the inter-area oscillations. In this manuscript, we advocate for foolproof fine-tuning rules for \emph{frequency shaping control} (FS) based on a systematic analysis of damping ratio and decay rate of inter-area oscillations to simultaneously meet specified metrics for frequency security and oscillatory stability. To this end, building on a modal decomposition, we simplify the oscillation damping problem into a pole-placement task for a set of scalar subsystems, which can be efficiently solved by only investigating the root locus of a scalar subsystem associated with the main mode, while FS inherently guarantees a Nadir-less COI frequency response. Through our proposed root-locus-based oscillatory stability analysis, we derive closed-form expressions for the minimum damping ratio and decay rate among inter-area oscillations in terms of networked system and control parameters under FS. Moreover, we propose useful tuning guidelines for FS which need only simple calculations or visualized tuning to not only shape the COI frequency into a first-order response that converges to a steady-state value within the allowed range but also ensure a satisfactory damping ratio and decay rate of inter-area oscillations following disturbances. As for the common virtual inertia control (VI), although similar oscillatory stability analysis becomes intractable, one can still glean some insights via the root locus method. Numerical simulations validate the proposed tuning for FS as well as the superiority of FS over VI in exponential convergence rate.

Abstract: Accurately modeling and controlling vehicle exhaust emissions during transient events, such as rapid acceleration, is critical for meeting environmental regulations and optimizing powertrains. Conventional data-driven methods, such as Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, improve upon phenomenological models but often struggle with the complex nonlinear dynamics of emission formation. These monolithic architectures are sensitive to dataset variability and typically require deep, computationally expensive structures to perform well, limiting their practical utility. This paper introduces a novel approach that overcomes these limitations by modeling emission dynamics within a structured latent space. Leveraging a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA), the proposed framework learns from a rich dataset that combines real-world Portable Emission Measurement System (PEMS) data with high-frequency hardware-in-the-loop measurements. The model abstracts away irrelevant noise, encoding only the key factors governing emission behavior into a compact, robust representation. This results in superior data efficiency and predictive accuracy across diverse transient regimes, significantly outperforming high-performing LSTM baselines in generalization. To ensure suitability for real-world deployment, the JEPA framework is structured to support pruning and post-training quantization. This strategy drastically reduces the computational footprint, minimizing inference time and memory demand with negligible accuracy loss. The result is a highly efficient model ideal for on-board implementation of advanced strategies, such as model predictive control or model-based reinforcement learning, in conventional and hybrid powertrains. These findings offer a clear pathway toward more robust emission control systems for next-generation vehicles.

Abstract: This work explores the scope of Frequent Sequence Mining in the domain of Lossy Image Compression. The proposed work is based on the idea of clustering pixels and using the cluster identifiers in the compression. The DCT phase in JPEG is replaced with a combination of closed frequent sequence mining and k-means clustering to handle the redundant data effectively. This method focuses mainly on applying k-means clustering in parallel to all blocks of each component of the image to reduce the compression time. Conventional GSP algorithm is refined to optimize the cardinality of patterns through a novel pruning strategy, thus achieving a good reduction in the code table size. Simulations of the proposed algorithm indicate significant gains in compression ratio and quality in relation to the existing alternatives.

Abstract: We aim to enhance ophthalmologists' decision-making when diagnosing the Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration (nAMD). We developed three tools to analyze Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography images: (1) extracting biomarkers such as mCNV area and vessel density using image processing; (2) generating a 3D visualization of the neovascularization for a better view of the affected regions; and (3) applying an ensemble of three white box machine learning algorithms (decision tree, support vector machines and DL-Learner) for nAMD diagnosis. The learned expressions reached 100% accuracy for the training data and 68% accuracy in testing. The main advantage is that all the learned models white-box, which ensures explainability and transparency, allowing clinicians to better understand the decision-making process.

Abstract: Popularized by their strong image generation performance, diffusion and related methods for generative modeling have found widespread success in visual media applications. In particular, diffusion methods have enabled new approaches to data compression, where realistic reconstructions can be generated at extremely low bit-rates. This article provides a unifying review of recent diffusion-based methods for generative lossy compression, with a focus on image compression. These methods generally encode the source into an embedding and employ a diffusion model to iteratively refine it in the decoding procedure, such that the final reconstruction approximately follows the ground truth data distribution. The embedding can take various forms and is typically transmitted via an auxiliary entropy model, and recent methods also explore the use of diffusion models themselves for information transmission via channel simulation. We review representative approaches through the lens of rate-distortion-perception theory, highlighting the role of common randomness and connections to inverse problems, and identify open challenges.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了k-means颜色量化在RGB、CIE-XYZ和CIE-LUV/CIE-HCL色彩空间的表现，发现不同色彩空间在不同量化级别下各有优劣，并分析了图像特征如何影响最佳色彩空间选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来研究表明k-means算法在基于人类感知的色彩空间中表现更好，但缺乏系统比较。本研究旨在探究k-means颜色量化在不同色彩空间中的性能差异，并分析图像特征如何影响量化效果。

Method: 在148幅多样化数字图像上，分别在RGB、CIE-XYZ、CIE-LUV/CIE-HCL色彩空间中应用k-means算法进行四个级别的颜色量化，使用视觉信息保真度(VIF)指标评估量化图像质量。

Result: 结果显示：约半数情况下RGB空间表现最佳；在高量化级别(k值较大)时，CIE-XYZ空间通常表现更好；而在低k值时，CIE-LUV空间有时表现最佳。进一步分析表明图像的色调、色度和亮度分布会影响不同色彩空间的量化效果。

Conclusion: k-means颜色量化的最佳色彩空间选择取决于量化级别和图像特征，没有单一最优色彩空间。RGB空间在约50%情况下表现良好，但在高量化级别时CIE-XYZ空间更具优势，而CIE-LUV空间在低量化级别时对特定图像类型表现更好。

Abstract: Color quantization represents an image using a fraction of its original number of colors while only minimally losing its visual quality. The $k$-means algorithm is commonly used in this context, but has mostly been applied in the machine-based RGB colorspace composed of the three primary colors. However, some recent studies have indicated its improved performance in human perception-based colorspaces. We investigated the performance of $k$-means color quantization at four quantization levels in the RGB, CIE-XYZ, and CIE-LUV/CIE-HCL colorspaces, on 148 varied digital images spanning a wide range of scenes, subjects and settings. The Visual Information Fidelity (VIF) measure numerically assessed the quality of the quantized images, and showed that in about half of the cases, $k$-means color quantization is best in the RGB space, while at other times, and especially for higher quantization levels ($k$), the CIE-XYZ colorspace is where it usually does better. There are also some cases, especially at lower $k$, where the best performance is obtained in the CIE-LUV colorspace. Further analysis of the performances in terms of the distributions of the hue, chromaticity and luminance in an image presents a nuanced perspective and characterization of the images for which each colorspace is better for $k$-means color quantization.

Abstract: Fluorescence microscopy (FM) imaging is a fundamental technique for observing live cell division, one of the most essential processes in the cycle of life and death. Observing 3D live cells requires scanning through the cell volume while minimizing lethal phototoxicity. That limits acquisition time and results in sparsely sampled volumes with anisotropic resolution and high noise. Existing image restoration methods, primarily based on inverse problem modeling, assume known and stable degradation processes and struggle under such conditions, especially in the absence of high-quality reference volumes. In this paper, from a new perspective, we propose a novel tensor completion framework tailored to the nature of FM imaging, which inherently involves nonlinear signal degradation and incomplete observations. Specifically, FM imaging with equidistant Z-axis sampling is essentially a tensor completion task under a uniformly random sampling condition. On one hand, we derive the theoretical lower bound for exact cell tensor completion, validating the feasibility of accurately recovering 3D cell tensor. On the other hand, we reformulate the tensor completion problem as a mathematically equivalent score-based generative model. By incorporating structural consistency priors, the generative trajectory is effectively guided toward denoised and geometrically coherent reconstructions. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on SR-CACO-2 and three real \textit{in vivo} cellular datasets, showing substantial improvements in both signal-to-noise ratio and structural fidelity.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种高效的MR横向弛豫时间T2′模拟方法，通过线性相位模型直接模拟洛伦兹函数，避免传统方法需要100+等色点的需求，计算时间仅增加2-2.7倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在MR仿真中，有效横向弛豫时间T2*包含可逆(T2′)和不可逆(T2)两个分量。T2的模拟相对容易，而T2′的模拟在仅模拟单个等色点磁化强度时较为困难，传统方法需要大量等色点来近似洛伦兹函数

Method: 提出使用线性相位模型直接模拟整个洛伦兹函数，避免传统近似方法。该方法通过模拟磁化强度对频率轴的偏导数来表示线性相位模型。为加速偏导数模拟，引入了两种技术：解析解和组合转换。首先使用单个等色点模拟验证基本原理，然后使用两个体模（包含和不包含T2′模拟）对多个脉冲序列进行实际案例评估

Result: 单等色点模拟证明T2′模拟的可行性。在实际案例中，T2′如预期恢复且无需每个点使用100+等色点。包含T2′模拟的计算时间仅比不包含时延长2.0-2.7倍。使用解析解技术加速19倍，组合转换技术加速最高达17倍

Conclusion: 理论和结果表明，所提出的方法通过利用带洛伦兹函数的线性模型、解析解和组合转换技术，能够高效模拟T2′弛豫过程，大幅减少了传统方法所需的计算资源

Abstract: Purpose: To simulate effective transverse relaxation ($T_2^*$) as a part of MR simulation. $T_2^*$ consists of reversible ($T_2^{\prime}$) and irreversible ($T_2$) components. Whereas simulations of $T_2$ are easy, $T_2^{\prime}$ is not easily simulated if only magnetizations of individual isochromats are simulated.
  Theory and Methods: Efficient methods for simulating $T_2^{\prime}$ were proposed. To approximate the Lorentzian function of $T_2^{\prime}$ realistically, conventional simulators require 100+ isochromats. This approximation can be avoided by utilizing a linear phase model for simulating an entire Lorentzian function directly. To represent the linear phase model, the partial derivatives of the magnetizations with respect to the frequency axis were also simulated. To accelerate the simulations with these partial derivatives, the proposed methods introduced two techniques: analytic solutions, and combined transitions. For understanding the fundamental mechanism of the proposed method, a simple one-isochromat simulation was performed. For evaluating realistic cases, several pulse sequences were simulated using two phantoms with and without $T_2^{\prime}$ simulations.
  Results: The one-isochromat simulation demonstrated that $T_2^{\prime}$ simulations were possible. In the realistic cases, $T_2^{\prime}$ was recovered as expected without using 100+ isochromats for each point. The computational times with $T_2^{\prime}$ simulations were only 2.0 to 2.7 times longer than those without $T_2^{\prime}$ simulations. When the above-mentioned two techniques were utilized, the analytic solutions accelerated 19 times, and the combined transitions accelerated up to 17 times.
  Conclusion: Both theory and results showed that the proposed methods simulated $T_2^{\prime}$ efficiently by utilizing a linear model with a Lorentzian function, analytic solutions, and combined transitions.

Conclusion: 提出的强化学习框架有效解决了神经视频压缩中的码率控制问题，实现了精确的码率分配和参数决策，适合实际部署。

Abstract: Neural video compression (NVC) has demonstrated superior compression efficiency, yet effective rate control remains a significant challenge due to complex temporal dependencies. Existing rate control schemes typically leverage frame content to capture distortion interactions, overlooking inter-frame rate dependencies arising from shifts in per-frame coding parameters. This often leads to suboptimal bitrate allocation and cascading parameter decisions. To address this, we propose a reinforcement-learning (RL)-based rate control framework that formulates the task as a frame-by-frame sequential decision process. At each frame, an RL agent observes a spatiotemporal state and selects coding parameters to optimize a long-term reward that reflects rate-distortion (R-D) performance and bitrate adherence. Unlike prior methods, our approach jointly determines bitrate allocation and coding parameters in a single step, independent of group of pictures (GOP) structure. Extensive experiments across diverse NVC architectures show that our method reduces the average relative bitrate error to 1.20% and achieves up to 13.45% bitrate savings at typical GOP sizes, outperforming existing approaches. In addition, our framework demonstrates improved robustness to content variation and bandwidth fluctuations with lower coding overhead, making it highly suitable for practical deployment.

Abstract: Multimodal MRI is essential for brain tumor segmentation, yet missing modalities in clinical practice cause existing methods to exhibit >40% performance variance across modality combinations, rendering them clinically unreliable. We propose AMGFormer, achieving significantly improved stability through three synergistic modules: (1) QuadIntegrator Bridge (QIB) enabling spatially adaptive fusion maintaining consistent predictions regardless of available modalities, (2) Multi-Granular Attention Orchestrator (MGAO) focusing on pathological regions to reduce background sensitivity, and (3) Modality Quality-Aware Enhancement (MQAE) preventing error propagation from corrupted sequences. On BraTS 2018, our method achieves 89.33% WT, 82.70% TC, 67.23% ET Dice scores with <0.5% variance across 15 modality combinations, solving the stability crisis. Single-modality ET segmentation shows 40-81% relative improvements over state-of-the-art methods. The method generalizes to BraTS 2020/2021, achieving up to 92.44% WT, 89.91% TC, 84.57% ET. The model demonstrates potential for clinical deployment with 1.2s inference. Code: https://github.com/guochengxiangives/AMGFormer.

Abstract: Echocardiography is a cornerstone for managing heart failure (HF), with Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) being a critical metric for guiding therapy. However, manual LVEF assessment suffers from high inter-observer variability, while existing Deep Learning (DL) models are often computationally intensive and data-hungry "black boxes" that impede clinical trust and adoption. Here, we propose a backpropagation-free multi-task Green Learning (MTGL) framework that performs simultaneous Left Ventricle (LV) segmentation and LVEF classification. Our framework integrates an unsupervised VoxelHop encoder for hierarchical spatio-temporal feature extraction with a multi-level regression decoder and an XG-Boost classifier. On the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, our MTGL model achieves state-of-the-art classification and segmentation performance, attaining a classification accuracy of 94.3% and a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.912, significantly outperforming several advanced 3D DL models. Crucially, our model achieves this with over an order of magnitude fewer parameters, demonstrating exceptional computational efficiency. This work demonstrates that the GL paradigm can deliver highly accurate, efficient, and interpretable solutions for complex medical image analysis, paving the way for more sustainable and trustworthy artificial intelligence in clinical practice.

Abstract: Optimal reconstruction of a source sequence from multiple noisy traces corrupted by random insertions, deletions, and substitutions typically requires joint processing of all traces, leading to computational complexity that grows exponentially with the number of traces. In this work, we propose an iterative belief-combining procedure that computes symbol-wise a posteriori probabilities by propagating trace-wise inferences via message passing. We prove that, upon convergence, our method achieves the same reconstruction performance as joint maximum a posteriori estimation, while reducing the complexity to quadratic in the number of traces. This performance equivalence is validated using a real-world dataset of clustered short-strand DNA reads.

Abstract: Quantum differential privacy provides a rigorous framework for quantifying privacy guarantees in quantum information processing. While classical correlations are typically regarded as adversarial to privacy, the role of their quantum analogue, entanglement, is not well understood. In this work, we investigate how quantum entanglement fundamentally shapes quantum local differential privacy (QLDP). We consider a bipartite quantum system whose input state has a prescribed level of entanglement, characterized by a lower bound on the entanglement entropy. Each subsystem is then processed by a local quantum mechanism and measured using local operations only, ensuring that no additional entanglement is generated during the process. Our main result reveals a sharp phase-transition phenomenon in the relation between entanglement and QLDP: below a mechanism-dependent entropy threshold, the optimal privacy leakage level mirrors that of unentangled inputs; beyond this threshold, the privacy leakage level decreases with the entropy, which strictly improves privacy guarantees and can even turn some non-private mechanisms into private ones. The phase-transition phenomenon gives rise to a nonlinear dependence of the privacy leakage level on the entanglement entropy, even though the underlying quantum mechanisms and measurements are linear. We show that the transition is governed by the intrinsic non-convex geometry of the set of entanglement-constrained quantum states, which we parametrize as a smooth manifold and analyze via Riemannian optimization. Our findings demonstrate that entanglement serves as a genuine privacy-enhancing resource, offering a geometric and operational foundation for designing robust privacy-preserving quantum protocols.

Abstract: Vehicular platooning refers to coordinated and close movement of vehicular users (VUs) traveling together along a common route segment, offering strategic benefits such as reduced fuel costs, lower emissions, and improved traffic flow. {Highways offer a natural setting for platooning due to extended travel distances, yet their potential remains underexplored, particularly in terms of communication and connectivity. Given that effective platooning relies on robust vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links, understanding connectivity dynamics on highways is essential.} In this paper, we analyze the dynamics of vehicular platooning on a highway and its impact on the performance of two forms of vehicular communications -- namely V2V and V2I communication -- compared to independent vehicle movement on a highway. The vehicular networks consists of road-side units (RSUs), modeled as a 1D Poisson point process (PPP), to provide the vehicular connectivity to the VUs. VUs are modeled as 1D PPP under the non-platooned traffic scenario (N-PTS) and as a 1D Matern cluster process (MCP) under the platooned traffic scenario (PTS). We evaluate the distribution on the per-RSU load, representing the number of VUs served, for the typical and tagged RSU. Additionally, we derive coverage probability (CP) and rate coverage (RC), which measures the probability of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and achievable rate above a specified threshold at the typical VU along with their meta distribution (MD), providing a deeper understanding of the reliability and variability of these metrics across different spatial distributions of VUs and RSUs. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through simulations and provide numerical insights into the impact of different traffic patterns on RSU load distribution, CP, and RC performance.

Motivation: 传统的Pinching天线系统研究大多假设完美的信道状态信息或理想的用户定位，但实际中常存在定位不确定性。先前工作考虑均匀分布的定位误差过于简化，未能准确反映现实中的高斯分布定位误差，因此需要更贴近实际场景的鲁棒资源分配方案。

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了针对高斯分布定位误差的鲁棒资源分配框架，通过联合优化功率分配和天线位置，为Pinching天线系统在实际部署中提供了有效的解决方案，特别是在高频段通信场景中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Pinching antenna systems have attracted much attention recently owing to its capability to maintain reliable line-of-sight (LoS) communication in high-frequency bands. By guiding signals through a waveguide and emitting them via a movable pinching antenna, these systems enable dynamic control of signal propagation and spatial adaptability. However, their performance heavily depends on effective resource allocation-encompassing power, bandwidth, and antenna positioning-which becomes challenging under imperfect channel state information (CSI) and user localization uncertainty. Existing studies largely assume perfect CSI or ideal user positioning, while our prior work considered uniform localization errors, an oversimplified assumption. In this paper, we develop a robust resource allocation framework for multiuser downlink pinching antenna systems under Gaussian-distributed localization uncertainty, which more accurately models real-world positioning errors. An energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem is formulated subject to probabilistic outage constraints, and an analytical power allocation strategy is derived under given antenna positions. On this basis, the heuristic particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed to identify the antenna position that achieves the global EE configuration. Simulation results illustrate that the proposed scheme greatly enhances both EE and system reliability compared with fixed-antenna benchmark, validating its effectiveness for practical high-frequency wireless deployments.
