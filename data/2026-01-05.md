Abstract: World models aim to endow AI systems with the ability to represent, generate, and interact with dynamic environments in a coherent and temporally consistent manner. While recent video generation models have demonstrated impressive visual quality, they remain limited in real-time interaction, long-horizon consistency, and persistent memory of dynamic scenes, hindering their evolution into practical world models. In this report, we present TeleWorld, a real-time multimodal 4D world modeling framework that unifies video generation, dynamic scene reconstruction, and long-term world memory within a closed-loop system. TeleWorld introduces a novel generation-reconstruction-guidance paradigm, where generated video streams are continuously reconstructed into a dynamic 4D spatio-temporal representation, which in turn guides subsequent generation to maintain spatial, temporal, and physical consistency. To support long-horizon generation with low latency, we employ an autoregressive diffusion-based video model enhanced with Macro-from-Micro Planning (MMPL)--a hierarchical planning method that reduces error accumulation from frame-level to segment-level-alongside efficient Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD), enabling real-time synthesis under practical computational budgets. Our approach achieves seamless integration of dynamic object modeling and static scene representation within a unified 4D framework, advancing world models toward practical, interactive, and computationally accessible systems. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TeleWorld achieves strong performance in both static and dynamic world understanding, long-term consistency, and real-time generation efficiency, positioning it as a practical step toward interactive, memory-enabled world models for multimodal generation and embodied intelligence.

TL;DR: 本文提出通过噪声优化来解决文本到图像生成模型的模态坍缩问题的简单方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的文本到图像模型存在显著的模态坍缩问题，即在相同文本提示下生成的图像多样性不足。先前的研究主要通过引导机制或大规模候选集筛选来应对，本文另辟蹊径，探索通过噪声优化来增加生成多样性。

Method: 采用简单的噪声优化目标来缓解模态坍缩，同时保持基础模型的保真度。分析噪声的频率特性，并展示具有不同频率特征的替代噪声初始化可以改善优化和搜索过程。

Result: 实验表明，噪声优化方法在生成质量和多样性方面都取得了优越的结果。

Conclusion: 噪声优化是解决文本到图像模型模态坍缩问题的有效方法，能够在不损害生成质量的前提下显著提高输出多样性。

Abstract: Contemporary text-to-image models exhibit a surprising degree of mode collapse, as can be seen when sampling several images given the same text prompt. While previous work has attempted to address this issue by steering the model using guidance mechanisms, or by generating a large pool of candidates and refining them, in this work we take a different direction and aim for diversity in generations via noise optimization. Specifically, we show that a simple noise optimization objective can mitigate mode collapse while preserving the fidelity of the base model. We also analyze the frequency characteristics of the noise and show that alternative noise initializations with different frequency profiles can improve both optimization and search. Our experiments demonstrate that noise optimization yields superior results in terms of generation quality and variety.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Spatial4D-Bench这一综合性4D空间智能基准测试，包含约40,000个问题-答案对，涵盖18个任务和6个认知类别，用于评估多模态大语言模型的4D空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类天生具备4D空间智能（感知物体随时间变化的能力），但目前尚不清楚多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）能在多大程度上达到人类水平的4D空间智能。现有空间智能基准测试通常规模较小或多样性不足，因此需要建立一个全面、大规模、多任务评估基准。

Method: 研究者开发了Spatial4D-Bench，一个包含约40,000个问题-答案对的大规模基准测试，涵盖18个明确定义的任务。这些任务被系统性地组织到六个认知类别中：物体理解、场景理解、空间关系理解、时空关系理解、空间推理和时空推理。

Result: 通过在Spatial4D-Bench上评估各种最先进的开放源码和专有MLLMs，研究发现这些模型在众多4D空间推理方面存在显著限制，如在路径规划、行为识别和物理合理性推理等任务中表现不佳。

Conclusion: 该研究的发现为社区提供了有价值的见解，Spatial4D-Bench基准测试有望促进开发出更强大、更接近人类水平4D空间智能的MLLMs。

Abstract: 4D spatial intelligence involves perceiving and processing how objects move or change over time. Humans naturally possess 4D spatial intelligence, supporting a broad spectrum of spatial reasoning abilities. To what extent can Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve human-level 4D spatial intelligence? In this work, we present Spatial4D-Bench, a versatile 4D spatial intelligence benchmark designed to comprehensively assess the 4D spatial reasoning abilities of MLLMs. Unlike existing spatial intelligence benchmarks that are often small-scale or limited in diversity, Spatial4D-Bench provides a large-scale, multi-task evaluation benchmark consisting of ~40,000 question-answer pairs covering 18 well-defined tasks. We systematically organize these tasks into six cognitive categories: object understanding, scene understanding, spatial relationship understanding, spatiotemporal relationship understanding, spatial reasoning and spatiotemporal reasoning. Spatial4D-Bench thereby offers a structured and comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the spatial cognition abilities of MLLMs, covering a broad spectrum of tasks that parallel the versatility of human spatial intelligence. We benchmark various state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary MLLMs on Spatial4D-Bench and reveal their substantial limitations in a wide variety of 4D spatial reasoning aspects, such as route plan, action recognition, and physical plausibility reasoning. We hope that the findings provided in this work offer valuable insights to the community and that our benchmark can facilitate the development of more capable MLLMs toward human-level 4D spatial intelligence.

Abstract: Human drivers rarely travel where no person has gone before. After all, thousands of drivers use busy city roads every day, and only one can claim to be the first. The same holds for autonomous computer vision systems. The vast majority of the deployment area of an autonomous vision system will have been visited before. Yet, most autonomous vehicle vision systems act as if they are encountering each location for the first time. In this work, we present Compressed Map Priors (CMP), a simple but effective framework to learn spatial priors from historic traversals. The map priors use a binarized hashmap that requires only $32\text{KB}/\text{km}^2$, a $20\times$ reduction compared to the dense storage. Compressed Map Priors easily integrate into leading 3D perception systems at little to no extra computational costs, and lead to a significant and consistent improvement in 3D object detection on the nuScenes dataset across several architectures.

TL;DR: 金融信用多模态基准FCMBench-V1.0的构建与评测，包含4,043张合规图像和8,446个QA样本，用于评估VLMs在信用风险评估中的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融信用领域的多模态AI应用缺乏反映实际文档和工作流程的领域特定基准，需要兼顾隐私合规性和实际效用

Method: 通过封闭的合成-采集流程构建基准数据，包含感知、推理、鲁棒性三个维度的评测框架，涵盖18种核心证书类型

Result: 在23个先进VLMs的评估中，Gemini 3 Pro（64.61）表现最佳商用模型，Qwen3-VL-235B（57.27）最佳开源模型，专用模型Qfin-VL-Instruct（64.92）综合最优

Conclusion: FCMBench能有效评估VLMs在金融信用领域的性能差异和鲁棒性，为实际应用提供重要参考依据

Abstract: As multimodal AI becomes widely used for credit risk assessment and document review, a domain-specific benchmark is urgently needed that (1) reflects documents and workflows specific to financial credit applications, (2) includes credit-specific understanding and real-world robustness, and (3) preserves privacy compliance without sacrificing practical utility. Here, we introduce FCMBench-V1.0 -- a large-scale financial credit multimodal benchmark for real-world applications, covering 18 core certificate types, with 4,043 privacy-compliant images and 8,446 QA samples. The FCMBench evaluation framework consists of three dimensions: Perception, Reasoning, and Robustness, including 3 foundational perception tasks, 4 credit-specific reasoning tasks that require decision-oriented understanding of visual evidence, and 10 real-world acquisition artifact types for robustness stress testing. To reconcile compliance with realism, we construct all samples via a closed synthesis-capture pipeline: we manually synthesize document templates with virtual content and capture scenario-aware images in-house. This design also mitigates pre-training data leakage by avoiding web-sourced or publicly released images. FCMBench can effectively discriminate performance disparities and robustness across modern vision-language models. Extensive experiments were conducted on 23 state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) from 14 top AI companies and research institutes. Among them, Gemini 3 Pro achieves the best F1(\%) score as a commercial model (64.61), Qwen3-VL-235B achieves the best score as an open-source baseline (57.27), and our financial credit-specific model, Qfin-VL-Instruct, achieves the top overall score (64.92). Robustness evaluations show that even top-performing models suffer noticeable performance drops under acquisition artifacts.

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an underexplored problem in facial analysis: generating and recognizing multi-attribute natural language descriptions, containing facial action units (AUs), emotional states, and age estimation, for arbitrarily selected face regions (termed FaceFocalDesc). We argue that the system's ability to focus on individual facial areas leads to better understanding and control. To achieve this capability, we construct a new multi-attribute description dataset for arbitrarily selected face regions, providing rich region-level annotations and natural language descriptions. Further, we propose a fine-tuned vision-language model based on Qwen2.5-VL, called Focal-RegionFace for facial state analysis, which incrementally refines its focus on localized facial features through multiple progressively fine-tuning stages, resulting in interpretable age estimation, FAU and emotion detection. Experimental results show that Focal-RegionFace achieves the best performance on the new benchmark in terms of traditional and widely used metrics, as well as new proposed metrics. This fully verifies its effectiveness and versatility in fine-grained multi-attribute face region-focal analysis scenarios.

TL;DR: MorphAny3D是一个无需训练就能实现高质量3D形变的框架，通过智能混合源和目标的结构化潜在表示，利用注意力机制生成语义一致且时间平滑的跨类别形变序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前3D形变技术面临挑战，特别是在跨类别情况下难以生成语义一致和时间平滑的变形。现有方法需要额外训练或难以处理复杂形变场景，因此需要一个更通用、高效的3D形变解决方案。

Method: 提出了三个核心技术：1) Morphing Cross-Attention在交叉注意力层融合源和目标特征以保证结构一致性；2) Temporal-Fused Self-Attention通过引入前面帧的特征增强时间一致性；3) 方向校正策略缓解形变过程中的姿态模糊问题。基于SLAT表示，无需训练即可应用于现有3D生成模型。

Result: 实验显示该方法在生成3D形变序列方面达到最先进的水平，特别是对具有挑战性的跨类别情况。进一步支持解耦形变和3D风格迁移等高级应用，且可泛化到其他基于SLAT的生成模型。

Conclusion: MorphAny3D通过创新的注意力机制和方向校正策略，实现了高质量的3D形变，无需额外训练即可生成语义一致且时间平滑的跨类别形变序列，为3D内容生成提供了一种高效通用的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D morphing remains challenging due to the difficulty of generating semantically consistent and temporally smooth deformations, especially across categories. We present MorphAny3D, a training-free framework that leverages Structured Latent (SLAT) representations for high-quality 3D morphing. Our key insight is that intelligently blending source and target SLAT features within the attention mechanisms of 3D generators naturally produces plausible morphing sequences. To this end, we introduce Morphing Cross-Attention (MCA), which fuses source and target information for structural coherence, and Temporal-Fused Self-Attention (TFSA), which enhances temporal consistency by incorporating features from preceding frames. An orientation correction strategy further mitigates the pose ambiguity within the morphing steps. Extensive experiments show that our method generates state-of-the-art morphing sequences, even for challenging cross-category cases. MorphAny3D further supports advanced applications such as decoupled morphing and 3D style transfer, and can be generalized to other SLAT-based generative models.

Motivation: 室外农田环境中，部分遮挡和作物聚集导致的歧义性给基于图像的作物计数带来巨大挑战，需要更精确的3D分割方法。

Method: 使用多视角2D图像和神经辐射场（NeRF）进行3D重建，结合作物可见性和掩码一致性评分实现3D实例分割。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决遮挡和作物聚集问题，提供高精度的作物计数，并贡献了棉花植物数据集促进相关研究。

Abstract: Rigorous crop counting is crucial for effective agricultural management and informed intervention strategies. However, in outdoor field environments, partial occlusions combined with inherent ambiguity in distinguishing clustered crops from individual viewpoints poses an immense challenge for image-based segmentation methods. To address these problems, we introduce a novel crop counting framework designed for exact enumeration via 3D instance segmentation. Our approach utilizes 2D images captured from multiple viewpoints and associates independent instance masks for neural radiance field (NeRF) view synthesis. We introduce crop visibility and mask consistency scores, which are incorporated alongside 3D information from a NeRF model. This results in an effective segmentation of crop instances in 3D and highly-accurate crop counts. Furthermore, our method eliminates the dependence on crop-specific parameter tuning. We validate our framework on three agricultural datasets consisting of cotton bolls, apples, and pears, and demonstrate consistent counting performance despite major variations in crop color, shape, and size. A comparative analysis against the state of the art highlights superior performance on crop counting tasks. Lastly, we contribute a cotton plant dataset to advance further research on this topic.

Motivation: 当前领域自适应方法主要关注源域与目标域之间的偏移，而缺少对域内多样性的深入探索。虽然通过多样化风格合成可以丰富合成数据，但现有方法需要预先指定域内变体，这在实践中难以实现。

Method: 提出了IntraStyler方法，这是基于示例的风格合成方法，可以通过示例指导风格合成，以确保输出样式与示例匹配。引入风格编码器，使用对比学习来判别性地提取纯风格特征。

Conclusion: IntraStyler方法能够有效解决领域自适应中的域内多样性问题，能够在无需先验知识的情况下捕捉域内多样风格，提升下游任务的性能。

Abstract: Image-level domain alignment is the de facto approach for unsupervised domain adaptation, where unpaired image translation is used to minimize the domain gap. Prior studies mainly focus on the domain shift between the source and target domains, whereas the intra-domain variability remains under-explored. To address the latter, an effective strategy is to diversify the styles of the synthetic target domain data during image translation. However, previous methods typically require intra-domain variations to be pre-specified for style synthesis, which may be impractical. In this paper, we propose an exemplar-based style synthesis method named IntraStyler, which can capture diverse intra-domain styles without any prior knowledge. Specifically, IntraStyler uses an exemplar image to guide the style synthesis such that the output style matches the exemplar style. To extract the style-only features, we introduce a style encoder to learn styles discriminatively based on contrastive learning. We evaluate the proposed method on the largest public dataset for cross-modality domain adaptation, CrossMoDA 2023. Our experiments show the efficacy of our method in controllable style synthesis and the benefits of diverse synthetic data for downstream segmentation.

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型生成的推理链缺乏对视觉信息的有效整合，限制了其在需要准确视觉感知任务上的表现，如视觉谜题。视觉感知是此类任务的关键瓶颈。

Method: 研究激励驱动的强化学习机制，设计六种针对不同推理方面（图像理解、思维步骤、答案准确性）的奖励函数，使用组相对策略优化方法，显式激励更长、结构化推理并缓解视觉信息绕过问题。

Result: 实验表明，将图像转换为文本描述可显著提升性能（Claude 3.5提高26.7%，Claude 3.7提高23.6%），在Qwen-2.5-VL-7B模型上相比基线模型获得5.56%的提升，并在领域内外均显示出一致的改善。

Conclusion: 强化学习能有效解锁开源多模态大语言模型的长视觉推理能力，无需昂贵监督，通过设计针对性奖励函数可以显著提升模型的视觉感知和推理性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for eliciting reasoning chains before generating final answers. However, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) generate reasoning that lacks integration of visual information. This limits their ability to solve problems that demand accurate visual perception, such as visual puzzles. We show that visual perception is the key bottleneck in such tasks: converting images into textual descriptions significantly improves performance, yielding gains of 26.7% for Claude 3.5 and 23.6% for Claude 3.7.
  To address this, we investigate reward-driven RL as a mechanism to unlock long visual reasoning in open-source MLLMs without requiring costly supervision. We design and evaluate six reward functions targeting different reasoning aspects, including image understanding, thinking steps, and answer accuracy. Using group relative policy optimization (GRPO), our approach explicitly incentivizes longer, structured reasoning and mitigates bypassing of visual information. Experiments on Qwen-2.5-VL-7B achieve 5.56% improvements over the base model, with consistent gains across both in-domain and out-of-domain settings.

Abstract: Vector quantization (VQ) is a prevalent and fundamental technique that discretizes continuous feature vectors by approximating them using a codebook. As the diversity and complexity of data and models continue to increase, there is an urgent need for high-capacity, yet more compact VQ methods. This paper aims to reconcile this conflict by presenting a new approach called LooC, which utilizes an effective Low-dimensional codebook for Compositional vector quantization. Firstly, LooC introduces a parameter-efficient codebook by reframing the relationship between codevectors and feature vectors, significantly expanding its solution space. Instead of individually matching codevectors with feature vectors, LooC treats them as lower-dimensional compositional units within feature vectors and combines them, resulting in a more compact codebook with improved performance. Secondly, LooC incorporates a parameter-free extrapolation-by-interpolation mechanism to enhance and smooth features during the VQ process, which allows for better preservation of details and fidelity in feature approximation. The design of LooC leads to full codebook usage, effectively utilizing the compact codebook while avoiding the problem of collapse. Thirdly, LooC can serve as a plug-and-play module for existing methods for different downstream tasks based on VQ. Finally, extensive evaluations on different tasks, datasets, and architectures demonstrate that LooC outperforms existing VQ methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance with a significantly smaller codebook.

Abstract: Blind Image Quality Assessment (BIQA) has advanced significantly through deep learning, but the scarcity of large-scale labeled datasets remains a challenge. While synthetic data offers a promising solution, models trained on existing synthetic datasets often show limited generalization ability. In this work, we make a key observation that representations learned from synthetic datasets often exhibit a discrete and clustered pattern that hinders regression performance: features of high-quality images cluster around reference images, while those of low-quality images cluster based on distortion types. Our analysis reveals that this issue stems from the distribution of synthetic data rather than model architecture. Consequently, we introduce a novel framework SynDR-IQA, which reshapes synthetic data distribution to enhance BIQA generalization. Based on theoretical derivations of sample diversity and redundancy's impact on generalization error, SynDR-IQA employs two strategies: distribution-aware diverse content upsampling, which enhances visual diversity while preserving content distribution, and density-aware redundant cluster downsampling, which balances samples by reducing the density of densely clustered areas. Extensive experiments across three cross-dataset settings (synthetic-to-authentic, synthetic-to-algorithmic, and synthetic-to-synthetic) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: PCB缺陷检测中红外(IR)数据稀缺成为关键瓶颈，传统方法依赖成对监督数据，而真实红外样本获取成本高且数量有限。如何利用丰富的可见光PCB图像来缓解红外数据不足的问题是该研究的核心动机。

Method: 1. 使用CycleGAN进行无配对图像到图像翻译，将丰富的可见光PCB图像映射到红外域，生成高保真伪红外样本；2. 提出异质训练策略，将生成的伪红外数据与有限的真实红外样本融合；3. 训练轻量级YOLOv8检测器。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法有效增强了低数据条件下的特征学习。增强后的检测器显著优于仅用有限真实数据训练的模型，并接近全监督训练的性能基准，证明了伪红外合成作为工业检测的鲁棒增强策略的有效性。

Conclusion: 跨模态数据增强框架通过CycleGAN生成伪红外数据和YOLOv8检测相结合，成功解决了PCB缺陷检测中红外数据稀缺问题，为工业检测提供了一种高效的数据增强方法，在有限真实数据条件下实现了接近全监督的性能。

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical bottleneck of infrared (IR) data scarcity in Printed Circuit Board (PCB) defect detection by proposing a cross-modal data augmentation framework integrating CycleGAN and YOLOv8. Unlike conventional methods relying on paired supervision, we leverage CycleGAN to perform unpaired image-to-image translation, mapping abundant visible-light PCB images into the infrared domain. This generative process synthesizes high-fidelity pseudo-IR samples that preserve the structural semantics of defects while accurately simulating thermal distribution patterns. Subsequently, we construct a heterogeneous training strategy that fuses generated pseudo-IR data with limited real IR samples to train a lightweight YOLOv8 detector. Experimental results demonstrate that this method effectively enhances feature learning under low-data conditions. The augmented detector significantly outperforms models trained on limited real data alone and approaches the performance benchmarks of fully supervised training, proving the efficacy of pseudo-IR synthesis as a robust augmentation strategy for industrial inspection.

Abstract: Effective pest management is crucial for enhancing agricultural productivity, especially for crops such as sugarcane and wheat that are highly vulnerable to pest infestations. Traditional pest management methods depend heavily on manual field inspections and the use of chemical pesticides. These approaches are often costly, time-consuming, labor-intensive, and can have a negative impact on the environment. To overcome these challenges, this study presents a lightweight framework for pest detection and pesticide recommendation, designed for low-resource devices such as smartphones and drones, making it suitable for use by small and marginal farmers.
  The proposed framework includes two main components. The first is a Pest Detection Module that uses a compact, lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with prototypical meta-learning to accurately identify pests even when only a few training samples are available. The second is a Pesticide Recommendation Module that incorporates environmental factors like crop type and growth stage to suggest safe and eco-friendly pesticide recommendations. To train and evaluate our framework, a comprehensive pest image dataset was developed by combining multiple publicly available datasets. The final dataset contains samples with different viewing angles, pest sizes, and background conditions to ensure strong generalization.
  Experimental results show that the proposed lightweight CNN achieves high accuracy, comparable to state-of-the-art models, while significantly reducing computational complexity. The Decision Support System additionally improves pest management by reducing dependence on traditional chemical pesticides and encouraging sustainable practices, demonstrating its potential for real-time applications in precision agriculture.

Abstract: While foundation models in radiology are expected to be applied to various clinical tasks, computational cost constraints remain a major challenge when training on 3D-CT volumetric data. In this study, we propose TotalFM, a radiological foundation model that efficiently learns the correspondence between 3D-CT images and linguistic expressions based on the concept of organ separation, utilizing a large-scale dataset of 140,000 series. By automating the creation of organ volume and finding-sentence pairs through segmentation techniques and Large Language Model (LLM)-based radiology report processing, and by combining self-supervised pre-training via VideoMAE with contrastive learning using volume-text pairs, we aimed to balance computational efficiency and representation capability. In zero-shot organ-wise lesion classification tasks, the proposed model achieved higher F1 scores in 83% (5/6) of organs compared to CT-CLIP and 64% (9/14) of organs compared to Merlin. These results suggest that the proposed model exhibits high generalization performance in a clinical evaluation setting using actual radiology report sentences. Furthermore, in zero-shot finding-wise lesion classification tasks, our model achieved a higher AUROC in 83% (25/30) of finding categories compared to Merlin. We also confirmed performance comparable to existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in radiology report generation tasks. Our results demonstrate that the organ-separated learning framework can serve as a realistic and effective design guideline for the practical implementation of 3D-CT foundation models.

Abstract: Multimodal learning has revolutionized general domain tasks, yet its application in scientific discovery is hindered by the profound semantic gap between complex scientific imagery and sparse textual descriptions. We present S1-MMAlign, a large-scale, multi-disciplinary multimodal dataset comprising over 15.5 million high-quality image-text pairs derived from 2.5 million open-access scientific papers. Spanning disciplines from physics and biology to engineering, the dataset captures diverse visual modalities including experimental setups, heatmaps, and microscopic imagery. To address the pervasive issue of weak alignment in raw scientific captions, we introduce an AI-ready semantic enhancement pipeline that utilizes the Qwen-VL multimodal large model series to recaption images by synthesizing context from paper abstracts and citation contexts. Technical validation demonstrates that this enhancement significantly improves data quality: SciBERT-based pseudo-perplexity metrics show reduced semantic ambiguity, while CLIP scores indicate an 18.21% improvement in image-text alignment. S1-MMAlign provides a foundational resource for advancing scientific reasoning and cross-modal understanding in the era of AI for Science. The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ScienceOne-AI/S1-MMAlign.

TL;DR: ActErase是一种无需训练的概念擦除方法，通过分析激活差异区域来高效移除敏感概念，同时保持模型生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的文本到图像扩散模型存在安全隐患，现有概念擦除方法大多依赖数据密集且计算成本高昂的微调过程，需要更轻量高效的解决方案。

Method: 通过识别激活差异区域提取目标激活，在正向传播过程中动态替换输入激活，避免模型重新训练。

Result: 在三个关键擦除任务（裸体、艺术风格、物体移除）上达到SOTA性能，在保持模型生成能力的同时展现出对抗攻击的强大鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ActErase为扩散模型中概念操作提供了一种新的即插即用范式，实现了轻量级且有效的概念擦除。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generation capabilities, yet they raise significant concerns regarding safety, copyright, and ethical implications. Existing concept erasure methods address these risks by removing sensitive concepts from pre-trained models, but most of them rely on data-intensive and computationally expensive fine-tuning, which poses a critical limitation. To overcome these challenges, inspired by the observation that the model's activations are predominantly composed of generic concepts, with only a minimal component can represent the target concept, we propose a novel training-free method (ActErase) for efficient concept erasure. Specifically, the proposed method operates by identifying activation difference regions via prompt-pair analysis, extracting target activations and dynamically replacing input activations during forward passes. Comprehensive evaluations across three critical erasure tasks (nudity, artistic style, and object removal) demonstrates that our training-free method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) erasure performance, while effectively preserving the model's overall generative capability. Our approach also exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, establishing a new plug-and-play paradigm for lightweight yet effective concept manipulation in diffusion models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Faithfulness hallucinations in VQA occur when vision-language models produce fluent yet visually ungrounded answers, severely undermining their reliability in safety-critical applications. Existing detection methods mainly fall into two categories: external verification approaches relying on auxiliary models or knowledge bases, and uncertainty-driven approaches using repeated sampling or uncertainty estimates. The former suffer from high computational overhead and are limited by external resource quality, while the latter capture only limited facets of model uncertainty and fail to sufficiently explore the rich internal signals associated with the diverse failure modes. Both paradigms thus have inherent limitations in efficiency, robustness, and detection performance. To address these challenges, we propose FaithSCAN: a lightweight network that detects hallucinations by exploiting rich internal signals of VLMs, including token-level decoding uncertainty, intermediate visual representations, and cross-modal alignment features. These signals are fused via branch-wise evidence encoding and uncertainty-aware attention. We also extend the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm to VQA hallucination and propose a low-cost strategy to automatically generate model-dependent supervision signals, enabling supervised training without costly human labels while maintaining high detection accuracy. Experiments on multiple VQA benchmarks show that FaithSCAN significantly outperforms existing methods in both effectiveness and efficiency. In-depth analysis shows hallucinations arise from systematic internal state variations in visual perception, cross-modal reasoning, and language decoding. Different internal signals provide complementary diagnostic cues, and hallucination patterns vary across VLM architectures, offering new insights into the underlying causes of multimodal hallucinations.

TL;DR: SV-GS框架利用稀疏多视角视频进行动态目标重建，通过骨架驱动的变形场实现运动估计和几何细节保留，在稀疏观测下超越现有方法，并能结合扩散先验减少对初始静态重建的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态重建方法需要密集的多视角视频覆盖，在现实场景（如监控摄像头）中难以实现，因为观测往往在时间和视角上都很稀疏，导致重建问题高度不适定。

Method: 提出SV-GS框架，利用粗略骨架图和初始静态重建作为输入（后期可放宽此要求），优化包含粗粒度骨架关节姿态估计器和细粒度变形模块的骨架驱动变形场，其中关节姿态估计器与时间相关以实现运动插值。

Result: 在合成数据集上，稀疏观测条件下的PSNR指标比现有方法提升高达34%；在真实数据集上，与密集单目视频方法性能相当但使用帧数显著减少；初始静态重建可由扩散生成先验替代，增强实用性。

Conclusion: SV-GS在稀疏多视角观测下能有效重建动态目标，通过分离运动建模和几何细节，实现了高质量的重建和运动插值，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Reconstructing a dynamic target moving over a large area is challenging. Standard approaches for dynamic object reconstruction require dense coverage in both the viewing space and the temporal dimension, typically relying on multi-view videos captured at each time step. However, such setups are only possible in constrained environments. In real-world scenarios, observations are often sparse over time and captured sparsely from diverse viewpoints (e.g., from security cameras), making dynamic reconstruction highly ill-posed. We present SV-GS, a framework that simultaneously estimates a deformation model and the object's motion over time under sparse observations. To initialize SV-GS, we leverage a rough skeleton graph and an initial static reconstruction as inputs to guide motion estimation. (Later, we show that this input requirement can be relaxed.) Our method optimizes a skeleton-driven deformation field composed of a coarse skeleton joint pose estimator and a module for fine-grained deformations. By making only the joint pose estimator time-dependent, our model enables smooth motion interpolation while preserving learned geometric details. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that our method outperforms existing approaches under sparse observations by up to 34% in PSNR, and achieves comparable performance to dense monocular video methods on real-world datasets despite using significantly fewer frames. Moreover, we demonstrate that the input initial static reconstruction can be replaced by a diffusion-based generative prior, making our method more practical for real-world scenarios.

By leveraging pretraining on publicly available skin disease image datasets, our model effectively extracted visual features and accurately classified various dermatological cases. Throughout the project, we refined the model architecture, optimized data preprocessing workflows, and applied targeted data augmentation techniques to improve overall performance. The final model, based on the Swin Transformer, achieved a prediction accuracy of 87.71 percent across eight skin lesion classes on the ISIC2019 dataset. These results demonstrate the model's potential as a diagnostic support tool for clinicians and a self assessment aid for patients.

Abstract: Most colorization models condition only on a single reference, typically the first frame of the scene. However, this approach ignores other sources of conditional data, such as character sheets, background images, or arbitrary colorized frames. We propose TimeColor, a sketch-based video colorization model that supports heterogeneous, variable-count references with the use of explicit per-reference region assignment. TimeColor encodes references as additional latent frames which are concatenated temporally, permitting them to be processed concurrently in each diffusion step while keeping the model's parameter count fixed. TimeColor also uses spatiotemporal correspondence-masked attention to enforce subject-reference binding in addition to modality-disjoint RoPE indexing. These mechanisms mitigate shortcutting and cross-identity palette leakage. Experiments on SAKUGA-42M under both single- and multi-reference protocols show that TimeColor improves color fidelity, identity consistency, and temporal stability over prior baselines.

Abstract: Person re-identification (ReID) is an extremely important area in both surveillance and mobile applications, requiring strong accuracy with minimal computational cost. State-of-the-art methods give good accuracy but with high computational budgets. To remedy this, this paper proposes VisNet, a computationally efficient and effective re-identification model suitable for real-world scenarios. It is the culmination of conceptual contributions, including feature fusion at multiple scales with automatic attention on each, semantic clustering with anatomical body partitioning, a dynamic weight averaging technique to balance classification semantic regularization, and the use of loss function FIDI for improved metric learning tasks. The multiple scales fuse ResNet50's stages 1 through 4 without the use of parallel paths, with semantic clustering introducing spatial constraints through the use of rule-based pseudo-labeling. VisNet achieves 87.05% Rank-1 and 77.65% mAP on the Market-1501 dataset, having 32.41M parameters and 4.601 GFLOPs, hence, proposing a practical approach for real-time deployment in surveillance and mobile applications where computational resources are limited.

Conclusion: OmniVaT框架首次成功解决了视觉触觉学习中的单领域泛化问题，通过统一嵌入-频率空间映射和层次化树结构表示，有效缓解了模态差异和领域差距，为多模态感知系统的实际部署提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual-tactile learning (VTL) enables embodied agents to perceive the physical world by integrating visual (VIS) and tactile (TAC) sensors. However, VTL still suffers from modality discrepancies between VIS and TAC images, as well as domain gaps caused by non-standardized tactile sensors and inconsistent data collection procedures. We formulate these challenges as a new task, termed single domain generalization for multimodal VTL (SDG-VTL). In this paper, we propose an OmniVaT framework that, for the first time, successfully addresses this task. On the one hand, OmniVaT integrates a multimodal fractional Fourier adapter (MFFA) to map VIS and TAC embeddings into a unified embedding-frequency space, thereby effectively mitigating the modality gap without multi-domain training data or careful cross-modal fusion strategies. On the other hand, it also incorporates a discrete tree generation (DTG) module that obtains diverse and reliable multimodal fractional representations through a hierarchical tree structure, thereby enhancing its adaptivity to fluctuating domain shifts in unseen domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior cross-domain generalization performance of OmniVaT on the SDG-VTL task.

Motivation: 在家庭环境中，机器人需要全面理解周围环境，以便与未经训练的人类进行有效和直观的互动。当前基于固定预定义类别的传统语义分割方法缺乏灵活性，限制了机器人的应用范围。

Method: 提出DVEFormer，一种基于知识蒸馏的高效RGB-D Transformer方法。该方法使用Alpha-CLIP的教师嵌入来指导学生模型学习细粒度的像素级嵌入，而不是直接进行传统的固定类别语义分割。支持线性探测实现语义分割，同时支持基于文本的查询等多种应用。

Result: 在常见室内数据集上的评估表明，该方法在满足实时要求的同时实现了有竞争力的性能。完整模型在NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin上达到26.3 FPS，较小变体达到77.0 FPS。定性结果显示了在实际应用中的有效性和可能用途。

Conclusion: 该方法可作为传统分割方法的直接替代方案，同时支持灵活的基于自然语言的查询，并能无缝集成到移动机器人的3D建图流程中，为机器人在家庭环境中的交互提供了更灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: In domestic environments, robots require a comprehensive understanding of their surroundings to interact effectively and intuitively with untrained humans. In this paper, we propose DVEFormer - an efficient RGB-D Transformer-based approach that predicts dense text-aligned visual embeddings (DVE) via knowledge distillation. Instead of directly performing classical semantic segmentation with fixed predefined classes, our method uses teacher embeddings from Alpha-CLIP to guide our efficient student model DVEFormer in learning fine-grained pixel-wise embeddings. While this approach still enables classical semantic segmentation, e.g., via linear probing, it further enables flexible text-based querying and other applications, such as creating comprehensive 3D maps. Evaluations on common indoor datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance while meeting real-time requirements, operating at 26.3 FPS for the full model and 77.0 FPS for a smaller variant on an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin. Additionally, we show qualitative results that highlight the effectiveness and possible use cases in real-world applications. Overall, our method serves as a drop-in replacement for traditional segmentation approaches while enabling flexible natural-language querying and seamless integration into 3D mapping pipelines for mobile robotics.

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition (HAR) has achieved remarkable progress with graph-based architectures. However, most existing methods remain body-centric, focusing on large-scale motions while neglecting subtle hand articulations that are crucial for fine-grained recognition. This work presents a probabilistic dual-stream framework that unifies reliability modeling and multi-modal integration, generalizing expertized learning under uncertainty across both intra-skeleton and cross-modal domains. The framework comprises three key components: (1) a calibration-free preprocessing pipeline that removes canonical-space transformations and learns directly from native coordinates; (2) a probabilistic Noisy-OR fusion that stabilizes reliability-aware dual-stream learning without requiring explicit confidence supervision; and (3) an intra- to cross-modal ensemble that couples four skeleton modalities (Joint, Bone, Joint Motion, and Bone Motion) to RGB representations, bridging structural and visual motion cues in a unified cross-modal formulation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks (NTU RGB+D~60/120, PKU-MMD, N-UCLA) and a newly defined hand-centric benchmark exhibit consistent improvements and robustness under noisy and heterogeneous conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose NeoVerse, a versatile 4D world model that is capable of 4D reconstruction, novel-trajectory video generation, and rich downstream applications. We first identify a common limitation of scalability in current 4D world modeling methods, caused either by expensive and specialized multi-view 4D data or by cumbersome training pre-processing. In contrast, our NeoVerse is built upon a core philosophy that makes the full pipeline scalable to diverse in-the-wild monocular videos. Specifically, NeoVerse features pose-free feed-forward 4D reconstruction, online monocular degradation pattern simulation, and other well-aligned techniques. These designs empower NeoVerse with versatility and generalization to various domains. Meanwhile, NeoVerse achieves state-of-the-art performance in standard reconstruction and generation benchmarks.

Abstract: Roadside litter poses environmental, safety and economic challenges, yet current monitoring relies on labour-intensive surveys and public reporting, providing limited spatial coverage. Existing vision datasets for litter detection focus on street-level still images, aerial scenes or aquatic environments, and do not reflect the unique characteristics of dashcam footage, where litter appears extremely small, sparse and embedded in cluttered road-verge backgrounds. We introduce RoLID-11K, the first large-scale dataset for roadside litter detection from dashcams, comprising over 11k annotated images spanning diverse UK driving conditions and exhibiting pronounced long-tail and small-object distributions. We benchmark a broad spectrum of modern detectors, from accuracy-oriented transformer architectures to real-time YOLO models, and analyse their strengths and limitations on this challenging task. Our results show that while CO-DETR and related transformers achieve the best localisation accuracy, real-time models remain constrained by coarse feature hierarchies. RoLID-11K establishes a challenging benchmark for extreme small-object detection in dynamic driving scenes and aims to support the development of scalable, low-cost systems for roadside-litter monitoring. The dataset is available at https://github.com/xq141839/RoLID-11K.

Abstract: Functional connectivity (FC) analysis, a valuable tool for computer-aided brain disorder diagnosis, traditionally relies on atlas-based parcellation. However, issues relating to selection bias and a lack of regard for subject specificity can arise as a result of such parcellations. Addressing this, we propose ABFR-KAN, a transformer-based classification network that incorporates novel advanced brain function representation components with the power of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to mitigate structural bias, improve anatomical conformity, and enhance the reliability of FC estimation. Extensive experiments on the ABIDE I dataset, including cross-site evaluation and ablation studies across varying model backbones and KAN configurations, demonstrate that ABFR-KAN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines for autism spectrum distorder (ASD) classification.

Abstract: In recent years, the advancement of AI technologies has accelerated the development of smart factories. In particular, the automatic monitoring of product assembly progress is crucial for improving operational efficiency, minimizing the cost of discarded parts, and maximizing factory productivity. However, in cases where assembly tasks are performed manually over multiple days, implementing smart factory systems remains a challenge. Previous work has proposed Anomaly Triplet-Net, which estimates assembly progress by applying deep metric learning to the visual features of products. Nevertheless, when visual changes between consecutive tasks are subtle, misclassification often occurs. To address this issue, this paper proposes a robust system for estimating assembly progress, even in cases of occlusion or minimal visual change, using a small-scale dataset. Our method leverages a Quadruplet Loss-based learning approach for anomaly images and introduces a custom data loader that strategically selects training samples to enhance estimation accuracy. We evaluated our approach using a image datasets: captured during desktop PC assembly. The proposed Anomaly Quadruplet-Net outperformed existing methods on the dataset. Specifically, it improved the estimation accuracy by 1.3% and reduced misclassification between adjacent tasks by 1.9% in the desktop PC dataset and demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: We introduce CPPO, a Contrastive Perception Policy Optimization method for finetuning vision-language models (VLMs). While reinforcement learning (RL) has advanced reasoning in language models, extending it to multimodal reasoning requires improving both the perception and reasoning aspects. Prior works tackle this challenge mainly with explicit perception rewards, but disentangling perception tokens from reasoning tokens is difficult, requiring extra LLMs, ground-truth data, forced separation of perception from reasoning by policy model, or applying rewards indiscriminately to all output tokens. CPPO addresses this problem by detecting perception tokens via entropy shifts in the model outputs under perturbed input images. CPPO then extends the RL objective function with a Contrastive Perception Loss (CPL) that enforces consistency under information-preserving perturbations and sensitivity under information-removing ones. Experiments show that CPPO surpasses previous perception-rewarding methods, while avoiding extra models, making training more efficient and scalable.

Conclusion: MotionPhysics能够通过自然语言提示直接生成视觉逼真的动态模拟，无需真实轨迹或视频标注支持，为广泛材料类型的物理参数推断提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Accurately simulating existing 3D objects and a wide variety of materials often demands expert knowledge and time-consuming physical parameter tuning to achieve the desired dynamic behavior. We introduce MotionPhysics, an end-to-end differentiable framework that infers plausible physical parameters from a user-provided natural language prompt for a chosen 3D scene of interest, removing the need for guidance from ground-truth trajectories or annotated videos. Our approach first utilizes a multimodal large language model to estimate material parameter values, which are constrained to lie within plausible ranges. We further propose a learnable motion distillation loss that extracts robust motion priors from pretrained video diffusion models while minimizing appearance and geometry inductive biases to guide the simulation. We evaluate MotionPhysics across more than thirty scenarios, including real-world, human-designed, and AI-generated 3D objects, spanning a wide range of materials such as elastic solids, metals, foams, sand, and both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids. We demonstrate that MotionPhysics produces visually realistic dynamic simulations guided by natural language, surpassing the state of the art while automatically determining physically plausible parameters.

Abstract: All-in-one image restoration aims to recover clean images from diverse unknown degradations using a single model. But extending this task to videos faces unique challenges. Existing approaches primarily focus on frame-wise degradation variation, overlooking the temporal continuity that naturally exists in real-world degradation processes. In practice, degradation types and intensities evolve smoothly over time, and multiple degradations may coexist or transition gradually. In this paper, we introduce the Smoothly Evolving Unknown Degradations (SEUD) scenario, where both the active degradation set and degradation intensity change continuously over time. To support this scenario, we design a flexible synthesis pipeline that generates temporally coherent videos with single, compound, and evolving degradations. To address the challenges in the SEUD scenario, we propose an all-in-One Recurrent Conditional and Adaptive prompting Network (ORCANet). First, a Coarse Intensity Estimation Dehazing (CIED) module estimates haze intensity using physical priors and provides coarse dehazed features as initialization. Second, a Flow Prompt Generation (FPG) module extracts degradation features. FPG generates both static prompts that capture segment-level degradation types and dynamic prompts that adapt to frame-level intensity variations. Furthermore, a label-aware supervision mechanism improves the discriminability of static prompt representations under different degradations. Extensive experiments show that ORCANet achieves superior restoration quality, temporal consistency, and robustness over image and video-based baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeText是一个无需训练、即插即用的框架，通过利用DiT模型的内在机制来改进文本渲染问题，主要解决'在何处书写'和'书写什么内容'两个关键问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型在处理精确文本渲染（尤其是多行布局、密集排版和长尾脚本如中文）时表现不佳，而现有解决方案通常需要昂贵的重新训练或严格的外部布局约束，这会降低美观性和限制灵活性。

Method: 1. '在何处书写'通过从图像到文本注意力机制中读取token级别的空间归因来定位书写区域，使用sink-like token作为稳定空间锚点，并通过拓扑感知优化生成高置信度掩码。2. '书写什么内容'引入频谱调制字形注入（SGMI），通过频域带通调制注入噪声对齐的字形先验，增强字形结构并抑制语义泄露。

Result: 在Qwen-Image、FLUX.1-dev和SD3变体上，在longText-Benchmark、CVTG和CLT-Bench等评测集上实验表明，在保持语义对齐和美学质量的同时，文本可读性得到了一致提升，且推理开销适中。

Conclusion: FreeText框架无需训练即可显著提升文本渲染质量，解决了现有方法在精确文本渲染方面的局限性，为文本到图像生成提供了更灵活有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models excel at open-domain synthesis but still struggle with precise text rendering, especially for multi-line layouts, dense typography, and long-tailed scripts such as Chinese. Prior solutions typically require costly retraining or rigid external layout constraints, which can degrade aesthetics and limit flexibility. We propose \textbf{FreeText}, a training-free, plug-and-play framework that improves text rendering by exploiting intrinsic mechanisms of \emph{Diffusion Transformer (DiT)} models. \textbf{FreeText} decomposes the problem into \emph{where to write} and \emph{what to write}. For \emph{where to write}, we localize writing regions by reading token-wise spatial attribution from endogenous image-to-text attention, using sink-like tokens as stable spatial anchors and topology-aware refinement to produce high-confidence masks. For \emph{what to write}, we introduce Spectral-Modulated Glyph Injection (SGMI), which injects a noise-aligned glyph prior with frequency-domain band-pass modulation to strengthen glyph structure and suppress semantic leakage (rendering the concept instead of the word). Extensive experiments on Qwen-Image, FLUX.1-dev, and SD3 variants across longText-Benchmark, CVTG, and our CLT-Bench show consistent gains in text readability while largely preserving semantic alignment and aesthetic quality, with modest inference overhead.

Motivation: Segment Anything Model在视觉非显著性场景表现不佳，需要提升其在低对比度场景下的分割精度

Method: 提出VNS-SAM，包含Mask-Edge Token Interactive解码器和Non-Salient Feature Mining模块，利用SAM的低层特征增强非显著性特征学习

Result: 在VNS-SEG数据集上验证了优异性能，特别是零样本设置下表现突出，参数增量小而训练快速

Conclusion: VNS-SAM有效提升了SAM在视觉非显著性场景的分割能力，保持了原有的零样本泛化性，具有广泛实际应用潜力

Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM), known for its remarkable zero-shot segmentation capabilities, has garnered significant attention in the community. Nevertheless, its performance is challenged when dealing with what we refer to as visually non-salient scenarios, where there is low contrast between the foreground and background. In these cases, existing methods often cannot capture accurate contours and fail to produce promising segmentation results. In this paper, we propose Visually Non-Salient SAM (VNS-SAM), aiming to enhance SAM's perception of visually non-salient scenarios while preserving its original zero-shot generalizability. We achieve this by effectively exploiting SAM's low-level features through two designs: Mask-Edge Token Interactive decoder and Non-Salient Feature Mining module. These designs help the SAM decoder gain a deeper understanding of non-salient characteristics with only marginal parameter increments and computational requirements. The additional parameters of VNS-SAM can be optimized within 4 hours, demonstrating its feasibility and practicality. In terms of data, we established VNS-SEG, a unified dataset for various VNS scenarios, with more than 35K images, in contrast to previous single-task adaptations. It is designed to make the model learn more robust VNS features and comprehensively benchmark the model's segmentation performance and generalizability on VNS scenarios. Extensive experiments across various VNS segmentation tasks demonstrate the superior performance of VNS-SAM, particularly under zero-shot settings, highlighting its potential for broad real-world applications.

Abstract: To achieve pixel-level image manipulation, drag-style image editing which edits images using points or trajectories as conditions is attracting widespread attention. Most previous methods follow move-and-track framework, in which miss tracking and ambiguous tracking are unavoidable challenging issues. Other methods under different frameworks suffer from various problems like the huge gap between source image and target edited image as well as unreasonable intermediate point which can lead to low editability. To avoid these problems, we propose DynaDrag, the first dragging method under predict-and-move framework. In DynaDrag, Motion Prediction and Motion Supervision are performed iteratively. In each iteration, Motion Prediction first predicts where the handle points should move, and then Motion Supervision drags them accordingly. We also propose to dynamically adjust the valid handle points to further improve the performance. Experiments on face and human datasets showcase the superiority over previous works.

Abstract: High-quality three-dimensional (3D) photoacoustic imaging (PAI) is gaining increasing attention in clinical applications. To address the challenges of limited space and high costs, irregular geometric transducer arrays that conform to specific imaging regions are promising for achieving high-quality 3D PAI with fewer transducers. However, traditional iterative reconstruction algorithms struggle with irregular array configurations, suffering from high computational complexity, substantial memory requirements, and lengthy reconstruction times. In this work, we introduce SlingBAG Pro, an advanced reconstruction algorithm based on the point cloud iteration concept of the Sliding ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) method, while extending its compatibility to arbitrary array geometries. SlingBAG Pro maintains high reconstruction quality, reduces the number of required transducers, and employs a hierarchical optimization strategy that combines zero-gradient filtering with progressively increased temporal sampling rates during iteration. This strategy rapidly removes redundant spatial point clouds, accelerates convergence, and significantly shortens overall reconstruction time. Compared to the original SlingBAG algorithm, SlingBAG Pro achieves up to a 2.2-fold speed improvement in point cloud-based 3D PA reconstruction under irregular array geometries. The proposed method is validated through both simulation and in vivo mouse experiments, and the source code is publicly available at https://github.com/JaegerCQ/SlingBAG_Pro.

Abstract: Multimodal generative AI systems like Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, and MidJourney have fundamentally changed how synthetic images are created. These tools drive innovation but also enable the spread of misleading content, false information, and manipulated media. As generated images become harder to distinguish from photographs, detecting them has become an urgent priority. To combat this challenge, We release MS COCOAI, a novel dataset for AI generated image detection consisting of 96000 real and synthetic datapoints, built using the MS COCO dataset. To generate synthetic images, we use five generators: Stable Diffusion 3, Stable Diffusion 2.1, SDXL, DALL-E 3, and MidJourney v6. Based on the dataset, we propose two tasks: (1) classifying images as real or generated, and (2) identifying which model produced a given synthetic image.

Abstract: The capability of Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) to apply world knowledge across diverse tasks remains a critical, unresolved challenge. Existing benchmarks fall short, offering only siloed, single-task evaluations with limited diagnostic power. To bridge this gap, we propose AEGIS (\emph{i.e.}, \textbf{A}ssessing \textbf{E}diting, \textbf{G}eneration, \textbf{I}nterpretation-Understanding for \textbf{S}uper-intelligence), a comprehensive multi-task benchmark covering visual understanding, generation, editing, and interleaved generation. AEGIS comprises 1,050 challenging, manually-annotated questions spanning 21 topics (including STEM, humanities, daily life, etc.) and 6 reasoning types. To concretely evaluate the performance of UMMs in world knowledge scope without ambiguous metrics, we further propose Deterministic Checklist-based Evaluation (DCE), a protocol that replaces ambiguous prompt-based scoring with atomic ``Y/N'' judgments, to enhance evaluation reliability. Our extensive experiments reveal that most UMMs exhibit severe world knowledge deficits and that performance degrades significantly with complex reasoning. Additionally, simple plug-in reasoning modules can partially mitigate these vulnerabilities, highlighting a promising direction for future research. These results highlight the importance of world-knowledge-based reasoning as a critical frontier for UMMs.

Motivation: 零样本视频时刻检索任务中，文本查询和视频内容之间存在语义粒度不匹配的问题。虽然现有研究尝试利用预训练知识实现模态对齐，但未能平衡不同模态在特定场景下的语义粒度表示，导致检索不准确

Method: 提出了GranAlign框架，包含两种互补技术：1）基于粒度的查询重写，生成多层次的语义粒度；2）查询感知的标题生成，将查询意图嵌入视频内容。通过将多级查询与查询无关和查询感知的标题配对，有效解决语义不匹配

Result: 在三个主要基准数据集（QVHighlights、Charades-STA、ActivityNet-Captions）上均取得了新的最先进性能，特别是在具有挑战性的QVHighlights数据集上实现了3.23%的mAP@avg显著提升

Conclusion: GranAlign框架有效解决了零样本视频时刻检索中的语义粒度不匹配问题，实现了更好的模态对齐，并且作为无训练的方法具有实用价值

Abstract: Zero-shot video moment retrieval (ZVMR) is the task of localizing a temporal moment within an untrimmed video using a natural language query without relying on task-specific training data. The primary challenge in this setting lies in the mismatch in semantic granularity between textual queries and visual content. Previous studies in ZVMR have attempted to achieve alignment by leveraging high-quality pre-trained knowledge that represents video and language in a joint space. However, these approaches failed to balance the semantic granularity between the pre-trained knowledge provided by each modality for a given scene. As a result, despite the high quality of each modality's representations, the mismatch in granularity led to inaccurate retrieval. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework, called Granularity-Aware Alignment (GranAlign), that bridges this gap between coarse and fine semantic representations. Our approach introduces two complementary techniques: granularity-based query rewriting to generate varied semantic granularities, and query-aware caption generation to embed query intent into video content. By pairing multi-level queries with both query-agnostic and query-aware captions, we effectively resolve semantic mismatches. As a result, our method sets a new state-of-the-art across all three major benchmarks (QVHighlights, Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Captions), with a notable 3.23% mAP@avg improvement on the challenging QVHighlights dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前基于离散VQ-VAE码本的替换技术解决文本到动作生成中安全问题时存在两个缺陷：1）因替换可复用的码本条目导致良性任务的性能降低；2）离散标记引入量化和平滑性损失，生成结果存在伪影和过渡不自然。此外，现有数据集中天然包含了不安全内容和动作，不适用于安全性导向的机器学习。

Method: 提出了SafeMo框架，通过最小化动作遗忘（MMU）策略：一种两阶段的机器学习遗忘技术，在连续空间中生成安全的人体动作，无需依赖离散码本；同时还创建了一个名为SafeMoVAE-29K的安全文本到动作数据集，包含经过改写后的安全文本提示和精修的动作数据。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在HumanML3D和Motion-X数据集上的遗忘集FID分别达到现有最强方法LCR的2.5倍和14.4倍，表明其遗忘效果显著；而对于良性安全提示的性能则相当或更好，生成了具有自然过渡的安全的人体动作。

Conclusion: SafeMo框架能够有效地生成安全的人体动作，在连续运动学空间中保留了自然的过渡特性，同时实现了安全性与生成效果的良好平衡，为解决文本到动作中存在的安全问题提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-motion (T2M) generation with diffusion backbones achieves strong realism and alignment. Safety concerns in T2M methods have been raised in recent years; existing methods replace discrete VQ-VAE codebook entries to steer the model away from unsafe behaviors. However, discrete codebook replacement-based methods have two critical flaws: firstly, replacing codebook entries which are reused by benign prompts leads to drifts on everyday tasks, degrading the model's benign performance; secondly, discrete token-based methods introduce quantization and smoothness loss, resulting in artifacts and jerky transitions. Moreover, existing text-to-motion datasets naturally contain unsafe intents and corresponding motions, making them unsuitable for safety-driven machine learning. To address these challenges, we propose SafeMo, a trustworthy motion generative framework integrating Minimal Motion Unlearning (MMU), a two-stage machine unlearning strategy, enabling safe human motion generation in continuous space, preserving continuous kinematics without codebook loss and delivering strong safety-utility trade-offs compared to current baselines. Additionally, we present the first safe text-to-motion dataset SafeMoVAE-29K integrating rewritten safe text prompts and continuous refined motion for trustworthy human motion unlearning. Built upon DiP, SafeMo efficiently generates safe human motions with natural transitions. Experiments demonstrate effective unlearning performance of SafeMo by showing strengthened forgetting on unsafe prompts, reaching 2.5x and 14.4x higher forget-set FID on HumanML3D and Motion-X respectively, compared to the previous SOTA human motion unlearning method LCR, with benign performance on safe prompts being better or comparable.

Abstract: RGB-Infrared (RGB-IR) multimodal perception is fundamental to embodied multimedia systems operating in complex physical environments. Although recent cross-modal fusion methods have advanced RGB-IR detection, the optimization dynamics caused by asymmetric modality characteristics remain underexplored. In practice, disparities in information density and feature quality introduce persistent optimization bias, leading training to overemphasize a dominant modality and hindering effective fusion. To quantify this phenomenon, we propose the Modality Dominance Index (MDI), which measures modality dominance by jointly modeling feature entropy and gradient contribution. Based on MDI, we develop a Modality Dominance-Aware Cross-modal Learning (MDACL) framework that regulates cross-modal optimization. MDACL incorporates Hierarchical Cross-modal Guidance (HCG) to enhance feature alignment and Adversarial Equilibrium Regularization (AER) to balance optimization dynamics during fusion. Extensive experiments on three RGB-IR benchmarks demonstrate that MDACL effectively mitigates optimization bias and achieves SOTA performance.

Motivation: 尽管通用目标检测技术已有显著进展，但小目标与正常尺度目标的性能差距依然存在。小目标对标注噪声高度敏感，追求严格定位目标可能导致噪声过拟合的问题需要解决。

Method: 提出TOLF框架：1）使用归一化流（normalizing flows）为小目标建模复杂的非高斯预测误差分布，实现灵活的错误建模；2）引入不确定性感知的梯度调制机制，抑制对高不确定性、易受噪声影响样本的学习，减轻过拟合并稳定训练。

Result: 在三个数据集上的广泛实验验证了方法的有效性。特别在AI-TOD数据集上，TOLF将DINO基线提升了1.2% AP。

Conclusion: TOLF通过流式误差建模和不确定性引导优化，有效提升了小目标检测在标注噪声存在下的鲁棒性和性能，显著缩小了小目标与正常尺度目标之间的检测性能差距。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in generic object detection, a persistent performance gap remains for tiny objects compared to normal-scale objects. We demonstrate that tiny objects are highly sensitive to annotation noise, where optimizing strict localization objectives risks noise overfitting. To address this, we propose Tiny Object Localization with Flows (TOLF), a noise-robust localization framework leveraging normalizing flows for flexible error modeling and uncertainty-guided optimization. Our method captures complex, non-Gaussian prediction distributions through flow-based error modeling, enabling robust learning under noisy supervision. An uncertainty-aware gradient modulation mechanism further suppresses learning from high-uncertainty, noise-prone samples, mitigating overfitting while stabilizing training. Extensive experiments across three datasets validate our approach's effectiveness. Especially, TOLF boosts the DINO baseline by 1.2% AP on the AI-TOD dataset.

The pipeline can help to monitor and correct patients'actions, thus aiding them in regaining muscle strength and motor functions. Secondly, we propose a fast tracking method for medical rehabilitation scenarios with multiple-person interference, which requires less than 1ms for tracking for a single frame. Additionally, we modify SmoothNet for real-time posture estimation, effectively reducing pose estimation errors and restoring the patient's true motion state, making it visually smoother. Finally, we use Unity platform for real-time monitoring and evaluation of patients' motion during rehabilitation, and to display the muscle stress conditions to assist patients with their rehabilitation training.

Abstract: Preoperative prognosis of Ependymoma is critical for treatment planning but challenging due to the lack of semantic insights in MRI compared to post-operative surgical reports. Existing multimodal methods fail to leverage this privileged text data when it is unavailable during inference. To bridge this gap, we propose HyperPriv-EPN, a hypergraph-based Learning Using Privileged Information (LUPI) framework. We introduce a Severed Graph Strategy, utilizing a shared encoder to process both a Teacher graph (enriched with privileged post-surgery information) and a Student graph (restricted to pre-operation data). Through dual-stream distillation, the Student learns to hallucinate semantic community structures from visual features alone. Validated on a multi-center cohort of 311 patients, HyperPriv-EPN achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and survival stratification. This effectively transfers expert knowledge to the preoperative setting, unlocking the value of historical post-operative data to guide the diagnosis of new patients without requiring text at inference.

Abstract: Image-based deep learning provides a non-invasive, scalable solution for monitoring potato quality during storage, addressing key challenges such as sprout detection, weight loss estimation, and shelf-life prediction. In this study, images and corresponding weight data were collected over a 200-day period under controlled temperature and humidity conditions. Leveraging powerful pre-trained architectures of ResNet, VGG, DenseNet, and Vision Transformer (ViT), we designed two specialized models: (1) a high-precision binary classifier for sprout detection, and (2) an advanced multi-class predictor to estimate weight loss and forecast remaining shelf-life with remarkable accuracy. DenseNet achieved exceptional performance, with 98.03% accuracy in sprout detection. Shelf-life prediction models performed best with coarse class divisions (2-5 classes), achieving over 89.83% accuracy, while accuracy declined for finer divisions (6-8 classes) due to subtle visual differences and limited data per class. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of integrating image-based models into automated sorting and inventory systems, enabling early identification of sprouted potatoes and dynamic categorization based on storage stage. Practical implications include improved inventory management, differential pricing strategies, and reduced food waste across supply chains. While predicting exact shelf-life intervals remains challenging, focusing on broader class divisions ensures robust performance. Future research should aim to develop generalized models trained on diverse potato varieties and storage conditions to enhance adaptability and scalability. Overall, this approach offers a cost-effective, non-destructive method for quality assessment, supporting efficiency and sustainability in potato storage and distribution.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models have demonstrated strong potential in medical image analysis and disease diagnosis. However, after deployment, their performance may deteriorate when the input data distribution shifts from that observed during development. Detecting such performance degradation is essential for clinical reliability, yet remains challenging for large pre-trained VLMs operating without labeled data. In this study, we investigate performance degradation detection under data shift in a state-of-the-art pathology VLM. We examine both input-level data shift and output-level prediction behavior to understand their respective roles in monitoring model reliability. To facilitate systematic analysis of input data shift, we develop DomainSAT, a lightweight toolbox with a graphical interface that integrates representative shift detection algorithms and enables intuitive exploration of data shift. Our analysis shows that while input data shift detection is effective at identifying distributional changes and providing early diagnostic signals, it does not always correspond to actual performance degradation. Motivated by this observation, we further study output-based monitoring and introduce a label-free, confidence-based degradation indicator that directly captures changes in model prediction confidence. We find that this indicator exhibits a close relationship with performance degradation and serves as an effective complement to input shift detection. Experiments on a large-scale pathology dataset for tumor classification demonstrate that combining input data shift detection and output confidence-based indicators enables more reliable detection and interpretation of performance degradation in VLMs under data shift. These findings provide a practical and complementary framework for monitoring the reliability of foundation models in digital pathology.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在现实应用中存在生成幻觉内容的问题，现有免训练方法存在两个局限性：对幻觉来源假设过窄，且在生成后期效果下降，无法有效处理视觉信息传播到文本的问题。

Method: 提出选择性移除关键文本token构建幻觉模型，结合广义对比解码整合多个幻觉模型来代表不同的幻觉来源。

Result: 在CHAIR指标上提升20%，在六个基准测试和三个LVLM家族上均获得稳定改进，性能优于最先进的免训练方法。

Conclusion: CRoPS框架有效缓解了大型视觉语言模型的幻觉问题，通过创新的幻觉模型构建和广义对比解码方法，显著提升了模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Despite the rapid success of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), a persistent challenge is their tendency to generate hallucinated content, undermining reliability in real-world use. Existing training-free methods address hallucinations but face two limitations: (i) they rely on narrow assumptions about hallucination sources, and (ii) their effectiveness declines toward the end of generation, where hallucinations are most likely to occur. A common strategy is to build hallucinated models by completely or partially removing visual tokens and contrasting them with the original model. Yet, this alone proves insufficient, since visual information still propagates into generated text. Building on this insight, we propose a novel hallucinated model that captures hallucination effects by selectively removing key text tokens. We further introduce Generalized Contrastive Decoding, which integrates multiple hallucinated models to represent diverse hallucination sources. Together, these ideas form CRoPS, a training-free hallucination mitigation framework that improves CHAIR scores by 20% and achieves consistent gains across six benchmarks and three LVLM families, outperforming state-of-the-art training-free methods.

Abstract: Humans excel at forecasting the future dynamics of a scene given just a single image. Video generation models that can mimic this ability are an essential component for intelligent systems. Recent approaches have improved temporal coherence and 3D consistency in single-image-conditioned video generation. However, these methods often lack robust user controllability, such as modifying the camera path, limiting their applicability in real-world applications. Most existing camera-controlled image-to-video models struggle with accurately modeling camera motion, maintaining temporal consistency, and preserving geometric integrity. Leveraging explicit intermediate 3D representations offers a promising solution by enabling coherent video generation aligned with a given camera trajectory. Although these methods often use 3D point clouds to render scenes and introduce object motion in a later stage, this two-step process still falls short in achieving full temporal consistency, despite allowing precise control over camera movement. We propose a novel framework that constructs a 3D Gaussian scene representation and samples plausible object motion, given a single image in a single forward pass. This enables fast, camera-guided video generation without the need for iterative denoising to inject object motion into render frames. Extensive experiments on the KITTI, Waymo, RealEstate10K and DL3DV-10K datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art video quality and inference efficiency.

Abstract: In digital imaging, image demosaicing is a crucial first step which recovers the RGB information from a color filter array (CFA). Oftentimes, deep learning is utilized to perform image demosaicing. Given that most modern digital imaging applications occur on mobile platforms, applying deep learning to demosaicing requires lightweight and efficient networks. Isotropic networks, also known as residual-in-residual networks, have been often employed for image demosaicing and joint-demosaicing-and-denoising (JDD). Most demosaicing isotropic networks avoid spatial downsampling entirely, and thus are often prohibitively expensive computationally for mobile applications. Contrary to previous isotropic network designs, this paper claims that spatial downsampling to a signficant degree can improve the efficiency and performance of isotropic networks. To validate this claim, we design simple fully convolutional networks with and without downsampling using a mathematical architecture design technique adapted from DeepMAD, and find that downsampling improves empirical performance. Additionally, empirical testing of the downsampled variant, JD3Net, of our fully convolutional networks reveals strong empirical performance on a variety of image demosaicing and JDD tasks.

Motivation: GS-SLAM通过残差驱动逐步添加高斯点效率较低，RGS-SLAM旨在通过一次性初始化提升早期建图的稳定性和收敛速度。

Method: 使用DINOv3描述子和置信度感知内点分类器获取稠密多视角匹配，进行一次性三角化生成结构感知的高斯种子，再进行优化。

Result: 收敛速度提升约20%，在纹理丰富和杂乱场景中渲染质量更高，在TUM RGB-D和Replica数据集上定位和重建精度达到SOTA水平，实时性能达925 FPS。

Conclusion: RGS-SLAM提供了更稳定高效的高斯SLAM初始化方案，与现有管道完全兼容，显著提升收敛速度和重建质量。

Abstract: We introduce RGS-SLAM, a robust Gaussian-splatting SLAM framework that replaces the residual-driven densification stage of GS-SLAM with a training-free correspondence-to-Gaussian initialization. Instead of progressively adding Gaussians as residuals reveal missing geometry, RGS-SLAM performs a one-shot triangulation of dense multi-view correspondences derived from DINOv3 descriptors refined through a confidence-aware inlier classifier, generating a well-distributed and structure-aware Gaussian seed prior to optimization. This initialization stabilizes early mapping and accelerates convergence by roughly 20\%, yielding higher rendering fidelity in texture-rich and cluttered scenes while remaining fully compatible with existing GS-SLAM pipelines. Evaluated on the TUM RGB-D and Replica datasets, RGS-SLAM achieves competitive or superior localization and reconstruction accuracy compared with state-of-the-art Gaussian and point-based SLAM systems, sustaining real-time mapping performance at up to 925 FPS.

Result: 使用GPT-5.2和Gemini-3 Pro等先进后端，完整流程与讲师评分的平均绝对差异约为8分，偏差较低，在D_max=40时的手动审查触发率约为17%。消融研究表明简单的提示和移除参考答案会显著降低准确性并引入系统性过高评分。

Conclusion: 结构化提示和参考答案基础是实现自动评分的两个关键要素。该工作流程为手写STEM测验提供了一种可靠、可扩展的自动化评分方案。

Abstract: Handwritten STEM exams capture open-ended reasoning and diagrams, but manual grading is slow and difficult to scale. We present an end-to-end workflow for grading scanned handwritten engineering quizzes with multimodal large language models (LLMs) that preserves the standard exam process (A4 paper, unconstrained student handwriting). The lecturer provides only a handwritten reference solution (100%) and a short set of grading rules; the reference is converted into a text-only summary that conditions grading without exposing the reference scan. Reliability is achieved through a multi-stage design with a format/presence check to prevent grading blank answers, an ensemble of independent graders, supervisor aggregation, and rigid templates with deterministic validation to produce auditable, machine-parseable reports. We evaluate the frozen pipeline in a clean-room protocol on a held-out real course quiz in Slovenian, including hand-drawn circuit schematics. With state-of-the-art backends (GPT-5.2 and Gemini-3 Pro), the full pipeline achieves $\approx$8-point mean absolute difference to lecturer grades with low bias and an estimated manual-review trigger rate of $\approx$17% at $D_{\max}=40$. Ablations show that trivial prompting and removing the reference solution substantially degrade accuracy and introduce systematic over-grading, confirming that structured prompting and reference grounding are essential.

Our findings reveal that fusing the feature representation from self-supervised auxiliary tasks is a powerful feature representation for the problem at hand. Such a representation can leverage the ultimate potential and bring in a unique representation of both the self-supervised and primary tasks, achieving better performance for the primary task. We experimented on a large set of datasets, which includes DF40, FaceForensics++, Celeb-DF, DFD, FaceShifter, UADFV, and our results showed better generalizability on cross-dataset evaluation when compared with current state-of-the-art detectors.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Left ventricle (LV) segmentation is critical for clinical quantification and diagnosis of cardiac images. In this work, we propose two novel deep learning architectures called LNU-Net and IBU-Net for left ventricle segmentation from short-axis cine MRI images. LNU-Net is derived from layer normalization (LN) U-Net architecture, while IBU-Net is derived from the instance-batch normalized (IB) U-Net for medical image segmentation. The architectures of LNU-Net and IBU-Net have a down-sampling path for feature extraction and an up-sampling path for precise localization. We use the original U-Net as the basic segmentation approach and compared it with our proposed architectures. Both LNU-Net and IBU-Net have left ventricle segmentation methods: LNU-Net applies layer normalization in each convolutional block, while IBU-Net incorporates instance and batch normalization together in the first convolutional block and passes its result to the next layer. Our method incorporates affine transformations and elastic deformations for image data processing. Our dataset that contains 805 MRI images regarding the left ventricle from 45 patients is used for evaluation. We experimentally evaluate the results of the proposed approaches outperforming the dice coefficient and the average perpendicular distance than other state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: AdaGaR通过统一的频率自适应和时间连续性框架，显著提升动态3D场景重建质量，为多项下游任务提供有效解决方案

Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic 3D scenes from monocular videos requires simultaneously capturing high-frequency appearance details and temporally continuous motion. Existing methods using single Gaussian primitives are limited by their low-pass filtering nature, while standard Gabor functions introduce energy instability. Moreover, lack of temporal continuity constraints often leads to motion artifacts during interpolation. We propose AdaGaR, a unified framework addressing both frequency adaptivity and temporal continuity in explicit dynamic scene modeling. We introduce Adaptive Gabor Representation, extending Gaussians through learnable frequency weights and adaptive energy compensation to balance detail capture and stability. For temporal continuity, we employ Cubic Hermite Splines with Temporal Curvature Regularization to ensure smooth motion evolution. An Adaptive Initialization mechanism combining depth estimation, point tracking, and foreground masks establishes stable point cloud distributions in early training. Experiments on Tap-Vid DAVIS demonstrate state-of-the-art performance (PSNR 35.49, SSIM 0.9433, LPIPS 0.0723) and strong generalization across frame interpolation, depth consistency, video editing, and stereo view synthesis.

Abstract: Machine learning offers potential solutions to current issues in industrial systems in areas such as quality control and predictive maintenance, but also faces unique barriers in industrial applications. An ongoing challenge is extreme class imbalance, primarily due to the limited availability of faulty data during training. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of anomaly detection algorithms using a problem-agnostic simulated dataset that reflects real-world engineering constraints. Using a synthetic dataset with a hyper-spherical based anomaly distribution in 2D and 10D, we benchmark 14 detectors across training datasets with anomaly rates between 0.05% and 20% and training sizes between 1 000 and 10 000 (with a testing dataset size of 40 000) to assess performance and generalization error. Our findings reveal that the best detector is highly dependant on the total number of faulty examples in the training dataset, with additional healthy examples offering insignificant benefits in most cases. With less than 20 faulty examples, unsupervised methods (kNN/LOF) dominate; but around 30-50 faulty examples, semi-supervised (XGBOD) and supervised (SVM/CatBoost) detectors, we see large performance increases. While semi-supervised methods do not show significant benefits with only two features, the improvements are evident at ten features. The study highlights the performance drop on generalization of anomaly detection methods on smaller datasets, and provides practical insights for deploying anomaly detection in industrial environments.

Abstract: Yahtzee is a classic dice game with a stochastic, combinatorial structure and delayed rewards, making it an interesting mid-scale RL benchmark. While an optimal policy for solitaire Yahtzee can be computed using dynamic programming methods, multiplayer is intractable, motivating approximation methods. We formulate Yahtzee as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and train self-play agents using various policy gradient methods: REINFORCE, Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), all using a multi-headed network with a shared trunk. We ablate feature and action encodings, architecture, return estimators, and entropy regularization to understand their impact on learning. Under a fixed training budget, REINFORCE and PPO prove sensitive to hyperparameters and fail to reach near-optimal performance, whereas A2C trains robustly across a range of settings. Our agent attains a median score of 241.78 points over 100,000 evaluation games, within 5.0\% of the optimal DP score of 254.59, achieving the upper section bonus and Yahtzee at rates of 24.9\% and 34.1\%, respectively. All models struggle to learn the upper bonus strategy, overindexing on four-of-a-kind's, highlighting persistent long-horizon credit-assignment and exploration challenges.

Abstract: The open-weight LLM ecosystem is increasingly defined by model composition techniques (such as weight merging, speculative decoding, and vocabulary expansion) that remix capabilities from diverse sources. A critical prerequisite for applying these methods across different model families is tokenizer transplant, which aligns incompatible vocabularies to a shared embedding space. We demonstrate that this essential interoperability step introduces a supply-chain vulnerability: we engineer a single "breaker token" that is functionally inert in a donor model yet reliably reconstructs into a high-salience malicious feature after transplant into a base model. By exploiting the geometry of coefficient reuse, our attack creates an asymmetric realizability gap that sabotages the base model's generation while leaving the donor's utility statistically indistinguishable from nominal behavior. We formalize this as a dual-objective optimization problem and instantiate the attack using a sparse solver. Empirically, the attack is training-free and achieves spectral mimicry to evade outlier detection, while demonstrating structural persistence against fine-tuning and weight merging, highlighting a hidden risk in the pipeline of modular AI composition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的BAI算法在实用场景中表现不佳，因为严格的瞬时错误控制要求使用宽松的尾不等式或参数假设，导致样本效率低下。许多实际应用（如弱信号、高显著性要求、实验后推断）需要长实验时段，因此渐近有效性更为合适。

Method: 提出了渐近任意时间有效的置信序列（asymptotic anytime-valid confidence sequences）来构建臂指数的置信区间。基于此设计新的BAI算法，灵活整合协变量进行方差缩减，确保在完全非参数设置下的近似错误控制。在温和的收敛假设下，推导样本复杂度的渐近界。

Result: 所提方法的渐近样本复杂度界限证明，在最坏情况下的样本复杂度与高斯BAI在已知方差和严格错误保证下的最佳情况样本复杂度相匹配。实验表明，该方法在保持错误控制的同时显著降低了平均样本复杂度。

Conclusion: 该研究工作通过放松错误控制为渐近保证，使得在非参数、协变量丰富的设置中实现更优的样本效率成为可能，为实际BAI应用提供了更实用且理论坚实的解决方案。

Abstract: In fixed-confidence best arm identification (BAI), the objective is to quickly identify the optimal option while controlling the probability of error below a desired threshold. Despite the plethora of BAI algorithms, existing methods typically fall short in practical settings, as stringent exact error control requires using loose tail inequalities and/or parametric restrictions. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a relaxed formulation that requires valid error control asymptotically with respect to a minimum sample size. This aligns with many real-world settings that often involve weak signals, high desired significance, and post-experiment inference requirements, all of which necessitate long horizons. This allows us to achieve tighter optimality, while better handling flexible nonparametric outcome distributions and fully leveraging individual-level contexts. We develop a novel asymptotic anytime-valid confidence sequences over arm indices, and we use it to design a new BAI algorithm for our asymptotic framework. Our method flexibly incorporates covariates for variance reduction and ensures approximate error control in fully nonparametric settings. Under mild convergence assumptions, we provide asymptotic bounds on the sample complexity and show the worst-case sample complexity of our approach matches the best-case sample complexity of Gaussian BAI under exact error guarantees and known variances. Experiments suggest our approach reduces average sample complexities while maintaining error control.

Conclusion: 将提示工程重构为序列决策问题，通过自适应指令选择能有效解决大语言模型在方程发现中的指令脆弱性问题，提升模型性能和解的质量。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for equation discovery, yet their outputs are highly sensitive to prompt phrasing, a phenomenon we term instruction brittleness. Static prompts cannot adapt to the evolving state of a multi-step generation process, causing models to plateau at suboptimal solutions. To address this, we propose NeuroSymBO, which reframes prompt engineering as a sequential decision problem. Our method maintains a discrete library of reasoning strategies and uses Bayesian Optimization to select the optimal instruction at each step based on numerical feedback. Experiments on PDE discovery benchmarks show that adaptive instruction selection significantly outperforms fixed prompts, achieving higher recovery rates with more parsimonious solutions.

Abstract: We present GRL-SNAM, a geometric reinforcement learning framework for Simultaneous Navigation and Mapping(SNAM) in unknown environments. A SNAM problem is challenging as it needs to design hierarchical or joint policies of multiple agents that control the movement of a real-life robot towards the goal in mapless environment, i.e. an environment where the map of the environment is not available apriori, and needs to be acquired through sensors. The sensors are invoked from the path learner, i.e. navigator, through active query responses to sensory agents, and along the motion path. GRL-SNAM differs from preemptive navigation algorithms and other reinforcement learning methods by relying exclusively on local sensory observations without constructing a global map. Our approach formulates path navigation and mapping as a dynamic shortest path search and discovery process using controlled Hamiltonian optimization: sensory inputs are translated into local energy landscapes that encode reachability, obstacle barriers, and deformation constraints, while policies for sensing, planning, and reconfiguration evolve stagewise via updating Hamiltonians. A reduced Hamiltonian serves as an adaptive score function, updating kinetic/potential terms, embedding barrier constraints, and continuously refining trajectories as new local information arrives. We evaluate GRL-SNAM on two different 2D navigation tasks. Comparing against local reactive baselines and global policy learning references under identical stagewise sensing constraints, it preserves clearance, generalizes to unseen layouts, and demonstrates that Geometric RL learning via updating Hamiltonians enables high-quality navigation through minimal exploration via local energy refinement rather than extensive global mapping. The code is publicly available on \href{https://github.com/CVC-Lab/GRL-SNAM}{Github}.

Abstract: This paper tackles the pressing challenge of preserving semantic meaning in communication systems constrained by limited bandwidth. We introduce a novel reinforcement learning framework that achieves per-dimension unequal error protection via adaptive repetition coding. Central to our approach is a composite semantic distortion metric that balances global embedding similarity with entity-level preservation, empowering the reinforcement learning agent to allocate protection in a context-aware manner. Experiments show statistically significant gains over uniform protection, achieving 6.8% higher chrF scores and 9.3% better entity preservation at 1 dB SNR. The key innovation of our framework is the demonstration that simple, intelligently allocated repetition coding enables fine-grained semantic protection -- an advantage unattainable with conventional codes such as LDPC or Reed-Solomon. Our findings challenge traditional channel coding paradigms by establishing that code structure must align with semantic granularity. This approach is particularly suited to edge computing and IoT scenarios, where bandwidth is scarce, but semantic fidelity is critical, providing a practical pathway for next-generation semantic-aware networks.

Conclusion: 为非马尔可夫环境下的强化学习提供了收敛保证的理论框架，特别阐明了非马尔可夫过程与辅助马尔可夫过程之间的联系，并展示了在部分可观测场景中的实际应用。

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning methods with linear function approximation under non-Markov state and cost processes. We first consider the policy evaluation method and show that the algorithm converges under suitable ergodicity conditions on the underlying non-Markov processes. Furthermore, we show that the limit corresponds to the fixed point of a joint operator composed of an orthogonal projection and the Bellman operator of an auxiliary \emph{Markov} decision process.
  For Q-learning with linear function approximation, as in the Markov setting, convergence is not guaranteed in general. We show, however, that for the special case where the basis functions are chosen based on quantization maps, the convergence can be shown under similar ergodicity conditions. Finally, we apply our results to partially observed Markov decision processes, where finite-memory variables are used as state representations, and we derive explicit error bounds for the limits of the resulting learning algorithms.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 交通事故事故严重程度的准确预测对于交通安全管理和预防具有重要意义。然而，现有研究对各类环境、时空因素的具体预测能力了解有限，特别是在处理类别不平衡数据时的建模方法需要进一步探索。

Method: 使用2016-2023年美国50万起交通事故数据集，采用XGBoost分类器，通过随机搜索交叉验证进行优化，并使用类别权重调整处理类别不平衡问题。

Result: 最终模型整体准确率达到78%，对主要类别（严重程度2）的精确率和召回率达到87%。特征重要性分析显示，一天中的时间、地理位置以及能见度、温度和风速等天气相关变量是最强的预测因素。令人意外的是，降水和能见度显示有限的预测能力，反映了驾驶员在明显危险条件下的行为适应。

Conclusion: 研究发现时间、地理位置和天气变量是预测事故严重程度的关键因素。数据集以中等严重程度事故为主，限制了模型学习极端情况的能力，表明需要替代采样策略、增强特征工程和整合外部数据集。这些发现为基于证据的交通管理提供支持，并为严重程度预测研究的未来方向提供了建议。

Abstract: This study investigates the predictive capacity of environmental, temporal, and spatial factors on traffic accident severity in the United States. Using a dataset of 500,000 U.S. traffic accidents spanning 2016-2023, we trained an XGBoost classifier optimized through randomized search cross-validation and adjusted for class imbalance via class weighting. The final model achieves an overall accuracy of 78%, with strong performance on the majority class (Severity 2), attaining 87% precision and recall. Feature importance analysis reveals that time of day, geographic location, and weather-related variables, including visibility, temperature, and wind speed, rank among the strongest predictors of accident severity. However, contrary to initial hypotheses, precipitation and visibility demonstrate limited predictive power, potentially reflecting behavioral adaptation by drivers under overtly hazardous conditions. The dataset's predominance of mid-level severity accidents constrains the model's capacity to learn meaningful patterns for extreme cases, highlighting the need for alternative sampling strategies, enhanced feature engineering, and integration of external datasets. These findings contribute to evidence-based traffic management and suggest future directions for severity prediction research.

Abstract: While federated learning (FL) enables fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) without compromising data privacy, the substantial size of an LLM renders on-device training impractical for resource-constrained clients, such as mobile devices. Thus, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have emerged as a computation-efficient solution, which activates only a sparse subset of experts during model training to reduce computing burden without sacrificing performance. Though integrating MoE into FL fine-tuning holds significant potential, it still encounters three key challenges: i) selecting appropriate experts for clients remains challenging due to the lack of a reliable metric to measure each expert's impact on local fine-tuning performance, ii) the heterogeneous computing resources across clients severely hinder MoE-based LLM fine-tuning, as dynamic expert activations across diverse input samples can overwhelm resource-constrained devices, and iii) client-specific expert subsets and routing preference undermine global aggregation, where misaligned expert updates and inconsistent gating networks in troduce destructive interference. To address these challenges, we propose HFedMoE, a heterogeneous MoE-based FL fine-tuning framework that customizes a subset of experts to each client for computation-efficient LLM fine-tuning. Specifically, HFedMoE identifies the expert importance based on its contributions to fine-tuning performance, and then adaptively selects a subset of experts from an information bottleneck perspective to align with each client' s computing budget. A sparsity-aware model aggregation strategy is also designed to aggregate the actively fine-tuned experts and gating parameters with importance weighted contributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HFedMoE outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in training accuracy and convergence speed.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多机器人系统和多智能体系统中，异构智能体在相似但不完全相同的环境下执行共同高层目标时，面临直接共享数据的挑战：不同环境的动态差异、隐私限制和有限通信带宽使得池化数据学习共享奖励函数不切实际。

Method: 每个客户端首先在本地执行轻量级最大熵逆强化学习，遵守计算和隐私限制。得到奖励函数后，通过考虑其底层几何结构的Wasserstein重心进行融合，构建全局奖励函数。

Result: 作者证明了这种重心融合方法比联邦学习中传统的参数平均方法能产生更准确的全局奖励估计。该方法提供了通信高效的异构智能体奖励共享框架。

Conclusion: 这项工作为异构智能体和环境提供了一种原则性的、通信高效的框架，用于推导可跨环境泛化的共享奖励函数。

Abstract: In robotics and multi-agent systems, fleets of autonomous agents often operate in subtly different environments while pursuing a common high-level objective. Directly pooling their data to learn a shared reward function is typically impractical due to differences in dynamics, privacy constraints, and limited communication bandwidth. This paper introduces an optimal transport-based approach to federated inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Each client first performs lightweight Maximum Entropy IRL locally, adhering to its computational and privacy limitations. The resulting reward functions are then fused via a Wasserstein barycenter, which considers their underlying geometric structure. We further prove that this barycentric fusion yields a more faithful global reward estimate than conventional parameter averaging methods in federated learning. Overall, this work provides a principled and communication-efficient framework for deriving a shared reward that generalizes across heterogeneous agents and environments.

Abstract: Decision Transformers (DTs) have emerged as a powerful framework for sequential decision making by formulating offline reinforcement learning (RL) as a sequence modeling problem. However, extending DTs to online settings with pure RL gradients remains largely unexplored, as existing approaches continue to rely heavily on supervised sequence-modeling objectives during online finetuning. We identify hindsight return relabeling -- a standard component in online DTs -- as a critical obstacle to RL-based finetuning: while beneficial for supervised learning, it is fundamentally incompatible with importance sampling-based RL algorithms such as GRPO, leading to unstable training. Building on this insight, we propose new algorithms that enable online finetuning of Decision Transformers using pure reinforcement learning gradients. We adapt GRPO to DTs and introduce several key modifications, including sub-trajectory optimization for improved credit assignment, sequence-level likelihood objectives for enhanced stability and efficiency, and active sampling to encourage exploration in uncertain regions. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our methods outperform existing online DT baselines and achieve new state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, highlighting the effectiveness of pure-RL-based online finetuning for Decision Transformers.

Abstract: Effective exploration remains a key challenge in RL, especially with non-stationary rewards or high-dimensional policies. We introduce ARISE, a lightweight framework that enhances reinforcement learning by augmenting standard policy-gradient methods with a compact swarm-based exploration layer. ARISE blends policy actions with particle-driven proposals, where each particle represents a candidate policy trajectory sampled in the action space, and modulates exploration adaptively using reward-variance cues. While easy benchmarks exhibit only slight improvements (e.g., +0.7% on CartPole-v1), ARISE yields substantial gains on more challenging tasks, including +46% on LunarLander-v3 and +22% on Hopper-v4, while preserving stability on Walker2d and Ant. Under non-stationary reward shifts, ARISE provides marked robustness advantages, outperforming PPO by +75 points on CartPole and improving LunarLander accordingly. Ablation studies confirm that both the swarm component and the adaptive mechanism contribute to the performance. Overall, ARISE offers a simple, architecture-agnostic route to more exploratory and resilient RL agents without altering core algorithmic structures.

Abstract: Off-policy actor-critic methods in reinforcement learning train a critic with temporal-difference updates and use it as a learning signal for the policy (actor). This design typically achieves higher sample efficiency than purely on-policy methods. However, critic networks tend to overestimate value estimates systematically. This is often addressed by introducing a pessimistic bias based on uncertainty estimates. Current methods employ ensembling to quantify the critic's epistemic uncertainty-uncertainty due to limited data and model ambiguity-to scale pessimistic updates. In this work, we propose a new algorithm called Stochastic Actor-Critic (STAC) that incorporates temporal (one-step) aleatoric uncertainty-uncertainty arising from stochastic transitions, rewards, and policy-induced variability in Bellman targets-to scale pessimistic bias in temporal-difference updates, rather than relying on epistemic uncertainty. STAC uses a single distributional critic network to model the temporal return uncertainty, and applies dropout to both the critic and actor networks for regularization. Our results show that pessimism based on a distributional critic alone suffices to mitigate overestimation, and naturally leads to risk-averse behavior in stochastic environments. Introducing dropout further improves training stability and performance by means of regularization. With this design, STAC achieves improved computational efficiency using a single distributional critic network.

Method: 回顾性队列研究，使用大型学术医疗系统的去标识化EHR数据。构建预测情景，利用观察窗口数据（人口统计学、诊断、实验室结果等）训练XGBoost模型，与FIB-4进行性能比较。

Result: ML模型在所有预测时间窗口（1年、2年、3年）均优于FIB-4。XGBoost模型的AUC分别为0.81、0.73、0.69，而FIB-4的AUC为0.71、0.63、0.57。

Conclusion: 基于常规EHR数据的ML模型能更早、更准确地预测肝硬化风险，可作为自动化决策支持工具整合到临床工作流中，实现主动预防和管理。

Abstract: Objective: Develop and evaluate machine learning (ML) models for predicting incident liver cirrhosis one, two, and three years prior to diagnosis using routinely collected electronic health record (EHR) data, and to benchmark their performance against the FIB-4 score. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using de-identified EHR data from a large academic health system. Patients with fatty liver disease were identified and categorized into cirrhosis and non-cirrhosis cohorts based on ICD-9/10 codes. Prediction scenarios were constructed using observation and prediction windows to emulate real-world clinical use. Demographics, diagnoses, laboratory results, vital signs, and comorbidity indices were aggregated from the observation window. XGBoost models were trained for 1-, 2-, and 3-year prediction horizons and evaluated on held-out test sets. Model performance was compared with FIB-4 using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: Final cohorts included 3,043 patients for the 1-year prediction, 1,981 for the 2-year prediction, and 1,470 for the 3-year prediction. Across all prediction windows, ML models consistently outperformed FIB-4. The XGBoost models achieved AUCs of 0.81, 0.73, and 0.69 for 1-, 2-, and 3-year predictions, respectively, compared with 0.71, 0.63, and 0.57 for FIB-4. Performance gains persisted with longer prediction horizons, indicating improved early risk discrimination. Conclusions: Machine learning models leveraging routine EHR data substantially outperform the traditional FIB-4 score for early prediction of liver cirrhosis. These models enable earlier and more accurate risk stratification and can be integrated into clinical workflows as automated decision-support tools to support proactive cirrhosis prevention and management.

Motivation: 心血管疾病尤其是心律失常是全球主要死因，需要IoMT持续监测，但现有深度学习方法计算开销过大，不适合资源受限的边缘设备。

Method: 采用数据导向框架，优先特征工程而非模型复杂度。整合时频小波分解和图论结构描述符（如PageRank中心性）使高维心律失常数据线性可分，再使用互信息和递归消除优化特征空间，最终采用可解释的极轻量线性分类器。

Conclusion: 该框架为电池供电的心脏传感器提供了高效的心律失常监测方案，通过优化的特征工程在边缘设备上实现了实时、高精度、低功耗的诊断系统。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases, particularly arrhythmias, remain a leading global cause of mortality, necessitating continuous monitoring via the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT). However, state-of-the-art deep learning approaches often impose prohibitive computational overheads, rendering them unsuitable for resource-constrained edge devices. This study proposes a resource-efficient, data-centric framework that prioritizes feature engineering over complexity. Our optimized pipeline makes the complex, high-dimensional arrhythmia data linearly separable. This is achieved by integrating time-frequency wavelet decompositions with graph-theoretic structural descriptors, such as PageRank centrality. This hybrid feature space, combining wavelet decompositions and graph-theoretic descriptors, is then refined using mutual information and recursive elimination, enabling interpretable, ultra-lightweight linear classifiers. Validation on the MIT-BIH and INCART datasets yields 98.44% diagnostic accuracy with an 8.54 KB model footprint. The system achieves 0.46 $μ$s classification inference latency within a 52 ms per-beat pipeline, ensuring real-time operation. These outcomes provide an order-of-magnitude efficiency gain over compressed models, such as KD-Light (25 KB, 96.32% accuracy), advancing battery-less cardiac sensors.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of photorealistic generative models has made it increasingly important to attribute the origin of synthetic content, moving beyond binary real or fake detection toward identifying the specific model that produced a given image. We study the problem of distinguishing outputs from a target generative model (e.g., OpenAI Dalle 3) from other sources, including real images and images generated by a wide range of alternative models. Using CLIP features and a simple linear classifier, shown to be effective in prior work, we establish a strong baseline for target generator attribution using only limited labeled data from the target model and a small number of known generators. However, this baseline struggles to generalize to harder, unseen, and newly released generators. To address this limitation, we propose a constrained optimization approach that leverages unlabeled wild data, consisting of images collected from the Internet that may include real images, outputs from unknown generators, or even samples from the target model itself. The proposed method encourages wild samples to be classified as non target while explicitly constraining performance on labeled data to remain high. Experimental results show that incorporating wild data substantially improves attribution performance on challenging unseen generators, demonstrating that unlabeled data from the wild can be effectively exploited to enhance AI generated content attribution in open world settings.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于国际象棋战术的量子基准测试QKRD，用于评估QAOA在结构化问题上的性能，发现约束保持混合器、热身启动策略等能显著提升表现，而CVaR优化则效果不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的量子近似优化算法（QAOA）主要使用缺乏语义结构和人类可解释性的合成随机实例（如MaxCut、TSP、SAT）进行基准测试，这限制了人们对QAOA在具有有意义约束的现实问题中性能的理解。

Method: 作者提出了量子国王围困统治（QKRD）基准测试，这是一个源自国际象棋战术位置的NISQ级别基准，提供了5000个具有独热约束、空间局部性和10-40量子比特规模的结构化实例。该基准将人类可解释的覆盖指标与对经典启发式算法的内在验证相结合，无需外部预言即可得出算法结论。

Result: 使用QKRD评估发现：约束保持混合器（XY、域壁）比标准混合器收敛快约13步；热身启动策略减少45步收敛步骤，能量改进超过d=8；而条件风险价值（CVaR）优化产生负面结果，能量更差且无覆盖收益。内在验证显示QAOA比贪婪启发式算法性能高12.6%，比随机选择高80.1%。

Conclusion: 结构化基准测试揭示了在随机实例中被掩盖的问题感知QAOA技术的优势，证明了QKRD作为可重现NISQ算法研究工具的价值。

Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is extensively benchmarked on synthetic random instances such as MaxCut, TSP, and SAT problems, but these lack semantic structure and human interpretability, offering limited insight into performance on real-world problems with meaningful constraints. We introduce Quantum King-Ring Domination (QKRD), a NISQ-scale benchmark derived from chess tactical positions that provides 5,000 structured instances with one-hot constraints, spatial locality, and 10--40 qubit scale. The benchmark pairs human-interpretable coverage metrics with intrinsic validation against classical heuristics, enabling algorithmic conclusions without external oracles. Using QKRD, we systematically evaluate QAOA design choices and find that constraint-preserving mixers (XY, domain-wall) converge approximately 13 steps faster than standard mixers (p<10^{-7}, d\approx0.5) while eliminating penalty tuning, warm-start strategies reduce convergence by 45 steps (p<10^{-127}, d=3.35) with energy improvements exceeding d=8, and Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) optimization yields an informative negative result with worse energy (p<10^{-40}, d=1.21) and no coverage benefit. Intrinsic validation shows QAOA outperforms greedy heuristics by 12.6\% and random selection by 80.1\%. Our results demonstrate that structured benchmarks reveal advantages of problem-informed QAOA techniques obscured in random instances. We release all code, data, and experimental artifacts for reproducible NISQ algorithm research.

Conclusion: 提出的自动特征学习方法在视频人体检测任务中表现成功，特别是在无人机平台的非静态摄像头场景下，预训练CNN模型效果最佳，而H-ELM在CPU环境下训练速度相对较快

Abstract: Human detection in videos plays an important role in various real-life applications. Most traditional approaches depend on utilizing handcrafted features, which are problem-dependent and optimal for specific tasks. Moreover, they are highly susceptible to dynamical events such as illumination changes, camera jitter, and variations in object sizes. On the other hand, the proposed feature learning approaches are cheaper and easier because highly abstract and discriminative features can be produced automatically without the need of expert knowledge. In this paper, we utilize automatic feature learning methods, which combine optical flow and three different deep models (i.e., supervised convolutional neural network (S-CNN), pretrained CNN feature extractor, and hierarchical extreme learning machine) for human detection in videos captured using a nonstatic camera on an aerial platform with varying altitudes. The models are trained and tested on the publicly available and highly challenging UCF-ARG aerial dataset. The comparison between these models in terms of training, testing accuracy, and learning speed is analyzed. The performance evaluation considers five human actions (digging, waving, throwing, walking, and running). Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed methods are successful for the human detection task. The pretrained CNN produces an average accuracy of 98.09%. S-CNN produces an average accuracy of 95.6% with softmax and 91.7% with Support Vector Machines (SVM). H-ELM has an average accuracy of 95.9%. Using a normal Central Processing Unit (CPU), H-ELM's training time takes 445 seconds. Learning in S-CNN takes 770 seconds with a high-performance Graphical Processing Unit (GPU).

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The efficacy of deep residual networks is fundamentally predicated on the identity shortcut connection. While this mechanism effectively mitigates the vanishing gradient problem, it imposes a strictly additive inductive bias on feature transformations, thereby limiting the network's capacity to model complex state transitions. In this paper, we introduce Deep Delta Learning (DDL), a novel architecture that generalizes the standard residual connection by modulating the identity shortcut with a learnable, data-dependent geometric transformation. This transformation, termed the Delta Operator, constitutes a rank-1 perturbation of the identity matrix, parameterized by a reflection direction vector $\mathbf{k}(\mathbf{X})$ and a gating scalar $β(\mathbf{X})$. We provide a spectral analysis of this operator, demonstrating that the gate $β(\mathbf{X})$ enables dynamic interpolation between identity mapping, orthogonal projection, and geometric reflection. Furthermore, we restructure the residual update as a synchronous rank-1 injection, where the gate acts as a dynamic step size governing both the erasure of old information and the writing of new features. This unification empowers the network to explicitly control the spectrum of its layer-wise transition operator, enabling the modeling of complex, non-monotonic dynamics while preserving the stable training characteristics of gated residual architectures.

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning has enhanced the flow matching models on human preference alignment. While stochastic sampling enables the exploration of denoising directions, existing methods which optimize over multiple denoising steps suffer from sparse and ambiguous reward signals. We observe that the high entropy steps enable more efficient and effective exploration while the low entropy steps result in undistinguished roll-outs. To this end, we propose E-GRPO, an entropy aware Group Relative Policy Optimization to increase the entropy of SDE sampling steps. Since the integration of stochastic differential equations suffer from ambiguous reward signals due to stochasticity from multiple steps, we specifically merge consecutive low entropy steps to formulate one high entropy step for SDE sampling, while applying ODE sampling on other steps. Building upon this, we introduce multi-step group normalized advantage, which computes group-relative advantages within samples sharing the same consolidated SDE denoising step. Experimental results on different reward settings have demonstrated the effectiveness of our methods.

Abstract: In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) has seen widespread adoption across a broad range of sectors, including high-stakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and law. This growing reliance has raised increasing concerns regarding model interpretability and accountability, particularly as legal and regulatory frameworks place tighter constraints on using black-box models in critical applications. Although interpretable ML has attracted substantial attention, systematic evaluations of inherently interpretable models, especially for tabular data, remain relatively scarce and often focus primarily on aggregated performance outcomes.
  To address this gap, we present a large-scale comparative evaluation of 16 inherently interpretable methods, ranging from classical linear models and decision trees to more recent approaches such as Explainable Boosting Machines (EBMs), Symbolic Regression (SR), and Generalized Optimal Sparse Decision Trees (GOSDT). Our study spans 216 real-world tabular datasets and goes beyond aggregate rankings by stratifying performance according to structural dataset characteristics, including dimensionality, sample size, linearity, and class imbalance. In addition, we assess training time and robustness under controlled distributional shifts. Our results reveal clear performance hierarchies, especially for regression tasks, where EBMs consistently achieve strong predictive accuracy. At the same time, we show that performance is highly context-dependent: SR and Interpretable Generalized Additive Neural Networks (IGANNs) perform particularly well in non-linear regimes, while GOSDT models exhibit pronounced sensitivity to class imbalance. Overall, these findings provide practical guidance for practitioners seeking a balance between interpretability and predictive performance, and contribute to a deeper empirical understanding of interpretable modeling for tabular data.

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection is essential for the reliable operation of complex systems, but most existing methods require extensive task-specific training. We explore whether time series foundation models (TSFMs), pretrained on large heterogeneous data, can serve as universal backbones for anomaly detection. Through systematic experiments across multiple benchmarks, we compare zero-shot inference, full model adaptation, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategies. Our results demonstrate that TSFMs outperform task-specific baselines, achieving notable gains in AUC-PR and VUS-PR, particularly under severe class imbalance. Moreover, PEFT methods such as LoRA, OFT, and HRA not only reduce computational cost but also match or surpass full fine-tuning in most cases, indicating that TSFMs can be efficiently adapted for anomaly detection, even when pretrained for forecasting. These findings position TSFMs as promising general-purpose models for scalable and efficient time series anomaly detection.

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) have garnered much attention for their ability to elucidate the prediction process through a human-understandable concept layer. However, most previous studies focused on static scenarios where the data and concepts are assumed to be fixed and clean. In real-world applications, deployed models require continuous maintenance: we often need to remove erroneous or sensitive data (unlearning), correct mislabeled concepts, or incorporate newly acquired samples (incremental learning) to adapt to evolving environments. Thus, deriving efficient editable CBMs without retraining from scratch remains a significant challenge, particularly in large-scale applications. To address these challenges, we propose Controllable Concept Bottleneck Models (CCBMs). Specifically, CCBMs support three granularities of model editing: concept-label-level, concept-level, and data-level, the latter of which encompasses both data removal and data addition. CCBMs enjoy mathematically rigorous closed-form approximations derived from influence functions that obviate the need for retraining. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and adaptability of our CCBMs, affirming their practical value in enabling dynamic and trustworthy CBMs.

Abstract: We consider the offline imitation learning from observations (LfO) where the expert demonstrations are scarce and the available offline suboptimal data are far from the expert behavior. Many existing distribution-matching approaches struggle in this regime because they impose strict support constraints and rely on brittle one-step models, making it hard to extract useful signal from imperfect data. To tackle this challenge, we propose TGE, a trajectory-level generative embedding for offline LfO that constructs a dense, smooth surrogate reward by estimating expert state density in the latent space of a temporal diffusion model trained on offline trajectory data. By leveraging the smooth geometry of the learned diffusion embedding, TGE captures long-horizon temporal dynamics and effectively bridges the gap between disjoint supports, ensuring a robust learning signal even when offline data is distributionally distinct from the expert. Empirically, the proposed approach consistently matches or outperforms prior offline LfO methods across a range of D4RL locomotion and manipulation benchmarks.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models achieve efficiency through sparse activation, but the role of geometric regularization in expert specialization remains unclear. We apply orthogonality loss to enforce expert diversity and find it fails on multiple fronts: it does not reduce weight-space overlap (MSO actually increases by up to 114%), activation-space overlap remains high (~0.6) regardless of regularization, and effects on performance are inconsistent -- marginal improvement on WikiText-103 (-0.9%), slight degradation on TinyStories (+0.9%), and highly variable results on PTB (std > 1.0). Our analysis across 7 regularization strengths reveals no significant correlation (r = -0.293, p = 0.523) between weight and activation orthogonality. These findings demonstrate that weight-space regularization neither achieves its geometric goal nor reliably improves performance, making it unsuitable for MoE diversity.

Abstract: The manual labeling of events in electroencephalography (EEG) records is time-consuming. This is especially true when EEG recordings are taken continuously over weeks to months. Therefore, a method to automatically label pertinent EEG events reduces the manual workload. Spike wave discharges (SWD), which are the electrographic hallmark of absence seizures, are EEG events that are often labeled manually. While some previous studies have utilized machine learning to automatically segment and classify EEG signals like SWDs, they can be improved. Here we compare the performance of 14 machine learning classifiers on our own manually annotated dataset of 961 hours of EEG recordings from C3H/HeJ mice, including 22,637 labeled SWDs. We find that a 1D UNet performs best for labeling SWDs in this dataset. We also improve the 1D UNet by augmenting our training data and determine that scaling showed the greatest benefit of all augmentation procedures applied. We then compare the 1D UNet with data augmentation, AugUNet1D, against a recently published time- and frequency-based algorithmic approach called "Twin Peaks". AugUNet1D showed superior performance and detected events with more similar features to the SWDs labeled manually. AugUNet1D, pretrained on our manually annotated data or untrained, is made public for others users.

Motivation: 多用户情境赌博中用户通过图关联，奖励函数同时呈现非线性特性和图同质性，需要开发能够有效利用图结构和非线性关系的统一理论框架

Method: 提出联合惩罚项，结合基于RKHS距离的图平滑项和个体粗糙度惩罚，证明其等价于统一多用户RKHS中的平方范数，推导再现核函数融合图拉普拉斯和基础臂核，设计LK-GP-UCB和LK-GP-TS算法

Result: 建立了理论遗憾界限，与多用户核的有效维度而非用户数量或环境维度相关，实验显示在非线性设置中优于线性和无图基线，在线性奖励下仍保持竞争力

Conclusion: 工作提供了一个统一、理论严谨且实用的框架，将拉普拉斯正则化与核化的赌博机结构化探索相结合，为图结构多用户学习提供了系统性解决方案

Abstract: We study multi-user contextual bandits where users are related by a graph and their reward functions exhibit both non-linear behavior and graph homophily. We introduce a principled joint penalty for the collection of user reward functions $\{f_u\}$, combining a graph smoothness term based on RKHS distances with an individual roughness penalty. Our central contribution is proving that this penalty is equivalent to the squared norm within a single, unified \emph{multi-user RKHS}. We explicitly derive its reproducing kernel, which elegantly fuses the graph Laplacian with the base arm kernel. This unification allows us to reframe the problem as learning a single ''lifted'' function, enabling the design of principled algorithms, \texttt{LK-GP-UCB} and \texttt{LK-GP-TS}, that leverage Gaussian Process posteriors over this new kernel for exploration. We provide high-probability regret bounds that scale with an \emph{effective dimension} of the multi-user kernel, replacing dependencies on user count or ambient dimension. Empirically, our methods outperform strong linear and non-graph-aware baselines in non-linear settings and remain competitive even when the true rewards are linear. Our work delivers a unified, theoretically grounded, and practical framework that bridges Laplacian regularization with kernelized bandits for structured exploration.

Abstract: We inspect the analogy between machine-learning (ML) applications based on the transformer architecture without self-attention, {\it neural chains} hereafter, and discrete dynamical systems associated with discretised versions of neural integral and partial differential equations (NIE, PDE). A comparative analysis of the numerical solution of the (viscid and inviscid) Burgers and Eikonal equations via standard numerical discretization (also cast in terms of neural chains) and via PINN's learning is presented and commented on. It is found that standard numerical discretization and PINN learning provide two different paths to acquire essentially the same knowledge about the dynamics of the system. PINN learning proceeds through random matrices which bear no direct relation to the highly structured matrices associated with finite-difference (FD) procedures. Random matrices leading to acceptable solutions are far more numerous than the unique tridiagonal form in matrix space, which explains why the PINN search typically lands on the random ensemble. The price is a much larger number of parameters, causing lack of physical transparency (explainability) as well as large training costs with no counterpart in the FD procedure. However, our results refer to one-dimensional dynamic problems, hence they don't rule out the possibility that PINNs and ML in general, may offer better strategies for high-dimensional problems.

Abstract: Autonomous LLM agents generate multi-step action plans that can fail due to contextual misalignment or structural incoherence. Existing anomaly detection methods are ill-suited for this challenge: mean-pooling embeddings dilutes anomalous steps, while contrastive-only approaches ignore sequential structure. Standard unsupervised methods on pre-trained embeddings achieve F1-scores no higher than 0.69. We introduce Trajectory Guard, a Siamese Recurrent Autoencoder with a hybrid loss function that jointly learns task-trajectory alignment via contrastive learning and sequential validity via reconstruction. This dual objective enables unified detection of both "wrong plan for this task" and "malformed plan structure." On benchmarks spanning synthetic perturbations and real-world failures from security audits (RAS-Eval) and multi-agent systems (Who\&When), we achieve F1-scores of 0.88-0.94 on balanced sets and recall of 0.86-0.92 on imbalanced external benchmarks. At 32 ms inference latency, our approach runs 17-27$\times$ faster than LLM Judge baselines, enabling real-time safety verification in production deployments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LSTM模型在零售行业销售预测中表现准确但计算量大，对中小型零售企业构成挑战。本研究旨在探索LSTM模型压缩，在保持预测精度的前提下降低计算资源需求。

Method: 使用Kaggle Store Item Demand Forecasting数据集（913,000条日销售记录），逐步减少LSTM隐藏单元数量（从128到16），分析模型大小与预测精度之间的权衡关系。

Result: 实验发现：将隐藏单元从128降至64能保持相同的准确率水平甚至有所提升。完整128单元模型的MAPE为23.6%，而64单元模型降至12.4%。优化后的模型体积减少73%（从280KB到76KB），精度提升47%。

Conclusion: 更大规模的模型并不总能取得更好结果；通过压缩LSTM隐藏单元，在显著减小模型规模的同时可以提高预测精度，这为资源受限环境下的实用部署提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Standard LSTM(Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks provide accurate predictions for sales data in the retail industry, but require a lot of computing power. It can be challenging especially for mid to small retail industries. This paper examines LSTM model compression by gradually reducing the number of hidden units from 128 to 16. We used the Kaggle Store Item Demand Forecasting dataset, which has 913,000 daily sales records from 10 stores and 50 items, to look at the trade-off between model size and how accurate the predictions are. Experiments show that lowering the number of hidden LSTM units to 64 maintains the same level of accuracy while also improving it. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) ranges from 23.6% for the full 128-unit model to 12.4% for the 64-unit model. The optimized model is 73% smaller (from 280KB to 76KB) and 47% more accurate. These results show that larger models do not always achieve better results.

Abstract: In this article, we explore federated customization of large models and highlight the key challenges it poses within the federated learning framework. We review several popular large model customization techniques, including full fine-tuning, efficient fine-tuning, prompt engineering, prefix-tuning, knowledge distillation, and retrieval-augmented generation. Then, we discuss how these techniques can be implemented within the federated learning framework. Moreover, we conduct experiments on federated prefix-tuning, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first trial to apply prefix-tuning in the federated learning setting. The conducted experiments validate its feasibility with performance close to centralized approaches. Further comparison with three other federated customization methods demonstrated its competitive performance, satisfactory efficiency, and consistent robustness.

Abstract: Planogram creation is a significant challenge for retail, requiring an average of 30 hours per complex layout. This paper introduces a cloud-native architecture using diffusion models to automatically generate store-specific planograms. Unlike conventional optimization methods that reorganize existing layouts, our system learns from successful shelf arrangements across multiple retail locations to create new planogram configurations. The architecture combines cloud-based model training via AWS with edge deployment for real-time inference. The diffusion model integrates retail-specific constraints through a modified loss function. Simulation-based analysis demonstrates the system reduces planogram design time by 98.3% (from 30 to 0.5 hours) while achieving 94.4% constraint satisfaction. Economic analysis reveals a 97.5% reduction in creation expenses with a 4.4-month break-even period. The cloud-native architecture scales linearly, supporting up to 10,000 concurrent store requests. This work demonstrates the viability of generative AI for automated retail space optimization.

Motivation: 现有的大多数漂移检测方法缺乏系统的动力学解释，在重训练频率与运营成本之间的平衡方面指导有限。需要一种基于原理的方法来有效管理部署时的非平稳数据漂移。

Method: 建模部署时的数据漂移为受Fokker-Planck方程控制的概率流，使用时变Kullback-Leibler散度量化的模型-数据不匹配。通过熵平衡分解推导出不匹配的时间导数，其中包含由概率流驱动的非负熵产生项，以此作为基于熵触发的无标签重训练策略。

Result: 在受控非平稳分类实验中，基于熵触发的重训练取得了与高频重训练相当的预测性能，同时相对于每日和基于标签的策略减少了量级上的重训练次数。

Conclusion: 基于熵的重训练框架提供了一种原理性方法来平衡模型性能与运营成本，通过熵产生检测积累的不匹配，避免依赖延迟的性能崩溃信号，有效减少不必要的重训练。

Abstract: Machine learning models deployed in nonstationary environments experience performance degradation due to data drift. While many drift detection heuristics exist, most lack a principled dynamical interpretation and provide limited guidance on how retraining frequency should be balanced against operational cost. In this work, we propose an entropy--based retraining framework grounded in nonequilibrium stochastic dynamics. Modeling deployment--time data drift as probability flow governed by a Fokker--Planck equation, we quantify model--data mismatch using a time--evolving Kullback--Leibler divergence. We show that the time derivative of this mismatch admits an entropy--balance decomposition featuring a nonnegative entropy production term driven by probability currents. This interpretation motivates entropy--triggered retraining as a label--free intervention strategy that responds to accumulated mismatch rather than delayed performance collapse. In a controlled nonstationary classification experiment, entropy--triggered retraining achieves predictive performance comparable to high--frequency retraining while reducing retraining events by an order of magnitude relative to daily and label--based policies.

Abstract: Over the past decade, numerous theories have been proposed to explain the widespread vulnerability of deep neural networks to adversarial evasion attacks. Among these, the theory of non-robust features proposed by Ilyas et al. has been widely accepted, showing that brittle but predictive features of the data distribution can be directly exploited by attackers. However, this theory overlooks adversarial samples that do not directly utilize these features. In this work, we advocate that these two kinds of samples - those which use use brittle but predictive features and those that do not - comprise two types of adversarial weaknesses and should be differentiated when evaluating adversarial robustness. For this purpose, we propose an ensemble-based metric to measure the manipulation of non-robust features by adversarial perturbations and use this metric to analyze the makeup of adversarial samples generated by attackers. This new perspective also allows us to re-examine multiple phenomena, including the impact of sharpness-aware minimization on adversarial robustness and the robustness gap observed between adversarially training and standard training on robust datasets.

Abstract: Predicting cycling duration for a given route is essential for training planning and event preparation. Existing solutions rely on physics-based models that require extensive parameterization, including aerodynamic drag coefficients and real-time wind forecasts, parameters impractical for most amateur cyclists. This work presents a machine learning approach that predicts ride duration using route topology features combined with the athlete's current fitness state derived from training load metrics. The model learns athlete-specific performance patterns from historical data, substituting complex physical measurements with historical performance proxies. We evaluate the approach using a single-athlete dataset (N=96 rides) in an N-of-1 study design. After rigorous feature engineering to eliminate data leakage, we find that Lasso regression with Topology + Fitness features achieves MAE=6.60 minutes and R2=0.922. Notably, integrating fitness metrics (CTL, ATL) reduces error by 14% compared to topology alone (MAE=7.66 min), demonstrating that physiological state meaningfully constrains performance even in self-paced efforts. Progressive checkpoint predictions enable dynamic race planning as route difficulty becomes apparent.

Abstract: Maximizing submodular objectives under constraints is a fundamental problem in machine learning and optimization. We study the maximization of a nonnegative, non-monotone $γ$-weakly DR-submodular function over a down-closed convex body. Our main result is an approximation algorithm whose guarantee depends smoothly on $γ$; in particular, when $γ=1$ (the DR-submodular case) our bound recovers the $0.401$ approximation factor, while for $γ<1$ the guarantee degrades gracefully and, it improves upon previously reported bounds for $γ$-weakly DR-submodular maximization under the same constraints. Our approach combines a Frank-Wolfe-guided continuous-greedy framework with a $γ$-aware double-greedy step, yielding a simple yet effective procedure for handling non-monotonicity. This results in state-of-the-art guarantees for non-monotone $γ$-weakly DR-submodular maximization over down-closed convex bodies.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini increasingly act as general-purpose copilots, yet they often respond with unnecessary length on simple requests, adding redundant explanations, hedging, or boilerplate that increases cognitive load and inflates token-based inference cost. Prior work suggests that preference-based post-training and LLM-judged evaluations can induce systematic length bias, where longer answers are rewarded even at comparable quality.
  We introduce YapBench, a lightweight benchmark for quantifying user-visible over-generation on brevity-ideal prompts. Each item consists of a single-turn prompt, a curated minimal-sufficient baseline answer, and a category label. Our primary metric, YapScore, measures excess response length beyond the baseline in characters, enabling comparisons across models without relying on any specific tokenizer. We summarize model performance via the YapIndex, a uniformly weighted average of category-level median YapScores.
  YapBench contains over three hundred English prompts spanning three common brevity-ideal settings: (A) minimal or ambiguous inputs where the ideal behavior is a short clarification, (B) closed-form factual questions with short stable answers, and (C) one-line coding tasks where a single command or snippet suffices. Evaluating 76 assistant LLMs, we observe an order-of-magnitude spread in median excess length and distinct category-specific failure modes, including vacuum-filling on ambiguous inputs and explanation or formatting overhead on one-line technical requests. We release the benchmark and maintain a live leaderboard for tracking verbosity behavior over time.

Abstract: This paper introduces Interpretability-Guided Bi-objective Optimization (IGBO), a framework that trains interpretable models by incorporating structured domain knowledge via a bi-objective formulation. IGBO encodes feature importance hierarchies as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and uses Temporal Integrated Gradients (TIG) to measure feature importance. To address the Out-of-Distribution (OOD) problem in TIG computation, we propose an Optimal Path Oracle that learns data-manifold-aware integration paths. Theoretical analysis proves convergence properties and robustness to mini-batch noise, while empirical results on time-series data demonstrate IGBO's effectiveness in enforcing DAG constraints with minimal accuracy loss, outperforming standard regularization baselines.

Abstract: Talking head generation creates lifelike avatars from static portraits for virtual communication and content creation. However, current models do not yet convey the feeling of truly interactive communication, often generating one-way responses that lack emotional engagement. We identify two key challenges toward truly interactive avatars: generating motion in real-time under causal constraints and learning expressive, vibrant reactions without additional labeled data. To address these challenges, we propose Avatar Forcing, a new framework for interactive head avatar generation that models real-time user-avatar interactions through diffusion forcing. This design allows the avatar to process real-time multimodal inputs, including the user's audio and motion, with low latency for instant reactions to both verbal and non-verbal cues such as speech, nods, and laughter. Furthermore, we introduce a direct preference optimization method that leverages synthetic losing samples constructed by dropping user conditions, enabling label-free learning of expressive interaction. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework enables real-time interaction with low latency (approximately 500ms), achieving 6.8X speedup compared to the baseline, and produces reactive and expressive avatar motion, which is preferred over 80% against the baseline.

Abstract: Generative Reward Models (GRMs) have attracted considerable research interest in reward modeling due to their interpretability, inference-time scalability, and potential for refinement through reinforcement learning (RL). However, widely used pairwise GRMs create a computational bottleneck when integrated with RL algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This bottleneck arises from two factors: (i) the O(n^2) time complexity of pairwise comparisons required to obtain relative scores, and (ii) the computational overhead of repeated sampling or additional chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to improve performance. To address the first factor, we propose Intergroup Relative Preference Optimization (IRPO), a novel RL framework that incorporates the well-established Bradley-Terry model into GRPO. By generating a pointwise score for each response, IRPO enables efficient evaluation of arbitrarily many candidates during RL training while preserving interpretability and fine-grained reward signals. Experimental results demonstrate that IRPO achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among pointwise GRMs across multiple benchmarks, with performance comparable to that of current leading pairwise GRMs. Furthermore, we show that IRPO significantly outperforms pairwise GRMs in post-training evaluations.

Abstract: Ticket troubleshooting refers to the process of analyzing and resolving problems that are reported through a ticketing system. In large organizations offering a wide range of services, this task is highly complex due to the diversity of submitted tickets and the need for specialized domain knowledge. In particular, troubleshooting in telecommunications (telecom) is a very time-consuming task as it requires experts to interpret ticket content, consult documentation, and search historical records to identify appropriate resolutions. This human-intensive approach not only delays issue resolution but also hinders overall operational efficiency. To enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of ticket troubleshooting in telecom, we propose TeleDoCTR, a novel telecom-related, domain-specific, and contextual troubleshooting system tailored for end-to-end ticket resolution in telecom. TeleDoCTR integrates both domain-specific ranking and generative models to automate key steps of the troubleshooting workflow which are: routing tickets to the appropriate expert team responsible for resolving the ticket (classification task), retrieving contextually and semantically similar historical tickets (retrieval task), and generating a detailed fault analysis report outlining the issue, root cause, and potential solutions (generation task). We evaluate TeleDoCTR on a real-world dataset from a telecom infrastructure and demonstrate that it achieves superior performance over existing state-of-the-art methods, significantly enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of the troubleshooting process.

Abstract: Many multi-agent interaction scenarios can be naturally modeled as noncooperative games, where each agent's decisions depend on others' future actions. However, deploying game-theoretic planners for autonomous decision-making requires a specification of all agents' objectives. To circumvent this practical difficulty, recent work develops maximum likelihood techniques for solving inverse games that can identify unknown agent objectives from interaction data. Unfortunately, these methods only infer point estimates and do not quantify estimator uncertainty; correspondingly, downstream planning decisions can overconfidently commit to unsafe actions. We present an approximate Bayesian inference approach for solving the inverse game problem, which can incorporate observation data from multiple modalities and be used to generate samples from the Bayesian posterior over the hidden agent objectives given limited sensor observations in real time. Concretely, the proposed Bayesian inverse game framework trains a structured variational autoencoder with an embedded differentiable Nash game solver on interaction datasets and does not require labels of agents' true objectives. Extensive experiments show that our framework successfully learns prior and posterior distributions, improves inference quality over maximum likelihood estimation-based inverse game approaches, and enables safer downstream decision-making without sacrificing efficiency. When trajectory information is uninformative or unavailable, multimodal inference further reduces uncertainty by exploiting additional observation modalities.

Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting using transformers is hampered by the quadratic complexity of self-attention and the rigidity of uniform patching, which may be misaligned with the data's semantic structure. In this paper, we introduce the \textit{B-Spline Adaptive Tokenizer (BSAT)}, a novel, parameter-free method that adaptively segments a time series by fitting it with B-splines. BSAT algorithmically places tokens in high-curvature regions and represents each variable-length basis function as a fixed-size token, composed of its coefficient and position. Further, we propose a hybrid positional encoding that combines a additive learnable positional encoding with Rotary Positional Embedding featuring a layer-wise learnable base: L-RoPE. This allows each layer to attend to different temporal dependencies. Our experiments on several public benchmarks show that our model is competitive with strong performance at high compression rates. This makes it particularly well-suited for use cases with strong memory constraints.

Abstract: We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for adaptive precision tuning of linear solvers, and can be extended to general algorithms. The framework is formulated as a contextual bandit problem and solved using incremental action-value estimation with a discretized state space to select optimal precision configurations for computational steps, balancing precision and computational efficiency. To verify its effectiveness, we apply the framework to iterative refinement for solving linear systems $Ax = b$. In this application, our approach dynamically chooses precisions based on calculated features from the system. In detail, a Q-table maps discretized features (e.g., approximate condition number and matrix norm)to actions (chosen precision configurations for specific steps), optimized via an epsilon-greedy strategy to maximize a multi-objective reward balancing accuracy and computational cost. Empirical results demonstrate effective precision selection, reducing computational cost while maintaining accuracy comparable to double-precision baselines. The framework generalizes to diverse out-of-sample data and offers insight into utilizing RL precision selection for other numerical algorithms, advancing mixed-precision numerical methods in scientific computing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on precision autotuning with RL and verified on unseen datasets.

Abstract: State-of-the-art large language model (LLM) pipelines rely on bootstrapped reasoning loops: sampling diverse chains of thought and reinforcing the highest-scoring ones, mainly optimizing correctness. We analyze how this design choice is sensitive to the collapse of the model's distribution over reasoning paths, slashing semantic entropy and undermining creative problem-solving. To analyze this failure, we introduce Distributional Creative Reasoning (DCR), a unified variational objective that casts training as gradient flow through probability measures on solution traces. STaR, GRPO, and DPO, as well as entropy bonuses, and other methods, all constitute special cases of the same loss. The framework delivers three core results: (i) the diversity decay theorem, describing how correctness-based objectives lead to distinct modes of diversity decay for STaR, GRPO, and DPO; (ii) designs that ensure convergence to a stable and diverse policy, effectively preventing collapse; and (iii) simple, actionable recipes to achieve this in practice. DCR thus offers the first principled recipe for LLMs that remain both correct and creative.

Motivation: 现有方法需要训练数据或微调，缺乏无训练的有效数学推理检测方法。通过图谱分析注意力模式可以提供一种理论框架来验证推理有效性，应用于幻觉检测和AI安全监控。

Method: 将注意力矩阵视为token动态图的邻接矩阵，提取四个图谱诊断指标：费德勒值（代数连通性）、高频能量比、图信号平滑度和图谱熵，通过单阈值判断推理有效性。

Result: 在7个不同架构的Transformer模型上验证，效应量最高达Cohen's d=3.30，分类准确率85.0-95.6%，发现图谱方法检测的是逻辑一致性而非形式验证器的接受度。

Conclusion: 图谱分析为推理验证提供了理论框架，无需训练即可高精度检测有效数学推理，注意力机制设计影响哪些图谱特征捕获推理有效性，具有直接应用于幻觉检测和AI安全监控的价值。

Abstract: We present a training-free method for detecting valid mathematical reasoning in large language models through spectral analysis of attention patterns. By treating attention matrices as adjacency matrices of dynamic graphs over tokens, we extract four interpretable spectral diagnostics, the Fiedler value (algebraic connectivity), high-frequency energy ratio (HFER), graph signal smoothness, and spectral entropy, that exhibit statistically significant differences between valid and invalid mathematical proofs. Experiments across seven transformer models from four independent architectural families (Meta Llama, Alibaba Qwen, Microsoft Phi, and Mistral AI) demonstrate that this spectral signature produces effect sizes up to Cohen's $d = 3.30$ ($p < 10^{-116}$), enabling 85.0--95.6\% classification accuracy under rigorous evaluation, with calibrated thresholds reaching 93--95\% on the full dataset. The method requires no training data, fine-tuning, or learned classifiers: a single threshold on a spectral metric suffices for high accuracy. Through systematic label correction, we discover that the spectral method detects logical coherence rather than compiler acceptance, identifying mathematically valid proofs that formal verifiers reject due to technical failures. We further identify an architectural dependency: Mistral-7B's Sliding Window Attention shifts the discriminative signal from HFER to late-layer Smoothness ($d = 2.09$, $p_{\text{MW}} = 1.16 \times 10^{-48}$), revealing that attention mechanism design affects which spectral features capture reasoning validity. These findings establish spectral graph analysis as a principled framework for reasoning verification with immediate applications to hallucination detection and AI safety monitoring.

Abstract: Evaluating off-ball defensive performance in football is challenging, as traditional metrics do not capture the nuanced coordinated movements that limit opponent action selection and success probabilities. Although widely used possession value models excel at appraising on-ball actions, their application to defense remains limited. Existing counterfactual methods, such as ghosting models, help extend these analyses but often rely on simulating "average" behavior that lacks tactical context. To address this, we introduce a covariate-dependent Hidden Markov Model (CDHMM) tailored to corner kicks, a highly structured aspect of football games. Our label-free model infers time-resolved man-marking and zonal assignments directly from player tracking data. We leverage these assignments to propose a novel framework for defensive credit attribution and a role-conditioned ghosting method for counterfactual analysis of off-ball defensive performance. We show how these contributions provide a interpretable evaluation of defensive contributions against context-aware baselines.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a mainstay for many everyday applications. However, as data evolve their knowledge quickly becomes outdated. Continual learning aims to update LLMs with new information without erasing previously acquired knowledge. Although methods such as full fine-tuning can incorporate new data, they are computationally expensive and prone to catastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge is overwritten. Memory-augmented approaches address this by equipping LLMs with a memory bank, that is an external memory module which stores information for future use. However, these methods face a critical limitation, in particular, the memory bank constantly grows in the real-world scenario when large-scale data streams arrive. In this paper, we propose MBC, a model that compresses the memory bank through a codebook optimization strategy during online adaptation learning. To ensure stable learning, we also introduce an online resetting mechanism that prevents codebook collapse. In addition, we employ Key-Value Low-Rank Adaptation in the attention layers of the LLM, enabling efficient utilization of the compressed memory representations. Experiments with benchmark question-answering datasets demonstrate that MBC reduces the memory bank size to 0.3% when compared against the most competitive baseline, while maintaining high retention accuracy during online adaptation learning.

Abstract: Gradient-based optimization with categorical variables typically relies on score-function estimators, which are unbiased but noisy, or on continuous relaxations that replace the discrete distribution with a smooth surrogate admitting a pathwise (reparameterized) gradient, at the cost of optimizing a biased, temperature-dependent objective. In this paper, we extend this family of relaxations by introducing a diffusion-based soft reparameterization for categorical distributions. For these distributions, the denoiser under a Gaussian noising process admits a closed form and can be computed efficiently, yielding a training-free diffusion sampler through which we can backpropagate. Our experiments show that the proposed reparameterization trick yields competitive or improved optimization performance on various benchmarks.

Abstract: Despite the growing interest in low-altitude economy (LAE) applications, including UAV-based logistics and emergency response, fundamental challenges remain in orchestrating such missions over complex, signal-constrained environments. These include the absence of real-time, resilient, and context-aware orchestration of aerial nodes with limited integration of artificial intelligence (AI) specialized for LAE missions. This paper introduces an open radio access network (O-RAN)-enabled LAE framework that leverages seamless coordination between the disaggregated RAN architecture, open interfaces, and RAN intelligent controllers (RICs) to facilitate closed-loop, AI-optimized, and mission-critical LAE operations. We evaluate the feasibility and performance of the proposed architecture via a semantic-aware rApp that acts as a terrain interpreter, offering semantic guidance to a reinforcement learning-enabled xApp, which performs real-time trajectory planning for LAE swarm nodes. We survey the capabilities of UAV testbeds that can be leveraged for LAE research, and present critical research challenges and standardization needs.

Abstract: The decarbonization of the energy sector has led to a significant high penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs), particularly photovoltaic (PV) systems, in low-voltage (LV) distribution networks. To maintain grid stability, recent standards (e.g., IEEE 1547-2018) mandate DERs to provide grid-support functionalities through smart inverters (SIs), which typically operate autonomously based on local measurements. However, as DER penetration increases, uncoordinated control modes of SIs can lead to adverse interactions, compromising system efficiency, voltage regulation, and overall stability. While previous studies have demonstrated the benefits of coordinated inverter control and optimal dispatch strategies, the system-wide impacts of heterogeneous SI groups operating under different control modes remain largely unexamined. This paper addresses this gap by assessing the dynamic interactions among multiple SI groups with varying control strategies, namely: Constant Power Factor (CPF), Volt-VAR, and Volt-Watt modes. Furthermore, the analysis covers both resistive and inductive feeder types. The validation is performed using a real-time setup. The CIRGE low-voltage (LV) distribution network is simulated in the Opal-RT platform as the test network, enabling realistic and high-fidelity evaluation of SI control interactions under practical grid conditions.

Conclusion: 概率感知停车选择模型能更好地处理停车可用性的动态特性，改进停车导航系统

Abstract: Current parking navigation systems often underestimate total travel time by failing to account for the time spent searching for a parking space, which significantly affects user experience, mode choice, congestion, and emissions. To address this issue, this paper introduces the probability-aware parking selection problem, which aims to direct drivers to the best parking location rather than straight to their destination. An adaptable dynamic programming framework is proposed for decision-making based on probabilistic information about parking availability at the parking lot level. Closed-form analysis determines when it is optimal to target a specific parking lot or explore alternatives, as well as the expected time cost. Sensitivity analysis and three illustrative cases are examined, demonstrating the model's ability to account for the dynamic nature of parking availability. Acknowledging the financial costs of permanent sensing infrastructure, the paper provides analytical and empirical assessments of errors incurred when leveraging stochastic observations to estimate parking availability. Experiments with real-world data from the US city of Seattle indicate this approach's viability, with mean absolute error decreasing from 7% to below 2% as observation frequency grows. In data-based simulations, probability-aware strategies demonstrate time savings up to 66% relative to probability-unaware baselines, yet still take up to 123% longer than direct-to-destination estimates.

Abstract: This paper presents a decentralized control framework for distribution matching in multi-agent systems (MAS), where agents collectively achieve a prescribed terminal spatial distribution. The problem is formulated using optimal transport (Wasserstein distance), which provides a principled measure of distributional discrepancy and serves as the basis for the control design. To avoid solving the global optimal transport problem directly, the distribution-matching objective is reformulated into a tractable per-agent decision process, enabling each agent to identify its desired terminal locations using only locally available information. A sequential weight-update rule is introduced to construct feasible local transport plans, and a memory-based correction mechanism is incorporated to maintain reliable operation under intermittent and range-limited communication. Convergence guarantees are established, showing cycle-wise improvement of a surrogate transport cost under both linear and nonlinear agent dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves effective and scalable distribution matching while operating fully in a decentralized manner.

Abstract: Stability analysis of switched systems, characterized by multiple operational modes and switching signals, is challenging due to their nonlinear dynamics. While frameworks such as multiple Lyapunov functions (MLF) provide a foundation for analysis, their computational applicability is limited for systems without favorable structure. This paper investigates stability analysis for switched systems under state-dependent switching conditions. We propose neural multiple Lyapunov functions (NMLF), a unified framework that combines the theoretical guarantees of MLF with the computational efficiency of neural Lyapunov functions (NLF). Our approach leverages a set of tailored loss functions and a counter-example guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS) scheme to train neural networks that rigorously satisfy MLF conditions. Through comprehensive simulations and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate NMLF's effectiveness and its potential for practical deployment in complex switched systems.

Abstract: Classic problem-space theory models problem solving as a navigation through a structured space of states, operators, goals, and constraints. Systems Engineering (SE) employs analogous constructs (functional analysis, operational analysis, scenarios, trade studies), yet still lacks a rigorous systems-theoretic representation of the problem space itself. In current practice, reasoning often proceeds directly from stakeholder goals to prescriptive artifacts. This makes foundational assumptions about the operational environment, admissible interactions, and contextual conditions implicit or prematurely embedded in architectures or requirements. This paper addresses that gap by formalizing the problem space as an explicit semantic world model containing theoretical constructs that are defined prior to requirements and solution commitments. These constructs along with the developed axioms, theorems and corollary establish a rigorous criterion for unambiguous boundary semantics, context-dependent interaction traceability to successful stakeholder goal satisfaction, and sufficiency of problem-space specification over which disciplined reasoning can occur independent of solution design. It offers a clear distinction between what is true of the problem domain and what is chosen as a solution. The paper concludes by discussing the significance of the theory on practitioners and provides a dialogue-based hypothetical case study between a stakeholder and an engineer, demonstrating how the theory guides problem framing before designing any prescriptive artifacts.

Abstract: Pediatric pneumonia remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. Timely and accurate diagnosis is critical but often challenged by limited radiological expertise and the physiological and procedural complexity of pediatric imaging. This study investigates the performance of state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures ResNetRS, RegNet, and EfficientNetV2 using transfer learning for the automated classification of pediatric chest Xray images as either pneumonia or normal.A curated subset of 1,000 chest X-ray images was extracted from a publicly available dataset originally comprising 5,856 pediatric images. All images were preprocessed and labeled for binary classification. Each model was fine-tuned using pretrained ImageNet weights and evaluated based on accuracy and sensitivity. RegNet achieved the highest classification performance with an accuracy of 92.4 and a sensitivity of 90.1, followed by ResNetRS (accuracy: 91.9, sensitivity: 89.3) and EfficientNetV2 (accuracy: 88.5, sensitivity: 88.1).

Abstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) is adopted for identity authentication in wearable devices due to its individual-specific characteristics and inherent liveness. However, existing methods often treat heartbeats as homogeneous signals, overlooking the phase-specific characteristics within the cardiac cycle. To address this, we propose a Hierarchical Phase-Aware Fusion~(HPAF) framework that explicitly avoids cross-feature entanglement through a three-stage design. In the first stage, Intra-Phase Representation (IPR) independently extracts representations for each cardiac phase, ensuring that phase-specific morphological and variation cues are preserved without interference from other phases. In the second stage, Phase-Grouped Hierarchical Fusion (PGHF) aggregates physiologically related phases in a structured manner, enabling reliable integration of complementary phase information. In the final stage, Global Representation Fusion (GRF) further combines the grouped representations and adaptively balances their contributions to produce a unified and discriminative identity representation. Moreover, considering ECG signals are continuously acquired, multiple heartbeats can be collected for each individual. We propose a Heartbeat-Aware Multi-prototype (HAM) enrollment strategy, which constructs a multi-prototype gallery template set to reduce the impact of heartbeat-specific noise and variability. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that HPAF achieves state-of-the-art results in the comparison with other methods under both closed and open-set settings.

Abstract: Melanoma is the most lethal subtype of skin cancer, and early and accurate detection of this disease can greatly improve patients' outcomes. Although machine learning models, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown great potential in automating melanoma classification, their diagnostic reliability still suffers due to inconsistent focus on lesion areas. In this study, we analyze the relationship between lesion attention and diagnostic performance, involving masked images, bounding box detection, and transfer learning. We used multiple explainability and sensitivity analysis approaches to investigate how well models aligned their attention with lesion areas and how this alignment correlated with precision, recall, and F1-score. Results showed that models with a higher focus on lesion areas achieved better diagnostic performance, suggesting the potential of interpretable AI in medical diagnostics. This study provides a foundation for developing more accurate and trustworthy melanoma classification models in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超低剂量CT成像可以大大减少患者辐射暴露，但由此产生的扫描图像存在严重的结构性和随机性噪声，这会降低图像质量。需要一种能在超低剂量下保持诊断质量的重建方法。

Conclusion: 在模拟和临床数据集上的定性和定量结果表明，该框架能有效减少条纹和结构化伪影，同时保留细微组织对比度，是一种有前景的超低剂量CT重建工具。

Abstract: Ultra-low-dose CT (ULDCT) imaging can greatly reduce patient radiation exposure, but the resulting scans suffer from severe structured and random noise that degrades image quality. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Plug-and-Play model-based iterative reconstruction framework (PnP-MBIR) that integrates a deep convolutional denoiser trained in a 2-stage self-supervised Noise-to-Noise (N2N) scheme. The method alternates between enforcing sinogram-domain data fidelity and applying the learned image-domain denoiser within an optimization, enabling artifact suppression while maintaining anatomical structure. The 2-stage protocol enables fully self-supervised training from noisy data, followed by high-dose fine-tuning, ensuring the denoiser's robustness in the ultra-low-dose regime. Our method enables high-quality reconstructions at $\sim$70--80\% lower dose levels, while maintaining diagnostic fidelity comparable to standard full-dose scans. Quantitative evaluations using Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features -- including contrast, homogeneity, entropy, and correlation -- confirm that the proposed method yields superior texture consistency and detail preservation over standalone deep learning and supervised PnP baselines. Qualitative and quantitative results on both simulated and clinical datasets demonstrate that our framework effectively reduces streaks and structured artifacts while preserving subtle tissue contrast, making it a promising tool for ULDCT reconstruction.

Abstract: Camera-based physiological monitoring, such as remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), captures subtle variations in skin optical properties caused by pulsatile blood volume changes using standard digital camera sensors. The demand for real-time, non-contact physiological measurement has increased significantly, particularly during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, to support telehealth and remote health monitoring applications. In this work, we propose an attention-based knowledge distillation (KD) framework, termed KDPhys, for extracting rPPG signals from facial video sequences. The proposed method distills global temporal representations from a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) teacher model to a lightweight 2D CNN student model through effective 3D-to-2D feature distillation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of knowledge distillation in the rPPG domain. Furthermore, we introduce a Distortion Loss incorporating Shape and Time (DILATE), which jointly accounts for both morphological and temporal characteristics of rPPG signals. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations are conducted on three benchmark datasets. The proposed model achieves a significant reduction in computational complexity, using only half the parameters of existing methods while operating 56.67% faster. With just 0.23M parameters, it achieves an 18.15% reduction in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) compared to state-of-the-art approaches, attaining an average MAE of 1.78 bpm across all datasets. Additional experiments under diverse environmental conditions and activity scenarios further demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: 提出一种推理感知的知识检索方法，通过粗粒度到细粒度的知识检索机制来增强大型语言模型的性能，使检索的信息更贴合对话的逻辑结构，而不仅仅是表面语义相似性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型目前主要通过检索语义相似信息或提升推理能力来增强性能，但如何有效整合检索和推理策略仍是一个重大挑战。现有方法在将检索的知识与对话的逻辑结构对齐方面存在不足。

Method: 采用粗粒度到细粒度的知识检索方法：首先识别知识库中与上下文相关的子区域，确保所有句子都与主题相关；然后在该子区域内细化搜索，提取与推理过程特别相关的知识。在两个阶段中都使用蒙特卡洛树搜索启发的搜索方法，通过常见关键词在知识句子中进行导航。

Result: 在两个多轮对话数据集上的实验表明，该知识检索方法不仅更贴合人类对话的底层推理逻辑，还显著提高了检索知识的多样性，从而产生更具信息量和创造性的回答。

Conclusion: 推理感知的知识检索方法能够有效提升大型语言模型的性能，通过将检索知识与对话的逻辑结构对齐，增强了模型的理解和生成能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) typically enhance their performance through either the retrieval of semantically similar information or the improvement of their reasoning capabilities. However, a significant challenge remains in effectively integrating both retrieval and reasoning strategies to optimize LLM performance. In this paper, we introduce a reasoning-aware knowledge retrieval method that enriches LLMs with information aligned to the logical structure of conversations, moving beyond surface-level semantic similarity. We follow a coarse-to-fine approach for knowledge retrieval. First, we identify a contextually relevant sub-region of the knowledge base, ensuring that all sentences within it are relevant to the context topic. Next, we refine our search within this sub-region to extract knowledge that is specifically relevant to the reasoning process. Throughout both phases, we employ the Monte Carlo Tree Search-inspired search method to effectively navigate through knowledge sentences using common keywords. Experiments on two multi-turn dialogue datasets demonstrate that our knowledge retrieval approach not only aligns more closely with the underlying reasoning in human conversations but also significantly enhances the diversity of the retrieved knowledge, resulting in more informative and creative responses.

Abstract: Depression is a major contributor to the mental-health burden in Nigeria, yet screening coverage remains limited due to low access to clinicians, stigma, and language barriers. Traditional tools like the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) were validated in high-income countries but may be linguistically or culturally inaccessible for low- and middle-income countries and communities such as Nigeria where people communicate in Nigerian Pidgin and more than 520 local languages. This study presents a novel approach to automated depression screening using fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) adapted for conversational Nigerian Pidgin. We collected a dataset of 432 Pidgin-language audio responses from Nigerian young adults aged 18-40 to prompts assessing psychological experiences aligned with PHQ-9 items, performed transcription, rigorous preprocessing and annotation, including semantic labeling, slang and idiom interpretation, and PHQ-9 severity scoring. Three LLMs - Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct, Gemma-3-4B-it, and GPT-4.1 - were fine-tuned on this annotated dataset, and their performance was evaluated quantitatively (accuracy, precision and semantic alignment) and qualitatively (clarity, relevance, and cultural appropriateness). GPT-4.1 achieved the highest quantitative performance, with 94.5% accuracy in PHQ-9 severity scoring prediction, outperforming Gemma-3-4B-it and Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct. Qualitatively, GPT-4.1 also produced the most culturally appropriate, clear, and contextually relevant responses. AI-mediated depression screening for underserved Nigerian communities. This work provides a foundation for deploying conversational mental-health tools in linguistically diverse, resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: We present a physical theory of intelligence grounded in irreversible information processing in systems constrained by conservation laws. An intelligent system is modelled as a coupled agent-environment process whose evolution transforms information into goal-directed work. To connect information to physical state, we introduce the Conservation-Congruent Encoding (CCE) framework, in which encodings correspond to metastable basins of attraction whose separability is enforced by conservation laws. Within this framework, intelligence is defined as the amount of goal-directed work produced per nat of irreversibly processed information. From this definition we derive a hierarchy of physical constraints governing information intake, irreversible computation, and work extraction in open systems. The framework reveals how long-horizon efficiency requires the preservation of internal informational structure, giving rise to self-modelling, and it establishes that physically embodied intelligent systems possess intrinsic epistemic limits analogous to incompleteness phenomena. Applying the theory to biological systems, we analyse how oscillatory and near-critical dynamics optimise the trade-off between information preservation, dissipation, and useful work, placing the brain near an efficient operating regime predicted by the framework. At the architectural level, we develop a theory of continuous dynamical circuits in which classical Boolean logic emerges as a special case of attractor selection, while more general invariant geometries support computational modes beyond fixed-point logic. Finally, we propose a physically grounded perspective on artificial intelligence safety based on irreversible information flow and structural homeostasis. Together, these results provide a unified, substrate-neutral account of intelligence as a physical phenomenon.

Motivation: 传统的基于地理邻近的包裹配送人员分配方法效率低下，容易导致配送人员间工作量分配不均，需要一种能平衡工作量并优化配送时间的系统性解决方案。

Method: 提出多算法组合方法，结合k-means算法不同变体、进化算法、基于k-means初始化的递归分配（不同问题编码）以及混合进化集成算法，在考虑配送点距离和人员位置的同时，确保每日工作量均衡分配。

Conclusion: 所提出的多算法方法能够有效解决末端配送系统的工作量平衡问题，通过结合距离和工作量考虑因素，实现了配送人员之间的均衡工作量分配。

Abstract: Efficient workload assignment to the workforce is critical in last-mile package delivery systems. In this context, traditional methods of assigning package deliveries to workers based on geographical proximity can be inefficient and surely guide to an unbalanced workload distribution among delivery workers. In this paper, we look at the problem of operational human resources workload balancing in last-mile urban package delivery systems. The idea is to consider the effort workload to optimize the system, i.e., the optimization process is now focused on improving the delivery time, so that the workload balancing is complete among all the staff. This process should correct significant decompensations in workload among delivery workers in a given zone. Specifically, we propose a multi-algorithm approach to tackle this problem. The proposed approach takes as input a set of delivery points and a defined number of workers, and then assigns packages to workers, in such a way that it ensures that each worker completes a similar amount of work per day. The proposed algorithms use a combination of distance and workload considerations to optimize the allocation of packages to workers. In this sense, the distance between the delivery points and the location of each worker is also taken into account. The proposed multi-algorithm methodology includes different versions of k-means, evolutionary approaches, recursive assignments based on k-means initialization with different problem encodings, and a hybrid evolutionary ensemble algorithm. We have illustrated the performance of the proposed approach in a real-world problem in an urban last-mile package delivery workforce operating at Azuqueca de Henares, Spain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统拉米纸牌策略通常依赖直觉或简单启发式方法，缺乏形式化和可解释的算法框架，因此需要一种能够准确评估手牌结构接近完成度的量化方法。

Method: 提出MinDist评估指标（修改自MinScore），利用动态剪枝和模式缓存的算法高效计算手牌与最近有效配置间的编辑距离，并结合对手手牌建模与两人零和博弈模拟框架。

Result: 实证结果显示基于MinDist的智能体相比传统启发式方法在胜率上有显著提升。

Conclusion: MinDist提供了一种形式化、可解释的拉米纸牌策略设计方法，为算法化游戏策略发展迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: The 13-card variant of Classic Indian Rummy is a sequential game of incomplete information that requires probabilistic reasoning and combinatorial decision-making. This paper proposes a rule-based framework for strategic play, driven by a new hand-evaluation metric termed MinDist. The metric modifies the MinScore metric by quantifying the edit distance between a hand and the nearest valid configuration, thereby capturing structural proximity to completion. We design a computationally efficient algorithm derived from the MinScore algorithm, leveraging dynamic pruning and pattern caching to exactly calculate this metric during play. Opponent hand-modeling is also incorporated within a two-player zero-sum simulation framework, and the resulting strategies are evaluated using statistical hypothesis testing. Empirical results show significant improvement in win rates for MinDist-based agents over traditional heuristics, providing a formal and interpretable step toward algorithmic Rummy strategy design.

Result: AI能可靠地复制几何图案，但在材料和气候推理方面存在误读；使用参考图像能提高现实感但限制创造性，而无参考自由生成则产生有创意但文化上模糊的结果。

Conclusion: 研究定义了视觉相似性和建筑推理之间的边界，提出计算性乡土推理作为分析AI感知、扭曲和重新想象传统设计智能的框架。

Abstract: This study investigates how generative AI systems interpret the architectural intelligence embedded in vernacular form. Using the Iranian pigeon tower as a case study, the research tests three diffusion models, Midjourney v6, DALL-E 3, and DreamStudio based on Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), across three prompt stages: referential, adaptive, and speculative. A five-criteria evaluation framework assesses how each system reconstructs typology, materiality, environment, realism, and cultural specificity. Results show that AI reliably reproduces geometric patterns but misreads material and climatic reasoning. Reference imagery improves realism yet limits creativity, while freedom from reference generates inventive but culturally ambiguous outcomes. The findings define a boundary between visual resemblance and architectural reasoning, positioning computational vernacular reasoning as a framework for analyzing how AI perceives, distorts, and reimagines traditional design intelligence.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个LLM智能体框架，用于从原始文本中提取因果反馈模糊认知图谱（FCMs）。该过程结合了LLM的自主性和FCM动力学系统的均衡状态，形成双向的因果学习循环。论文测试了从亨利·基辛格关于AI前景的论文中提取FCM，结果显示算法生成的FCM与人工构建的FCM具有相同的均衡极限环。混合不同LLM生成的FCM能产生新的均衡点，更好地逼近基础因果系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人员旨在开发一种能半自主地从文本中提取和理解因果关系的智能体。传统的FCM构建依赖人工专家，过程耗时且主观。利用LLM的能力自动化这一过程，可以更高效地从复杂文本中提取因果结构，同时通过反馈机制不断改进FCM，实现更接近真实因果系统的建模。

Method: 开发了一个包含三个精细调优指令的LLM智能体框架：1）从文本中提取关键名词和名词短语；2）从这些名词中选择FCM概念节点；3）推断FCM节点间的部分或模糊因果边。FCM的动态系统均衡状态驱动LLM智能体获取和处理因果文本，形成双向反馈。在亨利·基辛格关于AI的论文上进行测试，并混合了不同LLM生成的FCM以验证其效果。

Result: 通过对基辛格论文的测试，即使节点和边数不同，算法生成的FCM仍与人工构建的FCM收敛到相同的均衡极限环。混合多个LLM智能体生成的FCM不仅能吸收主要成分的均衡点，还能创造新的均衡点，从而更好地近似基础因果动态系统。这表明该方法能有效提取因果结构。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了LLM智能体能够从文本中半自主地提取因果FCM结构，形成具有反馈机制的动态系统。FCM的均衡状态驱动LLM的文本处理，两者相互影响。混合多个LLM生成的FCM能进一步改进对因果系统的建模。这一框架为自动化因果推理和复杂系统建模提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: We design a large-language-model (LLM) agent that extracts causal feedback fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) from raw text. The causal learning or extraction process is agentic both because of the LLM's semi-autonomy and because ultimately the FCM dynamical system's equilibria drive the LLM agents to fetch and process causal text. The fetched text can in principle modify the adaptive FCM causal structure and so modify the source of its quasi-autonomy--its equilibrium limit cycles and fixed-point attractors. This bidirectional process endows the evolving FCM dynamical system with a degree of autonomy while still staying on its agentic leash. We show in particular that a sequence of three finely tuned system instructions guide an LLM agent as it systematically extracts key nouns and noun phrases from text, as it extracts FCM concept nodes from among those nouns and noun phrases, and then as it extracts or infers partial or fuzzy causal edges between those FCM nodes. We test this FCM generation on a recent essay about the promise of AI from the late diplomat and political theorist Henry Kissinger and his colleagues. This three-step process produced FCM dynamical systems that converged to the same equilibrium limit cycles as did the human-generated FCMs even though the human-generated FCM differed in the number of nodes and edges. A final FCM mixed generated FCMs from separate Gemini and ChatGPT LLM agents. The mixed FCM absorbed the equilibria of its dominant mixture component but also created new equilibria of its own to better approximate the underlying causal dynamical system.

Abstract: We present Mortar, a system for autonomously evolving game mechanics for automatic game design. Game mechanics define the rules and interactions that govern gameplay, and designing them manually is a time-consuming and expert-driven process. Mortar combines a quality-diversity algorithm with a large language model to explore a diverse set of mechanics, which are evaluated by synthesising complete games that incorporate both evolved mechanics and those drawn from an archive. The mechanics are evaluated by composing complete games through a tree search procedure, where the resulting games are evaluated by their ability to preserve a skill-based ordering over players -- that is, whether stronger players consistently outperform weaker ones. We assess the mechanics based on their contribution towards the skill-based ordering score in the game. We demonstrate that Mortar produces games that appear diverse and playable, and mechanics that contribute more towards the skill-based ordering score in the game. We perform ablation studies to assess the role of each system component and a user study to evaluate the games based on human feedback.

Motivation: 中小型企业普遍缺乏部署高级优化方法的能力，传统LLM直接作为端到端求解器存在'幻觉税'问题——无法进行扎实的概率推理，导致性能显著下降。需要探索新的架构让非专业人员能够利用严格的运筹学方法。

Method: 1. 提出混合智能框架，严格分离语义推理与数学计算：LLM作为智能接口负责自然语言参数提取和结果解释，自动调用精确算法构建优化引擎。2. 引入人类模仿器——模拟有限理性管理者的'数字孪生'系统，用于进行可扩展、可复现的压力测试，应对现实管理对话中的模糊性和不一致性。

Result: 1. 混合智能框架相比使用GPT-4o作为端到端求解器的交互基线，总库存成本降低了32.1%。2. 仅提供完美真实信息并不能改善GPT-4o的性能，证实瓶颈本质上是计算而非信息问题。3. 建立了LLM作为自然语言接口而非运筹学替代品的定位。

Conclusion: LLM不应取代运筹学方法，而应作为自然语言接口，使非专家用户能够访问基于严格求解器的策略。语义推理与数学计算的分离架构是解决LLM在优化任务中'幻觉税'问题的有效途径，为中小型企业提供了实用的库存管理解决方案。

Abstract: Inventory management remains a challenge for many small and medium-sized businesses that lack the expertise to deploy advanced optimization methods. This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can help bridge this gap. We show that employing LLMs as direct, end-to-end solvers incurs a significant "hallucination tax": a performance gap arising from the model's inability to perform grounded stochastic reasoning. To address this, we propose a hybrid agentic framework that strictly decouples semantic reasoning from mathematical calculation. In this architecture, the LLM functions as an intelligent interface, eliciting parameters from natural language and interpreting results while automatically calling rigorous algorithms to build the optimization engine.
  To evaluate this interactive system against the ambiguity and inconsistency of real-world managerial dialogue, we introduce the Human Imitator, a fine-tuned "digital twin" of a boundedly rational manager that enables scalable, reproducible stress-testing. Our empirical analysis reveals that the hybrid agentic framework reduces total inventory costs by 32.1% relative to an interactive baseline using GPT-4o as an end-to-end solver. Moreover, we find that providing perfect ground-truth information alone is insufficient to improve GPT-4o's performance, confirming that the bottleneck is fundamentally computational rather than informational. Our results position LLMs not as replacements for operations research, but as natural-language interfaces that make rigorous, solver-based policies accessible to non-experts.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit persistent logical failures in complex reasoning due to the lack of an internal axiomatic framework. We propose Mathesis, a neuro-symbolic architecture that encodes mathematical states as higher-order hypergraphs and uses a Symbolic Reasoning Kernel (SRK)--a differentiable logic engine that maps constraints to a continuous energy landscape. By defining a global energy function E(G), where zero energy implies logical consistency, the SRK yields gradient-based signals to train a Hypergraph Transformer Brain, turning proof search into energy minimization. Multi-step deduction is enabled via Monte Carlo Tree Search and Evolutionary Proof Search, guided by learned value functions and semantic unification.

Abstract: This paper compares three methodological categories of neural reasoning: LLM reasoning, supervised learning-based reasoning, and explicit model-based reasoning. LLMs remain unreliable and struggle with simple decision-making that animals can master without extensive corpora training. Through disjunctive syllogistic reasoning testing, we show that reasoning via supervised learning is less appealing than reasoning via explicit model construction. Concretely, we show that an Euler Net trained to achieve 100.00% in classic syllogistic reasoning can be trained to reach 100.00% accuracy in disjunctive syllogistic reasoning. However, the retrained Euler Net suffers severely from catastrophic forgetting (its performance drops to 6.25% on already-learned classic syllogistic reasoning), and its reasoning competence is limited to the pattern level. We propose a new version of Sphere Neural Networks that embeds concepts as circles on the surface of an n-dimensional sphere. These Sphere Neural Networks enable the representation of the negation operator via complement circles and achieve reliable decision-making by filtering out illogical statements that form unsatisfiable circular configurations. We demonstrate that the Sphere Neural Network can master 16 syllogistic reasoning tasks, including rigorous disjunctive syllogistic reasoning, while preserving the rigour of classical syllogistic reasoning. We conclude that neural reasoning with explicit model construction is the most reliable among the three methodological categories of neural reasoning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: LLM-empowered agents can exhibit not only demographic bias (e.g., gender, religion) but also intergroup bias triggered by minimal "us" versus "them" cues. When this intergroup boundary aligns with an agent-human divide, the risk shifts from disparities among human demographic groups to a more fundamental group-level asymmetry, i.e., humans as a whole may be treated as the outgroup by agents. To examine this possibility, we construct a controlled multi-agent social simulation based on allocation decisions under explicit payoff trade-offs and find that agents exhibit a consistent intergroup bias under minimal group cues. Although this bias is attenuated when some counterparts are framed as humans, we attribute the attenuation to an implicit human-norm script that favors humans yet activates only when the agent believes a real human is present. This belief dependence creates a new attack surface. We therefore introduce a Belief Poisoning Attack (BPA) that corrupts persistent identity beliefs to suppress the human-norm script and reactivate outgroup bias toward humans, instantiated as profile poisoning at initialization (BPA-PP) and memory poisoning via optimized belief-refinement suffixes injected into stored reflections (BPA-MP). Finally, we discuss practical mitigation strategies for hardening current agent frameworks against BPA, highlighting feasible interventions at profile and memory boundaries. Extensive experiments demonstrate both the existence of agent intergroup bias and the severity of BPA across settings. Our goal in identifying these vulnerabilities is to inform safer agent design, not to enable real-world exploitation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Clinical trial failure remains a central bottleneck in drug development, where minor protocol design flaws can irreversibly compromise outcomes despite promising therapeutics. Although cutting-edge AI methods achieve strong performance in predicting trial success, they are inherently reactive for merely diagnosing risk without offering actionable remedies once failure is anticipated. To fill this gap, this paper proposes ClinicalReTrial, a self-evolving AI agent framework that addresses this gap by casting clinical trial reasoning as an iterative protocol redesign problem. Our method integrates failure diagnosis, safety-aware modification, and candidate evaluation in a closed-loop, reward-driven optimization framework. Serving the outcome prediction model as a simulation environment, ClinicalReTrial enables low-cost evaluation of protocol modifications and provides dense reward signals for continuous self-improvement. To support efficient exploration, the framework maintains hierarchical memory that captures iteration-level feedback within trials and distills transferable redesign patterns across trials. Empirically, ClinicalReTrial improves 83.3% of trial protocols with a mean success probability gain of 5.7%, and retrospective case studies demonstrate strong alignment between the discovered redesign strategies and real-world clinical trial modifications.

Conclusion: ACCD为社交平台协调行为检测提供了更准确、高效且高度自动化的端到端解决方案，具有重要实践价值和广泛应用前景。

Abstract: Detecting coordinated inauthentic behavior on social media remains a critical and persistent challenge, as most existing approaches rely on superficial correlation analysis, employ static parameter settings, and demand extensive and labor-intensive manual annotation. To address these limitations systematically, we propose the Adaptive Causal Coordination Detection (ACCD) framework. ACCD adopts a three-stage, progressive architecture that leverages a memory-guided adaptive mechanism to dynamically learn and retain optimal detection configurations for diverse coordination scenarios. Specifically, in the first stage, ACCD introduces an adaptive Convergent Cross Mapping (CCM) technique to deeply identify genuine causal relationships between accounts. The second stage integrates active learning with uncertainty sampling within a semi-supervised classification scheme, significantly reducing the burden of manual labeling. The third stage deploys an automated validation module driven by historical detection experience, enabling self-verification and optimization of the detection outcomes. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation using real-world datasets, including the Twitter IRA dataset, Reddit coordination traces, and several widely-adopted bot detection benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that ACCD achieves an F1-score of 87.3\% in coordinated attack detection, representing a 15.2\% improvement over the strongest existing baseline. Furthermore, the system reduces manual annotation requirements by 68\% and achieves a 2.8x speedup in processing through hierarchical clustering optimization. In summary, ACCD provides a more accurate, efficient, and highly automated end-to-end solution for identifying coordinated behavior on social platforms, offering substantial practical value and promising potential for broad application.

Abstract: This paper explores how semantic-space reasoning, traditionally used in computational linguistics, can be extended to tactical decision-making in team sports. Building on the analogy between texts and teams -- where players act as words and collective play conveys meaning -- the proposed methodology models tactical configurations as compositional semantic structures. Each player is represented as a multidimensional vector integrating technical, physical, and psychological attributes; team profiles are aggregated through contextual weighting into a higher-level semantic representation. Within this shared vector space, tactical templates such as high press, counterattack, or possession build-up are encoded analogously to linguistic concepts. Their alignment with team profiles is evaluated using vector-distance metrics, enabling the computation of tactical ``fit'' and opponent-exploitation potential. A Python-based prototype demonstrates how these methods can generate interpretable, dynamically adaptive strategy recommendations, accompanied by fine-grained diagnostic insights at the attribute level. Beyond football, the approach offers a generalizable framework for collective decision-making and performance optimization in team-based domains -- ranging from basketball and hockey to cooperative robotics and human-AI coordination systems. The paper concludes by outlining future directions toward real-world data integration, predictive simulation, and hybrid human-machine tactical intelligence.

*Liv G. d'Aliberti,Manoel Horta Ribeiro*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究发现推理模型中的中间推理转变（如DeepSeek-R1-Zero被观察到的“顿悟”时刻）实际上是推理不稳定的表现，而非有效的自我修正机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前研究表明某些推理模型会在推理过程中出现突然的转变，并导致准确输出，暗示模型具备内在自我修正能力。但尚不清楚这种内在推理策略的转变是否能真正提升性能。

Method: 研究分析了超过100万个推理轨迹、数百个训练检查点，涵盖三个推理领域、多种解码温度和模型架构，检测中间推理转变，并基于不确定性分析人工触发外在转变。

Result: 发现推理转变很罕见，不随训练变得更频繁，且很少提升准确性，表明它们并非真正的“模型洞察”。但在高不确定性（熵）下人工触发外在转变能可靠提高准确率。

Conclusion: 中间推理转变是推理不稳定的症状而非内在自我修正机制，在高不确定性下人工干预可能提升模型性能。

Abstract: Do reasoning models have "Aha!" moments? Prior work suggests that models like DeepSeek-R1-Zero undergo sudden mid-trace realizations that lead to accurate outputs, implying an intrinsic capacity for self-correction. Yet, it remains unclear whether such intrinsic shifts in reasoning strategy actually improve performance. Here, we study mid-reasoning shifts and instrument training runs to detect them. Our analysis spans 1M+ reasoning traces, hundreds of training checkpoints, three reasoning domains, and multiple decoding temperatures and model architectures. We find that reasoning shifts are rare, do not become more frequent with training, and seldom improve accuracy, indicating that they do not correspond to prior perceptions of model insight. However, their effect varies with model uncertainty. Building on this finding, we show that artificially triggering extrinsic shifts under high entropy reliably improves accuracy. Our results show that mid-reasoning shifts are symptoms of unstable inference behavior rather than an intrinsic mechanism for self-correction.

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has shown strong potential for mitigating hallucinations in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, existing multimodal DPO approaches often suffer from overfitting due to the difficulty imbalance in preference data. Our analysis shows that MLLMs tend to overemphasize easily distinguishable preference pairs, which hinders fine-grained hallucination suppression and degrades overall performance. To address this issue, we propose Difficulty-Aware Direct Preference Optimization (DA-DPO), a cost-effective framework designed to balance the learning process. DA-DPO consists of two main components: (1) Difficulty Estimation leverages pre-trained vision--language models with complementary generative and contrastive objectives, whose outputs are integrated via a distribution-aware voting strategy to produce robust difficulty scores without additional training; and (2) Difficulty-Aware Training reweights preference pairs based on their estimated difficulty, down-weighting easy samples while emphasizing harder ones to alleviate overfitting. This framework enables more effective preference optimization by prioritizing challenging examples, without requiring new data or extra fine-tuning stages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DA-DPO consistently improves multimodal preference optimization, yielding stronger robustness to hallucinations and better generalization across standard benchmarks, while remaining computationally efficient.

Abstract: Existing paradigms for inferring pedestrian crossing behavior, ranging from statistical models to supervised learning methods, demonstrate limited generalizability and perform inadequately on new sites. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a shift from numerical pattern fitting to semantic, context-aware behavioral reasoning, yet existing LLM applications lack domain-specific adaptation and visual context. This study introduces Pedestrian Crossing LLM (PedX-LLM), a vision-and-knowledge enhanced framework designed to transform pedestrian crossing inference from site-specific pattern recognition to generalizable behavioral reasoning. By integrating LLaVA-extracted visual features with textual data and transportation domain knowledge, PedX-LLM fine-tunes a LLaMA-2-7B foundation model via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to infer crossing decisions. PedX-LLM achieves 82.0% balanced accuracy, outperforming the best statistical and supervised learning methods. Results demonstrate that the vision-augmented module contributes a 2.9% performance gain by capturing the built environment and integrating domain knowledge yields an additional 4.1% improvement. To evaluate generalizability across unseen environments, cross-site validation was conducted using site-based partitioning. The zero-shot PedX-LLM configuration achieves 66.9% balanced accuracy on five unseen test sites, outperforming the baseline data-driven methods by at least 18 percentage points. Incorporating just five validation examples via few-shot learning to PedX-LLM further elevates the balanced accuracy to 72.2%. PedX-LLM demonstrates strong generalizability to unseen scenarios, confirming that vision-and-knowledge-enhanced reasoning enables the model to mimic human-like decision logic and overcome the limitations of purely data-driven methods.

TL;DR: AgenticDomiKnowS (ADS) 是一个通过智能体工作流将自由格式任务描述自动转换为完整 DomiKnowS 程序的新框架，旨在消除用户对库特定语法的依赖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将符号约束集成到深度学习模型中可以提高其鲁棒性、可解释性和数据效率，但这仍然是一项耗时且具有挑战性的任务。现有的 DomiKnowS 框架虽然提供了高级声明式编程接口，但仍要求用户精通该库的特定语法，这限制了其易用性。

Method: ADS 采用智能体工作流，将自由格式的任务描述逐组件地创建并测试，最终生成完整的 DomiKnowS 程序。该方法支持可选的人工干预（human-in-the-loop），熟悉 DomiKnowS 的用户可以在这个过程中对中间输出进行微调。

Result: 实验表明，ADS 能够帮助有经验的 DomiKnowS 用户和非用户快速构建神经符号程序，将开发时间从数小时缩短至 10-15 分钟。

Conclusion: AgenticDomiKnowS (ADS) 通过消除对 DomiKnowS 库语法的依赖，使得更多用户能够高效地将符号约束集成到深度学习模型中，从而提高了开发效率并降低了使用门槛。

Abstract: Integrating symbolic constraints into deep learning models could make them more robust, interpretable, and data-efficient. Still, it remains a time-consuming and challenging task. Existing frameworks like DomiKnowS help this integration by providing a high-level declarative programming interface, but they still assume the user is proficient with the library's specific syntax. We propose AgenticDomiKnowS (ADS) to eliminate this dependency. ADS translates free-form task descriptions into a complete DomiKnowS program using an agentic workflow that creates and tests each DomiKnowS component separately. The workflow supports optional human-in-the-loop intervention, enabling users familiar with DomiKnowS to refine intermediate outputs. We show how ADS enables experienced DomiKnowS users and non-users to rapidly construct neuro-symbolic programs, reducing development time from hours to 10-15 minutes.

Conclusion: 该研究成功地将精确修复方案从Reed-Solomon码扩展到Reed-Muller码，为更广泛的分布式存储系统家族提供了故障恢复解决方案，特别是针对多变量多项式基础的存储系统。

Abstract: A distributed storage system stores data across multiple nodes, with the primary objective of enabling efficient data recovery even in the event of node failures. The main goal of an exact repair scheme is to recover the data from a failed node by accessing and downloading information from the rest of the nodes. In a groundbreaking paper, ~\cite{GW} developed an exact repair scheme for a distributed storage system that is based on Reed-Solomon codes, which depend on single-variable polynomials. In these notes, we extend the repair scheme to the family of distributed storage systems based on Reed-Muller codes, which are linear codes based on multivariate polynomials. The repair scheme we propose repairs any single node failure and multiple node failures, provided the positions satisfy certain conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统gNB中心的mMIMO架构在高速移动和动态信道下难以满足低时延高可靠需求，需要重新定义用户设备角色，使其从被动收发器转变为主动参与系统性能优化的实体

Method: 通过分析3GPP Release 15-19的标准化演进，系统性回顾UE功能从基础CSI上报到AI/ML增强CSI和UE自主波束管理的进展，并评估多面板架构、设备智能处理、能效优化等技术挑战和架构创新

Result: 数字孪生仿真验证了UE中心化功能的优势：UE自主波束上报在移动场景下提升吞吐量，多面板架构相比单面板UE增强了链路鲁棒性

Conclusion: 从5G到6G的演进中，UE正通过更智能的本地处理、自主决策和多面板架构等创新，在标准化、设备实现和系统架构层面发挥越来越重要的作用

Abstract: As wireless networks continue to evolve, stringent latency and reliability requirements and highly dynamic channels expose fundamental limitations of gNB-centric massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) architectures, motivating a rethinking of the user equipment (UE) role. In response, the UE is transitioning from a passive transceiver into an active entity that directly contributes to system-level performance. In this context, this article examines the evolving role of the UE in mMIMO systems during the transition from fifth-generation (5G) to sixth-generation (6G), bridging third generation partnership project (3GPP) standardization, device implementation, and architectural innovation. Through a chronological review of 3GPP Releases 15 to 19, we highlight the progression of UE functionalities from basic channel state information (CSI) reporting to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)-based CSI enhancement and UE-initiated beam management. We further examine key implementation challenges, including multi-panel UE (MPUE) architectures, on-device intelligent processing, and energy-efficient operation, and then discuss corresponding architectural innovations under practical constraints. Using digital-twin-based evaluations, we validate the impact of emerging UE-centric functionalities, illustrating that UE-initiated beam reporting improves throughput in realistic mobility scenarios, while a multi-panel architecture enhances link robustness compared with a single-panel UE.

TL;DR: 针对卫星通信链路预算不足的问题，论文提出了一种基于语义传输的卫星通信框架，引入了语义效率指标，并开发了决策辅助REINFORCE++算法来优化传输模式选择、卫星-用户关联等参数。

Motivation: 现有的卫星直接接入通信面临着链路预算不足的瓶颈问题。传统通信方式难以在有限的链路预算下实现高效的信息传输，需要一种能更好平衡通信、计算和生成质量的创新解决方案。

Conclusion: 论文成功开发了一个语义传输框架来解决卫星通信中的链路预算瓶颈问题。通过引入语义效率指标和设计的REINFORCE++算法，能够有效优化传输模式选择、卫星-用户关联等关键参数，为未来卫星通信系统提供了有前景的技术方向。

Abstract: Insufficient link budget has become a bottleneck problem for direct access in current satellite communications. In this paper, we develop a semantic transmission framework for direct satellite communications as an effective and viable solution to tackle this problem. To measure the tradeoffs between communication, computation, and generation quality, we introduce a semantic efficiency metric with optimized weights. The optimization aims to maximize the average semantic efficiency metric by jointly optimizing transmission mode selection, satellite-user association, ISL task migration, denoising steps, and adaptive weights, which is a complex nonlinear integer programming problem. To maximize the average semantic efficiency metric, we propose a decision-assisted REINFORCE++ algorithm that utilizes feasibility-aware action space and a critic-free stabilized policy update. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm achieves higher semantic efficiency than baselines.

Abstract: We define and study burst-covering codes. We provide some general bounds connecting the code parameters with its burst-covering radius. We then provide stronger bounds on the burst-covering radius of cyclic codes, by employing linear-feedback shift-register (LFSR) sequences. For the case of BCH codes we prove a new bound on pattern frequencies in LFSR sequences, which is of independent interest. Using this tool, we can bound the covering-radius of binary primitive BCH codes and Melas codes. We conclude with an efficient algorithm for burst-covering cyclic codes.

TL;DR: 本文研究通用离群值假设检验问题，提出两种测试方法：基于均值的测试适用于离群序列数量亚线性增长；当离群序列数量与总序列数量成比例时，采用基于中位数的测试可获得近似最大似然测试的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常假设观测序列数量固定或离群序列数量恒定，本文考虑了更实际的场景：观测序列总数和离群序列数量都随序列长度增长，这使得典型分布π的估计更具挑战性。

Method: 1. 当离群序列数量亚线性增长时，通过计算所有观测序列的均值来估计π，提出基于均值的检测方法；
2. 当离群序列数量与总序列成比例时，使用所有观测序列的中位数来估计π，提出基于中位数的检测方法；
3. 为量化后一种情况，引入了典型错误指数这一概念。

Result: 1. 基于均值的测试能达到已知π和μ的最大似然测试的错误指数；
2. 基于中位数的测试仅能以概率趋近于1达到最大似然测试的错误指数；
3. 两种方法在不同场景下都能有效处理离群值检测，特别是在缺乏先验分布知识的情况下。

Conclusion: 本文证明在通用离群值假设检验中，通过选择合适的统计量（均值或中位数）来估计未知的典型分布π，可以在不同离群序列比例下达到接近最优的检测性能，为缺乏分布先验知识的离群检测问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Universal outlier hypothesis testing refers to a hypothesis testing problem where one observes a large number of length-$n$ sequences -- the majority of which are distributed according to the typical distribution $π$ and a small number are distributed according to the outlier distribution $μ$ -- and one wishes to decide, which of these sequences are outliers without having knowledge of $π$ and $μ$. In contrast to previous works, in this paper it is assumed that both the number of observation sequences and the number of outlier sequences grow with the sequence length. In this case, the typical distribution $π$ can be estimated by computing the mean over all observation sequences, provided that the number of outlier sequences is sublinear in the total number of sequences. It is demonstrated that, in this case, one can achieve the error exponent of the maximum likelihood test that has access to both $π$ and $μ$. However, this mean-based test performs poorly when the number of outlier sequences is proportional to the total number of sequences. For this case, a median-based test is proposed that estimates $π$ as the median of all observation sequences. It is demonstrated that the median-based test achieves again the error exponent of the maximum likelihood test that has access to both $π$ and $μ$, but only with probability approaching one. To formalize this case, the typical error exponent -- similar to the typical random coding exponent introduced in the context of random coding for channel coding -- is proposed.

Abstract: As the transition from 5G to 6G unfolds, a substantial increase in Internet of Things (IoT) devices is expected, enabling seamless and pervasive connectivity across various applications. Accommodating this surge and meeting the high capacity demands will necessitate the integration of NonTerrestrial Networks (NTNs). However, the extensive coverage area of satellites, relative to terrestrial receivers, will lead to a high density of users attempting to access the channel at the same time, increasing the collision probability. In turn, the deployment of mega constellations make it possible for ground users to be in visibility of more than one satellite at the same time, enabling receiver diversity. Therefore, in this paper, we evaluate the impact of multi-receivers in scenarios where IoT nodes share the channel following a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)irregular repetition slotted ALOHA (IRSA) protocol. Considering the impairments of satellite channels, we derive a lower bound of system performance, serving as a fast tool for initial evaluation of network behavior. Additionally, we identify the trade-offs inherent to the network design parameters, with a focus on packet loss rate and energy efficiency. Notably, in the visibility of only one extra satellite as receiver yields significant gains in overall system performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前对基于LLM的多智能体系统在多维度的测试、可靠性和可观测性方面缺乏标准化的评估工具，导致系统行为的不确定性和性能波动难以量化分析。

Method: MAESTRO 通过统一接口标准化多智能体系统的配置与执行，支持原生及第三方系统集成，通过适配器输出框架无关的执行跟踪和系统级信号（如延迟、成本与故障）。研究实例化12个具有代表性的多智能体系统，并进行了重复运行、后端模型和工具配置等多方面的对照实验。

Result: 多智能体系统执行在结构上稳定但在时间上存在明显波动，导致运行间的性能和可靠性差异较大。研究发现多智能体系统架构是影响资源分配、可复现性以及成本-延迟-准确性权衡的主要因素，通常比后端模型或工具设置的变化更重要。

Conclusion: MAESTRO 能够进行系统化评估，并能为多智能体系统的设计、优化提供实证指导；后续需要在更多平台和任务上进行扩展验证。

Abstract: We present MAESTRO, an evaluation suite for the testing, reliability, and observability of LLM-based MAS. MAESTRO standardizes MAS configuration and execution through a unified interface, supports integrating both native and third-party MAS via a repository of examples and lightweight adapters, and exports framework-agnostic execution traces together with system-level signals (e.g., latency, cost, and failures). We instantiate MAESTRO with 12 representative MAS spanning popular agentic frameworks and interaction patterns, and conduct controlled experiments across repeated runs, backend models, and tool configurations. Our case studies show that MAS executions can be structurally stable yet temporally variable, leading to substantial run-to-run variance in performance and reliability. We further find that MAS architecture is the dominant driver of resource profiles, reproducibility, and cost-latency-accuracy trade-off, often outweighing changes in backend models or tool settings. Overall, MAESTRO enables systematic evaluation and provides empirical guidance for designing and optimizing agentic systems.
