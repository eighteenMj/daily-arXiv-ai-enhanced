Abstract: Connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs) rely on vision-based deep neural networks (DNNs) and low-latency (Vehicle-to-Everything) V2X communication to navigate safely and efficiently. Despite their advances, these systems remain vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce PHANTOM (PHysical ANamorphic Threats Obstructing connected vehicle Mobility), a novel framework for crafting and deploying perspective-dependent adversarial examples using \textit{anamorphic art}. PHANTOM exploits geometric distortions that appear natural to humans but are misclassified with high confidence by state-of-the-art object detectors. Unlike conventional attacks, PHANTOM operates in black-box settings without model access and demonstrates strong transferability across four diverse detector architectures (YOLOv5, SSD, Faster R-CNN, and RetinaNet). Comprehensive evaluation in CARLA across varying speeds, weather conditions, and lighting scenarios shows that PHANTOM achieves over 90\% attack success rate under optimal conditions and maintains 60-80\% effectiveness even in degraded environments. The attack activates within 6-10 meters of the target, providing insufficient time for safe maneuvering. Beyond individual vehicle deception, PHANTOM triggers network-wide disruption in CAV systems: SUMO-OMNeT++ co-simulation demonstrates that false emergency messages propagate through V2X links, increasing Peak Age of Information by 68-89\% and degrading safety-critical communication. These findings expose critical vulnerabilities in both perception and communication layers of CAV ecosystems.

*Jungwoo Kim,Jun-Hyuk Kim,Jong-Seok Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了PICM-Net，一种基于三值平面编码的渐进式学习图像压缩方法，专门针对机器感知设计，支持细粒度可扩展性，并引入自适应解码控制器来动态调整解码级别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的学习图像编码器主要针对人类感知设计，虽然已经扩展到机器感知，但在具有细粒度可扩展性（FGS）的渐进式图像压缩方面仍是空白，特别是在机器感知导向的编码器上。

Method: 基于三值平面编码技术，分析了人类感知和机器感知在率失真优先级上的差异，系统性地研究了面向机器的潜在编码优先级策略。设计了一个自适应解码控制器，在推理时动态确定必要的解码级别以维持下游机器预测的置信度。

Result: 广泛的实验表明，该方法实现了高效和自适应的渐进传输，同时在下游分类任务中保持了高性能，为机器感知的渐进式图像压缩建立了新范式。

Conclusion: PICM-Net为机器感知的渐进式图像压缩提供了一个有效的解决方案，通过自适应解码机制实现了对下游任务性能的优化，推动了机器感知压缩领域的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in learned image codecs have been extended from human perception toward machine perception. However, progressive image compression with fine granular scalability (FGS)-which enables decoding a single bitstream at multiple quality levels-remains unexplored for machine-oriented codecs. In this work, we propose a novel progressive learned image compression codec for machine perception, PICM-Net, based on trit-plane coding. By analyzing the difference between human- and machine-oriented rate-distortion priorities, we systematically examine the latent prioritization strategies in terms of machine-oriented codecs. To further enhance real-world adaptability, we design an adaptive decoding controller, which dynamically determines the necessary decoding level during inference time to maintain the desired confidence of downstream machine prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach enables efficient and adaptive progressive transmission while maintaining high performance in the downstream classification task, establishing a new paradigm for machine-aware progressive image compression.

Abstract: Deteriorating civil infrastructure requires automated inspection techniques overcoming limitations of visual assessment. While Ground Penetrating Radar and Infrared Thermography enable subsurface defect detection, single modal approaches face complementary constraints radar struggles with moisture and shallow defects, while thermography exhibits weather dependency and limited depth. This paper presents a multi modal attention network fusing radar temporal patterns with thermal spatial signatures for bridge deck delamination detection. Our architecture introduces temporal attention for radar processing, spatial attention for thermal features, and cross modal fusion with learnable embeddings discovering complementary defect patterns invisible to individual sensors. We incorporate uncertainty quantification through Monte Carlo dropout and learned variance estimation, decomposing uncertainty into epistemic and aleatoric components for safety critical decisions. Experiments on five bridge datasets reveal that on balanced to moderately imbalanced data, our approach substantially outperforms baselines in accuracy and AUC representing meaningful improvements over single modal and concatenation based fusion. Ablation studies demonstrate cross modal attention provides critical gains beyond within modality attention, while multi head mechanisms achieve improved calibration. Uncertainty quantification reduces calibration error, enabling selective prediction by rejecting uncertain cases. However, under extreme class imbalance, attention mechanisms show vulnerability to majority class collapse. These findings provide actionable guidance: attention based architecture performs well across typical scenarios, while extreme imbalance requires specialized techniques. Our system maintains deployment efficiency, enabling real time inspection with characterized capabilities and limitations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Focus is a cornerstone of photography, yet autofocus systems often fail to capture the intended subject, and users frequently wish to adjust focus after capture. We introduce a novel method for realistic post-capture refocusing using video diffusion models. From a single defocused image, our approach generates a perceptually accurate focal stack, represented as a video sequence, enabling interactive refocusing and unlocking a range of downstream applications. We release a large-scale focal stack dataset acquired under diverse real-world smartphone conditions to support this work and future research. Our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in both perceptual quality and robustness across challenging scenarios, paving the way for more advanced focus-editing capabilities in everyday photography.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Most existing image compression approaches perform transform coding in the pixel space to reduce its spatial redundancy. However, they encounter difficulties in achieving both high-realism and high-fidelity at low bitrate, as the pixel-space distortion may not align with human perception. To address this issue, we introduce a Generative Latent Coding (GLC) architecture, which performs transform coding in the latent space of a generative vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE), instead of in the pixel space. The generative latent space is characterized by greater sparsity, richer semantic and better alignment with human perception, rendering it advantageous for achieving high-realism and high-fidelity compression. Additionally, we introduce a categorical hyper module to reduce the bit cost of hyper-information, and a code-prediction-based supervision to enhance the semantic consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our GLC maintains high visual quality with less than 0.04 bpp on natural images and less than 0.01 bpp on facial images. On the CLIC2020 test set, we achieve the same FID as MS-ILLM with 45% fewer bits. Furthermore, the powerful generative latent space enables various applications built on our GLC pipeline, such as image restoration and style transfer. The code is available at https://github.com/jzyustc/GLC.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We revisit the problem of assigning a score (a quality of fit) to candidate geometric models -- one of the key components of RANSAC for robust geometric fitting. In a non-robust setting, the ``gold standard'' scoring function, known as the geometric error, follows from a probabilistic model with Gaussian noises. We extend it to spherical noises. In a robust setting, we consider a mixture with uniformly distributed outliers and show that a threshold-based parameterization leads to a unified view of likelihood-based and robust M-estimators and associated local optimization schemes.
  Next we analyze MAGSAC++ which stands out for two reasons. First, it achieves the best results according to existing benchmarks. Second, it makes quite different modeling assumptions and derivation steps. We discovered, however that the derivation does not correspond to sound principles and the resulting score function is in fact numerically equivalent to a simple Gaussian-uniform likelihood, a basic model within the proposed framework.
  Finally, we propose an experimental methodology for evaluating scoring functions: assuming either a large validation set, or a small random validation set in expectation. We find that all scoring functions, including using a learned inlier distribution, perform identically. In particular, MAGSAC++ score is found to be neither better performing than simple contenders nor less sensitive to the choice of the threshold hyperparameter.
  Our theoretical and experimental analysis thus comprehensively revisit the state-of-the-art, which is critical for any future research seeking to improve the methods or apply them to other robust fitting problems.

### [7] [HyGE-Occ: Hybrid View-Transformation with 3D Gaussian and Edge Priors for 3D Panoptic Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19871)
*Jong Wook Kim,Wonseok Roh,Ha Dam Baek,Pilhyeon Lee,Jonghyun Choi,Sangpil Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HyGE-Occ利用混合视图变换分支结合3D高斯和边缘先验，提升3D全景占据预测的几何一致性与边界感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂环境中难以保持精确的3D几何并捕捉实例的空间范围，影响了全景分离的鲁棒性。

Method: 采用混合视图变换分支，融合连续高斯深度表示与离散深度桶表示以提升BEV特征的几何一致性；同时从BEV特征提取边缘图作为辅助线索学习边界信息。

Result: 在Occ3D-nuScenes数据集上，HyGE-Occ优于现有方法，展现了卓越的3D几何推理能力。

Conclusion: 通过引入高斯和边缘先验的混合方法，HyGE-Occ在3D全景占据预测任务中实现了更好的几何一致性与边界感知性能。

Abstract: 3D Panoptic Occupancy Prediction aims to reconstruct a dense volumetric scene map by predicting the semantic class and instance identity of every occupied region in 3D space. Achieving such fine-grained 3D understanding requires precise geometric reasoning and spatially consistent scene representation across complex environments. However, existing approaches often struggle to maintain precise geometry and capture the precise spatial range of 3D instances critical for robust panoptic separation. To overcome these limitations, we introduce HyGE-Occ, a novel framework that leverages a hybrid view-transformation branch with 3D Gaussian and edge priors to enhance both geometric consistency and boundary awareness in 3D panoptic occupancy prediction. HyGE-Occ employs a hybrid view-transformation branch that fuses a continuous Gaussian-based depth representation with a discretized depth-bin formulation, producing BEV features with improved geometric consistency and structural coherence. In parallel, we extract edge maps from BEV features and use them as auxiliary information to learn edge cues. In our extensive experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset, HyGE-Occ outperforms existing work, demonstrating superior 3D geometric reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DAMP框架解决统一高光谱图像恢复中依赖显式降级先验的问题，通过空间-频谱降级指标作为降级提示，结合空间-频谱自适应模块和混合专家架构实现自适应恢复


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的统一高光谱图像恢复方法通常依赖于显式降级先验作为提示，但在实际场景中，复杂混合的降级使得这些先验难以获取

Method: 提出降级感知度量提示框架：1）设计空间-频谱降级指标连续量化多维降级作为降级提示；2）引入空间-频谱自适应模块动态调制特征提取；3）集成到混合专家架构中，利用降级提示作为门控路由

Result: 在自然和遥感高光谱数据集上的广泛实验表明，DAMP实现了最先进的性能，并展示了卓越的泛化能力

Conclusion: DAMP框架通过量化降级指标作为提示，结合自适应模块和混合专家架构，能够在多样、混合或未见降级下实现高效、鲁棒的高光谱图像恢复

Abstract: Unified hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration aims to recover various degraded HSIs using a single model, offering great practical value. However, existing methods often depend on explicit degradation priors (e.g., degradation labels) as prompts to guide restoration, which are difficult to obtain due to complex and mixed degradations in real-world scenarios. To address this challenge, we propose a Degradation-Aware Metric Prompting (DAMP) framework. Instead of relying on predefined degradation priors, we design spatial-spectral degradation metrics to continuously quantify multi-dimensional degradations, serving as Degradation Prompts (DP). These DP enable the model to capture cross-task similarities in degradation distributions and enhance shared feature learning. Furthermore, we introduce a Spatial-Spectral Adaptive Module (SSAM) that dynamically modulates spatial and spectral feature extraction through learnable parameters. By integrating SSAM as experts within a Mixture-of-Experts architecture, and using DP as the gating router, the framework enables adaptive, efficient, and robust restoration under diverse, mixed, or unseen degradations. Extensive experiments on natural and remote sensing HSI datasets show that DAMP achieves state-of-the-art performance and demonstrates exceptional generalization capability.

TL;DR: 该研究关注从用户界面到代码（UI2Code）中的Widget-to-Code任务，针对紧凑、上下文无关的微界面（widget）缺少标记数据的问题，提出一个图像基准和端到端解决方案WidgetFactory，在视觉保真度和跨平台代码生成能力上取得显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有UI2Code研究主要关注网页和移动界面，而widget作为紧凑、无上下文的微界面，其设计私有且缺乏可访问的标记数据，导致该领域研究不足。

Method: 提出WidgetFactory端到端框架：在感知层面，基于widget设计原则将原子组件组装为完整布局，配备图标检索和可重用可视化模块；在系统层面，设计框架无关的WidgetDSL领域特定语言及编译器，可生成多种前端实现（如React、HTML/CSS），并通过自适应渲染模块优化空间维度。

Result: 基准测试显示，当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）虽优于专门的UI2Code方法，但仍产生不可靠且视觉不一致的代码。WidgetFactory显著提升了视觉保真度，并为未来研究提供了统一的基础设施。

Conclusion: 该研究为Widget2Code领域建立了标准基准和强大基线，通过结构化代码生成和端到端基础设施解决了widget代码生成的独特挑战，推动了该方向的研究发展。

Abstract: User interface to code (UI2Code) aims to generate executable code that can faithfully reconstruct a given input UI. Prior work focuses largely on web pages and mobile screens, leaving app widgets underexplored. Unlike web or mobile UIs with rich hierarchical context, widgets are compact, context-free micro-interfaces that summarize key information through dense layouts and iconography under strict spatial constraints. Moreover, while (image, code) pairs are widely available for web or mobile UIs, widget designs are proprietary and lack accessible markup. We formalize this setting as the Widget-to-Code (Widget2Code) and introduce an image-only widget benchmark with fine-grained, multi-dimensional evaluation metrics. Benchmarking shows that although generalized multimodal large language models (MLLMs) outperform specialized UI2Code methods, they still produce unreliable and visually inconsistent code. To address these limitations, we develop a baseline that jointly advances perceptual understanding and structured code generation. At the perceptual level, we follow widget design principles to assemble atomic components into complete layouts, equipped with icon retrieval and reusable visualization modules. At the system level, we design an end-to-end infrastructure, WidgetFactory, which includes a framework-agnostic widget-tailored domain-specific language (WidgetDSL) and a compiler that translates it into multiple front-end implementations (e.g., React, HTML/CSS). An adaptive rendering module further refines spatial dimensions to satisfy compactness constraints. Together, these contributions substantially enhance visual fidelity, establishing a strong baseline and unified infrastructure for future Widget2Code research.

TL;DR: TAVID框架首次将互动人脸与对话语音的联合生成统一起来，通过跨模态映射器实现视听模态的互补信息交换，在真人对话的真实性、响应性、流畅性和语音质量上均表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常孤立地研究说话或倾听头部生成以及对话语音生成，忽视了人类对话的多模态特性（涉及紧密耦合的视听交互），因此需要开发能同步生成互动人脸和对话语音的统一框架。

Method: 提出TAVID统一框架，通过两个跨模态映射器（运动映射器和说话者映射器）整合人脸和语音生成流程，实现音频和视觉模态之间互补信息的双向交换。

Result: 在四个维度（说话人脸真实性、倾听头部响应性、二人互动流畅性、语音质量）上的广泛实验证明了该方法在所有方面的有效性。

Conclusion: TAVID成功实现了从文本和参考图像同步生成互动视频和对话语音，为构建更人性化的对话系统迈出了重要一步，证明了跨模态信息交换在生成协调的多模态对话内容中的价值。

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to jointly synthesize interactive videos and conversational speech from text and reference images. With the ultimate goal of building human-like conversational systems, recent studies have explored talking or listening head generation as well as conversational speech generation. However, these works are typically studied in isolation, overlooking the multimodal nature of human conversation, which involves tightly coupled audio-visual interactions. In this paper, we introduce TAVID, a unified framework that generates both interactive faces and conversational speech in a synchronized manner. TAVID integrates face and speech generation pipelines through two cross-modal mappers (i.e., a motion mapper and a speaker mapper), which enable bidirectional exchange of complementary information between the audio and visual modalities. We evaluate our system across four dimensions: talking face realism, listening head responsiveness, dyadic interaction fluency, and speech quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across all these aspects.

TL;DR: NeurAlign是一个深度学习框架，通过统一的体积-表面表示联合对齐3D脑MRI图像的皮层和皮层下区域，解决了传统方法分离处理导致不一致性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的脑MRI配准方法将体积和表面配准分开处理，导致不一致性，限制了后续分析。需要一个能统一对齐皮层和皮层下区域的配准方法。

Method: NeurAlign利用中间球面坐标空间桥接解剖表面拓扑与体积解剖结构，通过集成球面配准到学习中，确保体积和表面域之间的几何一致性。它只需要MRI扫描，无需额外输入。

Result: 在域内和域外数据集上，NeurAlign均优于传统和基于机器学习的配准方法——将Dice分数提高最多7个点，同时保持规则的变形场。它比标准方法快几个数量级。

Conclusion: NeurAlign以优异的准确性、快速推理和易用性，为联合皮层和皮层下配准设定了新标准。

Abstract: Accurate registration of brain MRI scans is fundamental for cross-subject analysis in neuroscientific studies. This involves aligning both the cortical surface of the brain and the interior volume. Traditional methods treat volumetric and surface-based registration separately, which often leads to inconsistencies that limit downstream analyses. We propose a deep learning framework, NeurAlign, that registers $3$D brain MRI images by jointly aligning both cortical and subcortical regions through a unified volume-and-surface-based representation. Our approach leverages an intermediate spherical coordinate space to bridge anatomical surface topology with volumetric anatomy, enabling consistent and anatomically accurate alignment. By integrating spherical registration into the learning, our method ensures geometric coherence between volume and surface domains. In a series of experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, our method consistently outperforms both classical and machine learning-based registration methods -- improving the Dice score by up to 7 points while maintaining regular deformation fields. Additionally, it is orders of magnitude faster than the standard method for this task, and is simpler to use because it requires no additional inputs beyond an MRI scan. With its superior accuracy, fast inference, and ease of use, NeurAlign sets a new standard for joint cortical and subcortical registration.

Abstract: While instruction-based image editing is emerging, extending it to 360$^\circ$ panoramas introduces additional challenges. Existing methods often produce implausible results in both equirectangular projections (ERP) and perspective views. To address these limitations, we propose SE360, a novel framework for multi-condition guided object editing in 360$^\circ$ panoramas. At its core is a novel coarse-to-fine autonomous data generation pipeline without manual intervention. This pipeline leverages a Vision-Language Model (VLM) and adaptive projection adjustment for hierarchical analysis, ensuring the holistic segmentation of objects and their physical context. The resulting data pairs are both semantically meaningful and geometrically consistent, even when sourced from unlabeled panoramas. Furthermore, we introduce a cost-effective, two-stage data refinement strategy to improve data realism and mitigate model overfitting to erase artifacts. Based on the constructed dataset, we train a Transformer-based diffusion model to allow flexible object editing guided by text, mask, or reference image in 360$^\circ$ panoramas. Our experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and semantic accuracy.

Motivation: 研究旨在探索在大规模视频数据上训练的视频基础模型是否能自然习得3D理解能力，这有助于验证模型的可扩展性和理解视频数据的本质。

Method: 作者提出了首个模型无关的评估框架，通过浅层读出机制从不同视频基础模型的编码特征中估计多种3D属性，实现3D感知能力的量化测量。

Conclusion: 研究结果为构建可扩展的3D模型提供了重要见解，说明视频数据本身蕴含丰富的3D信息，为未来3D模型的发展指明了方向。

Abstract: Videos are continuous 2D projections of 3D worlds. After training on large video data, will global 3D understanding naturally emerge? We study this by quantifying the 3D understanding of existing Video Foundation Models (VidFMs) pretrained on vast video data. We propose the first model-agnostic framework that measures the 3D awareness of various VidFMs by estimating multiple 3D properties from their features via shallow read-outs. Our study presents meaningful findings regarding the 3D awareness of VidFMs on multiple axes. In particular, we show that state-of-the-art video generation models exhibit a strong understanding of 3D objects and scenes, despite not being trained on any 3D data. Such understanding can even surpass that of large expert models specifically trained for 3D tasks. Our findings, together with the 3D benchmarking of major VidFMs, provide valuable observations for building scalable 3D models.

Abstract: High-throughput "pathomic" analysis of Whole Slide Images (WSIs) offers new opportunities to study tissue characteristics and for biomarker discovery. However, the clinical relevance of the tissue characteristics at the micro- and macro-environment level is limited by the lack of tools that facilitate the measurement of the spatial interaction of individual structure characteristics and their association with clinical parameters. To address these challenges, we introduce HistoWAS (Histology-Wide Association Study), a computational framework designed to link tissue spatial organization to clinical outcomes. Specifically, HistoWAS implements (1) a feature space that augments conventional metrics with 30 topological and spatial features, adapted from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) point pattern analysis, to quantify tissue micro-architecture; and (2) an association study engine, inspired by Phenome-Wide Association Studies (PheWAS), that performs mass univariate regression for each feature with statistical correction. As a proof of concept, we applied HistoWAS to analyze a total of 102 features (72 conventional object-level features and our 30 spatial features) using 385 PAS-stained WSIs from 206 participants in the Kidney Precision Medicine Project (KPMP). The code and data have been released to https://github.com/hrlblab/histoWAS.

Abstract: As a significant agricultural country, Bangladesh utilizes its fertile land for guava cultivation and dedicated labor to boost its economic development. In a nation like Bangladesh, enhancing guava production and agricultural practices plays a crucial role in its economy. Anthracnose and fruit fly infection can lower the quality and productivity of guava, a crucial tropical fruit. Expert systems that detect diseases early can reduce losses and safeguard the harvest. Images of guava fruits classified into the Healthy, Fruit Flies, and Anthracnose classes are included in the Guava Fruit Disease Dataset 2024 (GFDD24), which comes from plantations in Rajshahi and Pabna, Bangladesh. This study aims to create models using CNN alongside traditional machine learning techniques that can effectively identify guava diseases in locally cultivated varieties in Bangladesh. In order to achieve the highest classification accuracy of approximately 99.99% for the guava dataset, we propose utilizing ensemble models that combine CNNML with Gradient Boosting Machine. In general, the CNN-ML cascade framework exhibits strong, high-accuracy guava disease detection that is appropriate for real-time agricultural monitoring systems.

TL;DR: DDTM是一个用于跨分辨率土地覆盖映射的双分支弱监督框架，通过扩散和Transformer分支分别处理局部语义细化和全局上下文一致性，提升粗糙监督下的高分辨率预测质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的弱监督方法在跨分辨率土地覆盖映射中难以对齐细粒度空间结构与粗糙标签，导致噪声监督和映射精度下降。为了解决分辨率严重不匹配带来的挑战，需要更有效的学习框架。

Method: 1. 提出DDTM双分支弱监督框架。2. 扩散分支在粗糙监督下渐进细化精细尺度的局部语义。3. Transformer分支强制执行大空间范围内的长距离上下文一致性。4. 设计伪标签置信度评估模块，减轻跨分辨率不一致性带来的噪声，选择性利用可靠的监督信号。

Conclusion: DDTM通过解耦局部语义细化和全局上下文推理，有效解决了跨分辨率土地覆盖映射中的监督噪声问题，在弱监督土地覆盖映射任务上实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Cross-resolution land cover mapping aims to produce high-resolution semantic predictions from coarse or low-resolution supervision, yet the severe resolution mismatch makes effective learning highly challenging. Existing weakly supervised approaches often struggle to align fine-grained spatial structures with coarse labels, leading to noisy supervision and degraded mapping accuracy. To tackle this problem, we propose DDTM, a dual-branch weakly supervised framework that explicitly decouples local semantic refinement from global contextual reasoning. Specifically, DDTM introduces a diffusion-based branch to progressively refine fine-scale local semantics under coarse supervision, while a transformer-based branch enforces long-range contextual consistency across large spatial extents. In addition, we design a pseudo-label confidence evaluation module to mitigate noise induced by cross-resolution inconsistencies and to selectively exploit reliable supervisory signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDTM establishes a new state-of-the-art on the Chesapeake Bay benchmark, achieving 66.52\% mIoU and substantially outperforming prior weakly supervised methods.

Abstract: Automated pavement defect detection often struggles to generalize across diverse real-world conditions due to the lack of standardized datasets. Existing datasets differ in annotation styles, distress type definitions, and formats, limiting their integration for unified training. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark dataset that consolidates multiple publicly available sources into a standardized collection of 52747 images from seven countries, with 135277 bounding box annotations covering 13 distinct distress types. The dataset captures broad real-world variation in image quality, resolution, viewing angles, and weather conditions, offering a unique resource for consistent training and evaluation. Its effectiveness was demonstrated through benchmarking with state-of-the-art object detection models including YOLOv8-YOLOv12, Faster R-CNN, and DETR, which achieved competitive performance across diverse scenarios. By standardizing class definitions and annotation formats, this dataset provides the first globally representative benchmark for pavement defect detection and enables fair comparison of models, including zero-shot transfer to new environments.

Abstract: Effectively grounding complex language to pixels in remote sensing (RS) images is a critical challenge for applications like disaster response and environmental monitoring. Current models can parse simple, single-target commands but fail when presented with complex geospatial scenarios, e.g., segmenting objects at various granularities, executing multi-target instructions, and interpreting implicit user intent. To drive progress against these failures, we present LaSeRS, the first large-scale dataset built for comprehensive training and evaluation across four critical dimensions of language-guided segmentation: hierarchical granularity, target multiplicity, reasoning requirements, and linguistic variability. By capturing these dimensions, LaSeRS moves beyond simple commands, providing a benchmark for complex geospatial reasoning. This addresses a critical gap: existing datasets oversimplify, leading to sensitivity-prone real-world models. We also propose SegEarth-R2, an MLLM architecture designed for comprehensive language-guided segmentation in RS, which directly confronts these challenges. The model's effectiveness stems from two key improvements: (1) a spatial attention supervision mechanism specifically handles the localization of small objects and their components, and (2) a flexible and efficient segmentation query mechanism that handles both single-target and multi-target scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our SegEarth-R2 achieves outstanding performance on LaSeRS and other benchmarks, establishing a powerful baseline for the next generation of geospatial segmentation. All data and code will be released at https://github.com/earth-insights/SegEarth-R2.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了将道路视角与驾驶员视角结合是否能改善分心驾驶检测，发现性能提升取决于模型架构设计，简单的多视角组合可能反而导致准确率下降。


<details>

Motivation: 现有分心驾驶检测模型主要依赖驾驶员视角，忽略了环境影响驾驶行为的重要上下文信息。研究旨在探讨结合道路视角是否能提高自然驾驶条件下的分心检测准确率。

Method: 使用同步双摄像头采集的真实驾驶数据，对比了三种时空行为识别架构（SlowFast-R50、X3D-M、SlowOnly-R50）在单视角（仅驾驶员）和双视角（驾驶员+道路）输入配置下的性能。

Result: SlowOnly-R50在双视角输入下获得了9.8%的性能提升，而双路径的SlowFast-R50反而准确率下降了7.2%。这表明显著性能提升需要特定的架构设计支持多视角融合。

Conclusion: 简单地添加视觉上下文并不足够，可能会导致干扰；需要专门支持多视角融合的架构设计。这是首个使用自然驾驶数据对单双视角分心检测模型的系统比较，强调了融合感知设计对未来多模态驾驶员监测系统的重要性。

Abstract: Despite increasing interest in computer vision-based distracted driving detection, most existing models rely exclusively on driver-facing views and overlook crucial environmental context that influences driving behavior. This study investigates whether incorporating road-facing views alongside driver-facing footage improves distraction detection accuracy in naturalistic driving conditions. Using synchronized dual-camera recordings from real-world driving, we benchmark three leading spatiotemporal action recognition architectures: SlowFast-R50, X3D-M, and SlowOnly-R50. Each model is evaluated under two input configurations: driver-only and stacked dual-view. Results show that while contextual inputs can improve detection in certain models, performance gains depend strongly on the underlying architecture. The single-pathway SlowOnly model achieved a 9.8 percent improvement with dual-view inputs, while the dual-pathway SlowFast model experienced a 7.2 percent drop in accuracy due to representational conflicts. These findings suggest that simply adding visual context is not sufficient and may lead to interference unless the architecture is specifically designed to support multi-view integration. This study presents one of the first systematic comparisons of single- and dual-view distraction detection models using naturalistic driving data and underscores the importance of fusion-aware design for future multimodal driver monitoring systems.

Abstract: Graph neural networks are increasingly applied to multimodal medical diagnosis for their inherent relational modeling capabilities. However, their efficacy is often compromised by the prevailing reliance on a single, static graph built from indiscriminate features, hindering the ability to model patient-specific pathological relationships. To this end, the proposed Multi-Activation Plane Interaction Graph Neural Network (MAPI-GNN) reconstructs this single-graph paradigm by learning a multifaceted graph profile from semantically disentangled feature subspaces. The framework first uncovers latent graph-aware patterns via a multi-dimensional discriminator; these patterns then guide the dynamic construction of a stack of activation graphs; and this multifaceted profile is finally aggregated and contextualized by a relational fusion engine for a robust diagnosis. Extensive experiments on two diverse tasks, comprising over 1300 patient samples, demonstrate that MAPI-GNN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen state-object compositions by generalizing from a training set of their primitives (state and object). Current methods often overlook the rich hierarchical structures, such as the semantic hierarchy of primitives (e.g., apple fruit) and the conceptual hierarchy between primitives and compositions (e.g, sliced apple apple). A few recent efforts have shown effectiveness in modeling these hierarchies through loss regularization within Euclidean space. In this paper, we argue that they fail to scale to the large-scale taxonomies required for real-world CZSL: the space's polynomial volume growth in flat geometry cannot match the exponential structure, impairing generalization capacity. To this end, we propose H2em, a new framework that learns Hierarchical Hyperbolic EMbeddings for CZSL. H2em leverages the unique properties of hyperbolic geometry, a space naturally suited for embedding tree-like structures with low distortion. However, a naive hyperbolic mapping may suffer from hierarchical collapse and poor fine-grained discrimination. We further design two learning objectives to structure this space: a Dual-Hierarchical Entailment Loss that uses hyperbolic entailment cones to enforce the predefined hierarchies, and a Discriminative Alignment Loss with hard negative mining to establish a large geodesic distance between semantically similar compositions. Furthermore, we devise Hyperbolic Cross-Modal Attention to realize instance-aware cross-modal infusion within hyperbolic geometry. Extensive ablations on three benchmarks demonstrate that H2em establishes a new state-of-the-art in both closed-world and open-world scenarios. Our codes will be released.

Conclusion: VALLR-Pin通过多任务学习、大语言模型纠错和针对性微调，协同整合视觉特征与语音语言上下文，显著改善了普通话视觉语音识别的准确性

Abstract: Visual Speech Recognition aims to transcribe spoken words from silent lip-motion videos. This task is particularly challenging for Mandarin, as visemes are highly ambiguous and homophones are prevalent. We propose VALLR-Pin, a novel two-stage framework that extends the recent VALLR architecture from English to Mandarin. First, a shared video encoder feeds into dual decoders, which jointly predict both Chinese character sequences and their standard Pinyin romanization. The multi-task learning of character and phonetic outputs fosters robust visual-semantic representations. During inference, the text decoder generates multiple candidate transcripts. We construct a prompt by concatenating the Pinyin output with these candidate Chinese sequences and feed it to a large language model to resolve ambiguities and refine the transcription. This provides the LLM with explicit phonetic context to correct homophone-induced errors. Finally, we fine-tune the LLM on synthetic noisy examples: we generate imperfect Pinyin-text pairs from intermediate VALLR-Pin checkpoints using the training data, creating instruction-response pairs for error correction. This endows the LLM with awareness of our model's specific error patterns. In summary, VALLR-Pin synergizes visual features with phonetic and linguistic context to improve Mandarin lip-reading performance.

Motivation: 现有的唇形同步系统通常需要显式的掩码控制，计算量大且实时性不足。FlashLips旨在开发一个无需掩码、实时高效、视觉质量与传统大模型相当的系统，解决现有方法在速度和部署上的限制。

Method: 第一阶段：设计一个基于重建损失的紧凑一步潜空间编辑器，使用参考身份、掩码目标帧和低维唇部姿态向量重构图像。通过自监督生成嘴部变体作为伪标签进行微调，实现无掩码推理。第二阶段：采用基于流匹配的音频到姿态transformer预测唇部姿态向量。形成确定性重建与音频控制的稳定pipeline。

Conclusion: FlashLips实现了唇形同步系统的实时化，通过解耦控制和渲染、自监督学习和流匹配等技术，在保持高质量的同时显著提升速度，适用于实际部署。

Abstract: We present FlashLips, a two-stage, mask-free lip-sync system that decouples lips control from rendering and achieves real-time performance running at over 100 FPS on a single GPU, while matching the visual quality of larger state-of-the-art models. Stage 1 is a compact, one-step latent-space editor that reconstructs an image using a reference identity, a masked target frame, and a low-dimensional lips-pose vector, trained purely with reconstruction losses - no GANs or diffusion. To remove explicit masks at inference, we use self-supervision: we generate mouth-altered variants of the target image, that serve as pseudo ground truth for fine-tuning, teaching the network to localize edits to the lips while preserving the rest. Stage 2 is an audio-to-pose transformer trained with a flow-matching objective to predict lips-poses vectors from speech. Together, these stages form a simple and stable pipeline that combines deterministic reconstruction with robust audio control, delivering high perceptual quality and faster-than-real-time speed.

Abstract: Real-world image captions often lack contextual depth, omitting crucial details such as event background, temporal cues, outcomes, and named entities that are not visually discernible. This gap limits the effectiveness of image understanding in domains like journalism, education, and digital archives, where richer, more informative descriptions are essential. To address this, we propose a multimodal pipeline that augments visual input with external textual knowledge. Our system retrieves semantically similar images using BEIT-3 (Flickr30k-384 and COCO-384) and SigLIP So-384, reranks them using ORB and SIFT for geometric alignment, and extracts contextual information from related articles via semantic search. A fine-tuned Qwen3 model with QLoRA then integrates this context with base captions generated by Instruct BLIP (Vicuna-7B) to produce event-enriched, context-aware descriptions. Evaluated on the OpenEvents v1 dataset, our approach generates significantly more informative captions compared to traditional methods, showing strong potential for real-world applications requiring deeper visual-textual understanding

Abstract: Generating realistic and diverse LiDAR point clouds is crucial for autonomous driving simulation. Although previous methods achieve LiDAR point cloud generation from user inputs, they struggle to attain high-quality results while enabling versatile controllability, due to the imbalance between the complex distribution of LiDAR point clouds and the simple control signals. To address the limitation, we propose LiDARDraft, which utilizes the 3D layout to build a bridge between versatile conditional signals and LiDAR point clouds. The 3D layout can be trivially generated from various user inputs such as textual descriptions and images. Specifically, we represent text, images, and point clouds as unified 3D layouts, which are further transformed into semantic and depth control signals. Then, we employ a rangemap-based ControlNet to guide LiDAR point cloud generation. This pixel-level alignment approach demonstrates excellent performance in controllable LiDAR point clouds generation, enabling "simulation from scratch", allowing self-driving environments to be created from arbitrary textual descriptions, images and sketches.

Abstract: Audio-Visual Segmentation (AVS) aims to localize sound-producing objects at the pixel level by jointly leveraging auditory and visual information. However, existing methods often suffer from multi-source entanglement and audio-visual misalignment, which lead to biases toward louder or larger objects while overlooking weaker, smaller, or co-occurring sources. To address these challenges, we propose DDAVS, a Disentangled Audio Semantics and Delayed Bidirectional Alignment framework. To mitigate multi-source entanglement, DDAVS employs learnable queries to extract audio semantics and anchor them within a structured semantic space derived from an audio prototype memory bank. This is further optimized through contrastive learning to enhance discriminability and robustness. To alleviate audio-visual misalignment, DDAVS introduces dual cross-attention with delayed modality interaction, improving the robustness of multimodal alignment. Extensive experiments on the AVS-Objects and VPO benchmarks demonstrate that DDAVS consistently outperforms existing approaches, exhibiting strong performance across single-source, multi-source, and multi-instance scenarios. These results validate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our framework under challenging real-world audio-visual segmentation conditions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) deliver state-of-the-art accuracy but their quadratic attention cost and redundant computations severely hinder deployment on latency and resource-constrained platforms. Existing pruning approaches treat either tokens or heads in isolation, relying on heuristics or first-order signals, which often sacrifice accuracy or fail to generalize across inputs. We introduce HEART-ViT, a Hessian-guided efficient dynamic attention and token pruning framework for vision transformers, which to the best of our knowledge is the first unified, second-order, input-adaptive framework for ViT optimization. HEART-ViT estimates curvature-weighted sensitivities of both tokens and attention heads using efficient Hessian-vector products, enabling principled pruning decisions under explicit loss budgets.This dual-view sensitivity reveals an important structural insight: token pruning dominates computational savings, while head pruning provides fine-grained redundancy removal, and their combination achieves a superior trade-off. On ImageNet-100 and ImageNet-1K with ViT-B/16 and DeiT-B/16, HEART-ViT achieves up to 49.4 percent FLOPs reduction, 36 percent lower latency, and 46 percent higher throughput, while consistently matching or even surpassing baseline accuracy after fine-tuning, for example 4.7 percent recovery at 40 percent token pruning. Beyond theoretical benchmarks, we deploy HEART-ViT on different edge devices such as AGX Orin, demonstrating that our reductions in FLOPs and latency translate directly into real-world gains in inference speed and energy efficiency. HEART-ViT bridges the gap between theory and practice, delivering the first unified, curvature-driven pruning framework that is both accuracy-preserving and edge-efficient.

Abstract: Millimeter-wave radar offers a privacy-preserving and lighting-invariant alternative to RGB sensors for Human Pose Estimation (HPE) task. However, the radar signals are often sparse due to specular reflection, making the extraction of robust features from radar signals highly challenging. To address this, we present milliMamba, a radar-based 2D human pose estimation framework that jointly models spatio-temporal dependencies across both the feature extraction and decoding stages. Specifically, given the high dimensionality of radar inputs, we adopt a Cross-View Fusion Mamba encoder to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from longer sequences with linear complexity. A Spatio-Temporal-Cross Attention decoder then predicts joint coordinates across multiple frames. Together, this spatio-temporal modeling pipeline enables the model to leverage contextual cues from neighboring frames and joints to infer missing joints caused by specular reflections. To reinforce motion smoothness, we incorporate a velocity loss alongside the standard keypoint loss during training. Experiments on the TransHuPR and HuPR datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant performance improvements, exceeding the baselines by 11.0 AP and 14.6 AP, respectively, while maintaining reasonable complexity.

Abstract: Automating tasks in orchards is challenging because of the large amount of variation in the environment and occlusions. One of the challenges is apple pose estimation, where key points, such as the calyx, are often occluded. Recently developed pose estimation methods no longer rely on these key points, but still require them for annotations, making annotating challenging and time-consuming. Due to the abovementioned occlusions, there can be conflicting and missing annotations of the same fruit between different images. Novel 3D reconstruction methods can be used to simplify annotating and enlarge datasets. We propose a novel pipeline consisting of 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct an orchard scene, simplified annotations, automated projection of the annotations to images, and the training and evaluation of a pose estimation method. Using our pipeline, 105 manual annotations were required to obtain 28,191 training labels, a reduction of 99.6%. Experimental results indicated that training with labels of fruits that are $\leq95\%$ occluded resulted in the best performance, with a neutral F1 score of 0.927 on the original images and 0.970 on the rendered images. Adjusting the size of the training dataset had small effects on the model performance in terms of F1 score and pose estimation accuracy. It was found that the least occluded fruits had the best position estimation, which worsened as the fruits became more occluded. It was also found that the tested pose estimation method was unable to correctly learn the orientation estimation of apples.

Abstract: Low-shot object counting addresses estimating the number of previously unobserved objects in an image using only few or no annotated test-time exemplars. A considerable challenge for modern low-shot counters are dense regions with small objects. While total counts in such situations are typically well addressed by density-based counters, their usefulness is limited by poor localization capabilities. This is better addressed by point-detection-based counters, which are based on query-based detectors. However, due to limited number of pre-trained queries, they underperform on images with very large numbers of objects, and resort to ad-hoc techniques like upsampling and tiling. We propose CoDi, the first latent diffusion-based low-shot counter that produces high-quality density maps on which object locations can be determined by non-maxima suppression. Our core contribution is the new exemplar-based conditioning module that extracts and adjusts the object prototypes to the intermediate layers of the denoising network, leading to accurate object location estimation. On FSC benchmark, CoDi outperforms state-of-the-art by 15% MAE, 13% MAE and 10% MAE in the few-shot, one-shot, and reference-less scenarios, respectively, and sets a new state-of-the-art on MCAC benchmark by outperforming the top method by 44% MAE.

Abstract: Vision foundation models trained via multi-teacher distillation offer a promising path toward unified visual representations, yet the learning dynamics and data efficiency of such approaches remain underexplored. In this paper, we systematically study multi-teacher distillation for vision foundation models and identify key factors that enable training at lower computational cost. We introduce Agglomerative Mixture-of-Experts Vision Foundation Models (AMoE), which distill knowledge from SigLIP2 and DINOv3 simultaneously into a Mixture-of-Experts student. We show that (1) our Asymmetric Relation-Knowledge Distillation loss preserves the geometric properties of each teacher while enabling effective knowledge transfer, (2) token-balanced batching that packs varying-resolution images into sequences with uniform token budgets stabilizes representation learning across resolutions without sacrificing performance, and (3) hierarchical clustering and sampling of training data--typically reserved for self-supervised learning--substantially improves sample efficiency over random sampling for multi-teacher distillation. By combining these findings, we curate OpenLVD200M, a 200M-image corpus that demonstrates superior efficiency for multi-teacher distillation. Instantiated in a Mixture-of-Experts. We release OpenLVD200M and distilled models.

Abstract: Document image retrieval (DIR) aims to retrieve document images from a gallery according to a given query. Existing DIR methods are primarily based on image queries that retrieve documents within the same coarse semantic category, e.g., newspapers or receipts. However, these methods struggle to effectively retrieve document images in real-world scenarios where textual queries with fine-grained semantics are usually provided. To bridge this gap, we introduce a new Natural Language-based Document Image Retrieval (NL-DIR) benchmark with corresponding evaluation metrics. In this work, natural language descriptions serve as semantically rich queries for the DIR task. The NL-DIR dataset contains 41K authentic document images, each paired with five high-quality, fine-grained semantic queries generated and evaluated through large language models in conjunction with manual verification. We perform zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations of existing mainstream contrastive vision-language models and OCR-free visual document understanding (VDU) models. A two-stage retrieval method is further investigated for performance improvement while achieving both time and space efficiency. We hope the proposed NL-DIR benchmark can bring new opportunities and facilitate research for the VDU community.

The degradations present nonlinear coupling rather than simple superposition, which renders the effective processing of such coupled degradations particularly challenging. Most existing methods focus on designing specific branches, modules, or strategies for specific degradations, with little attention paid to the potential information embedded in their coupling. Consequently, they struggle to effectively capture and process the nonlinear interactions of multiple degradations from a bottom-up perspective. To address this issue, we propose JDPNet, a joint degradation processing network, that mines and unifies the potential information inherent in coupled degradations within a unified framework. Specifically, we introduce a joint feature-mining module, along with a probabilistic bootstrap distribution strategy, to facilitate effective mining and unified adjustment of coupled degradation features. Furthermore, to balance color, clarity, and contrast, we design a novel AquaBalanceLoss to guide the network in learning from multiple coupled degradation losses. Experiments on six publicly available underwater datasets, as well as two new datasets constructed in this study, show that JDPNet exhibits state-of-the-art performance while offering a better tradeoff between performance, parameter size, and computational cost.

Abstract: 3D object detection is fundamental for safe and robust intelligent transportation systems. Current multi-modal 3D object detectors often rely on complex architectures and training strategies to achieve higher detection accuracy. However, these methods heavily rely on the LiDAR sensor so that they suffer from large performance drops when LiDAR is absent, which compromises the robustness and safety of autonomous systems in practical scenarios. Moreover, existing multi-modal detectors face difficulties in deployment on diverse hardware platforms, such as NPUs and FPGAs, due to their reliance on 3D sparse convolution operators, which are primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs. To address these challenges, we reconsider the role of LiDAR in the camera-LiDAR fusion paradigm and introduce a novel multi-modal 3D detector, LiteFusion. Instead of treating LiDAR point clouds as an independent modality with a separate feature extraction backbone, LiteFusion utilizes LiDAR data as a complementary source of geometric information to enhance camera-based detection. This straightforward approach completely eliminates the reliance on a 3D backbone, making the method highly deployment-friendly. Specifically, LiteFusion integrates complementary features from LiDAR points into image features within a quaternion space, where the orthogonal constraints are well-preserved during network training. This helps model domain-specific relations across modalities, yielding a compact cross-modal embedding. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that LiteFusion improves the baseline vision-based detector by +20.4% mAP and +19.7% NDS with a minimal increase in parameters (1.1%) without using dedicated LiDAR encoders. Notably, even in the absence of LiDAR input, LiteFusion maintains strong results , highlighting its favorable robustness and effectiveness across diverse fusion paradigms and deployment scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出IndicDLP数据集，涵盖11种印度语言及英语，解决现有文档布局数据集在细粒度标注、多语言多样性上的不足，特别是印度语言代表性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大规模数据集如PubLayNet、DocBank缺乏细粒度区域标签和多语言多样性；人工标注数据集如M6Doc、D4LA虽有更丰富标签，但规模太小且多语言覆盖不足，而印度语言文档尤其缺乏代表性。

Method: 创建IndicDLP大规模基础文档布局数据集，覆盖11种代表性印度语言和英语，涵盖12个常见文档领域；同时从DocLayNet和M6Doc中构建UED-mini数据集用于增强预训练。

Result: 实验显示，在IndicDLP上微调现有英语模型能显著提升性能；在IndicDLP上训练的模型也能很好地泛化到非印度语言布局。

Conclusion: IndicDLP填补了规模、多样性、标注粒度方面的空白，推动了包容性和高效的文档理解。

Abstract: Document layout analysis is essential for downstream tasks such as information retrieval, extraction, OCR, and digitization. However, existing large-scale datasets like PubLayNet and DocBank lack fine-grained region labels and multilingual diversity, making them insufficient for representing complex document layouts. In contrast, human-annotated datasets such as M6Doc and D4LA offer richer labels and greater domain diversity, but are too small to train robust models and lack adequate multilingual coverage. This gap is especially pronounced for Indic documents, which encompass diverse scripts yet remain underrepresented in current datasets, further limiting progress in this space. To address these shortcomings, we introduce IndicDLP, a large-scale foundational document layout dataset spanning 11 representative Indic languages alongside English and 12 common document domains. Additionally, we curate UED-mini, a dataset derived from DocLayNet and M6Doc, to enhance pretraining and provide a solid foundation for Indic layout models. Our experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning existing English models on IndicDLP significantly boosts performance, validating its effectiveness. Moreover, models trained on IndicDLP generalize well beyond Indic layouts, making it a valuable resource for document digitization. This work bridges gaps in scale, diversity, and annotation granularity, driving inclusive and efficient document understanding.

Abstract: High-resolution remote sensing image semantic segmentation (HRSS) is a fundamental yet critical task in the field of Earth observation. However, it has long faced the challenges of high inter-class similarity and large intra-class variability. Existing approaches often struggle to effectively inject abstract yet strongly discriminative semantic knowledge into pixel-level feature learning, leading to blurred boundaries and class confusion in complex scenes. To address these challenges, we propose Bidirectional Co-Refinement Framework for HRSS (BiCoR-Seg). Specifically, we design a Heatmap-driven Bidirectional Information Synergy Module (HBIS), which establishes a bidirectional information flow between feature maps and class embeddings by generating class-level heatmaps. Based on HBIS, we further introduce a hierarchical supervision strategy, where the interpretable heatmaps generated by each HBIS module are directly utilized as low-resolution segmentation predictions for supervision, thereby enhancing the discriminative capacity of shallow features. In addition, to further improve the discriminability of the embedding representations, we propose a cross-layer class embedding Fisher Discriminative Loss to enforce intra-class compactness and enlarge inter-class separability. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA, Vaihingen, and Potsdam datasets demonstrate that BiCoR-Seg achieves outstanding segmentation performance while offering stronger interpretability.

TL;DR: 研究者提出了LADLE-MM，一种在有限标注数据和计算资源下工作的多模态虚假信息检测器，通过模型集成和多模态嵌入增强，在不同数据集上表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多媒体内容的生成和篡改工具越来越容易获得，现实的多模态合成篡改已成为广泛威胁，被用于歪曲重要事件和传播虚假信息。现有的检测方法通常依赖计算密集型架构或需要大量标注数据，因此需要一种在有限标注和训练资源下仍能有效工作的解决方案。

Method: 设计了LADLE-MM检测器，包含两个单模态分支和一个多模态分支。多模态分支使用BLIP提取的固定多模态嵌入来增强图像和文本表示，作为参考空间。通过模型集成初始化，在减少60.3%可训练参数的同时保持性能。

Conclusion: LADLE-MM证明了在有限标注数据和计算资源下，通过精心设计的多模态表示增强和轻量级架构，可以有效检测多模态虚假信息，且具有优秀的泛化能力和抗偏差能力。

Abstract: With the rise of easily accessible tools for generating and manipulating multimedia content, realistic synthetic alterations to digital media have become a widespread threat, often involving manipulations across multiple modalities simultaneously. Recently, such techniques have been increasingly employed to distort narratives of important events and to spread misinformation on social media, prompting the development of misinformation detectors. In the context of misinformation conveyed through image-text pairs, several detection methods have been proposed. However, these approaches typically rely on computationally intensive architectures or require large amounts of annotated data. In this work we introduce LADLE-MM: Limited Annotation based Detector with Learned Ensembles for Multimodal Misinformation, a model-soup initialized multimodal misinformation detector designed to operate under a limited annotation setup and constrained training resources. LADLE-MM is composed of two unimodal branches and a third multimodal one that enhances image and text representations with additional multimodal embeddings extracted from BLIP, serving as fixed reference space. Despite using 60.3% fewer trainable parameters than previous state-of-the-art models, LADLE-MM achieves competitive performance on both binary and multi-label classification tasks on the DGM4 benchmark, outperforming existing methods when trained without grounding annotations. Moreover, when evaluated on the VERITE dataset, LADLE-MM outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches that utilize more complex architectures involving Large Vision-Language-Models, demonstrating the effective generalization ability in an open-set setting and strong robustness to unimodal bias.

Abstract: Weakly-Supervised Camouflaged Object Detection (WSCOD) aims to locate and segment objects that are visually concealed within their surrounding scenes, relying solely on sparse supervision such as scribble annotations. Despite recent progress, existing WSCOD methods still lag far behind fully supervised ones due to two major limitations: (1) the pseudo masks generated by general-purpose segmentation models (e.g., SAM) and filtered via rules are often unreliable, as these models lack the task-specific semantic understanding required for effective pseudo labeling in COD; and (2) the neglect of inherent annotation bias in scribbles, which hinders the model from capturing the global structure of camouflaged objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks. In the second stage, we design FADeNet, which progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantic understanding with local detail modeling, while dynamically reweighting supervision strength across regions to alleviate scribble bias. By jointly exploiting the supervision signals from both the pseudo masks and scribble semantics, ${D}^{3}$ETOR significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to its widespread adoption across diverse domains, including medical imaging. This progress is driven by increasingly sophisticated model architectures, such as ResNets, Vision Transformers, and Hybrid Convolutional Neural Networks, that offer enhanced performance at the cost of greater complexity. This complexity often compromises model explainability and interpretability. SHAP has emerged as a prominent method for providing interpretable visualizations that aid domain experts in understanding model predictions. However, SHAP explanations can be unstable and unreliable in the presence of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. In this study, we address this challenge by using Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify the uncertainty that arises from these unstable explanations in medical imaging applications. The framework uses a belief, plausible, and fusion map approach alongside statistical quantitative analysis to produce quantification of uncertainty in SHAP. Furthermore, we evaluated our framework on three medical imaging datasets with varying class distributions, image qualities, and modality types which introduces noise due to varying image resolutions and modality-specific aspect covering the examples from pathology, ophthalmology, and radiology, introducing significant epistemic uncertainty.

TL;DR: 提出了基于关键帧的细节注入框架KeyTailor和高质量数据集ViT-HD，用于解决视频虚拟试穿中服装细节动态和背景完整性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散变换器的视频虚拟试穿方法在捕捉服装的细粒度动态和保持跨帧背景一致性方面存在困难，且引入额外交互模块导致计算成本高，同时现有数据集规模和质量限制了模型泛化能力。

Method: 1. 指令引导的关键帧采样策略从输入视频中筛选信息丰富的帧；2. 服装细节增强模块和协作背景优化模块分别从关键帧中提取服装动态到服装相关潜在空间，并优化背景潜在空间的完整性；3. 将这些增强的细节与姿势、掩码和噪声潜变量一同注入标准扩散变换器块中。

Result: 在大规模高清数据集ViT-HD（15,070个810*1080分辨率视频样本）上进行实验表明，KeyTailor在动态和静态场景下，在服装保真度和背景完整性方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: KeyTailor通过关键帧驱动的细节注入策略，在无需显式修改扩散变换器架构的情况下实现了高效且逼真的试穿视频合成，同时避免了额外的计算复杂性。

Abstract: Although diffusion transformer (DiT)-based video virtual try-on (VVT) has made significant progress in synthesizing realistic videos, existing methods still struggle to capture fine-grained garment dynamics and preserve background integrity across video frames. They also incur high computational costs due to additional interaction modules introduced into DiTs, while the limited scale and quality of existing public datasets also restrict model generalization and effective training. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework, KeyTailor, along with a large-scale, high-definition dataset, ViT-HD. The core idea of KeyTailor is a keyframe-driven details injection strategy, motivated by the fact that keyframes inherently contain both foreground dynamics and background consistency. Specifically, KeyTailor adopts an instruction-guided keyframe sampling strategy to filter informative frames from the input video. Subsequently,two tailored keyframe-driven modules, the garment details enhancement module and the collaborative background optimization module, are employed to distill garment dynamics into garment-related latents and to optimize the integrity of background latents, both guided by keyframes.These enriched details are then injected into standard DiT blocks together with pose, mask, and noise latents, enabling efficient and realistic try-on video synthesis. This design ensures consistency without explicitly modifying the DiT architecture, while simultaneously avoiding additional complexity. In addition, our dataset ViT-HD comprises 15, 070 high-quality video samples at a resolution of 810*1080, covering diverse garments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KeyTailor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of garment fidelity and background integrity across both dynamic and static scenarios.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that inference-time reasoning and reflection can improve text-to-image generation without retraining. However, existing approaches often rely on implicit, holistic critiques or unconstrained prompt rewrites, making their behavior difficult to interpret, control, or stop reliably. In contrast, large language models have benefited from explicit, structured forms of **thinking** based on verification, targeted correction, and early stopping.
  We introduce CRAFT (Continuous Reasoning and Agentic Feedback Tuning), a training-free, model-agnostic framework that brings this structured reasoning paradigm to multimodal image generation. CRAFT decomposes a prompt into dependency-structured visual questions, veries generated images using a vision-language model, and applies targeted prompt edits through an LLM agent only where constraints fail. The process iterates with an explicit stopping criterion once all constraints are satised, yielding an interpretable and controllable inference-time renement loop.
  Across multiple model families and challenging benchmarks, CRAFT consistently improves compositional accuracy, text rendering, and preference-based evaluations, with particularly strong gains for lightweight generators. Importantly, these improvements incur only a negligible inference-time overhead, allowing smaller or cheaper models to approach the quality of substantially more expensive systems. Our results suggest that explicitly structured, constraint-driven inference-time reasoning is a key ingredient for improving the reliability of multimodal generative models.

Conclusion: SmartSplat通过创新的采样和优化策略，实现了对超高清图像的高效高质量压缩，为解决生成式AI时代的大规模视觉内容处理提供了有效的技术方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have accelerated the production of ultra-high-resolution visual content, posing significant challenges for efficient compression and real-time decoding on end-user devices. Inspired by 3D Gaussian Splatting, recent 2D Gaussian image models improve representation efficiency, yet existing methods struggle to balance compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity in ultra-high-resolution scenarios. To address this issue, we propose SmartSplat, a highly adaptive and feature-aware GS-based image compression framework that supports arbitrary image resolutions and compression ratios. SmartSplat leverages image-aware features such as gradients and color variances, introducing a Gradient-Color Guided Variational Sampling strategy together with an Exclusion-based Uniform Sampling scheme to improve the non-overlapping coverage of Gaussian primitives in pixel space. In addition, we propose a Scale-Adaptive Gaussian Color Sampling method to enhance color initialization across scales. Through joint optimization of spatial layout, scale, and color initialization, SmartSplat efficiently captures both local structures and global textures using a limited number of Gaussians, achieving high reconstruction quality under strong compression. Extensive experiments on DIV8K and a newly constructed 16K dataset demonstrate that SmartSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods at comparable compression ratios and exceeds their compression limits, showing strong scalability and practical applicability. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/lif314/SmartSplat.

Abstract: Aligning egocentric video with wearable sensors have shown promise for human action recognition, but face practical limitations in user discomfort, privacy concerns, and scalability. We explore exocentric video with ambient sensors as a non-intrusive, scalable alternative. While prior egocentric-wearable works predominantly adopt Global Alignment by encoding entire sequences into unified representations, this approach fails in exocentric-ambient settings due to two problems: (P1) inability to capture local details such as subtle motions, and (P2) over-reliance on modality-invariant temporal patterns, causing misalignment between actions sharing similar temporal patterns with different spatio-semantic contexts. To resolve these problems, we propose DETACH, a decomposed spatio-temporal framework. This explicit decomposition preserves local details, while our novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering provide semantic grounding for context-aware alignment. To align the decomposed features, our two-stage approach establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then performs temporal alignment via a spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles easy negatives, hard negatives, and false negatives. Comprehensive experiments with downstream tasks on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over adapted egocentric-wearable baselines.

Method: 提出Chain-of-Anomaly-Thoughts（CoAT）多智能体推理框架，通过在推理过程中引入归纳性犯罪偏置，并添加专注于异常判别的最终分类层。

Result: 在低分辨率视频上，异常检测F1分数提升11.8个百分点；在高分辨率视频上，异常分类性能提升3.78个百分点。

Conclusion: CoAT框架通过引入异常归纳偏置和多智能体推理机制，显著提升了大型视觉语言模型在视频监控中的异常检测和分类能力。

Abstract: Automated video surveillance with Large Vision-Language Models is limited by their inherent bias towards normality, often failing to detect crimes. While Chain-of-Thought reasoning strategies show significant potential for improving performance in language tasks, the lack of inductive anomaly biases in their reasoning further steers the models towards normal interpretations. To address this, we propose Chain-of-Anomaly-Thoughts (CoAT), a multi-agent reasoning framework that introduces inductive criminal bias in the reasoning process through a final, anomaly-focused classification layer. Our method significantly improves Anomaly Detection, boosting F1-score by 11.8 p.p. on challenging low-resolution footage and Anomaly Classification by 3.78 p.p. in high-resolution videos.

Abstract: Skin cancer can be identified by dermoscopic examination and ocular inspection, but early detection significantly increases survival chances. Artificial intelligence (AI), using annotated skin images and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), improves diagnostic accuracy. This paper presents an early skin cancer classification method using a soft voting ensemble of CNNs. In this investigation, three benchmark datasets, namely HAM10000, ISIC 2016, and ISIC 2019, were used. The process involved rebalancing, image augmentation, and filtering techniques, followed by a hybrid dual encoder for segmentation via transfer learning. Accurate segmentation focused classification models on clinically significant features, reducing background artifacts and improving accuracy. Classification was performed through an ensemble of MobileNetV2, VGG19, and InceptionV3, balancing accuracy and speed for real-world deployment. The method achieved lesion recognition accuracies of 96.32\%, 90.86\%, and 93.92\% for the three datasets. The system performance was evaluated using established skin lesion detection metrics, yielding impressive results.

Conclusion: TBSD方法通过集成纹理基底和平滑分解，有效解决了纹理图像异常检测中的误判和高数据依赖问题，为新一类高维数据异常检测提供了有效的理论和技术框架。

Abstract: In the realm of diverse high-dimensional data, images play a significant role across various processes of manufacturing systems where efficient image anomaly detection has emerged as a core technology of utmost importance. However, when applied to textured defect images, conventional anomaly detection methods have limitations including non-negligible misidentification, low robustness, and excessive reliance on large-scale and structured datasets. This paper proposes a texture basis integrated smooth decomposition (TBSD) approach, which is targeted at efficient anomaly detection in textured images with smooth backgrounds and sparse anomalies. Mathematical formulation of quasi-periodicity and its theoretical properties are investigated for image texture estimation. TBSD method consists of two principal processes: the first process learns the texture basis functions to effectively extract quasi-periodic texture patterns; the subsequent anomaly detection process utilizes that texture basis as prior knowledge to prevent texture misidentification and capture potential anomalies with high accuracy.The proposed method surpasses benchmarks with less misidentification, smaller training dataset requirement, and superior anomaly detection performance on both simulation and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Human motion understanding has advanced rapidly through vision-based progress in recognition, tracking, and captioning. However, most existing methods overlook physical cues such as joint actuation forces that are fundamental in biomechanics. This gap motivates our study: if and when do physically inferred forces enhance motion understanding? By incorporating forces into established motion understanding pipelines, we systematically evaluate their impact across baseline models on 3 major tasks: gait recognition, action recognition, and fine-grained video captioning. Across 8 benchmarks, incorporating forces yields consistent performance gains; for example, on CASIA-B, Rank-1 gait recognition accuracy improved from 89.52% to 90.39% (+0.87), with larger gain observed under challenging conditions: +2.7% when wearing a coat and +3.0% at the side view. On Gait3D, performance also increases from 46.0% to 47.3% (+1.3). In action recognition, CTR-GCN achieved +2.00% on Penn Action, while high-exertion classes like punching/slapping improved by +6.96%. Even in video captioning, Qwen2.5-VL's ROUGE-L score rose from 0.310 to 0.339 (+0.029), indicating that physics-inferred forces enhance temporal grounding and semantic richness. These results demonstrate that force cues can substantially complement visual and kinematic features under dynamic, occluded, or appearance-varying conditions.

Abstract: AI-assisted graphic design has emerged as a powerful tool for automating the creation and editing of design elements such as posters, banners, and advertisements. While diffusion-based text-to-image models have demonstrated strong capabilities in visual content generation, their text rendering performance, particularly for small-scale typography and non-Latin scripts, remains limited. In this paper, we propose UTDesign, a unified framework for high-precision stylized text editing and conditional text generation in design images, supporting both English and Chinese scripts. Our framework introduces a novel DiT-based text style transfer model trained from scratch on a synthetic dataset, capable of generating transparent RGBA text foregrounds that preserve the style of reference glyphs. We further extend this model into a conditional text generation framework by training a multi-modal condition encoder on a curated dataset with detailed text annotations, enabling accurate, style-consistent text synthesis conditioned on background images, prompts, and layout specifications. Finally, we integrate our approach into a fully automated text-to-design (T2D) pipeline by incorporating pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) models and an MLLM-based layout planner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UTDesign achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source methods in terms of stylistic consistency and text accuracy, and also exhibits unique advantages compared to proprietary commercial approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了自适应RGB和长波红外融合技术，用于无人机探测地表地雷。YOLOv11在35,640次模型条件评估中表现最佳，mAP达86.8%；10-30%热融合及5-10米高度为最优参数。架构对比显示RF-DETR准确率最高但训练极慢，存在精度与效率的权衡；多时相训练数据优于季节特定方法；反坦克雷探测准确率远高于反步兵雷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地雷仍是严重的人道主义威胁，全球有1.1亿枚活跃地雷，每年造成2.6万人伤亡。研究旨在利用地雷与周围土壤的热对比度，通过无人机系统结合RGB与长波红外融合技术，提高地表地雷的探测能力。

Method: 使用自适应RGB和长波红外融合技术，采用YOLO架构（v8、v10、v11）在114张测试图像上进行评估（共生成35,640次模型条件评估）。同时比较了RF-DETR、Faster R-CNN、YOLOv11和RetinaNet等架构的性能与训练效率。通过多时相数据集训练模型，并分析不同地雷类型（反坦克雷与反步兵雷）的探测差异。

Result: YOLOv11达到最佳性能（86.8% mAP），最优探测参数为10-30%热融合和5-10米飞行高度。架构对比中RF-DETR准确率最高（69.2% mAP），但YOLOv11训练速度快17.7倍（41分钟 vs 12小时）。多时相训练数据比季节特定方法性能高1.8-9.6%。反坦克雷探测准确率61.9%，反步兵雷仅19.2%。

Conclusion: 自适应热融合能有效提升地表地雷探测性能，YOLOv11在精度与效率间取得了最佳平衡。多时相数据训练能增强模型对多样热条件的适应性。未来研究需量化不同埋藏深度和土壤类型对热对比度的影响。

Abstract: Landmines remain a persistent humanitarian threat, with 110 million actively deployed mines across 60 countries, claiming 26,000 casualties annually. This research evaluates adaptive Red-Green-Blue (RGB) and Long-Wave Infrared (LWIR) fusion for Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)-based detection of surface-laid landmines, leveraging the thermal contrast between the ordnance and the surrounding soil to enhance feature extraction. Using You Only Look Once (YOLO) architectures (v8, v10, v11) across 114 test images, generating 35,640 model-condition evaluations, YOLOv11 achieved optimal performance (86.8% mAP), with 10 to 30% thermal fusion at 5 to 10m altitude identified as the optimal detection parameters. A complementary architectural comparison revealed that while RF-DETR achieved the highest accuracy (69.2% mAP), followed by Faster R-CNN (67.6%), YOLOv11 (64.2%), and RetinaNet (50.2%), YOLOv11 trained 17.7 times faster than the transformer-based RF-DETR (41 minutes versus 12 hours), presenting a critical accuracy-efficiency tradeoff for operational deployment. Aggregated multi-temporal training datasets outperformed season-specific approaches by 1.8 to 9.6%, suggesting that models benefit from exposure to diverse thermal conditions. Anti-Tank (AT) mines achieved 61.9% detection accuracy, compared with 19.2% for Anti-Personnel (AP) mines, reflecting both the size differential and thermal-mass differences between these ordnance classes. As this research examined surface-laid mines where thermal contrast is maximized, future research should quantify thermal contrast effects for mines buried at varying depths across heterogeneous soil types.

Abstract: This manuscript explores multimodal alignment, translation, fusion, and transference to enhance machine understanding of complex inputs. We organize the work into five chapters, each addressing unique challenges in multimodal machine learning.
  Chapter 3 introduces Spatial-Reasoning Bert for translating text-based spatial relations into 2D arrangements between clip-arts. This enables effective decoding of spatial language into visual representations, paving the way for automated scene generation aligned with human spatial understanding.
  Chapter 4 presents a method for translating medical texts into specific 3D locations within an anatomical atlas. We introduce a loss function leveraging spatial co-occurrences of medical terms to create interpretable mappings, significantly enhancing medical text navigability.
  Chapter 5 tackles translating structured text into canonical facts within knowledge graphs. We develop a benchmark for linking natural language to entities and predicates, addressing ambiguities in text extraction to provide clearer, actionable insights.
  Chapter 6 explores multimodal fusion methods for compositional action recognition. We propose a method fusing video frames and object detection representations, improving recognition robustness and accuracy.
  Chapter 7 investigates multimodal knowledge transference for egocentric action recognition. We demonstrate how multimodal knowledge distillation enables RGB-only models to mimic multimodal fusion-based capabilities, reducing computational requirements while maintaining performance.
  These contributions advance methodologies for spatial language understanding, medical text interpretation, knowledge graph enrichment, and action recognition, enhancing computational systems' ability to process complex, multimodal inputs across diverse applications.

Abstract: We introduce SirenPose, a geometry-aware loss formulation that integrates the periodic activation properties of sinusoidal representation networks with keypoint-based geometric supervision, enabling accurate and temporally consistent reconstruction of dynamic 3D scenes from monocular videos. Existing approaches often struggle with motion fidelity and spatiotemporal coherence in challenging settings involving fast motion, multi-object interaction, occlusion, and rapid scene changes. SirenPose incorporates physics inspired constraints to enforce coherent keypoint predictions across both spatial and temporal dimensions, while leveraging high frequency signal modeling to capture fine grained geometric details. We further expand the UniKPT dataset to 600,000 annotated instances and integrate graph neural networks to model keypoint relationships and structural correlations. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including Sintel, Bonn, and DAVIS demonstrate that SirenPose consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. On DAVIS, SirenPose achieves a 17.8 percent reduction in FVD, a 28.7 percent reduction in FID, and a 6.0 percent improvement in LPIPS compared to MoSCA. It also improves temporal consistency, geometric accuracy, user score, and motion smoothness. In pose estimation, SirenPose outperforms Monst3R with lower absolute trajectory error as well as reduced translational and rotational relative pose error, highlighting its effectiveness in handling rapid motion, complex dynamics, and physically plausible reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像融合方法在处理动态范围和焦点深度差异方面存在局限，而现有基于视觉语言模型的方法仅使用粗粒度文本描述，无法捕捉细粒度细节并实现精确的跨模态对齐

Method: 提出MTIF框架：1) 多粒度文本描述分别捕捉细节、结构和语义信息；2) 分层跨模态调制模块；3) 每个粒度级的监督信号；4) 基于显著性的数据增强模块

Result: 在多重曝光和多重焦点图像融合任务上，MTIF始终优于先前的方法

Conclusion: MTIF通过多粒度文本引导和跨模态对齐机制，有效提升了图像融合的质量和语义一致性

Abstract: Image fusion aims to synthesize a single high-quality image from a pair of inputs captured under challenging conditions, such as differing exposure levels or focal depths. A core challenge lies in effectively handling disparities in dynamic range and focus depth between the inputs. With the advent of vision-language models, recent methods incorporate textual descriptions as auxiliary guidance to enhance fusion quality. However, simply incorporating coarse-grained descriptions hampers the understanding of fine-grained details and poses challenges for precise cross-modal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose Multi-grained Text-guided Image Fusion (MTIF), a novel fusion paradigm with three key designs. First, it introduces multi-grained textual descriptions that separately capture fine details, structural cues, and semantic content, guiding image fusion through a hierarchical cross-modal modulation module. Second, it involves supervision signals at each granularity to facilitate alignment between visual and textual features and enhance the utility of auxiliary text. Third, it adopts a saliency-driven enrichment module to augment training data with dense semantic content, further strengthening the cross-modal modulation and alignment. Extensive experiments show that MTIF consistently outperforms previous methods on both multi-exposure and multi-focus image fusion tasks.

TL;DR: FlashVLM是一种文本引导的视觉token选择框架，通过计算图像token与文本嵌入的跨模态相似度来动态压缩视觉输入，在显著减少token数量的情况下保持甚至超越原始模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型处理大量视觉token时存在二次注意力成本和冗余问题，而现有token减少方法要么忽略文本查询，要么依赖不稳定的深度注意力图，在激进剪枝下会导致语义对齐退化。

Method: 通过计算投影图像token与归一化文本嵌入在语言模型空间中的显式跨模态相似度来评估相关性，将其与内在视觉显著性融合，并使用多样性保留分区保留最小但有代表性的背景token来保持全局上下文。

Result: 在相同token预算下，FlashVLM在LLaVA 1.5上剪枝77.8%的视觉token仍能略微超越未剪枝基线，即使在94.4%压缩率下也能保持92.8%的准确率，在14个图像和视频基准测试中实现了最先进的效率-性能权衡。

Conclusion: FlashVLM通过文本引导的动态视觉token选择，实现了超出无损压缩的效果，在保持强大鲁棒性和泛化能力的同时，为主流VLM提供了卓越的效率-性能平衡。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) typically process hundreds or thousands of visual tokens per image or video frame, incurring quadratic attention cost and substantial redundancy. Existing token reduction methods often ignore the textual query or rely on deep attention maps, whose instability under aggressive pruning leads to degraded semantic alignment.
  We propose FlashVLM, a text guided visual token selection framework that dynamically adapts visual inputs to the query. Instead of relying on noisy attention weights, FlashVLM computes an explicit cross modal similarity between projected image tokens and normalized text embeddings in the language model space. This extrinsic relevance is fused with intrinsic visual saliency using log domain weighting and temperature controlled sharpening. In addition, a diversity preserving partition retains a minimal yet representative set of background tokens to maintain global context.
  Under identical token budgets and evaluation protocols, FlashVLM achieves beyond lossless compression, slightly surpassing the unpruned baseline while pruning up to 77.8 percent of visual tokens on LLaVA 1.5, and maintaining 92.8 percent accuracy even under 94.4 percent compression. Extensive experiments on 14 image and video benchmarks demonstrate that FlashVLM delivers state of the art efficiency performance trade offs while maintaining strong robustness and generalization across mainstream VLMs.

Abstract: Simulators can generate virtually unlimited driving data, yet imitation learning policies in simulation still struggle to achieve robust closed-loop performance. Motivated by this gap, we empirically study how misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations and sensor-based student observations can limit the effectiveness of imitation learning. More precisely, experts have significantly higher visibility (e.g., ignoring occlusions) and far lower uncertainty (e.g., knowing other vehicles' actions), making them difficult to imitate reliably. Furthermore, navigational intent (i.e., the route to follow) is under-specified in student models at test time via only a single target point. We demonstrate that these asymmetries can measurably limit driving performance in CARLA and offer practical interventions to address them. After careful modifications to narrow the gaps between expert and student, our TransFuser v6 (TFv6) student policy achieves a new state of the art on all major publicly available CARLA closed-loop benchmarks, reaching 95 DS on Bench2Drive and more than doubling prior performances on Longest6~v2 and Town13. Additionally, by integrating perception supervision from our dataset into a shared sim-to-real pipeline, we show consistent gains on the NAVSIM and Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End driving benchmarks. Our code, data, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/autonomousvision/lead.

Abstract: Point tracking aims to localize corresponding points across video frames, serving as a fundamental task for 4D reconstruction, robotics, and video editing. Existing methods commonly rely on shallow convolutional backbones such as ResNet that process frames independently, lacking temporal coherence and producing unreliable matching costs under challenging conditions. Through systematic analysis, we find that video Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), pre-trained on large-scale real-world videos with spatio-temporal attention, inherently exhibit strong point tracking capability and robustly handle dynamic motions and frequent occlusions. We propose DiTracker, which adapts video DiTs through: (1) query-key attention matching, (2) lightweight LoRA tuning, and (3) cost fusion with a ResNet backbone. Despite training with 8 times smaller batch size, DiTracker achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging ITTO benchmark and matches or outperforms state-of-the-art models on TAP-Vid benchmarks. Our work validates video DiT features as an effective and efficient foundation for point tracking.

Abstract: This paper proposes FedPOD (Proportionally Orchestrated Derivative) for optimizing learning efficiency and communication cost in federated learning among multiple clients. Inspired by FedPIDAvg, we define a round-wise task for FedPOD to enhance training efficiency. FedPIDAvg achieved performance improvement by incorporating the training loss reduction for prediction entropy as weights using differential terms. Furthermore, by modeling data distribution with a Poisson distribution and using a PID controller, it reduced communication costs even in skewed data distribution. However, excluding participants classified as outliers based on the Poisson distribution can limit data utilization. Additionally, PID controller requires the same participants to be maintained throughout the federated learning process as it uses previous rounds' learning information in the current round. In our approach, FedPOD addresses these issues by including participants excluded as outliers, eliminating dependency on previous rounds' learning information, and applying a method for calculating validation loss at each round. In this challenge, FedPOD presents comparable performance to FedPIDAvg in metrics of Dice score, 0.78, 0.71 and 0.72 for WT, ET and TC in average, and projected convergence score, 0.74 in average. Furthermore, the concept of FedPOD draws inspiration from Kubernetes' smallest computing unit, POD, designed to be compatible with Kubernetes auto-scaling. Extending round-wise tasks of FedPOD to POD units allows flexible design by applying scale-out similar to Kubernetes' auto-scaling. This work demonstrated the potentials of FedPOD to enhance federated learning by improving efficiency, flexibility, and performance in metrics.

Abstract: Current video avatar generation methods excel at identity preservation and motion alignment but lack genuine agency, they cannot autonomously pursue long-term goals through adaptive environmental interaction. We address this by introducing L-IVA (Long-horizon Interactive Visual Avatar), a task and benchmark for evaluating goal-directed planning in stochastic generative environments, and ORCA (Online Reasoning and Cognitive Architecture), the first framework enabling active intelligence in video avatars. ORCA embodies Internal World Model (IWM) capabilities through two key innovations: (1) a closed-loop OTAR cycle (Observe-Think-Act-Reflect) that maintains robust state tracking under generative uncertainty by continuously verifying predicted outcomes against actual generations, and (2) a hierarchical dual-system architecture where System 2 performs strategic reasoning with state prediction while System 1 translates abstract plans into precise, model-specific action captions. By formulating avatar control as a POMDP and implementing continuous belief updating with outcome verification, ORCA enables autonomous multi-step task completion in open-domain scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ORCA significantly outperforms open-loop and non-reflective baselines in task success rate and behavioral coherence, validating our IWM-inspired design for advancing video avatar intelligence from passive animation to active, goal-oriented behavior.

<details>

Motivation: 目前多模态大语言模型的空间能力研究大多集中在有限的任务上，缺乏对空间能力层次结构的系统理解。认知科学表明空间能力是从感知到推理和互动的渐进发展过程，但在MLLMs中这一层次结构尚未被充分理解。

Method: 引入SpatialTree层次结构（L1-L4四个级别），构建能力导向的分层基准测试（27个子能力），对大模型进行系统评估。研究监督微调中的迁移动态，并提出抑制不必要思考的自动思考策略来改进RL训练方法。

Result: 评估结果显示明确的层次结构：L1技能基本正交，而高级技能强相关。研究发现L1内部存在负迁移，但低层到高层存在强跨层迁移。简单的自动思考策略能让RL一致提升所有层级性能。

Conclusion: SpatialTree为理解和系统扩展多模态大语言模型的空间能力提供了一个概念验证框架，揭示了空间能力的层次结构和可迁移规律，并提出了有效的改进方法。

Abstract: Cognitive science suggests that spatial ability develops progressively-from perception to reasoning and interaction. Yet in multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), this hierarchy remains poorly understood, as most studies focus on a narrow set of tasks. We introduce SpatialTree, a cognitive-science-inspired hierarchy that organizes spatial abilities into four levels: low-level perception (L1), mental mapping (L2), simulation (L3), and agentic competence (L4). Based on this taxonomy, we construct the first capability-centric hierarchical benchmark, thoroughly evaluating mainstream MLLMs across 27 sub-abilities. The evaluation results reveal a clear structure: L1 skills are largely orthogonal, whereas higher-level skills are strongly correlated, indicating increasing interdependency. Through targeted supervised fine-tuning, we uncover a surprising transfer dynamic-negative transfer within L1, but strong cross-level transfer from low- to high-level abilities with notable synergy. Finally, we explore how to improve the entire hierarchy. We find that naive RL that encourages extensive "thinking" is unreliable: it helps complex reasoning but hurts intuitive perception. We propose a simple auto-think strategy that suppresses unnecessary deliberation, enabling RL to consistently improve performance across all levels. By building SpatialTree, we provide a proof-of-concept framework for understanding and systematically scaling spatial abilities in MLLMs.

TL;DR: 提出SemanticGen方法，在语义空间而非VAE潜在空间生成视频，通过两阶段扩散过程首先生成紧凑的语义特征作为全局布局，再生成VAE潜在特征添加高频细节，以提高收敛速度和计算效率。

Motivation: 现有视频生成模型通常在VAE潜在空间学习视频分布，然后通过VAE解码器映射到像素，这种方法生成高质量视频但收敛速度慢且计算成本高，特别是在生成长视频时更为明显。

Method: 采用两阶段生成过程：第一阶段使用扩散模型生成紧凑的语义视频特征作为全局布局规划；第二阶段使用另一个扩散模型根据语义特征生成VAE潜在特征，最终产生视频输出。这种语义空间生成利用了视频的内在冗余性。

Result: 在语义空间生成相比VAE潜在空间能更快收敛，计算效率更高，特别是在长视频生成中表现优异。实验表明SemanticGen能产生高质量视频，并超越现有最先进方法和强基线。

Conclusion: SemanticGen通过在语义空间进行视频生成的新方法，解决了现有方法收敛慢和计算成本高的问题，特别是在长视频生成中表现出色，为视频生成领域提供了更高效有效的解决方案。

Abstract: State-of-the-art video generative models typically learn the distribution of video latents in the VAE space and map them to pixels using a VAE decoder. While this approach can generate high-quality videos, it suffers from slow convergence and is computationally expensive when generating long videos. In this paper, we introduce SemanticGen, a novel solution to address these limitations by generating videos in the semantic space. Our main insight is that, due to the inherent redundancy in videos, the generation process should begin in a compact, high-level semantic space for global planning, followed by the addition of high-frequency details, rather than directly modeling a vast set of low-level video tokens using bi-directional attention. SemanticGen adopts a two-stage generation process. In the first stage, a diffusion model generates compact semantic video features, which define the global layout of the video. In the second stage, another diffusion model generates VAE latents conditioned on these semantic features to produce the final output. We observe that generation in the semantic space leads to faster convergence compared to the VAE latent space. Our method is also effective and computationally efficient when extended to long video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemanticGen produces high-quality videos and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and strong baselines.

Abstract: We introduce a new class of attitude control laws for rotational systems, which generalizes the use of the Euler axis-angle representation beyond quaternion-based formulations. Using basic Lyapunov's stability theory and the notion of extended $K_{\infty}$ functions, we developed a method for determining and enforcing the global asymptotic stability of the single fixed point of the resulting closed-loop (CL) scheme. In contrast with traditional quaternion-based methods, the proposed generalized axis-angle approach enables greater flexibility in the design of the control law, which is of great utility when employed in combination with a switching scheme whose transition state depends on the angular velocity of the controlled rotational system. Through simulation and real-time experimental results, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. According to the recorded data, in the execution of high-speed tumble-recovery maneuvers, the new method consistently achieves shorter stabilization times and requires lower control effort relative to those corresponding to the quaternion-based and geometric-control methods used as benchmarks.

Abstract: The Heyland circle diagram is a classical graphical tool for representing the steady-state behavior of induction machines using no-load and blocked-rotor test data. While widely used in alternating-current machinery texts, the diagram is typically presented as a hand-constructed aid and lacks a standardized computational formulation. This paper presents HeylandCircle, a computational framework that reconstructs the classical Heyland circle diagram directly from standard test parameters. The framework formalizes the traditional geometric construction as a deterministic, reproducible sequence of geometric operations, establishing a clear mapping between measured data, fixed geometric objects, and steady-state operating points. Quantities such as power factor, slip, output power, torque, and efficiency are obtained through explicit geometric relationships on the constructed diagram. Validation using a representative textbook example demonstrates close agreement with classical results. The framework provides a computational realization of the traditional Heyland diagram suitable for instruction, analysis, and systematic extension.

Abstract: In distributed computing systems, reducing the communication load during the data shuffling phase is a critical challenge, as excessive inter-node transmissions are a major performance bottleneck. One promising approach to alleviate this burden is Embedded Index Coding (EIC), which exploits cached data at user nodes to encode transmissions more efficiently. However, most prior work on EIC has focused on minimizing code length in wired, error-free environments-an objective often suboptimal for wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, where channel conditions and spatial multiplexing gains must be considered. This paper investigates the joint design of EIC and transmit beamforming in MIMO systems to minimize total transmission time, an NP-hard problem. We first present a conventional optimization method that determines the optimal EIC via exhaustive search. To address its prohibitive complexity and adapt to dynamic wireless environments, we propose a novel, low-complexity multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. The proposed framework enables decentralized agents to act on local observations while effectively managing the hybrid action space of discrete EIC selection and continuous beamforming design. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MARL-based approach achieves near-optimal performance with significantly reduced complexity, underscoring its effectiveness and practicality for real-world wireless systems.

Abstract: This paper develops a robust safety-critical control method for nonlinear strictfeedback systems with mismatched disturbances. Using a state transformation and a linear time-varying disturbance observer, the system is converted into a form that enables safe control design.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the robustness of parabolic-elliptic systems under boundary control. A sliding mode control strategy is proposed to reject matched perturbations. The stability analysis establishes finite-time convergence of the sliding manifold and exponential stability of the closed-loop system. Since the closed-loop system is discontinuous, we also prove its well-posedness. A numerical example is provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Latent force models, a class of hybrid modeling approaches, integrate physical knowledge of system dynamics with a latent force - an unknown, unmeasurable input modeled as a Gaussian process. In this work, we introduce two optimal state estimation frameworks to reconstruct the latent forces and to estimate the states. In contrast to state-of-the-art approaches, the designed estimators enable the consideration of system-inherent constraints. Finally, the performance of the novel frameworks is investigated in several numerical examples. In particular, we demonstrate the performance of the new framework in a real-world biomedical example - the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis - using hormone measurements.

Conclusion: 研制的基于样本和数据的移动视界估计框架能够仅利用少量非规则测量数据完成状态估计，无需精确数学模型，在测量数据有限的实际应用场景中具有重要价值，并通过胃肠道吸收系统案例验证了其有效性。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce a sample- and data-based moving horizon estimation framework for linear systems. We perform state estimation in a sample-based fashion in the sense that we assume to have only few, irregular output measurements available. This setting is encountered in applications where measuring is expensive or time-consuming. Furthermore, the state estimation framework does not rely on a standard mathematical model, but on an implicit system representation based on measured data. We prove sample-based practical robust exponential stability of the proposed estimator under mild assumptions. Furthermore, we apply the proposed scheme to estimate the states of a gastrointestinal tract absorption system.

Abstract: The classical Andronov-Vyshnegradsky problem, which deals with locating regions of stability and oscillations in control systems with a Watt regulator, is solved using a divergence method for studying the stability of dynamic systems. This system is studied both with and without the self-regulation effect. The exact value of the hidden boundary of the global stability region is obtained. The stability criteria for a system with a Watt regulator are also presented in the context of the solvability of a linear matrix inequality. Computer modelling shows that the system exhibits hidden oscillations when the self-regulation effect is present and when it is not. The conditions for computing the hidden boundary of global stability are determined by three parameters in the Watt regulator model.

The conditions for the system solutions to converge to zero and to a given region within a fixed-time are obtained. To achieve fast convergence, a negative power is applied to the derivative of a quadratic function within a specific time interval during the evolution of the system. The application of the proposed results to the design of control laws for arbitrary order linear plants using the backstepping method is considered. All the main results are accompanied by numerical modelling and a comparison of the proposed solutions with some existing ones.

Abstract: With the rapid growth of data volume in modern telecommunication networks and the continuous expansion of their scale, maintaining high reliability has become a critical requirement. These networks support a wide range of applications and services, including highly sensitive and mission-critical ones, which demand rapid and accurate detection and resolution of network errors. Traditional fault-diagnosis methods are no longer efficient for such complex environments.\cite{b1} In this study, we leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate network fault detection and classification. Various types of network errors were intentionally injected into a Kubernetes-based test network, and data were collected under both healthy and faulty conditions. The dataset includes logs from different network components (pods), along with complementary data such as system descriptions, events, Round Trip Time (RTT) tests, and pod status information. The dataset covers common fault types such as pod failure, pod kill, network delay, network loss, and disk I/O failures. We fine-tuned the GPT-4.1 nano model via its API on this dataset, resulting in a significant improvement in fault-detection accuracy compared to the base model. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-based approaches for achieving closed-loop, and operator-free fault management, which can enhance network reliability and reduce downtime-related operational costs for service providers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 360度等距柱面投影视频在传统压缩中存在采样密度不均匀的问题，导致质量分布不均。需要一种方法在不改变现有神经视频压缩模型架构的情况下，提高压缩效率和质量均匀性。

Method: 将传统视频编解码器的量化参数自适应技术扩展到神经视频压缩模型，利用等距柱面投影的空间变化采样密度特性，引入基于纬度的自适应质量参数，并通过矢量库插值进行潜在调制以实现灵活的适应。

Result: 在DCVC-RT框架上应用该方法，对于JVET S1测试序列，加权球形峰值信噪比的BD-Rate节省达到5.2%，处理时间仅增加0.3%。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效地改善了360度等距柱面投影视频在神经视频压缩中的性能，仅需极少的时间和计算开销即可实现显著的质量提升，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: This study proposes a practical approach for compressing 360-degree equirectangular videos using pretrained neural video compression (NVC) models. Without requiring additional training or changes in the model architectures, the proposed method extends quantization parameter adaptation techniques from traditional video codecs to NVC, utilizing the spatially varying sampling density in equirectangular projections. We introduce latitude-based adaptive quality parameters through rate-distortion optimization for NVC. The proposed method utilizes vector bank interpolation for latent modulation, enabling flexible adaptation with arbitrary quality parameters and mitigating the limitations caused by rounding errors in the adaptive quantization parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that applying this method to the DCVC-RT framework yields BD-Rate savings of 5.2% in terms of the weighted spherical peak signal-to-noise ratio for JVET class S1 test sequences, with only a 0.3% increase in processing time.

Abstract: We investigated two complementary strategies for multicontrast cardiac MR reconstruction: physics-consistent data-space augmentation (DualSpaceCMR) and parameter-efficient capacity scaling via VQPrompt and Moero. DualSpaceCMR couples image-level transforms with kspace noise and motion simulations while preserving forwardmodel consistency. VQPrompt adds a lightweight bottleneck prompt; Moero embeds a sparse mixture of experts within a deep unrolled network with histogram-based routing.
  In the multivendor, multisite CMRxRecon25 benchmark, we evaluate fewshot and out-of-distribution generalization. On small datasets, k-space motion-plus-noise improves reconstruction; on the large benchmark it degrades performance, revealing sensitivity to augmentation ratio and schedule. VQPrompt produces modest and consistent gains with negligible memory overhead. Moero continues to improve after early plateaus and maintains baseline-like fewshot and out-of-distribution behavior despite mild overfitting, but sparse routing lowers PyTorch throughput and makes wall clock time the main bottleneck. These results motivate scale-aware augmentation and suggest prompt-based capacity scaling as a practical path, while efficiency improvements are crucial for sparse expert models.

Abstract: Accurate assessment of bowel cleanliness is essential for effective colonoscopy procedures. The Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) offers a standardized scoring system but suffers from subjectivity and inter-observer variability when performed manually. In this paper, to support robust training and evaluation, we construct a high-quality colonoscopy dataset comprising 2,240 images from 517 subjects, annotated with expert-agreed BBPS scores. We propose a novel automated BBPS scoring framework that leverages the CLIP model with adapter-based transfer learning and a dedicated fecal-feature extraction branch. Our method fuses global visual features with stool-related textual priors to improve the accuracy of bowel cleanliness evaluation without requiring explicit segmentation. Extensive experiments on both our dataset and the public NERTHU dataset demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing baselines, highlighting its potential for clinical deployment in computer-aided colonoscopy analysis.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of ischemic stroke lesions from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for clinical decision-making and outcome assessment. Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) scans provide complementary information on acute and sub-acute ischemic changes; however, automated lesion delineation remains challenging due to variability in lesion appearance.
  In this work, we study ischemic stroke lesion segmentation using multimodal diffusion MRI from the ISLES 2022 dataset. Several state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based architectures, including U-Net variants, Swin-UNet, and TransUNet, are benchmarked. Based on performance, a dual-encoder TransUNet architecture is proposed to learn modality-specific representations from DWI and ADC inputs. To incorporate spatial context, adjacent slice information is integrated using a three-slice input configuration.
  All models are trained under a unified framework and evaluated using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). Results show that transformer-based models outperform convolutional baselines, and the proposed dual-encoder TransUNet achieves the best performance, reaching a Dice score of 85.4% on the test set. The proposed framework offers a robust solution for automated ischemic stroke lesion segmentation from diffusion MRI.

Abstract: Human activity recognition (HAR) using wearable sensors has advanced through various machine learning paradigms, each with inherent trade-offs between performance and labeling requirements. While fully supervised techniques achieve high accuracy, they demand extensive labeled datasets that are costly to obtain. Conversely, unsupervised methods eliminate labeling needs but often deliver suboptimal performance. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation across the supervision spectrum for wearable-based HAR, with particular focus on novel approaches that minimize labeling requirements while maintaining competitive accuracy. We develop and empirically compare: (1) traditional fully supervised learning, (2) basic unsupervised learning, (3) a weakly supervised learning approach with constraints, (4) a multi-task learning approach with knowledge sharing, (5) a self-supervised approach based on domain expertise, and (6) a novel weakly self-supervised learning framework that leverages domain knowledge and minimal labeled data. Experiments across benchmark datasets demonstrate that: (i) our weakly supervised methods achieve performance comparable to fully supervised approaches while significantly reducing supervision requirements; (ii) the proposed multi-task framework enhances performance through knowledge sharing between related tasks; (iii) our weakly self-supervised approach demonstrates remarkable efficiency with just 10\% of labeled data. These results not only highlight the complementary strengths of different learning paradigms, offering insights into tailoring HAR solutions based on the availability of labeled data, but also establish that our novel weakly self-supervised framework offers a promising solution for practical HAR applications where labeled data are limited.

Abstract: Early prediction of in-hospital mortality in critically ill patients can aid clinicians in optimizing treatment. The objective was to develop a multimodal deep learning model, using structured and unstructured clinical data, to predict in-hospital mortality risk among critically ill patients after their initial 24 hour intensive care unit (ICU) admission. We used data from MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, eICU, and HiRID. A multimodal model was developed on the MIMIC datasets, featuring time series components occurring within the first 24 hours of ICU admission and predicting risk of subsequent inpatient mortality. Inputs included time-invariant variables, time-variant variables, clinical notes, and chest X-ray images. External validation occurred in a temporally separated MIMIC population, HiRID, and eICU datasets. A total of 203,434 ICU admissions from more than 200 hospitals between 2001 to 2022 were included, in which mortality rate ranged from 5.2% to 7.9% across the four datasets. The model integrating structured data points had AUROC, AUPRC, and Brier scores of 0.92, 0.53, and 0.19, respectively. We externally validated the model on eight different institutions within the eICU dataset, demonstrating AUROCs ranging from 0.84-0.92. When including only patients with available clinical notes and imaging data, inclusion of notes and imaging into the model, the AUROC, AUPRC, and Brier score improved from 0.87 to 0.89, 0.43 to 0.48, and 0.37 to 0.17, respectively. Our findings highlight the importance of incorporating multiple sources of patient information for mortality prediction and the importance of external validation.

Abstract: Finding rare but useful solutions in very large candidate spaces is a recurring practical challenge across language generation, planning, and reinforcement learning. We present a practical framework, \emph{Inverted Causality Focusing Algorithm} (ICFA), that treats search as a target-conditioned reweighting process. ICFA reuses an available proposal sampler and a task-specific similarity function to form a focused sampling distribution, while adaptively controlling focusing strength to avoid degeneracy. We provide a clear recipe, a stability diagnostic based on effective sample size, a compact theoretical sketch explaining when ICFA can reduce sample needs, and two reproducible experiments: constrained language generation and sparse-reward navigation. We further show how structured prompts instantiate an approximate, language-level form of ICFA and describe a hybrid architecture combining prompted inference with algorithmic reweighting.

However, multimodal brain decoding still faces key challenges in cross-subject generalization and interpretability. We propose a BrainROI model and achieve leading-level results in brain-captioning evaluation on the NSD dataset. Under the cross-subject setting, compared with recent state-of-the-art methods and representative baselines, metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr show clear improvements. Firstly, to address the heterogeneity of functional brain topology across subjects, we design a new fMRI encoder. We use multi-atlas soft functional parcellations (soft-ROI) as a shared space. We extend the discrete ROI Concatenation strategy in MINDLLM to a voxel-wise gated fusion mechanism (Voxel-gate). We also ensure consistent ROI mapping through global label alignment, which enhances cross-subject transferability. Secondly, to overcome the limitations of manual and black-box prompting methods in stability and transparency, we introduce an interpretable prompt optimization process. In a small-sample closed loop, we use a locally deployed Qwen model to iteratively generate and select human-readable prompts. This process improves the stability of prompt design and preserves an auditable optimization trajectory. Finally, we impose parameterized decoding constraints during inference to further improve the stability and quality of the generated descriptions.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving era of Artificial Intelligence (AI), synthetic data are widely used to accelerate innovation while preserving privacy and enabling broader data accessibility. However, the evaluation of synthetic data remains fragmented across heterogeneous metrics, ad-hoc scripts, and incomplete reporting practices. To address this gap, we introduce Synthetic Data Blueprint (SDB), a modular Pythonic based library to quantitatively and visually assess the fidelity of synthetic tabular data. SDB supports: (i) automated feature-type detection, (ii) distributional and dependency-level fidelity metrics, (iii) graph- and embedding-based structure preservation scores, and (iv) a rich suite of data visualization schemas. To demonstrate the breadth, robustness, and domain-agnostic applicability of the SDB, we evaluated the framework across three real-world use cases that differ substantially in scale, feature composition, statistical complexity, and downstream analytical requirements. These include: (i) healthcare diagnostics, (ii) socioeconomic and financial modelling, and (iii) cybersecurity and network traffic analysis. These use cases reveal how SDB can address diverse data fidelity assessment challenges, varying from mixed-type clinical variables to high-cardinality categorical attributes and high-dimensional telemetry signals, while at the same time offering a consistent, transparent, and reproducible benchmarking across heterogeneous domains.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于快速模型更新的1-bit逐轴权重delta压缩方法，通过存储权重差异的符号和轻量级缩放因子来减小存储和启动延迟。


<details>

Motivation: 传统fine-tuned模型检查点体积大导致冷启动延迟高，但fine-tuned权重与基础模型的差异通常很小且有结构性，适合用压缩的delta表示。

Method: 采用1-bit delta方案，仅存储权重差异的符号，配合每个轴（行/列）的FP16缩放因子，通过小规模校准集学习。系统层面使用流式加载器，每个模块一次性传输压缩的delta。

Result: 相比标量方法提高了重建质量，存储空间远小于完整FP16检查点，显著减少冷启动延迟，推理效率保持。方法开箱即用，需要少量校准数据。

Conclusion: 所提出的1-bit逐轴权重delta方法能有效压缩模型更新，降低存储和启动开销，是一种实用的模型更新方案。

Abstract: Serving many task-specialized LLM variants is often limited by the large size of fine-tuned checkpoints and the resulting cold-start latency. Since fine-tuned weights differ from their base model by relatively small structured residuals, a natural approach is to represent them as compressed deltas. We propose a simple 1-bit delta scheme that stores only the sign of the weight difference together with lightweight per-axis (row/column) FP16 scaling factors, learned from a small calibration set. This design preserves the compactness of 1-bit deltas while more accurately capturing variation across weight dimensions, leading to improved reconstruction quality over scalar alternatives. From a systems perspective, a streamlined loader that transfers packed deltas in a single operation per module reduces cold-start latency and storage overhead, with artifacts several times smaller than a full FP16 checkpoint. The method is drop-in, requires minimal calibration data, and maintains inference efficiency by avoiding dense reconstruction.

Abstract: We introduce a sign-aware, multistate Jaccard/Tanimoto framework that extends overlap-based distances from nonnegative vectors and measures to arbitrary real- and complex-valued signals while retaining bounded metric and positive-semidefinite kernel structure. Formally, the construction is a set- and measure-theoretic geometry: signals are represented as atomic measures on a signed state space, and similarity is given by a generalized Jaccard overlap of these measures. Each signal is embedded into a nonnegative multistate representation, using positive/negative splits for real signals, Cartesian and polar decompositions for complex signals, and user-defined state partitions for refined regime analysis. Applying the Tanimoto construction to these embeddings yields a family of $[0,1]$ distances that satisfy the triangle inequality and define positive-semidefinite kernels usable directly in kernel methods and graph-based learning. Beyond pairwise distances, we develop coalition analysis via Möbius inversion, which decomposes signal magnitude into nonnegative, additive contributions with exact budget closure across coalitions of signals. Normalizing the same embeddings produces probability measures on coordinate -- state configurations, so that the distance becomes a monotone transform of total variation and admits a regime -- intensity decomposition. The resulting construction yields a single, mechanistically interpretable distance that simultaneously provides bounded metric structure, positive-semidefinite kernels, probabilistic semantics, and transparent budget accounting within one sign-aware framework, supporting correlograms, feature engineering, similarity graphs, and other analytical tools in scientific and financial applications.

Abstract: The Multi-Armed Bandit problem provides a fundamental framework for analyzing the tension between exploration and exploitation in sequential learning. This paper explores Information Directed Sampling (IDS) policies, a class of heuristics that balance immediate regret against information gain. We focus on the tractable environment of two-state Bernoulli bandits as a minimal model to rigorously compare heuristic strategies against the optimal policy. We extend the IDS framework to the discounted infinite-horizon setting by introducing a modified information measure and a tuning parameter to modulate the decision-making behavior. We examine two specific problem classes: symmetric bandits and the scenario involving one fair coin. In the symmetric case we show that IDS achieves bounded cumulative regret, whereas in the one-fair-coin scenario the IDS policy yields a regret that scales logarithmically with the horizon, in agreement with classical asymptotic lower bounds. This work serves as a pedagogical synthesis, aiming to bridge concepts from reinforcement learning and information theory for an audience of statistical physicists.

Abstract: This work introduces a methodology to adjust forecasts based on node-specific cost function asymmetry. The proposed model generates savings by dynamically incorporating the cost asymmetry into the forecasting error probability distribution to favor the least expensive scenario. Savings are calculated and a self-regulation mechanism modulates the adjustments magnitude based on the observed savings, enabling the model to adapt to station-specific conditions and unmodeled factors such as calibration errors or shifting macroeconomic dynamics. Finally, empirical results demonstrate the model's ability to achieve \$5.1M annual savings.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel end-to-end framework that efficiently integrates data quality assessment with machine learning (ML) model operations in real-time production environments. While existing approaches treat data quality assessment and ML systems as isolated processes, our framework addresses the critical gap between theoretical methods and practical implementation by combining dynamic drift detection, adaptive data quality metrics, and MLOps into a cohesive, lightweight system. The key innovation lies in its operational efficiency, enabling real-time, quality-driven ML decision-making with minimal computational overhead. We validate the framework in a steel manufacturing company's Electroslag Remelting (ESR) vacuum pumping process, demonstrating a 12% improvement in model performance (R2 = 94%) and a fourfold reduction in prediction latency. By exploring the impact of data quality acceptability thresholds, we provide actionable insights into balancing data quality standards and predictive performance in industrial applications. This framework represents a significant advancement in MLOps, offering a robust solution for time-sensitive, data-driven decision-making in dynamic industrial environments.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed significant progress in the development of machine learning models across a wide range of fields, fueled by increased computational resources, large-scale datasets, and the rise of deep learning architectures. From malware detection to enabling autonomous navigation, modern machine learning systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities. However, as these models are deployed in ever-changing real-world scenarios, their ability to remain reliable and adaptive over time becomes increasingly important. For example, in the real world, new malware families are continuously developed, whereas autonomous driving cars are employed in many different cities and weather conditions. Models trained in fixed settings can not respond effectively to novel conditions encountered post-deployment. In fact, most machine learning models are still developed under the assumption that training and test data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), i.e., sampled from the same underlying (unknown) distribution. While this assumption simplifies model development and evaluation, it does not hold in many real-world applications, where data changes over time and unexpected inputs frequently occur. Retraining models from scratch whenever new data appears is computationally expensive, time-consuming, and impractical in resource-constrained environments. These limitations underscore the need for Continual Learning (CL), which enables models to incrementally learn from evolving data streams without forgetting past knowledge, and Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, which allows systems to identify and respond to novel or anomalous inputs. Jointly addressing both challenges is critical to developing robust, efficient, and adaptive AI systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) continue to struggle with mathematical reasoning, and common post-training pipelines often reduce each generated solution to a binary outcome: correct or incorrect. This perspective is limiting in practice, as failures in chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning are frequently structured; solutions may appear convincing while containing subtle logical, algebraic, or numerical flaws. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) variants that rely on large reward models or LLM-as-a-judge signals are often expensive, difficult to scale, and unstable to iterate. We propose a lightweight and pragmatic post-training pipeline that targets such structured errors under realistic compute budgets. Starting from supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on MetaMathQA-style CoT data, we introduce a compact MathVerifier that decomposes a candidate solution into a six-dimensional error profile and aggregates it into interpretable wrongness and absurdity scores. These verifier signals serve two roles: (i) mining hard negatives that are near-correct yet structurally flawed, and (ii) defining per-sample importance weights that emphasize the most informative preference pairs. We integrate both into an offline Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) objective via a verifier-guided weighted formulation. Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter Qwen2.5 model show that verifier-guided, weighted DPO yields more targeted improvements than vanilla SFT and unweighted DPO, particularly on problems where solutions are numerically close to correct but logically inconsistent, while avoiding the overhead of training large reward models or relying on external judges.

Abstract: Diffusion models can learn rich representations during data generation, showing potential for Self-Supervised Learning (SSL), but they face a trade-off between generative quality and discriminative performance. Their iterative sampling also incurs substantial computational and energy costs, hindering industrial and edge AI applications. To address these issues, we propose the Flow Matching-based Foundation Model (FlowFM), which jointly trains a representation encoder and a conditional flow matching generator. This decoupled design achieves both high-fidelity generation and effective recognition. By using flow matching to learn a simpler velocity field, FlowFM accelerates and stabilizes training, improving its efficiency for representation learning. Experiments on wearable sensor data show FlowFM reduces training time by 50.4\% compared to a diffusion-based approach. On downstream tasks, FlowFM surpassed the state-of-the-art SSL method (SSL-Wearables) on all five datasets while achieving up to a 51.0x inference speedup and maintaining high generative quality. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/Okita-Laboratory/jointOptimizationFlowMatching.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to the security and reliability of deep learning models. To mitigate such attacks, one promising approach is to learn to extract features from the target model and use these features for backdoor detection. However, we discover that existing learning-based neural backdoor detection methods do not generalize well to new architectures not seen during the learning phase. In this paper, we analyze the root cause of this issue and propose a novel black-box neural backdoor detection method called ArcGen. Our method aims to obtain architecture-invariant model features, i.e., aligned features, for effective backdoor detection. Specifically, in contrast to existing methods directly using model outputs as model features, we introduce an additional alignment layer in the feature extraction function to further process these features. This reduces the direct influence of architecture information on the features. Then, we design two alignment losses to train the feature extraction function. These losses explicitly require that features from models with similar backdoor behaviors but different architectures are aligned at both the distribution and sample levels. With these techniques, our method demonstrates up to 42.5% improvements in detection performance (e.g., AUC) on unseen model architectures. This is based on a large-scale evaluation involving 16,896 models trained on diverse datasets, subjected to various backdoor attacks, and utilizing different model architectures. Our code is available at https://github.com/SeRAlab/ArcGen.

Motivation: 研究可控马尔可夫链中最优探索策略的必要性，因为存在瞬态、吸收态和非回溯态等特殊状态会限制对动力学的控制，这使得非平稳策略对于实现最优探索至关重要。

Conclusion: 研究证明了在存在特殊状态类型的情况下，非平稳策略对于可控马尔可夫链的最优探索是必要的，提出的方法为未知环境中的学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Controllable Markov chains describe the dynamics of sequential decision making tasks and are the central component in optimal control and reinforcement learning. In this work, we give the general form of an optimal policy for learning controllable dynamics in an unknown environment by exploring over a limited time horizon. This policy is simple to implement and efficient to compute, and allows an agent to ``learn by exploring" as it maximizes its information gain in a greedy fashion by selecting controls from a constraint set that changes over time during exploration. We give a simple parameterization for the set of controls, and present an algorithm for finding an optimal policy. The reason for this policy is due to the existence of certain types of states that restrict control of the dynamics; such as transient states, absorbing states, and non-backtracking states. We show why the occurrence of these states makes a non-stationary policy essential for achieving optimal exploration. Six interesting examples of controllable dynamics are treated in detail. Policy optimality is demonstrated using counting arguments, comparing with suboptimal policies, and by making use of a sequential improvement property from dynamic programming.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有带隙预测研究中，描述符可能无意中编码了带结构信息（如有效质量），导致模型性能被高估。需要构建防泄漏数据集，准确评估描述符对带隙预测的真实贡献。

Method: 1) 系统分析JARVIS-DFT数据集，识别并移除可能泄漏带结构信息的描述符；2) 构建包含2280个材料的防泄漏数据集；3) 实现三阶段建模框架：逐步加入基础物理描述符、工程特征和成分属性；4) 使用树模型和SHAP分析评估特征重要性。

Result: 树模型在所有三个阶段都达到R2≈0.88-0.90，表明扩展描述符空间在控制泄漏后不会显著提升预测精度。SHAP分析一致显示介电张量分量是最重要的特征贡献者。

Conclusion: 研究提供了防泄漏的带隙预测数据集和基准性能，证明在控制泄漏后，复杂特征工程对预测精度提升有限，介电特性是带隙预测的最关键因素。

Abstract: In this study, we perform a systematic analysis of the JARVIS-DFT bandgap dataset and identify and remove descriptors that may inadvertently encode band-structure information, such as effective masses. This process yields a curated, leakage-controlled subset of 2280 materials. Using this dataset, a three-phase modeling framework is implemented that incrementally incorporates basic physical descriptors, engineered features, and compositional attributes. The results show that tree-based models achieve R2 values of approximately 0.88 to 0.90 across all phases, indicating that expanding the descriptor space does not substantially improve predictive accuracy when leakage is controlled. SHAP analysis consistently identifies the dielectric tensor components as the dominant contributors. This work provides a curated dataset and baseline performance metrics for future leakage-aware bandgap prediction studies.

Motivation: LLMs在医疗预测中展现潜力，但存在性别、年龄、种族等人口统计学偏见，影响临床决策信任度。现有去偏见方法常降低预测性能，难以同时优化公平性与准确性。

Method: 首先开发多维度偏见评估方案进行全面模型诊断；随后提出CAP提示框架，整合传统去偏见提示与基于案例的推理，引导模型从历史错误预测案例中学习并修正偏见推理模式。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集上，CAP显著提升预测性能与公平性：AUROC从0.806升至0.873，AUPRC从0.497升至0.694，性别与种族相关差异减少超90%；特征依赖分析显示跨人口群体注意力模式高度一致（相似度>0.98）。

Conclusion: LLMs在ICU死亡率预测中存在可度量偏见，而精心设计的提示框架能在无需重新训练的情况下协同优化公平性与性能，为公平临床决策支持提供可迁移范式。

Abstract: Accurate mortality risk prediction for intensive care unit (ICU) patients is essential for clinical decision-making. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in predicting outcomes from structured medical data, their predictions may exhibit demographic biases related to sex, age, and race, limiting their trustworthy use in clinical practice. Existing debiasing methods often reduce predictive performance, making it difficult to jointly optimize fairness and accuracy. In this study, we systematically examine bias in LLM-based ICU mortality prediction and propose a training-free, clinically adaptive prompting framework to simultaneously improve fairness and performance. We first develop a multi-dimensional bias assessment scheme for comprehensive model diagnosis. Building on this analysis, we introduce CAse Prompting (CAP), a novel prompting framework that integrates conventional debiasing prompts with case-based reasoning. CAP guides the model to learn from similar historical misprediction cases and their correct outcomes, enabling correction of biased reasoning patterns. Experiments on the MIMIC-IV dataset show that CAP substantially improves both predictive accuracy and fairness. CAP increases AUROC from 0.806 to 0.873 and AUPRC from 0.497 to 0.694, while reducing sex- and race-related disparities by over 90%. Feature reliance analysis further indicates highly consistent attention patterns across demographic groups, with similarity scores exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit measurable bias in ICU mortality prediction, and that a carefully designed prompting framework can effectively co-optimize fairness and performance without retraining, offering a transferable paradigm for equitable clinical decision support.

Abstract: Reliable prediction of train delays is essential for enhancing the robustness and efficiency of railway transportation systems. In this work, we reframe delay forecasting as a stochastic simulation task, modeling state-transition dynamics through imitation learning. We introduce Drift-Corrected Imitation Learning (DCIL), a novel self-supervised algorithm that extends DAgger by incorporating distance-based drift correction, thereby mitigating covariate shift during rollouts without requiring access to an external oracle or adversarial schemes. Our approach synthesizes the dynamical fidelity of event-driven models with the representational capacity of data-driven methods, enabling uncertainty-aware forecasting via Monte Carlo simulation. We evaluate DCIL using a comprehensive real-world dataset from \textsc{Infrabel}, the Belgian railway infrastructure manager, which encompasses over three million train movements. Our results, focused on predictions up to 30 minutes ahead, demonstrate superior predictive performance of DCIL over traditional regression models and behavioral cloning on deep learning architectures, highlighting its effectiveness in capturing the sequential and uncertain nature of delay propagation in large-scale networks.

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of package volumes at delivery stations is critical for last-mile logistics, where errors lead to inefficient resource allocation, higher costs, and delivery delays. We propose OpComm, a forecasting and decision-support framework that combines supervised learning with reinforcement learning-based buffer control and a generative AI-driven communication module. A LightGBM regression model generates station-level demand forecasts, which serve as context for a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent that selects buffer levels from a discrete action set. The reward function penalizes under-buffering more heavily than over-buffering, reflecting real-world trade-offs between unmet demand risks and resource inefficiency. Station outcomes are fed back through a Monte Carlo update mechanism, enabling continual policy adaptation. To enhance interpretability, a generative AI layer produces executive-level summaries and scenario analyses grounded in SHAP-based feature attributions. Across 400+ stations, OpComm reduced Weighted Absolute Percentage Error (WAPE) by 21.65% compared to manual forecasts, while lowering under-buffering incidents and improving transparency for decision-makers. This work shows how contextual reinforcement learning, coupled with predictive modeling, can address operational forecasting challenges and bridge statistical rigor with practical decision-making in high-stakes logistics environments.

Abstract: Voice assistants utilize Keyword Spotting (KWS) to enable efficient, privacy-friendly activation. However, realizing accurate KWS models on ultra-low-power TinyML devices (often with less than $<2$ MB of flash memory) necessitates a delicate balance between accuracy with strict resource constraints. Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) is an ideal candidate for managing such a trade-off but is highly initialization-dependent, especially under the budgeted black-box setting. Existing methods typically fall back to naive, ad-hoc sampling routines (e.g., Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), Sobol sequences, or Random search) that are adapted to neither the Pareto front nor undergo rigorous statistical comparison. To address this, we propose Objective-Aware Surrogate Initialization (OASI), a novel initialization strategy that leverages Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA) to generate a seed Pareto set of high-performing and diverse configurations that explicitly balance accuracy and model size. Evaluated in a TinyML KWS setting, OASI outperforms LHS, Sobol, and Random initialization, achieving the highest hypervolume (0.0627) and the lowest generational distance (0.0) across multiple runs, with only a modest increase in computation time (1934 s vs. $\sim$1500 s). A non-parametric statistical analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis test ($H = 5.40$, $p = 0.144$, $η^2 = 0.0007$) and Dunn's post-hoc test confirms OASI's superior consistency despite the non-significant overall difference with respect to the $α=0.05$ threshold.

TL;DR: 针对边缘设备部署大模型的内存、计算和延迟约束，提出多阶段优化流程压缩Vision Transformers，通过激活分析、内存感知剪枝、混合精度和量化，在不需重训练下显著减小内存占用并加速推理。


<details>

Motivation: 边缘设备部署大规模Transformer模型面临内存、计算资源和延迟的严格限制，需要轻量化但有效的压缩方案，以避免昂贵的重训练或任务特定微调。

Method: 结合激活分析（前向钩子收集统计）、内存感知结构化剪枝（针对MLP层）、选择性混合精度（FP16）和激活感知量化（AWQ），从ViT-Huge（6.32亿参数）出发，压缩模型至INT8。

Conclusion: 该框架为边缘平台上的高效Transformer推理提供了实用路径，并展望了动态稀疏性和MoE架构以进一步提升跨任务性能。

Abstract: Deploying large-scale transformer models on edge devices presents significant challenges due to strict constraints on memory, compute, and latency. In this work, we propose a lightweight yet effective multi-stage optimization pipeline designed to compress and accelerate Vision Transformers (ViTs) for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Our methodology combines activation profiling, memory-aware pruning, selective mixed-precision execution, and activation-aware quantization (AWQ) to reduce the model's memory footprint without requiring costly retraining or task-specific fine-tuning. Starting from a ViT-Huge backbone with 632 million parameters, we first identify low-importance channels using activation statistics collected via forward hooks, followed by structured pruning to shrink the MLP layers under a target memory budget. We further apply FP16 conversion to selected components and leverage AWQ to quantize the remaining model weights and activations to INT8 with minimal accuracy degradation. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that the fully optimized model achieves a 76% reduction in peak memory usage and over 6x lower latency, while retaining or even improving accuracy compared to the original FP32 baseline. This framework offers a practical path toward efficient transformer inference on edge platforms, and opens future avenues for integrating dynamic sparsity and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures to further scale performance across diverse tasks.

Abstract: Loss functions are fundamental to learning accurate 3D point cloud models, yet common choices trade geometric fidelity for computational cost. Chamfer Distance is efficient but permits many-to-one correspondences, while Earth Mover Distance better reflects one-to-one transport at high computational cost. APML approximates transport with differentiable Sinkhorn iterations and an analytically derived temperature, but its dense formulation scales quadratically in memory. We present CUDA-APML, a sparse GPU implementation that thresholds negligible assignments and runs adaptive softmax, bidirectional symmetrization, and Sinkhorn normalization directly in COO form. This yields near-linear memory scaling and preserves gradients on the stored support, while pairwise distance evaluation remains quadratic in the current implementation. On ShapeNet and MM-Fi, CUDA-APML matches dense APML within a small tolerance while reducing peak GPU memory by 99.9%. Code available at: https://github.com/Multimodal-Sensing-Lab/apml

Abstract: Reproducibility is essential in machine learning because it ensures that a model or experiment yields the same scientific conclusion. For specific algorithms repeatability with bitwise identical results is also a key for scientific integrity because it allows debugging. We decomposed several very popular clustering algorithms: K-Means, DBSCAN and Ward into their fundamental steps, and we identify the conditions required to achieve repeatability at each stage. We use an implementation example with the Python library scikit-learn to examine the repeatable aspects of each method. Our results reveal inconsistent results with K-Means when the number of OpenMP threads exceeds two. This work aims to raise awareness of this issue among both users and developers, encouraging further investigation and potential fixes.

Abstract: This paper introduces a marketing decision framework that converts heterogeneous-treatment uplift into constrained targeting strategies to maximize revenue and retention while honoring business guardrails. The approach estimates Conditional Average Treatment Effects (CATE) with uplift learners and then solves a constrained allocation to decide who to target and which offer to deploy under limits such as budget or acceptable sales deterioration. Applied to retention messaging, event rewards, and spend-threshold assignment, the framework consistently outperforms propensity and static baselines in offline evaluations using uplift AUC, Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS), and Self-Normalized IPS (SNIPS). A production-scale online A/B test further validates strategic lift on revenue and completion while preserving customer-experience constraints. The result is a reusable playbook for marketers to operationalize causal targeting at scale, set guardrails, and align campaigns with strategic KPIs.

Abstract: When adapting large language models (LLMs) to a specific downstream task, two primary approaches are commonly employed: (1) prompt engineering, often with in-context few-shot learning, leveraging the model's inherent generalization abilities, and (2) fine-tuning on task-specific data, directly optimizing the model's parameters. While prompt-based methods excel in few-shot scenarios, their effectiveness often plateaus as more data becomes available. Conversely, fine-tuning scales well with data but may underperform when training examples are scarce. We investigate a unified approach that bridges these two paradigms by incorporating in-context learning directly into the fine-tuning process. Specifically, we fine-tune the model on task-specific data augmented with in-context examples, mimicking the structure of k-shot prompts. This approach, while requiring per-task fine-tuning, combines the sample efficiency of in-context learning with the performance gains of fine-tuning, leading to a method that consistently matches and often significantly exceeds both these baselines. To perform hyperparameter selection in the low-data regime, we propose to use prequential evaluation, which eliminates the need for expensive cross-validation and leverages all available data for training while simultaneously providing a robust validation signal. We conduct an extensive empirical study to determine which adaptation paradigm - fine-tuning, in-context learning, or our proposed unified approach offers the best predictive performance on a concrete data downstream-tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文从理论上研究了大型语言模型的推理时间扩展问题。作者使用贝叶斯线性回归构建了一个可分析的模型来理解推理时间采样对泛化误差的影响。研究发现，在奖励函数设定良好的情况下，推理时间采样能有效降低泛化误差。但当奖励指定错误时，过多的采样反而可能损害性能。研究还确定了最佳采样温度和推理采样次数，并通过实验验证了理论结论。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在推理时间计算资源的分配方面取得进展，但推理时间扩展的基本原则尚未得到很好的理解。当前对推理时间计算如何影响模型性能的理论认识不足，这阻碍了对计算资源最优分配的理解。

Method: 论文采用贝叶斯线性回归结合奖励加权采样器构建分析模型。在高维度场景下，通过确定等价关系推导后验预测的均值和方差的闭式解。分析在数据来自教师模型时的泛化误差，研究不同的采样次数k和软最大化温度对性能的影响。理论分析通过极值理论推导最佳-k场景下的误差衰减规律。

Result: 研究发现：1）当奖励函数与教师模型差异不大时，泛化误差随采样次数k增加单调下降；2）奖励函数设定错误会导致存在最优k值，超过后会损害性能；3）对于固定k存在最优采样温度；4）在最佳-k场景下，泛化误差衰减速度可达Θ(1/k²)；5）当任务难度增加时，推理时间计算的优势会下降。实验验证了这些理论结果。

Conclusion: 推理时间计算扩展的有效性依赖于奖励函数的适当设定。研究为计算资源分配提供了理论指导：在奖励函数良好的情况下，增加推理时间采样是有效的，但当奖励严重错配或任务难度极高时，收集更多训练数据可能是更好的选择。这为优化大型语言模型的计算资源配置提供了理论依据。

Abstract: Recent developments in large language models have shown advantages in reallocating a notable share of computational resource from training time to inference time. However, the principles behind inference time scaling are not well understood. In this paper, we introduce an analytically tractable model of inference-time scaling: Bayesian linear regression with a reward-weighted sampler, where the reward is determined from a linear model, modeling LLM-as-a-judge scenario. We study this problem in the high-dimensional regime, where the deterministic equivalents dictate a closed-form expression for the posterior predictive mean and variance. We analyze the generalization error when training data are sampled from a teacher model. We draw $k$ inference-time samples and select via softmax at a temperature applied to a quadratic reward. When the reward is not too different from the teacher, the generalization error decreases monotonically with increasing inference time samples $k$. However, the specific reward that optimizes inference-time selection generally differs from the teacher. In contrast, substantial reward misspecification induces a finite optimal $k$ beyond which more sampling can increase the generalization error. For fixed $k$, there exists an optimal sampling temperature. We experimentally verify these facts in large language model inference with an additional large language model as a judge. In the "best-of-$k$" limit with the teacher as reward, we theoretically show that the generalization error decays as $Θ(1/k^2)$ and determine the leading coefficient via extreme value theory. These formulas delineate domains where scaling inference-time computation is provably preferable to collecting more data. Finally, we demonstrate that when task difficulty increases, the previously mentioned advantage of inference-time compute degrades.

Abstract: Recent developments in non-ergodic ground-motion models (GMMs) explicitly model systematic spatial variations in source, site, and path effects, reducing standard deviation to 30-40% of ergodic models and enabling more accurate site-specific seismic hazard analysis. Current non-ergodic GMMs rely on Gaussian Process (GP) methods with prescribed correlation functions and thus have computational limitations for large-scale predictions. This study proposes a deep-learning approach called Conditional Generative Modeling for Fourier Amplitude Spectra (CGM-FAS) as an alternative to GP-based methods for modeling non-ergodic path effects in Fourier Amplitude Spectra (FAS). CGM-FAS uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder architecture to learn spatial patterns and interfrequency correlation directly from data by using geographical coordinates of earthquakes and stations as conditional variables. Using San Francisco Bay Area earthquake data, we compare CGM-FAS against a recent GP-based GMM for the region and demonstrate consistent predictions of non-ergodic path effects. Additionally, CGM-FAS offers advantages compared to GP-based approaches in learning spatial patterns without prescribed correlation functions, capturing interfrequency correlations, and enabling rapid predictions, generating maps for 10,000 sites across 1,000 frequencies within 10 seconds using a few GB of memory. CGM-FAS hyperparameters can be tuned to ensure generated path effects exhibit variability consistent with the GP-based empirical GMM. This work demonstrates a promising direction for efficient non-ergodic ground-motion prediction across multiple frequencies and large spatial domains.

Abstract: LLM deployment in critical domains is currently impeded by persistent hallucinations--generating plausible but factually incorrect assertions. While scaling laws drove significant improvements in general capabilities, theoretical frameworks suggest hallucination is not merely stochastic error but a predictable statistical consequence of training objectives prioritizing mimicking data distribution over epistemic honesty. Standard RLVR paradigms, utilizing binary reward signals, inadvertently incentivize models as good test-takers rather than honest communicators, encouraging guessing whenever correctness probability exceeds zero. This paper presents an exhaustive investigation into behavioral calibration, which incentivizes models to stochastically admit uncertainty by abstaining when not confident, aligning model behavior with accuracy. Synthesizing recent advances, we propose and evaluate training interventions optimizing strictly proper scoring rules for models to output a calibrated probability of correctness. Our methods enable models to either abstain from producing a complete response or flag individual claims where uncertainty remains. Utilizing Qwen3-4B-Instruct, empirical analysis reveals behavior-calibrated reinforcement learning allows smaller models to surpass frontier models in uncertainty quantification--a transferable meta-skill decouplable from raw predictive accuracy. Trained on math reasoning tasks, our model's log-scale Accuracy-to-Hallucination Ratio gain (0.806) exceeds GPT-5's (0.207) in a challenging in-domain evaluation (BeyondAIME). Moreover, in cross-domain factual QA (SimpleQA), our 4B LLM achieves zero-shot calibration error on par with frontier models including Grok-4 and Gemini-2.5-Pro, even though its factual accuracy is much lower.

Abstract: Seismology faces fundamental challenges in state forecasting and reconstruction (e.g., earthquake early warning and ground motion prediction) and managing the parametric variability of source locations, mechanisms, and Earth models (e.g., subsurface structure and topography effects). Addressing these with simulations is hindered by their massive scale, both in synthetic data volumes and numerical complexity, while real-data efforts are constrained by models that inadequately reflect the Earth's complexity and by sparse sensor measurements from the field. Recent machine learning (ML) efforts offer promise, but progress is obscured by a lack of proper characterization, fair reporting, and rigorous comparisons. To address this, we introduce a Common Task Framework (CTF) for ML for seismic wavefields, starting with three distinct wavefield datasets. Our CTF features a curated set of datasets at various scales (global, crustal, and local) and task-specific metrics spanning forecasting, reconstruction, and generalization under realistic constraints such as noise and limited data. Inspired by CTFs in fields like natural language processing, this framework provides a structured and rigorous foundation for head-to-head algorithm evaluation. We illustrate the evaluation procedure with scores reported for two of the datasets, showcasing the performance of various methods and foundation models for reconstructing seismic wavefields from both simulated and real-world sensor measurements. The CTF scores reveal the strengths, limitations, and suitability for specific problem classes. Our vision is to replace ad hoc comparisons with standardized evaluations on hidden test sets, raising the bar for rigor and reproducibility in scientific ML.

Conclusion: 金融机器学习的对抗鲁棒性是制度依赖属性，需要在高风险金融部署中采用压力感知的模型风险评估方法，并结合语义审计提升模型透明度。

Abstract: Machine learning models used in financial decision systems operate in nonstationary economic environments, yet adversarial robustness is typically evaluated under static assumptions. This work introduces Conditional Adversarial Fragility, a regime dependent phenomenon in which adversarial vulnerability is systematically amplified during periods of macroeconomic stress. We propose a regime aware evaluation framework for time indexed tabular financial classification tasks that conditions robustness assessment on external indicators of economic stress. Using volatility based regime segmentation as a proxy for macroeconomic conditions, we evaluate model behavior across calm and stress periods while holding model architecture, attack methodology, and evaluation protocols constant. Baseline predictive performance remains comparable across regimes, indicating that economic stress alone does not induce inherent performance degradation. Under adversarial perturbations, however, models operating during stress regimes exhibit substantially greater degradation across predictive accuracy, operational decision thresholds, and risk sensitive outcomes. We further demonstrate that this amplification propagates to increased false negative rates, elevating the risk of missed high risk cases during adverse conditions. To complement numerical robustness metrics, we introduce an interpretive governance layer based on semantic auditing of model explanations using large language models. Together, these results demonstrate that adversarial robustness in financial machine learning is a regime dependent property and motivate stress aware approaches to model risk assessment in high stakes financial deployments.

Conclusion: LoFT-LLM通过结合低频学习和语义校准（大语言模型），有效解决了小样本时间序列预测中的噪声和趋势捕捉问题，在多领域应用中展现出卓越性能。

Abstract: Time-series forecasting in real-world applications such as finance and energy often faces challenges due to limited training data and complex, noisy temporal dynamics. Existing deep forecasting models typically supervise predictions using full-length temporal windows, which include substantial high-frequency noise and obscure long-term trends. Moreover, auxiliary variables containing rich domain-specific information are often underutilized, especially in few-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose LoFT-LLM, a frequency-aware forecasting pipeline that integrates low-frequency learning with semantic calibration via a large language model (LLM). Firstly, a Patch Low-Frequency forecasting Module (PLFM) extracts stable low-frequency trends from localized spectral patches. Secondly, a residual learner then models high-frequency variations. Finally, a fine-tuned LLM refines the predictions by incorporating auxiliary context and domain knowledge through structured natural language prompts. Extensive experiments on financial and energy datasets demonstrate that LoFT-LLM significantly outperforms strong baselines under both full-data and few-shot regimes, delivering superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

Abstract: Diffusion models offer a robust framework for sampling from unnormalized probability densities, which requires accurately estimating the score of the noise-perturbed target distribution. While the standard Denoising Score Identity (DSI) relies on data samples, access to the target energy function enables an alternative formulation via the Target Score Identity (TSI). However, these estimators face a fundamental variance trade-off: DSI exhibits high variance in low-noise regimes, whereas TSI suffers from high variance at high noise levels. In this work, we reconcile these approaches by unifying both estimators within the principled framework of control variates. We introduce the Control Variate Score Identity (CVSI), deriving an optimal, time-dependent control coefficient that theoretically guarantees variance minimization across the entire noise spectrum. We demonstrate that CVSI serves as a robust, low-variance plug-in estimator that significantly enhances sample efficiency in both data-free sampler learning and inference-time diffusion sampling.

Abstract: Class imbalance is a common challenge in machine learning and data mining, often leading to suboptimal performance in classifiers. While deep learning excels in feature extraction, its performance still deteriorates under imbalanced data. In this work, we propose a novel activation function, named OGAB, designed to alleviate class imbalance in deep learning classifiers. OGAB incorporates orthogonality and group-aware bias learning to enhance feature distinguishability in imbalanced scenarios without explicitly requiring label information. Our key insight is that activation functions can be used to introduce strong inductive biases that can address complex data challenges beyond traditional non-linearity. Our work demonstrates that orthogonal transformations can preserve information about minority classes by maintaining feature independence, thereby preventing the dominance of majority classes in the embedding space. Further, the proposed group-aware bias mechanism automatically identifies data clusters and adjusts embeddings to enhance class separability without the need for explicit supervision. Unlike existing approaches that address class imbalance through preprocessing data modifications or post-processing corrections, our proposed approach tackles class imbalance during the training phase at the embedding learning level, enabling direct integration with the learning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution on both real-world and synthetic imbalanced datasets, showing consistent performance improvements over both traditional and learnable activation functions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散流模型(DFMs)在离散数据生成方面表现优异，但由于其迭代性质导致采样速度慢。现有的加速方法大多依赖微调，带来了大量额外训练开销，需要更轻量化的解决方案。

Method: 受ReFlow及其DFM扩展启发，PairFlow无需预训练教师模型，通过DFMs的闭式反演高效构建源-目标分布配对样本，以极低成本实现DFM训练。

Result: 在分子数据、二值和RGB图像上的实验表明，计算成本仅为完整模型训练的1.7%，却能达到或超越涉及微调的两阶段训练性能，且能为后续蒸馏提供更好的基础模型。

Conclusion: PairFlow是一种广泛适用且有效的轻量级方法，显著降低了DFMs的采样延迟和训练成本，同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: We introduce $\texttt{PairFlow}$, a lightweight preprocessing step for training Discrete Flow Models (DFMs) to achieve few-step sampling without requiring a pretrained teacher. DFMs have recently emerged as a new class of generative models for discrete data, offering strong performance. However, they suffer from slow sampling due to their iterative nature. Existing acceleration methods largely depend on finetuning, which introduces substantial additional training overhead. $\texttt{PairFlow}$ addresses this issue with a lightweight preprocessing step. Inspired by ReFlow and its extension to DFMs, we train DFMs from coupled samples of source and target distributions, without requiring any pretrained teacher. At the core of our approach is a closed-form inversion for DFMs, which allows efficient construction of paired source-target samples. Despite its extremely low cost, taking only up to 1.7% of the compute needed for full model training, $\texttt{PairFlow}$ matches or even surpasses the performance of two-stage training involving finetuning. Furthermore, models trained with our framework provide stronger base models for subsequent distillation, yielding further acceleration after finetuning. Experiments on molecular data as well as binary and RGB images demonstrate the broad applicability and effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Adsorption energy is a key descriptor of catalytic reactivity. It is fundamentally defined as the difference between the relaxed total energy of the adsorbate-surface system and that of an appropriate reference state; therefore, the accuracy of relaxed-energy prediction directly determines the reliability of machine-learning-driven catalyst screening. E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs) can natively operate on three-dimensional atomic coordinates under periodic boundary conditions and have demonstrated strong performance on such tasks. In contrast, language-model-based approaches, while enabling human-readable textual descriptions and reducing reliance on explicit graph -- thereby broadening applicability -- remain insufficient in both adsorption-configuration energy prediction accuracy and in distinguishing ``the same system with different configurations,'' even with graph-assisted pretraining in the style of GAP-CATBERTa.
  To this end, we propose QE-Catalytic, a multimodal framework that deeply couples a large language model (\textbf{Q}wen) with an E(3)-equivariant graph Transformer (\textbf{E}quiformer-V2), enabling unified support for adsorption-configuration property prediction and inverse design on complex catalytic surfaces. During prediction, QE-Catalytic jointly leverages three-dimensional structures and structured configuration text, and injects ``3D geometric information'' into the language channel via graph-text alignment, allowing it to function as a high-performance text-based predictor when precise coordinates are unavailable, while also autoregressively generating CIF files for target-energy-driven structure design and information completion. On OC20, QE-Catalytic reduces the MAE of relaxed adsorption energy from 0.713~eV to 0.486~eV, and consistently outperforms baseline models such as CatBERTa and GAP-CATBERTa across multiple evaluation protocols.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal graph neural networks (ST-GNNs) have achieved notable success in structured domains such as road traffic and public transportation, where spatial entities can be naturally represented as fixed nodes. In contrast, many real-world systems including maritime traffic lack such fixed anchors, making the construction of spatio-temporal graphs a fundamental challenge. Anomaly detection in these non-grid environments is particularly difficult due to the absence of canonical reference points, the sparsity and irregularity of trajectories, and the fact that anomalies may manifest at multiple granularities. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset for anomaly detection in the maritime domain, extending the Open Maritime Traffic Analysis Dataset (OMTAD) into a benchmark tailored for graph-based anomaly detection. Our dataset enables systematic evaluation across three different granularities: node-level, edge-level, and graph-level anomalies. We plan to employ two specialized LLM-based agents: \emph{Trajectory Synthesizer} and \emph{Anomaly Injector} to construct richer interaction contexts and generate semantically meaningful anomalies. We expect this benchmark to promote reproducibility and to foster methodological advances in anomaly detection for non-grid spatio-temporal systems.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn a policy that maximizes the expected return using a given static dataset of transitions. However, offline RL faces the distribution shift problem. The policy constraint offline RL method is proposed to solve the distribution shift problem. During the policy constraint offline RL training, it is important to ensure the difference between the learned policy and behavior policy within a given threshold. Thus, the learned policy heavily relies on the quality of the behavior policy. However, a problem exists in existing policy constraint methods: if the dataset contains many low-reward transitions, the learned will be contained with a suboptimal reference policy, leading to slow learning speed, low sample efficiency, and inferior performances. This paper shows that the sampling method in policy constraint offline RL that uses all the transitions in the dataset can be improved. A simple but efficient sample filtering method is proposed to improve the sample efficiency and the final performance. First, we evaluate the score of the transitions by average reward and average discounted reward of episodes in the dataset and extract the transition samples of high scores. Second, the high-score transition samples are used to train the offline RL algorithms. We verify the proposed method in a series of offline RL algorithms and benchmark tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms baselines.

Motivation: 大语言模型（LLMs）通过先生成推理依据再回答问题来解决推理问题。现有方法（如STaR）效率不高，作者希望从隐变量模型的视角形式化推理过程，推导出更有效的学习目标，并比较不同采样方案的性能差异。

Method: 1. 将推理形式化为隐变量模型，推导出EM优化目标；2. 连接现代基于奖励的优化方法；3. 实例化多种采样方案：带预算的拒绝采样、STaR和PPS；4. 在ARC、MMLU和OpenBookQA数据集上的Llama和Qwen模型上进行实验比较。

Conclusion: 从隐变量模型视角形式化推理学习提供了理论框架，证明了采样方案选择的重要性。PPS作为一种简单高效的采样方法，能够有效提升LLMs在推理任务上的准确性，为未来推理学习方法设计提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) solve reasoning problems by first generating a rationale and then answering. We formalize reasoning as a latent variable model and derive an expectation-maximization (EM) objective for learning to reason. This view connects EM and modern reward-based optimization, and shows that the main challenge lies in designing a sampling distribution that generates rationales that justify correct answers. We instantiate and compare several sampling schemes: rejection sampling with a budget, self-taught reasoner (STaR), and prompt posterior sampling (PPS), which only keeps the rationalization stage of STaR. Our experiments on the ARC, MMLU, and OpenBookQA datasets with the Llama and Qwen models show that the sampling scheme can significantly affect the accuracy of learned reasoning models. Despite its simplicity, we observe that PPS outperforms the other sampling schemes.

Abstract: Global gridded crop models (GGCMs) simulate daily crop growth by explicitly representing key biophysical processes and project end-of-season yield time series. They are a primary tool to quantify the impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity and assess associated risks for food security. Despite decades of development, state-of-the-art GGCMs still have substantial uncertainties in simulating complex biophysical processes due to limited process understanding. Recently, machine learning approaches trained on observational data have shown great potential in crop yield predictions. However, these models have not demonstrated improved performance over classical GGCMs and are not suitable for simulating crop yields under changing climate conditions due to problems in generalizing outside their training distributions. Here we introduce NeuralCrop, a hybrid GGCM that combines the strengths of an advanced process-based GGCM, resolving important processes explicitly, with data-driven machine learning components. The model is first trained to emulate a competitive GGCM before it is fine-tuned on observational data. We show that NeuralCrop outperforms state-of-the-art GGCMs across site-level and large-scale cropping regions. Across moisture conditions, NeuralCrop reproduces the interannual yield anomalies in European wheat regions and the US Corn Belt more accurately during the period from 2000 to 2019 with particularly strong improvements under drought extremes. When generalizing to conditions unseen during training, NeuralCrop continues to make robust projections, while pure machine learning models exhibit substantial performance degradation. Our results show that our hybrid crop modelling approach offers overall improved crop modeling and more reliable yield projections under climate change and intensifying extreme weather conditions.

Abstract: Federated learning across multi-cloud environments faces critical challenges, including non-IID data distributions, malicious participant detection, and substantial cross-cloud communication costs (egress fees). Existing Byzantine-robust methods focus primarily on model accuracy while overlooking the economic implications of data transfer across cloud providers. This paper presents Cost-TrustFL, a hierarchical federated learning framework that jointly optimizes model performance and communication costs while providing robust defense against poisoning attacks. We propose a gradient-based approximate Shapley value computation method that reduces the complexity from exponential to linear, enabling lightweight reputation evaluation. Our cost-aware aggregation strategy prioritizes intra-cloud communication to minimize expensive cross-cloud data transfers. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and FEMNIST datasets demonstrate that Cost-TrustFL achieves 86.7% accuracy under 30% malicious clients while reducing communication costs by 32% compared to baseline methods. The framework maintains stable performance across varying non-IID degrees and attack intensities, making it practical for real-world multi-cloud deployments.

Abstract: Simultaneous load forecasting across multiple entities (e.g., regions, buildings) is crucial for the efficient, reliable, and cost-effective operation of power systems. Accurate load forecasting is a challenging problem due to the inherent uncertainties in load demand, dynamic changes in consumption patterns, and correlations among entities. Multi-task learning has emerged as a powerful machine learning approach that enables the simultaneous learning across multiple related problems. However, its application to load forecasting remains underexplored and is limited to offline learning-based methods, which cannot capture changes in consumption patterns. This paper presents an adaptive multi-task learning method for probabilistic load forecasting. The proposed method can dynamically adapt to changes in consumption patterns and correlations among entities. In addition, the techniques presented provide reliable probabilistic predictions for loads of multiples entities and assess load uncertainties. Specifically, the method is based on vectorvalued hidden Markov models and uses a recursive process to update the model parameters and provide predictions with the most recent parameters. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using datasets that contain the load demand of multiple entities and exhibit diverse and dynamic consumption patterns. The experimental results show that the presented techniques outperform existing methods both in terms of forecasting performance and uncertainty assessment.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative models demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across various image synthesis tasks, yet their tendency to replicate and amplify dataset biases remains poorly understood. Although previous research has viewed bias amplification as an inherent characteristic of diffusion models, this work provides the first analysis of how sampling algorithms and their hyperparameters influence bias amplification. We empirically demonstrate that samplers for diffusion models -- commonly optimized for sample quality and speed -- have a significant and measurable effect on bias amplification. Through controlled studies with models trained on Biased MNIST, Multi-Color MNIST and BFFHQ, and with Stable Diffusion, we show that sampling hyperparameters can induce both bias reduction and amplification, even when the trained model is fixed.

Abstract: This work demonstrates that neural operator learning provides a powerful and flexible framework for building fast, accurate emulators of moving boundary systems, enabling their integration into digital twin platforms. To this end, a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture is employed to construct an efficient surrogate model for moving boundary problems in single-phase Darcy flow through porous media. The surrogate enables rapid and accurate approximation of complex flow dynamics and is coupled with an Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) algorithm to solve Bayesian inverse problems.
  The proposed inversion framework is demonstrated by estimating the permeability and porosity of fibre reinforcements for composite materials manufactured via the Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM) process. Using both synthetic and experimental in-process data, the DeepONet surrogate accelerates inversion by several orders of magnitude compared with full-model EKI. This computational efficiency enables real-time, accurate, high-resolution estimation of local variations in permeability, porosity, and other parameters, thereby supporting effective monitoring and control of RTM processes, as well as other applications involving moving boundary flows. Unlike prior approaches for RTM inversion that learn mesh-dependent mappings, the proposed neural operator generalises across spatial and temporal domains, enabling evaluation at arbitrary sensor configurations without retraining, and represents a significant step toward practical industrial deployment of digital twins.

Abstract: Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (Neural SDEs) provide a principled framework for modeling continuous-time stochastic processes and have been widely adopted in fields ranging from physics to finance. Recent advances suggest that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) offer a promising solution to learning the complex path distributions induced by SDEs. However, a critical bottleneck lies in designing a discriminator that faithfully captures temporal dependencies while remaining computationally efficient. Prior works have explored Neural Controlled Differential Equations (CDEs) as discriminators due to their ability to model continuous-time dynamics, but such architectures suffer from high computational costs and exacerbate the instability of adversarial training. To address these limitations, we introduce HGAN-SDEs, a novel GAN-based framework that leverages Neural Hermite functions to construct a structured and efficient discriminator. Hermite functions provide an expressive yet lightweight basis for approximating path-level dynamics, enabling both reduced runtime complexity and improved training stability. We establish the universal approximation property of our framework for a broad class of SDE-driven distributions and theoretically characterize its convergence behavior. Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world systems demonstrate that HGAN-SDEs achieve superior sample quality and learning efficiency compared to existing generative models for SDEs

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures achieve parameter efficiency through conditional computation, yet contemporary designs suffer from two fundamental limitations: structural parameter isolation that causes catastrophic forgetting, and instruction-overfitting that degrades performance in instruction-free scenarios. We propose CDSP-MoE (Conflict-Driven Subspace Pruning MoE), a framework that addresses these issues through a paradigm shift from isolated expert containers to dynamic expert instantiation within a shared physical subspace. Grounded in the Universal Weight Subspace Hypothesis, CDSP-MoE maintains a super-complete parameter backbone where logical experts are carved out via learnable topology masks. Unlike prior work that uses gradient conflict for token reassignment or optimization surgery, we leverage it as a structural supervisory signal: a Lagged Gradient Game penalizes interfering connections in the shared manifold, enabling the topology to spontaneously prune conflicting pathways and evolve interpretable modular structures. Experimental results demonstrate that CDSP-MoE achieves robust content-driven routing without human-defined task labels, maintaining semantic specialization even under strict blind inference protocols where explicit instructions are absent.

Abstract: Tabular data serves as the backbone of modern data analysis and scientific research. While Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) have significantly improved natural language interaction with such structured data, they often fall short in handling the complex, multi-step reasoning and robust code execution required for real-world table tasks. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising avenue to enhance these capabilities, yet its application in the tabular domain faces three critical hurdles: the scarcity of high-quality agentic trajectories with closed-loop code execution and environment feedback on diverse table structures, the extreme heterogeneity of feedback signals ranging from rigid SQL execution to open-ended data interpretation, and the risk of catastrophic forgetting of general knowledge during vertical specialization. To overcome these challenges and unlock advanced reasoning on complex tables, we introduce \textbf{TableGPT-R1}, a specialized tabular model built on a systematic RL framework. Our approach integrates a comprehensive data engineering pipeline that synthesizes difficulty-stratified agentic trajectories for both supervised alignment and RL rollouts, a task-adaptive reward system that combines rule-based verification with a criteria-injected reward model and incorporates process-level step reward shaping with behavioral regularization, and a multi-stage training framework that progressively stabilizes reasoning before specializing in table-specific tasks. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TableGPT-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance on authoritative benchmarks, significantly outperforming baseline models while retaining robust general capabilities.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Data heterogeneity is a significant challenge in modern federated learning (FL) as it creates variance in local model updates, causing the aggregated global model to shift away from the true global optimum. Partial client participation in FL further exacerbates this issue by skewing the aggregation of local models towards the data distribution of participating clients. This creates additional variance in the global model updates, causing the global model to converge away from the optima of the global objective. These variances lead to instability in FL training, which degrades global model performance and slows down FL training. While existing literature primarily focuses on addressing data heterogeneity, the impact of partial client participation has received less attention. In this paper, we propose FedDPC, a novel FL method, designed to improve FL training and global model performance by mitigating both data heterogeneity and partial client participation. FedDPC addresses these issues by projecting each local update onto the previous global update, thereby controlling variance in both local and global updates. To further accelerate FL training, FedDPC employs adaptive scaling for each local update before aggregation. Extensive experiments on image classification tasks with multiple heterogeneously partitioned datasets validate the effectiveness of FedDPC. The results demonstrate that FedDPC outperforms state-of-the-art FL algorithms by achieving faster reduction in training loss and improved test accuracy across communication rounds.

Abstract: Physics-based machine learning blends traditional science with modern data-driven techniques. Rather than relying exclusively on empirical data or predefined equations, this methodology embeds domain knowledge directly into the learning process, resulting in models that are both more accurate and robust. We leverage this paradigm to accelerate simulations of the Zero Degree Calorimeter (ZDC) of the ALICE experiment at CERN. Our method introduces a novel loss function and an output variability-based scaling mechanism, which enhance the model's capability to accurately represent the spatial distribution and morphology of particle showers in detector outputs while mitigating the influence of rare artefacts on the training. Leveraging Normalizing Flows (NFs) in a teacher-student generative framework, we demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms classic data-driven model assimilation but also yields models that are 421 times faster than existing NF implementations in ZDC simulation literature.

Conclusion: PSI引导的聚类是一种原则性、轻量级的机制，能够在标签偏斜下实现鲁棒的个性化联邦学习，有效缓解非IID数据带来的负面影响

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) supports privacy-preserving, decentralized machine learning (ML) model training by keeping data on client devices. However, non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data across clients biases updates and degrades performance. To alleviate these issues, we propose Clust-PSI-PFL, a clustering-based personalized FL framework that uses the Population Stability Index (PSI) to quantify the level of non-IID data. We compute a weighted PSI metric, $WPSI^L$, which we show to be more informative than common non-IID metrics (Hellinger, Jensen-Shannon, and Earth Mover's distance). Using PSI features, we form distributionally homogeneous groups of clients via K-means++; the number of optimal clusters is chosen by a systematic silhouette-based procedure, typically yielding few clusters with modest overhead. Across six datasets (tabular, image, and text modalities), two partition protocols (Dirichlet with parameter $α$ and Similarity with parameter S), and multiple client sizes, Clust-PSI-PFL delivers up to 18% higher global accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines and markedly improves client fairness by a relative improvement of 37% under severe non-IID data. These results establish PSI-guided clustering as a principled, lightweight mechanism for robust PFL under label skew.

Conclusion: Field-Space Attention作为一种紧凑、可解释、有物理基础的构建模块，为下一代地球系统预测和生成建模框架奠定了基础

Abstract: Accurate and physically consistent modeling of Earth system dynamics requires machine-learning architectures that operate directly on continuous geophysical fields and preserve their underlying geometric structure. Here we introduce Field-Space attention, a mechanism for Earth system Transformers that computes attention in the physical domain rather than in a learned latent space. By maintaining all intermediate representations as continuous fields on the sphere, the architecture enables interpretable internal states and facilitates the enforcement of scientific constraints. The model employs a fixed, non-learned multiscale decomposition and learns structure-preserving deformations of the input field, allowing coherent integration of coarse and fine-scale information while avoiding the optimization instabilities characteristic of standard single-scale Vision Transformers. Applied to global temperature super-resolution on a HEALPix grid, Field-Space Transformers converge more rapidly and stably than conventional Vision Transformers and U-Net baselines, while requiring substantially fewer parameters. The explicit preservation of field structure throughout the network allows physical and statistical priors to be embedded directly into the architecture, yielding improved fidelity and reliability in data-driven Earth system modeling. These results position Field-Space Attention as a compact, interpretable, and physically grounded building block for next-generation Earth system prediction and generative modeling frameworks.

Abstract: We present GeoTransolver, a Multiscale Geometry-Aware Physics Attention Transformer for CAE that replaces standard attention with GALE, coupling physics-aware self-attention on learned state slices with cross-attention to a shared geometry/global/boundary-condition context computed from multi-scale ball queries (inspired by DoMINO) and reused in every block. Implemented and released in NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo, GeoTransolver persistently projects geometry, global and boundary condition parameters into physical state spaces to anchor latent computations to domain structure and operating regimes. We benchmark GeoTransolver on DrivAerML, Luminary SHIFT-SUV, and Luminary SHIFT-Wing, comparing against Domino, Transolver (as released in PhysicsNeMo), and literature-reported AB-UPT, and evaluate drag/lift R2 and Relative L1 errors for field variables. GeoTransolver delivers better accuracy, improved robustness to geometry/regime shifts, and favorable data efficiency; we include ablations on DrivAerML and qualitative results such as contour plots and design trends for the best GeoTransolver models. By unifying multiscale geometry-aware context with physics-based attention in a scalable transformer, GeoTransolver advances operator learning for high-fidelity surrogate modeling across complex, irregular domains and non-linear physical regimes.

TL;DR: BRIDGE通过两阶段框架解决了大模型与小模型间的知识蒸馏难题：首先使用中型教师助理在有限数据上学习黑盒教师知识，然后基于此生成完整数据集训练小模型，显著降低API成本并提升小模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从大型专有模型（如GPT-4）到小型可部署模型（参数少于1B）的知识蒸馏中面临的核心问题：教师与学生间1000倍的容量差距导致直接转移效果不佳，而API成本又限制大规模数据收集。

Method: 两阶段框架：1）预算受限阶段：中型教师助理（约7B参数）在严格限制的数据子集（3-5%）上向黑盒教师学习，使用零API成本管道选择数据，平衡熵难度和语义多样性；2）监督增强阶段：利用教师查询昂贵而TA推理免费的不对称性，让精炼后的TA生成完整数据集的合成推理过程来训练小模型。关键使用指令调优课程来建立小模型的行为对齐。

Result: 在医疗、法律和金融基准测试中，BRIDGE使学生模型性能提升28-41%，与专有教师的能力差距缩小12-16%，同时使用10倍更少的教师查询。值得注意的是，BRIDGE突破传统的成本-性能边界，仅用5%的资源就超过了使用100%预算的直接蒸馏基线方法。

Conclusion: BRIDGE有效解决了容量-预算困境，通过战略性中间蒸馏实现了在不增加成本的情况下显著提升小模型性能，为从大型专有模型向微型可部署模型的知识转移提供了实用且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Distilling knowledge from large proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4) to tiny deployable models (less than 1B parameters) faces a critical capacity-budget trap: the 1000x capacity gap between teachers and students prevents effective direct transfer, while API costs prohibit extensive data collection. We introduce BRIDGE (Budget-Aware Reasoning via Intermediate Distillation), a two-phase framework that resolves these constraints through strategic intermediation and budget asymmetry. In Phase 1, a mid-sized Teacher Assistant (TA; e.g., about 7B) learns from the black-box teacher on a strictly limited subset of data (e.g., 3-5%), selected via a zero-API-cost pipeline that balances entropic difficulty and semantic diversity using only local TA inference. In Phase 2, we exploit this asymmetry-teacher queries are expensive, whereas TA inference is free to amplify supervision: the refined TA generates synthetic rationales for the full dataset to train the tiny student. Crucially, we apply an instruction-tuning curriculum to establish behavioral alignment in the tiny student before transferring reasoning. Our theoretical analysis shows that BRIDGE yields tighter generalization bounds than direct distillation when data is abundant. Experiments across medical, legal, and financial benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements: BRIDGE delivers student performance gains of 28-41%, closing the capability gap with proprietary teachers by 12-16% while using 10x fewer teacher queries. Notably, BRIDGE defies the conventional cost-performance frontier, surpassing direct distillation baselines that use 100% of the budget while consuming only 5% of the resources.

*Rui Pan,Zhuofu Chen,Ravi Netravali*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FailFast是一个使用扩散大语言模型作为草稿器的推测解码框架，通过动态调整推测长度实现高效加速，在困难区域快速失败以降低计算成本，在简单区域大胆扩展以提升吞吐量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型虽然能实现快速并行token生成，但单独使用时存在效率-质量权衡问题。研究表明，如果巧妙利用dLLMs的特性，可以成为自回归验证器中理想的草稿器，通过并行解码降低拒绝风险，实现长草稿的大幅加速。

Method: FailFast框架的核心是利用dLLMs并行生成token的能力，动态调整推测长度：在难以推测的区域快速失败以最小化计算延迟，在易于推测的区域积极扩展草稿长度以降低验证延迟，最多能一次性推测并接受70个token。

Result: 在不进行任何微调的情况下，FailFast实现了AR LLMs的无损失加速：相比原始解码最高加速4.9倍，相比最佳naive dLLM草稿器加速1.7倍，相比EAGLE-3加速1.4倍，在不同模型和工作负载上均表现优异。

Conclusion: FailFast证明了dLLMs作为推测解码草稿器的巨大潜力，通过动态适应性机制解决了效率-质量权衡问题，为高效的大语言模型解码提供了新的解决方案，目前已开源供研究使用。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) offer fast, parallel token generation, but their standalone use is plagued by an inherent efficiency-quality tradeoff. We show that, if carefully applied, the attributes of dLLMs can actually be a strength for drafters in speculative decoding with autoregressive (AR) verifiers. Our core insight is that dLLM's speed from parallel decoding drastically lowers the risk of costly rejections, providing a practical mechanism to effectively realize the (elusive) lengthy drafts that lead to large speedups with speculative decoding. We present FailFast, a dLLM-based speculative decoding framework that realizes this approach by dynamically adapting its speculation length. It "fails fast" by spending minimal compute in hard-to-speculate regions to shrink speculation latency and "wins big" by aggressively extending draft lengths in easier regions to reduce verification latency (in many cases, speculating and accepting 70 tokens at a time!). Without any fine-tuning, FailFast delivers lossless acceleration of AR LLMs and achieves up to 4.9$\times$ speedup over vanilla decoding, 1.7$\times$ over the best naive dLLM drafter, and 1.4$\times$ over EAGLE-3 across diverse models and workloads. We open-source FailFast at https://github.com/ruipeterpan/failfast.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用电子商务网站的点击流数据预测用户会话是否受挫，通过XGBoost和LSTM模型达到约90-91%准确率，其中LSTM效果略优，且利用前20-30次交互即可可靠预测挫败感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动应用和网站的流畅体验对商业至关重要；用户完成任务的挫败感会导致销售损失和投诉。研究旨在利用真实点击流数据预测会话是否挫败，以帮助企业及时识别并改善用户旅程。

Method: 基于特定规则定义挫败感（如暴力点击、来回导航、购物车流失、搜索困难、长时漫游），将规则应用于540万原始点击流事件（304,881个会话）生成标签。从每个会话构建表格特征训练标准分类器（如XGBoost），并利用完整事件序列训练判别性LSTM分类器。

Result: XGBoost准确率约90%，ROC AUC 0.9579；LSTM表现最佳，准确率约91%，ROC AUC 0.9705。研究同时显示，LSTM仅需前20-30次交互即可可靠预测挫败感。

Conclusion: 基于点击流数据的机器学习模型能有效预测用户挫败会话，其中LSTM利用序列信息表现更佳，且早期预测可行，为企业提供了实时的挫败检测工具，有助于优化用户体验和减少商业损失。

Abstract: Many businesses depend on their mobile apps and websites, so user frustration while trying to complete a task on these channels can cause lost sales and complaints. In this research, I use clickstream data from a real e-commerce site to predict whether a session is frustrated or not. Frustration is defined using certain rules based on rage bursts, back and forth navigation (U turns), cart churn, search struggle, and long wandering sessions, and applies these rules to 5.4 million raw clickstream events (304,881 sessions). From each session, I build tabular features and train standard classifier models. I also use the full event sequence to train a discriminative LSTM classifier. XGBoost reaches about 90% accuracy, ROC AUC of 0.9579, while the LSTM performs best with about 91% accuracy and a ROC AUC of 0.9705. Finally, the research shows that with only the first 20 to 30 interactions, the LSTM already predicts frustration reliably.

Motivation: 标准强化学习算法忽视部署后机器学习会影响环境动态的问题，而监督学习中的performative设置已有所研究，但RL中的对应研究不足。

Method: 证明了RL中performative版本的性能差异引理和策略梯度定理，提出PePG算法，并分别在softmax参数化和有/无熵正则化下分析其收敛性。

Result: PePG能收敛到performatively最优策略（在自身引起的分布偏移下保持最优），在标准performative RL环境中优于标准策略梯度算法和现有追求稳定性的performative RL算法。

Conclusion: PePG是首个能实现performative最优性的RL策略梯度算法，显著扩展了先前仅实现稳定性的工作。

Abstract: Post-deployment machine learning algorithms often influence the environments they act in, and thus shift the underlying dynamics that the standard reinforcement learning (RL) methods ignore. While designing optimal algorithms in this performative setting has recently been studied in supervised learning, the RL counterpart remains under-explored. In this paper, we prove the performative counterparts of the performance difference lemma and the policy gradient theorem in RL, and further introduce the Performative Policy Gradient algorithm (PePG). PePG is the first policy gradient algorithm designed to account for performativity in RL. Under softmax parametrisation, and also with and without entropy regularisation, we prove that PePG converges to performatively optimal policies, i.e. policies that remain optimal under the distribution shifts induced by themselves. Thus, PePG significantly extends the prior works in Performative RL that achieves performative stability but not optimality. Furthermore, our empirical analysis on standard performative RL environments validate that PePG outperforms standard policy gradient algorithms and the existing performative RL algorithms aiming for stability.

Abstract: Recurrent off-policy deep reinforcement learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance but are often sidelined due to their high computational demands. In response, we introduce RISE (Recurrent Integration via Simplified Encodings), a novel approach that can leverage recurrent networks in any image-based off-policy RL setting without significant computational overheads via using both learnable and non-learnable encoder layers. When integrating RISE into leading non-recurrent off-policy RL algorithms, we observe a 35.6% human-normalized interquartile mean (IQM) performance improvement across the Atari benchmark. We analyze various implementation strategies to highlight the versatility and potential of our proposed framework.

Abstract: Large-scale autoregressive models pretrained on next-token prediction and finetuned with reinforcement learning (RL) have achieved unprecedented success on many problem domains. During RL, these models explore by generating new outputs, one token at a time. However, sampling actions token-by-token can result in highly inefficient learning, particularly when rewards are sparse. Here, we show that it is possible to overcome this problem by acting and exploring within the internal representations of an autoregressive model. Specifically, to discover temporally-abstract actions, we introduce a higher-order, non-causal sequence model whose outputs control the residual stream activations of a base autoregressive model. On grid world and MuJoCo-based tasks with hierarchical structure, we find that the higher-order model learns to compress long activation sequence chunks onto internal controllers. Critically, each controller executes a sequence of behaviorally meaningful actions that unfold over long timescales and are accompanied with a learned termination condition, such that composing multiple controllers over time leads to efficient exploration on novel tasks. We show that direct internal controller reinforcement, a process we term "internal RL", enables learning from sparse rewards in cases where standard RL finetuning fails. Our results demonstrate the benefits of latent action generation and reinforcement in autoregressive models, suggesting internal RL as a promising avenue for realizing hierarchical RL within foundation models.

Motivation: 时间序列预测在许多领域至关重要，可解释性对建立用户信任和满足透明度要求很关键。SHAP作为流行的可解释AI框架，缺乏对时间序列的高效实现，且生成反事实时经常假设特征独立

Method: 提出SHAPformer，基于Transformer架构，通过注意力操作实现对特征子集的选择性预测，无需采样即可生成解释

Conclusion: SHAPformer是一种准确、快速且无需采样的可解释时间序列预测模型，能够为规划决策提供透明、高效的解释

Abstract: Time-series forecasts are essential for planning and decision-making in many domains. Explainability is key to building user trust and meeting transparency requirements. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) is a popular explainable AI framework, but it lacks efficient implementations for time series and often assumes feature independence when sampling counterfactuals. We introduce SHAPformer, an accurate, fast and sampling-free explainable time-series forecasting model based on the Transformer architecture. It leverages attention manipulation to make predictions based on feature subsets. SHAPformer generates explanations in under one second, several orders of magnitude faster than the SHAP Permutation Explainer. On synthetic data with ground truth explanations, SHAPformer provides explanations that are true to the data. Applied to real-world electrical load data, it achieves competitive predictive performance and delivers meaningful local and global insights, such as identifying the past load as the key predictor and revealing a distinct model behavior during the Christmas period.

Abstract: Hand-tagged training data is essential to many machine learning tasks. However, training data quality control has received little attention in the literature, despite data quality varying considerably with the tagging exercise. We propose methods to evaluate and enhance the quality of hand-tagged training data using statistical approaches to measure tagging consistency and agreement. We show that agreement metrics give more reliable results if recorded over multiple iterations of tagging, where declining variance in such recordings is an indicator of increasing data quality. We also show one way a tagging project can collect high-quality training data without requiring multiple tags for every work item, and that a tagger burn-in period may not be sufficient for minimizing tagger errors.

Abstract: Neural networks trained with gradient descent often learn solutions of increasing complexity over time, a phenomenon known as simplicity bias. Despite being widely observed across architectures, existing theoretical treatments lack a unifying framework. We present a theoretical framework that explains a simplicity bias arising from saddle-to-saddle learning dynamics for a general class of neural networks, incorporating fully-connected, convolutional, and attention-based architectures. Here, simple means expressible with few hidden units, i.e., hidden neurons, convolutional kernels, or attention heads. Specifically, we show that linear networks learn solutions of increasing rank, ReLU networks learn solutions with an increasing number of kinks, convolutional networks learn solutions with an increasing number of convolutional kernels, and self-attention models learn solutions with an increasing number of attention heads. By analyzing fixed points, invariant manifolds, and dynamics of gradient descent learning, we show that saddle-to-saddle dynamics operates by iteratively evolving near an invariant manifold, approaching a saddle, and switching to another invariant manifold. Our analysis also illuminates the effects of data distribution and weight initialization on the duration and number of plateaus in learning, dissociating previously confounding factors. Overall, our theory offers a framework for understanding when and why gradient descent progressively learns increasingly complex solutions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Federated edge learning (FEEL) enables wireless devices to collaboratively train a centralised model without sharing raw data, but repeated uplink transmission of model updates makes communication the dominant bottleneck. Over-the-air (OTA) aggregation alleviates this by exploiting the superposition property of the wireless channel, enabling simultaneous transmission and merging communication with computation. Digital OTA schemes extend this principle by incorporating the robustness of conventional digital communication, but current designs remain limited in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. This work proposes a learned digital OTA framework that improves recovery accuracy, convergence behaviour, and robustness to challenging SNR conditions while maintaining the same uplink overhead as state-of-the-art methods. The design integrates an unsourced random access (URA) codebook with vector quantisation and AMP-DA-Net, an unrolled approximate message passing (AMP)-style decoder trained end-to-end with the digital codebook and parameter server local training statistics. The proposed design extends OTA aggregation beyond averaging to a broad class of symmetric functions, including trimmed means and majority-based rules. Experiments on highly heterogeneous device datasets and varying numbers of active devices show that the proposed design extends reliable digital OTA operation by more than 10 dB into low SNR regimes while matching or improving performance across the full SNR range. The learned decoder remains effective under message corruption and nonlinear aggregation, highlighting the broader potential of end-to-end learned design for digital OTA communication in FEEL.

Abstract: High-fidelity spectrum cartography is pivotal for spectrum management and wireless situational awareness, yet it remains a challenging ill-posed inverse problem due to the sparsity and irregularity of observations. Furthermore, existing approaches often decouple reconstruction from sensing, lacking a principled mechanism for informative sampling. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a unified diffusion-based Bayesian framework that jointly addresses spectrum reconstruction and active sensing. We formulate the reconstruction task as a conditional generation process driven by a learned diffusion prior. Specifically, we derive tractable, closed-form posterior transition kernels for the reverse diffusion process, which enforce consistency with both linear Gaussian and non-linear quantized measurements. Leveraging the intrinsic probabilistic nature of diffusion models, we further develop an uncertainty-aware active sampling strategy. This strategy quantifies reconstruction uncertainty to adaptively guide sensing agents toward the most informative locations, thereby maximizing spectral efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art interpolation, sparsity-based, and deep learning baselines in terms of reconstruction accuracy, sampling efficiency, and robustness to low-bit quantization.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: High-mobility wireless communication systems suffer from severe Doppler spread and multi-path delay, which degrade the reliability and spectral efficiency of conventional modulation schemes. Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation offers strong robustness in such environments by representing symbols in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, while faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling can further enhance spectral efficiency through intentional symbol packing. Meanwhile, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) provide a promising means to improve link quality via passive beamforming. Motivated by these advantages, we propose a novel RIS-empowered OTFS modulation with FTN signaling (RIS-OTFS-FTN) scheme. First, we establish a unified DD-domain input-output relationship that jointly accounts for RIS passive beamforming, FTN-induced inter-symbol interference, and DD-domain channel characteristics. Based on this model, we provide comprehensive analytical performance for the frame error rate, spectral efficiency, and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), etc. Furthermore, a practical RIS phase adjustment strategy with quantized phase selection is designed to maximize the effective channel gain. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations under a standardized extended vehicular A (EVA) channel model validate the theoretical results and provide key insights into the trade-offs among spectral efficiency, PAPR, input back-off (IBO), and error performance, with some interesting insights.The proposed RIS-OTFS-FTN scheme demonstrates notable performance gains in both reliability and spectral efficiency, offering a viable solution for future high-mobility and spectrum-constrained wireless systems.

Abstract: Pinching antennas enable dynamic control of electromagnetic wave propagation through reconfigurable radiating structures, but selecting an optimal subset of antennas remains a combinatorial problem with exponential complexity. This letter considers antenna subset selection for a waveguide-fed pinching antenna array serving ground users under a time-division access scheme. The achievable rate depends on the coherent superposition of the effective complex channel gains and is therefore highly sensitive to the relative phase alignment of the activated antennas. To address the prohibitive complexity of exhaustive search, we propose a Viterbi state selection (VSS) algorithm that exploits the phase structure of the combined received signal. The trellis state is defined by a quantized representation of the phase of the accumulated complex gain, and a Viterbi-based survivor rule is used to prune dominated antenna subsets across stages. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the same antenna selection and rate as exhaustive search, while reducing the computational complexity from exponential to polynomial in the number of available antennas.

Abstract: Analyzing causality in multivariate systems involves establishing how information is generated, distributed and combined, and thus requires tools that capture interactions beyond pairwise relations. Higher-order information theory provides such tools. In particular, Partial Information Decomposition (PID) allows the decomposition of the information that a set of sources provides about a target into redundant, unique, and synergistic components. Yet the mathematical connection between such higher-order information-theoretic measures and causal structure remains undeveloped. Here we establish the first theoretical correspondence between PID components and causal structure in both Bayesian networks and hypergraphs. We first show that in Bayesian networks unique information precisely characterizes direct causal neighbors, while synergy identifies collider relationships. This establishes a localist causal discovery paradigm in which the structure surrounding each variable can be recovered from its immediate informational footprint, eliminating the need for global search over graph space. Extending these results to higher-order systems, we prove that PID signatures in Bayesian hypergraphs differentiate parents, children, co-heads, and co-tails, revealing a higher-order collider effect unique to multi-tail hyperedges. We also present procedures by which our results can be used to characterize systematically the causal structure of Bayesian networks and hypergraphs. Our results position PID as a rigorous, model-agnostic foundation for inferring both pairwise and higher-order causal structure, and introduce a fundamentally local information-theoretic viewpoint on causal discovery.

Abstract: The distribution of relief supplies to shelters is a critical aspect of post-disaster humanitarian logistics. In major disasters, prepositioned supplies often fall short of meeting all demands. We address the problem of planning vehicle routes from a distribution center to shelters while allocating limited relief supplies. To balance efficiency and equity, we formulate a bi-objective problem: minimizing a Gini-index-based measure of inequity in unsatisfied demand for fair distribution and minimizing total travel time for timely delivery. We propose a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model and use the $ε$-constraint method to handle the bi-objective nature. By deriving mathematical properties of the optimal solution, we introduce valid inequalities and design an algorithm for optimal delivery allocations given feasible vehicle routes. A branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm is developed to solve the problem efficiently. Computational tests on realistic datasets from a past earthquake in Van, Turkey, and predicted data for Istanbul's Kartal region show that the B&P algorithm significantly outperforms commercial MIP solvers. Our bi-objective approach reduces aid distribution inequity by 34% without compromising efficiency. Results indicate that when time constraints are very loose or tight, lexicographic optimization prioritizing demand coverage over fairness is effective. For moderately restrictive time constraints, a balanced approach is essential to avoid inequitable outcomes.

Abstract: Recent research has explored using very large language models (LLMs) as proxies for humans in tasks such as simulation, surveys, and studies. While LLMs do not possess a human psychology, they often can emulate human behaviors with sufficiently high fidelity to drive simulations to test human behavioral hypotheses, exhibiting more nuance and range than the rule-based agents often employed in behavioral economics. One key area of interest is the effect of personality on decision making, but the requirement that a prompt must be created for every tested personality profile introduces experimental overhead and degrades replicability. To address this issue, we leverage interpolative decoding, representing each dimension of personality as a pair of opposed prompts and employing an interpolation parameter to simulate behavior along the dimension. We show that interpolative decoding reliably modulates scores along each of the Big Five dimensions. We then show how interpolative decoding causes LLMs to mimic human decision-making behavior in economic games, replicating results from human psychological research. Finally, we present preliminary results of our efforts to ``twin'' individual human players in a collaborative game through systematic search for points in interpolation space that cause the system to replicate actions taken by the human subject.

Abstract: This paper presents an approach developed to address the PlantClef 2025 challenge, which consists of a fine-grained multi-label species identification, over high-resolution images. Our solution focused on employing class prototypes obtained from the training dataset as a proxy guidance for training a segmentation Vision Transformer (ViT) on the test set images. To obtain these representations, the proposed method extracts features from training dataset images and create clusters, by applying K-Means, with $K$ equals to the number of classes in the dataset. The segmentation model is a customized narrow ViT, built by replacing the patch embedding layer with a frozen DinoV2, pre-trained on the training dataset for individual species classification. This model is trained to reconstruct the class prototypes of the training dataset from the test dataset images. We then use this model to obtain attention scores that enable to identify and localize areas of interest and consequently guide the classification process. The proposed approach enabled a domain-adaptation from multi-class identification with individual species, into multi-label classification from high-resolution vegetation plots. Our method achieved fifth place in the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge on the private leaderboard, with an F1 score of 0.33331. Besides that, in absolute terms our method scored 0.03 lower than the top-performing submission, suggesting that it may achieved competitive performance in the benchmark task.

Abstract: Intra-class variability is given according to the significance in the degree of dissimilarity between images within a class. In that sense, depending on its intensity, intra-class variability can hinder the learning process for DL models, specially when such classes are also underrepresented, which is a very common scenario in Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) tasks. This paper proposes a novel method that aims at leveraging classification performance in FGVC tasks by learning fine-grained features via classification of class-wise cluster assignments. Our goal is to apply clustering over each class individually, which can allow to discover pseudo-labels that encodes a latent degree of similarity between images. In turn, those labels can be employed in a hierarchical classification process that allows to learn more fine-grained visual features and thereby mitigating intra-class variability issues. Initial experiments over the PlantNet300k enabled to shed light upon several key points in which future work will have to be developed in order to find more conclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of our method. Our method still achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PlantNet300k dataset even though some of its components haven't been shown to be fully optimized.

Abstract: The integration of embodied agents into human environments demands embodied social intelligence: reasoning over both social norms and physical constraints. However, existing evaluations fail to address this integration, as they are limited to either disembodied social reasoning (e.g., in text) or socially-agnostic physical tasks. Both approaches fail to assess an agent's ability to integrate and trade off both physical and social constraints within a realistic, embodied context. To address this challenge, we introduce Spatially Situated Social Intelligence Test (S$^{3}$IT), a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate embodied social intelligence. It is centered on a novel and challenging seat-ordering task, requiring an agent to arrange seating in a 3D environment for a group of large language model-driven (LLM-driven) NPCs with diverse identities, preferences, and intricate interpersonal relationships. Our procedurally extensible framework generates a vast and diverse scenario space with controllable difficulty, compelling the agent to acquire preferences through active dialogue, perceive the environment via autonomous exploration, and perform multi-objective optimization within a complex constraint network. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on S$^{3}$IT and found that they still struggle with this problem, showing an obvious gap compared with the human baseline. Results imply that LLMs have deficiencies in spatial intelligence, yet simultaneously demonstrate their ability to achieve near human-level competence in resolving conflicts that possess explicit textual cues.

Abstract: Symmetry is fundamental to understanding physical systems, and at the same time, can improve performance and sample efficiency in machine learning. Both pursuits require knowledge of the underlying symmetries in data. To address this, we propose learning symmetries directly from data via flow matching on Lie groups. We formulate symmetry discovery as learning a distribution over a larger hypothesis group, such that the learned distribution matches the symmetries observed in data. Relative to previous works, our method, \lieflow, is more flexible in terms of the types of groups it can discover and requires fewer assumptions. Experiments on 2D and 3D point clouds demonstrate the successful discovery of discrete groups, including reflections by flow matching over the complex domain. We identify a key challenge where the symmetric arrangement of the target modes causes ``last-minute convergence,'' where samples remain stationary until relatively late in the flow, and introduce a novel interpolation scheme for flow matching for symmetry discovery.

Abstract: Learning from videos offers a promising path toward generalist robots by providing rich visual and temporal priors beyond what real robot datasets contain. While existing video generative models produce impressive visual predictions, they are difficult to translate into low-level actions. Conversely, latent-action models better align videos with actions, but they typically operate at the single-step level and lack high-level planning capabilities. We bridge this gap by introducing Skill Abstraction from Optical Flow (SOF), a framework that learns latent skills from large collections of action-free videos. Our key idea is to learn a latent skill space through an intermediate representation based on optical flow that captures motion information aligned with both video dynamics and robot actions. By learning skills in this flow-based latent space, SOF enables high-level planning over video-derived skills and allows for easier translation of these skills into actions. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves performance in both multitask and long-horizon settings, demonstrating the ability to acquire and compose skills directly from raw visual data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着气候变化加剧，灾害和极端天气事件（如热浪、暴雨、野火、飓风洪水）日益频繁和强烈。快速响应灾害的关键在于准确、迅速地识别灾害位置，以支持决策和资源分配。

Method: 提出ProbGLC方法，将概率性地理定位模型和确定性地理定位模型结合到一个统一框架中，既能通过不确定性量化增强模型可解释性，又能达到先进的跨视角地理定位性能。该方法具备处理多种灾害事件跨视角定位的能力，并提供概率分布和可定位性评分等独特特征。

Abstract: As Earth's climate changes, it is impacting disasters and extreme weather events across the planet. Record-breaking heat waves, drenching rainfalls, extreme wildfires, and widespread flooding during hurricanes are all becoming more frequent and more intense. Rapid and efficient response to disaster events is essential for climate resilience and sustainability. A key challenge in disaster response is to accurately and quickly identify disaster locations to support decision-making and resources allocation. In this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Cross-view Geolocalization approach, called ProbGLC, exploring new pathways towards generative location awareness for rapid disaster response. Herein, we combine probabilistic and deterministic geolocalization models into a unified framework to simultaneously enhance model explainability (via uncertainty quantification) and achieve state-of-the-art geolocalization performance. Designed for rapid diaster response, the ProbGLC is able to address cross-view geolocalization across multiple disaster events as well as to offer unique features of probabilistic distribution and localizability score. To evaluate the ProbGLC, we conduct extensive experiments on two cross-view disaster datasets (i.e., MultiIAN and SAGAINDisaster), consisting diverse cross-view imagery pairs of multiple disaster types (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires, floods, to tornadoes). Preliminary results confirms the superior geolocalization accuracy (i.e., 0.86 in Acc@1km and 0.97 in Acc@25km) and model explainability (i.e., via probabilistic distributions and localizability scores) of the proposed ProbGLC approach, highlighting the great potential of leveraging generative cross-view approach to facilitate location awareness for better and faster disaster response.

Abstract: Content moderation at scale remains one of the most pressing challenges in today's digital ecosystem, where billions of user- and AI-generated artifacts must be continuously evaluated for policy violations. Although recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for policy-grounded moderation, the practical challenges of training these systems to achieve expert-level accuracy in real-world settings remain largely unexplored, particularly in regimes characterized by label sparsity, evolving policy definitions, and the need for nuanced reasoning beyond shallow pattern matching. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical investigation of scaling reinforcement learning (RL) for content classification, systematically evaluating multiple RL training recipes and reward-shaping strategies-including verifiable rewards and LLM-as-judge frameworks-to transform general-purpose language models into specialized, policy-aligned classifiers across three real-world content moderation tasks. Our findings provide actionable insights for industrial-scale moderation systems, demonstrating that RL exhibits sigmoid-like scaling behavior in which performance improves smoothly with increased training data, rollouts, and optimization steps before gradually saturating. Moreover, we show that RL substantially improves performance on tasks requiring complex policy-grounded reasoning while achieving up to 100x higher data efficiency than supervised fine-tuning, making it particularly effective in domains where expert annotations are scarce or costly.

Motivation: 现有的LLM临床决策支持系统面临一个关键挑战：如何同时实现高预测准确性并生成与预测一致的解释，而现有方法存在暴露偏差导致解释与预测不匹配的问题。

Method: 提出Reason2Decide两阶段训练框架：第一阶段专注理由生成训练；第二阶段联合训练标签预测和理由生成，并应用计划采样从依赖黄金标签逐步过渡到依赖模型预测。

Result: 在三个医疗数据集评估中，Reason2Decide在预测准确性和理由真实性方面均优于其他微调基线和一些零样本LLM；特别在分类任务中展现了对不同理由来源的鲁棒性；使用LLM生成的理由在预训练中表现良好，减少了对人工标注的依赖；使用比现代基础模型小40倍的模型取得了这些成果。

Conclusion: Reason2Decide框架通过解决暴露偏差和任务分离问题，显著提升了临床决策支持系统的解释和预测一致性；小规模模型的成功部署使临床推理对资源受限的环境更加可行且可解释。

Abstract: Despite the wide adoption of Large Language Models (LLM)s, clinical decision support systems face a critical challenge: achieving high predictive accuracy while generating explanations aligned with the predictions. Current approaches suffer from exposure bias leading to misaligned explanations. We propose Reason2Decide, a two-stage training framework that addresses key challenges in self-rationalization, including exposure bias and task separation. In Stage-1, our model is trained on rationale generation, while in Stage-2, we jointly train on label prediction and rationale generation, applying scheduled sampling to gradually transition from conditioning on gold labels to model predictions. We evaluate Reason2Decide on three medical datasets, including a proprietary triage dataset and public biomedical QA datasets. Across model sizes, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs in prediction (F1) and rationale fidelity (BERTScore, BLEU, LLM-as-a-Judge). In triage, Reason2Decide is rationale source-robust across LLM-generated, nurse-authored, and nurse-post-processed rationales. In our experiments, while using only LLM-generated rationales in Stage-1, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning variants. This indicates that LLM-generated rationales are suitable for pretraining models, reducing reliance on human annotations. Remarkably, Reason2Decide achieves these gains with models 40x smaller than contemporary foundation models, making clinical reasoning more accessible for resource-constrained deployments while still providing explainable decision support.

Abstract: Financial sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in informing investment decisions, assessing market risk, and predicting stock price trends. Existing works in financial sentiment analysis have not considered the impact of stock prices or market feedback on sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose an adaptive framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with real-world stock market feedback to improve sentiment classification in the context of the Indian stock market. The proposed methodology fine-tunes the LLaMA 3.2 3B model using instruction-based learning on the SentiFin dataset. To enhance sentiment predictions, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline is employed that dynamically selects multi-source contextual information based on the cosine similarity of the sentence embeddings. Furthermore, a feedback-driven module is introduced that adjusts the reliability of the source by comparing predicted sentiment with actual next-day stock returns, allowing the system to iteratively adapt to market behavior. To generalize this adaptive mechanism across temporal data, a reinforcement learning agent trained using proximal policy optimization (PPO) is incorporated. The PPO agent learns to optimize source weighting policies based on cumulative reward signals from sentiment-return alignment. Experimental results on NIFTY 50 news headlines collected from 2024 to 2025 demonstrate that the proposed system significantly improves classification accuracy, F1-score, and market alignment over baseline models and static retrieval methods. The results validate the potential of combining instruction-tuned LLMs with dynamic feedback and reinforcement learning for robust, market-aware financial sentiment modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子编辑和优化是多步骤问题，需要在保持化学有效性和结构相似性的同时迭代改善分子特性。传统的分子设计方法往往缺乏可靠性和可解释性，需要一种能够集成推理、工具使用和优化的统一框架。

Method: 提出MolAct框架，采用两阶段训练：首先构建编辑能力（MolEditAgent），然后重用编辑行为进行属性优化（MolOptAgent）。智能体通过多轮交互调用化学工具进行有效性检查、属性评估和相似性控制，利用反馈细化后续编辑。

Result: 在分子编辑任务中，MolEditAgent-7B在添加、删除和替换编辑中分别达到100%、95%和98%的有效率，优于DeepSeek-R1等基线；MolEditAgent-3B接近Qwen3-32B-think等更大模型。在分子优化中，MolOptAgent-7B在LogP指标上超越Claude 3.7，在溶解度上保持竞争力，在所有目标上维持平衡性能。

Conclusion: 将分子设计作为多步骤、工具增强的过程是实现可靠且可解释性改进的关键，MolAct框架在分子编辑和优化任务中展现出强大的性能，为智能体驱动的分子设计提供了新范式。

Abstract: Molecular editing and optimization are multi-step problems that require iteratively improving properties while keeping molecules chemically valid and structurally similar. We frame both tasks as sequential, tool-guided decisions and introduce MolAct, an agentic reinforcement learning framework that employs a two-stage training paradigm: first building editing capability, then optimizing properties while reusing the learned editing behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize molecular design as an Agentic Reinforcement Learning problem, where an LLM agent learns to interleave reasoning, tool-use, and molecular optimization. The framework enables agents to interact in multiple turns, invoking chemical tools for validity checking, property assessment, and similarity control, and leverages their feedback to refine subsequent edits. We instantiate the MolAct framework to train two model families: MolEditAgent for molecular editing tasks and MolOptAgent for molecular optimization tasks. In molecular editing, MolEditAgent-7B delivers 100, 95, and 98 valid add, delete, and substitute edits, outperforming strong closed "thinking" baselines such as DeepSeek-R1; MolEditAgent-3B approaches the performance of much larger open "thinking" models like Qwen3-32B-think. In molecular optimization, MolOptAgent-7B (trained on MolEditAgent-7B) surpasses the best closed "thinking" baseline (e.g., Claude 3.7) on LogP and remains competitive on solubility, while maintaining balanced performance across other objectives. These results highlight that treating molecular design as a multi-step, tool-augmented process is key to reliable and interpretable improvements.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness as zero-shot time series (TS) forecasters. The key challenge lies in tokenizing TS data into textual representations that align with LLMs' pre-trained knowledge. While existing work often relies on fine-tuning specialized modules to bridge this gap, a distinct, yet challenging, paradigm aims to leverage truly off-the-shelf LLMs without any fine-tuning whatsoever, relying solely on strategic tokenization of numerical sequences. The performance of these fully frozen models is acutely sensitive to the textual representation of the input data, as their parameters cannot adapt to distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet highly effective strategy to overcome this brittleness: injecting noise into the raw time series before tokenization. This non-invasive intervention acts as a form of inference-time augmentation, compelling the frozen LLM to extrapolate based on robust underlying temporal patterns rather than superficial numerical artifacts. We theoretically analyze this phenomenon and empirically validate its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks. Notably, to fully eliminate potential biases from data contamination during LLM pre-training, we introduce two novel TS datasets that fall outside all utilized LLMs' pre-training scopes, and consistently observe improved performance. This study provides a further step in directly leveraging off-the-shelf LLMs for time series forecasting.

Abstract: Data centers account for significant global energy consumption and a carbon footprint. The recent increasing demand for edge computing and AI advancements drives the growth of data center storage capacity. Energy efficiency is a cost-effective way to combat climate change, cut energy costs, improve business competitiveness, and promote IT and environmental sustainability. Thus, optimizing data center energy management is the most important factor in the sustainability of the world. Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) is used to represent the operational efficiency of the data center. Predicting PUE using Neural Networks provides an understanding of the effect of each feature on energy consumption, thus enabling targeted modifications of those key features to improve energy efficiency. In this paper, we have developed Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) based PUE prediction model and compared the model performance with GRU. The data set comprises 52,560 samples with 117 features using EnergyPlus, simulating a DC in Singapore. Sets of the most relevant features are selected using the Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) algorithm for different parameter settings. These feature sets are used to find the optimal hyperparameter configuration and train the BiGRU model. The performance of the optimized BiGRU-based PUE prediction model is then compared with that of GRU using mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared metrics.

Abstract: We compare human and large language model (LLM) generalization in the number game, a concept inference task. Using a Bayesian model as an analytical framework, we examined the inductive biases and inference strategies of humans and LLMs. The Bayesian model captured human behavior better than LLMs in that humans flexibly infer rule-based and similarity-based concepts, whereas LLMs rely more on mathematical rules. Humans also demonstrated a few-shot generalization, even from a single example, while LLMs required more samples to generalize. These contrasts highlight the fundamental differences in how humans and LLMs infer and generalize mathematical concepts.

Abstract: Offline Preference-based Reinforcement Learning (PbRL) learns rewards and policies aligned with human preferences without the need for extensive reward engineering and direct interaction with human annotators. However, ensuring safety remains a critical challenge across many domains and tasks. Previous works on safe RL from human feedback (RLHF) first learn reward and cost models from offline data, then use constrained RL to optimize a safe policy. While such an approach works in the contextual bandits settings (LLMs), in long horizon continuous control tasks, errors in rewards and costs accumulate, leading to impairment in performance when used with constrained RL methods. To address these challenges, (a) instead of indirectly learning policies (from rewards and costs), we introduce a framework that learns a policy directly based on pairwise preferences regarding the agent's behavior in terms of rewards, as well as binary labels indicating the safety of trajectory segments; (b) we propose \textsc{PreSa} (Preference and Safety Alignment), a method that combines preference learning module with safety alignment in a constrained optimization problem. This optimization problem is solved within a Lagrangian paradigm that directly learns reward-maximizing safe policy \textit{without explicitly learning reward and cost models}, avoiding the need for constrained RL; (c) we evaluate our approach on continuous control tasks with both synthetic and real human feedback. Empirically, our method successfully learns safe policies with high rewards, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines, and offline safe RL approaches with ground-truth reward and cost.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly advances, especially in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), research focus is shifting from single-modality text processing to the more complex domains of multimodal and embodied AI. Embodied intelligence focuses on training agents within realistic simulated environments, leveraging physical interaction and action feedback rather than conventionally labeled datasets. Yet, most existing simulation platforms remain narrowly designed, each tailored to specific tasks. A versatile, general-purpose training environment that can support everything from low-level embodied navigation to high-level composite activities, such as multi-agent social simulation and human-AI collaboration, remains largely unavailable. To bridge this gap, we introduce TongSIM, a high-fidelity, general-purpose platform for training and evaluating embodied agents. TongSIM offers practical advantages by providing over 100 diverse, multi-room indoor scenarios as well as an open-ended, interaction-rich outdoor town simulation, ensuring broad applicability across research needs. Its comprehensive evaluation framework and benchmarks enable precise assessment of agent capabilities, such as perception, cognition, decision-making, human-robot cooperation, and spatial and social reasoning. With features like customized scenes, task-adaptive fidelity, diverse agent types, and dynamic environmental simulation, TongSIM delivers flexibility and scalability for researchers, serving as a unified platform that accelerates training, evaluation, and advancement toward general embodied intelligence.

Motivation: 当前的VLA模型在边缘设备上的推理延迟较高（3-5Hz），远低于机器人交互所需的20-30Hz帧率，这严重阻碍了VLA模型在动态实时环境中的部署。现有优化方法通常需要大量重新训练或会牺牲模型精度。

Conclusion: ActionFlow能够显著提升VLA模型在边缘设备上的推理速度，使其达到实时操作的要求，为VLA模型在实际机器人应用中的部署提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a unified paradigm for robotic perception and control, enabling emergent generalization and long-horizon task execution. However, their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments is severely hin dered by high inference latency. While smooth robotic interaction requires control frequencies of 20 to 30 Hz, current VLA models typi cally operate at only 3-5 Hz on edge devices due to the memory bound nature of autoregressive decoding. Existing optimizations often require extensive retraining or compromise model accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ActionFlow, a system-level inference framework tailored for resource-constrained edge plat forms. At the core of ActionFlow is a Cross-Request Pipelin ing strategy, a novel scheduler that redefines VLA inference as a macro-pipeline of micro-requests. The strategy intelligently batches memory-bound Decode phases with compute-bound Prefill phases across continuous time steps to maximize hardware utilization. Furthermore, to support this scheduling, we propose a Cross Request State Packed Forward operator and a Unified KV Ring Buffer, which fuse fragmented memory operations into efficient dense computations. Experimental results demonstrate that ActionFlow achieves a 2.55x improvement in FPS on the OpenVLA-7B model without retraining, enabling real-time dy namic manipulation on edge hardware.

Through a high-fidelity case study of a cross-service orchestration task involving Outlook and OneDrive, we identify and address four structural bottlenecks in automated skill generation: the Discovery Gap involving navigation of large tool registries, the Verification Gap regarding grounding tool response structures, the Decomposition Gap which replaces inefficient search with Linear State Anchoring, and the Scaling Gap focused on concurrency and persistence. We demonstrate that by enforcing a scientific methodology of hypothesize, probe, and code, agents can autonomously write robust, production-grade code skills.

Abstract: A global shortage of radiologists has been exacerbated by the significant volume of chest X-ray workloads, particularly in primary care. Although multimodal large language models show promise, existing evaluations predominantly rely on automated metrics or retrospective analyses, lacking rigorous prospective clinical validation. Janus-Pro-CXR (1B), a chest X-ray interpretation system based on DeepSeek Janus-Pro model, was developed and rigorously validated through a multicenter prospective trial (NCT07117266). Our system outperforms state-of-the-art X-ray report generation models in automated report generation, surpassing even larger-scale models including ChatGPT 4o (200B parameters), while demonstrating reliable detection of six clinically critical radiographic findings. Retrospective evaluation confirms significantly higher report accuracy than Janus-Pro and ChatGPT 4o. In prospective clinical deployment, AI assistance significantly improved report quality scores, reduced interpretation time by 18.3% (P < 0.001), and was preferred by a majority of experts in 54.3% of cases. Through lightweight architecture and domain-specific optimization, Janus-Pro-CXR improves diagnostic reliability and workflow efficiency, particularly in resource-constrained settings. The model architecture and implementation framework will be open-sourced to facilitate the clinical translation of AI-assisted radiology solutions.

Conclusion: 通过基础设施生态系统方法（Bohrium+SciMaster）能够有效规模化智能体科学，支持组合、可审计性和基于实际使用的持续改进。

Abstract: AI agents are emerging as a practical way to run multi-step scientific workflows that interleave reasoning with tool use and verification, pointing to a shift from isolated AI-assisted steps toward \emph{agentic science at scale}. This shift is increasingly feasible, as scientific tools and models can be invoked through stable interfaces and verified with recorded execution traces, and increasingly necessary, as AI accelerates scientific output and stresses the peer-review and publication pipeline, raising the bar for traceability and credible evaluation.
  However, scaling agentic science remains difficult: workflows are hard to observe and reproduce; many tools and laboratory systems are not agent-ready; execution is hard to trace and govern; and prototype AI Scientist systems are often bespoke, limiting reuse and systematic improvement from real workflow signals.
  We argue that scaling agentic science requires an infrastructure-and-ecosystem approach, instantiated in Bohrium+SciMaster. Bohrium acts as a managed, traceable hub for AI4S assets -- akin to a HuggingFace of AI for Science -- that turns diverse scientific data, software, compute, and laboratory systems into agent-ready capabilities. SciMaster orchestrates these capabilities into long-horizon scientific workflows, on which scientific agents can be composed and executed. Between infrastructure and orchestration, a \emph{scientific intelligence substrate} organizes reusable models, knowledge, and components into executable building blocks for workflow reasoning and action, enabling composition, auditability, and improvement through use.
  We demonstrate this stack with eleven representative master agents in real workflows, achieving orders-of-magnitude reductions in end-to-end scientific cycle time and generating execution-grounded signals from real workloads at multi-million scale.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了GatorTron-Base、Llama 8B、Mistral 7B等大型语言模型与BioBERT等小型语言模型在预测重症患者休克方面的表现，发现两者性能相当，LLMs并未显著优于SLMs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在NLP领域，LLMs虽然广泛应用，但在预测任务上的研究较少。及时预测休克对改善患者预后至关重要，需要探索LLMs在此类临床预测任务中的潜力。

Method: 使用MIMIC III数据库中17,294例ICU患者数据，筛选LOS>24小时且SI>0.7的患者（正常组355例，异常组87例）。比较GatorTron-Base、Llama 8B、Mistral 7B等LLMs与BioBERT、DocBERT等SLMs。采用focal和交叉熵损失处理类别不平衡。

Result: GatorTron-Base获得最高的加权召回率（80.5%），但整体性能指标在SLMs和LLMs之间相当。LLMs在预测临床事件方面并未显示固有优势。

Conclusion: LLMs在预测未来临床事件方面并不优于SLMs。未来的LLMs训练应专注于开发能预测临床轨迹的模型，而非仅仅完成命名实体识别或表型分类等简单任务，以实现有意义的临床结果。

Abstract: With the advent of LLMs, various tasks across the natural language processing domain have been transformed. However, their application in predictive tasks remains less researched. This study compares large language models, including GatorTron-Base (trained on clinical data), Llama 8B, and Mistral 7B, against models like BioBERT, DocBERT, BioClinicalBERT, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec, setting benchmarks for predicting Shock in critically ill patients. Timely prediction of shock can enable early interventions, thus improving patient outcomes. Text data from 17,294 ICU stays of patients in the MIMIC III database were scored for length of stay > 24 hours and shock index (SI) > 0.7 to yield 355 and 87 patients with normal and abnormal SI-index, respectively. Both focal and cross-entropy losses were used during finetuning to address class imbalances. Our findings indicate that while GatorTron Base achieved the highest weighted recall of 80.5%, the overall performance metrics were comparable between SLMs and LLMs. This suggests that LLMs are not inherently superior to SLMs in predicting future clinical events despite their strong performance on text-based tasks. To achieve meaningful clinical outcomes, future efforts in training LLMs should prioritize developing models capable of predicting clinical trajectories rather than focusing on simpler tasks such as named entity recognition or phenotyping.

Abstract: Teachers' emotional states are critical in educational scenarios, profoundly impacting teaching efficacy, student engagement, and learning achievements. However, existing studies often fail to accurately capture teachers' emotions due to the performative nature and overlook the critical impact of instructional information on emotional expression.In this paper, we systematically investigate teacher sentiment analysis by building both the dataset and the model accordingly. We construct the first large-scale teacher multimodal sentiment analysis dataset, T-MED.To ensure labeling accuracy and efficiency, we employ a human-machine collaborative labeling process.The T-MED dataset includes 14,938 instances of teacher emotional data from 250 real classrooms across 11 subjects ranging from K-12 to higher education, integrating multimodal text, audio, video, and instructional information.Furthermore, we propose a novel asymmetric attention-based multimodal teacher sentiment analysis model, AAM-TSA.AAM-TSA introduces an asymmetric attention mechanism and hierarchical gating unit to enable differentiated cross-modal feature fusion and precise emotional classification. Experimental results demonstrate that AAM-TSA significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and interpretability on the T-MED dataset.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal LLMs and systems that use tools for long-video QA point to the promise of reasoning over hour-long episodes. However, many methods still compress content into lossy summaries or rely on limited toolsets, weakening temporal grounding and missing fine-grained cues. We propose a multi-agent framework in which a master LLM coordinates a grounding agent to localize question-relevant segments and a vision agent to extract targeted textual observations. The master agent plans with a step limit, and is trained with reinforcement learning to encourage concise, correct, and efficient multi-agent cooperation. This design helps the master agent focus on relevant clips via grounding, complements subtitles with visual detail, and yields interpretable trajectories. On our proposed LongTVQA and LongTVQA+ which are episode-level datasets aggregated from TVQA/TVQA+, our multi-agent system significantly outperforms strong non-agent baselines. Experiments also show reinforcement learning further strengthens reasoning and planning for the trained agent. Code and data will be shared at https://longvideoagent.github.io/.
