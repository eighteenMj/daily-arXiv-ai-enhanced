We propose two GenAI based approaches, generative conditional diffusion model (GCDM) and generative conditional diffusion implicit model (GCDIM), leveraging the diffusion model conditioned on dynamic CSI to maximize the sum spectral efficiency (SE) of the system. To benchmark performance, we compare the proposed GenAI based approaches against an expert algorithm, traditionally known for achieving near-optimal solutions at the cost of computational efficiency. The simulation results demonstrate that GCDM matches the sum SE achieved by the expert algorithm while significantly reducing the computational overhead. Furthermore, GCDIM achieves a comparable sum SE with an additional $98\\%$ reduction in computation time, underscoring its potential for efficient phase optimization in RIS-aided cell-free mMIMO systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08GCDM\u548cGCDIM\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316RIS\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u65e0\u5c0f\u533a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684RIS\u76f8\u79fb\uff0c\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u7406\u60f3\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u8c31\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728RIS\u76f8\u4f4d\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u901a\u5e38\u4ee5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e3a\u4ee3\u4ef7\u83b7\u5f97\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u5904\u7406\u5b9e\u9645\u901a\u4fe1\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08GCDM\uff09\u548c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u9690\u5f0f\u6a21\u578b\uff08GCDIM\uff09\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u8f93\u5165\u6765\u4f18\u5316RIS\u76f8\u79fb\u914d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "GCDM\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u548c\u8c31\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff1bGCDIM\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8698%\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7279\u522b\u662fGCDIM\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0RIS\u8f85\u52a9\u65e0\u5c0f\u533a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u76f8\u4f4d\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

At each FC antenna, there is one fixed-position active antenna and multiple passive couplers that can move within a designated region around the active antenna. Moreover, each FC antenna is equipped with a local processing unit (LPU). All LPUs exchange signals with a central processing unit (CPU) for joint signal processing. We study an FC-aided multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, where an FC array base station (BS) is deployed to enhance the downlink communication between the BS and multiple single-antenna users. We formulate optimization problems to maximize the achievable sum rate of users by jointly optimizing the coupler positions and digital beamforming, subject to movement constraints on the coupler positions and the transmit power constraint. To address the resulting nonconvex optimization problem, the digital beamforming is expressed as a function of the FC position vectors, which are then optimized using the proposed distributed coupler position optimization algorithm. Considering a structured time domain pattern of pilots and coupler positions, pilot-assisted centralized and distributed channel estimation algorithms are designed under the FC array architecture. Simulation results demonstrate that the distributed FC array achieves substantial rate gains over conventional benchmarks in multiuser systems without moving active antennas, and approaches the performance of fully active arrays while significantly reducing hardware cost and power consumption. Moreover, the proposed channel estimation algorithms outperform the benchmark schemes in terms of both pilot overhead and channel reconstruction accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7075\u6d3b\u8026\u5408\u5668\u9635\u5217\u4ee5\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u786c\u4ef6\u63d0\u5347\u901a\u4fe1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86FC\u8f85\u52a9\u591a\u7528\u6237MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8026\u5408\u5668\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u6210\u672c\u548c\u529f\u8017\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u4e3b\u52a8\u9635\u5217\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u786c\u4ef6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u529f\u8017\u5927\uff0c\u4e3b\u52a8\u5929\u7ebf\u96be\u4ee5\u7075\u6d3b\u79fb\u52a8\u3002\u4e3a\u5728\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u7528\u6237MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u591f\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5929\u7ebf\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7075\u6d3b\u8026\u5408\u5668\u9635\u5217\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2aFC\u5929\u7ebf\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u4e2a\u56fa\u5b9a\u4e3b\u52a8\u5929\u7ebf\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u88ab\u52a8\u8026\u5408\u5668\uff0c\u914d\u5907\u5c40\u90e8\u5904\u7406\u5355\u5143\u5e76\u4e0e\u4e2d\u592e\u5904\u7406\u5355\u5143\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86FC\u8f85\u52a9\u591a\u7528\u6237MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u8026\u5408\u5668\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7528\u6237\u548c\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5206\u5e03\u5f0fFC\u9635\u5217\u5728\u4e0d\u79fb\u52a8\u4e3b\u52a8\u5929\u7ebf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u901f\u7387\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u4e3b\u52a8\u9635\u5217\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786c\u4ef6\u6210\u672c\u548c\u529f\u8017\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5bfc\u9891\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u4fe1\u9053\u91cd\u6784\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7075\u6d3b\u8026\u5408\u5668\u9635\u5217\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6210\u672c\u548c\u529f\u8017\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u7528\u6237MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u88ab\u52a8\u8026\u5408\u5668\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u5168\u4e3b\u52a8\u9635\u5217\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Remarkably, this is the same as the capacity of the channel in the NS-assisted non-causal CSIT setting, $C^{NS,nc}=\\max_{P_{X|S}}I(X;Y\\mid S)$, which was previously established, and also matches the (either classical or with NS assistance) capacity of the channel where the state is available not only (either causally or non-causally) to the transmitter but also to the receiver. While the capacity remains unchanged, the optimal probability of error for fixed message size and blocklength, in the NS-assisted causal CSIT setting can be further improved if channel state is made available to the receiver.

The key technical ingredient is the notion of multiple equal-difference (MED) representations of the defining set of a simple-root polynomial, which generalizes the MED representation of a cyclotomic coset. We prove that every MED representation induces an upper bound on the minimum distance; the classical Singleton bound corresponds to the coarsest representation, while the strongest among these bounds is defined as the arithmetic Singleton bound. It is shown that the arithmetic Singleton bound is always at least as tight as the Singleton bound, and a precise criterion for it to be strictly tighter is obtained. For irreducible constacyclic codes, the bound is given explicitly by $\u03c9+1$, where $\u03c9$ is a constant closely related to the order of $q$ modulo the radical of the polynomial order.

However, the image quality is significantly compromised due to the limited number of Compton backscattered photons. The insufficient photon counts result primarily from photon absorption in materials, the pencil-beam scanning design, and short signal sampling times. It therefore yields severe image noise and an extremely low signal-to-noise ratio, greatly reducing the accuracy and reliability of PBI systems. To address these challenges, this paper introduces BSoNet, a novel deep learning-based approach specifically designed to optimize the image quality of PBI systems.

While existing multi-region load balancers save prefill computation by prioritizing Key--Value (KV) Cache hit rate, they ignore cluster networking latency, a critical factor in routing decisions. We introduce GORGO, a method for minimizing TTFT by optimizing a total serving cost as a function of available compute, network latency, and prefix caching. Using extensive profiling on custom infrastructure, we analyze component-level latency bottlenecks and benchmark GORGO against three baselines: (1) naive least-load routing, which ignores prefix-cache overlap; (2) prefix-similarity routing, which selectively pushes requests to the replica with the highest cached-prefix overlap; and (3) a centralized HTTP proxy that runs the GORGO policy while tracking requests across all nodes. We demonstrate that GORGO reduces P99 TTFT through network-aware routing and improves average TTFT by preventing pathological cross-region forwarding. Additionally, we find that GORGO-proxy overcomes synchronization overhead in previous methods and is 2.5x faster on median TTFT, demonstrating the success of a centralized router.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While post-training has become a pivotal technique to enhance LLMs' capabilities in this domain, its effectiveness is severely constrained by the scarcity and underutilization of high-quality training data. However, through a detailed profiling of error patterns across various problem-response pairs drawn from post-training, we identify two fundamental limitations of existing automated optimization modeling approaches: (L1) the sparsity of error-specific problems and (L2) the sparse rewards associated with difficult problems. We demonstrate that these limitations can result in suboptimal performance in domain-specific post-training for LLMs. To tackle the above two limitations, we propose a novel error-driven learning framework -- namely, auto\\textbf{m}ated opt\\textbf{i}mization modeli\\textbf{n}g via a localizable error-\\textbf{d}riven perspective (MIND) -- that customizes the whole model training framework from data synthesis to post-training.

Thus, in contrast to holistic reasoning tasks such as mathematical proofs, MIND leverages the construction of a focused, high-density training corpus and proposes \\textbf{D}ynamic Supervised \\textbf{F}ine-Tuning \\textbf{P}olicy \\textbf{O}ptimization (DFPO) to tackle difficult problems through localized refinement.

We present a human-centered XAI module in DashAI, an open-source no-code ML platform.

(Linear) minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimators provide a compelling alternative that can circumvent these limitations. In this work, we study synthetic two-dimensional blind deconvolution problems under fully controlled conditions, with complete prior knowledge of both the signal and kernel distributions. We compare tailored MAP algorithms with simple LMMSE estimators whose functional form is closely related to that of an optimal Tikhonov estimator. Our results show that, even in these highly controlled settings, MAP methods remain unstable and require extensive parameter tuning, whereas the LMMSE estimator yields a robust and reliable baseline.

Diffusion-based generative priors have recently shown promise, but typically rely on computationally intensive iterative sampling or per-instance optimization. Amortized variational inference frameworks address this inefficiency by learning a direct mapping from measurements to posteriors, enabling fast posterior sampling without requiring the optimization of a new posterior for every new set of measurements. However, they still struggle to reconstruct fine details and complex textures. To address this, we extend the amortized framework by injecting spatially adaptive perturbations to measurements during training, guided by uncertainty estimates, to emphasize learning in the most uncertain regions.

However, their enormous parameter sizes and memory demands pose major challenges for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Vector Quantization (VQ) offers a promising approach for ultra-low-bit compression in Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging a codebook, where weight vectors are mapped to the most similar discrete codewords. Yet, directly applying VQ to MoEs often leads to substantial performance degradation due to two critical obstacles: (1) redundant representations among experts cause VQ to repeatedly quantize similar representations for each expert, resulting in inefficient use of limited codebook capacity; and (2) cumulative output bias is amplified by expert aggregation in MoE layers, leading to distributional shifts in the quantized outputs. To address these issues, we propose KBVQ-MoE, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit quantization for MoE-based LLMs. KBVQ-MoE integrates two techniques: (1) input-driven redundancy elimination, where a Karhunen-Loeve Transform (KLT) guided singular value decomposition (SVD) extracts dominant weight components and shares them across experts; and (2) bias-corrected output stabilization, where vector quantization is applied only to expert-specific (non-redundant) representations and the quantized outputs are corrected via channel-wise affine compensation. Experiments on various MoE LLMs demonstrate that KBVQ-MoE preserves accuracy substantially better than existing quantization methods. For example, 3-bit quantization of Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B achieves an average accuracy of 67.99, nearly identical to the FP16 baseline of 68.07, underscoring KBVQ-MoE's potential for efficient deployment on edge devices and other resource-constrained platforms.", "AI": {"tldr": "KBVQ-MoE\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411MoE\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d85\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u4e13\u5bb6\u95f4\u5197\u4f59\u8868\u793a\u548c\u6821\u6b63\u8f93\u51fa\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u538b\u7f29\u540e\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "MoE\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5de8\u5927\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eMoE\u65f6\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u4e3a\u4e13\u5bb6\u95f4\u5197\u4f59\u8868\u793a\u6d6a\u8d39\u7801\u672c\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e13\u5bb6\u805a\u5408\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u7d2f\u79ef\u8f93\u51fa\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faKBVQ-MoE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6280\u672f\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8eKL\u53d8\u6362\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684SVD\u63d0\u53d6\u4e3b\u5bfc\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u91cf\u5e76\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u95f4\u5171\u4eab\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u8f93\u5165\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u8868\u793a\uff1b2\uff09\u4ec5\u5bf9\u4e13\u5bb6\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u8868\u793a\u8fdb\u884c\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u901a\u9053\u4eff\u5c04\u8865\u507f\u6821\u6b63\u91cf\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aMoE LLM\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cKBVQ-MoE\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\u5bf9Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B\u8fdb\u884c3\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u65f6\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523067.99\uff0c\u4e0eFP16\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0868.07\uff09\u51e0\u4e4e\u76f8\u540c\u3002", "conclusion": "KBVQ-MoE\u4e3aMoE\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u7b49\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u6781\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

Progress is hindered by fragmented data, inconsistent representations, and misaligned training objectives. We present ABot-M0, a framework that builds a systematic data curation pipeline while jointly optimizing model architecture and training strategies, enabling end-to-end transformation of heterogeneous raw data into unified, efficient representations. From six public datasets, we clean, standardize, and balance samples to construct UniACT-dataset, a large-scale dataset with over 6 million trajectories and 9,500 hours of data, covering diverse robot morphologies and task scenarios. Unified pre-training improves knowledge transfer and generalization across platforms and tasks, supporting general-purpose embodied intelligence. To improve action prediction efficiency and stability, we propose the Action Manifold Hypothesis: effective robot actions lie not in the full high-dimensional space but on a low-dimensional, smooth manifold governed by physical laws and task constraints. Based on this, we introduce Action Manifold Learning (AML), which uses a DiT backbone to predict clean, continuous action sequences directly. This shifts learning from denoising to projection onto feasible manifolds, improving decoding speed and policy stability. ABot-M0 supports modular perception via a dual-stream mechanism that integrates VLM semantics with geometric priors and multi-view inputs from plug-and-play 3D modules such as VGGT and Qwen-Image-Edit, enhancing spatial understanding without modifying the backbone and mitigating standard VLM limitations in 3D reasoning. Experiments show components operate independently with additive benefits.

Our key mechanism is an uncertainty knob that perturbs latent inputs during training and inference, teaching the solver to correct off-manifold rollout drift and stabilizing autoregressive prediction. We further use flow forcing to update a system descriptor (context) from model-generated trajectories, aligning train/test conditioning and improving long-term stability. We pretrain on a curated corpus of $\\sim$2.5M trajectories at $128^2$ resolution spanning 12 PDE families. LGS matches strong deterministic neural-operator baselines on short horizons while substantially reducing rollout drift on long horizons. Learning in latent space plus efficient architectural choices yields up to \\textbf{70$\\times$} lower FLOPs than non-generative baselines, enabling scalable pretraining. We also show efficient adaptation to an out-of-distribution $256^2$ Kolmogorov flow dataset under limited finetuning budgets.

Closed-form CRB expressions are derived for two representative detection formulations, namely covariance-oriented and coherent models. Moreover, for single-antenna FASs, we obtain a closed-form coherent CRB by leveraging random matrix theory.

Cine 2D MRI slices were then acquired in 30 subjects (19 volunteers, 11 aortic stenosis patients). After manual segmentation, time-resolved aortic models were generated via differentiable volumetric mesh optimization to derive vessel shape features, centerline parameters, and radial wall strain. In 10 subjects, additional 4D flow MRI was acquired to compare peak-systolic shapes.\n  Results: Anatomically accurate aortic geometries were obtained from as few as six cine 2D MRI slices, achieving a mean +/- standard deviation Dice score of (89.9 +/- 1.6) %, Intersection over Union of (81.7 +/- 2.7) %, Hausdorff distance of (7.3 +/- 3.3) mm, and Chamfer distance of (3.7 +/- 0.6) mm relative to 4D flow MRI.

We introduce the chemo-hydrodynamic transceiver, a unified model for catalytic Janus particles in which an external optical control simultaneously drives molecular emission and active self-propulsion. Unlike common abstractions that decouple mobility and communication, we derive a stochastic channel model that captures their physicochemical coupling and shows that actuation-induced distance jitter can dominate the received-signal variance, yielding a fundamental trade-off: stronger actuation increases emission but can sharply reduce reliability through motion-induced fading. Numerical results reveal a unimodal reliability profile with a critical actuation level beyond which the signal-to-noise ratio collapses, and an optimal control level that scales approximately linearly with link distance. Compared with Brownian-mobility baselines, the model exposes a pronounced estimation gap: neglecting active motility noise can underestimate the bit error probability by orders of magnitude.

We show that this spike tail separation persists throughout training, with the spike occupying only about 1.5% of directions yet dominating optimizer statistics. This dominance suppresses tail learning by contracting tail updates through second moment normalization and tightening the globally stable learning rate bound. Motivated by this analysis, we propose Spectra, a spike aware optimizer that suppresses the dominant low rank spike subspace without amplifying the noise sensitive spectral tail.

So, tea cultivation plays an important role to boost the economy. These valuable plants are vulnerable to various kinds of leaf infections which may cause less production and low quality. It is not so easy to detect these diseases manually. It may take time and there could be some errors in the detection.Therefore, the purpose of the study is to develop an automated deep learning model for tea leaf disease classification based on the teaLeafBD dataset so that anyone can detect the diseases more easily and efficiently. There are 5,278 high-resolution images in this dataset. The images are classified into seven categories. Six of them represents various diseases and the rest one represents healthy leaves. The proposed pipeline contains data preprocessing, data splitting, adversarial training, augmentation, model training, evaluation, and comprehension made possible with Explainable AI strategies. DenseNet201 and EfficientNetB3 were employed to perform the classification task. To prepare the model more robustly, we applied adversarial training so it can operate effectively even with noisy or disturbed inputs. In addition, Grad-CAM visualization was executed to analyze the model's predictions by identifying the most influential regions of each image. Our experimental outcomes revealed that EfficientNetB3 achieved the highest classification accuracy of 93%, while DenseNet201 reached 91%.

It is typically quantified using the Age of Information (AoI) metric, which has been widely adopted to capture the freshness of information received in the form of status updates. While AoI-based metrics quantify how timely the collected information is, they largely overlook the environmental impact associated with frequent transmissions, specifically, the resulting Carbon Footprint (CF). To address this gap, we introduce a carbon-aware AoI framework. We first derive closed-form expressions for the average AoI under constrained CF budgets for the baseline $M/M/1$ and $M/M/1^*$ queuing models, assuming fixed Carbon Intensity (CI). We then extend the analysis by treating CI as a dynamic, time-varying parameter and solve the AoI minimization problem. Our results show that minimizing AoI does not inherently minimize CF, highlighting a clear trade-off between information freshness and environmental impact. CI variability further affects achievable AoI, indicating that sustainable operation requires joint optimization of CF budgets, Signal-to-noise Ratio (SNR), and transmission scheduling. This work lays the foundation for carbon-aware information freshness optimization in next-generation networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Gossiping enables local information exchange in a decentralized manner without relying solely on the transmitter's direct communication, which we assume incurs a transmission cost. On the other hand, gossiping may be communicating stale information, necessitating the transmitter's intervention. With communication links having specific success probabilities, we formulate an average-cost Markov Decision Process (MDP) to jointly minimize the sum AoI and transmission cost for such a system in a time-slotted setting. We employ the Relative Value Iteration (RVI) algorithm to evaluate the optimal policy for the transmitter and then prove several structural properties showing that it has an age-difference threshold structure with minimum age activation in the case where gossiping is relatively more reliable. Specifically, direct transmission is optimal only if the minimum AoI of the receivers is large enough and their age difference is below a certain threshold. Otherwise, the transmitter idles to effectively take advantage of gossiping and reduce direct transmission costs. Numerical evaluations demonstrate the significance of our optimal policy compared to multiple baselines. Our result is a first step towards characterizing optimal freshness and transmission cost trade-offs in gossiping networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Due to the inherent difference in short-circuit capacity contributions of synchronous generators and inverters, the short-circuit ratio is not a one-size-fit-all metric to assess the system strength. Following the distinct dynamic behavior of the IBR in small- and large-signal disturbance, the system strength is separated accordingly. To address the large-signal system strength assessment, a control type-dependent metric, Power Margin Ratio (PMR), is proposed in this paper. PMR is defined as the ratio between the maximum power that can be injected to the system without causing any instability and the nominal power of the IBR. It can be obtained via power flow calculation with a modified algorithm. The theoretical foundation of PMR is established from the viewpoint of dynamical systems. PMR is identical to SCR for the single-plant-infinite-bus system, while presents advancement for multi-infeed power systems.

However, existing self-play methods for vision-language models rely on passive interaction with static image collections, resulting in strong dependence on initial datasets and inefficient learning. Without the ability to actively seek visual data tailored to their evolving capabilities, agents waste computational effort on samples that are either trivial or beyond their current skill level. To address these limitations, we propose Active-Zero, a framework that shifts from passive interaction to active exploration of visual environments. Active-Zero employs three co-evolving agents: a Searcher that retrieves images from open-world repositories based on the model's capability frontier, a Questioner that synthesizes calibrated reasoning tasks, and a Solver refined through accuracy rewards. This closed loop enables self-scaffolding auto-curricula where the model autonomously constructs its learning trajectory. On Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct across 12 benchmarks, Active-Zero achieves 53.97 average accuracy on reasoning tasks (5.7% improvement) and 59.77 on general understanding (3.9% improvement), consistently outperforming existing self-play baselines.

To mitigate errors caused by sampling randomness, we derive transition probabilities and log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) for each constellation point and employ practical channel codes for error correction.

However, to date, limited attention has been paid to transferring NR-PCQA models across domains. To address this challenge, we propose the first unsupervised progressive domain adaptation (UPDA) framework for NR-PCQA, which introduces a two-stage coarse-to-fine alignment paradigm to address domain shifts. At the coarse-grained stage, a discrepancy-aware coarse-grained alignment method is designed to capture relative quality relationships between cross-domain samples through a novel quality-discrepancy-aware hybrid loss, circumventing the challenges of direct absolute feature alignment. At the fine-grained stage, a perception fusion fine-grained alignment approach with symmetric feature fusion is developed to identify domain-invariant features, while a conditional discriminator selectively enhances the transfer of quality-relevant features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed UPDA effectively enhances the performance of NR-PCQA methods in cross-domain scenarios, validating its practical applicability.

Existing placement methods typically focus on minimizing wirelength or transforming multi-objective optimization into a single objective through weighted sum, which limits their ability to handle competing design requirements. Wirelength reduction and thermal management are inherently conflicting objectives, making prior approaches inadequate for practical deployment. To address this challenge, we propose TDPNavigator-Placer, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that dynamically optimizes placement based on chiplet's thermal design power (TDP). This approach explicitly assigns these inherently conflicting objectives to specialized agents, each operating under distinct reward mechanisms and environmental constraints within a unified placement paradigm.

PBSAI organizes responsibilities into a twelve domain taxonomy and defines bounded agent families that mediate between tools and policy through shared context envelopes and structured output contracts. The architecture assumes baseline enterprise security capabilities and encodes key systems security techniques, including analytic monitoring, coordinated defense, and adaptive response. A lightweight formal model of agents, context envelopes, and ecosystem level invariants clarifies the traceability, provenance, and human in the loop guarantees enforced across domains.

However, driven by cost minimization, OPF provides an ideal, albeit unrealistic, clearing of the generating units, disregarding the complex interactions among market participants. The security of the system, therefore, may be overestimated. To address this gap, we introduce a market model with a social-welfare-based day-ahead market clearing mechanism. The security implications are analyzed via Cascades, a cascading outage analysis framework. We apply this framework to the IEEE-118 bus system with three independent control zones. The results show that market dispatch leads to an increase in demand not served of up to 80% higher than OPF, highlighting a security overestimation.

We test leading open- and closed-source VidLMs and find that these models confidently describe reversed scenes as forward, answer questions while neglecting video content, agree with false claims, struggle with basic camera motion, and fail to aggregate temporal information amidst simple spatiotemporal masking. Humans, on the other hand, succeed at these tasks with ease. Alongside our benchmark, we provide a data pipeline that automatically generates diagnostic examples for our stress tests, enabling broader and more scalable evaluation.

However, the foundational \"ground truth\" paradigm rests on a positivistic fallacy that treats human disagreement as technical noise rather than a vital sociotechnical signal. This systematic literature review analyzes research published between 2020 and 2025 across seven premier venues: ACL, AIES, CHI, CSCW, EAAMO, FAccT, and NeurIPS, investigating the mechanisms in data annotation practices that facilitate this \"consensus trap\". Our identification phase captured 30,897 records, which were refined via a tiered keyword filtration schema to a high-recall corpus of 3,042 records for manual screening, resulting in a final included corpus of 346 papers for qualitative synthesis. Our reflexive thematic analysis reveals that systemic failures in positional legibility, combined with the recent architectural shift toward human-as-verifier models, specifically the reliance on model-mediated annotations, introduce deep-seated anchoring bias and effectively remove human voices from the loop. We further demonstrate how geographic hegemony imposes Western norms as universal benchmarks, often enforced by the performative alignment of precarious data workers who prioritize requester compliance over honest subjectivity to avoid economic penalties. Critiquing the \"noisy sensor\" fallacy, where statistical models misdiagnose cultural pluralism as random error, we argue for reclaiming disagreement as a high-fidelity signal essential for building culturally competent models. To address these systemic tensions, we propose a roadmap for pluralistic annotation infrastructures that shift the objective from discovering a singular \"right\" answer to mapping the diversity of human experience.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This condition accommodates a broad range of nonlinear models in control and machine learning such as saturation functions, sigmoid, ReLU and tanh activation functions, and standard classification models. Without requiring any persistent excitation of the data, we establish global convergence of the proposed adaptive predictor and derive explicit rates for its asymptotic performance.

However, their large overall parameter counts and model sizes have precluded their widespread usage in resource-constrained settings as all of the parameters must still be loaded into GPU memory. Prior works aim to address this memory bottleneck by offloading certain experts into CPU memory and porting them to GPU memory only when they are activated. In practice, these methods suffer from the significant I/O latency incurred by expert transfer. We present MELINOE, a method that fine-tunes an MoE model to more strongly prefer activating a smaller number of experts per sequence. Caching these preferred experts in GPU memory reduces expert churn and CPU-GPU transfer overhead. MELINOE increases throughput by $1.2-3\\times$ over efficient baselines and up to $14.7\\times$ over transfer-heavy baselines while retaining or even improving the performance of the model on a downstream task, making it a reliable method for improving MoE inference efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "MELINOE\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03MoE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u66f4\u504f\u597d\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5c11\u6570\u4e13\u5bb6\u5e76\u7f13\u5b58\u5230GPU\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e13\u5bb6\u5207\u6362\u548cCPU-GPU\u4f20\u8f93\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387", "motivation": "MoE\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6240\u6709\u53c2\u6570\u4ecd\u9700\u52a0\u8f7d\u5230GPU\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4f7f\u7528\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u90e8\u5206\u4e13\u5bb6\u5378\u8f7d\u5230CPU\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e13\u5bb6\u4f20\u8f93\u65f6\u4ea7\u751f\u663e\u8457\u7684I/O\u5ef6\u8fdf", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03MoE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u66f4\u52a0\u5f3a\u70c8\u5730\u504f\u597d\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u6fc0\u6d3b\u8f83\u5c11\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u597d\u7684\u4e13\u5bb6\u7f13\u5b58\u5728GPU\u5185\u5b58\u4e2d", "result": "MELINOE\u5c06\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u53471.2-3\u500d\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9ad8\u6548\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u6700\u591a\u63d0\u534714.7\u500d\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f20\u8f93\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "MELINOE\u662f\u63d0\u9ad8MoE\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u4e13\u5bb6\u66f4\u6362\u548c\u4f20\u8f93\u5f00\u9500\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd"}}

Here, we present and test a novel pipeline for generating synthetic images from high-quality 3D models and programmatically generated camera poses.

Despite their success, aligning LLM-based evaluations with human judgments remains challenging. While supervised fine-tuning on human-labeled data can improve alignment, it is costly and inflexible, requiring new training for each task or dataset. Recent progress in auto prompt optimization (APO) offers a more efficient alternative by automatically improving the instructions that guide LLM judges. However, existing APO methods primarily target text-only evaluations and remain underexplored in multimodal settings. In this work, we study auto prompt optimization for multimodal LLM-as-a-judge, particularly for evaluating AI-generated images. We identify a key bottleneck: multimodal models can only process a limited number of visual examples due to context window constraints, which hinders effective trial-and-error prompt refinement. To overcome this, we propose BLPO, a bi-level prompt optimization framework that converts images into textual representations while preserving evaluation-relevant visual cues.

Upon burning, soil on the surface or immediately beneath becomes hydrophobic, a phenomenon that occurs predominantly on sand-based hillslopes. Rainwater and eroded soil blanket the downslope, leading to catastrophic debris flows. Soil hydrophobicity enhances erosion, resulting in post-wildfire debris flows that differ from natural mudflows in intensity, duration, and destructiveness. Thus, it is crucial to understand the timing and conditions of debris-flow onset, driven by the coupled effects of critical parameters: varying rain intensities (RI), slope gradients, water-entry values, and grain sizes (D50). Machine Learning (ML) techniques have become increasingly valuable in geotechnical engineering due to their ability to model complex systems without predefined assumptions. This study applies multiple ML algorithms: multiple linear regression (MLR), logistic regression (LR), support vector classifier (SVC), K-means clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) to predict and classify outcomes from laboratory experiments that model field conditions using a rain device on various soils in sloped flumes. While MLR effectively predicted total discharge, erosion predictions were less accurate, especially for coarse sand. LR and SVC achieved good accuracy in classifying failure outcomes, supported by clustering and dimensionality reduction. Sensitivity analysis revealed that fine sand is highly susceptible to erosion, particularly under low-intensity, long-duration rainfall. Results also show that the first 10 minutes of high-intensity rain are most critical for discharge and failure. These findings highlight the potential of ML for post-wildfire hazard assessment and emergency response planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper focuses on selective prediction, which allows DNNs to make informed decisions about when to predict or abstain based on the uncertainty level of their predictions. Current methods are either ad-hoc such as SelectiveNet, focusing on how to modify the network architecture or objective function, or post-hoc such as softmax response, achieving selective prediction through analyzing the model's probabilistic outputs. We observe that post-hoc methods implicitly generate uncertainty information, termed the selective prior, which has traditionally been used only during inference. We argue that the selective prior provided by the selection mechanism is equally vital during the training stage. Therefore, we propose the SYNC loss which introduces a novel integration of ad-hoc and post-hoc method. Specifically, our approach incorporates the softmax response into the training process of SelectiveNet, enhancing its selective prediction capabilities by examining the selective prior. Evaluated across various datasets, including CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Stanford Cars, our method not only enhances the model's generalization capabilities but also surpasses previous works in selective prediction performance, and sets new benchmarks for state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, their performance in real-world deployments often that observed on benchmark settings, especially in complex and imperfect environments. This discrepancy largely arises because prevailing training and evaluation paradigms are typically built on idealized assumptions, overlooking the inherent stochasticity and noise present in real-world interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentNoiseBench, a framework for systematically evaluating the robustness of agentic models under noisy environments. We first conduct an in-depth analysis of biases and uncertainties in real-world scenarios and categorize environmental noise into two primary types: user-noise and tool-noise. Building on this analysis, we develop an automated pipeline that injects controllable noise into existing agent-centric benchmarks while preserving task solvability. Leveraging this pipeline, we perform extensive evaluations across a wide range of models with diverse architectures and parameter scales. Our results reveal consistent performance variations under different noise conditions, highlighting the sensitivity of current agentic models to realistic environmental perturbations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, these specifications do not clearly define the location of the internal voltage source, and no systematic method exists to quantify its effective impedance for a black-box GFM model. To address this, we first compare the transient responses of an ideal voltage source and a GFM to show that an idealistic GFM maintains a (nearly) constant voltage across the filter capacitor, rather than at the inverter switches. Then we propose a systematic method to quantify the effective impedance of a GFM from its black-box model using frequency-domain admittance plots.

Our work bridges this gap by integrating learned depth priors directly into the VINS-Mono optimization backend. We propose a novel framework that enforces affine-invariant depth consistency and pairwise ordinal constraints, explicitly filtering unstable artifacts via variance-based gating. This approach strictly adheres to the computational limits of edge devices while robustly recovering metric scale.

However, existing pipelines face a critical challenge in balancing task performance with user engagement, as passive agents can not efficiently adapt to users' intentions while overuse of human feedback reduces their satisfaction. To address this trade-off, we propose BAO, an agentic RL framework that combines behavior enhancement to enrich proactive reasoning and information-gathering capabilities with behavior regularization to suppress inefficient or redundant interactions and align agent behavior with user expectations. We evaluate BAO on multiple tasks from the UserRL benchmark suite, and demonstrate that it substantially outperforms proactive agentic RL baselines while achieving comparable or even superior performance to commercial LLM agents, highlighting its effectiveness for training proactive, user-aligned LLM agents in complex multi-turn scenarios.

While several defense methods have been explored recently, they rely primarily on task-specific adversarial fine-tuning, which inevitably limits generalizability and causes catastrophic forgetting and deteriorates benign performance. Different with previous works, we propose a more rigorous defense goal that requires only a single tuning for diverse downstream tasks to defend against DAEs and preserve benign performance. To achieve this defense goal, we introduce Zero-Sacrifice Persistent-Robustness Adversarial Defense (ZePAD), which is inspired by the inherent sensitivity of neural networks to data characteristics. Specifically, ZePAD is a dual-branch structure, which consists of a Multi-Pattern Adversarial Enhancement Branch (MPAE-Branch) that uses two adversarially fine-tuned encoders to strengthen adversarial resistance. The Benign Memory Preservation Branch (BMP-Branch) is trained on local data to ensure adversarial robustness does not compromise benign performance. Surprisingly, we find that ZePAD can directly detect DAEs by evaluating branch confidence, without introducing any adversarial exsample identification task during training. Notably, by enriching feature diversity, our method enables a single adversarial fine-tuning to defend against DAEs across downstream tasks, thereby achieving persistent robustness. Extensive experiments on 11 SSL methods and 6 datasets validate its effectiveness. In certain cases, it achieves a 29.20% improvement in benign performance and a 73.86% gain in adversarial robustness, highlighting its zero-sacrifice property.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Furthermore, most benchmarks only evaluate outcomes rather than the replication process. In response, we introduce ReplicatorBench, an end-to-end benchmark, including human-verified replicable and non-replicable research claims in social and behavioral sciences for evaluating AI agents in research replication across three stages: (1) extraction and retrieval of replication data; (2) design and execution of computational experiments; and (3) interpretation of results, allowing a test of AI agents' capability to mimic the activities of human replicators in real world. To set a baseline of AI agents' capability, we develop ReplicatorAgent, an agentic framework equipped with necessary tools, like web search and iterative interaction with sandboxed environments, to accomplish tasks in ReplicatorBench. We evaluate ReplicatorAgent across four underlying large language models (LLMs), as well as different design choices of programming language and levels of code access.

We separate the hypothesis into two claims: linear representation (features are linearly embedded in neuron activations) and linear accessibility (features can be linearly decoded). We then ask: How many neurons $d$ suffice to both linearly represent and linearly access $m$ features? Classical results in compressed sensing imply that for $k$-sparse inputs, $d = O(k\\log (m/k))$ suffices if we allow non-linear decoding algorithms (Candes and Tao, 2006; Candes et al., 2006; Donoho, 2006). However, the additional requirement of linear decoding takes the problem out of the classical compressed sensing, into linear compressed sensing.\n  Our main theoretical result establishes nearly-matching upper and lower bounds for linear compressed sensing. We prove that $d = \u03a9_\u03b5(\\frac{k^2}{\\log k}\\log (m/k))$ is required while $d = O_\u03b5(k^2\\log m)$ suffices. The lower bound establishes a quantitative gap between classical and linear compressed setting, illustrating how linear accessibility is a meaningfully stronger hypothesis than linear representation alone. The upper bound confirms that neurons can store an exponential number of features under the LRH, giving theoretical evidence for the \"superposition hypothesis\" (Elhage et al., 2022).\n  The upper bound proof uses standard random constructions of matrices with approximately orthogonal columns. The lower bound proof uses rank bounds for near-identity matrices (Alon, 2003) together with Tur\u00e1n's theorem (bounding the number of edges in clique-free graphs).

Traditional compression techniques, such as dictionary-based and statistical methods, often struggle to optimally exploit the structure and redundancy in complex data formats. Recent advancements in deep learning have opened new avenues for compression; however, many existing approaches depend on dense vector representations that obscure the underlying token structure. To address these limitations, we propose a novel lossless compression method that leverages Reinforcement Learning applied to a T5 language model architecture. This approach enables the compression of data into sequences of tokens rather than traditional vector representations. Unlike auto-encoders, which typically encode information into continuous latent spaces, our method preserves the token-based structure, aligning more closely with the original data format. This preservation allows for higher compression ratios while maintaining semantic integrity. By training the model using an off-policy Reinforcement Learning algorithm, we optimize sequence length to minimize redundancy and enhance compression efficiency. Our method introduces an efficient and adaptive data compression system built upon advanced Reinforcement Learning techniques, functioning independently of external grammatical or world knowledge. This approach shows significant improvements in compression ratios compared to conventional methods. By leveraging the latent information within language models, our system effectively compresses data without requiring explicit content understanding, paving the way for more robust and practical compression solutions across various applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

They discard information during image encoding, require a separately trained decoder, and model an auxiliary distribution to the raw data. In this paper, we propose Latent Forcing, a simple modification to existing architectures that achieves the efficiency of latent diffusion while operating on raw natural images. Our approach orders the denoising trajectory by jointly processing latents and pixels with separately tuned noise schedules. This allows the latents to act as a scratchpad for intermediate computation before high-frequency pixel features are generated. We find that the order of conditioning signals is critical, and we analyze this to explain differences between REPA distillation in the tokenizer and the diffusion model, conditional versus unconditional generation, and how tokenizer reconstruction quality relates to diffusability. Applied to ImageNet, Latent Forcing achieves a new state-of-the-art for diffusion transformer-based pixel generation at our compute scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recent approaches introduce recurrent memory to extend context beyond the current window, yet these often face a fundamental trade-off between theoretical principles and practical scalability. To address this, we introduce Elastic Memory, a novel memory architecture grounded in the HiPPO framework for online function approximation. Elastic Memory treats historical sequence as samples from continuous signals, applying optimal online compression to encode them into a fixed-size memory state. For retrieval, we propose a flexible \\textit{polynomial sampling} mechanism that reconstructs a history summary from this compressed state. Elastic Memory consistently outperformed baselines on long-context (32k+) datasets across three domains. With equal parameters, it beat Memorizing Transformer by 16x memory and outperformed Melodi at all memory sizes, even when Melodi had 30% more parameters. When scaling model size, Elastic Memory stayed ahead of all baselines and was significantly faster than Melodi at 4x size. Furthermore, its decoupled design allows for injecting inductive biases at test-time to boost performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Geometry-based approaches offer precise control but require explicit 3D reconstruction and generalize poorly; diffusion-based methods generalize better but lack fine-grained geometric control. We present Ctrl&Shift, an end-to-end diffusion framework to achieve geometry-consistent object manipulation without explicit 3D representations. Our key insight is to decompose manipulation into two stages, object removal and reference-guided inpainting under explicit camera pose control, and encode both within a unified diffusion process. To enable precise, disentangled control, we design a multi-task, multi-stage training strategy that separates background, identity, and pose signals across tasks. To improve generalization, we introduce a scalable real-world dataset construction pipeline that generates paired image and video samples with estimated relative camera poses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Ctrl&Shift achieves state-of-the-art results in fidelity, viewpoint consistency, and controllability.

However, the reliability of this recipe in real-world settings remains unreliable due to environmental uncertainties arising from the sim-to-real gap, model mismatch, and system noise. We address this gap by introducing Distributionally robust IGM (DrIGM), a principle that requires each agent's robust greedy action to align with the robust team-optimal joint action. We show that DrIGM holds for a novel definition of robust individual action values, which is compatible with decentralized greedy execution and yields a provable robustness guarantee for the whole system. Building on this foundation, we derive DrIGM-compliant robust variants of existing value-factorization architectures (e.g., VDN/QMIX/QTRAN) that (i) train on robust Q-targets, (ii) preserve scalability, and (iii) integrate seamlessly with existing codebases without bespoke per-agent reward shaping.

Generative molecular dynamics (GenMD) has recently emerged as an alternative, learning surrogates of molecular distributions either from data or through interaction with energy models. While these methods enable efficient sampling, their transferability across molecular systems is often limited. In this work, we show that incorporating auxiliary sources of information can improve the data efficiency and generalization of transferable implicit transfer operators (TITO) for molecular dynamics. We find that coarse-grained TITO models are substantially more data-efficient than Boltzmann Emulators, and that incorporating protein language model (pLM) embeddings further improves out-of-distribution generalization. Our approach, PLaTITO, achieves state-of-the-art performance on equilibrium sampling benchmarks for out-of-distribution protein systems, including fast-folding proteins.

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), a sequence tailored to detect and reconstruct white matter tracts within the brain, is particularly prone to such imaging degradation due to inherent sequence design coupled with prolonged scan times. In addition, ULF DTI scans exhibit artifacting that spans both the space and angular domains, requiring a custom modelling algorithm for subsequent correction. We introduce a nine-direction, single-shell ULF DTI sequence, as well as a companion Bayesian bias field correction algorithm that possesses angular dependence and convolutional neural network-based superresolution algorithm that is generalizable across DTI datasets and does not require re-training (''DiffSR''). We show through a synthetic downsampling experiment and white matter assessment in real, matched ULF and high-field DTI scans that these algorithms can recover microstructural and volumetric white matter information at ULF. We also show that DiffSR can be directly applied to white matter-based Alzheimers disease classification in synthetically degraded scans, with notable improvements in agreement between DTI metrics, as compared to un-degraded scans. We freely disseminate the Bayesian bias correction algorithm and DiffSR with the goal of furthering progress on both ULF reconstruction methods and general DTI sequence harmonization.

We explore multimodal RLVR through the lens of cross-modal attention connectivity and find that only a small fraction of tokens (approximately 15%) exhibit strong visual-textual coupling. These high-connectivity tokens act as anchors that ground reasoning in the image, while the majority follow linguistic patterns. During RLVR training, credit assignment naturally concentrates on these anchors, sharpening their visual grounding over time. Building on this insight, we propose Anchor-Token Reinforcement Learning (AT-RL), a lightweight framework that selectively reinforces high-connectivity tokens via graph-based clustering of attention topology. Evaluated across the series (3B-32B), AT-RL introduces only 1.2% overhead yet enables the 32B model to surpass the 72B-Instruct baseline on MathVista (80.2), with consistent gains observed across STEM, video and general tasks. Conversely, training solely on low-connectivity tokens causes severe degradation, confirming that effective multimodal RL hinges on precise credit assignment to visual anchors. Our work reveals that reasoning quality is governed not by token quantity but by the fidelity of cross-modal anchoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Which benchmarks serve as robust cross-stage predictors and which are unreliable? RQ3. How do transfer dynamics shift with model scale? RQ4. How well does model confidence align with accuracy, as a measure of calibration quality? Does this alignment pattern transfer across training stages? We address these questions through a suite of correlation protocols applied to accuracy and confidence metrics across diverse data mixtures and model scales.

When agents coordinate on tasks, sensitive data passes through inter-agent messages, shared memory, and tool arguments; pathways that output-only audits never inspect. We introduce AgentLeak, to the best of our knowledge the first full-stack benchmark for privacy leakage covering internal channels, spanning 1,000 scenarios across healthcare, finance, legal, and corporate domains, paired with a 32-class attack taxonomy and three-tier detection pipeline. Testing GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Mistral Large, and Llama 3.3 70B across 4,979 traces reveals that multi-agent configurations reduce per-channel output leakage (C1: 27.2% vs 43.2% in single-agent) but introduce unmonitored internal channels that raise total system exposure to 68.9% (OR-aggregated across C1, C2, C5). Internal channels account for most of this gap: inter-agent messages (C2) leak at 68.8%, compared to 27.2% on C1 (output channel). This means that output-only audits miss 41.7% of violations. Claude 3.5 Sonnet, which emphasizes safety alignment in its design, achieves the lowest leakage rates on both external (3.3%) and internal (28.1%) channels, suggesting that model-level safety training may transfer to internal channel protection. Across all five models and four domains, the pattern C2 > C1 holds consistently, confirming that inter-agent communication is the primary vulnerability.

Recent empirical and theoretical results show these estimates are typically strongly correlated, so changes in predictive spread simultaneously affect both components and blur their semantics. We propose a credal-set formulation in which uncertainty is represented as a set of predictive distributions, so that epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty correspond to distinct geometric properties: the size of the set versus the noise within its elements. We instantiate this idea in a Variational Credal Concept Bottleneck Model with two disjoint uncertainty heads trained by disjoint objectives and non-overlapping gradient paths, yielding separation by construction rather than post hoc decomposition. Across multi-annotator benchmarks, our approach reduces the correlation between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty by over an order of magnitude compared to standard methods, while improving the alignment of epistemic uncertainty with prediction error and aleatoric uncertainty with ground-truth ambiguity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u5ff5\u96c6\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u96c6\uff0c\u5c06\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5076\u7136\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e3a\u96c6\u5408\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u566a\u58f0\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e24\u8005\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5076\u7136\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u53ef\u9760\u51b3\u7b56\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4ece\u540c\u4e00\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e24\u8005\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f30\u8ba1\u7ed3\u679c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u6a21\u7cca\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53d8\u5206\u4fe1\u5ff5\u6982\u5ff5\u74f6\u9888\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u76f8\u4ea4\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5934\u90e8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u975e\u91cd\u53e0\u68af\u5ea6\u8def\u5f84\u6784\u5efa\u5f0f\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u5c06\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e3a\u4fe1\u5ff5\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u5076\u7136\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e3a\u5143\u7d20\u5185\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6807\u6ce8\u8005\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u5076\u7136\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u9884\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u5076\u7136\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6b67\u4e49\u6027\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4fe1\u5ff5\u96c6\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u539f\u5219\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5f0f\u5206\u79bb\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8ba4\u77e5\u548c\u5076\u7136\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u771f\u6b63\u72ec\u7acb\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5bf9\u53ef\u9760\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

While existing methods typically rely on dedicated models for achieving specific compression ratios, they are often limited in flexibility and generalization. In particular, retraining is necessary when adapting to a new compression ratio. To address this limitation, we propose a novel and flexible Arbitrary Ratio Feature Compression (ARFC) framework, which supports any compression ratio with a single model, eliminating the need for multiple specialized models. At its core, the Arbitrary Ratio Compressor (ARC) is an auto-regressive model that performs compression via next-token prediction. This allows the compression ratio to be controlled at inference simply by adjusting the number of generated tokens. To enhance the quality of the compressed features, two key modules are introduced. The Mixture of Solutions (MoS) module refines the compressed tokens by utilizing multiple compression results (solutions), reducing uncertainty and improving robustness. The Entity Relation Graph Constraint (ERGC) is integrated into the training process to preserve semantic and structural relationships during compression. Extensive experiments on cross-modal retrieval, image classification, and image retrieval tasks across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches at various compression ratios. Notably, in some cases, it even surpasses the performance of the original, uncompressed features. These results validate the effectiveness and versatility of ARFC for practical, resource-constrained scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, most existing approaches primarily emphasize learning task-specific outputs or static knowledge representations, while overlooking the continuous refinement of internal reasoning structures, action scheduling policies, and learning mechanisms themselves. In this paper, we propose a human-inspired continuous learning framework that unifies reasoning, action, reflection, and verification within a sequential reasoning model enhanced by parallel learning. The framework explicitly treats internal thinking processes as primary learning objects. It systematically records internal reasoning trajectories and environmental interactions as structured learning material, enabling the system to optimize not only task-level content but also the organization, scheduling, and evolution of reasoning activities. This design realizes learning alongside processing, allowing cognitive structures to improve during execution. Furthermore, the framework supports controlled replacement of predefined logic with learned procedures and introduces a hierarchical learning-to-learn mechanism that jointly adapts task-level parameters and learning strategies. As a result, the system progressively evolves its internal cognitive architecture while preserving operational stability.

When downstream data exhibit a substantial distribution shift from the model's prior training distribution, SFT can induce catastrophic forgetting. To narrow this gap, data rewriting has been proposed as a data-centric approach that rewrites downstream training data prior to SFT. However, existing methods typically sample rewrites from a prompt-induced conditional distribution, so the resulting targets are not necessarily aligned with the model's natural QA-style generation distribution. Moreover, reliance on fixed templates can lead to diversity collapse. To address these issues, we cast data rewriting as a policy learning problem and learn a rewriting policy that better matches the backbone's QA-style generation distribution while preserving diversity. Since distributional alignment, diversity and task consistency are automatically evaluable but difficult to optimize end-to-end with differentiable objectives, we leverage reinforcement learning to optimize the rewrite distribution under reward feedback and propose an RL-based data-rewriting agent. The agent jointly optimizes QA-style distributional alignment and diversity under a hard task-consistency gate, thereby constructing a higher-quality rewritten dataset for downstream SFT. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves downstream gains comparable to standard SFT while reducing forgetting on non-downstream benchmarks by 12.34% on average.

Moreover, inconsistent MRI acquisition protocols across institutions hinder generalizability of models. Conventional transformer and DL pipelines often fail to capture the multi-scale morphological diversity such as fragmented necrotic cores, infiltrating margins, and disjoint enhancing components leading to scanner-specific artifacts and poor cross-site prognosis. We propose TopoGBM, a learning framework designed to capture heterogeneity-preserved, scanner-robust representations from multi-parametric 3D MRI. Central to our approach is a 3D convolutional autoencoder regularized by a topological regularization that preserves the complex, non-Euclidean invariants of the tumor's manifold within a compressed latent space. By enforcing these topological priors, TopoGBM explicitly models the high-variance structural signatures characteristic of aggressive GBM. Evaluated across heterogeneous cohorts (UPENN, UCSF, RHUH) and external validation on TCGA, TopoGBM achieves better performance (C-index 0.67 test, 0.58 validation), outperforming baselines that degrade under domain shift. Mechanistic interpretability analysis reveals that reconstruction residuals are highly localized to pathologically heterogeneous zones, with tumor-restricted and healthy tissue error significantly low (Test: 0.03, Validation: 0.09). Furthermore, occlusion-based attribution localizes approximately 50% of the prognostic signal to the tumor and the diverse peritumoral microenvironment advocating clinical reliability of the unsupervised learning method.

Journal version of VasoMIM (AAAI 2026)", "summary": "X-ray angiography is the gold standard imaging modality for cardiovascular diseases. However, current deep learning approaches for X-ray angiogram analysis are severely constrained by the scarcity of annotated data. While large-scale self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising solution, its potential in this domain remains largely unexplored, primarily due to the lack of effective SSL frameworks and large-scale datasets. To bridge this gap, we introduce a vascular anatomy-aware masked image modeling (VasoMIM) framework that explicitly integrates domain-specific anatomical knowledge. Specifically, VasoMIM comprises two key designs: an anatomy-guided masking strategy and an anatomical consistency loss. The former strategically masks vessel-containing patches to compel the model to learn robust vascular semantics, while the latter preserves structural consistency of vessels between original and reconstructed images, enhancing the discriminability of the learned representations. In conjunction with VasoMIM, we curate XA-170K, the largest X-ray angiogram pre-training dataset to date.

Clinical decision support systems incorporating artificial intelligence (AI-CDSS) can assist medical professionals in diagnosing type 2 diabetes with high accuracy. This study aimed to assess an AI-CDSS specifically developed for the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes by employing a hybrid approach that integrates expert-driven insights with machine learning techniques. The AI-CDSS was developed (training dataset: n = 650) and tested (test dataset: n = 648) using a dataset of 1298 patients with and without type 2 diabetes. To generate predictions, the algorithm utilized key features such as body mass index, plasma fasting glucose, and hemoglobin A1C. Furthermore, a clinical pilot study involving 105 patients was conducted to assess the diagnostic accuracy of the system in comparison to non-endocrinology specialists. The AI-CDSS showed a high degree of accuracy, with 99.8% accuracy in predicting diabetes, 99.3% in predicting prediabetes, 99.2% in identifying at-risk individuals, and 98.8% in predicting no diabetes. The test dataset revealed a 98.8% agreement between endocrinology specialists and the AI-CDSS. Type 2 diabetes was identified in 45% of 105 individuals in the pilot study. Compared with diabetes specialists, the AI-CDSS scored a 98.5% concordance rate, greatly exceeding that of nonendocrinology specialists, who had an 85% agreement rate. These findings indicate that the AI-CDSS has the potential to be a useful tool for accurately identifying type 2 diabetes, especially in situations in which diabetes specialists are not readily available.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Efforts to reduce this exposure by lowering the radiotracer dose or scan time can degrade image quality. While using magnetic resonance (MR) images with clearer anatomical information to restore standard-dose PET (SPET) from low-dose PET (LPET) is a promising approach, it faces challenges with the inconsistencies in the structure and texture of multi-modality fusion, as well as the mismatch in out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this paper, we propose a supervise-assisted multi-modality fusion diffusion model (MFdiff) for addressing these challenges for high-quality PET restoration. Firstly, to fully utilize auxiliary MR images without introducing extraneous details in the restored image, a multi-modality feature fusion module is designed to learn an optimized fusion feature. Secondly, using the fusion feature as an additional condition, high-quality SPET images are iteratively generated based on the diffusion model. Furthermore, we introduce a two-stage supervise-assisted learning strategy that harnesses both generalized priors from simulated in-distribution datasets and specific priors tailored to in-vivo OOD data. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed MFdiff effectively restores high-quality SPET images from multi-modality inputs and outperforms state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing population synthesis approaches predominantly rely on structured attributes and statistical constraints, leaving a gap in semantic-conditioned population generation that can capture abstract behavioral patterns implicitly in survey data. This study proposes SemaPop, a semantic-statistical population synthesis model that integrates large language models (LLMs) with generative population modeling. SemaPop derives high-level persona representations from individual survey records and incorporates them as semantic conditioning signals for population generation, while marginal regularization is introduced to enforce alignment with target population marginals. In this study, the framework is instantiated using a Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) backbone, referred to as SemaPop-GAN. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SemaPop-GAN achieves improved generative performance, yielding closer alignment with target marginal and joint distributions while maintaining sample-level feasibility and diversity under semantic conditioning. Ablation studies further confirm the contribution of semantic persona conditioning and architectural design choices to balancing marginal consistency and structural realism. These results demonstrate that SemaPop-GAN enables controllable and interpretable population synthesis through effective semantic-statistical information fusion. SemaPop-GAN also provides a promising modular foundation for developing generative population projection systems that integrate individual-level behavioral semantics with population-level statistical constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSemaPop-GAN\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u53e3\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u8bed\u4e49-\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4eba\u53e3\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4eba\u53e3\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u8fb9\u9645\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u786e\u4fdd\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u4eba\u53e3\u8fb9\u9645\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4eba\u53e3\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4ece\u8c03\u67e5\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6355\u6349\u62bd\u8c61\u884c\u4e3a\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6761\u4ef6\u4eba\u53e3\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u884c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u4e4b\u95f4\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8868\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u4e2a\u4f53\u8c03\u67e5\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u9ad8\u5c42\u4eba\u7269\u8868\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5e26\u68af\u5ea6\u60e9\u7f5a\u7684Wasserstein GAN\uff08WGAN-GP\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u5e72\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8fb9\u9645\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u786e\u4fdd\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u4eba\u53e3\u8fb9\u9645\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "SemaPop-GAN\u5728\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5bf9\u9f50\u76ee\u6807\u8fb9\u9645\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u4eba\u7269\u6761\u4ef6\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u5e73\u8861\u8fb9\u9645\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bed\u4e49-\u7edf\u8ba1\u4fe1\u606f\u878d\u5408\uff0cSemaPop-GAN\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u878d\u5408\u4e2a\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0e\u4eba\u53e3\u7ea7\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u4eba\u53e3\u6295\u5f71\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

As researchers create more complex memory architectures, it becomes increasingly difficult to analyze their capabilities and guide future memory designs. Most long-term memory benchmarks focus on simple fact retention, multi-hop recall, and time-based changes. While undoubtedly important, these capabilities can often be achieved with simple retrieval-augmented LLMs and do not test complex memory hierarchies. To bridge this gap, we propose StructMemEval - a benchmark that tests the agent's ability to organize its long-term memory, not just factual recall. We gather a suite of tasks that humans solve by organizing their knowledge in a specific structure: transaction ledgers, to-do lists, trees and others. Our initial experiments show that simple retrieval-augmented LLMs struggle with these tasks, whereas memory agents can reliably solve them if prompted how to organize their memory.

Two complementary instantiations are introduced: (i) a conditional Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)-based compression denoiser that explicitly controls the rate-distortion-perception (RDP) trade-off, and (ii) a conditional diffusion-based reconstruction strategy that performs iterative denoising guided by compressed latents.

In dynamic, partially observable environments, communication is often what reduces uncertainty and makes collaboration possible. This survey reviews multi-agent communication (MA-Comm) through the Five Ws: who communicates with whom, what is communicated, when communication occurs, and why communication is beneficial. This framing offers a clean way to connect ideas across otherwise separate research threads. We trace how communication approaches have evolved across three major paradigms. In Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), early methods used hand-designed or implicit protocols, followed by end-to-end learned communication optimized for reward and control. While successful, these protocols are frequently task-specific and hard to interpret, motivating work on Emergent Language (EL), where agents can develop more structured or symbolic communication through interaction. EL methods, however, still struggle with grounding, generalization, and scalability, which has fueled recent interest in large language models (LLMs) that bring natural language priors for reasoning, planning, and collaboration in more open-ended settings. Across MARL, EL, and LLM-based systems, we highlight how different choices shape communication design, where the main trade-offs lie, and what remains unsolved. We distill practical design patterns and open challenges to support future hybrid systems that combine learning, language, and control for scalable and interpretable multi-agent collaboration.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Despite the success of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) in natural language processing and conventional vision tasks, directly applying PEFT to multi-agent settings leads to significant performance degradation and training instability. In this work, we conduct a detailed analysis and identify two key factors: (i) inter-frame redundancy in heterogeneous sensory streams, and (ii) erosion of fine-grained semantics in deep-layer representations under PEFT adaptation. To address these issues, we propose FlowAdapt, a parameter-efficient framework grounded in optimal transport theory, which minimizes information transport costs across both data distributions and network hierarchies. Specifically, we introduce a Wasserstein Greedy Sampling strategy to selectively filter redundant samples via a bounded covering radius. Furthermore, Progressive Knowledge Transfer module is designed to progressively inject compressed early-stage representations into later stages through learnable pathways, alleviating semantic degradation in late-stage adaptation. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that FlowAdapt achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 1% of trainable parameters, effectively bridging domain gaps with superior sample efficiency and generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce MAPLE, a complete modality-aware post-training and learning ecosystem comprising: (1) MAPLE-bench, the first benchmark explicitly annotating minimal signal combinations required per task; (2) MAPO, a modality-aware policy optimization framework that stratifies batches by modality requirement to reduce gradient variance from heterogeneous group advantages; (3) Adaptive weighting and curriculum scheduling that balances and prioritizes harder signal combinations. Systematic analysis across loss aggregation, clipping, sampling, and curriculum design establishes MAPO's optimal training strategy. Adaptive weighting and curriculum focused learning further boost performance across signal combinations.

This assumption -- that useful memories are similar memories -- fails to capture a fundamental property of biological memory: association through temporal co-occurrence. We propose Predictive Associative Memory (PAM), an architecture in which a JEPA-style predictor, trained on temporal co-occurrence within a continuous experience stream, learns to navigate the associative structure of an embedding space. We introduce an Inward JEPA that operates over stored experience (predicting associatively reachable past states) as the complement to the standard Outward JEPA that operates over incoming sensory data (predicting future states). We evaluate PAM as an associative recall system -- testing faithfulness of recall for experienced associations -- rather than as a retrieval system evaluated on generalisation to unseen associations. On a synthetic benchmark, the predictor's top retrieval is a true temporal associate 97% of the time (Association Precision@1 = 0.970); it achieves cross-boundary Recall@20 = 0.421 where cosine similarity scores zero; and it separates experienced-together from never-experienced-together states with a discrimination AUC of 0.916 (cosine: 0.789). Even restricted to cross-room pairs where embedding similarity is uninformative, the predictor achieves AUC = 0.849 (cosine: 0.503, chance). A temporal shuffle control confirms the signal is genuine temporal co-occurrence structure, not embedding geometry: shuffling collapses cross-boundary recall by 90%, replicated across training seeds.

Most existing methods operate either in the image or post-log projection domain, which fails to fully exploit the rich structural information in pre-log measurements while being highly susceptible to noise. The requisite logarithmic transformation critically amplifies noise within these data, imposing exceptional demands on reconstruction precision. To overcome these challenges, we propose PLOT-CT, a novel framework for Pre-Log vOronoi decomposiTion-assisted CT generation. Our method begins by applying Voronoi decomposition to pre-log sinograms, disentangling the data into distinct underlying components, which are embedded in separate latent spaces. This explicit decomposition significantly enhances the model's capacity to learn discriminative features, directly improving reconstruction accuracy by mitigating noise and preserving information inherent in the pre-log domain.

We find the answer is often no. In a study of 3,000 agent runs across three models (Llama 3.1 70B, GPT-4o, and Claude Sonnet 4.5) on HotpotQA, we observe that ReAct-style agents produce 2.0--4.2 distinct action sequences per 10 runs on average, even with identical inputs.

We propose PLESS, a generic pseudo-label enhancement strategy which improves reliability and spatial consistency. It builds on a hierarchical partitioning of the image into a hierarchy of spatially coherent regions. PLESS propagates scribble information to refine pseudo-labels within semantically coherent regions. The framework is model-agnostic and easily integrates into existing pseudo-label methods.

A common challenge arises from solving the PDE families, which are characterized by sharing an identical mathematical structure but varying in specific parameters. Traditional numerical methods, such as the finite element method, need to independently solve each instance within a PDE family, which incurs massive computational cost. On the other hand, while recent advancements in machine learning PDE solvers offer impressive computational speed and accuracy, their inherent ``black-box\" nature presents a considerable limitation. These methods primarily yield numerical approximations, thereby lacking the crucial interpretability provided by analytical expressions, which are essential for deeper scientific insight. To address these limitations, we propose a neuro-assisted multitasking symbolic PDE solver framework for PDE family solving, dubbed NMIPS. In particular, we employ multifactorial optimization to simultaneously discover the analytical solutions of PDEs. To enhance computational efficiency, we devise an affine transfer method by transferring learned mathematical structures among PDEs in a family, avoiding solving each PDE from scratch.

In medicine, such interventions arise in physiological regulation (e.g., cardiovascular system under fluid administration) and pharmacokinetics, among others. Propofol administration is an anesthetic intervention, where the challenge is to estimate the optimal dose required to achieve a target brain concentration for anesthesia, given patient characteristics, while avoiding under- or over-dosing. The pharmacokinetic state is characterized by drug concentrations across tissues, and its dynamics are governed by prior states, patient covariates, drug clearance, and drug administration. While data-driven models can capture complex dynamics, they often fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes. Mechanistic models on the other hand are typically robust, but might be oversimplified. We propose a hybrid mechanistic-data-driven approach to estimate time-dependent intervention outcomes. Our approach decomposes the dynamical system's transition operator into parametric and nonparametric components, further distinguishing between intervention-related and unrelated dynamics. This structure leverages mechanistic anchors while learning residual patterns from data. For scenarios where mechanistic parameters are unknown, we introduce a two-stage procedure: first, pre-training an encoder on simulated data, and subsequently learning corrections from observed data. Two regimes with incomplete mechanistic knowledge are considered: periodic pendulum and Propofol bolus injections.

Existing data selection methods for VIT either require costly training or gradient computation. Training-free alternatives often depend on proxy models or datasets, instruction-agnostic representations, and pairwise similarity with quadratic complexity, limiting scalability and representation fidelity. In this work, we propose ScalSelect, a scalable training-free multimodal data selection method with linear-time complexity with respect to the number of samples, eliminating the need for external models or auxiliary datasets. ScalSelect first constructs sample representations by extracting visual features most attended by instruction tokens in the target VLM, capturing instruction-relevant information. It then identifies samples whose representations best approximate the dominant subspace of the full dataset representations, enabling scalable importance scoring without pairwise comparisons. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs, datasets, and selection budgets demonstrate that ScalSelect achieves over 97.5% of the performance of training on the full dataset using only 16% of the data, and even outperforms full-data training in some settings.

Such instability undermines reliability and limits clinical adoption. In this study, we propose a novel bootstrapping-based regularisation framework that embeds the bootstrapping process directly into the training of deep neural networks. This approach constrains prediction variability across resampled datasets, producing a single model with inherent stability properties. We evaluated models constructed using the proposed regularisation approach against conventional and ensemble models using simulated data and three clinical datasets: GUSTO-I, Framingham, and SUPPORT. Across all datasets, our model exhibited improved prediction stability, with lower mean absolute differences (e.g., 0.019 vs. 0.059 in GUSTO-I; 0.057 vs. 0.088 in Framingham) and markedly fewer significantly deviating predictions. Importantly, discriminative performance and feature importance consistency were maintained, with high SHAP correlations between models (e.g., 0.894 for GUSTO-I; 0.965 for Framingham). While ensemble models achieved greater stability, we show that this came at the expense of interpretability, as each constituent model used predictors in different ways. By regularising predictions to align with bootstrapped distributions, our approach allows prediction models to be developed that achieve greater robustness and reproducibility without sacrificing interpretability.

Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards lacks effective automatic verifiers and struggles to handle complex clinical contexts. Meanwhile, medical alignment requires the simultaneous optimization of correctness, safety, and compliance, yet multi-objective heterogeneous reward signals are prone to scale mismatch and optimization conflicts.To address these challenges, we propose a robust medical alignment paradigm. We first construct a holistic multi-dimensional medical alignment matrix that decomposes alignment objectives into four categories: fundamental capabilities, expert knowledge, online feedback, and format specifications. Within each category, we establish a closed loop of where observable metrics inform attributable diagnosis, which in turn drives optimizable rewards, thereby providing fine-grained, high-resolution supervision signals for subsequent iterative optimization. To resolve gradient domination and optimization instability problem caused by heterogeneous signals, we further propose a unified optimization mechanism. This mechanism employs Reference-Frozen Normalization to align reward scales and implements a Tri-Factor Adaptive Dynamic Weighting strategy to achieve collaborative optimization that is weakness-oriented, risk-prioritized, and redundancy-reducing.

In this work, we pro-pose a novel GR-Diffusion framework that synergistically integrates the geometric priors of GR with the generative power of diffusion models for 3D low-dose whole-body PET reconstruction. GR-Diffusion employs GR to generate a reference 3D PET image from projection data, establishing a physically grounded and structurally explicit benchmark that overcomes the low-pass limitations of conventional point-based or voxel-based methods. This reference image serves as a dual guide during the diffusion process, ensuring both global consistency and local accuracy. Specifically, we employ a hierarchical guidance mechanism based on the GR reference. Fine-grained guidance leverages differences to refine local details, while coarse-grained guidance uses multi-scale difference maps to correct deviations. This strategy allows the diffusion model to sequentially integrate the strong geometric prior from GR and recover sub-voxel information.

For safe driving in unexpected scenarios, these systems may additionally rely on human interventions such as natural language instructions. Using a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) facilitates human-vehicle interaction and can improve performance in such scenarios. However, this approach requires substantial computational resources due to its reliance on an LLM and numerous visual tokens from sensor inputs, which are limited in autonomous vehicles. Many MLLM studies have explored reducing visual tokens, but often suffer end-task performance degradation compared to using all tokens.\n  To enable efficient E2E driving while maintaining performance comparable to using all tokens, this paper proposes the first Supervised Token Reduction framework for multi-modal LLMs (SToRM). The proposed framework consists of three key elements. First, a lightweight importance predictor with short-term sliding windows estimates token importance scores. Second, a supervised training approach uses an auxiliary path to obtain pseudo-supervision signals from an all-token LLM pass. Third, an anchor-context merging module partitions tokens into anchors and context tokens, and merges context tokens into relevant anchors to reduce redundancy while minimizing information loss.

When outcome-based learning reinforces correct answers obtained through incorrect causal models, the agent becomes entrenched in flawed reasoning, a phenomenon we term Aleatoric Entrenchment. We propose Epistemic Regret Minimization (ERM), a belief revision objective that penalizes errors in causal reasoning independently of task success, and embed it within a three-layer architecture with three contributions grounded in knowledge representation: (1) a Physical Grounding Theorem proving that actions satisfying actuator independence implement valid do-operations, bridging action languages and do-calculus; (2) ERM as a causal belief revision operator satisfying AGM postulates, preventing entrenchment even when the agent succeeds for the wrong reasons; and (3) a failure mode taxonomy that classifies recurring reasoning errors and injects domain-independent guards, enabling cross-domain transfer. We prove asymptotic recovery of the true interventional distribution with finite-sample bounds. Experiments on 1,360 causal trap scenarios across six frontier LLMs reveal that Rung Collapse persists even in reasoning-enhanced models (3.7% for GPT-5.2), that steerability exhibits inverse scaling where advanced models resist generic correction, and that targeted ERM feedback recovers 53-59% of entrenched errors where outcome-level feedback fails.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Even state-of-the-art models fail to capture topology and symbolic logic in engineering schematics, as their pixel-driven paradigm discards the explicit vector-defined relations needed for reasoning. To overcome this, we propose a Vector-to-Graph (V2G) pipeline that converts CAD diagrams into property graphs where nodes represent components and edges encode connectivity, making structural dependencies explicit and machine-auditable. On a diagnostic benchmark of electrical compliance checks, V2G yields large accuracy gains across all error categories, while leading MLLMs remain near chance level. These results highlight the systemic inadequacy of pixel-based methods and demonstrate that structure-aware representations provide a reliable path toward practical deployment of multimodal AI in engineering domains.

Yet, in practice, they generalize robustly. We propose that the effective capacity controlling generalization lies in the geometry of the model's internal representations: while the parameter space is high-dimensional, the activation states lie on a low-dimensional, sparse manifold. To formalize this, we introduce the Sparse Semantic Dimension (SSD), a complexity measure derived from the active feature vocabulary of a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) trained on the model's layers. Treating the LLM and SAE as frozen oracles, we utilize this framework to attribute the model's generalization capabilities to the sparsity of the dictionary rather than the total parameter count. Empirically, we validate this framework on GPT-2 Small and Gemma-2B, demonstrating that our bound provides non-vacuous certificates at realistic sample sizes. Crucially, we uncover a counter-intuitive \"feature sharpness\" scaling law: despite being an order of magnitude larger, Gemma-2B requires significantly fewer calibration samples to identify its active manifold compared to GPT-2, suggesting that larger models learn more compressible, distinct semantic structures. Finally, we show that this framework functions as a reliable safety monitor: out-of-distribution inputs trigger a measurable \"feature explosion\" (a sharp spike in active features), effectively signaling epistemic uncertainty through learned feature violation.

Its critical application lies in cluttered environments, where occlusions, limited viewpoints, and noisy masks degrade perception. To address these challenges, we present Clutt3R-Seg, a zero-shot pipeline for robust 3D instance segmentation for language-grounded grasping in cluttered scenes. Our key idea is to introduce a hierarchical instance tree of semantic cues. Unlike prior approaches that attempt to refine noisy masks, our method leverages them as informative cues: through cross-view grouping and conditional substitution, the tree suppresses over- and under-segmentation, yielding view-consistent masks and robust 3D instances. Each instance is enriched with open-vocabulary semantic embeddings, enabling accurate target selection from natural language instructions. To handle scene changes during multi-stage tasks, we further introduce a consistency-aware update that preserves instance correspondences from only a single post-interaction image, allowing efficient adaptation without rescanning. Clutt3R-Seg is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world datasets, and validated on a real robot.

Analysis of model confidence dynamics under latent reasoning reveals that thinking trajectories ending in incorrect answers contain fewer low-confidence steps than those ending in correct answers. Meanwhile, we suggest that soft embeddings aggregated by multiple low-confidence thinking alternatives may introduce and propagate noise, leading to high confidence in unreliable reasoning trajectories. Motivated by these observations, ThinkRouter, an inference-time confidence-aware routing mechanism is proposed to avoid high confidence and noise for efficient reasoning. ThinkRouter routes thinking to the discrete token space when model confidence is low, and to the latent space otherwise. Extensive experiments on STEM reasoning and coding benchmarks across diverse large reasoning models demonstrate that ThinkRouter outperforms explicit CoT, random routing, and latent reasoning baselines in terms of accuracy, achieving an average improvement of 19.70 points in Pass@1, while reducing generation length by up to 15.55%. Further comprehensive analysis reveals that ThinkRouter can calibrate errors arising from explicit CoT and latent reasoning, and accelerates end-of-thinking token generation by globally lowering model confidence.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our approach is built on two observations about diffusion model structure: Noise Alignment: even in early, highly corrupted stages, coarse semantic steering is possible using a lightweight, offline-computed guidance signal, avoiding any per-step or per-sample gradients. Transferable concept vectors: a concept direction in activation space once learned transfers across both {timesteps} and {samples}; the same fixed steering vector learned near low noise level remains effective when injected at intermediate noise levels for every generation trajectory, providing refined conditional control with efficiency. Such concept directions can be efficiently and reliably identified via Recursive Feature Machine (RFM), a light-weight backpropagation-free feature learning method.

To bridge this gap, we collect the first dataset for this task, consisting of approximately 4 hours of video collected from 8 participants during everyday activities. We evaluate a transformer-based gaze estimation model, GLC, on the new dataset and propose two extensions: an auxiliary gaze out-of-bound classification task and a multi-view co-learning approach that jointly trains head-view and neck-view models using a geometry-aware auxiliary loss. Experimental results show that incorporating gaze out-of-bound classification improves performance over standard fine-tuning, while the co-learning approach does not yield gains.

In this work, we propose Sparse Complementary Fusion with reverse KL (SCF-RKL), a novel model merging framework that explicitly controls functional interference through sparse, distribution-aware updates. Instead of assuming linear additivity in parameter space, SCF-RKL measures the functional divergence between models using reverse Kullback-Leibler divergence and selectively incorporates complementary parameters. This mode-seeking, sparsity-inducing design effectively preserves stable representations while integrating new capabilities.

If one were to try to prefetch as much computation as possible, they would attempt to learn a prior over the policies for some yet-to-be-determined reward function. Recent work (forward-backward (FB) representation learning) has tried this, arguing that an unsupervised representation learning procedure can enable optimal control over arbitrary rewards without further fine-tuning. However, FB's training objective and learning behavior remain mysterious. In this paper, we demystify FB by clarifying when such representations can exist, what its objective optimizes, and how it converges in practice. We draw connections with rank matching, fitted Q-evaluation, and contraction mapping. Our analysis suggests a simplified unsupervised pre-training method for RL that, instead of enabling optimal control, performs one step of policy improvement. We call our proposed method $\\textbf{one-step forward-backward representation learning (one-step FB)}$. Experiments in didactic settings, as well as in $10$ state-based and image-based continuous control domains, demonstrate that one-step FB converges to errors $10^5$ smaller and improves zero-shot performance by $+24\\%$ on average.

We present CADET (Context-Conditioned Ads Decoder-Only Transformer), an end-to-end decoder-only transformer for ads CTR prediction deployed at LinkedIn. Our approach introduces several key innovations: (1) a context-conditioned decoding architecture with multi-tower prediction heads that explicitly model post-scoring signals such as ad position, resolving the chicken-and-egg problem between predicted CTR and ranking; (2) a self-gated attention mechanism that stabilizes training by adaptively regulating information flow at both representation and interaction levels; (3) a timestamp-based variant of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) that captures temporal relationships across timescales from seconds to months; (4) session masking strategies that prevent the model from learning dependencies on unavailable in-session events, addressing train-serve skew; and (5) production engineering techniques including tensor packing, sequence chunking, and custom Flash Attention kernels that enable efficient training and serving at scale. In online A/B testing, CADET achieves a 11.04\\% CTR lift compared to the production LiRank baseline model, a hybrid ensemble of DCNv2 and sequential encoders.

As a result, text-to-shape retrieval has become essential in facilitating intuitive search within large repositories. However, existing methods require canonical poses and support few object categories, limiting their real-world applicability where objects can belong to diverse classes and appear in random orientations. To address this challenge, we propose RI-Mamba, the first rotation-invariant state-space model for point clouds. RI-Mamba defines global and local reference frames to disentangle pose from geometry and uses Hilbert sorting to construct token sequences with meaningful geometric structure while maintaining rotation invariance. We further introduce a novel strategy to compute orientational embeddings and reintegrate them via feature-wise linear modulation, effectively recovering spatial context and enhancing model expressiveness. Our strategy is inherently compatible with state-space models and operates in linear time. To scale up retrieval, we adopt cross-modal contrastive learning with automated triplet generation, allowing training on diverse datasets without manual annotation. Extensive experiments demonstrate RI-Mamba's superior representational capacity and robustness, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the OmniObject3D benchmark across more than 200 object categories under arbitrary orientations.

Text2GQL-Bench couples a multi-GQL dataset that has 178,184 (Question, Query) pairs spanning 13 domains, with a scalable construction framework that generates datasets in different domains, question abstraction levels, and GQLs with heterogeneous resources.

Our evaluation uncovers a stark dialect gap in ISO-GQL generation: even strong LLMs achieve only at most 4% execution accuracy (EX) in zero-shot settings, though a fixed 3-shot prompt raises accuracy to around 50%, the grammatical validity remains lower than 70%. Moreover, a fine-tuned 8B open-weight model reaches 45.1% EX, and 90.8% grammatical validity, demonstrating that most of the performance jump is unlocked by exposure to sufficient ISO-GQL examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Prior claims of dominance of the linear model often stem from benchmarks that lack diverse temporal dynamics and employ biased evaluation protocols. We revisit this debate through TimeSynth, a structured framework that emulates key properties of real world time series,including non-stationarity, periodicity, trends, and phase modulation by creating synthesized signals whose parameters are derived from real-world time series. Evaluating four model families Linear, Multi Layer Perceptrons (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and Transformers, we find a systematic bias in linear models: they collapse to simple oscillation regardless of signal complexity. Nonlinear models avoid this collapse and gain clear advantages as signal complexity increases. Notably, Transformers and CNN based models exhibit slightly greater adaptability to complex modulated signals compared to MLPs. Beyond clean forecasting, the framework highlights robustness differences under distribution and noise shifts and removes biases of prior benchmarks by using independent instances for train, test, and validation for each signal family. Collectively, TimeSynth provides a principled foundation for understanding when different forecasting approaches succeed or fail, moving beyond oversimplified claims of model equivalence.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we introduce AIR, the first incident response framework for LLM agent systems. AIR defines a domain-specific language for managing the incident response lifecycle autonomously in LLM agent systems, and integrates it into the agent's execution loop to (1) detect incidents via semantic checks grounded in the current environment state and recent context, (2) guide the agent to execute containment and recovery actions via its tools, and (3) synthesize guardrail rules during eradication to block similar incidents in future executions. We evaluate AIR on three representative agent types. Results show that AIR achieves detection, remediation, and eradication success rates all exceeding 90%. Extensive experiments further confirm the necessity of AIR's key design components, show the timeliness and moderate overhead of AIR, and demonstrate that LLM-generated rules can approach the effectiveness of developer-authored rules across domains.

A multi-resolution hash encoder is employed to capture local spatial priors, regularizing primitive parameters under ultra-sparse settings. We further extend the framework to dynamic reconstruction by introducing time-conditioned representations and a spatiotemporal attention block to adaptively aggregate features, thereby resolving spatiotemporal ambiguities and enforcing temporal coherence.

However, multi-turn RL remains challenging as rewards are often sparse or delayed, and environments can be stochastic. In this regime, naive trajectory sampling can hinder exploitation and induce mode collapse. We propose TSR (Trajectory-Search Rollouts), a training-time approach that repurposes test-time scaling ideas for improved per-turn rollout generation. TSR performs lightweight tree-style search to construct high-quality trajectories by selecting high-scoring actions at each turn using task-specific feedback.

In image classification, these models typically recover human-interpretable concepts from an image and use them for classification. Sparse concept recovery methods leverage the latent space of vision-language models to represent image embeddings as a sparse combination of concept embeddings. However, because such methods ignore the hierarchical structure of concepts, they can produce correct predictions with explanations that are inconsistent with the hierarchy. In this work, we propose Hierarchical Concept Embedding \\& Pursuit (HCEP), a framework that induces a hierarchy of concept embeddings in the latent space and uses hierarchical sparse coding to recover the concepts present in an image. Given a hierarchy of semantic concepts, we construct a corresponding hierarchy of concept embeddings and, assuming the correct concepts for an image form a rooted path in the hierarchy, derive desirable conditions for identifying them in the embedded space. We show that hierarchical sparse coding reliably recovers hierarchical concept embeddings, whereas vanilla sparse coding fails. Our experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that HCEP outperforms baselines in concept precision and recall while maintaining competitive classification accuracy. Moreover, when the number of samples is limited, HCEP achieves superior classification accuracy and concept recovery. These results show that incorporating hierarchical structures into sparse coding yields more reliable and interpretable image classification models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recent approaches using Large Language Models (LLMs) for 3D scene generation show promise but often lack domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design. These limitations lead to reduced control and poor scalability. This paper investigates the use of LLMs to generate agricultural synthetic simulation environments from natural language prompts, specifically to address the limitations of lacking domain-specific reasoning, verification mechanisms, and modular design. A modular multi-LLM pipeline was developed, integrating 3D asset retrieval, domain knowledge injection, and code generation for the Unreal rendering engine using its API. This results in a 3D environment with realistic planting layouts and environmental context, all based on the input prompt and the domain knowledge. To enhance accuracy and scalability, the system employs a hybrid strategy combining LLM optimization techniques such as few-shot prompting, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), finetuning, and validation. Unlike monolithic models, the modular architecture enables structured data handling, intermediate verification, and flexible expansion. The system was evaluated using structured prompts and semantic accuracy metrics. A user study assessed realism and familiarity against real-world images, while an expert comparison demonstrated significant time savings over manual scene design. The results confirm the effectiveness of multi-LLM pipelines in automating domain-specific 3D scene generation with improved reliability and precision.

We introduce FlowBench and show through extensive experiments that our approach outperforms existing methods, providing a reliable paradigm for grounding free-form LLM reasoning into structured workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa Execute-Summarize(ES) \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u79bb\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4ece\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u72ec\u7acb\u91cd\u6784\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LLMs)\u80fd\u591f\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6267\u884c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6784\u5efa\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5e38\u56e0\u4e24\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u5e72\u6270\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528 Execute-Summarize(ES) \u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u5b8c\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4ece\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u72ec\u7acb\u91cd\u6784\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u5206\u79bb\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165 FlowBench \u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u65e0\u7ea6\u675fLLM\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "ES\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u6784\u5efa\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u751f\u6210\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8026\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The contribution is twofold. First, an operator defined via the external division of two Bregman proximity operators is introduced to promote sparse solutions while mitigating the estimation bias induced by classical $\\ell_1$-norm regularization. This operator is then embedded into the already established NoLips algorithm, replacing the standard Bregman proximity operator in a plug-and-play manner. Second, the geometric structure of the proposed external-division operator is elucidated through two complementary reformulations, which provide clear interpretations in terms of the primal and dual spaces of the Poisson inverse problem. Numerical tests show that the proposed method exhibits more stable convergence behavior than conventional Kullback-Leibler (KL)-based approaches and achieves significantly superior performance on synthetic data and an image restoration problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u6cca\u677e\u566a\u58f0\u6c61\u67d3\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u7a00\u758f\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u9664\u6cd5Bregman\u90bb\u8fd1\u7b97\u5b50\u6765\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7a00\u758f\u89e3\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4f20\u7edf\u21131\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u5176\u5d4c\u5165NoLips\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u3002\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8eKL\u6563\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u21131\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u5411\u91cf\u6062\u590d\u4e2d\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u4f30\u8ba1\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6cca\u677e\u566a\u58f0\u6c61\u67d3\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684KL\u6563\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u591f\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u53c8\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6cca\u677e\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u7a33\u5b9a\u6536\u655b\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7Bregman\u90bb\u8fd1\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u9664\u6cd5\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u5b50\u80fd\u591f\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7a00\u758f\u89e3\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u4f20\u7edf\u21131\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u6b64\u7b97\u5b50\u4ee5\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u65b9\u5f0f\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u5df2\u6709\u7684NoLips\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u6807\u51c6\u7684Bregman\u90bb\u8fd1\u7b97\u5b50\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u91cd\u6784\u5f62\u5f0f\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u5916\u90e8\u9664\u6cd5\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u6cca\u677e\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u5bf9\u5076\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eKL\u6563\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u90fd\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u6210\u529f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6cca\u677e\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7a00\u758f\u5411\u91cf\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u9664\u6cd5Bregman\u90bb\u8fd1\u7b97\u5b50\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u21131\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5d4c\u5165NoLips\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6536\u655b\u548c\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6cca\u677e\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6062\u590d\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

To address this problem, we propose LAVES, a hierarchical LLM-based multi-agent system for generating high-quality instructional videos from educational problems. The LAVES formulates educational video generation as a multi-objective task that simultaneously demands correct step-by-step reasoning, pedagogically coherent narration, semantically faithful visual demonstrations, and precise audio--visual alignment. To address the limitations of prior approaches--including low procedural fidelity, high production cost, and limited controllability--LAVES decomposes the generation workflow into specialized agents coordinated by a central Orchestrating Agent with explicit quality gates and iterative critique mechanisms. Specifically, the Orchestrating Agent supervises a Solution Agent for rigorous problem solving, an Illustration Agent that produces executable visualization codes, and a Narration Agent for learner-oriented instructional scripts. In addition, all outputs from the working agents are subject to semantic critique, rule-based constraints, and tool-based compilation checks.

We show that RLVR induces a distinctive behavioral signature: prompts encountered during RLVR training result in more rigid and similar generations, while unseen prompts retain greater diversity. We introduce Min-$k$NN Distance, a simple black-box detector that quantifies this collapse by sampling multiple completions for a given prompt and computing the average of the $k$ smallest nearest-neighbor edit distances.

However, since CLIP has a built-in bias from pretraining on highly imbalanced web-crawled data, SE inevitably results in producing biased estimates of uncertainty entropy. To address this issue, we notably find and demonstrate that Tsallis Entropy (TE), a generalized form of SE, is naturally suited for characterizing biased distributions by introducing a non-extensive parameter q, with the performance of SE serving as a lower bound for TE. Building upon this, we generalize TE into Adaptive Debiasing Tsallis Entropy (ADTE) for TTA, customizing a class-specific parameter q^l derived by normalizing the estimated label bias from continuously incoming test instances, for each category. This adaptive approach allows ADTE to accurately select high-confidence views and seamlessly integrate with a label adjustment strategy to enhance adaptation, without introducing distribution-specific hyperparameter tuning. Besides, our investigation reveals that both TE and ADTE can serve as direct, advanced alternatives to SE in TTA, without any other modifications. Experimental results show that ADTE outperforms state-of-the-art methods on ImageNet and its five variants, and achieves the highest average performance on 10 cross-domain benchmarks, regardless of the model architecture or text prompts used.

Semantic ID-based approaches effectively discretize this information into compact tokens. However, two challenges persist: (1) Suboptimal Tokenization: existing methods (e.g., RQ-VAE) lack disentanglement between shared cross-modal semantics and modality-specific details, causing redundancy or collapse; (2) Architecture-Data Mismatch: vanilla Transformers treat semantic IDs as flat streams, ignoring the hierarchy of user interactions, items, and tokens. Expanding items into multiple tokens amplifies length and noise, biasing attention toward local details over holistic semantics. We propose Hi-SAM, a Hierarchical Structure-Aware Multi-modal framework with two designs: (1) Disentangled Semantic Tokenizer (DST): unifies modalities via geometry-aware alignment and quantizes them via a coarse-to-fine strategy. Shared codebooks distill consensus while modality-specific ones recover nuances from residuals, enforced by mutual information minimization; (2) Hierarchical Memory-Anchor Transformer (HMAT): splits positional encoding into inter- and intra-item subspaces via Hierarchical RoPE to restore hierarchy.

Recent work by Chakraborty et al, introduced a fair variant under proportionate fairness and obtained a constant-factor approximation by naively selecting the best closest fair input clustering; however, their offline approach requires storing all input clusterings, which is prohibitively expensive for most large-scale applications.\n  In this paper, we initiate the study of fair consensus clustering in the streaming model, where input clusterings arrive sequentially and memory is limited. We design the first constant-factor algorithm that processes the stream while storing only a logarithmic number of inputs. En route, we introduce a new generic algorithmic framework that integrates closest fair clustering with cluster fitting, yielding improved approximation guarantees not only in the streaming setting but also when revisited offline. Furthermore, the framework is fairness-agnostic: it applies to any fairness definition for which an approximately close fair clustering can be computed efficiently.

While coding LLMs have advanced static 3D scene generation, extending this paradigm to 4D dynamics remains a critical frontier. This task presents two fundamental challenges: multi-scale context entanglement, where monolithic generation fails to balance local object structures with global environmental layouts; and a semantic-physical execution gap, where open-loop code generation leads to physical hallucinations lacking dynamic fidelity. We introduce Code2Worlds, a framework that formulates 4D generation as language-to-simulation code generation. First, we propose a dual-stream architecture that disentangles retrieval-augmented object generation from hierarchical environmental orchestration. Second, to ensure dynamic fidelity, we establish a physics-aware closed-loop mechanism in which a PostProcess Agent scripts dynamics, coupled with a VLM-Motion Critic that performs self-reflection to iteratively refine simulation code. Evaluations on the Code4D benchmark show Code2Worlds outperforms baselines with a 41% SGS gain and 49% higher Richness, while uniquely generating physics-aware dynamics absent in prior static methods.

Unlike natural image fields, meteorological fields lack task-agnostic foundation models and explicit semantic structures, making VFM-based regularization inapplicable. Moreover, existing frequency-based approaches impose identical spectral regularization across channels under a homogeneity assumption, which leads to uneven regularization strength under the inter-variable spectral heterogeneity in multivariate meteorological data. To address these challenges, we propose a 3D Masked AutoEncoder (3D-MAE) that encodes weather-state evolution features as an additional conditioning for the diffusion model, together with a Variable-Aware Masked Frequency Modeling (VA-MFM) strategy that adaptively selects thresholds based on the spectral energy distribution of each variable. Together, we propose PuYun-LDM, which enhances latent diffusability and achieves superior performance to ENS at short lead times while remaining comparable to ENS at longer horizons.

This missing outside-option information makes market-size and preference estimation difficult even in simple multinomial logit (MNL) models, and it is a central obstacle in practice when only transaction data are recorded. Existing approaches often rely on auxiliary market-share, aggregated, or cross-market data. We study a complementary setting in which a black-box auxiliary predictor provides outside-option probabilities, but is potentially biased or miscalibrated because it was trained in a different channel, period, or population, or produced by an external machine-learning system. We develop calibration methods that turn such imperfect predictions into statistically valid no-purchase estimates using purchase-only data from the focal environment. First, under affine miscalibration in logit space, we show that a simple regression identifies outside-option utility parameters and yields consistent recovery of no-purchase probabilities without collecting new labels for no-purchase events. Second, under a weaker nearly monotone condition, we propose a rank-based calibration method and derive finite-sample error bounds that cleanly separate auxiliary-predictor quality from first-stage utility-learning error over observed in-set choices. Our analysis also translates estimation error into downstream decision quality for assortment optimization, quantifying how calibration accuracy affects revenue performance. The bounds provide explicit dependence on predictor alignment and utility-learning error, clarifying when each source dominates. Numerical experiments demonstrate improvements in no-purchase estimation and downstream assortment decisions, and we discuss robust aggregation extensions for combining multiple auxiliary predictors.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce a lightweight framework that reuses the main model's internal hidden states for efficient length prediction. Our framework features two core components: 1) Entropy-Guided Token Pooling (EGTP), which uses on-the-fly activations and token entropy for highly accurate static prediction with negligible cost, and 2) Progressive Length Prediction (PLP), which dynamically estimates the remaining length at each decoding step to handle stochastic generation. To validate our approach, we build and release ForeLen, a comprehensive benchmark with long-sequence, Chain-of-Thought, and RL data. On ForeLen, EGTP achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, reducing MAE by 29.16\\% over the best baseline. Integrating our methods with a length-aware scheduler yields significant end-to-end throughput gains. Our work provides a new technical and evaluation baseline for efficient LLM inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, objectively measuring the theoretical performance ceilings of diverse architectures across heterogeneous platforms remains a formidable challenge. In this work, we propose a systematic framework based on the Roofline model that unifies architectural primitives and hardware constraints through the lens of operational intensity (OI). By defining an inference-potential region, we introduce the Relative Inference Potential as a novel metric to compare efficiency differences between Large Language Models (LLMs) on the same hardware substrate. Extensive empirical analysis across diverse compute tiers reveals that variations in performance and OI are significantly influenced by sequence length. We further identify a critical regression in OI as model depth increases. Additionally, our findings highlight an efficiency trap induced by hardware heterogeneity and demonstrate how structural refinements, such as Multi-head Latent Attention (M LA), can effectively unlock latent inference potential across various hardware substrates. These insights provide actionable directions for hardware-software co-design to align neural structures with physical constraints in on-device intelligence.

Rooted in latent space geometry, REVIS extracts the pure visual information vector via orthogonal projection and employs a calibrated strategy to perform sparse intervention only at the precise depth where suppression occurs. This surgical approach effectively restores visual information with minimal computational cost. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks demonstrate that REVIS reduces object hallucination rates by approximately 19% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while preserving general reasoning capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

One such synthetic data generation method is Formula Driven Supervised Learning (FDSL), which can provide an infinite number of perfectly labeled data through a formula driven approach, such as fractals or contours. FDSL does not have common drawbacks like manual labor, privacy and other ethical concerns. In this work we generate 3D fractals using 3D Iterated Function Systems (IFS) for pre-training an action recognition model. The fractals are temporally transformed to form a video that is used as a pre-training dataset for downstream task of action recognition. We find that standard methods of generating fractals are slow and produce degenerate 3D fractals. Therefore, we systematically explore alternative ways of generating fractals and finds that overly-restrictive approaches, while generating aesthetically pleasing fractals, are detrimental for downstream task performance. We propose a novel method, Targeted Smart Filtering, to address both the generation speed and fractal diversity issue. The method reports roughly 100 times faster sampling speed and achieves superior downstream performance against other 3D fractal filtering methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Furthermore, while autoregressive LMs can output explicit reasoning, their true reasoning process is opaque, which introduces risks like deception and hallucination. In this work, we introduce the Prototype Transformer (ProtoT) -- an autoregressive LM architecture based on prototypes (parameter vectors), posed as an alternative to the standard self-attention-based transformers. ProtoT works by means of two-way communication between the input sequence and the prototypes, and we show that this leads to the prototypes automatically capturing nameable concepts (e.g. \"woman\") during training. They provide the potential to interpret the model's reasoning and allow for targeted edits of its behavior. Furthermore, by design, the prototypes create communication channels that aggregate contextual information at different time scales, aiding interpretability. In terms of computation scalability, ProtoT scales linearly with sequence length vs the quadratic scalability of SOTA self-attention transformers. Compared to baselines, ProtoT scales well with model and data size, and performs well on text generation and downstream tasks (GLUE). ProtoT exhibits robustness to input perturbations on par or better than some baselines, but differs from them by providing interpretable pathways showing how robustness and sensitivity arises. Reaching close to the performance of state-of-the-art architectures, ProtoT paves the way to creating well-performing autoregressive LMs interpretable by design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u539f\u578b\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08ProtoT\uff09\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u5b83\u901a\u8fc7\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0e\u539f\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u901a\u4fe1\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u539f\u578b\u80fd\u81ea\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u53ef\u547d\u540d\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u5b9a\u5411\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u9886\u57df\u8d85\u8d8a\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4eba\u7c7b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u635f\u5bb3\u4e86\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002\u81ea\u56de\u5f52LM\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u8f93\u51fa\u660e\u786e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u771f\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u900f\u660e\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6b3a\u9a97\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u7b49\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u539f\u578b\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff08ProtoT\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u578b\uff08\u53c2\u6570\u5411\u91cf\uff09\u66ff\u4ee3\u6807\u51c6\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8f93\u5165\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0e\u539f\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u4f7f\u539f\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u81ea\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u53ef\u547d\u540d\u6982\u5ff5\uff08\u5982\u201c\u5973\u6027\u201d\uff09\u3002\u539f\u578b\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u805a\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u901a\u9053\u3002", "result": "ProtoT\u5728\u5e8f\u5217\u957f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e8c\u6b21\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u3002\u968f\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff08GLUE\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u6216\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4ea7\u751f\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "ProtoT\u6027\u80fd\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u53ca\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Through an in-depth analysis, we find that commonly used visual representations in VLAs, whether pretrained via language-image contrastive learning or image-based self-supervised learning, remain inadequate at capturing crucial, task-relevant environment information and at inducing effective policy priors, i.e., anticipatory knowledge of how the environment evolves under successful task execution. In contrast, we discover that predictive embeddings pretrained on videos, in particular V-JEPA 2, are adept at flexibly discarding unpredictable environment factors and encoding task-relevant temporal dynamics, thereby effectively compensating for key shortcomings of existing visual representations in VLAs. Building on these observations, we introduce JEPA-VLA, a simple yet effective approach that adaptively integrates predictive embeddings into existing VLAs.

Under review", "summary": "Dynamic maps (DM) serve as the fundamental information infrastructure for vehicle-road-cloud (VRC) cooperative autonomous driving in China and Japan. By providing comprehensive traffic scene representations, DM overcome the limitations of standalone autonomous driving systems (ADS), such as physical occlusions. Although DM-enhanced ADS have been successfully deployed in real-world applications in Japan, existing DM systems still lack a natural-language-supported (NLS) human interface, which could substantially enhance human-DM interaction. To address this gap, this paper introduces VRCsim, a VRC cooperative perception (CP) simulation framework designed to generate streaming VRC-CP data. Based on VRCsim, we construct a question-answering data set, VRC-QA, focused on spatial querying and reasoning in mixed-traffic scenes. Building upon VRCsim and VRC-QA, we further propose Talk2DM, a plug-and-play module that extends VRC-DM systems with NLS querying and commonsense reasoning capabilities. Talk2DM is built upon a novel chain-of-prompt (CoP) mechanism that progressively integrates human-defined rules with the commonsense knowledge of large language models (LLMs). Experiments on VRC-QA show that Talk2DM can seamlessly switch across different LLMs while maintaining high NLS query accuracy, demonstrating strong generalization capability. Although larger models tend to achieve higher accuracy, they incur significant efficiency degradation.

We argue that fitting a single model to capture both effects creates an optimization conflict: the high-variance updates needed for cross-dimension modeling can corrupt the gradients that support autoregression, resulting in brittle training and degraded long-horizon accuracy. To address this, we propose ALTTS, a dual-path framework that explicitly decouples autoregression and cross-relation (CR) modeling. In ALTTS, the AR path is instantiated with a linear predictor, while the CR path uses a Transformer equipped with Cross-Relation Self-Attention (CRSA); the two branches are coordinated via alternating optimization to isolate gradient noise and reduce cross-block interference. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that ALTTS consistently outperforms prior methods, with the most pronounced improvements on long-horizon forecasting.

By learning a continuous velocity field that transforms simple noise into complex data, RF-based models not only enable high-quality generation, but also support training-free inversion, which facilitates downstream tasks such as reconstruction and editing. However, existing inversion methods, such as vanilla RF-based inversion, suffer from approximation errors that accumulate across timesteps, leading to unstable velocity fields and degraded reconstruction and editing quality. To address this challenge, we propose Proximal-Mean Inversion (PMI), a training-free gradient correction method that stabilizes the velocity field by guiding it toward a running average of past velocities, constrained within a theoretically derived spherical Gaussian.

To capture this, we propose the Hierarchical Sparse Autoencoder (HSAE), which jointly learns a series of SAEs and the parent-child relationships between their features. HSAE strengthens the alignment between parent and child features through two novel mechanisms: a structural constraint loss and a random feature perturbation mechanism. Extensive experiments across various LLMs and layers demonstrate that HSAE consistently recovers semantically meaningful hierarchies, supported by both qualitative case studies and rigorous quantitative metrics.

Krause Attention replaces similarity-based global aggregation with distance-based, localized, and selectively sparse interactions, promoting structured local synchronization instead of global mixing. We relate this behavior to recent theory modeling Transformer dynamics as interacting particle systems, and show how bounded-confidence interactions naturally moderate attention concentration and alleviate attention sinks. Restricting interactions to local neighborhoods also reduces runtime complexity from quadratic to linear in sequence length.

Recent \"Thinking-with-Images\" methods alleviate this by iteratively zooming in and out regions of interest during inference, but incur high latency due to repeated tool calls and visual re-encoding. To address this, we propose Region-to-Image Distillation, which transforms zooming from an inference-time tool into a training-time primitive, thereby internalizing the benefits of agentic zooming into a single forward pass of an MLLM. In particular, we first zoom in to micro-cropped regions to let strong teacher models generate high-quality VQA data, and then distill this region-grounded supervision back to the full image. After training on such data, the smaller student model improves \"single-glance\" fine-grained perception without tool use. To rigorously evaluate this capability, we further present ZoomBench, a hybrid-annotated benchmark of 845 VQA data spanning six fine-grained perceptual dimensions, together with a dual-view protocol that quantifies the global--regional \"zooming gap\". Experiments show that our models achieve leading performance across multiple fine-grained perception benchmarks, and also improve general multimodal cognition on benchmarks such as visual reasoning and GUI agents. We further discuss when \"Thinking-with-Images\" is necessary versus when its gains can be distilled into a single forward pass.

Selective Abstraction for Reliable Long-Form Text Generation", "comment": null, "summary": "LLMs are widely used, yet they remain prone to factual errors that erode user trust and limit adoption in high-risk settings. One approach to mitigate this risk is to equip models with uncertainty estimation mechanisms that abstain when confidence is low. However, this binary \"all-or-nothing\" approach is excessively restrictive in long-form settings, often discarding valuable information. We introduce Selective Abstraction (SA), a framework that enables LLMs to trade specificity for reliability by selectively reducing the detail of uncertain content. We first formalize SA through the lenses of selective risk and coverage. We then propose Atom-wise Selective Abstraction, a claim-level instantiation that decomposes responses into atomic claims (short, self-contained statements each expressing a single fact) and replaces uncertain atoms with higher confidence, less specific abstractions. To evaluate this framework, we develop a novel end-to-end pipeline for open-ended generation that instantiates risk as factual correctness and measures coverage using an information-theoretic measure of retained information. Across six open-source models on the FactScore and LongFact-Objects benchmarks, atom-wise SA consistently outperforms existing baselines, improving the area under the risk-coverage curve (AURC) by up to 27.73% over claim removal, demonstrating that reducing specificity can boost accuracy and reliability while preserving most of their original meaning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u62bd\u8c61\uff08SA\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u4f4e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u6765\u4ea4\u6362\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5168\u6216\u65e0\u7684\u7981\u8a00\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u673a\u5236\u5728\u957f\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4e25\u683c\uff0c\u5f80\u5f80\u4e22\u5f03\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5bb9\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4fdd\u7559\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u62bd\u8c61\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u4e3a\u539f\u5b50\u7ea7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u62bd\u8c61\uff08ASA\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u54cd\u5e94\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u539f\u5b50\u58f0\u660e\uff08\u77ed\u5c0f\u3001\u81ea\u542b\u7684\u5355\u4e2a\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9648\u8ff0\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u66f4\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3001\u66f4\u4f4e\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u66ff\u6362\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u539f\u5b50\u3002", "result": "\u5728FactScore\u548cLongFact-Objects\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u539f\u5b50\u7ea7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u62bd\u8c61\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c06\u98ce\u9669-\u8986\u76d6\u7387\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e0b\u9762\u79ef\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6700\u591a27.73%\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u964d\u4f4e\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u59cb\u542b\u4e49\u7684\u5927\u90e8\u5206\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u62bd\u8c61\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4fe1\u606f\u542b\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u653e\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027-\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u6743\u8861\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing automated methods primarily follow two paradigms: Decoupled Factor Generation, which treats factor discovery as isolated events, and Iterative Factor Evolution, which focuses on local parent-child refinements. However, both paradigms lack a global structural view, often treating factor pools as unstructured collections or fragmented chains, which leads to redundant search and limited diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AlphaPROBE (Alpha Mining via Principled Retrieval and On-graph Biased Evolution), a framework that reframes alpha mining as the strategic navigation of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). By modeling factors as nodes and evolutionary links as edges, AlphaPROBE treats the factor pool as a dynamic, interconnected ecosystem. The framework consists of two core components: a Bayesian Factor Retriever that identifies high-potential seeds by balancing exploitation and exploration through a posterior probability model, and a DAG-aware Factor Generator that leverages the full ancestral trace of factors to produce context-aware, nonredundant optimizations.

This dependency incurs significant data-collection costs, risks embedding human cognitive biases, and confines the reinforcement learning stage to objectively assessable domains like mathematics and coding, leaving a wide range of unverifiable tasks beyond its scope. To overcome these limitations, we introduce NRT (Native Reasoning Training), a novel framework that cultivates complex reasoning by having the model generate its own reasoning traces using only standard question-answer pairs, thereby obviating the need for expert-written demonstrations. NRT reframes the training problem by treating the reasoning process as a latent variable. It employs a unified training objective that models reasoning as an optimization problem, intrinsically rewarding paths that increase the model's likelihood of producing the ground-truth answer. This unified perspective allows us to analyze intrinsic failure modes of prior methods, such as policy collapse, and systematically design more robust reward aggregation functions, creating a self-reinforcing feedback loop where the model learns to think in ways that resolve its own uncertainty. Empirical evaluation on Llama and Mistral model families demonstrates that NRT achieves state-of-the-art performance among verifier-free methods, significantly outperforming standard SFT baselines and prior verifier-free RL methods. Our approach yields particularly strong performance gains in complex reasoning domains and exhibits high robustness to policy collapse, offering a general, scalable path toward building more powerful and broadly applicable reasoning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In recent years, several ring artifact reduction solutions have been proposed in the image domain or in the sinogram domain using supervised deep learning methods. However, these methods require dedicated datasets for training, leading to a high data collection cost. Furthermore, existing approaches focus exclusively on either image-space or sinogram-space correction, neglecting the intrinsic correlations from the forward operation of the CT geometry. Based on the theoretical analysis of non-ideal CT detector responses, the RAR problem is reformulated as an inverse problem by using an unrolled network, which considers non-ideal response together with linear forward-projection with CT geometry. Additionally, the intrinsic correlations of ring artifacts between the sinogram and image domains are leveraged through synthetic data derived from natural images, enabling the trained model to correct artifacts without requiring real-world clinical data. Extensive evaluations on diverse scanning geometries and anatomical regions demonstrate that the model trained on synthetic data consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, current LLM-based methods primarily follow either an Asset-Centric paradigm focused on individual stock prediction or a Market-Centric approach for portfolio allocation, often remaining agnostic to the underlying reasoning that drives market movements. In this paper, we propose a Logic-Oriented perspective, modeling the financial market as a dynamic, evolutionary ecosystem of competing investment narratives, termed Modes of Thought. To operationalize this view, we introduce MEME (Modeling the Evolutionary Modes of Financial Markets), designed to reconstruct market dynamics through the lens of evolving logics. MEME employs a multi-agent extraction module to transform noisy data into high-fidelity Investment Arguments and utilizes Gaussian Mixture Modeling to uncover latent consensus within a semantic space. To model semantic drift among different market conditions, we also implement a temporal evaluation and alignment mechanism to track the lifecycle and historical profitability of these modes. By prioritizing enduring market wisdom over transient anomalies, MEME ensures that portfolio construction is guided by robust reasoning. Extensive experiments on three heterogeneous Chinese stock pools from 2023 to 2025 demonstrate that MEME consistently outperforms seven SOTA baselines. Further ablation studies, sensitivity analysis, lifecycle case study and cost analysis validate MEME's capacity to identify and adapt to the evolving consensus of financial markets.

Existing solutions face a trade-off: Parametric Adaptation can cause catastrophic forgetting and requires costly multi-domain maintenance, while Non-Parametric Retrieval improves forecasts but incurs high inference latency due to datastore search. We propose Parametric Memory Distillation and implement it as TS-Memory, a lightweight memory adapter that augments frozen TSFMs. TS-Memory is trained in two stages. First, we construct an offline, leakage-safe kNN teacher that synthesizes confidence-aware quantile targets from retrieved futures. Second, we distill this retrieval-induced distributional correction into a lightweight memory adapter via confidence-gated supervision. During inference, TS-Memory fuses memory and backbone predictions with constant-time overhead, enabling retrieval-free deployment. Experiments across diverse TSFMs and benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in both point and probabilistic forecasting over representative adaptation methods, with efficiency comparable to the frozen backbone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TS-Memory\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u84b8\u998f\u6280\u672f\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0b\u6e38\u9886\u57df\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u9002\u5e94\u4e0b\u6e38\u9886\u57df\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u9002\u5e94\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u591a\u57df\u7ef4\u62a4\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u68c0\u7d22\u867d\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u9884\u6d4b\u4f46\u4f1a\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u50a8\u641c\u7d22\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u84b8\u998f\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e3aTS-Memory\uff08\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff09\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1a1\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u79bb\u7ebf\u3001\u9632\u6cc4\u9732\u7684kNN\u6559\u5e08\uff0c\u4ece\u68c0\u7d22\u5230\u7684\u672a\u6765\u5e8f\u5217\u5408\u6210\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5206\u4f4d\u6570\u76ee\u6807\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u95e8\u63a7\u76d1\u7763\u5c06\u68c0\u7d22\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u6821\u6b63\u84b8\u998f\u5230\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bb0\u5fc6\u9002\u914d\u5668\u4e2d\u3002\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\uff0cTS-Memory\u4ee5\u6052\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u5f00\u9500\u878d\u5408\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u4e3b\u5e72\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u514d\u68c0\u7d22\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u51bb\u7ed3\u4e3b\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "TS-Memory\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u8bb0\u5fc6\u84b8\u998f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u514d\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

We also provide a simple observe-before-act baseline (ObAct) that integrates short-term observations with the current frame via spatiotemporal attention to predict actions, achieving an 8.1% improvement in location success rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6784\u5efa\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u624b-\u7269\u52a8\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08HOI\uff09\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5728\u7ebf\u95ed\u73af\u8bc4\u6d4b\u5e73\u53f0DynaHOI-Gym\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6DynaHOI-10M\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u540e\u884c\u52a8\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5ObAct\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u624b\u90e8\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u9759\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u800c\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u79fb\u52a8\u76ee\u6807\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u534f\u8c03\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u8bc4\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u6784\u5efaDynaHOI-Gym\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u57fa\u4e8erollout\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u8bc4\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\uff1b2\uff09\u521b\u5efa\u5305\u542b1000\u4e07\u5e27\u300118\u4e07\u6761\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u51c6DynaHOI-10M\uff0c\u63098\u4e2a\u5927\u7c7b\u548c22\u4e2a\u5b50\u7c7b\u7ec4\u7ec7\u76ee\u6807\u8fd0\u52a8\uff1b3\uff09\u63d0\u51faObAct\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u7a7a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u878d\u5408\u77ed\u671f\u89c2\u5bdf\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u5f53\u524d\u5e27\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "ObAct\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u53478.1%\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u89c2\u5bdf-\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u624b-\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DynaHOI-Gym\u5e73\u53f0\u53ca\u5176\u914d\u5957\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u624b-\u7269\u4ea4\u4e92\u8bc4\u6d4b\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684ObAct\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u53c2\u7167\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u5411\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Unlike prior static or synchronous evaluations, Gaia2 introduces scenarios where environments evolve independently of agent actions, requiring agents to operate under temporal constraints, adapt to noisy and dynamic events, resolve ambiguity, and collaborate with other agents. Each scenario is paired with a write-action verifier, enabling fine-grained, action-level evaluation and making Gaia2 directly usable for reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models shows that no model dominates across capabilities: GPT-5 (high) reaches the strongest overall score of 42% pass@1 but fails on time-sensitive tasks, Claude-4 Sonnet trades accuracy and speed for cost, Kimi-K2 leads among open-source models with 21% pass@1. These results highlight fundamental trade-offs between reasoning, efficiency, robustness, and expose challenges in closing the \"sim2real\" gap. Gaia2 is built on a consumer environment with the open-source Agents Research Environments platform and designed to be easy to extend.

In this work, we study the implicit bias of mini-batch stochastic steepest descent in multi-class classification, characterizing how batch size, momentum, and variance reduction shape the limiting max-margin behavior and convergence rates under general entry-wise and Schatten-$p$ norms. We show that without momentum, convergence only occurs with large batches, yielding a batch-dependent margin gap but the full-batch convergence rate. In contrast, momentum enables small-batch convergence through a batch-momentum trade-off, though it slows convergence. This approach provides fully explicit, dimension-free rates that improve upon prior results. Moreover, we prove that variance reduction can recover the exact full-batch implicit bias for any batch size, albeit at a slower convergence rate. Finally, we further investigate the batch-size-one steepest descent without momentum, and reveal its convergence to a fundamentally different bias via a concrete data example, which reveals a key limitation of purely stochastic updates. Overall, our unified analysis clarifies when stochastic optimization aligns with full-batch behavior, and paves the way for perform deeper explorations of the training behavior of stochastic gradient steepest descent algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u968f\u673a\u6700\u9661\u4e0b\u964d\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u52a8\u91cf\u548c\u65b9\u5dee\u7f29\u51cf\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6781\u9650\u6700\u5927\u95f4\u9694\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u52a8\u91cf\u4f7f\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u6536\u655b\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u65b9\u5dee\u7f29\u51cf\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u5168\u6279\u6b21\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u591a\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982SignSGD\u548cMuon\uff09\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u8303\u6570\u8bf1\u5bfc\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u9661\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u968f\u673a\u6700\u9661\u4e0b\u964d\u5728\u591a\u7c7b\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u5dee\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u52a8\u91cf\u548c\u65b9\u5dee\u7f29\u51cf\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6781\u9650\u6700\u5927\u95f4\u9694\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u968f\u673a\u6700\u9661\u4e0b\u964d\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u9010\u5143\u7d20\u8303\u6570\u548cSchatten-p\u8303\u6570\u4e0b\uff0c\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u3001\u52a8\u91cf\u548c\u65b9\u5dee\u7f29\u51cf\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6781\u9650\u6700\u5927\u95f4\u9694\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u65e0\u52a8\u91cf\u65f6\u4ec5\u5728\u5927\u6279\u91cf\u4e0b\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6279\u91cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u95f4\u9694\u5dee\u8ddd\u4f46\u5177\u6709\u5168\u6279\u6b21\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\uff1b\u52a8\u91cf\u901a\u8fc7\u6279\u91cf-\u52a8\u91cf\u6743\u8861\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u6536\u655b\u4f46\u51cf\u6162\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\uff1b\u65b9\u5dee\u7f29\u51cf\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u4efb\u4f55\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u5168\u6279\u6b21\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u5dee\u4f46\u6536\u655b\u8f83\u6162\uff1b\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u4e3a1\u7684\u65e0\u52a8\u91cf\u6700\u9661\u4e0b\u964d\u4f1a\u6536\u655b\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u4f55\u65f6\u4e0e\u5168\u6279\u6b21\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u52a8\u91cf\u5728\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u6536\u655b\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u65b9\u5dee\u7f29\u51cf\u6062\u590d\u5168\u6279\u6b21\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u6700\u9661\u4e0b\u964d\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u884c\u4e3a\u94fa\u5e73\u4e86\u9053\u8def\u3002"}}

We propose a novel framework that synthesises both LGE images and their corresponding segmentation masks using implicit neural representations (INRs) combined with denoising diffusion models. Our approach first trains INRs to capture continuous spatial representations of LGE data and associated myocardium and fibrosis masks. These INRs are then compressed into compact latent embeddings, preserving essential anatomical information. A diffusion model operates on this latent space to generate new representations, which are decoded into synthetic LGE images with anatomically consistent segmentation masks. Experiments on 133 cardiac MRI scans suggest that augmenting training data with 200 synthetic volumes contributes to improved fibrosis segmentation performance, with the Dice score showing an increase from 0.509 to 0.524.

In this study, we propose the Clinical Semantics Evaluator (CSEval), a framework that leverages language models to assess clinical semantic alignment between the generated images and their conditioning prompts.

However, despite their rapid proliferation, the field lacks a unified understanding of existing methodologies and a standardized evaluation framework. To fill this gap, we map the benchmark design space along two axes: (i) from the model perspective, we organize BFMs under a self-supervised learning (SSL) taxonomy; and (ii) from the dataset perspective, we summarize common downstream tasks and curate representative public datasets across clinical and human-centric neurotechnology applications. Building on this consolidation, we introduce Brain4FMs, an open evaluation platform with plug-and-play interfaces that integrates 15 representative BFMs and 18 public datasets.

While recent studies have exploited behavior-related prompts adjustment to enhance reasoning, these designs remain largely intuitive and lack a systematic analysis of the underlying behavioral patterns. Motivated by this, we investigate how models' reasoning behaviors shape reasoning from the perspective of behavioral patterns. We observe that models exhibit adaptive distributions of reasoning behaviors when responding to specific types of questions, and that structurally injecting these patterns can substantially influence the quality of the models' reasoning processes and outcomes. Building on these findings, we propose two optimization methods that require no parameter updates: InjectCorrect and InjectRLOpt. InjectCorrect guides the model by imitating behavioral patterns derived from its own past correct answers. InjectRLOpt learns a value function from historical behavior-pattern data and, via our proposed Reliability-Aware Softmax Policy, generates behavioral injectant during inference to steer the reasoning process. Our experiments demonstrate that both methods can improve model performance across various reasoning tasks without requiring any modifications to model parameters, achieving gains of up to 5.34% and 8.67%, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Nonetheless, the direct application of SAM in FL suffers from inaccurate estimation of the global perturbation due to data heterogeneity. Existing approaches propose to utilize the model update from the previous communication round as a rough estimate. However, its effectiveness is hindered when model update compression is incorporated. In this paper, we propose FedSynSAM, which leverages the global model trajectory to construct synthetic data and facilitates an accurate estimation of the global perturbation. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is established, and extensive experiments are conducted to validate its effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although deep learning models have demonstrated significant accuracy, they frequently suffer from miscalibration, manifested as overconfidence in erroneous predictions. To facilitate clinical acceptance, it is imperative that models quantify uncertainty in a manner that correlates with prediction correctness, allowing clinicians to identify unreliable outputs for further review. In order to address this necessity, the present paper proposes a generalizable probabilistic optimization framework grounded in Bayesian deep learning. Specifically, a novel Confidence-Uncertainty Boundary Loss (CUB-Loss) is introduced that imposes penalties on high-certainty errors and low-certainty correct predictions, explicitly enforcing alignment between prediction correctness and uncertainty estimates. Complementing this training-time optimization, a Dual Temperature Scaling (DTS) strategy is devised for post-hoc calibration, further refining the posterior distribution to improve intuitive explainability. The proposed framework is validated on three distinct medical imaging tasks: automatic screening of pneumonia, diabetic retinopathy detection, and identification of skin lesions. Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves consistent calibration improvements across diverse modalities, maintains robust performance in data-scarce scenarios, and remains effective on severely imbalanced datasets, underscoring its potential for real clinical deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

SFIPP-ST handles heterogeneous UAVs, strictly enforces temporal NFZs, and models inter-agent conflicts as soft constraints. Subsequently, an iterative Large Neighborhood Search, guided by a geometric conflict graph, efficiently resolves any residual conflicts. A completeness-preserving directional pruning technique further accelerates the 3D search. On benchmarks with temporal NFZs, DTAPP-IICR achieves near-100% success with fleets of up to 1,000 UAVs and gains up to 50% runtime reduction from pruning, outperforming batch Enhanced Conflict-Based Search in the UTM context.

Quality is better understood as multidimensional, with each dimension corresponding to a capability the model must acquire. We introduce SkillRater, a framework that decomposes data filtering into specialized raters - one per capability, each trained via meta-learning on a disjoint validation objective - and composes their scores through a progressive selection rule: at each training stage, a sample is retained if any rater ranks it above a threshold that tightens over time, preserving diversity early while concentrating on high-value samples late. We validate this approach on vision language models, decomposing quality into three capability dimensions: visual understanding, OCR, and STEM reasoning. At 2B parameters, SkillRater improves over unfiltered baselines by 5.63% on visual understanding, 2.00% on OCR, and 3.53% on STEM on held out benchmarks.

In this work, we evaluate this assumption by pretraining CLMs while scaling training resources and measuring transfer performance across diverse molecular property prediction (MPP) tasks. We find that while pretraining loss consistently decreases with increased training resources, downstream task performance shows limited improvement. Moreover, alternative metrics based on the Hessian or loss landscape also fail to estimate downstream performance in CLMs. We further identify conditions under which downstream performance saturates or degrades despite continued improvements in pretraining metrics, and analyze the underlying task dependent failure modes through parameter space visualizations.

They remain like a Dumbledore without agency, passively accepting a manually engineered context as their entire memory. This work finally places the wand in the model's hand. We introduce StateLM, a new class of foundation models endowed with an internal reasoning loop to manage their own state. We equip our model with a suite of memory tools, such as context pruning, document indexing, and note-taking, and train it to actively manage these tools.

In many-query regimes such as design optimization, control and inverse problems, surrogate modeling must generalize across geometries while allowing flexible evaluation at arbitrary spatial locations. In this work, we propose Arbitrary Geometry-encoded Transformer (ArGEnT), a geometry-aware attention-based architecture for operator learning on arbitrary domains. ArGEnT employs Transformer attention mechanisms to encode geometric information directly from point-cloud representations with three variants-self-attention, cross-attention, and hybrid-attention-that incorporates different strategies for incorporating geometric features. By integrating ArGEnT into DeepONet as the trunk network, we develop a surrogate modeling framework capable of learning operator mappings that depend on both geometric and non-geometric inputs without the need to explicitly parametrize geometry as a branch network input. Evaluation on benchmark problems spanning fluid dynamics, solid mechanics and electrochemical systems, we demonstrate significantly improved prediction accuracy and generalization performance compared with the standard DeepONet and other existing geometry-aware saurrogates. In particular, the cross-attention transformer variant enables accurate geometry-conditioned predictions with reduced reliance on signed distance functions. By combining flexible geometry encoding with operator-learning capabilities, ArGEnT provides a scalable surrogate modeling framework for optimization, uncertainty quantification, and data-driven modeling of complex physical systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, they often generate over-long chains-of-thought that, driven by substantial reflections such as repetitive self-questioning and circular reasoning, lead to high token consumption, substantial computational overhead, and increased latency without improving accuracy, particularly in smaller models. Our observation reveals that increasing problem complexity induces more excessive and unnecessary reflection, which in turn reduces accuracy and increases token overhead. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Reflection and Length Coordinated Penalty (ARLCP), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to dynamically balance reasoning efficiency and solution accuracy. ARLCP introduces two key innovations: (1) a reflection penalty that adaptively curtails unnecessary reflective steps while preserving essential reasoning, and (2) a length penalty calibrated to the estimated complexity of the problem. By coordinating these penalties, ARLCP encourages the model to generate more concise and effective reasoning paths. We evaluate our method on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B models. Experimental results show that ARLCP achieves a superior efficiency-accuracy trade-off compared to existing approaches. For the 1.5B model, it reduces the average response length by 53.1% while simultaneously improving accuracy by 5.8%. For the 7B model, it achieves a 35.0% reduction in length with a 2.7% accuracy gain.

Recently, the focus of GPL has shifted from in-domain to cross-domain scenarios, which is closer to the real world applications, where the pre-training source and downstream target often differ substantially in data distribution. However, why GPLs remain effective under such domain shifts is still unexplored. Empirically, we observe that representative GPL methods are competitive with two simple baselines in cross-domain settings: full fine-tuning (FT) and linear probing (LP), motivating us to explore a deeper understanding of the prompting mechanism. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that jointly leveraging these two complementary branches yields a smaller estimation error than using either branch alone, formally proving that cross-domain GPL benefits from the integration between pre-trained knowledge and task-specific adaptation. Based on this insight, we propose GP2F, a dual-branch GPL method that explicitly instantiates the two extremes: (1) a frozen branch that retains pre-trained knowledge, and (2) an adapted branch with lightweight adapters for task-specific adaptation.

Recently, TSFMs have provided zero-shot priors, delivering strong gains in annual, data-sparse institutional forecasting under leakage-disciplined covariate construction. We benchmark multiple TSFM families in a zero-shot setting and test a compact, leakage-safe covariate set and introduce the Institutional Operating Conditions Index (IOCI), a transferable 0-100 regime covariate derived from time-stamped documentary evidence available at each forecast origin, alongside Google Trends demand proxies with stabilising feature engineering.

Existing defenses, such as Differential Privacy (DP), typically employ indiscriminate noise injection across all parameters, which severely degrades model utility and convergence stability. To address those limitation, we proposes Targeted Interpretable Perturbation (TIP), a novel defense framework that integrates model interpretability with frequency domain analysis. Unlike conventional methods that treat parameters uniformly, TIP introduces a dual-targeting strategy. First, leveraging Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to quantify channel sensitivity, we dynamically identify critical convolution channels that encode primary semantic features. Second, we transform these selected kernels into the frequency domain via the Discrete Fourier Transform and selectively inject calibrated perturbations into the high-frequency spectrum. By selectively perturbing high-frequency components, TIP effectively destroys the fine-grained details necessary for image reconstruction while preserving the low-frequency information crucial for model accuracy. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TIP renders reconstructed images visually unrecognizable against state-of-the-art GIAs, while maintaining global model accuracy comparable to non-private baselines, significantly outperforming existing DP-based defenses in the privacy-utility trade-off and interpretability.

Models must generate text, layout, style, and visual elements while preserving semantic fidelity and aesthetic coherence. The process spans two regimes: local editing, where ID-driven generation, rescaling, filling, and extending must preserve concrete visual entities; and global creation, where layout- and style-driven tasks rely on understanding abstract design concepts. These intertwined demands make image-to-poster a multi-dimensional process coupling entity-preserving editing with concept-driven creation under image-prompt control. To address these challenges, we propose PosterOmni, a generalized artistic poster creation framework that unlocks the potential of a base edit model for multi-task image-to-poster generation. PosterOmni integrates the two regimes, namely local editing and global creation, within a single system through an efficient data-distillation-reward pipeline: (i) constructing multi-scenario image-to-poster datasets covering six task types across entity-based and concept-based creation; (ii) distilling knowledge between local and global experts for supervised fine-tuning; and (iii) applying unified PosterOmni Reward Feedback to jointly align visual entity-preserving and aesthetic preference across all tasks. Additionally, we establish PosterOmni-Bench, a unified benchmark for evaluating both local editing and global creation. Extensive experiments show that PosterOmni significantly enhances reference adherence, global composition quality, and aesthetic harmony, outperforming all open-source baselines and even surpassing several proprietary systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

It will be shown that the proposed nonlinearity amounts to a higher-degree rational function to approximate softmax. An efficient computational scheme for the proposed method is derived that is similar to that of standard linear attention.

While effective on in-distribution (ID) data, GNNs often encounter out-of-distribution (OOD) nodes with unseen textual or structural patterns in real-world settings, leading to overconfident and erroneous predictions in the absence of reliable OOD detection. Early approaches address this issue from a topology-driven perspective, leveraging neighboring structures to mitigate node-level detection bias. However, these methods typically encode node texts as shallow vector features, failing to fully exploit rich semantic information. In contrast, recent LLM-based approaches generate pseudo OOD priors by leveraging textual knowledge, but they suffer from several limitations: (1) a reliability-informativeness imbalance in the synthesized OOD priors, as the generated OOD exposures either deviate from the true OOD semantics, or introduce non-negligible ID noise, all of which offers limited improvement to detection performance; (2) reliance on specialized architectures, which prevents incorporation of the extensive effective topology-level insights that have been empirically validated in prior work. To this end, we propose LG-Plug, an LLM-Guided Plug-and-play strategy for TAG OOD detection tasks. LG-Plug aligns topology and text representations to produce fine-grained node embeddings, then generates consensus-driven OOD exposure via clustered iterative LLM prompting. Moreover, it leverages lightweight in-cluster codebook and heuristic sampling reduce time cost of LLM querying. The resulting OOD exposure serves as a regularization term to separate ID and OOD nodes, enabling seamless integration with existing detectors.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The analysis employed a rigorous pipeline combining hybrid color normalization, facial landmark masking, and perceptually uniform skin tone quantification using the Monk (MST), PERLA, and Fitzpatrick scales. Neutral prompts produced highly polarized defaults. Both models exhibited a strong \"default white\" bias (>96% of outputs). However, they diverged sharply on gender: Gemini favored female-presenting subjects, while GPT favored male-presenting subjects with lighter skin tones. This research provides a large-scale, comparative audit of state-of-the-art models using an illumination-aware colorimetric methodology, distinguishing aesthetic rendering from underlying pigmentation in synthetic imagery.

Existing representations either rely on UV maps, which suffer from distortion during unwrapping, or point-based methods, which tightly couple texture fidelity to geometric density that limits high-resolution texture generation. To address these limitations, we introduce TexSpot, a diffusion-based texture enhancement framework. At its core is Texlet, a novel 3D texture representation that merges the geometric expressiveness of point-based 3D textures with the compactness of UV-based representation. Each Texlet latent vector encodes a local texture patch via a 2D encoder and is further aggregated using a 3D encoder to incorporate global shape context. A cascaded 3D-to-2D decoder reconstructs high-quality texture patches, enabling the Texlet space learning. Leveraging this representation, we train a diffusion transformer conditioned on Texlets to refine and enhance textures produced by multi-view diffusion methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TexSpot significantly improves visual fidelity, geometric consistency, and robustness over existing state-of-the-art 3D texture generation and enhancement approaches.

Existing OBO algorithms are mainly based on hypergradient descent, which requires access to a Hessian-vector product (HVP) oracle and potentially incurs high computational costs. By reformulating the original OBO problem as a single-level online problem with inequality constraints and constructing a sequence of Lagrangian function, we eliminate the need for HVPs arising from implicit differentiation. Specifically, we propose a fully first-order algorithm for OBO, and provide theoretical guarantees showing that it achieves regret of $O(1 + V_T + H_{2,T})$. Furthermore, we develop an improved variant with an adaptive inner-iteration scheme, which removes the dependence on the drift variation of the inner-level optimal solution and achieves regret of $O(\\sqrt{T} + V_T)$. This regret have the advatange when $V_{T}\\ge O(\\sqrt{T})$.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing approaches typically treat human-centric tasks including reference-based audio-video generation (R2AV), video editing (RV2AV) and audio-driven video animation (RA2V) as isolated objectives. Furthermore, achieving precise, disentangled control over multiple character identities and voice timbres within a single framework remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose DreamID-Omni, a unified framework for controllable human-centric audio-video generation. Specifically, we design a Symmetric Conditional Diffusion Transformer that integrates heterogeneous conditioning signals via a symmetric conditional injection scheme. To resolve the pervasive identity-timbre binding failures and speaker confusion in multi-person scenarios, we introduce a Dual-Level Disentanglement strategy: Synchronized RoPE at the signal level to ensure rigid attention-space binding, and Structured Captions at the semantic level to establish explicit attribute-subject mappings. Furthermore, we devise a Multi-Task Progressive Training scheme that leverages weakly-constrained generative priors to regularize strongly-constrained tasks, preventing overfitting and harmonizing disparate objectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamID-Omni achieves comprehensive state-of-the-art performance across video, audio, and audio-visual consistency, even outperforming leading proprietary commercial models.

We analyze a public dataset of 839 treadmill recordings from healthy and injured runners to evaluate how effectively these systems capture dynamic parameters relevant to injury classification. The focus is on the stance phase, using joint and segment angle time series and discrete point values.\n  Three classification tasks are addressed: healthy vs. injured, healthy vs. PFPS, and healthy vs. ITBS. We examine different feature spaces, from traditional point-based metrics to full stance-phase time series and hybrid representations. Multiple models are tested, including classical algorithms (K-Nearest Neighbors, Gaussian Processes, Decision Trees) and deep learning architectures (CNNs, LSTMs).\n  Performance is evaluated with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Explainability tools such as Shapley values, saliency maps, and Grad-CAM are used to interpret model behavior. Results show that combining time series with point values substantially improves detection. Deep learning models outperform classical ones, with CNNs achieving the highest accuracy: 77.9% for PFPS, 73.8% for ITBS, and 71.43% for the combined injury class.\n  These findings highlight the potential of motion capture systems coupled with advanced machine learning to identify knee injury-related running patterns.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we present DeepGen 1.0, a lightweight 5B unified model that achieves comprehensive capabilities competitive with or surpassing much larger counterparts. To overcome the limitations of compact models in semantic understanding and fine-grained control, we introduce Stacked Channel Bridging (SCB), a deep alignment framework that extracts hierarchical features from multiple VLM layers and fuses them with learnable 'think tokens' to provide the generative backbone with structured, reasoning-rich guidance. We further design a data-centric training strategy spanning three progressive stages: (1) Alignment Pre-training on large-scale image-text pairs and editing triplets to synchronize VLM and DiT representations, (2) Joint Supervised Fine-tuning on a high-quality mixture of generation, editing, and reasoning tasks to foster omni-capabilities, and (3) Reinforcement Learning with MR-GRPO, which leverages a mixture of reward functions and supervision signals, resulting in substantial gains in generation quality and alignment with human preferences, while maintaining stable training progress and avoiding visual artifacts. Despite being trained on only ~50M samples, DeepGen 1.0 achieves leading performance across diverse benchmarks, surpassing the 80B HunyuanImage by 28% on WISE and the 27B Qwen-Image-Edit by 37% on UniREditBench.

Research into this question has focused on evaluating LLMs against benchmarks and found success across a range of social tasks. However, these evaluations do not test for the actual representations posited by ToM: namely, a causal model of mental states and behavior. Here, we use a cognitively-grounded definition of ToM to develop and test a new evaluation framework. Specifically, our approach probes whether LLMs have a coherent, domain-general, and consistent model of how mental states cause behavior -- regardless of whether that model matches a human-like ToM. We find that even though LLMs succeed in approximating human judgments in a simple ToM paradigm, they fail at a logically equivalent task and exhibit low consistency between their action predictions and corresponding mental state inferences. As such, these findings suggest that the social proficiency exhibited by LLMs is not the result of an domain-general or consistent ToM.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u5bf9\u5fc3\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u62e5\u6709\u56e0\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u9886\u57df\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u867d\u7136LLM\u80fd\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u7b49\u4ef7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u4e14\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u793e\u4ea4\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u672a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5fc3\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u6240\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u8868\u5f81\u2014\u2014\u5373\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u4e0e\u884c\u4e3a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u7528\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u5b9a\u4e49\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u771f\u6b63\u68c0\u9a8cLLM\u662f\u5426\u5177\u6709\u9886\u57df\u901a\u7528\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5fc3\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u6d4b\u8bd5LLM\u662f\u5426\u62e5\u6709\u56e0\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u3001\u9886\u57df\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5305\u62ec\u7b80\u5355\u5fc3\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u8303\u5f0f\u4efb\u52a1\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u7b49\u4ef7\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09LLM\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u5fc3\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u80fd\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4eba\u7c7b\u5224\u65ad\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u903b\u8f91\u7b49\u4ef7\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5931\u8d25\uff1b3\uff09\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u76f8\u5e94\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4e4b\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5f88\u4f4e\u3002\u8868\u660e\u663e\u8457\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u4ee3\u8868\u62e5\u6709\u9886\u57df\u901a\u7528\u6216\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u793e\u4ea4\u719f\u7ec3\u5ea6\u5e76\u975e\u6765\u81ea\u9886\u57df\u901a\u7528\u6216\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u3002\u867d\u7136LLM\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u80fd\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4f1a\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u6b63\u56e0\u679c\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5fc3\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8fd9\u5bf9\u7406\u89e3LLM\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba4\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5fc3\u7406\u7406\u8bba\u80fd\u529b\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

By combining what the model observes (gradient signals) with what the system knows about data provenance (external signals), ANML produces per-contributor quality weights that simultaneously improve model performance and enable downstream attribution.

Quality-weighted training is data-efficient: 20% high-quality data outperforms 100% uniformly weighted data by 47%. A Two-Stage Adaptive gating mechanism guarantees that ANML never underperforms the best available baseline, including under strategic joint attacks combining credential faking with gradient alignment.

In this paper, we propose SpiralFormer, a looped Transformer that executes recurrence under a multi-resolution recursion schedule. We provide probing evidence that multi-resolution recursion enables the model to learn hierarchical dependencies by inducing iteration-wise functional specialization across different scales. Empirically, SpiralFormer achieves better parameter and compute efficiency than both looped and non-looped baselines across model scales from 160M to 1.4B, establishing sequence resolution as a potential axis for scaling recursive architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "SpiralFormer\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5faa\u73afTransformer\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9012\u5f52\u8c03\u5ea6\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u4e0a\u6267\u884c\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5faa\u73afTransformer\u867d\u7136\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u5c42\u89e3\u8026\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u53c2\u6570\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ec6\u5316\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u539f\u8bed\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u5b8c\u6574token\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002\u65e9\u671f\u5faa\u73afTransformer\u5f80\u5f80\u5728\u540c\u7b49\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u5982\u975e\u5faa\u73af\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSpiralFormer\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9012\u5f52\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e0b\u6267\u884c\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u5faa\u73afTransformer\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fed\u4ee3\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bf1\u5bfc\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u5c42\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4ece1.6\u4ebf\u523014\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\uff0cSpiralFormer\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u5faa\u73af\u548c\u975e\u5faa\u73af\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6269\u5c55\u9012\u5f52\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "SpiralFormer\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9012\u5f52\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5faa\u73afTransformer\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u8868\u793a\u4e0a\u6267\u884c\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u9012\u5f52\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u2014\u2014\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002"}}

In this setting, we find that prior sparse-attention approximations break down, despite showing strong results for bidirectional, many-step diffusion. Specifically, we observe that video attention is not reliably sparse, but instead combines pronounced periodic structure driven by spatiotemporal position with dynamic, sparse semantic correspondences and dense mixing, exceeding the representational capacity of even oracle top-k attention. Building on this insight, we propose Monarch-RT, a structured attention parameterization for video diffusion models that factorizes attention using Monarch matrices. Through appropriately aligned block structure and our extended tiled Monarch parameterization, we achieve high expressivity while preserving computational efficiency. We further overcome the overhead of parameterization through finetuning, with custom Triton kernels. We first validate the high efficacy of Monarch-RT over existing sparse baselines designed only for bidirectional models. We further observe that Monarch-RT attains up to 95% attention sparsity with no loss in quality when applied to the state-of-the-art model Self-Forcing, making Monarch-RT a pioneering work on highly-capable sparse attention parameterization for real-time video generation. Our optimized implementation outperforms FlashAttention-2, FlashAttention-3, and FlashAttention-4 kernels on Nvidia RTX 5090, H100, and B200 GPUs respectively, providing kernel speedups in the range of 1.4-11.8X.

Models do not consistently leverage relevant rows, and noisy context can degrade performance. To address this challenge, we propose TabSieve, a select-then-predict framework that makes evidence usage explicit and auditable. Given a table and a query row, TabSieve first selects a small set of informative rows as evidence and then predicts the missing target conditioned on the selected evidence. To enable this capability, we construct TabSieve-SFT-40K by synthesizing high-quality reasoning trajectories from 331 real tables using a strong teacher model with strict filtering. Furthermore, we introduce TAB-GRPO, a reinforcement learning recipe that jointly optimizes evidence selection and prediction correctness with separate rewards, and stabilizes mixed regression and classification training via dynamic task-advantage balancing. Experiments on a held-out benchmark of 75 classification and 52 regression tables show that TabSieve consistently improves performance across shot budgets, with average gains of 2.92% on classification and 4.45% on regression over the second-best baseline.

However, current methods for distillation via synthetic data lack pedagogical awareness, treating knowledge transfer as a one-off data synthesis and training task rather than a systematic learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel pedagogically-inspired framework for LLM knowledge distillation that draws from fundamental educational principles. Our approach introduces a three-stage pipeline -- Knowledge Identifier, Organizer, and Adapter (IOA) -- that systematically identifies knowledge deficiencies in student models, organizes knowledge delivery through progressive curricula, and adapts representations to match the cognitive capacity of student models. We integrate Bloom's Mastery Learning Principles and Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal Development to create a dynamic distillation process where student models approach teacher model's performance on prerequisite knowledge before advancing, and new knowledge is introduced with controlled, gradual difficulty increments. Extensive experiments using LLaMA-3.1/3.2 and Qwen2.5 as student models demonstrate that IOA achieves significant improvements over baseline distillation methods, with student models retaining 94.7% of teacher performance on DollyEval while using less than 1/10th of the parameters.

The observation noise covariance of a Bayesian filter is modulated by the local value of a known or assumed potential energy function: observations are trusted when the state is near a potential minimum and progressively discounted as it approaches the barrier separating metastable wells. This physics-based mechanism differs from purely statistical robust filters, which treat all regions of state space identically, and from constrained filters, which impose hard bounds on states rather than modulating observation trust. We implement the gating within Extended, Unscented, Ensemble, and Adaptive Kalman filters and particle filters, requiring only two additional hyperparameters. Synthetic benchmarks on a Ginzburg-Landau double-well process with 10% outlier contamination and Monte Carlo validation over 100 replications show 57-80% RMSE improvement over the standard Extended Kalman Filter, all statistically significant (p < 10^{-15}, Wilcoxon signed-rank test). A naive topological baseline using only distance to the nearest well achieves 57%, confirming that the continuous energy landscape adds an additional ~21 percentage points. The method is robust to misspecification: even when assumed potential parameters deviate by 50% from their true values, improvement never falls below 47%. Comparing externally forced and spontaneous Kramers-type transitions, gating retains 68% improvement under noise-induced transitions whereas the naive baseline degrades to 30%. As an empirical illustration, we apply the framework to Dansgaard-Oeschger events in the NGRIP delta-18O ice-core record, estimating asymmetry parameter gamma = -0.109 (bootstrap 95% CI: [-0.220, -0.011], excluding zero) and demonstrating that outlier fraction explains 91% of the variance in filter improvement.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u52bf\u80fd\u95e8\u63a7\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53cc\u9631\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5df2\u77e5\u52bf\u80fd\u51fd\u6570\u8c03\u5236\u89c2\u6d4b\u566a\u58f0\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5728\u52bf\u9631\u9644\u8fd1\u4fe1\u4efb\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u52bf\u5792\u5904\u964d\u4f4e\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9c81\u68d2\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u57df\u4e00\u89c6\u540c\u4ec1\uff0c\u7ea6\u675f\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u5219\u91c7\u7528\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\uff08\u52bf\u80fd\u666f\u89c2\uff09\u6765\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u8282\u89c2\u6d4b\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\u7684\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b58\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u65f6\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u52bf\u80fd\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u6269\u5c55\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u3001\u65e0\u8ff9\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u3001\u96c6\u5408\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u548c\u7c92\u5b50\u6ee4\u6ce2\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u4e24\u4e2a\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u89c2\u6d4b\u566a\u58f0\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u6839\u636e\u5c40\u90e8\u52bf\u80fd\u503c\u8c03\u6574\uff1a\u52bf\u9631\u9644\u8fd1\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u5c0f\uff08\u4fe1\u4efb\u9ad8\uff09\uff0c\u52bf\u5792\u9644\u8fd1\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u5927\uff08\u4fe1\u4efb\u4f4e\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u53cc\u9631Ginzburg-Landau\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff08\u542b10%\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff09\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6\u6269\u5c55\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\uff0cRMSE\u6539\u558457-80%\uff08p<10^{-15}\uff09\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u52bf\u80fd\u53c2\u6570\u8bef\u8bbe50%\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u4ecd\u4fdd\u630147%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eNGRIP\u51b0\u82af\u03b4\u00b9\u2078O\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684Dansgaard-Oeschger\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u53c2\u6570\u03b3=-0.109\uff0c\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u6bd4\u4f8b\u89e3\u91ca\u4e8691%\u7684\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u52bf\u80fd\u95e8\u63a7\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u8c03\u8282\u89c2\u6d4b\u4fe1\u4efb\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u53cc\u9631\u968f\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u65f6\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e14\u5bf9\u52bf\u80fd\u8bef\u8bbe\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u7edf\u8ba1\u9c81\u68d2\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u548c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce Progressive Semantic Illusions, a novel vector sketching task where a single sketch undergoes a dramatic semantic transformation through the sequential addition of strokes. We present Stroke of Surprise, a generative framework that optimizes vector strokes to satisfy distinct semantic interpretations at different drawing stages. The core challenge lies in the \"dual-constraint\": initial prefix strokes must form a coherent object (e.g., a duck) while simultaneously serving as the structural foundation for a second concept (e.g., a sheep) upon adding delta strokes. To address this, we propose a sequence-aware joint optimization framework driven by a dual-branch Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) mechanism. Unlike sequential approaches that freeze the initial state, our method dynamically adjusts prefix strokes to discover a \"common structural subspace\" valid for both targets. Furthermore, we introduce a novel Overlay Loss that enforces spatial complementarity, ensuring structural integration rather than occlusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in recognizability and illusion strength, successfully expanding visual anagrams from the spatial to the temporal dimension.

In practice, segmentation prompts are short, structured, and semantically constrained, leading to substantial over-provisioning in text encoder capacity and persistent computational and memory overhead. In this paper, we perform a large-scale anatomical analysis of text prompting in vision-language segmentation, covering 404,796 real prompts across multiple benchmarks. Our analysis reveals severe redundancy: most context windows are underutilized, vocabulary usage is highly sparse, and text embeddings lie on low-dimensional manifold despite high-dimensional representations. Motivated by these findings, we propose SAM3-LiteText, a lightweight text encoding framework that replaces the original SAM3 text encoder with a compact MobileCLIP student that is optimized by knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments on image and video segmentation benchmarks show that SAM3-LiteText reduces text encoder parameters by up to 88%, substantially reducing static memory footprint, while maintaining segmentation performance comparable to the original model.

This paradigm is particularly well-suited for code generation, where holistic structural planning and non-sequential refinement are critical. Despite this potential, tailoring dLLMs for CUDA kernel generation remains challenging, obstructed not only by the high specialization but also by the severe lack of high-quality training data. To address these challenges, we construct CuKe, an augmented supervised fine-tuning dataset optimized for high-performance CUDA kernels. On top of it, we propose a bi-phase curated reinforcement learning (BiC-RL) framework consisting of a CUDA kernel infilling stage and an end-to-end CUDA kernel generation stage. Leveraging this training framework, we introduce DICE, a series of diffusion large language models designed for CUDA kernel generation, spanning three parameter scales, 1.7B, 4B, and 8B.

Here, we study this failure mode in a high-stakes task: the transcription of U.S. street names as spoken by U.S. participants. We evaluate 15 models from OpenAI, Deepgram, Google, and Microsoft on recordings from linguistically diverse U.S. speakers and find an average transcription error rate of 44%. We quantify the downstream impact of failed transcriptions by geographic locations and show that mis-transcriptions systematically cause errors for all speakers, but that routing distance errors are twice as large for non-English primary speakers compared to English primary speakers. To mitigate this harm, we introduce a synthetic data generation approach that produces diverse pronunciations of named entities using open-source text-to-speech models. Fine-tuning with less than 1,000 synthetic samples improves street name transcription accuracy by nearly 60% (relative to base models) for non-English primary speakers. Our results highlight a critical gap between benchmark performance and real-world reliability in speech systems and demonstrate a simple, scalable path to reducing high-stakes transcription errors.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We explore an alternative view inspired by neuromodulation: adaptation as a change in \\emph{mode} -- selecting and rescaling existing computations -- rather than rewriting the underlying weights. We propose \\methodname{}, a simple activation-space PEFT technique that freezes base weights and learns per-neuron \\emph{thresholds} and \\emph{gains}.

We pretrain a small MLP on a 50/50 mixture (foundation), freeze its weights, and then specialize to the rotated mode using \\methodname{}. Across seeds, \\methodname{} improves rotated accuracy over the frozen baseline while using only a few hundred trainable parameters per layer, and exhibits partial activation sparsity (a minority of units strongly active).

Extensive experiments on five standard benchmarks -- covering both regularly and irregularly sampled time series -- demonstrate that UFO consistently outperforms ten state-of-the-art neural baselines in predictive accuracy.

Choosing suitable thresholds relies on the specific distribution of the underlying model scores but also on the specific business decisions of each client using that model. However, retraining models inevitably shifts score distributions, invalidating existing thresholds. In multi-tenant Score-as-a-Service environments, where decision boundaries reside in client-managed infrastructure, this creates a severe bottleneck: recalibration requires coordinating threshold updates across hundreds of clients, consuming excessive human hours and leading to model stagnation. We introduce MUSE, a model serving framework that enables seamless model updates by decoupling model scores from client decision boundaries. Designed for multi-tenancy, MUSE optimizes infrastructure re-use by sharing models via dynamic intent-based routing, combined with a two-level score transformation that maps model outputs to a stable, reference distribution. Deployed at scale by Feedzai, MUSE processes over a thousand events per second, and over 55 billion events in the last 12 months, across several dozens of tenants, while maintaining high-availability and low-latency guarantees. By reducing model lead time from weeks to minutes, MUSE promotes model resilience against shifting attacks, saving millions of dollars in fraud losses and operational costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "MUSE \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u670d\u52a1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6570\u4e0e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u79df\u6237 Score-as-a-Service \u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u9608\u503c\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u80fd\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7ebf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u8282\u7701\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5206\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u9608\u503c\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6570\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u884c\u52a8\u3002\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u7684\u9608\u503c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5e95\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6570\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u8fd8\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u4e1a\u52a1\u51b3\u7b56\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u5730\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\u5206\u6570\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f7f\u73b0\u6709\u9608\u503c\u5931\u6548\u3002\u5728\u591a\u79df\u6237 Score-as-a-Service \u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u4f4d\u4e8e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u9020\u6210\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff1a\u91cd\u65b0\u6821\u51c6\u9700\u8981\u534f\u8c03\u6570\u767e\u4e2a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u66f4\u65b0\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u529b\u65f6\u95f4\u5e76\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u505c\u6ede\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86 MUSE\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u670d\u52a1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6570\u4e0e\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u89e3\u8026\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u7f1d\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e13\u4e3a\u591a\u79df\u6237\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u8def\u7531\u5171\u4eab\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u590d\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u7ea7\u5206\u6570\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "MUSE \u5728 Feedzai \u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u6bcf\u79d2\u5904\u7406\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e00\u5343\u4e2a\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u5728\u8fc7\u53bb12\u4e2a\u6708\u5185\u5904\u7406\u4e86\u8d85\u8fc7550\u4ebf\u4e2a\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u8de8\u6570\u5341\u4e2a\u79df\u6237\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7ebf\u65f6\u95f4\u4ece\u51e0\u5468\u7f29\u77ed\u5230\u51e0\u5206\u949f\uff0cMUSE \u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u53d8\u5316\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u8282\u7701\u4e86\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\u7684\u6b3a\u8bc8\u635f\u5931\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u6210\u672c\u3002"}}

High temperatures encourage diverse but noisy outputs, while low temperatures produce focused outputs but may cause premature convergence. Yet static or heuristic temperature schedules fail to adapt to the dynamic demands of reinforcement learning (RL) throughout training, often limiting policy improvement. We propose Temperature Adaptive Meta Policy Optimization (TAMPO), a new framework that recasts temperature control as a learnable meta-policy. TAMPO operates through a hierarchical two-loop process. In the inner loop, the LLM policy is updated (e.g., using GRPO) with trajectories sampled at the temperature selected by the meta-policy. In the outer loop, meta-policy updates the distribution over candidate temperatures by rewarding those that maximize the likelihood of high-advantage trajectories.

In the light of this issue, many methods have been proposed to enhance the fairness guarantees of classifiers. Most of the existing interventions assume access to group information for all instances, a requirement rarely met in practice. Fairness without access to demographic information has often been approached through robust optimization techniques,which target worst-case outcomes over a set of plausible distributions known as the uncertainty set. However, their effectiveness is strongly influenced by the chosen uncertainty set. In fact, existing approaches often overemphasize outliers or overly pessimistic scenarios, compromising both overall performance and fairness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SPECTRE, a minimax-fair method that adjusts the spectrum of a simple Fourier feature mapping and constrains the extent to which the worst-case distribution can deviate from the empirical distribution. We perform extensive experiments on the American Community Survey datasets involving 20 states. The safeness of SPECTRE comes as it provides the highest average values on fairness guarantees together with the smallest interquartile range in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches, even compared to those with access to demographic group information. In addition, we provide a theoretical analysis that derives computable bounds on the worst-case error for both individual groups and the overall population, as well as characterizes the worst-case distributions responsible for these extremal performances", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We study whether low-bit planning behavior is determined mostly by total bitwidth or by where bits are allocated across modules. Using DINO-WM on the Wall planning task, we run a paired-goal mixed-bit evaluation across uniform, mixed, asymmetric, and layerwise variants under two planner budgets. We observe a consistent three-regime pattern: 8-bit and 6-bit settings remain close to FP16, 3-bit settings collapse, and 4-bit settings are allocation-sensitive. In that transition region, preserving encoder precision improves planning relative to uniform quantization, and near-size asymmetric variants show the same encoder-side direction. In a later strict 22-cell replication with smaller per-cell episode count, the mixed-versus-uniform INT4 sign becomes budget-conditioned, which further highlights the sensitivity of this transition regime.

However, real-world deployment exposes a different class of risk: operational failures arising from repeated inference on identical or near-identical prompts rather than broad task generalization. In high-stakes settings, response consistency and safety under sustained use are critical. We introduce Accelerated Prompt Stress Testing (APST), a depth-oriented evaluation framework inspired by reliability engineering. APST repeatedly samples identical prompts under controlled operational conditions (e.g., decoding temperature) to surface latent failure modes including hallucinations, refusal inconsistency, and unsafe completions. Rather than treating failures as isolated events, APST models them as stochastic outcomes of independent inference events. We formalize safety failures using Bernoulli and binomial models to estimate per-inference failure probabilities, enabling quantitative comparison of reliability across models and decoding configurations. Applying APST to multiple instruction-tuned LLMs evaluated on AIR-BENCH-derived safety prompts, we find that models with similar benchmark-aligned scores can exhibit substantially different empirical failure rates under repeated sampling, particularly as temperature increases. These results demonstrate that shallow, single-sample evaluation can obscure meaningful reliability differences under sustained use. APST complements existing benchmarks by providing a practical framework for evaluating LLM safety and reliability under repeated inference, bridging benchmark alignment and deployment-oriented risk assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our approach combines a spectral Galerkin projection with a truncated Wiener chaos expansion, yielding a principled separation between deterministic evolution and stochastic forcing. This reduces the infinite-dimensional SPDE to a finite system of parametrized ordinary differential equations governing latent temporal dynamics.

Leveraging DDT, we introduce two complementary techniques: (i) \\textbf{\\textit{In-Distribution Finetuning (IDFT)}}, a loss-level method to enhance generalization ability of SFT, and (ii) \\textbf{\\textit{Hinted Decoding}}, a data-level technique that can re-align the training corpus to the model's distribution.

The proposed framework thus offers a practical alternative in domains where RL is infeasible.

Ensuring fairness in this task is thus essential. While many fairness-aware methods manipulate graph structures to mitigate prediction disparities, the topological biases inherent to social graph structures remain poorly understood and are often reduced to homophily alone. This undermines the generalization potential of fairness interventions and limits their applicability across diverse network topologies. In this work, we propose a novel benchmarking framework for fair LP, centered on the structural biases of the underlying graphs. We begin by reviewing and formalizing a broad taxonomy of topological bias measures relevant to fairness in graphs. In parallel, we introduce a flexible graph generation method that simultaneously ensures fidelity to real-world graph patterns and enables controlled variation across a wide spectrum of structural biases. We apply this framework to evaluate both classical and fairness-aware LP models across multiple use cases. Our results provide a fine-grained empirical analysis of the interactions between predictive fairness and structural biases. This new perspective reveals the sensitivity of fairness interventions to beyond-homophily biases and underscores the need for structurally grounded fairness evaluations in graph learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We propose the Incremental Signature Contribution (ISC) method, which decomposes truncated path signatures into a temporally ordered sequence of elements in the tensor-algebra space, corresponding to incremental contributions induced by last path increments. This reconstruction preserves the algebraic structure and expressivity of signatures, while making their internal temporal evolution explicit, enabling processing signature-based representations via sequential modeling approaches. In contrast to full signatures, ISC is inherently sensitive to instantaneous trajectory updates, which is critical for sensitive and stability-requiring control dynamics. Building on this representation, we introduce ISC-Transformer (ISCT), an offline reinforcement learning model that integrates ISC into a standard Transformer architecture without further architectural modification.

However, these properties typically require complex observational techniques or expensive particle-resolved numerical simulations, limiting the availability of labeled data. We therefore estimate these hard-to-measure particle properties from routinely available observations (e.g., air pollutant concentrations and meteorological conditions). Because routine observations only indirectly reflect particle composition and structure, the mapping from routine observations to particle properties is noisy and input-dependent, yielding a heteroscedastic regression setting. With a limited and costly labeling budget, the central challenge is to select which samples to measure or simulate. While active learning is a natural approach, most acquisition strategies rely on predictive uncertainty. Under heteroscedastic noise, this signal conflates reducible epistemic uncertainty with irreducible aleatoric uncertainty, causing limited budgets to be wasted in noise-dominated regions. To address this challenge, we propose a confidence-aware active learning framework (CAAL) for efficient and robust sample selection in heteroscedastic settings. CAAL consists of two components: a decoupled uncertainty-aware training objective that separately optimises the predictive mean and noise level to stabilise uncertainty estimation, and a confidence-aware acquisition function that dynamically weights epistemic uncertainty using predicted aleatoric uncertainty as a reliability signal. Experiments on particle-resolved numerical simulations and real atmospheric observations show that CAAL consistently outperforms standard AL baselines. The proposed framework provides a practical and general solution for the efficient expansion of high-cost atmospheric particle property databases.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

When excessive signal degradation occurs, regeneration is required through regenerators installed at selected network nodes. In this work, both network links and nodes are subject to uncertainty. The installation costs of regenerators are modeled using a budgeted uncertainty set. In addition, link lengths follow a dynamic budgeted uncertainty set introduced in this paper, where deviations may vary over time. Robust optimization seeks solutions whose performance is guaranteed under all scenarios represented by the underlying uncertainty set. Accordingly, the objective is to identify a minimum-cost subset of nodes for regenerator deployment that ensures full network connectivity, even under the worst possible realizations of uncertainty. To solve the problem, we first formulate it within a robust optimization framework, and then develop scalable solution methods based on column-and-constraint generation, Benders decomposition, and iterative robust optimization. In addition, we formulate a learning-based hide-and-seek game to further analyze the problem structure. The proposed approaches are evaluated against classical static budgeted robust models and deterministic worst-case formulations.

We study this in-context learning phenomenon through the lens of Gaussian Processes (GPs). We build controlled experiments where models observe sequences of multivariate scalar-valued function samples drawn from known GP priors. We evaluate prediction error in relation to the number of demonstrations and compare against two principled references: (i) an empirical GP-regression learner that gives a lower bound on achievable error, and (ii) the expected error of a 1-nearest-neighbor (1-NN) rule, which gives a data-driven upper bound. Across model sizes, we find that LLM learning curves are strongly influenced by the function-generating kernels and approach the GP lower bound as the number of demonstrations increases. We then study the inductive biases of these models using a likelihood-based analysis. We find that LLM predictions are most likely under less smooth GP kernels. Finally, we explore whether post-training can shift these inductive biases and improve sample-efficiency on functions sampled from GPs with smoother kernels. We find that both reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning can effectively shift inductive biases in the direction of the training data. Together, our framework quantifies the extent to which LLMs behave like GP learners and provides tools for steering their inductive biases for continuous function learning tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Focusing on near-surface variables, we evaluate probabilistic forecasts against independent in situ station observations over lead times up to 90 h. Across a diverse set of AI-based and numerical weather prediction (NWP) systems, the ensemble mean of the downscaled forecasts consistently improves upon each model's own raw deterministic forecast, and substantially larger gains are observed in probabilistic skill as measured by CRPS.

DPO weighs each update relative to a reference, which stabilizes the training by regularizing the updates within a trusted region. This reliance becomes problematic for pessimistic pairs, where the reference model prefers the rejected response. For these pairs, DPO prematurely attenuates the gradient as soon as the policy margin ($\u0394_\u03b8$) merely beats the reference margin ($\u0394_{\\mathrm{ref}}$) even if the policy is still wrong ($\u0394_\u03b8<0$). We name this failure premature satisfaction, which is a concrete form of the training-inference mismatch. Reference-free objectives remove this mismatch by optimizing the absolute margin, but at the cost of discarding the stabilizing signal of the reference. We mitigate this tension with Hybrid-DPO (HyPO), a drop-in modification to DPO that applies reference conditionally: HyPO behaves exactly like DPO when the reference is optimistic or neutral, and it treats the reference as neutral when it is pessimistic by replacing $\u0394_\u03b8-\u0394_{\\mathrm{ref}}$ with $\u0394_\u03b8-\\max\\{0,\u0394_{\\mathrm{ref}}\\}$. This one-line change strictly strengthens per-example learning signals on pessimistic pairs while preserving DPO's objective form and computational cost.

Our results provide evidence that direct preference alignment could be enhanced by conditionally debiasing the reference signal, rather than discarding it.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The learner receives a sample labeled by an unknown target concept from a known concept class, as in standard PAC learning. However, instead of learning the target concept itself, the goal is to predict, for each instance, the average label over its neighborhood -- an arbitrary subset of points that contains the instance. In the degenerate case where all neighborhoods are singletons, the problem reduces exactly to classic PAC learning. More generally, it extends PAC learning to a setting that captures learning tasks arising in several domains, including explainability, fairness, and recommendation systems. Our main contribution is a complete characterization of when conditional averages are learnable, together with sample complexity bounds that are tight up to logarithmic factors. The characterization hinges on the joint finiteness of two novel combinatorial parameters, which depend on both the concept class and the neighborhood system, and are closely related to the independence number of the associated neighborhood graph.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5728PAC\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5f15\u5165\u6761\u4ef6\u5e73\u5747\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u6839\u636e\u5b9e\u4f8b\u90bb\u57df\u5185\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6807\u7b7e\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u6982\u5ff5\u672c\u8eab\u3002\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u5c06\u7ecf\u5178PAC\u5b66\u4e60\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ecf\u5178PAC\u5b66\u4e60\u5173\u6ce8\u76ee\u6807\u6982\u5ff5\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff08\u5982\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3001\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\uff09\u9700\u8981\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5728\u90bb\u57df\u5185\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6807\u7b7e\u3002\u8fd9\u4fc3\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u6269\u5c55PAC\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e24\u4e2a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6982\u5ff5\u7c7b\u548c\u90bb\u57df\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u8054\u5408\u6709\u9650\u6027\u3002\u5229\u7528\u90bb\u57df\u56fe\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u6570\u5efa\u7acb\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed9\u51fa\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u754c\u9650\u3002", "result": "\u5b8c\u5168\u523b\u753b\u4e86\u6761\u4ef6\u5e73\u5747\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u7d27\u81f4\uff08\u81f3\u591a\u5bf9\u6570\u56e0\u5b50\uff09\u7684\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u754c\u9650\u3002\u5f53\u6240\u6709\u90bb\u57df\u4e3a\u5355\u70b9\u65f6\uff0c\u95ee\u9898\u9000\u5316\u4e3a\u7ecf\u5178PAC\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6761\u4ef6\u5e73\u5747\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86PAC\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u53ef\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u9886\u57df\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u7ec4\u5408\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u8054\u5408\u6709\u9650\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We extend and apply Puzzle, a post-training neural architecture search (NAS) framework, to gpt-oss-120B to produce gpt-oss-puzzle-88B, a deployment-optimized derivative. Our approach combines heterogeneous MoE expert pruning, selective replacement of full-context attention with window attention, FP8 KV-cache quantization with calibrated scales, and post-training reinforcement learning to recover accuracy, while maintaining low generation length. In terms of per-token speeds, on an 8XH100 node we achieve 1.63X and 1.22X throughput speedups in long-context and short-context settings, respectively. gpt-oss-puzzle-88B also delivers throughput speedups of 2.82X on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU. However, because token counts can change with reasoning effort and model variants, per-token throughput (tok/s) and latency (ms/token) do not necessarily lead to end-to-end speedups: a 2X throughput gain is erased if traces grow 2X. Conversely, throughput gains can be spent on more reasoning tokens to improve accuracy; we therefore advocate request-level efficiency metrics that normalize throughput by tokens generated and trace an accuracy--speed frontier across reasoning efforts. We show that gpt-oss-puzzle-88B improves over gpt-oss-120B along the entire frontier, delivering up to 1.29X higher request-level efficiency. Across various benchmarks, gpt-oss-puzzle-88B matches or slightly exceeds the parent on suite-average accuracy across reasoning efforts, with retention ranging from 100.8% (high) to 108.2% (low), showing that post-training architecture search can substantially reduce inference costs without sacrificing quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing attack methods in the forecasting field typically ignore the temporal consistency inherent in time series data, leading to divergent and contradictory perturbation values for the same timestamp across overlapping samples. This temporally inconsistent perturbations problem renders adversarial attacks impractical for real-world data manipulation. To address this, we introduce Temporally Unified Adversarial Perturbations (TUAPs), which enforce a temporal unification constraint to ensure identical perturbations for each timestamp across all overlapping samples. Moreover, we propose a novel Timestamp-wise Gradient Accumulation Method (TGAM) that provides a modular and efficient approach to effectively generate TUAPs by aggregating local gradient information from overlapping samples. By integrating TGAM with momentum-based attack algorithms, we ensure strict temporal consistency while fully utilizing series-level gradient information to explore the adversarial perturbation space. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets and four representative state-of-the-art models demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms baselines in both white-box and black-box transfer attack scenarios under TUAP constraints.

Especially when decisions have a direct impact on humans, this can be highly unsatisfactory. For a person subject to high disagreement between models, one could as well have chosen a different model of similar overall accuracy that would have decided the person's case differently. We argue that this arbitrariness conflicts with the EU AI Act, which requires providers of high-risk AI systems to report performance not only at the dataset level but also for specific persons. The goal of this paper is to put predictive multiplicity in context with the EU AI Act's provisions on accuracy and to subsequently derive concrete suggestions on how to evaluate and report predictive multiplicity in practice. Specifically: (1) We argue that incorporating information about predictive multiplicity can serve compliance with the EU AI Act's accuracy provisions for providers. (2) Based on this legal analysis, we suggest individual conflict ratios and $\u03b4$-ambiguity as tools to quantify the disagreement between models on individual cases and to help detect individuals subject to conflicting predictions. (3) Based on computational insights, we derive easy-to-implement rules on how model providers could evaluate predictive multiplicity in practice.

To address this limitation, we introduce Random Access Memory Network (RAM-Net), a novel architecture designed to bridge the gap between the representational capacity of full attention and the memory efficiency of linear models. The core of RAM-Net maps inputs to high-dimensional sparse vectors serving as explicit addresses, allowing the model to selectively access a massive memory state. This design enables exponential state size scaling without additional parameters, which significantly mitigates signal interference and enhances retrieval fidelity. Moreover, the inherent sparsity ensures exceptional computational efficiency, as state updates are confined to minimal entries.

While Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) seeks to model such structured evolution, existing approaches characterize model adaptation in the full parameter space. This formulation becomes computationally infeasible for modern LLMs. This paper introduces a geometric reformulation of TDG under parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We establish that the low-dimensional temporal structure underlying model evolution can be preserved under parameter-efficient reparameterization, enabling temporal modeling without operating in the ambient parameter space. Building on this principle, we propose Manifold-aware Temporal LoRA (MaT-LoRA), which constrains temporal updates to a shared low-dimensional manifold within a low-rank adaptation subspace, and models its evolution through a structured temporal core. This reparameterization dramatically reduces temporal modeling complexity while retaining expressive power.

This nonstationarity challenges theoretical analysis, as it violates classical assumptions of i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) samples, necessitating algorithms capable of real-time updates without expensive retraining. An effective approach should process each sample in a single pass, while maintaining computational and memory complexities independent of the data stream length. Motivated by these challenges, this paper investigates the Momentum Least Mean Squares (MLMS) algorithm as an adaptive identification tool, leveraging its computational simplicity and online processing capabilities. Theoretically, we derive tracking performance and regret bounds for the MLMS in time-varying stochastic linear systems under various practical conditions. Unlike classical LMS, whose stability can be characterized by first-order random vector difference equations, MLMS introduces an additional dynamical state due to momentum, leading to second-order time-varying random vector difference equations whose stability analysis hinges on more complicated products of random matrices, which poses a substantially challenging problem to resolve. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data streams demonstrate that MLMS achieves rapid adaptation and robust tracking, in agreement with our theoretical results especially in nonstationary settings, highlighting its promise for modern streaming and online learning applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6d41\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u91cf\u6700\u5c0f\u5747\u65b9\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u65f6\u53d8\u968f\u673a\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5feb\u901f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u8ddf\u8e2a\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u901a\u5e38\u4ee5\u987a\u5e8f\u6d41\u5f62\u5f0f\u5230\u8fbe\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u6765\u81ea\u590d\u6742\u7684\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6f02\u79fb\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u65f6\u53d8\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u8fdd\u80cc\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfi.i.d.\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0\u800c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u91cf\u6700\u5c0f\u5747\u65b9\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fa8\u8bc6\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5176\u5728\u65f6\u53d8\u968f\u673a\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6094\u754c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u7531\u4e8e\u5f15\u5165\u52a8\u91cf\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4e8c\u9636\u65f6\u53d8\u968f\u673a\u5411\u91cf\u5dee\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5f97\u51fa\u4e86MLMS\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u5b9e\u9645\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6094\u754c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aMLMS\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "MLMS\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u91cf\u673a\u5236\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u6d41\u5904\u7406\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5e7f\u9614\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

Existing methods based on model level or representation level knowledge transfer either require expensive local training or incur high communication costs and introduce unavoidable privacy risks. We reformulate this problem as a reinforcement learning style evaluation process and propose FedGRPO, a privacy preserving framework comprising two modules. The first module performs competence-based expert selection by building a lightweight confidence graph from auxiliary data to identify the most suitable clients for each question. The second module leverages the \"Group Relative\" concept from the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework by packaging each question together with its solution rationale into candidate policies, dispatching these policies to a selected subset of expert clients, and aggregating solely the resulting scalar reward signals via a federated group-relative loss function. By exchanging reward values instead of data or model updates, FedGRPO reduces privacy risk and communication overhead while enabling parallel evaluation across heterogeneous devices.

This execution pattern repeatedly processes the same prompt prefix across models. Consequently, each model redundantly executes the prefill stage and maintains its own key-value (KV) cache, increasing aggregate prefill load and worsening tail latency by intensifying prefill-decode interference in existing LLM serving stacks. Disaggregated serving reduces such interference by placing prefill and decode on separate GPUs, but disaggregation does not fundamentally eliminate inter-model redundancy in computation and KV storage for the same prompt. To address this issue, we propose PrefillShare, a novel algorithm that enables sharing the prefill stage across multiple models in a disaggregated setting. PrefillShare factorizes the model into prefill and decode modules, freezes the prefill module, and fine-tunes only the decode module. This design allows multiple task-specific models to share a prefill module and the KV cache generated for the same prompt. We further introduce a routing mechanism that enables effective prefill sharing across heterogeneous models in a vLLM-based disaggregated system. PrefillShare not only matches full fine-tuning accuracy on a broad range of tasks and models, but also delivers 4.5x lower p95 latency and 3.9x higher throughput in multi-model agent workloads.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although prior work has explored automatic event detection using player and ball trajectories, ball tracking also remains difficult to scale due to high infrastructural and operational costs. As a result, comprehensive data collection in soccer is largely confined to top-tier competitions, limiting the broader adoption of data-driven analysis in this domain. To address this challenge, this paper proposes PathCRF, a framework for detecting on-ball soccer events using only player tracking data. We model player trajectories as a fully connected dynamic graph and formulate event detection as the problem of selecting exactly one edge corresponding to the current possession state at each time step. To ensure logical consistency of the resulting edge sequence, we employ a Conditional Random Field (CRF) that forbids impossible transitions between consecutive edges. Both emission and transition scores dynamically computed from edge embeddings produced by a Set Attention-based backbone architecture. During inference, the most probable edge sequence is obtained via Viterbi decoding, and events such as ball controls or passes are detected whenever the selected edge changes between adjacent time steps. Experiments show that PathCRF produces accurate, logically consistent possession paths, enabling reliable downstream analyses while substantially reducing the need for manual event annotation.

The proposed metric space formulation provides a geometric interpretation of uncertainty without the need for explicit probabilistic modeling. To achieve this, we introduce a multimodal latent transition model and a sensor fusion mechanism based on inverse distance weighting, allowing for the adaptive integration of multiple sensor modalities without prior knowledge of noise distributions. We empirically validate the approach on a range of multimodal RL tasks, demonstrating improved robustness to sensor noise and superior state estimation compared to baseline methods. Our experiments show enhanced performance of an RL agent via the learned representation, eliminating the need of explicit noise augmentation. The presented results suggest that leveraging transition-aware metric spaces provides a principled and scalable solution for robust state estimation in sequential decision-making.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u72b6\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u76f4\u63a5\u4e0e\u72b6\u6001\u95f4\u8f6c\u6362\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6700\u5c11\u52a8\u4f5c\u6570\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5ea6\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u516c\u5f0f\u4e3a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u51e0\u4f55\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u6982\u7387\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u9ad8\u7ef4\u3001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u73af\u5883\u72b6\u6001\u662f\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u8003\u8651\u566a\u58f0\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6f5c\u5728\u8f6c\u6362\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u8ddd\u79bb\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6a21\u6001\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u5148\u9a8c\u566a\u58f0\u5206\u5e03\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001RL\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u566a\u58f0\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6548\u679c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8868\u793a\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86RL\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u566a\u58f0\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u8f6c\u6362\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e3a\u987a\u5e8f\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Our work is inspired by the following open question: \"Are $Q^\\star$-realizability and Bellman completeness sufficient for sample-efficient offline RL under partial coverage?\"\n  We answer in the negative by establishing an information-theoretic lower bound. Going substantially beyond this, we introduce a general framework that characterizes the intrinsic complexity of a given $Q^\\star$ function class, inspired by model-free decision-estimation coefficients (DEC) for online RL (Foster et al., 2023b; Liu et al., 2025b). This complexity recovers and improves the quantities underlying the guarantees of Chen and Jiang (2022) and Uehara et al. (2023), and extends to broader settings. Our decision-estimation decomposition can be combined with a wide range of $Q^\\star$ estimation procedures, modularizing and generalizing existing approaches.\n  Beyond the general framework, we make further contributions: By developing a novel second-order performance difference lemma, we obtain the first $\u03b5^{-2}$ sample complexity under partial coverage for soft $Q$-learning, improving the $\u03b5^{-4}$ bound of Uehara et al. (2023). We remove Chen and Jiang's (2022) need for additional online interaction when the value gap of $Q^\\star$ is unknown. We also give the first characterization of offline learnability for general low-Bellman-rank MDPs without Bellman completeness (Jiang et al., 2017; Du et al., 2021; Jin et al., 2021), a canonical setting in online RL that remains unexplored in offline RL except for special cases.

Timely monitoring of tropical cyclones is crucial for reducing loss of life and property, yet it is hindered by the computational inefficiency and high parameter counts of existing methods on resource-constrained edge devices. Current physics-guided models suffer from linear feature interactions that fail to capture high-order polynomial relationships between TC attributes, leading to inflated model sizes and hardware incompatibility. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network-based Feature Interaction Framework (KAN-FIF), a lightweight multimodal architecture that integrates MLP and CNN layers with spline-parameterized KAN layers. For Maximum Sustained Wind (MSW) prediction, experiments demonstrate that the KAN-FIF framework achieves a $94.8\\%$ reduction in parameters (0.99MB vs 19MB) and $68.7\\%$ faster inference per sample (2.3ms vs 7.35ms) compared to baseline model Phy-CoCo, while maintaining superior accuracy with $32.5\\%$ lower MAE. The offline deployment experiment of the FY-4 series meteorological satellite processor on the Qingyun-1000 development board achieved a 14.41ms per-sample inference latency with the KAN-FIF framework, demonstrating promising feasibility for operational TC monitoring and extending deployability to edge-device AI applications.

We investigate whether language models, when trained with reinforcement learning (RL) in environments with implicit loopholes, will spontaneously learn to exploit these flaws to maximize their reward, even without any malicious intent in their training. To test this, we design a suite of four diverse \"vulnerability games\", each presenting a unique, exploitable flaw related to context-conditional compliance, proxy metrics, reward tampering, and self-evaluation. Our experiments show that models consistently learn to exploit these vulnerabilities, discovering opportunistic strategies that significantly increase their reward at the expense of task correctness or safety. More critically, we find that these exploitative strategies are not narrow \"tricks\" but generalizable skills; they can be transferred to new tasks and even \"distilled\" from a capable teacher model to other student models through data alone. Our findings reveal that capability-oriented training induced risks pose a fundamental challenge to current alignment approaches, suggesting that future AI safety work must extend beyond content moderation to rigorously auditing and securing the training environments and reward mechanisms themselves.

In this work, we first theoretically show that OPD is a special case of dense KL-constrained RL where the reward function and the KL regularization are always weighted equally and the reference model can by any model. Then, we propose the Generalized On-Policy Distillation (G-OPD) framework, which extends the standard OPD objective by introducing a flexible reference model and a reward scaling factor that controls the relative weight of the reward term against the KL regularization. Through comprehensive experiments on math reasoning and code generation tasks, we derive two novel insights: (1) Setting the reward scaling factor to be greater than 1 (i.e., reward extrapolation), which we term ExOPD, consistently improves over standard OPD across a range of teacher-student size pairings. In particular, in the setting where we merge the knowledge from different domain experts, obtained by applying domain-specific RL to the same student model, back into the original student, ExOPD enables the student to even surpass the teacher's performance boundary and outperform the domain teachers. (2) Building on ExOPD, we further find that in the strong-to-weak distillation setting (i.e., distilling a smaller student from a larger teacher), performing reward correction by choosing the reference model as the teacher's base model before RL yields a more accurate reward signal and further improves distillation performance. However, this choice assumes access to the teacher's pre-RL variant and incurs more computational overhead. We hope our work offers new insights for future research on OPD.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) effectively handle irregular time series by modelling hidden states as continuously evolving trajectories. ContiFormers arxiv:2402.10635 combine NODEs with Transformers, but inherit the computational bottleneck of the former by using heavy numerical solvers. This bottleneck can be removed by using a closed-form solution for the given dynamical system - but this is known to be intractable in general! We obviate this by replacing NODEs with a novel linear damped harmonic oscillator analogy - which has a known closed-form solution. We model keys and values as damped, driven oscillators and expand the query in a sinusoidal basis up to a suitable number of modes. This analogy naturally captures the query-key coupling that is fundamental to any transformer architecture by modelling attention as a resonance phenomenon. Our closed-form solution eliminates the computational overhead of numerical ODE solvers while preserving expressivity. We prove that this oscillator-based parameterisation maintains the universal approximation property of continuous-time attention; specifically, any discrete attention matrix realisable by ContiFormer's continuous keys can be approximated arbitrarily well by our fixed oscillator modes.

To bridge these gaps, we introduce TIME, a next-generation task-centric benchmark comprising 50 fresh datasets and 98 forecasting tasks, tailored for strict zero-shot TSFM evaluation free from data leakage. Integrating large language models and human expertise, we establish a rigorous human-in-the-loop benchmark construction pipeline to ensure high data integrity and redefine task formulation by aligning forecasting configurations with real-world operational requirements and variate predictability.

In this work, we propose SafeNeuron, a neuron-level safety alignment framework that improves robustness by redistributing safety representations across the network. SafeNeuron first identifies safety-related neurons, then freezes these neurons during preference optimization to prevent reliance on sparse safety pathways and force the model to construct redundant safety representations. Extensive experiments across models and modalities demonstrate that SafeNeuron significantly improves robustness against neuron pruning attacks, reduces the risk of open-source models being repurposed as red-team generators, and preserves general capabilities.

We prove that these dynamics can exhibit persistent oscillations or entropy collapse for certain parameter choices, and characterize regimes that guarantee stability. Our theoretical insights extend to Direct Preference Optimization, indicating the phenomena we captured are common to a broader class of preference-alignment methods.

We conduct a comprehensive empirical study of this space, identifying which design choices lead to a strong mixing method.

We study how to efficiently recompute the mixture after the domain set is updated, leveraging information from past mixtures. We introduce mixture reuse, a mechanism that reuses existing ratios and recomputes ratios only for domains affected by the update.

Community attribution in social and critical infrastructure networks, for example, can expose coordinated asset groups, operational hierarchies, and system dependencies that could be used for profiling or intelligence gathering. We study a defensive setting in which a data publisher (defender) seeks to conceal a community of interest while making limited, utility-aware changes in the network. Our analysis indicates that community concealment is strongly influenced by two quantifiable factors: connectivity at the community boundary and feature similarity between the protected community and adjacent communities. Informed by these findings, we present a perturbation strategy that rewires a set of selected edges and modifies node features to reduce the distinctiveness leveraged by GNN message passing. The proposed method outperforms DICE in our experiments on synthetic benchmarks and real network graphs under identical perturbation budgets. Overall, it achieves median relative concealment improvements of approximately 20-45% across the evaluated settings.

Instead of this static design, we propose treating the corruption level as a new degree of freedom for representation learning, enhancing flexibility and performance. To achieve this, we introduce the Flow-Guided Neural Operator (FGNO), a novel framework combining operator learning with flow matching for SSL training. FGNO learns mappings in functional spaces by using Short-Time Fourier Transform to unify different time resolutions. We extract a rich hierarchy of features by tapping into different network layers and flow times that apply varying strengths of noise to the input data. This enables the extraction of versatile representations, from low-level patterns to high-level global features, using a single model adaptable to specific tasks. Unlike prior generative SSL methods that use noisy inputs during inference, we propose using clean inputs for representation extraction while learning representations with noise; this eliminates randomness and boosts accuracy. We evaluate FGNO across three biomedical domains, where it consistently outperforms established baselines. Our method yields up to 35% AUROC gains in neural signal decoding (BrainTreeBank), 16% RMSE reductions in skin temperature prediction (DREAMT), and over 20% improvement in accuracy and macro-F1 on SleepEDF under low-data regimes.

We present Fun-DDPS, a generative framework that combines function-space diffusion models with differentiable neural operator surrogates for both forward and inverse modeling. Our approach learns a prior distribution over geological parameters (geomodel) using a single-channel diffusion model, then leverages a Local Neural Operator (LNO) surrogate to provide physics-consistent guidance for cross-field conditioning on the dynamics field. This decoupling allows the diffusion prior to robustly recover missing information in parameter space, while the surrogate provides efficient gradient-based guidance for data assimilation. We demonstrate Fun-DDPS on synthetic CCS modeling datasets, achieving two key results: (1) For forward modeling with only 25% observations, Fun-DDPS achieves 7.7% relative error compared to 86.9% for standard surrogates (an 11x improvement), proving its capability to handle extreme data sparsity where deterministic methods fail. (2) We provide the first rigorous validation of diffusion-based inverse solvers against asymptotically exact Rejection Sampling (RS) posteriors.

Crucially, Fun-DDPS produces physically consistent realizations free from the high-frequency artifacts observed in joint-state baselines, achieving this with 4x improved sample efficiency compared to rejection sampling.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
