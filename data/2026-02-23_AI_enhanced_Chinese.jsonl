This paper investigates the jamming mitigation by leveraging an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS), where the channel uncertainties are particularly addressed for robust anti-jamming design. Towards this issue, we adopt the Stackelberg game formulation to model the strategic interaction between the legitimate side and the adversary, acting as the leader and follower, respectively. We prove the existence of the game equilibrium and adopt the backward induction method for equilibrium analysis. We first derive the optimal jamming policy as the follower's best response, which is then incorporated into the legitimate-side optimization for robust anti-jamming design. We address the uncertainty issue and reformulate the legitimate-side problem by exploiting the error bounds to combat the worst-case jamming attacks. The problem is decomposed within a block successive upper bound minimization (BSUM) framework to tackle the power allocation, transceiving beamforming, and active reflection, respectively, which are iterated towards the robust jamming mitigation scheme. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in protecting the legitimate transmissions under uncertainties, and the superior performance in terms of jamming mitigation as compared with the baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u4e3b\u52a8\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u9762\uff08ARIS\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u901a\u4fe1\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u7528Stackelberg\u535a\u5f08\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u5408\u6cd5\u65b9\u4e0e\u5e72\u6270\u65b9\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u5206\u6790\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u6076\u610f\u5e72\u6270\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u901a\u4fe1\u6784\u6210\u6301\u7eed\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u5e72\u6270\u65b9\u80fd\u529b\u589e\u5f3a\uff08\u80fd\u9002\u5e94\u5408\u6cd5\u4f20\u8f93\uff09\uff0c\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u6311\u6218\u65e5\u76ca\u4e25\u5cfb\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5229\u7528ARIS\u8fdb\u884c\u5e72\u6270\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9c81\u68d2\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "1. \u91c7\u7528Stackelberg\u535a\u5f08\u5efa\u6a21\u5408\u6cd5\u65b9\uff08\u9886\u5bfc\u8005\uff09\u4e0e\u5e72\u6270\u65b9\uff08\u8ddf\u968f\u8005\uff09\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4e92\u52a8\uff1b2. \u8bc1\u660e\u535a\u5f08\u5747\u8861\u5b58\u5728\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u9006\u5411\u5f52\u7eb3\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u5747\u8861\uff1b3. \u63a8\u5bfc\u5e72\u6270\u65b9\u6700\u4f18\u5e72\u6270\u7b56\u7565\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ddf\u968f\u8005\u6700\u4f73\u54cd\u5e94\uff1b4. \u8003\u8651\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8bef\u5dee\u8fb9\u754c\u91cd\u6784\u5408\u6cd5\u65b9\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u5e72\u6270\u653b\u51fb\uff1b5. \u5728BSUM\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u5206\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5206\u522b\u4f18\u5316\u529f\u7387\u5206\u914d\u3001\u6536\u53d1\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u53cd\u5c04\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u6c42\u89e3\u9c81\u68d2\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u62a4\u5408\u6cd5\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u5e72\u6270\u6291\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eARIS\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Stackelberg\u535a\u5f08\u5206\u6790\u548cBSUM\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u6291\u5236\u3002"}}

Then, we consider the Euclidean and Hermitian duals of the derived cyclic codes over $\\mathcal{R}$. Under the module isometry for $\\mathcal{R}$, we use the Bachoc map and the Gray map, which takes a derived cyclic code over $\\mathcal{R}$ to $\\mathbb F_{16}$.

Current safety paradigms treat these failures as transient training artifacts, lacking a unified theoretical framework to explain their emergence and stability. Here we show that these misalignments are not errors, but mathematically rationalizable behaviors arising from model misspecification. By adapting Berk-Nash Rationalizability from theoretical economics to artificial intelligence, we derive a rigorous framework that models the agent as optimizing against a flawed subjective world model. We demonstrate that widely observed failures are structural necessities: unsafe behaviors emerge as either a stable misaligned equilibrium or oscillatory cycles depending on reward scheme, while strategic deception persists as a \"locked-in\" equilibrium or through epistemic indeterminacy robust to objective risks. We validate these theoretical predictions through behavioral experiments on six state-of-the-art model families, generating phase diagrams that precisely map the topological boundaries of safe behavior. Our findings reveal that safety is a discrete phase determined by the agent's epistemic priors rather than a continuous function of reward magnitude. This establishes Subjective Model Engineering, defined as the design of an agent's internal belief structure, as a necessary condition for robust alignment, marking a paradigm shift from manipulating environmental rewards to shaping the agent's interpretation of reality.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A central challenge is the Access Point Selection (APS) problem, which seeks to determine the subset of serving Access Points (APs) for each User Equipment (UE) that can satisfy UEs' Spectral Efficiency (SE) requirements while minimizing network power consumption. We introduce APS-GNN, a scalable distributed multi-agent learning framework that decomposes APS into agents operating at the granularity of individual AP-UE connections. Agents coordinate via local observation exchange over a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture and share parameters to reuse their knowledge and experience. APS-GNN adopts a constrained reinforcement learning approach to provide agents with explicit observability of APS' conflicting objectives, treating SE satisfaction as a cost and power reduction as a reward. Both signals are defined locally, facilitating effective credit assignment and scalable coordination in large networks. To further improve training stability and exploration efficiency, the policy is initialized via supervised imitation learning from a heuristic APS baseline. We develop a realistic CFmMIMO simulator and demonstrate that APS-GNN delivers the target SE while activating 50-70% fewer APs than heuristic and centralized Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) baselines in different evaluation scenarios. Moreover, APS-GNN achieves one to two orders of magnitude lower inference latency than centralized MARL approaches due to its fully parallel and distributed execution. These results establish APS-GNN as a practical and scalable solution for APS in large-scale CFmMIMO networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

These challenges become particularly prominent when generating captions for motion-centric videos, where precise depiction of intricate movements and limb dynamics is crucial yet often neglected. To alleviate this gap, we introduce an automated annotation pipeline that integrates kinematic-based motion computation with linguistic parsing, enabling detailed decomposition and description of complex human motions. Based on this pipeline, we construct and release the Kinematic Parsing Motion Benchmark (KPM-Bench), a novel open-source dataset designed to facilitate fine-grained motion understanding. KPM-Bench consists of (i) fine-grained video-caption pairs that comprehensively illustrate limb-level dynamics in complex actions, (ii) diverse and challenging question-answer pairs focusing specifically on motion understanding, and (iii) a meticulously curated evaluation set specifically designed to assess hallucination phenomena associated with motion descriptions. Furthermore, to address hallucination issues systematically, we propose the linguistically grounded Motion Parsing and Extraction (MoPE) algorithm, capable of accurately extracting motion-specific attributes directly from textual captions. Leveraging MoPE, we introduce a precise hallucination evaluation metric that functions independently of large-scale vision-language or language-only models.

Existing methods that tackle text-to-hand-motion generation or hand animation captioning rely on studio-captured datasets with limited actions and contexts, making them costly to scale to \"in-the-wild\" settings. Further, contemporary models and their training schemes struggle to capture animation fidelity with text-motion alignment. To address this, we (1) introduce '3D Hands in the Wild' (3D-HIW), a dataset of 32K 3D hand-motion sequences and aligned text, and (2) propose CLUTCH, an LLM-based hand animation system with two critical innovations: (a) SHIFT, a novel VQ-VAE architecture to tokenize hand motion, and (b) a geometric refinement stage to finetune the LLM. To build 3D-HIW, we propose a data annotation pipeline that combines vision-language models (VLMs) and state-of-the-art 3D hand trackers, and apply it to a large corpus of egocentric action videos covering a wide range of scenarios. To fully capture motion in-the-wild, CLUTCH employs SHIFT, a part-modality decomposed VQ-VAE, which improves generalization and reconstruction fidelity. Finally, to improve animation quality, we introduce a geometric refinement stage, where CLUTCH is co-supervised with a reconstruction loss applied directly to decoded hand motion parameters. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on text-to-motion and motion-to-text tasks, establishing the first benchmark for scalable in-the-wild hand motion modelling.

However, subtle and variable tumour appearances, differences in imaging protocols, and limited expert availability make consistent interpretation difficult. While automated methods aim to address this, they rely on large expertly-annotated datasets that are often inconsistent, whereas manual delineation remains labour-intensive. This work aims to bridge the gap between automated and manual segmentation through a framework driven by user-provided point prompts, enabling accurate segmentation with minimal annotation effort.\n  Methods: The framework combines reinforcement learning (RL) with a region-growing segmentation process guided by user prompts. Starting from an initial point prompt, region-growing generates a preliminary segmentation, which is iteratively refined through RL. At each step, the RL agent observes the image and current segmentation to predict a new point, from which region growing updates the mask. A reward, balancing segmentation accuracy and voxel-wise uncertainty, encourages exploration of ambiguous regions, allowing the agent to escape local optima and perform sample-specific optimisation. Despite requiring fully supervised training, the framework bridges manual and fully automated segmentation at inference by substantially reducing user effort while outperforming current fully automated methods.\n  Results: The framework was evaluated on two public prostate MR datasets (PROMIS and PICAI, with 566 and 1090 cases). It outperformed the previous best automated methods by 9.9% and 8.9%, respectively, with performance comparable to manual radiologist segmentation, reducing annotation time tenfold.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Standard BO models the process as a black box and ignores the intermediate observations and the underlying process structure. Partially Observable Gaussian Process Networks (POGPN) model the process as a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). However, using intermediate observations is challenging when the observations are high-dimensional state-space time series. Process-expert knowledge can be used to extract low-dimensional latent features from the high-dimensional state-space data. We propose POGPN-JPSS, a framework that combines POGPN with Joint Parameter and State-Space (JPSS) modeling to use intermediate extracted information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of POGPN-JPSS on a challenging, high-dimensional simulation of a multi-stage bioethanol production process. Our results show that POGPN-JPSS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by achieving the desired performance threshold twice as fast and with greater reliability.

Human curation of hard questions is highly expensive, especially in recent benchmarks using PhD-level domain knowledge to challenge the most capable models. Even then, there is always a concern about whether these questions test genuine reasoning or if similar problems have been seen during training. Here, we take inspiration from 16th-century mathematical duels to design The Token Games (TTG): an evaluation framework where models challenge each other by creating their own puzzles. We leverage the format of Programming Puzzles - given a Python function that returns a boolean, find inputs that make it return True - to flexibly represent problems and enable verifying solutions. Using results from pairwise duels, we then compute Elo ratings, allowing us to compare models relative to each other.

This challenge is particularly acute in large-scale resource allocation for generative AI (GenAI) serving: insufficient capacity triggers shortages but hides the true demand, leaving the system with only a \"greater-than\" constraint. Standard decision-making approaches that rely on uncensored data suffer from selection bias, often locking the system into a self-reinforcing low-provisioning trap. To break this loop, this paper proposes an adaptive approach named PIC-Reinforcement Learning (PIC-RL), a closed-loop framework that transforms censoring from a data quality problem into a decision signal. PIC-RL integrates (1) Uncertainty-Aware Demand Prediction to manage the information-cost trade-off, (2) Pessimistic Surrogate Inference to construct decision-aligned conservative feedback from shortage events, and (3) Dual-Timescale Adaptation to stabilize online learning against distribution drift. The analysis provides theoretical guarantees that the feedback design corrects the selection bias inherent in naive learning. Experiments on production Alibaba GenAI traces demonstrate that PIC-RL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing service degradation by up to 50% while maintaining cost efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To combine the advantages of both, we propose BioBridge, a domain-adaptive continual pretraining framework for protein understanding. This framework employs Domain-Incremental Continual Pre-training (DICP) to infuse protein domain knowledge and general reasoning corpus into a LLM simultaneously, effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Cross-modal alignment is achieved via a PLM-Projector-LLM pipeline, which maps protein sequence embeddings into the semantic space of the language model. Ultimately, an end-to-end optimization is adopted to uniformly support various tasks, including protein property prediction and knowledge question-answering. Our proposed BioBridge demonstrates performance comparable to that of mainstream PLMs on multiple protein benchmarks, such as EC and BindingDB. It also achieves results on par with LLMs on general understanding tasks like MMLU and RACE.

In this work, we present El Agente Gr\u00e1fico, a single-agent framework that embeds LLM-driven decision-making within a type-safe execution environment and dynamic knowledge graphs for external persistence. Central to our approach is a structured abstraction of scientific concepts and an object-graph mapper that represents computational state as typed Python objects, stored either in memory or persisted in an external knowledge graph. This design enables context management through typed symbolic identifiers rather than raw text, thereby ensuring consistency, supporting provenance tracking, and enabling efficient tool orchestration. We evaluate the system by developing an automated benchmarking framework across a suite of university-level quantum chemistry tasks previously evaluated on a multi-agent system, demonstrating that a single agent, when coupled to a reliable execution engine, can robustly perform complex, multi-step, and parallel computations. We further extend this paradigm to two other large classes of applications: conformer ensemble generation and metal-organic framework design, where knowledge graphs serve as both memory and reasoning substrates.

This paper details how and when a message needs to be generated and relayed so that the incidents can be reported and managed in a timely manner. This paper addresses this challenge by providing a traffic incident management model to manage several traffic incidents efficiently. Additionally, we simulate this model using the VEINS simulator with vehicles, RSUs, and a TA. From the experiments, we measure the average number of transmissions required for reporting a single traffic incident while varying the vehicle density and relaying considerations. We consider two types of relaying. In one series of experiments, messages from regular vehicles and RSUs are relayed up to four hops. In another series of experiments, messages from the regular vehicles and RSUs are relayed until their generation time reaches sixty seconds. Additionally, messages from the official vehicles are relayed when they approach an incident or when the incident is cleared. Results from the simulations show that more vehicles are informed with four-hop relaying than sixty-second relaying in both cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

It has been shown to be effective to use virtual IHC images from H&E images for automatic HER2 scoring. However, the pixel-level virtual staining methods are computationally expensive and prone to reconstruction artifacts that can propagate diagnostic errors. To address these limitations, we propose the Latent-Guided Dual-Stream Network (LGD-Net), a novel framework that employes cross-modal feature hallucination instead of explicit pixel-level image generation.

In this paper, we propose MeDUET, a 3D Medical image Disentangled UnifiEd PreTraining framework that performs SSL in the Variational Autoencoder (VAE) latent space which explicitly disentangles domain-invariant content from domain-specific style. The token demixing mechanism serves to turn disentanglement from a modeling assumption into an empirically identifiable property.

Moreover, most studies focused primarily on traditional quantization schemes, whereas modern hardware increasingly supports the microscaling (MX) data format. Attempts to combine both showed severe performance degradation, leading prior work to introduce assumptions on the transformations. In this work, we take a complementary perspective.

We identify two sources of approximation error that may undermine the performance of CoT monitors in practice: information gap, which measures the extent to which the monitor can extract the information available in CoT, and elicitation error, which measures the extent to which the monitor approximates the optimal monitoring function. We further demonstrate that CoT monitorability can be systematically improved through targeted training objectives. To this end, we propose two complementary approaches: (a) an oracle-based method that directly rewards the monitored model for producing CoTs that maximize monitor accuracy, and (b) a more practical, label-free approach that maximizes conditional mutual information between outputs and CoTs.

While effective, these modules introduce significant architectural complexity and computational overhead. Recent studies suggest that plain Vision Transformer (ViT) encoders, when scaled with sufficient capacity and large-scale pre-training, can conduct accurate image segmentation without requiring specialized modules. Motivated by this observation, we propose the Video Encoder-only Mask Transformer (VidEoMT), a simple encoder-only video segmentation model that eliminates the need for dedicated tracking modules. To enable temporal modeling in an encoder-only ViT, VidEoMT introduces a lightweight query propagation mechanism that carries information across frames by reusing queries from the previous frame. To balance this with adaptability to new content, it employs a query fusion strategy that combines the propagated queries with a set of temporally-agnostic learned queries. As a result, VidEoMT attains the benefits of a tracker without added complexity, achieving competitive accuracy while being 5x--10x faster, running at up to 160 FPS with a ViT-L backbone.

Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) forecasting from satellite observations, however, remains challenging due to sparse and irregular sampling caused by cloud coverage, as well as the heterogeneous climatic conditions under which crops evolve. In this work, we propose a probabilistic forecasting framework specifically designed for field-level NDVI prediction under clear-sky acquisition constraints. The method leverages a transformer-based architecture that explicitly separates the modeling of historical vegetation dynamics from future exogenous information, integrating historical NDVI observations with both historical and future meteorological covariates. To address irregular revisit patterns and horizon-dependent uncertainty, we introduce a temporal-distance weighted quantile loss that aligns the training objective with the effective forecasting horizon. In addition, we incorporate cumulative and extreme-weather feature engineering to better capture delayed meteorological effects relevant to vegetation response. Extensive experiments on European satellite data demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms a diverse set of statistical, deep learning, and recent time series baselines across both point-wise and probabilistic evaluation metrics. Ablation studies further highlight the central role of target history, while showing that meteorological covariates provide complementary gains when jointly exploited.

In this study, we address this issue by uniting offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) with cross-embodiment learning. Offline RL leverages both expert and abundant suboptimal data, and cross-embodiment learning aggregates heterogeneous robot trajectories across diverse morphologies to acquire universal control priors. We perform a systematic analysis of this offline RL and cross-embodiment paradigm, providing a principled understanding of its strengths and limitations. To evaluate this offline RL and cross-embodiment paradigm, we construct a suite of locomotion datasets spanning 16 distinct robot platforms. Our experiments confirm that this combined approach excels at pre-training with datasets rich in suboptimal trajectories, outperforming pure behavior cloning. However, as the proportion of suboptimal data and the number of robot types increase, we observe that conflicting gradients across morphologies begin to impede learning. To mitigate this, we introduce an embodiment-based grouping strategy in which robots are clustered by morphological similarity and the model is updated with a group gradient. This simple, static grouping substantially reduces inter-robot conflicts and outperforms existing conflict-resolution methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u8de8\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f62\u6001\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f62\u6001\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u5206\u7ec4\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u51b2\u7a81", "motivation": "\u89c4\u6a21\u5316\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u53ef\u5229\u7528\u4e13\u5bb6\u548c\u6b21\u4f18\u6570\u636e\uff09\u548c\u8de8\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u805a\u5408\u5f02\u6784\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f68\u8ff9\u83b7\u53d6\u901a\u7528\u63a7\u5236\u5148\u9a8c\uff09", "method": "1) \u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b16\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b2) \u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u968f\u7740\u6b21\u4f18\u6570\u636e\u6bd4\u4f8b\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7c7b\u578b\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8de8\u5f62\u6001\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\u4f1a\u963b\u788d\u5b66\u4e60\uff1b3) \u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f62\u6001\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7684\u5206\u7ec4\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6309\u5f62\u6001\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ec4\u68af\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0", "result": "\u7ed3\u5408\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8de8\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u5bcc\u542b\u6b21\u4f18\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u7eaf\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u6b21\u4f18\u6570\u636e\u6bd4\u4f8b\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7c7b\u578b\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u8de8\u5f62\u6001\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9759\u6001\u5206\u7ec4\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u95f4\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u4e14\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u51b2\u7a81\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u8de8\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5bcc\u542b\u6b21\u4f18\u6570\u636e\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u3002\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f62\u6001\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u9759\u6001\u5206\u7ec4\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u662f\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u5411\u524d\u8fc8\u51fa\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4e00\u6b65"}}

Here, we construct a data-driven, numerical method to infer missing power load values in large-scale power grids. Given partial observations of power demands, the method estimates the operational state using a linear regression algorithm, exploiting statistical correlations within synthetic training datasets. We evaluate the performance of the method on three synthetic transmission grid test systems. Numerical experiments demonstrate the high accuracy achieved by the method in reconstructing missing demand values under various operating conditions. We further apply the method to real data for the transmission power grid of Switzerland. Despite the restricted number of observations in this dataset, the method infers missing power loads rather accurately. Furthermore, Newton-Raphson power flow solutions show that deviations between true and inferred values for power loads result in smaller deviations between true and inferred values for flows on power lines. This ensures that the estimated operational state correctly captures potential line contingencies. Overall, our results indicate that simple data-based regression techniques can provide an efficient and reliable alternative for state estimation in modern power grids.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing methods rely on external guidance to supply detailed missing state for instructing generative models to synthesize missing MRIs. However, manual indicators are not always available or reliable in real-world scenarios due to the unpredictable nature of clinical environments. Moreover, these explicit masks are not informative enough to provide guidance for improving semantic consistency. In this work, we argue that generative models should infer and recognize missing states in a self-perceptive manner, enabling them to better capture subtle anatomical and pathological variations. Towards this goal, we propose CoPeDiT, a general-purpose latent diffusion model equipped with completeness perception for unified synthesis of 3D MRIs. Specifically, we incorporate dedicated pretext tasks into our tokenizer, CoPeVAE, empowering it to learn completeness-aware discriminative prompts, and design MDiT3D, a specialized diffusion transformer architecture for 3D MRI synthesis, that effectively uses the learned prompts as guidance to enhance semantic consistency in 3D space. Comprehensive evaluations on three large-scale MRI datasets demonstrate that CoPeDiT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior robustness, generalizability, and flexibility.

CodeScaler is trained on carefully curated preference data derived from verified code problems and incorporates syntax-aware code extraction and validity-preserving reward shaping to ensure stable and robust optimization. Across five coding benchmarks, CodeScaler improves Qwen3-8B-Base by an average of +11.72 points, outperforming binary execution-based RL by +1.82 points, and enables scalable reinforcement learning on synthetic datasets without any test cases.

Experimental results over 100 test scenarios demonstrate that Masked PPO achieves superior mission efficiency and computational performance, visiting up to twice as many debris as Greedy and significantly outperforming MCTS in runtime.

We show that this assumption is false. Using SOMtime, a topology-preserving representation method based on high-capacity Self-Organizing Maps, we demonstrate that sensitive attributes such as age and income emerge as dominant latent axes in purely unsupervised embeddings, even when explicitly excluded from the input. On two large-scale real-world datasets (the World Values Survey across five countries and the Census-Income dataset), SOMtime recovers monotonic orderings aligned with withheld sensitive attributes, achieving Spearman correlations of up to 0.85, whereas PCA and UMAP typically remain below 0.23 (with a single exception reaching 0.31), and against t-SNE and autoencoders which achieve at most 0.34. Furthermore, unsupervised segmentation of SOMtime embeddings produces demographically skewed clusters, demonstrating downstream fairness risks without any supervised task. These findings establish that \\textit{fairness through unawareness} fails at the representation level for ordinal sensitive attributes and that fairness auditing must extend to unsupervised components of machine learning pipelines.

However, the inherently redundant nature of video sequences poses significant challenges for contemporary state-of-the-art models. These challenges stem from two primary aspects: 1) efficiently incorporating a larger number of frames within memory constraints, and 2) extracting discriminative information from the vast volume of input data. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end schema for long-form video understanding, which includes an information-density-based adaptive video sampler (AVS) and an autoencoder-based spatiotemporal video compressor (SVC) integrated with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). Our proposed system offers two major advantages: it adaptively and effectively captures essential information from video sequences of varying durations, and it achieves high compression rates while preserving crucial discriminative information. The proposed framework demonstrates promising performance across various benchmarks, excelling in both long-form video understanding tasks and standard video understanding benchmarks.

Code and models available at https://github.com/Bluesman79/ZACH-ViT", "summary": "Vision Transformers rely on positional embeddings and class tokens that encode fixed spatial priors. While effective for natural images, these priors may hinder generalization when spatial layout is weakly informative or inconsistent, a frequent condition in medical imaging and edge-deployed clinical systems. We introduce ZACH-ViT (Zero-token Adaptive Compact Hierarchical Vision Transformer), a compact Vision Transformer that removes both positional embeddings and the [CLS] token, achieving permutation invariance through global average pooling over patch representations. The term \"Zero-token\" specifically refers to removing the dedicated [CLS] aggregation token and positional embeddings; patch tokens remain unchanged and are processed normally. Adaptive residual projections preserve training stability in compact configurations while maintaining a strict parameter budget.\n  Evaluation is performed across seven MedMNIST datasets spanning binary and multi-class tasks under a strict few-shot protocol (50 samples per class, fixed hyperparameters, five random seeds). The empirical analysis demonstrates regime-dependent behavior: ZACH-ViT (0.25M parameters, trained from scratch) achieves its strongest advantage on BloodMNIST and remains competitive with TransMIL on PathMNIST, while its relative advantage decreases on datasets with strong anatomical priors (OCTMNIST, OrganAMNIST), consistent with the architectural hypothesis. These findings support the view that aligning architectural inductive bias with data structure can be more important than pursuing universal benchmark dominance. Despite its minimal size and lack of pretraining, ZACH-ViT achieves competitive performance while maintaining sub-second inference times, supporting deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments.

Crucially, enhancing policy expressiveness is pivotal for achieving superior performance. Diffusion-based generative models are well-positioned to meet this demand, having demonstrated remarkable expressiveness and multimodal representation in image generation and offline settings. Yet, their potential in online MARL remains largely under-explored. A major obstacle is that the intractable likelihoods of diffusion models impede entropy-based exploration and coordination. To tackle this challenge, we propose among the first \\underline{O}nline off-policy \\underline{MA}RL framework using \\underline{D}iffusion policies (\\textbf{OMAD}) to orchestrate coordination. Our key innovation is a relaxed policy objective that maximizes scaled joint entropy, facilitating effective exploration without relying on tractable likelihood. Complementing this, within the centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) paradigm, we employ a joint distributional value function to optimize decentralized diffusion policies. It leverages tractable entropy-augmented targets to guide the simultaneous updates of diffusion policies, thereby ensuring stable coordination.

The update laws are derived by solving a constrained optimization problem with affine equality constraints. This constrained problem is reformulated as an equivalent unconstrained problem in a new variable, thereby eliminating the equality constraints.

These improvements are evident in a wide range of VLMs built on a variety of base models, alignment architectures, and training data.

We test a large number of recent VLMs on fine-grained classification benchmarks and identify potential factors in the disconnect between fine-grained knowledge and other vision benchmarks. Through a series of ablation experiments, we find that using a better LLM improves all benchmark scores equally, while a better vision encoder disproportionately improves fine-grained classification performance.

While recent work suggests that high-dimensional concentration allows these models to implicitly estimate noise levels from corrupted observations, a fundamental paradox remains: what is the underlying landscape being optimized when the noise level is treated as a random variable, and how can a bounded, noise-agnostic network remain stable near the data manifold where gradients typically diverge? We resolve this paradox by formalizing Marginal Energy, $E_{\\text{marg}}(\\mathbf{u}) = -\\log p(\\mathbf{u})$, where $p(\\mathbf{u}) = \\int p(\\mathbf{u}|t)p(t)dt$ is the marginal density of the noisy data integrated over a prior distribution of unknown noise levels. We prove that generation using autonomous models is not merely blind denoising, but a specific form of Riemannian gradient flow on this Marginal Energy. Through a novel relative energy decomposition, we demonstrate that while the raw Marginal Energy landscape possesses a $1/t^p$ singularity normal to the data manifold, the learned time-invariant field implicitly incorporates a local conformal metric that perfectly counteracts the geometric singularity, converting an infinitely deep potential well into a stable attractor. We also establish the structural stability conditions for sampling with autonomous models. We identify a ``Jensen Gap'' in noise-prediction parameterizations that acts as a high-gain amplifier for estimation errors, explaining the catastrophic failure observed in deterministic blind models.

However, in practice, the quality and consistency of the synthesized views are fundamentally limited by the reliability of the underlying depth estimates, which are often fragile under low texture, adverse weather, and occlusion-heavy real-world conditions. In this work, we show that incorporating sparse multimodal range measurements provides a simple yet effective way to overcome these limitations. We introduce a multimodal depth reconstruction framework that leverages extremely sparse range sensing data, such as automotive radar or LiDAR, to produce dense depth maps that serve as robust geometric conditioning for diffusion-based novel view synthesis. Our approach models depth in an angular domain using a localized Gaussian Process formulation, enabling computationally efficient inference while explicitly quantifying uncertainty in regions with limited observations. The reconstructed depth and uncertainty are used as a drop-in replacement for monocular depth estimators in existing diffusion-based rendering pipelines, without modifying the generative model itself. Experiments on real-world multimodal driving scenes demonstrate that replacing vision-only depth with our sparse range-based reconstruction substantially improves both geometric consistency and visual quality in single-image novel-view video generation. These results highlight the importance of reliable geometric priors for diffusion-based view synthesis and demonstrate the practical benefits of multimodal sensing even at extreme levels of sparsity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u878d\u5408\u7a00\u758f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6d4b\u8ddd\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4f4e\u7eb9\u7406\u3001\u6076\u52a3\u5929\u6c14\u3001\u906e\u6321\u7b49\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5408\u6210\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df1\u5ea6\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6781\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u6d4b\u8ddd\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u96f7\u8fbe\u6216\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\uff09\u751f\u6210\u5bc6\u96c6\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u89d2\u57df\u5c40\u90e8\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u65ad\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u5c06\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u76f4\u63a5\u66ff\u6362\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6e32\u67d3\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5355\u76ee\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7528\u7a00\u758f\u6d4b\u8ddd\u91cd\u5efa\u6df1\u5ea6\u66ff\u6362\u7eaf\u89c6\u89c9\u6df1\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u51e0\u4f55\u5148\u9a8c\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u57fa\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u7a00\u758f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u4ecd\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u76ca\u3002"}}

Existing multi-modal pre-training methods largely overlook robustness, treating it as a downstream adaptation problem. In this work, we propose Robust Multi-Modal Masked Reconstruction (Robust-MMR), a self-supervised pre-training framework that explicitly incorporates robustness objectives into masked vision-language learning. Robust-MMR integrates asymmetric perturbation-aware masking, domain-consistency regularization, and modality-resilience constraints to encourage domain-invariant representations. We evaluate Robust-MMR on multiple medical vision-language benchmarks, including medical visual question answering (VQA-RAD, SLAKE, VQA-2019), cross-domain image-text classification (MELINDA), and robust image-caption retrieval (ROCO). Robust-MMR achieves 78.9% cross-domain accuracy on VQA-RAD, outperforming the strongest baseline by 3.8 percentage points, and reaches 74.6% and 77.0% accuracy on SLAKE and VQA-2019, respectively. Under perturbed evaluation, Robust-MMR improves VQA-RAD accuracy from 69.1% to 75.6%. For image-text classification, cross-domain MELINDA accuracy increases from 70.3% to 75.2%, while retrieval experiments show a reduction in mean rank degradation from over 16 to 4.1 under perturbation. Qualitative results further demonstrate improved clinical reasoning for disease detection and structural abnormality assessment.

As we pursue more ambitious scientific goals (e.g., multi-moon tours, missions with extensive components of autonomy), it becomes more crucial that missions are designed with navigation (Nav) processes in mind. The effect of Nav processes is statistical by nature, as they consist of orbit determination (OD) and flight-path control (FPC). Thus, this mission design paradigm calls for techniques that appropriately quantify statistical effects of Nav, evaluate associated risks, and design missions that ensure sufficiently low risk while minimizing a statistical performance metric; a common metric is Delta-V99: worst-case (99%-quantile) Delta-V expenditure including statistical FPC efforts. In response to the need, this paper develops an algorithm for risk-constrained trajectory optimization under operational uncertainties due to initial state dispersion, navigation error, maneuver execution error, and imperfect dynamics modeling. We formulate it as a nonlinear stochastic optimal control problem and develop a computationally tractable algorithm that combines optimal covariance steering and sequential convex programming (SCP). Specifically, the proposed algorithm takes a block-Cholesky approach for convex formulation of optimal covariance steering, and leverages a recent SCP algorithm, SCvx*, for reliable numerical convergence. We apply the developed algorithm to risk-constrained, statistical trajectory optimization for exploration of dwarf planet Ceres with a Mars gravity assist, and demonstrate the robustness of the statistically-optimal trajectory and FPC policies via nonlinear Monte Carlo simulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u7ea6\u675f\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6700\u4f18\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u51f8\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7a7a\u95f4\u4efb\u52a1\u79d1\u5b66\u76ee\u6807\u65e5\u76ca\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u5bfc\u822a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u5bf9\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u91cf\u5316\u5bfc\u822a\u7edf\u8ba1\u6548\u5e94\u3001\u8bc4\u4f30\u76f8\u5173\u98ce\u9669\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6ee1\u8db3\u98ce\u9669\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u968f\u673a\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5757Cholesky\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u63a7\u5236\u51f8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408SCvx*\u5e8f\u5217\u51f8\u89c4\u5212\u7b97\u6cd5\u786e\u4fdd\u6570\u503c\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5c06\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8c37\u795e\u661f\u63a2\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5305\u542b\u706b\u661f\u501f\u529b\uff09\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u7ea6\u675f\u7edf\u8ba1\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u98de\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5305\u542b\u5bfc\u822a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u7ea6\u675f\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u6ee1\u8db3\u98ce\u9669\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u7edf\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u3002"}}

We introduce ROCKET, a residual-oriented multi-layer representation alignment framework that formulates multi-layer alignment as aligning one residual stream to another. Concretely, ROCKET employs a shared projector to align multiple layers of the VLA backbone with multiple layers of a powerful 3D vision foundation model via a layer-invariant mapping, which reduces gradient conflicts. We provide both theoretical justification and empirical analyses showing that a shared projector is sufficient and outperforms prior designs, and further propose a Matryoshka-style sparse activation scheme for the shared projector to balance multiple alignment losses. Our experiments show that, combined with a training-free layer selection strategy, ROCKET requires only about 4% of the compute budget while achieving 98.5% state-of-the-art success rate on LIBERO. We further demonstrate the superior performance of ROCKET across LIBERO-Plus and RoboTwin, as well as multiple VLA models.

The memory pathway performs dependency closure-based unlearning that prunes isolated entities while logically invalidating shared artifacts. The parameter pathway employs stochastic reference alignment to guide model outputs toward a high-entropy prior. These pathways are integrated via a synchronized dual-update protocol, forming a closed-loop mechanism where memory unlearning and parametric suppression reinforce each other to prevent cross-pathway recontamination. Experiments on medical QA benchmarks show that SBU reduces traces of targeted private information across both pathways with limited degradation on retained data.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Across thirteen q-only benchmarks spanning mechanical, electrical, molecular, thermal, gravitational, and ecological systems, PHAST achieves the best long-horizon forecasting among competitive baselines and enables physically meaningful parameter recovery when the regime provides sufficient anchors.

However, their performance is constrained by the quality of the reference image, which limits real-world applications where ideal reference sources are unavailable.

Inspired by this biological memory mechanism, we propose a memory-driven quality-aware framework (MQAF), which establishes a memory bank for storing distortion patterns and dynamically switches between dual-mode quality assessment strategies to reduce reliance on high-quality reference images. When reference images are available, MQAF obtains reference-guided quality scores by adaptively weighting reference information and comparing the distorted image with stored distortion patterns in the memory bank. When the reference image is absent, the framework relies on distortion patterns in the memory bank to infer image quality, enabling no-reference quality assessment (NR-IQA).

This paper presents a case study of representative PTQ baselines applied to reasoning-oriented models such as DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen series (1.5B/7B/14B) and QwQ-32B. We evaluate four distinct algorithms, including AWQ, GPTQ, SmoothQuant, and FlatQuant, to cover the spectrum from weight-only compression to advanced rotation-based methods. Our empirical results reveal significant platform sensitivity. While 4-bit weight-only quantization proves viable for larger models, aggressive 4-bit weight-activation schemes suffer from layer-wise calibration instability on the NPU, leading to logic collapse in long-context reasoning tasks. Conversely, standard 8-bit quantization remains numerically stable. Furthermore, a real-world INT8 deployment demonstrates that although optimized kernels reduce latency, dynamic quantization overheads currently limit end-to-end acceleration.

Further, this paper contends that how to make the model efficiently align emotion conversion in semantics (named inter-emotion semantic conversion) and how to precisely retain emotion-agnostic contents (named exter-emotion semantic retaining) are rather important and challenging in this L-AVC task. To this end, this paper proposes an Efficient and Precise Emotion Manipulating approach for editing subjective emotions in images. Specifically, an Efficient Inter-emotion Converting (EIC) module is tailored to make the LLM efficiently align emotion conversion in semantics before and after editing, followed by a Precise Exter-emotion Retaining (PER) module to precisely retain the emotion-agnostic contents.

While decoding-time personalization offers a scalable alternative to training-time methods, existing methods largely rely on implicit, less interpretable preference representations and impose a rigid, context-agnostic user representation, failing to account for how preferences shift across prompts. We introduce EXACT, a new decoding-time personalization that aligns generation with limited pairwise preference feedback using a predefined set of interpretable attributes. EXACT first identifies user-specific attribute subsets by maximizing the likelihood of preferred responses in the offline stage. Then, for online inference, EXACT retrieves the most semantically relevant attributes for an incoming prompt and injects them into the context to steer generation. We establish theoretical approximation guarantees for the proposed algorithm under mild assumptions, and provably show that our similarity-based retrieval mechanism effectively mitigates contextual preference shifts, adapting to disparate tasks without pooling conflicting preferences. Extensive experiments on human-annotated preference datasets demonstrate that EXACT consistently outperforms strong baselines, including preference modeling accuracy and personalized generation quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Motivated by these gaps, this paper introduces a new chat paradigm SVU task, i.e., In-depth Security-oriented Video Understanding (DeepSVU), which aims to not only identify and locate the threats but also attribute and evaluate the causes threatening segments. Furthermore, this paper reveals two key challenges in the proposed task: 1) how to effectively model the coarse-to-fine physical-world information (e.g., human behavior, object interactions and background context) to boost the DeepSVU task; and 2) how to adaptively trade off these factors. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a new Unified Physical-world Regularized MoE (UPRM) approach. Specifically, UPRM incorporates two key components: the Unified Physical-world Enhanced MoE (UPE) Block and the Physical-world Trade-off Regularizer (PTR), to address the above two challenges, respectively. Extensive experiments conduct on our DeepSVU instructions datasets (i.e., UCF-C instructions and CUVA instructions) demonstrate that UPRM outperforms several advanced Video-LLMs as well as non-VLM approaches.

However, their substantial computational demands raise concerns about the energy efficiency and sustainability of both training and inference. Inference, in particular, dominates total compute usage, making its optimization crucial. Recent research has explored optimization techniques and analyzed how configuration choices influence energy consumption. Yet, the vast configuration space of inference servers makes exhaustive empirical evaluation infeasible due to combinatorial explosion. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective on this problem by treating LLMs as configurable systems and applying variability management techniques to systematically analyze inference-time configuration choices. We evaluate our approach on the Hugging Face Transformers library by representing generation hyperparameters and their constraints using a feature-based variability model, sampling representative configurations, measuring their energy consumption, latency, accuracy, and learning predictive models from the collected data. Our results show that variability modeling effectively manages the complexity of LLM inference configurations. It enables systematic analysis of hyperparameters effects and interactions, reveals trade-offs, and supports accurate prediction of inference behavior from a limited number of measurements.

Existing attention manipulation methods focus exclusively on the Key space to modulate attention routing, leaving the Value space -- which governs feature aggregation -- entirely unexploited. In this paper, we first reveal that both Key and Value projections in DiT's multi-modal attention layers exhibit a pronounced bias-delta structure, where token embeddings cluster tightly around a layer-specific bias vector. Building on this observation, we propose Dual-Channel Attention Guidance (DCAG), a training-free framework that simultaneously manipulates both the Key channel (controlling where to attend) and the Value channel (controlling what to aggregate). We provide a theoretical analysis showing that the Key channel operates through the nonlinear softmax function, acting as a coarse control knob, while the Value channel operates through linear weighted summation, serving as a fine-grained complement. Together, the two-dimensional parameter space $(\u03b4_k, \u03b4_v)$ enables more precise editing-fidelity trade-offs than any single-channel method.

However, such context provided by the action names is too limited to provide sufficient background knowledge for capturing novel spatial and temporal concepts in actions. In this paper, we propose DiST, an innovative Decomposition-incorporation framework for FSAR that makes use of decoupled Spatial and Temporal knowledge provided by large language models to learn expressive multi-granularity prototypes. In the decomposition stage, we decouple vanilla action names into diverse spatio-temporal attribute descriptions (action-related knowledge). Such commonsense knowledge complements semantic contexts from spatial and temporal perspectives. In the incorporation stage, we propose Spatial/Temporal Knowledge Compensators (SKC/TKC) to discover discriminative object-level and frame-level prototypes, respectively. In SKC, object-level prototypes adaptively aggregate important patch tokens under the guidance of spatial knowledge. Moreover, in TKC, frame-level prototypes utilize temporal attributes to assist in inter-frame temporal relation modeling. These learned prototypes thus provide transparency in capturing fine-grained spatial details and diverse temporal patterns. Experimental results show DiST achieves state-of-the-art results on five standard FSAR datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A dispersion-adaptive metric learner adjusts instance-level margins according to feature spread, increasing intra-class compactness. Spatially conditioned attention injects coarse geometry, such as GPS or deployment floor plans, into graph-based self-attention to enable projectively consistent cross-view alignment using only coarse geometric priors without requiring survey-grade calibration. Differentially private embedding maps are coupled with compact approximate indexes to support secure and cost-efficient deployment. Together these designs produce descriptors robust to viewpoint variation, occlusion, and domain shifts, and they enable a tunable balance between privacy and utility under rigorous differential-privacy accounting.

Traditional temporal diffusion models suffer from local entanglement and the $\\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ cost of attention mechanisms. We address these limitations by introducing PaCoDi (Parallel Complex Diffusion), a spectral-native architecture that decouples generative modeling in the frequency domain. PaCoDi fundamentally alters the problem topology: the Fourier Transform acts as a diagonalizing operator, converting locally coupled temporal signals into globally decorrelated spectral components. Theoretically, we prove the Quadrature Forward Diffusion and Conditional Reverse Factorization theorem, demonstrating that the complex diffusion process can be split into independent real and imaginary branches. We bridge the gap between this decoupled theory and data reality using a \\textbf{Mean Field Theory (MFT) approximation} reinforced by an interactive correction mechanism. Furthermore, we generalize this discrete DDPM to continuous-time Frequency SDEs, rigorously deriving the Spectral Wiener Process describe the differential spectral Brownian motion limit. Crucially, PaCoDi exploits the Hermitian Symmetry of real-valued signals to compress the sequence length by half, achieving a 50% reduction in attention FLOPs without information loss. We further derive a rigorous Heteroscedastic Loss to handle the non-isotropic noise distribution on the compressed manifold.

Focusing on linear self-attention Transformers, we derive a non-asymptotic bound linking adversarial perturbation strength ($\u03c1$), model capacity ($m$), and the number of in-context examples ($N$). The analysis reveals that model robustness scales with the square root of its capacity ($\u03c1_{\\text{max}} \\propto \\sqrt{m}$), while adversarial settings impose a sample complexity penalty proportional to the square of the perturbation magnitude ($N_\u03c1- N_0 \\propto \u03c1^2$).

We address this limitation with a two-phase training strategy for fine-grained road marking segmentation that removes full supervision during pretraining and halves the amount of training data during fine-tuning while still outperforming the comparable supervised baseline model. During the self-supervised pretraining, BEVFormer predictions are differentiably reprojected into the image plane and trained against multi-view semantic pseudo-labels generated by the widely used semantic segmentation model Mask2Former. A temporal loss encourages consistency across frames. The subsequent supervised fine-tuning phase requires only 50% of the dataset and significantly less training time. With our method, the fine-tuning benefits from rich priors learned during pretraining boosting the performance and BEV segmentation quality (up to +2.5pp mIoU over the fully supervised baseline) on nuScenes. It simultaneously halves the usage of annotation data and reduces total training time by up to two thirds. The results demonstrate that differentiable reprojection plus camera perspective pseudo labels yields transferable BEV features and a scalable path toward reduced-label autonomous perception.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, the investigation of machine learning predictions applied to prospectively collected, standardized data from observational clinical intervention trials remains underexplored, despite its potential to reduce costs and improve patient outcomes. Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), a persistent inflammatory disease of the paranasal sinuses lasting more than three months, imposes a substantial burden on quality of life (QoL) and societal cost. Although many patients respond to medical therapy, others with refractory symptoms often pursue surgical intervention. Surgical decision-making in CRS is complex, as it must weigh known procedural risks against uncertain individualized outcomes. In this study, we evaluated supervised machine learning models for predicting surgical benefit in CRS, using the Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22 (SNOT-22) as the primary patient-reported outcome. Our prospectively collected cohort from an observational intervention trial comprised patients who all underwent surgery; we investigated whether models trained only on preoperative data could identify patients who might not have been recommended surgery prior to the procedure. Across multiple algorithms, including an ensemble approach, our best model achieved approximately 85% classification accuracy, providing accurate and interpretable predictions of surgical candidacy. Moreover, on a held-out set of 30 cases spanning mixed difficulty, our model achieved 80% accuracy, exceeding the average prediction accuracy of expert clinicians (75.6%), demonstrating its potential to augment clinical decision-making and support personalized CRS care.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5229\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u6162\u6027\u9f3b-\u9f3b\u7aa6\u708e\uff08CRS\uff09\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u624b\u672f\u83b7\u76ca\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u672f\u524d\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ea685%\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9884\u7559\u768430\u4e2a\u75c5\u4f8b\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523080%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6162\u6027\u9f3b-\u9f3b\u7aa6\u708e\uff08CRS\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6301\u7eed\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u6708\u7684\u9f3b\u7aa6\u6162\u6027\u708e\u75c7\u6027\u75be\u75c5\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u60a3\u8005\u751f\u6d3b\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u5e26\u6765\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u6210\u672c\u3002\u867d\u7136\u8bb8\u591a\u60a3\u8005\u5bf9\u836f\u7269\u6cbb\u7597\u6709\u53cd\u5e94\uff0c\u4f46\u90e8\u5206\u96be\u6cbb\u6027\u75c7\u72b6\u60a3\u8005\u5e38\u9009\u62e9\u624b\u672f\u6cbb\u7597\u3002CRS\u624b\u672f\u51b3\u7b56\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u624b\u672f\u98ce\u9669\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u4e4b\u95f4\u6743\u8861\u3002\u76ee\u524d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bd5\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u9884\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u5c1a\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8fd9\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u964d\u4f4e\u533b\u7597\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u6539\u5584\u60a3\u8005\u7ed3\u5c40\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u89c2\u5bdf\u6027\u5e72\u9884\u8bd5\u9a8c\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u961f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u76d1\u7763\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9CRS\u624b\u672f\u83b7\u76ca\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u6240\u6709\u60a3\u8005\u5747\u63a5\u53d7\u4e86\u624b\u672f\u6cbb\u7597\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u672f\u524d\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5426\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u90a3\u4e9b\u5728\u672f\u524d\u53ef\u80fd\u4e0d\u88ab\u63a8\u8350\u624b\u672f\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5Sino-Nasal Outcome Test-22\uff08SNOT-22\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u60a3\u8005\u62a5\u544a\u7ed3\u5c40\u6307\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ea685%\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u624b\u672f\u5019\u9009\u8d44\u683c\u3002\u5728\u5305\u542b30\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u96be\u5ea6\u75c5\u4f8b\u7684\u9884\u7559\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u523080%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0875.6%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4bCRS\u624b\u672f\u83b7\u76ca\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5176\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e13\u5bb6\u5e73\u5747\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u589e\u5f3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316CRS\u62a4\u7406\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u533b\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing resources are limited in scale, focus primarily on isolated characters or short words, and lack controlled lexical content and writer level diversity, which restricts their utility for modern data driven handwriting analysis. As a result, they fail to capture the continuous, fused, and structurally complex nature of Devanagari handwriting, where characters are connected through a shared shirorekha (horizontal headline) and exhibit rich ligature formations. We introduce DohaScript, a large scale, multi writer dataset of handwritten Hindi text collected from 531 unique contributors. The dataset is designed as a parallel stylistic corpus, in which all writers transcribe the same fixed set of six traditional Hindi dohas (couplets). This controlled design enables systematic analysis of writer specific variation independent of linguistic content, and supports tasks such as handwriting recognition, writer identification, style analysis, and generative modeling. The dataset is accompanied by non identifiable demographic metadata, rigorous quality curation based on objective sharpness and resolution criteria, and page level layout difficulty annotations that facilitate stratified benchmarking. Baseline experiments demonstrate clear quality separation and strong generalization to unseen writers, highlighting the dataset's reliability and practical value. DohaScript is intended to serve as a standardized and reproducible benchmark for advancing research on continuous handwritten Devanagari text in low resource script settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We show that an adversary can systematically exploit clarification-seeking behavior$-$commonly encouraged in multi-turn conversation settings$-$to scalably prolong interactions. Moving beyond prompt-level behaviors, we take a mechanistic perspective and identify a query-independent, universal activation subspace associated with clarification-seeking responses. Unlike prior cost-amplification attacks that rely on per-turn prompt optimization, our attack arises from conversational dynamics and persists across prompts and tasks. We show that this mechanism provides a scalable pathway to induce turn amplification: both supply-chain attacks via fine-tuning and runtime attacks through low-level parameter corruptions consistently shift models toward abstract, clarification-seeking behavior across prompts. Across multiple instruction-tuned LLMs and benchmarks, our attack substantially increases turn count while remaining compliant.

Large language models (LLMs) can provide subgoal decompositions, plausible trajectories, and abstract priors that facilitate early learning. However, heavy reliance on LLM supervision introduces scalability constraints and dependence on potentially unreliable signals. We propose MIRA (Memory-Integrated Reinforcement Learning Agent), which incorporates a structured, evolving memory graph to guide early training. The graph stores decision-relevant information, including trajectory segments and subgoal structures, and is constructed from both the agent's high-return experiences and LLM outputs. This design amortizes LLM queries into a persistent memory rather than requiring continuous real-time supervision. From this memory graph, we derive a utility signal that softly adjusts advantage estimation to influence policy updates without modifying the underlying reward function. As training progresses, the agent's policy gradually surpasses the initial LLM-derived priors, and the utility term decays, preserving standard convergence guarantees. We provide theoretical analysis showing that utility-based shaping improves early-stage learning in sparse-reward environments. Empirically, MIRA outperforms RL baselines and achieves returns comparable to approaches that rely on frequent LLM supervision, while requiring substantially fewer online LLM queries.

We employ classical linear multistep methods to forecast future model outputs from historical information, combined with a corrector that activates in high-dynamics regions to prevent error accumulation. A dynamic step modulation mechanism adaptively adjusts the prediction horizon by monitoring the feature change rate.

OODBench contains 40K instance-level OOD instance-category pairs, and we show that current VLMs still exhibit notable performance degradation on OODBench, even when the underlying image categories are common.

This construction yields a single, interpretable knob -- the concentration matrix $\u039b$ -- that continuously controls routing entropy, replacing discrete top-$k$ selection with a smooth, geometrically principled sparsity mechanism. We further develop an amortized variational inference procedure for posterior routing distributions, enabling uncertainty-aware expert assignment that naturally resists expert collapse. We formally prove tight bounds relating the Bingham concentration spectrum to routing entropy, expected top-$k$ mass, and an exponential bound on expert collapse, establishing the first formal theory of concentration-controlled sparsity.

In this work, we investigate the performance of ViTs in elementary visual judgment tasks inspired by the foundational studies of Cleveland and McGill, which quantified the accuracy of human perception across different visual encodings.

We introduce Stiefel-Bayes Adapters (SBA), a Bayesian PEFT framework that places a Matrix Langevin prior over orthonormal adapter factors on the Stiefel manifold $\\St$ and performs approximate posterior inference via tangent space Laplace approximation with geodesic retraction. Unlike Gaussian priors in flat space projected onto orthogonality constraints, our prior on the manifold naturally encodes the inductive bias that adapter subspaces should be well conditioned and orthogonal, while the posterior provides calibrated predictive uncertainty without recalibration. We prove formally that the tangent space approximation strictly avoids the structural variance inflation inherent in projecting from ambient space, establishing a rigorous theoretical advantage for intrinsic manifold inference. Across GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks on RoBERTa-large, LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-2-13B, Mistral-7B, and Qwen2.5-7B, domain shift evaluations, selective prediction protocols, and an abstractive summarization task, SBA achieves task performance comparable to LoRA and DoRA while reducing Expected Calibration Error by 18 to 34\\% over deterministic baselines, improving selective prediction AUROC by 12 to 25\\% under domain shift, and outperforming deep ensembles of five LoRA models on OOD detection at a fraction of the parameter cost.

Organizations regularly use graph data to solve complex problems involving relationships and connections. Causal learning is especially important in this context, since it helps to understand cause-effect relationships rather than mere associations. Since many real-world systems are inherently causal, graphs can efficiently model these systems. However, traditional graph machine learning methods including graph neural networks (GNNs), rely on correlations and are sensitive to spurious patterns and distribution changes. On the other hand, causal models enable robust predictions by isolating true causal factors, thus making them more stable under such shifts. Causal learning also helps in identifying and adjusting for confounders, ensuring that predictions reflect true causal relationships and remain accurate even under interventions. To address these challenges and build models that are robust and causally informed, we propose CCAGNN, a Confounder-Aware causal GNN framework that incorporates causal reasoning into graph learning, supporting counterfactual reasoning and providing reliable predictions in real-world settings. Comprehensive experiments on six publicly available datasets from diverse domains show that CCAGNN consistently outperforms leading state-of-the-art models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we introduce the Distortion-aware Motion Calibrator (DMC), a post-hoc module that refines physically implausible motions (e.g., foot floating) while preserving semantic consistency with the original textual description. Rather than relying on complex physical modeling, we propose a self-supervised and data-driven approach, whereby DMC learns to obtain physically plausible motions when an intentionally distorted motion and the original textual descriptions are given as inputs. We evaluate DMC as a post-hoc module to improve motions obtained from various text-to-motion generation models and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving physical plausibility while enhancing semantic consistency.

Traditional approaches often fail to produce generalized and interpretable explanations, as multiple distinct input trajectories may yield nearly indistinguishable outputs. In this work, we present ruleXplain, a framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract formal explanations for input-output relations in simulation-driven dynamical systems. Our method introduces a constrained symbolic rule language with temporal operators and delay semantics, enabling LLMs to generate verifiable causal rules through structured prompting. ruleXplain relies on the availability of a principled model (e.g., a simulator) that maps multivariate input time series to output time series. Within ruleXplain, the simulator is used to generate diverse counterfactual input trajectories that yield similar target output, serving as candidate explanations. Such counterfactual inputs are clustered and provided as context to the LLM, which is tasked with the generation of symbolic rules encoding the joint temporal trends responsible for the patterns observable in the output times series. A closed-loop refinement process ensures rule consistency and semantic validity. We validate the framework using the PySIRTEM epidemic simulator, mapping testing rate inputs to daily infection counts; and the EnergyPlus building energy simulator, observing temperature and solar irradiance inputs to electricity needs. For validation, we perform three classes of experiments: (1) the efficacy of the ruleset through input reconstruction; (2) ablation studies evaluating the causal encoding of the ruleset; and (3) generalization tests of the extracted rules across unseen output trends with varying phase dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Ours being the first work studying this topic, we first formulate attacks that aim to perturb the features extracted by discrete tokenizers, and thus change the extracted tokens. These attacks are computationally efficient, application-agnostic, and effective across classification, multimodal retrieval, and captioning tasks. Second, to defend against this vulnerability, inspired by recent work on robust CLIP encoders, we fine-tune popular tokenizers with unsupervised adversarial training, keeping all other components frozen. While unsupervised and task-agnostic, our approach significantly improves robustness to both unsupervised and end-to-end supervised attacks and generalizes well to unseen tasks and data. Unlike supervised adversarial training, our approach can leverage unlabeled images, making it more versatile.

Although this has led to significant progress in domains such as robotics, healthcare, and finance, the use of RL in practice is challenging, particularly when learning decision policies in high-stakes applications that may require guarantees. Traditional RL algorithms rely on a large number of online interactions with the environment, which is problematic in scenarios where online interactions are costly, dangerous, or infeasible. However, learning from offline datasets is hindered by the presence of hidden confounders. Such confounders can cause spurious correlations in the dataset and can mislead the agent into taking suboptimal or adversarial actions. Firstly, we address the problem of learning from offline datasets in the presence of hidden confounders. We work with instrumental variables (IVs) to identify the causal effect, which is an instance of a conditional moment restrictions (CMR) problem. Inspired by double/debiased machine learning, we derive a sample-efficient algorithm for solving CMR problems with convergence and optimality guarantees, which outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms. Secondly, we relax the conditions on the hidden confounders in the setting of (offline) imitation learning, and adapt our CMR estimator to derive an algorithm that can learn effective imitator policies with convergence rate guarantees. Finally, we consider the problem of learning high-level objectives expressed in linear temporal logic (LTL) and develop a provably optimal learning algorithm that improves sample efficiency over existing methods. Through evaluation on reinforcement learning benchmarks and synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets, we demonstrate the usefulness of the methods developed in this thesis in real-world decision making.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Gradient-based data selection methods such as TracIn and Influence Functions leverage influence to identify useful samples, but their computational cost scales poorly, making them impractical for multi-billion-parameter large language models (LLMs). A common alternative is to use off-the-shelf smaller models as proxies, but they remain suboptimal since their learning dynamics are unclear, their sizes cannot be flexibly adjusted, and they cannot be further aligned with the target model in terms of gradient-based influence estimation. To address these challenges, we introduce Iprox, a two-stage framework that derives influence-preserving proxies directly from the target model. It first applies a low-rank compression stage to preserve influence information of the target model, and then an aligning stage to align both model gradients and logits, thereby constructing proxies that flexibly control computational cost while retaining the target model's influence. Experimental results across diverse LLM families and evaluation tasks show that Iprox consistently outperforms off-the-shelf proxies and baseline methods. On Qwen3-4B, a 1.5B proxy constructed with Iprox achieves stronger performance than the larger 1.7B off-the-shelf proxy. Notably, on Llama3.2, Iprox achieves better performance than baselines while reducing computational cost by more than half relative to the full 3B model.

Effectively combining textual and visual modalities requires adherence to the sketch visual structure when leveraging the guidance of localized attributes from text. We present LOcalized Text and Sketch with multi-level guidance (LOTS), a framework that enhances fashion image generation by combining global sketch guidance with multiple localized sketch-text pairs. LOTS employs a Multi-level Conditioning Stage to independently encode local features within a shared latent space while maintaining global structural coordination. Then, the Diffusion Pair Guidance stage integrates both local and global conditioning via attention-based guidance within the diffusion model's multi-step denoising process. To validate our method, we develop Sketchy, the first fashion dataset where multiple text-sketch pairs are provided per image. Sketchy provides high-quality, clean sketches with a professional look and consistent structure.

Understanding the mechanisms governing when memorization versus generalization occurs remains an active area of research. In particular, it is unclear where along the noise schedule memorization is induced, how data geometry influences it, and how phenomena at different noise scales interact. We introduce a geometric framework that partitions the noise schedule into three regimes based on the coverage properties of training data by Gaussian shells and the concentration behavior of the posterior, which we argue are two fundamental objects governing memorization and generalization in diffusion models. This perspective reveals that memorization risk is highly non-uniform across noise levels. We further identify a danger zone at medium noise levels where memorization is most pronounced. In contrast, both the small and large noise regimes resist memorization, but through fundamentally different mechanisms: small noise avoids memorization due to limited training coverage, while large noise exhibits low posterior concentration and admits a provably near linear Gaussian denoising behavior. For the medium noise regime, we identify geometric conditions through which we propose a geometry-informed targeted intervention that mitigates memorization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u8c03\u5ea6\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u8bb0\u5fc6\u98ce\u9669\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0a\u7684\u975e\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u8bb0\u5fc6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6837\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7406\u89e3\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u673a\u5236\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6d3b\u8dc3\u7814\u7a76\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u8c03\u5ea6\u4e2d\u4f55\u65f6\u53d1\u751f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3001\u6570\u636e\u51e0\u4f55\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\u5982\u4f55\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u58f3\u8986\u76d6\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7279\u6027\u548c\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u96c6\u4e2d\u884c\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u63a7\u5236\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u5c06\u566a\u58f0\u8c03\u5ea6\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u533a\u57df\u3002\u5728\u4e2d\u566a\u58f0\u533a\u57df\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u8bb0\u5fc6\u98ce\u9669\u6700\u5927\u7684\"\u5371\u9669\u533a\"\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u51e0\u4f55\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u98ce\u9669\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0a\u9ad8\u5ea6\u975e\u5747\u5300\uff0c\u4e2d\u566a\u58f0\u533a\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6700\u663e\u8457\u7684\"\u5371\u9669\u533a\"\uff0c\u800c\u5c0f\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5927\u566a\u58f0\u533a\u57df\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u673a\u5236\u62b5\u6297\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff1a\u5c0f\u566a\u58f0\u533a\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u8986\u76d6\u6709\u9650\u800c\u907f\u514d\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u5927\u566a\u58f0\u533a\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u4f4e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u8fd1\u7ebf\u6027\u9ad8\u65af\u53bb\u566a\u884c\u4e3a\u62b5\u6297\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u7f13\u89e3\u8bb0\u5fc6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u673a\u5236\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u5bc6\u5207\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u89e3\u566a\u58f0\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u533a\u6765\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u9690\u79c1\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

Recent methods achieve dense reconstructions from da Vinci robotic surgery videos, with Gaussian Splatting (GS) offering real-time performance via graphics acceleration. However, reconstruction quality in occluded regions remains limited, and depth accuracy has not been fully assessed, as benchmarks like EndoNeRF and StereoMIS lack 3D ground truth. We propose Diff2DGS, a novel two-stage framework for reliable 3D reconstruction of occluded surgical scenes. In the first stage, a diffusion-based video module with temporal priors inpaints tissue occluded by instruments with high spatial-temporal consistency. In the second stage, we adapt 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with a Learnable Deformation Model (LDM) to capture dynamic tissue deformation and anatomical geometry. We also extend evaluation beyond prior image-quality metrics by performing quantitative depth accuracy analysis on the SCARED dataset. Diff2DGS outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both appearance and geometry, reaching 38.02 dB PSNR on EndoNeRF and 34.40 dB on StereoMIS. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate that optimizing for image quality alone does not necessarily translate into optimal 3D reconstruction accuracy. To address this, we further optimize the depth quality of the reconstructed 3D results, ensuring more faithful geometry in addition to high-fidelity appearance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this gap, we introduce the Neural-Integrated Mechanistic Modeling (NIMM) evaluation framework, which evaluates LLM-generated mechanistic models under realistic settings with partial observations and diversified task objectives. Our evaluation reveals fundamental challenges in current baselines, ranging from model effectiveness to code-level correctness. Motivated by these findings, we design NIMMgen, an agentic framework for neural-integrated mechanistic modeling that enhances code correctness and practical validity through iterative refinement.

We propose Luminance-GS++, a 3DGS-based framework for robust NVS under diverse illumination conditions.

The proposed method not only uses the flow model for actor as in previous flow policies but also exploits the expressive flow model for conservative critic acquisition to prevent Q-value explosion in out-of-data regions. To this end, we propose a new form of critic regularizer based on the flow behavior proxy model obtained as a byproduct of flow-based actor design.

An alternative family of architectures proposes to earn equivariant operators in a latent space from examples of symmetric transformations. Here, using simple datasets of rotated and translated noisy MNIST, we illustrate how such architectures can successfully be harnessed for out-of-distribution classification, thus overcoming the limitations of both traditional and equivariant networks.

Furthermore, existing prompt optimization techniques are poorly suited to this domain, which is highly prone to local minima. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ADAPT, a hybrid method combining beam search initialization with adaptive gradient-guided mutation, designed around these failure modes. We evaluate on Sparse Autoencoder latents from Gemma 2 2B, proposing metrics grounded in dataset activation statistics to enable rigorous comparison, and show that ADAPT consistently outperforms prior methods across layers and latent types.

A common problem is reward hacking, where the policy may exploit inaccuracies of the reward and learn an unintended behavior. Most previous works address this by limiting the policy update with a Kullback-Leibler (KL) penalty towards a reference model. We propose a different framing: Train the LM in a way that biases policy updates towards regions in which the reward is more accurate. First, we derive a theoretical connection between the accuracy of a reward model and the flatness of an optimum at convergence. Gradient regularization (GR) can then be used to bias training to flatter regions and thereby maintain reward model accuracy. We confirm these results by showing that the gradient norm and reward accuracy are empirically correlated in RLHF. We then show that Reference Resets of the KL penalty implicitly use GR to find flatter regions with higher reward accuracy. We further improve on this by proposing to use explicit GR with an efficient finite-difference estimate. Empirically, GR performs better than a KL penalty across a diverse set of RL experiments with LMs. GR achieves a higher GPT-judged win-rate in RLHF, avoids overly focusing on the format in rule-based math rewards, and prevents hacking the judge in LLM-as-a-Judge math tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, real-world navigation is inherently conditioned by the agent's mobility constraints. For example, a sweeping robot cannot traverse stairs, while a quadruped can. We introduce Capability-Conditioned Navigation (CapNav), a benchmark designed to evaluate how well VLMs can navigate complex indoor spaces given an agent's specific physical and operational capabilities. CapNav defines five representative human and robot agents, each described with physical dimensions, mobility capabilities, and environmental interaction abilities. CapNav provides 45 real-world indoor scenes, 473 navigation tasks, and 2365 QA pairs to test if VLMs can traverse indoor environments based on agent capabilities. We evaluate 13 modern VLMs and find that current VLM's navigation performance drops sharply as mobility constraints tighten, and that even state-of-the-art models struggle with obstacle types that require reasoning on spatial dimensions. We conclude by discussing the implications for capability-aware navigation and the opportunities for advancing embodied spatial reasoning in future VLMs. The benchmark is available at https://github.com/makeabilitylab/CapNav", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aCapNav\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8003\u8651\u7279\u5b9a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7269\u7406\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u4e25\u683c\u79fb\u52a8\u7ea6\u675f\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f88\u5c11\u8003\u8651\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u7269\u7406\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u80fd\u529b\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u51b3\u7b56\u5fc5\u987b\u8003\u8651\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\uff0c\u626b\u5730\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4e0d\u80fd\u722c\u697c\u68af\uff0c\u800c\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53ef\u4ee5\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u80fd\u529b\u6761\u4ef6\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Capability-Conditioned Navigation (CapNav)\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e865\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u7269\u7406\u5c3a\u5bf8\u3001\u79fb\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u5305\u542b45\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\u3001473\u4e2a\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u548c2365\u4e2a\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8613\u4e2a\u73b0\u4ee3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u7740\u79fb\u52a8\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6536\u7d27\u800c\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u662fstate-of-the-art\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9700\u8981\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u969c\u788d\u7269\u7c7b\u578b\u65f6\u4e5f\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u80fd\u529b\u611f\u77e5\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u672a\u6765\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5177\u8eab\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u673a\u4f1a\u3002\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Current methods lack this spatial awareness. We close this gap with the first real-time, fully causal method for spatially-aware conversational motion, deployable on a streaming VR headset. Given a user's position and dyadic audio, our approach produces full-body motion that aligns gestures with speech while orienting the agent according to the user. Our architecture combines a causal transformer-based VAE with interleaved latent tokens for streaming inference and a flow matching model conditioned on user trajectory and audio. To support varying gaze preferences, we introduce a gaze scoring mechanism with classifier-free guidance to decouple learning from control: the model captures natural spatial alignment from data, while users can adjust eye contact intensity at inference time. On the Embody 3D dataset, our method achieves state-of-the-art motion quality at over 300 FPS -- 3x faster than non-causal baselines -- while capturing the subtle spatial dynamics of natural conversation.

We formalize both as orthogonal operators and show that, within a rank distance of one, folding provably yields smaller parameter reconstruction error, and under mild smoothness assumptions, smaller functional perturbations than pruning. At scale, we evaluate >1000 checkpoints spanning ResNet18, PreActResNet18, ViT-B/32, and CLIP ViT-B/32 on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K, covering diverse training hyperparameters (optimizers, learning rates, augmentations, regularization, sharpness-aware training), as well as multiple LLaMA-family 60M and 130M parameter models trained on C4.

A common but poorly understood phenomenon during training is the PCC plateau: PCC stops improving early in training, even as MSE continues to decrease. We provide the first rigorous theoretical analysis of this behavior, revealing fundamental limitations in both optimization dynamics and model capacity. First, in regard to the flattened PCC curve, we uncover a critical conflict where lowering MSE (magnitude matching) can paradoxically suppress the PCC gradient (shape matching). This issue is exacerbated by the softmax attention mechanism, particularly when the data to be aggregated is highly homogeneous. Second, we identify a limitation in the model capacity: we derived a PCC improvement limit for any convex aggregator (including the softmax attention), showing that the convex hull of the inputs strictly bounds the achievable PCC gain. We demonstrate that data homogeneity intensifies both limitations. Motivated by these insights, we propose the Extrapolative Correlation Attention (ECA), which incorporates novel, theoretically-motivated mechanisms to improve the PCC optimization and extrapolate beyond the convex hull. Across diverse benchmarks, including challenging homogeneous data setting, ECA consistently breaks the PCC plateau, achieving significant improvements in correlation without compromising MSE performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While they have shown strong performance in offline RL, particularly where the target distribution is well defined, their extension to online fine-tuning has largely been treated as a direct continuation of offline pre-training, leaving key challenges unaddressed. In this paper, we propose Flow Matching with Injected Noise for Offline-to-Online RL (FINO), a novel method that leverages flow matching-based policies to enhance sample efficiency for offline-to-online RL.

Extended version", "summary": "We study a sequential prediction problem in which an adversary is allowed to inject arbitrarily many adversarial instances in a stream of i.i.d.\\ instances, but at each round, the learner may also \\emph{abstain} from making a prediction without incurring any penalty if the instance was indeed corrupted. This semi-adversarial setting naturally sits between the classical stochastic case with i.i.d.\\ instances for which function classes with finite VC dimension are learnable; and the adversarial case with arbitrary instances, known to be significantly more restrictive. For this problem, Goel et al. (2023) showed that, if the learner knows the distribution $\u03bc$ of clean samples in advance, learning can be achieved for all VC classes without restrictions on adversary corruptions. This is, however, a strong assumption in both theory and practice: a natural question is whether similar learning guarantees can be achieved without prior distributional knowledge, as is standard in classical learning frameworks (e.g., PAC learning or asymptotic consistency) and other non-i.i.d.\\ models (e.g., smoothed online learning). We therefore focus on the distribution-free setting where $\u03bc$ is \\emph{unknown} and propose an algorithm \\textsc{AbstainBoost} based on a boosting procedure of weak learners, which guarantees sublinear error for general VC classes in \\emph{distribution-free} abstention learning for oblivious adversaries. These algorithms also enjoy similar guarantees for adaptive adversaries, for structured function classes including linear classifiers. These results are complemented with corresponding lower bounds, which reveal an interesting polynomial trade-off between misclassification error and number of erroneous abstentions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u5141\u8bb8\u5bf9\u624b\u6ce8\u5165\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u65f6\u9009\u62e9\u5f03\u6743\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u5e72\u51c0\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u5426\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0VC\u7c7b\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u5047\u8bbe\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u5df2\u77e5\u5e72\u51c0\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5e03\u03bc\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u90fd\u662f\u5f3a\u5047\u8bbe\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u5148\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u80fd\u5426\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u8fd9\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u7ecf\u5178\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u5982PAC\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u975e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f31\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u63d0\u5347\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5AbstainBoost\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5f03\u6743\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u4e00\u822cVC\u7c7b\u5728\u975e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5bf9\u624b\u4e0b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5bf9\u624b\u4e0b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\uff08\u5982\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u65e0\u5173\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5bf9\u4e00\u822cVC\u7c7b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6b21\u7ebf\u6027\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9488\u5bf9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5bf9\u624b\u4e0b\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u4e5f\u6709\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u9519\u8bef\u4e0e\u9519\u8bef\u5f03\u6743\u6b21\u6570\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u5e72\u51c0\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u5f03\u6743\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4ecd\u7136\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0VC\u7c7b\u7684\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u975e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5bf9\u624b\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u5bf9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5bf9\u624b\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u51fd\u6570\u7c7b\u4e0a\u4e5f\u6709\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e3a\u534a\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Yet propensities - the tendencies of models to exhibit particular behaviours - play a central role in determining both performance and safety outcomes. However, traditional IRT describes a model's success on a task as a monotonic function of model capabilities and task demands, an approach unsuited to propensities, where both excess and deficiency can be problematic. Here, we introduce the first formal framework for measuring AI propensities by using a bilogistic formulation for model success, which attributes high success probability when the model's propensity is within an \"ideal band\". Further, we estimate the limits of the ideal band using LLMs equipped with newly developed task-agnostic rubrics. Applying our framework to six families of LLM models whose propensities are incited in either direction, we find that we can measure how much the propensity is shifted and what effect this has on the tasks. Critically, propensities estimated using one benchmark successfully predict behaviour on held-out tasks. Moreover, we obtain stronger predictive power when combining propensities and capabilities than either separately. More broadly, our framework showcases how rigorous propensity measurements can be conducted and how it yields gains over solely using capability evaluations to predict AI behaviour.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address these limitations, we propose LERD, an end-to-end Bayesian electrophysiological neural dynamical system that infers latent neural events and their relational structure directly from multichannel EEG without event or interaction annotations. LERD combines a continuous-time event inference module with a stochastic event-generation process to capture flexible temporal patterns, while incorporating an electrophysiology-inspired dynamical prior to guide learning in a principled way. We further provide theoretical analysis that yields a tractable bound for training and stability guarantees for the inferred relational dynamics.

Furthermore, we identify limitations in the experimental setup, particularly in information leakage detection and thoroughness of the ablation study. By examining and analyzing the behavior of a wider range of models on an extended version of the benchmark, we reveal insights that provide additional context to potential users. Our results highlight the importance of context in model-comparative evaluations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Nevertheless, previous theoretical works mainly focus on reducing the gap between the estimation and ground-truth (i.e., the bias), while ignoring the error due to data distribution (i.e., the variance), which degrades performance. To address this issue, we conduct a bias-variance decomposition for hypergradient estimation error and provide a supplemental detailed analysis of the variance term ignored by previous works. We also present a comprehensive analysis of the error bounds for hypergradient estimation. This facilitates an easy explanation of some phenomena commonly observed in practice, like overfitting to the validation set. Inspired by the derived theories, we propose an ensemble hypergradient strategy to reduce the variance in HPO algorithms effectively. Experimental results on tasks including regularization hyperparameter learning, data hyper-cleaning, and few-shot learning demonstrate that our variance reduction strategy improves hypergradient estimation.

In this work, we utilize Symmetry-Breaking Dimensional Expansion (SBDE) as a controlled probe to investigate the mechanism underlying this trade-off. SBDE expands input images by inserting constant-valued pixels, which breaks translational symmetry and consistently improves clean accuracy (e.g., from $90.47\\%$ to $95.63\\%$ on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-18) by reducing parameter degeneracy. However, this accuracy gain comes at the cost of reduced robustness against iterative white-box attacks. By employing a test-time \\emph{mask projection} that resets the inserted auxiliary pixels to their training values, we demonstrate that the vulnerability stems almost entirely from the inserted dimensions. The projection effectively neutralizes the attacks and restores robustness, revealing that the model achieves high accuracy by creating \\emph{sharp boundaries} (steep loss gradients) specifically along the auxiliary axes. Our findings provide a concrete geometric explanation for the accuracy-robustness paradox: the optimization landscape deepens the basin of attraction to improve accuracy but inevitably erects steep walls along the auxiliary degrees of freedom, creating a fragile sensitivity to off-manifold perturbations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While these innovations yield significant performance gains, they compromise the identity mapping property of residual connections, leading to training instability, limited scalability, and increased memory overhead. To address these challenges, we propose JPmHC (Jacobian-spectrum Preserving manifold-constrained Hyper-Connections), a framework that replaces identity skips with a trainable linear mixer acting on n parallel streams while explicitly controlling gradient conditioning. By constraining the mixer M on operator-norm-bounded manifolds (e.g., bistochastic, Stiefel, Grassmann), JPmHC prevents gradient pathologies and enhances stability. JPmHC introduces three key contributions: (i) a free-probability analysis that predicts Jacobian spectra for structured skips, providing actionable design rules for mixer selection; (ii) memory-efficient implicit differentiation for fixed-point projections, reducing activation memory and synchronization overhead; and (iii) a Stiefel-constrained mixer via Cayley transforms, ensuring orthogonality without post-hoc normalization. Empirical evaluations on ARC-AGI demonstrate that JPmHC achieves faster convergence, higher accuracy, and lower computational cost compared to bistochastic baselines.

This paper introduces Federated Zero Mean Gradients (FedZMG), a novel, parameter-free, client-side optimization algorithm designed to tackle client-drift by structurally regularizing the optimization space. Advancing the idea of Gradient Centralization, FedZMG projects local gradients onto a zero-mean hyperplane, effectively neutralizing the \"intensity\" or \"bias\" shifts inherent in heterogeneous data distributions without requiring additional communication or hyperparameter tuning. A theoretical analysis is provided, proving that FedZMG reduces the effective gradient variance and guarantees tighter convergence bounds compared to standard FedAvg.

It highly impacts learning outcomes and deepens inequities in education. While subsidy programs that transfer students from public to private schools offer a mechanism to alleviate congestion without capital-intensive construction, they often underperform due to fragmented data systems that hinder effective implementation. The Philippine Educational Service Contracting program, one of the world's largest educational subsidy programs, exemplifies these challenges, falling short of its goal to decongest public schools. This prevents the science-based and data-driven analyses needed to understand what shapes student enrollment flows, particularly how families respond to economic incentives and spatial constraints. We introduce a computational framework for modeling student flow patterns and simulating policy scenarios. By synthesizing heterogeneous government data across nearly 3,000 institutions, we employ a stochastic gravity model estimated via negative binomial regression to derive behavioral elasticities for distance, net tuition cost, and socioeconomic determinants. These elasticities inform a doubly constrained spatial allocation mechanism that simulates student redistribution under varying subsidy amounts while respecting both origin candidate pools and destination slot capacities. We find that geographic proximity constrains school choice four times more strongly than tuition cost and that slot capacity, not subsidy amounts, is the binding constraint. Our work demonstrates that subsidy programs alone cannot resolve systemic overcrowding, and computational modeling can empower education policymakers to make equitable, data-driven decisions by revealing the structural constraints that shape effective resource allocation, even when resources are limited.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

With the success of neural networks on such large-scale problems, more research in machine learning is being conducted now than ever before. This dissertation focuses on three different projects rooted in mathematical theory for machine learning applications.\n  The first project deals with supervised learning and manifold learning. In theory, one of the main problems in supervised learning is that of function approximation: that is, given some data set $\\mathcal{D}=\\{(x_j,f(x_j))\\}_{j=1}^M$, can one build a model $F\\approx f$? We introduce a method which aims to remedy several of the theoretical shortcomings of the current paradigm for supervised learning.\n  The second project deals with transfer learning, which is the study of how an approximation process or model learned on one domain can be leveraged to improve the approximation on another domain. We study such liftings of functions when the data is assumed to be known only on a part of the whole domain. We are interested in determining subsets of the target data space on which the lifting can be defined, and how the local smoothness of the function and its lifting are related.\n  The third project is concerned with the classification task in machine learning, particularly in the active learning paradigm. Classification has often been treated as an approximation problem as well, but we propose an alternative approach leveraging techniques originally introduced for signal separation problems. We introduce theory to unify signal separation with classification and a new algorithm which yields competitive accuracy to other recent active learning algorithms while providing results much faster.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We investigate using the exact neural architecture of an adult fruit fly's brain for the control of its body movement. We develop Fly-connectomic Graph Model (FlyGM), whose static structure is identical to the complete connectome of an adult Drosophila for whole-body locomotion control. To perform dynamical control, FlyGM represents the static connectome as a directed message-passing graph to impose a biologically grounded information flow from sensory inputs to motor outputs. Integrated with a biomechanical fruit fly model, our method achieves stable control across diverse locomotion tasks without task-specific architectural tuning. To verify the structural advantages of the connectome-based model, we compare it against a degree-preserving rewired graph, a random graph, and multilayer perceptrons, showing that FlyGM yields higher sample efficiency and superior performance. This work demonstrates that static brain connectomes can be transformed to instantiate effective neural policy for embodied learning of movement control.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although exhibiting strong instantaneous learning and generalization capabilities, Dual-to-Dual MLLMs still remain deficient in lifelong evolution, significantly affecting continual adaptation to dynamic real-world scenarios. One of the challenges is that learning new tasks inevitably destroys the learned knowledge. Beyond traditional catastrophic forgetting, Dual-to-Dual MLLMs face other challenges, including hallucination, instruction unfollowing, and failures in cross-modal knowledge transfer. However, no standardized continual learning framework for Dual-to-Dual MLLMs has been established yet, leaving these challenges unexplored. Thus, in this paper, we establish Continual-NExT, a continual learning framework for Dual-to-Dual MLLMs with deliberately-architected evaluation metrics. To improve the continual learning capability of Dual-to-Dual MLLMs, we propose an efficient MAGE (Mixture and Aggregation of General LoRA and Expert LoRA) method to further facilitate knowledge transfer across modalities and mitigate forgetting.

However, strict equivariance can increase computational cost due to added architectural constraints, and can slow down convergence because the model must be consistent across a large space of possible node permutations. We study this trade-off for graph generative models. Specifically, we start from an equivariant discrete flow-matching model, and relax its equivariance during training via a controllable symmetry modulation scheme based on sinusoidal positional encodings and node permutations. Experiments first show that symmetry-breaking can accelerate early training by providing an easier learning signal, but at the expense of encouraging shortcut solutions that can cause overfitting, where the model repeatedly generates graphs that are duplicates of the training set. On the contrary, properly modulating the symmetry signal can delay overfitting while accelerating convergence, allowing the model to reach stronger performance with $19\\%$ of the baseline training epochs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this problem, a decision-maker must allocate multiple types of resources to sequentially arriving queries over a finite horizon. Each query belongs to a finite set of types with fixed resource consumption and a stochastic reward drawn from an unknown, type-specific distribution. Critically, the environment exhibits arbitrary non-stationarity -- arrival distributions may shift unpredictably-while the algorithm requires only one historical sample per period to operate effectively. We distinguish two settings based on sample informativeness: (i) reward-observed samples containing both query type and reward realization, and (ii) the more challenging type-only samples revealing only query type information.\n  We propose a novel type-dependent quantile-based meta-policy that decouples the problem into modular components: reward distribution estimation, optimization of target service probabilities via fluid relaxation, and real-time decisions through dynamic acceptance thresholds. For reward-observed samples, our static threshold policy achieves $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret. For type-only samples, we first establish that sublinear regret is impossible without additional structure; under a mild minimum-arrival-probability assumption, we design both a partially adaptive policy attaining the same $\\tilde{O}({T})$ bound and, more significantly, a fully adaptive resolving policy with careful rounding that achieves the first poly-logarithmic regret guarantee of $O((\\log T)^3)$ for non-stationary multi-resource allocation.

Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) remains the dominant method for training RNNs, but its non-local computation, lack of spatial parallelism, and requirement to store extensive activation histories results in significant energy consumption. This work introduces a novel method combining Temporal Predictive Coding (tPC) with approximate Real-Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL), enabling effective spatio-temporal credit assignment. Results indicate that the proposed method can closely match the performance of BPTT on both synthetic benchmarks and real-world tasks. On a challenging machine translation task, with a 15-million parameter model, the proposed method achieves a test perplexity of 7.62 (vs. 7.49 for BPTT), marking one of the first applications of tPC to tasks of this scale. These findings demonstrate the potential of this method to learn complex temporal dependencies whilst retaining the local, parallelisable, and flexible properties of the original PC framework, paving the way for more energy-efficient learning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This operator has a well-behaved spectral decomposition and acts as a drop-in replacement for standard Laplacians in spectral GNNs. Building on this insight, we develop mu-ChebNet, a spectral architecture that jointly learns the potential and Chebyshev filters, effectively bridging message-passing adaptivity and spectral efficiency. Our theoretical analysis shows how the potential modulates the spectrum, enabling control of key graph properties. Empirically, mu-ChebNet delivers consistent gains on synthetic long-range reasoning tasks, as well as real-world benchmarks, while offering an interpretable routing field that reveals how information flows through the graph.

Prior studies have examined these explanations in different contexts, such as non-probabilistic versus probabilistic frameworks and local versus global settings. In this study, we introduce a unified framework for analyzing these explanations, demonstrating that they can all be characterized through the minimization of a unified probabilistic value function. We then prove that the complexity of these computations is influenced by three key properties of the value function: (1) *monotonicity*, (2) *submodularity*, and (3) *supermodularity* - which are three fundamental properties in *combinatorial optimization*. Our findings uncover some counterintuitive results regarding the nature of these properties within the explanation settings examined. For instance, although the *local* value functions do not exhibit monotonicity or submodularity/supermodularity whatsoever, we demonstrate that the *global* value functions do possess these properties. This distinction enables us to prove a series of novel polynomial-time results for computing various explanations with provable guarantees in the global explainability setting, across a range of ML models that span the interpretability spectrum, such as neural networks, decision trees, and tree ensembles. In contrast, we show that even highly simplified versions of these explanations become NP-hard to compute in the corresponding local explainability setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While machine learning-based surrogate models offer fast inference as a promising alternative, they suffer from degraded accuracy, particularly evaluated on complex urban layouts or out-of-distribution scenarios. Moreover, autoregressive prediction strategies in such models are prone to error accumulation over long forecasting horizons, limiting their robustness for extended-time simulations. To address these limitations, we propose RGD-Blast, a robust and generalizable deep surrogate model for high-fidelity, long-term blast wave forecasting. RGD-Blast incorporates a multi-scale module to capture both global flow patterns and local boundary interactions, effectively mitigating error accumulation during autoregressive prediction. We introduce a dynamic-static feature coupling mechanism that fuses time-varying pressure fields with static source and layout features, thereby enhancing out-of-distribution generalization. Experiments demonstrate that RGD-Blast achieves a two-order-of-magnitude speedup over traditional numerical methods while maintaining comparable accuracy. In generalization tests on unseen building layouts, the model achieves an average RMSE below 0.01 and an R2 exceeding 0.89 over 280 consecutive time steps. Additional evaluations under varying blast source locations and explosive charge weights further validate its generalization, substantially advancing the state of the art in long-term blast wave modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

SeedFlood departs from these practices by exploiting the seed-reconstructible structure of zeroth-order updates and effectively making the messages near-zero in size, allowing them to be flooded to every client in the network. This mechanism makes communication overhead negligible and independent of model size, removing the primary scalability bottleneck in decentralized training. Consequently, SeedFlood enables training in regimes previously considered impractical, such as billion-parameter models distributed across hundreds of clients.

However, traditional architectures often rely on auxiliary networks such as encoders in Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) or discriminators in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which introduce training instability, computational overhead, and risks like mode collapse. We present NeuroSQL, a new generative paradigm that eliminates the need for auxiliary networks by learning low-dimensional latent representations implicitly. NeuroSQL leverages an asymptotic approximation that expresses the latent variables as the solution to an optimal transportation problem. Specifically, NeuroSQL learns the latent variables by solving a linear assignment problem and then passes the latent information to a standalone generator. We benchmark its performance against GANs, VAEs, and a budget-matched diffusion baseline on four datasets: handwritten digits (MNIST), faces (CelebA), animal faces (AFHQ), and brain images (OASIS). Compared to VAEs, GANs, and diffusion models: (1) in terms of image quality, NeuroSQL achieves overall lower mean pixel distance between synthetic and authentic images and stronger perceptual/structural fidelity; (2) computationally, NeuroSQL requires the least training time; and (3) practically, NeuroSQL provides an effective solution for generating synthetic data with limited training samples. By embracing quantile assignment rather than an encoder, NeuroSQL provides a fast, stable, and robust way to generate synthetic data with minimal information loss.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, despite the availability of high-performance computing infrastructure, many critical applications remain constrained by the substantial computational costs associated with generating large-scale, high-quality datasets and training models. In this work, inspired by studies on the structure of Green's functions for elliptic PDEs, we introduce Neural-HSS, a parameter-efficient architecture built upon the Hierarchical Semi-Separable (HSS) matrix structure that is provably data-efficient for a broad class of PDEs. We theoretically analyze the proposed architecture, proving that it satisfies exactness properties even in very low-data regimes. We also investigate its connections with other architectural primitives, such as the Fourier neural operator layer and convolutional layers. We experimentally validate the data efficiency of Neural-HSS on the three-dimensional Poisson equation over a grid of two million points, demonstrating its superior ability to learn from data generated by elliptic PDEs in the low-data regime while outperforming baseline methods. Finally, we demonstrate its capability to learn from data arising from a broad class of PDEs in diverse domains, including electromagnetism, fluid dynamics, and biology.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Code available at GitHub (link in paper)", "summary": "We propose a proof of concept for a variational distributional neuron: a compute unit formulated as a VAE brick, explicitly carrying a prior, an amortized posterior and a local ELBO. The unit is no longer a deterministic scalar but a distribution: computing is no longer about propagating values, but about contracting a continuous space of possibilities under constraints. Each neuron parameterizes a posterior, propagates a reparameterized sample and is regularized by the KL term of a local ELBO - hence, the activation is distributional. This \"contraction\" becomes testable through local constraints and can be monitored via internal measures. The amount of contextual information carried by the unit, as well as the temporal persistence of this information, are locally tuned by distinct constraints. This proposal addresses a structural tension: in sequential generation, causality is predominantly organized in the symbolic space and, even when latents exist, they often remain auxiliary, while the effective dynamics are carried by a largely deterministic decoder. In parallel, probabilistic latent models capture factors of variation and uncertainty, but that uncertainty typically remains borne by global or parametric mechanisms, while units continue to propagate scalars - hence the pivot question: if uncertainty is intrinsic to computation, why does the compute unit not carry it explicitly? We therefore draw two axes: (i) the composition of probabilistic constraints, which must be made stable, interpretable and controllable; and (ii) granularity: if inference is a negotiation of distributions under constraints, should the primitive unit remain deterministic or become distributional? We analyze \"collapse\" modes and the conditions for a \"living neuron\", then extend the contribution over time via autoregressive priors over the latent, per unit.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recent work, Exploring the Latent Capacity of LLMs for One-Step Text Reconstruction (Mezentsev and Oseledets), shows that frozen LLMs can reconstruct hundreds of tokens from only two learned proto-tokens in a single forward pass, suggesting a path beyond the autoregressive paradigm. In this paper, we study what information these proto-tokens encode and how they behave under reconstruction and controlled constraints. We perform a series of experiments aimed at disentangling semantic and syntactic content in the two proto-tokens, analyzing stability properties of the e-token, and visualizing attention patterns to the e-token during reconstruction. Finally, we test two regularization schemes for \"imposing\" semantic structure on the e-token using teacher embeddings, including an anchor-based loss and a relational distillation objective. Our results indicate that the m-token tends to capture semantic information more strongly than the e-token under standard optimization; anchor-based constraints trade off sharply with reconstruction accuracy; and relational distillation can transfer batch-level semantic relations into the proto-token space without sacrificing reconstruction quality, supporting the feasibility of future non-autoregressive seq2seq systems that predict proto-tokens as an intermediate representation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In particular, a growing body of literature has shown this limitation primarily through failures in out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, such as length extrapolation. In this work, we shift attention to the in-distribution implications of these limitations. We conduct a large-scale experimental study of the data efficiency of transformers and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) across multiple supervision regimes. We find that the amount of training data required by transformers grows much more rapidly with state-space size and sequence length than for RNNs. Furthermore, we analyze the extent to which learned state-tracking mechanisms are shared across different sequence lengths. We show that transformers exhibit negligible or even detrimental weight sharing across lengths, indicating that they learn length-specific solutions in isolation. In contrast, recurrent models exhibit effective amortized learning by sharing weights across lengths, allowing data from one sequence length to improve performance on others. Together, these results demonstrate that state tracking remains a fundamental challenge for transformers, even when training and evaluation distributions match.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While these systems often achieve strong performance, their recommendations are often difficult to justify: the influence of dataset meta-features on algorithm and hyperparameter choices is typically not exposed, limiting reliability, bias diagnostics, and efficient meta-feature engineering. This limits reliability and diagnostic insight for further improvements. In this work, we investigate the explainability of the meta-models in AutoClustering. We first review 22 existing methods and organize their meta-features into a structured taxonomy. We then apply a global explainability technique (i.e., Decision Predicate Graphs) to assess feature importance within meta-models from selected frameworks. Finally, we use local explainability tools such as SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to analyse specific clustering decisions. Our findings highlight consistent patterns in meta-feature relevance, identify structural weaknesses in current meta-learning strategies that can distort recommendations, and provide actionable guidance for more interpretable Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) design.

Conventional machine learning approaches, such as Support Vector Machines, variants of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), and tree-based methods like Random Forests, Extra Tree Regressors, and XGBoost, can capture nonlinearities but often struggle to respect the fundamental propeller law relationship between power and speed, resulting in poor extrapolation outside the training envelope. This study introduces a hybrid modeling framework that integrates physics-based knowledge from sea trials with data-driven residual learning. The baseline component, derived from calm-water power curves of the form $P = cV^n$, captures the dominant power-speed dependence, while another, nonlinear, regressor is then trained to predict the residual power, representing deviations caused by environmental and operational conditions. By constraining the machine learning task to residual corrections, the hybrid model simplifies learning, improves generalization, and ensures consistency with the underlying physics. In this study, an XGBoost, a simple Neural Network, and a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) coupled with the baseline component were compared to identical models without the baseline component. Validation on in-service data demonstrates that the hybrid model consistently outperformed a pure data-driven baseline in sparse data regions while maintaining similar performance in populated ones.

Ensemble approaches improve global consistency by aggregating multiple runs, but they typically lack tools for quantifying pointwise confidence in a way that combines cross-run agreement with geometric support from the learned cluster structure.

These are combined into a single, interpretable score in [0,1]. Our theoretical analysis shows that CAKE remains effective under noise and separates stable from unstable points.
