This study evaluates the technical potential of heavy-duty EV fleets to support the California power grid under three practical charging strategies: immediate charging, delayed charging, and constant-minimum-power charging. We develop a simulation framework that couples aggregated frequency dynamics with battery and charger constraints, state-of-charge management, and fleet-availability profiles. Performance is assessed using standard frequency security metrics, including nadir, rate-of-change-of-frequency, overshoot, and settling time, across credible contingency scenarios and renewable generation conditions. Results indicate that both non-V2G modes and V2G-enabled operation can contribute meaningful primary response, with V2G providing the strongest and fastest support while respecting mobility and network limits. Sensitivity analyses show that the relative benefits depend on charging strategy, control parameters, and renewable output, highlighting design trade-offs between response magnitude, duration, and battery usage. Overall, heavy-duty EV fleets-when coordinated by appropriate charging and V2G controls-offer a viable resource for strengthening primary frequency control on the California grid and mitigating stability challenges associated with increasing renewable penetration.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The investor trades a risk-free asset and several risky assets whose drifts and volatilities depend on an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck type LRR factor. Preferences are described by EZ utility with risk aversion $R$, elasticity of intertemporal substitution $\u03c8$, and discount rate $\u03b4$, so that the standard time-additive CRRA case appears as a limiting benchmark.\n  To handle the high-dimensional consumption--investment problem, I use a projected Pontryagin-guided deep policy optimization (P-PGDPO) scheme adapted to EZ preferences. The method starts from the continuous-time Hamiltonian implied by the Pontryagin maximum principle, represents the value and costate processes with neural networks, and updates the policy along the Hamiltonian gradient. Portfolio constraints and a lower bound on wealth are enforced by explicit projection operators rather than by adding ad hoc penalties.\n  Three main findings emerge from numerical experiments in a five-asset LRR economy: \\textbf{(1)} the P-PGDPO algorithm achieves stable convergence across multiple random seeds, validating its reliability for solving high-dimensional EZ problems; \\textbf{(2)} wealth floors materially reduce hedging demand by limiting the investor's ability to exploit intertemporal risk-return tradeoffs; and \\textbf{(3)} the learned hedging portfolios concentrate exposure in assets with high correlation to the LRR factor, confirming that EZ agents actively hedge long-run uncertainty rather than merely following myopic rules. Because EZ preferences nest time-additive CRRA in the limit $\u03c8\\to 1/R$, I use CRRA as an explicit diagnostic benchmark and, when needed, a warm start to stabilize training in high dimensions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This separation prevents models from learning representations that remain stable when resolution changes, a key requirement for practical neuropathology workflows. This study introduces Magnification-Aware Distillation (MAD), a self-supervised strategy that links low-magnification context with spatially aligned high-magnification detail, enabling the model to learn how coarse tissue structure relates to fine cellular patterns. The resulting foundation model, MAD-NP, is trained entirely through this cross-scale correspondence without annotations. A linear classifier trained only on 10x embeddings maintains 96.7% of its performance when applied to unseen 40x tiles, demonstrating strong resolution-invariant representation learning.

However, accurate channel estimation is critical and challenging to achieve the expected performance of the AFDM systems in doubly-dispersive channels. In this paper, we propose a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework for AFDM systems and develop a dynamic grid update strategy with two off-grid channel estimation methods, i.e., grid-refinement SBL (GR-SBL) and grid-evolution SBL (GE-SBL) estimators. Specifically, the GR-SBL employs a localized grid refinement method and dynamically updates grid for a high-precision estimation. The GE-SBL estimator approximates the off-grid components via first-order linear approximation and enables gradual grid evolution for estimation accuracy enhancement. Furthermore, we develop a distributed computing scheme to decompose the large-dimensional channel estimation model into multiple manageable small-dimensional sub-models for complexity reduction of GR-SBL and GE-SBL, denoted as distributed GR-SBL (D-GR-SBL) and distributed GE-SBL (D-GE-SBL) estimators, which also support parallel processing to reduce the computational latency. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed channel estimators outperform existing competitive schemes. The GR-SBL estimator achieves high-precision estimation with fine step sizes at the cost of high complexity, while the GE-SBL estimator provides a better trade-off between performance and complexity. The proposed D-GR-SBL and D-GE-SBL estimators effectively reduce complexity and maintain comparable performance to GR-SBL and GE-SBL estimators, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u4eff\u5c04\u9891\u5206\u590d\u7528\uff08AFDM\uff09\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u53cc\u8272\u6563\u4fe1\u9053\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5b66\u4e60\uff08SBL\uff09\u7684\u7f51\u683c\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7f51\u683c\u7ec6\u5316SBL\uff08GR-SBL\uff09\u548c\u7f51\u683c\u6f14\u5316SBL\uff08GE-SBL\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7248\u672c\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "AFDM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f66\u8054\u7f51\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u53ef\u9760\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u6ce2\u5f62\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u7136\u800c\u5728\u53cc\u8272\u6563\u4fe1\u9053\u4e2d\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u7a00\u758f\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5b66\u4e60\uff08SBL\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u4e8eAFDM\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\n2. \u5f00\u53d1GR-SBL\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff1a\u91c7\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u7f51\u683c\u7ec6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u7f51\u683c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\n3. \u5f00\u53d1GE-SBL\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u9636\u7ebf\u6027\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5904\u7406\u79bb\u7f51\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6e10\u8fdb\u5f0f\u7f51\u683c\u6f14\u5316\n4. \u5f00\u53d1\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6848\uff1a\u5c06\u5927\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u53ef\u7ba1\u7406\u7684\u5c0f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5b50\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u7684D-GR-SBL\u548cD-GE-SBL\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5e76\u884c\u5904\u7406\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5ef6\u8fdf", "result": "1. \u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u65b9\u6848\n2.

This paper develops a unified perspective on these phenomena by interpreting self-attention and residual streams as implementing an approximate Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA). In this view, queries and keys define role spaces, values encode fillers, attention weights perform soft unbinding, and residual connections realize superposition of many bound structures. We use this algebraic lens to relate transformer internals to chain-of-thought traces, program-based reasoning, and memory-augmented tool use, and to explain characteristic failure modes such as variable confusion and inconsistency across logically related prompts. Building on this perspective, we propose VSA-inspired architectural biases, including explicit binding/unbinding heads and hyperdimensional memory layers, and training objectives that promote role-filler separation and robust superposition. Finally, we outline metrics for measuring \"VSA-likeness\" and logical compositionality, and pose theoretical and architectural open problems.

Optical very-high-resolution (VHR) imagery is interpretable and straightforward to label, but clouds break this cadence. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables all-weather acquisitions, yet is difficult to annotate. We introduce SkyCap, a bitemporal VHR optical-SAR dataset constructed by archive matching and co-registration of (optical) SkySat and Capella Space (SAR) scenes. We utilize optical-to-SAR label transfer to obtain SAR amplitude change detection (ACD) labels without requiring SAR-expert annotations. We perform continued pretraining of SARATR-X on our SAR data and benchmark the resulting SAR-specific foundation models (FMs) together with SARATR-X against optical FMs on SkyCap under different preprocessing choices. Among evaluated models, MTP(ViT-B+RVSA), an optical FM, with dB+Z-score preprocessing attains the best result (F1$_c$ = 45.06), outperforming SAR-specific FMs further pretrained directly on Capella data. We observe strong sensitivity to preprocessing alignment with pretraining statistics, and the ranking of optical models on optical change detection does not transfer one-to-one to SAR ACD.

This reduces evaluation to shallow retrieval and overlooks the reality of incomplete KGs, where many facts are missing and answers must be inferred from existing facts. We bridge this gap by proposing a methodology for constructing benchmarks under KG incompleteness, which removes direct supporting triples while ensuring that alternative reasoning paths required to infer the answer remain. Experiments on benchmarks constructed using our methodology show that existing methods suffer consistent performance degradation under incompleteness, highlighting their limited reasoning ability. To overcome this limitation, we present the Adaptive Graph Reasoning Agent (GR-Agent). It first constructs an interactive environment from the KG, and then formalizes KGQA as agent environment interaction within this environment. GR-Agent operates over an action space comprising graph reasoning tools and maintains a memory of potential supporting reasoning evidence, including relevant relations and reasoning paths.

Socially compliant navigation that accounts for human comfort, social norms, and contextual appropriateness remains underexplored.

To address this issue, we investigate the effectiveness of small VLM and propose SocialNav-MoE, an efficient Mixture-of-Experts vision language model for socially compliant navigation with reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). We further introduce a semantic similarity reward (SSR) to effectively leverage RFT for enhancing the decision-making capabilities. Additionally, we study the effectiveness of different small language model types (Phi, Qwen, and StableLM), routing strategies, and vision encoders (CLIP vs. SigLIP, frozen vs. fine-tuned).

However, their performance is constrained by practical limitations. To address this, we propose a multi-functional antenna/surface system that leverages their complementary advantages. A rotatable IRS (R-IRS) is deployed to enhance downlink communications from a six-dimensional MA (6DMA)-equipped base station (BS) to multiple single-antenna users. To reduce the complexity of real-time channel estimation and beamforming, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the average sum-rate using a two-timescale (TTS) transmission protocol. Specifically, the BS antenna configuration (including position and rotation) and IRS rotation and reflection are optimized based on statistical channel state information (S-CSI), while BS transmit beamforming is designed using instantaneous CSI (I-CSI) in the short timescale. We first consider a single-user case and show that the 6DMA at the BS should form a sparse array for multi-beam transmission towards both the IRS and the user, allowing efficient coordination of direct and reflected channels, while the IRS rotation achieves effective multi-path alignment. For the general multi-user case, the optimization problem is non-convex and challenging to solve. To tackle this, we propose an efficient algorithm combining weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE) and stochastic successive convex approximation (SSCA) techniques. A low-complexity algorithm is also proposed to reduce computational complexity.

In this work, we present a rigorous architectural comparison between End-to-End Deep Fusion and Context-Aware Stacking for sepsis tasks. We initially hypothesized that a novel Quad-Modal Hierarchical Gated Attention Network -- termed SepsisFusionFormer -- would resolve complex cross-modal interactions between vitals, text, and imaging. However, experiments on MIMIC-IV revealed that SepsisFusionFormer suffered from \"attention starvation\" in the small antibiotic cohort ($N \\approx 2,100$), resulting in overfitting (AUC 0.66). This counterintuitive result informed the design of SepsisLateFusion, a \"leaner\" Context-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. By treating modalities as orthogonal experts -- the \"Historian\" (Static), the \"Monitor\" (Temporal), and the \"Reader\" (NLP) -- and dynamically gating them via a CatBoost meta-learner, we achieved State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance: 0.915 AUC for prediction 4 hours prior to clinical onset. By calibrating the decision threshold for clinical safety, we reduced missed cases by 48% relative to the default operating point, thus opening a true preventative window for timely intervention over reactive alerts. Furthermore, for the novel prescriptive task of multi-class antibiotic selection, we demonstrate that a Quad-Modal Ensemble achieved the highest performance (0.72 AUC). These models are integrated into SepsisSuite, a deployment-ready Python framework for clinical decision support.

A solution to address the need for more grid storage is to use the battery of electric vehicles as a back-up capacity. However, drivers tend to disconnect their electric vehicle when its battery is needed the most. We propose a charge scheduler that incentivizes drivers to delay their disconnection to improve vehicle-to-grid services. We also leverage drivers' temporal flexibility to alleviate congestion in oversubscribed charging stations.

Prior research calls for adaptive risk-management solutions and decision-making strategies. To this end, artificial intelligence (AI), particularly agentic AI, offers a promising path forward. Agentic AI systems consist of autonomous, specialized agents capable of solving complex, dynamic tasks. While past systems have relied on single-agent models or have used multi-agent frameworks only for static functions, there is a growing need for architectures that support dynamic collaborative reasoning and context-aware outputs. To bridge this gap, we present AgroAskAI, a multi-agent reasoning system for climate adaptation decision support in agriculture, with a focus on vulnerable rural communities. AgroAskAI features a modular, role-specialized architecture that uses a chain-of-responsibility approach to coordinate autonomous agents, integrating real-time tools and datasets. The system has built-in governance mechanisms that mitigate hallucination and enable internal feedback for coherent, locally relevant strategies. The system also supports multilingual interactions, making it accessible to non-English-speaking farmers. Experiments on common agricultural queries related to climate adaptation show that, with additional tools and prompt refinement, AgroAskAI delivers more actionable, grounded, and inclusive outputs.

Existing approaches often decouple these two states, lack stability guarantees, and exhibit limited generalization across operating conditions.

The architecture couples a Koopman-based latent dynamics model, which enables linear forecasting of nonlinear discharge-capacity evolution under varying operational conditions, with a neural operator that maps measurable intra-cycle signals to state of charge. The predicted discharge capacity is incorporated as a static correction within the neural operator pathway, yielding an age-aware state of charge estimate. Stability is ensured through spectral-radius clipping of the Koopman operator. The overall framework is trained end-to-end and evaluated on real-world lithium-ion battery datasets, demonstrating real-time capability while maintaining stable dynamics. To handle condition shifts and unseen regimes, the method integrates both zero-shot and few-shot out-of-distribution adaptation using only a limited number of cycles.

In the domain of chess, this standard manifests as accuracy benchmarks against strong engines like Stockfish. However, high scalar accuracy does not necessarily imply robust conceptual understanding. This paper argues that standard accuracy metrics fail to distinguish between genuine geometric reasoning and the superficial memorization of canonical board states. To address this gap, we propose a Geometric Stability Framework, a novel evaluation methodology that rigorously tests model consistency under invariant transformations-including board rotation, mirror symmetry, color inversion, and format conversion. We applied this framework to a comparative analysis of six state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Kimi K2 Turbo, utilizing a dataset of approximately 3,000 positions. Our results reveal a significant Accuracy-Stability Paradox. While models such as GPT-5.1 achieve near-optimal accuracy on standard positions, they exhibit catastrophic degradation under geometric perturbation, specifically in rotation tasks where error rates surge by over 600%. This disparity suggests a reliance on pattern matching over abstract spatial logic. Conversely, Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Kimi K2 Turbo demonstrate superior dual robustness, maintaining high consistency across all transformation axes. Furthermore, we analyze the trade-off between helpfulness and safety, identifying Gemini 2.5 Flash as the leader in illegal state rejection (96.0%). We conclude that geometric stability provides an orthogonal and essential metric for AI evaluation, offering a necessary proxy for disentangling reasoning capabilities from data contamination and overfitting in large-scale models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While recent advancements in machine learning have improved classification accuracy, issues such as limited dataset availability and a lack of standardised experimentation hinder generalisation and robustness. This paper introduces GSE ResNeXt, a deep learning architecture integrating learnable Gabor convolutional layers with a ResNeXt backbone enhanced by squeeze-and-excitation attention mechanisms. The Gabor filters serve as two-dimensional adaptive band-pass filters, extending the feature channel representation. Its combination with channel attention improves training stability and convergence while enhancing the model's ability to extract discriminative features. The model is evaluated on three classification tasks of increasing complexity. In particular, the impact of temporal differences between the training and testing data is explored, revealing that the distance between the vessel and sensor significantly affects performance. Results show that, GSE ResNeXt consistently outperforms baseline models like Xception, ResNet, and MobileNetV2, in terms of classification performance. Regarding stability and convergence, the addition of Gabor convolutions in the initial layers of the model represents a 28% reduction in training time.

Evaluated in the Reliable VQA Challenge at ICCV-CLVL 2025, DAVR achieves a leading $\u03a6_{100}$ score of 39.64 and a 100-AUC of 97.22, securing first place and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the trustworthiness of VLM responses.", "AI": {"tldr": "DAVR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30VLM\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5728ICCV-CLVL 2025\u53ef\u9760VQA\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u9886\u5148\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728VQA\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u4f46\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u635f\u5bb3\u7b54\u6848\u53ef\u9760\u6027", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDAVR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u4e00\u6761\u8def\u5f84\u5229\u7528\u53cc\u9009\u62e9\u5668\u6a21\u5757\u878d\u5408VLM\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u548cQA\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u54cd\u5e94\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff1b\u53e6\u4e00\u6761\u8def\u5f84\u90e8\u7f72\u5916\u90e8\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4ea4\u53c9\u68c0\u67e5\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u5e7b\u89c9", "result": "\u5728ICCV-CLVL 2025\u53ef\u9760VQA\u6311\u6218\u8d5b\u4e2d\uff0cDAVR\u53d6\u5f97\u9886\u5148\u7684\u03a6\u2081\u2080\u2080\u5206\u657039.64\u548c100-AUC 97.22\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u7b2c\u4e00\u540d", "conclusion": "DAVR\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3aVLM\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7efc\u5408\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u89e3\u51b3\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898"}}

This is particularly beneficial for video, which dominates network traffic and demands high bandwidth and power, making semantic approaches ideal for conserving resources while maintaining quality. In this paper, we propose a Predictability-aware and Entropy-adaptive Neural Motion Estimation (PENME) method to address challenges related to high latency, high bitrate, and power consumption in video transmission. PENME makes per-frame decisions to select a residual motion extraction model, convolutional neural network, vision transformer, or optical flow, using a five-step policy based on motion strength, global motion consistency, peak sharpness, heterogeneity, and residual error. The residual motions are then transmitted to the receiver, where the frames are reconstructed via motion-compensated updates. Next, a selective diffusion-based refinement, the Latent Consistency Model (LCM-4), is applied on frames that trigger refinement due to low predictability or large residuals, while predictable frames skip refinement. PENME also allocates radio resource blocks with awareness of residual motion and channel state, reducing power consumption and bandwidth usage while maintaining high semantic similarity. Our simulation results on the Vimeo90K dataset demonstrate that the proposed PENME method handles various types of video, outperforming traditional communication, hybrid, and adaptive bitrate semantic communication techniques, achieving 40% lower latency, 90% less transmitted data, and 35% higher throughput. For semantic communication metrics, PENME improves PSNR by about 40%, increases MS-SSIM by roughly 19%, and reduces LPIPS by nearly 35%, compared with the baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this, we propose an Audio-Visual Cross-Modal Compression (AVCC) framework that jointly compresses audio and video streams. Our framework extracts motion information from video and tokenizes audio features, then aligns them through a unified audio-video diffusion process. This allows synchronized reconstruction of both modalities from a shared representation. In extremely low-rate scenarios, AVCC can even reconstruct one modality from the other.

The acquisition of channel state information (CSI) is critical, as it determines the placement of ports/antennas, which directly impacts FAS-based optimization. Although various channel estimation methods have been developed, significant flaws persist. For instance, the performance of greedy-based algorithms is heavily influenced by signal assumptions, and current model-free methods are infeasible due to prohibitively high computational complexity issue. Consequently, there is a pressing need for a well-balanced solution that exhibits flexibility, feasibility, and low complexity to support massive connectivity in FAS. In this work, we propose methods based on approximate message passing (AMP) integrated with adaptive expectation maximization (EM). The EM-AMP framework uniquely enables efficient large matrix computations with adaptive learning capabilities, independent of prior knowledge of the model or parameters within potential distributions, making it a robust candidate for FAS networks. We introduce two variants of the EM-AMP framework that leverage geographical and angular features in a FAS network. These proposed algorithms demonstrate improved estimation precision, fast convergence, and low computational complexity in large activity regions.

Additionally, most existing methods are built upon Transformer architectures. However, transformers incur a quadratic attention cost, limiting their ability to model long spatial and temporal sequences-particularly on resource-constrained edge platforms. As autonomous driving inherently demands efficient temporal modeling, this challenge severely limits their deployment and real-time performance. Recently, linear attention mechanisms have gained increasing attention due to their superior spatiotemporal complexity. However, existing linear attention architectures are limited to self-attention, lacking support for cross-modal and cross-temporal interactions-both crucial for autonomous driving. In this work, we propose LADY, the first fully linear attention-based generative model for end-to-end autonomous driving. LADY enables fusion of long-range temporal context at inference with constant computational and memory costs, regardless of the history length of camera and LiDAR features. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight linear cross-attention mechanism that enables effective cross-modal information exchange.

This work, for the first time, investigates how low-level, bitwise perturbations (fault injection) to the weights of a large language model (LLM) used for image captioning can influence the semantic meaning of its generated descriptions while preserving grammatical structure. While prior fault analysis methods have shown that flipping a few bits can crash classifiers or degrade accuracy, these approaches overlook the semantic and linguistic dimensions of generative systems. In image captioning models, a single flipped bit might subtly alter how visual features map to words, shifting the entire narrative an AI tells about the world. We hypothesize that such semantic drifts are not random but differentiably estimable. That is, the model's own gradients can predict which bits, if perturbed, will most strongly influence meaning while leaving syntax and fluency intact. We design a differentiable fault analysis framework, BLADE (Bit-level Fault Analysis via Differentiable Estimation), that uses gradient-based sensitivity estimation to locate semantically critical bits and then refines their selection through a caption-level semantic-fluency objective. Our goal is not merely to corrupt captions, but to understand how meaning itself is encoded, distributed, and alterable at the bit level, revealing that even imperceptible low-level changes can steer the high-level semantics of generative vision-language models. It also opens pathways for robustness testing, adversarial defense, and explainable AI, by exposing how structured bit-level faults can reshape a model's semantic output.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We present HERBench, a VideoQA benchmark purpose-built to assess multi-evidence integration across time. Each question requires aggregating at least three non-overlapping evidential cues across distinct video segments, so neither language priors nor a single snapshot can suffice. HERBench comprises 26K five-way multiple-choice questions organized into twelve compositional tasks that probe identity binding, cross-entity relations, temporal ordering, co-occurrence verification, and counting. To make evidential demand measurable, we introduce the Minimum Required Frame-Set (MRFS), the smallest number of frames a model must fuse to answer correctly, and show that HERBench imposes substantially higher demand than prior datasets (mean MRFS 5.5 vs. 2.6-4.2). Evaluating 13 state-of-the-art Video-LLMs on HERBench reveals pervasive failures: accuracies of 31-42% are only slightly above the 20% random-guess baseline. We disentangle this failure into two critical bottlenecks: (1) a retrieval deficit, where frame selectors overlook key evidence, and (2) a fusion deficit, where models fail to integrate information even when all necessary evidence is provided. By making cross-time evidence both unavoidable and quantifiable, HERBench establishes a principled target for advancing robust, compositional video understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "HERBench\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6574\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u81f3\u5c11\u878d\u5408\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u878d\u5408\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u8bc1\u636e\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7f3a\u9677\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u9891\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u901a\u5e38\u5141\u8bb8\u95ee\u9898\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u4e00\u663e\u8457\u7ebf\u7d22\u56de\u7b54\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9700\u8981\u6574\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u79bb\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b26K\u4e2a\u4e94\u9009\u4e00\u591a\u9009\u9898\u7684HERBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5206\u4e3a12\u4e2a\u7ec4\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6700\u5c0f\u5fc5\u9700\u5e27\u96c6(MRFS)\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u8bc1\u636e\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f3013\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff08\u51c6\u786e\u738731-42%\uff0c\u4ec5\u7565\u9ad8\u4e8e20%\u968f\u673a\u731c\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\uff09\uff0c\u5931\u8d25\u539f\u56e0\u5305\u62ec\u68c0\u7d22\u7f3a\u9677\uff08\u5ffd\u7565\u5173\u952e\u8bc1\u636e\uff09\u548c\u878d\u5408\u7f3a\u9677\uff08\u5373\u4f7f\u63d0\u4f9b\u6240\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u8bc1\u636e\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u6574\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "HERBench\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u8de8\u65f6\u95f4\u8bc1\u636e\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u4e14\u53ef\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a8\u8fdb\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u7ec4\u5408\u5f0f\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u9891\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u8bc1\u636e\u6574\u5408\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

However, as wireless environments become increasingly dynamic and complex, ISAC systems require more intelligent processing and more autonomous operation to maintain efficiency and adaptability. Meanwhile, agentic artificial intelligence (AI) offers a feasible solution to address these challenges by enabling continuous perception-reasoning-action loops in dynamic environments to support intelligent, autonomous, and efficient operation for ISAC systems. As such, we delve into the application value and prospects of agentic AI in ISAC systems in this work. Firstly, we provide a comprehensive review of agentic AI and ISAC systems to demonstrate their key characteristics. Secondly, we show several common optimization approaches for ISAC systems and highlight the significant advantages of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)-based agentic AI. Thirdly, we propose a novel agentic ISAC framework and prensent a case study to verify its superiority in optimizing ISAC performance. Finally, we clarify future research directions for agentic AI-based ISAC systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While a wide range of flexible resources-including electric vehicles (EVs), data centers, and battery energy storage systems (BESS)-have demonstrated the physical capability to provide fast frequency response (FFR), existing studies primarily focus on individual resource performance or controller-level designs. A systematic framework that translates heterogeneous FFR capabilities into deployable, system-level frequency services remains largely unexplored. This paper proposes a service-oriented coordination framework for fast frequency response from flexible loads and energy storage, bridging the gap between physical capability assessment and grid-operational utilization. The framework decomposes frequency support into multiple time-critical service layers based on response speed, power capacity, and energy sustainability, and dynamically allocates FFR responsibilities among heterogeneous resources accordingly. By explicitly accounting for response latency, saturation limits, and energy constraints, the proposed approach enables coordinated dispatch that prioritizes ultra-fast resources for initial frequency arrest while leveraging slower but energy-rich resources to sustain recovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u9ad8\u6bd4\u4f8b\u9006\u53d8\u7535\u6e90\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7535\u7f51\u60ef\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u9891\u7387\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9762\u5411\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u67d4\u6027\u8d1f\u8377\u4e0e\u50a8\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u9891\u7387\u54cd\u5e94\u534f\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u7535\u7f51\u8c03\u5ea6\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u6e17\u900f\u7387\u7684\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u60ef\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u7535\u7f51\u5bf9\u6270\u52a8\u540e\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u9891\u7387\u53d8\u5316\u66f4\u4e3a\u654f\u611f\u3002\u867d\u7136\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u3001\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u3001\u7535\u6c60\u50a8\u80fd\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u8d44\u6e90\u5177\u5907\u5feb\u901f\u9891\u7387\u54cd\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u4e00\u8d44\u6e90\u6027\u80fd\u6216\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5c06\u5f02\u6784\u8d44\u6e90\u80fd\u529b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u670d\u52a1\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u670d\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u54cd\u5e94\u901f\u5ea6\u3001\u529f\u7387\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u5c06\u9891\u7387\u652f\u6491\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u65f6\u95f4\u5173\u952e\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u5c42\uff0c\u5e76\u636e\u6b64\u52a8\u6001\u5206\u914d\u5f02\u6784\u8d44\u6e90\u7684FFR\u8d23\u4efb\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u8003\u8651\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u9971\u548c\u9650\u5236\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u534f\u8c03\u8c03\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u8d85\u5feb\u8d44\u6e90\u8fdb\u884c\u521d\u59cb\u9891\u7387\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u8f83\u6162\u4f46\u80fd\u91cf\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u7ef4\u6301\u6062\u590d\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u5f02\u6784FFR\u80fd\u529b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u9891\u7387\u670d\u52a1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u54cd\u5e94\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0e\u9ad8\u80fd\u91cf\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u914d\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9891\u7387\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6062\u590d\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u670d\u52a1\u5bfc\u5411\u534f\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7075\u6d3b\u8d1f\u8377\u548c\u50a8\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5feb\u901f\u9891\u7387\u54cd\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0e\u7535\u7f51\u8fd0\u884c\u5e94\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u8d44\u6e90\u5728\u9891\u7387\u7a33\u5b9a\u670d\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u534f\u540c\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Preserving relative spatial distances in the latent space, channel charting is well suited to support user localization. While prior work on channel charting has mainly focused on two-dimensional scenarios, real-world environments are inherently three-dimensional. In this work, we investigate two distinct three-dimensional indoor localization scenarios using simulated, but realistic ray tracing-based datasets: a factory hall with a three-dimensional spatial distribution of datapoints, and a multistory building where each floor exhibits a two-dimensional datapoint distribution. For the first scenario, we apply the concept of augmented channel charting, which combines classical localization and channel charting, to a three-dimensional setting. For the second scenario, we introduce multistory channel charting, a two-stage approach consisting of floor classification via clustering followed by the training of a dedicated expert neural network for channel charting on each individual floor, thereby enhancing the channel charting performance. In addition, we propose a novel feature engineering method designed to extract sparse features from the beamspace channel state information that are suitable for localization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Benchmarking Large Language Models for Financial Intelligence and the Surprising Efficiency Paradox", "comment": null, "summary": "The rapid adoption of large language models in financial services necessitates rigorous evaluation frameworks to assess their performance, efficiency, and practical applicability. This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the GPT-OSS model family alongside contemporary LLMs across ten diverse financial NLP tasks. Through extensive experimentation on 120B and 20B parameter variants of GPT-OSS, we reveal a counterintuitive finding: the smaller GPT-OSS-20B model achieves comparable accuracy (65.1% vs 66.5%) while demonstrating superior computational efficiency with 198.4 Token Efficiency Score and 159.80 tokens per second processing speed [1]. Our evaluation encompasses sentiment analysis, question answering, and entity recognition tasks using real-world financial datasets including Financial PhraseBank, FiQA-SA, and FLARE FINERORD. We introduce novel efficiency metrics that capture the trade-off between model performance and resource utilization, providing critical insights for deployment decisions in production environments. The benchmark reveals that GPT-OSS models consistently outperform larger competitors including Qwen3-235B, challenging the prevailing assumption that model scale directly correlates with task performance [2].

However, quantitatively accurate results require accurate optical fluence estimates. Robust modeling in heterogeneous tissue, where light with different wavelengths can experience significantly different absorption and scattering, is difficult. In this work, we developed a deep neural network (Hybrid-Net) for sPA imaging to simultaneously estimate sO2 in blood vessels and segment those vessels from surrounding background tissue. sO2 error was minimized only in blood vessels segmented in Hybrid-Net, resulting in more accurate predictions. Hybrid-Net was first trained on simulated sPA data (at 700 nm and 850 nm) representing initial pressure distributions from three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations of light transport in breast tissue. Then, for experimental verification, the network was retrained on experimental sPA data (at 700 nm and 850 nm) acquired from simple tissue mimicking phantoms with an embedded blood pool. Quantitative measures were used to evaluate Hybrid-Net performance with an averaged segmentation accuracy of >= 0.978 in simulations with varying noise levels (0dB-35dB) and 0.998 in the experiment, and an averaged sO2 mean squared error of <= 0.048 in simulations with varying noise levels (0dB-35dB) and 0.003 in the experiment. Overall, these results show that Hybrid-Net can provide accurate blood oxygenation without estimating the optical fluence, and this study could lead to improvements in in-vivo sO2 estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Robustness involves temporarily inflating prior estimates of noise covariances, while adaptivity updates prior beliefs using real-time information. In practical applications, both process and measurement noise can be influenced by outliers, be time-varying, or both. Existing works may not effectively address the above complex noise scenarios, as there is an intrinsic incompatibility between robust filters and adaptive filters. In this work, we propose a unified variational robust Kalman filter, built on a Student's t-distribution induced loss function and variational inference, and solved through fixed-point iteration in a computationally efficient manner. We demonstrate that robustness can be understood as a prerequisite for adaptivity, making it possible to merge the above two competing goals into a single framework through switching rules. Additionally, our proposed filter can recover conventional KF, robust KF, and adaptive KF by adjusting parameters, and can suppress both the imperfect process and measurement noise, enabling it to perform superiorly in complex noise environments.

However, existing LLM reasoning strategies mainly rely on the LLM itself with fast or slow mode (like o1 thinking) and thus struggle to balance reasoning efficiency and accuracy across queries of varying difficulties. In this paper, we propose Cognitive-Inspired Elastic Reasoning (CogER), a framework inspired by human hierarchical reasoning that dynamically selects the most suitable reasoning strategy for each query. Specifically, CogER first assesses the complexity of incoming queries and assigns them to one of several predefined levels, each corresponding to a tailored processing strategy, thereby addressing the challenge of unobservable query difficulty. To achieve automatic strategy selection, we model the process as a Markov Decision Process and train a CogER-Agent using reinforcement learning. The agent is guided by a reward function that balances solution quality and computational cost, ensuring resource-efficient reasoning. Moreover, for queries requiring external tools, we introduce Cognitive Tool-Assisted Reasoning, which enables the LLM to autonomously invoke external tools within its chain-of-thought. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CogER outperforms state-of-the-art Test-Time scaling methods, achieving at least a 13% relative improvement in average exact match on In-Domain tasks and an 8% relative gain on Out-of-Domain tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing attention- or graph-based methods face three key issues: (a) strong temporal self-dependencies are often disrupted by irrelevant variables; (b) softmax normalization ignores and reverses negative correlations; (c) variables struggle to perceive their temporal positions. To address these, we propose \\textbf{SEED}, a Spectral Entropy-guided Evaluation framework for spatial-temporal Dependency modeling. SEED introduces a Dependency Evaluator, a key innovation that leverages spectral entropy to dynamically provide a preliminary evaluation of the spatial and temporal dependencies of each variable, enabling the model to adaptively balance Channel Independence (CI) and Channel Dependence (CD) strategies. To account for temporal regularities originating from the influence of other variables rather than intrinsic dynamics, we propose Spectral Entropy-based Fuser to further refine the evaluated dependency weights, effectively separating this part. Moreover, to preserve negative correlations, we introduce a Signed Graph Constructor that enables signed edge weights, overcoming the limitations of softmax. Finally, to help variables perceive their temporal positions and thereby construct more comprehensive spatial features, we introduce the Context Spatial Extractor, which leverages local contextual windows to extract spatial features. Extensive experiments on 12 real-world datasets from various application domains demonstrate that SEED achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness and generality.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Contemporary AI tools automate this for species with distinctive morphological features but remain largely image-based. Here, we extend Re-ID methodologies by incorporating precise dermatoglyphic textual descriptors-an approach used in forensics but new to ecology. We demonstrate that these specialist semantics abstract and encode animal coat topology using human-interpretable language tags. Drawing on 84,264 manually labelled minutiae across 3,355 images of 185 tigers (Panthera tigris), we evaluate this visual-textual methodology, revealing novel capabilities for cross-modal identity retrieval. To optimise performance, we developed a text-image co-synthesis pipeline to generate 'virtual individuals', each comprising dozens of life-like visuals paired with dermatoglyphic text. Benchmarking against real-world scenarios shows this augmentation significantly boosts AI accuracy in cross-modal retrieval while alleviating data scarcity. We conclude that dermatoglyphic language-guided biometrics can overcome vision-only limitations, enabling textual-to-visual identity recovery underpinned by human-verifiable matchings.

Recent transformer-based approaches have used self-attention maps to identify informative regions within images, but they often struggle in complex scenes with multiple objects, where self-attention lacks explicit task guidance. To address this, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Semantic Communication framework that integrates text-based user queries to guide the information extraction process. Our proposed system employs a cross-modal attention mechanism that fuses visual features with language embeddings to produce soft relevance scores over the visual data. Based on these scores and the instantaneous channel bandwidth, we use an algorithm to transmit image patches at adaptive resolutions using independently trained encoder-decoder pairs, with total bitrate matching the channel capacity. At the receiver, the patches are reconstructed and combined to preserve task-critical information. This flexible and goal-driven design enables efficient semantic communication in complex and bandwidth-constrained environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u67e5\u8be2\u5f15\u5bfc\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f20\u8f93\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u5e26\u5bbd\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u63d0\u5347\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u96be\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "1. \u96c6\u6210\u6587\u672c\u67e5\u8be2\u5f15\u5bfc\u4fe1\u606f\u63d0\u53d6\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1b2. \u91c7\u7528\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8f6f\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\uff1b3. \u57fa\u4e8e\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u77ac\u65f6\u5e26\u5bbd\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f20\u8f93\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\uff1b4. \u72ec\u7acb\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5bf9\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u5339\u914d\u4fe1\u9053\u5bb9\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u548c\u5e26\u5bbd\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u4f18\u5148\u4f20\u8f93\u4efb\u52a1\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u4e0e\u4fe1\u9053\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u5339\u914d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This study presents a comprehensive longitudinal evaluation of pediatric iris recognition, analyzing 276 subjects enrolled between ages 4-12 and followed up to nine years through adolescence. Using 18,318 near-infrared iris images acquired semi-annually, we evaluated commercial (VeriEye) and open-source (OpenIris) systems through linear mixed-effects models that disentangle enrollment age, developmental maturation, and elapsed time while controlling for image quality and physiological factors. False non-match rates remained below 0.5% across the nine-year period for both matchers using pediatric-calibrated thresholds, approaching adult-level performance. However, we reveal significant algorithm-dependent temporal behaviors: VeriEye's apparent decline reflects developmental confounding across enrollment cohorts rather than genuine template aging, while OpenIris exhibits modest but genuine temporal aging (0.5 standard deviations over eight years). Image quality and pupil dilation constancy dominated longitudinal performance, with dilation effects reaching 3.0-3.5 standard deviations, substantially exceeding temporal factors. Failures concentrated in 9.4% of subjects with persistent acquisition challenges rather than accumulating with elapsed time, confirming acquisition conditions as the primary limitation. These findings justify extending conservative re-enrollment policies, potentially to 10-12 year validity periods for high-quality enrollments at ages 7+, and demonstrate iris recognition remains viable throughout childhood and adolescence with proper imaging control.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Closed-form expressions of interferences in the discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT) domain are derived by utilizing the stationary phase principle and the Affine Fourier transform convolution theorem, which indicates that interference impacts can be classified into stationary and non-stationary categories. On this basis, we reveal the analytical relationship between packet throughput and the paramerters of spread spectrum and error correction coding in our proposed anti-interference system, which enables the design of a parameter optimization algorithm that maximizes packet throughput. For reception, by jointly utilizing the autocorrelation function of spreading sequence and the cyclic-shift property of AFDM input-output relation, we design a linear-complexity correlation-based DAFT domain detector (CDD) capable of achieving full diversity gain, which performs correlation-based equalization to avoid matrix inversion.

Relaxed Decision Diagrams (DDs) provide a versatile mechanism for deriving such dual bounds by compactly over-approximating the solution space through node merging. However, the quality of these relaxed diagrams, i.e. the tightness of the resulting dual bounds, depends critically on the variable ordering and the merging decisions executed during compilation. While dynamic variable ordering heuristics effectively tighten bounds, they often incur computational overhead when evaluated globally across the entire variable set. To mitigate this trade-off, this work introduces a novel clustering-based framework for variable ordering. Instead of applying dynamic ordering heuristics to the full set of unfixed variables, we first partition variables into clusters. We then leverage this structural decomposition to guide the ordering process, significantly reducing the heuristic's search space. Within this framework, we investigate two distinct strategies: Cluster-to-Cluster, which processes clusters sequentially using problem-specific aggregate criteria (such as cumulative vertex weights in the Maximum Weighted Independent Set Problem (MWISP)), and Pick-and-Sort, which iteratively selects and sorts representative variables from each cluster to balance local diversity with heuristic guidance. Later on, developing some theoretical results on the growth of the size of DDs for MWISP we propose two different policies for setting the number of clusters within the proposed framework. We embed these strategies into a DD-based branch-and-bound algorithm and evaluate them on the MWISP. Across benchmark instances, the proposed methodology consistently reduces computational costs compared to standard dynamic variable ordering baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

As interpretability and robustness gain increasing importance, explanation-guided learning has emerged as an effective framework by introducing attribution-based supervision during training; however, deriving general and reliable attribution priors remains a significant challenge. Through an analysis of representative attribution methods in classification settings, we find that although these methods can reliably highlight class-relevant tokens, they often focus on common keywords shared by semantically similar classes. Because such classes are already difficult to distinguish under standard training, these attributions provide insufficient discriminative cues, limiting their ability to improve model differentiation. To overcome this limitation, we propose Class-Aware Attribution Prior (CAP), a novel attribution prior extraction framework that guides language models toward capturing fine-grained class distinctions and producing more salient, discriminative attribution priors. Building on this idea, we further introduce CAP Hybrid, which combines priors from CAP with those from existing attribution techniques to form a more comprehensive and balanced supervisory signal. By aligning a model's self-attribution with these enriched priors, our approach encourages the learning of diverse, decision-relevant features. Extensive experiments in full-data, few-shot, and adversarial scenarios demonstrate that our method consistently enhances both interpretability and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We propose Vibe Space, a hierarchical graph manifold that learns low-dimensional geodesics in feature spaces like CLIP, enabling smooth and semantically consistent transitions between concepts. To evaluate creative quality, we design a cognitively inspired framework combining human judgments, LLM reasoning, and a geometric path-based difficulty score.

Existing automated systems are normally task-specific, lacking a unified framework to manage diverse, end-to-end workflows--from data preprocessing to advanced interpretation--across diverse RS applications. To address this gap, this paper introduces CangLing-KnowFlow, a unified intelligent agent framework that integrates a Procedural Knowledge Base (PKB), Dynamic Workflow Adjustment, and an Evolutionary Memory Module. The PKB, comprising 1,008 expert-validated workflow cases across 162 practical RS tasks, guides planning and substantially reduces hallucinations common in general-purpose agents. During runtime failures, the Dynamic Workflow Adjustment autonomously diagnoses and replans recovery strategies, while the Evolutionary Memory Module continuously learns from these events, iteratively enhancing the agent's knowledge and performance. This synergy enables CangLing-KnowFlow to adapt, learn, and operate reliably across diverse, complex tasks. We evaluated CangLing-KnowFlow on the KnowFlow-Bench, a novel benchmark of 324 workflows inspired by real-world applications, testing its performance across 13 top Large Language Model (LLM) backbones, from open-source to commercial. Across all complex tasks, CangLing-KnowFlow surpassed the Reflexion baseline by at least 4% in Task Success Rate. As the first most comprehensive validation along this emerging field, this research demonstrates the great potential of CangLing-KnowFlow as a robust, efficient, and scalable automated solution for complex EO challenges by leveraging expert knowledge (Knowledge) into adaptive and verifiable procedures (Flow).", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A popular method for creating realistic patient data is the rule-based Synthea data generator. Synthea generates data based on rules describing the lifetime of a synthetic patient. These rules typically express the probability of a condition occurring, such as a disease, depending on factors like age. Since they only contain statistical information, rules usually have no specific data protection requirements. However, creating meaningful rules can be a very complex process that requires expert knowledge and realistic sample data. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate an approach to automatically generate Synthea rules based on statistics from tabular data, which we extracted from cancer reports. As an example use case, we created a Synthea module for glioblastoma from a real-world dataset and used it to generate a synthetic dataset. Compared to the original dataset, the synthetic data reproduced known disease courses and mostly retained the statistical properties.

However, these models may achieve high validation accuracy by learning specimen-specific artifacts rather than generalizable biological features, limiting real-world clinical utility. We introduce PANDA-PLUS-Bench, a curated benchmark dataset derived from expert-annotated prostate biopsies designed specifically to quantify this failure mode. The benchmark comprises nine carefully selected whole slide images from nine unique patients containing diverse Gleason patterns, with non-overlapping tissue patches extracted at both 512x512 and 224x224 pixel resolutions across eight augmentation conditions. Using this benchmark, we evaluate seven foundation models on their ability to separate biological signal from slide-level confounders. Our results reveal substantial variation in robustness across models: Virchow2 achieved the lowest slide-level encoding among large-scale models (81.0%) yet exhibited the second-lowest cross-slide accuracy (47.2%). HistoEncoder, trained specifically on prostate tissue, demonstrated the highest cross-slide accuracy (59.7%) and the strongest slide-level encoding (90.3%), suggesting tissue-specific training may enhance both biological feature capture and slide-specific signatures.

Early prediction of recurrence following treatment could enable timely clinical intervention and improve patient outcomes. This study proposes an artificial intelligence based approach for predicting brain metastasis recurrence using multimodal imaging and clinical data. A retrospective cohort of 97 patients was collected, including Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) acquired before treatment and at first follow-up, together with relevant clinical variables. Image preprocessing included CT windowing and artifact reduction, MRI enhancement, and multimodal CT MRI registration. After applying inclusion criteria, 53 patients were retained for analysis. Radiomics features were extracted from the imaging data, and delta radiomics was employed to characterize temporal changes between pre-treatment and follow-up scans. Multiple machine learning classifiers were trained and evaluated, including an analysis of discrepancies between treatment planning target volumes and delivered isodose volumes. Despite limitations related to sample size and class imbalance, the results demonstrate the feasibility of radiomics based models, namely ensemble models, for recurrence prediction and suggest a potential association between radiation dose discrepancies and recurrence risk.

The efficiency of the synthesis process, however, is critically dependent on exploration policies. These policies often rely on fixed rules or strategies learned through reinforcement learning (RL) that consider only a limited set of current features. To address this limitation, this paper introduces GCRL, an approach that enhances RL-based methods by integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GCRL encodes the history of LTS exploration into a graph structure, allowing it to capture a broader, non-current-based context. In a comparative experiment against state-of-the-art methods, GCRL exhibited superior learning efficiency and generalization across four out of five benchmark domains, except one particular domain characterized by high symmetry and strictly local interactions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The HAT architecture incorporates a tree-structured inductive bias that enables the modeling of hierarchical relationships present in the data and thus achieves significant computational savings compared to conventional flat attention models.

Despite aggressive treatment, the median survival rate is less than 15 months. Accurate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) tumor segmentation is critical for surgical planning, radiotherapy, and disease monitoring. While deep learning models have improved the accuracy of automated segmentation, large-scale pre-trained models generalize poorly and often underperform, producing systematic errors such as false positives, label swaps, and slice discontinuities in slices. These limitations are further compounded by unequal access to GPU resources and the growing environmental cost of large-scale model training. In this work, we propose adaptive post-processing techniques to refine the quality of glioma segmentations produced by large-scale pretrained models developed for various types of tumors. We demonstrated the techniques in multiple BraTS 2025 segmentation challenge tasks, with the ranking metric improving by 14.9 % for the sub-Saharan Africa challenge and 0.9% for the adult glioma challenge. This approach promotes a shift in brain tumor segmentation research from increasingly complex model architectures to efficient, clinically aligned post-processing strategies that are precise, computationally fair, and sustainable.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Given medical guidelines for abdominal organs, the process of managing incidental findings is automated through a planner-executor framework. The planner, based on LLM, generates Python scripts using predefined base functions, while the executor runs these scripts to perform the necessary checks and detections, via VLMs, segmentation models, and image processing subroutines.\n  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on a CT abdominal benchmark for three organs, in a fully automatic end-to-end manner.

As the prevalence of students utilizing AI for assignments increases, concerns regarding academic integrity and the validity of assessments are growing. This study utilizes the Earth Science I section of the 2025 Korean College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) to deeply analyze the multimodal scientific reasoning capabilities and cognitive limitations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. Three experimental conditions (full-page input, individual item input, and optimized multimodal input) were designed to evaluate model performance across different data structures. Quantitative results indicated that unstructured inputs led to significant performance degradation due to segmentation and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) failures. Even under optimized conditions, models exhibited fundamental reasoning flaws. Qualitative analysis revealed that \"Perception Errors\" were dominant, highlighting a \"Perception-Cognition Gap\" where models failed to interpret symbolic meanings in schematic diagrams despite recognizing visual data. Furthermore, models demonstrated a \"Calculation-Conceptualization Discrepancy,\" successfully performing calculations while failing to apply the underlying scientific concepts, and \"Process Hallucination,\" where models skipped visual verification in favor of plausible but unfounded background knowledge. Addressing the challenge of unauthorized AI use in coursework, this study provides actionable cues for designing \"AI-resistant questions\" that target these specific cognitive vulnerabilities.

While current state-of-the-art systems rely on closed data or compute-heavy models, TalkVerse offers 2.3 million high-resolution (720p/1080p) audio-video synchronized clips totaling 6.3k hours. These are curated from over 60k hours of video via a transparent pipeline that includes scene-cut detection, aesthetic assessment, strict audio-visual synchronization checks, and comprehensive annotations including 2D skeletons and structured visual/audio-style captions. Leveraging TalkVerse, we present a reproducible 5B DiT baseline built on Wan2.2-5B. By utilizing a video VAE with a high downsampling ratio and a sliding window mechanism with motion-frame context, our model achieves minute-long generation with low drift. It delivers comparable lip-sync and visual quality to the 14B Wan-S2V model but with 10$\\times$ lower inference cost. To enhance storytelling in long videos, we integrate an MLLM director to rewrite prompts based on audio and visual cues. Furthermore, our model supports zero-shot video dubbing via controlled latent noise injection. We open-source the dataset, training recipes, and 5B checkpoints to lower barriers for research in audio-driven human video generation.

We introduce the Quantum Decision Transformer (QDT), a novel architecture incorporating quantum-inspired computational mechanisms to address these challenges. Our approach integrates two core components: Quantum-Inspired Attention with entanglement operations that capture non-local feature correlations, and Quantum Feedforward Networks with multi-path processing and learnable interference for adaptive computation. Through comprehensive experiments on continuous control tasks, we demonstrate over 2,000\\% performance improvement compared to standard DTs, with superior generalization across varying data qualities. Critically, our ablation studies reveal strong synergistic effects between quantum-inspired components: neither alone achieves competitive performance, yet their combination produces dramatic improvements far exceeding individual contributions. This synergy demonstrates that effective quantum-inspired architecture design requires holistic co-design of interdependent mechanisms rather than modular component adoption. Our analysis identifies three key computational advantages: enhanced credit assignment through non-local correlations, implicit ensemble behavior via parallel processing, and adaptive resource allocation through learnable interference. These findings establish quantum-inspired design principles as a promising direction for advancing transformer architectures in sequential decision-making, with implications extending beyond reinforcement learning to neural architecture design more broadly.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We present Puzzle Curriculum GRPO (PC-GRPO), a supervision-free recipe for RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) that strengthens visual reasoning in VLMs without annotations or external verifiers. PC-GRPO replaces labels with three self-supervised puzzle environments: PatchFit, Rotation (with binary rewards) and Jigsaw (with graded partial credit mitigating reward sparsity). To counter flat rewards and vanishing group-relative advantages, we introduce a difficulty-aware curriculum that dynamically weights samples and peaks at medium difficulty.

Conformal prediction (CP) is a popular tool that allows users to turn heuristic uncertainty estimates into uncertainty estimates with statistical guarantees. CP works by converting predictions of a ML model, together with a calibration sample, into prediction sets that are guaranteed to contain the true label with any desired probability. An often cited advantage is that CP theory holds for calibration samples of arbitrary size, suggesting that uncertainty estimates with practically meaningful statistical guarantees can be achieved even if only small calibration sets are available. We question this promise by showing that, although the statistical guarantees hold for calibration sets of arbitrary size, the practical utility of these guarantees does highly depend on the size of the calibration set. This observation is relevant in medical domains because data is often scarce and obtaining large calibration sets is therefore infeasible.

In this paper, we perform an independent re-evaluation of these zero-shot claims using rigorous evaluation protocols while addressing potential sources of instrumentation bias. Our findings reveal a more nuanced picture: (1) deep learning methods perform comparably to iterative optimization on in-distribution T1w images and even on human-adjacent species (macaque), demonstrating improved task understanding; (2) however, performance degrades significantly on out-of-distribution contrasts (T2, T2*, FLAIR), with Cohen's d scores ranging from 0.7-1.5, indicating substantial practical impact on downstream clinical workflows; (3) deep learning methods face scalability limitations on high-resolution data, failing to run on 0.6 mm isotropic images, while iterative methods benefit from increased resolution; and (4) deep methods exhibit high sensitivity to preprocessing choices. These results align with the well-established literature on domain shift and suggest that claims of universal zero-shot superiority require careful scrutiny.

The approach includes establishing train alternative sets based on spatio-temporal constraints, data-driven adaptive trajectory inference, and trave l trajectory construction. To realize data-driven adaptive trajectory inference, a data-driven parameter estimation method based on KL divergence combined with EM algorithm (KLEM) was proposed.

Furthermore, to overcome the limitations of using synthetic data to validate the result, this paper employs real individual travel trajectory data for verification.

While watermarking has become an increasingly important mechanism to trace and protect digital media, most existing image watermarking schemes operate as black boxes, producing global detection scores without offering any insight into how or where the watermark is present. This lack of transparency impacts user trust and makes it difficult to interpret the impact of tampering. In this paper, we present a post-hoc image watermarking method that combines localised embedding with region-level interpretability. Our approach embeds watermark signals in the discrete wavelet transform domain using a statistical block-wise strategy. This allows us to generate detection maps that reveal which regions of an image are likely watermarked or altered. We show that our method achieves strong robustness against common image transformations while remaining sensitive to semantic manipulations. At the same time, the watermark remains highly imperceptible. Compared to prior post-hoc methods, our approach offers more interpretable detection while retaining competitive robustness. For example, our watermarks are robust to cropping up to half the image.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This limitation constrains the interpretability of automated social network analysis in commercial settings. We present a pose-based computational framework for interaction classification that moves beyond proximity heuristics by modeling the spatiotemporal geometry of anatomical keypoints. Rather than relying on pixel-level appearance or simple distance measures, the proposed method encodes interaction-specific motion signatures from keypoint trajectories, enabling differentiation of social interaction valence. The framework is implemented as an end-to-end computer vision pipeline integrating YOLOv11 for object detection (mAP@0.50: 96.24%), supervised individual identification (98.24% accuracy), ByteTrack for multi-object tracking (81.96% accuracy), ZebraPose for 27-point anatomical keypoint estimation, and a support vector machine classifier trained on pose-derived distance dynamics. On annotated interaction clips collected from a commercial dairy barn, the classifier achieved 77.51% accuracy in distinguishing affiliative and agonistic behaviors using pose information alone. Comparative evaluation against a proximity-only baseline shows substantial gains in behavioral discrimination, particularly for affiliative interactions.

This raises a fundamental question: what makes some questions more effective than others? To address this, a quantitative evaluation of question-generation models is essential. Video question generation (VQG) is a topic for video question answering (VideoQA), where questions are generated for given answers. Their evaluation typically focuses on the ability to answer questions, rather than the quality of generated questions. In contrast, we focus on the question quality in eliciting unseen knowledge from human experts. For a continuous improvement of VQG models, we propose a protocol that evaluates the ability by simulating question-answering communication with experts using a question-to-answer retrieval. We obtain the retriever by constructing a novel dataset, EgoExoAsk, which comprises 27,666 QA pairs generated from Ego-Exo4D's expert commentary annotation. The EgoExoAsk training set is used to obtain the retriever, and the benchmark is constructed on the validation set with Ego-Exo4D video segments. Experimental results demonstrate our metric reasonably aligns with question generation settings: models accessing richer context are evaluated better, supporting that our protocol works as intended.

We introduce a scenario-grounded benchmark that evaluates LLMs across biology, chemistry, materials, and physics, where domain experts define research projects of genuine interest and decompose them into modular research scenarios from which vetted questions are sampled. The framework assesses models at two levels: (i) question-level accuracy on scenario-tied items and (ii) project-level performance, where models must propose testable hypotheses, design simulations or experiments, and interpret results. Applying this two-phase scientific discovery evaluation (SDE) framework to state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a consistent performance gap relative to general science benchmarks, diminishing return of scaling up model sizes and reasoning, and systematic weaknesses shared across top-tier models from different providers. Large performance variation in research scenarios leads to changing choices of the best performing model on scientific discovery projects evaluated, suggesting all current LLMs are distant to general scientific \"superintelligence\". Nevertheless, LLMs already demonstrate promise in a great variety of scientific discovery projects, including cases where constituent scenario scores are low, highlighting the role of guided exploration and serendipity in discovery.

While efficient, this approach fails to incorporate a user's most recent actions, often resulting in stale recommendations. In this work, we present a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for intra-day personalization that selectively injects recent watch history at inference time without requiring model retraining. Our approach selectively overrides stale user features at inference time using the recent watch history, allowing the system to adapt instantly to evolving preferences. By reducing the personalization feedback loop from daily to intra-day, we observed a statistically significant 0.47% increase in key user engagement metrics which ranked among the most substantial engagement gains observed in recent experimentation cycles.

While the value alignment literature has developed techniques for shaping AI values, less attention has been paid to how to determine, under uncertainty, when imperfect alignment is good enough to justify delegation. We argue that rational delegation requires balancing an agent's value (mis)alignment with its epistemic accuracy and its reach (the acts it has available). This paper introduces a formal, decision-theoretic framework to analyze this tradeoff precisely accounting for a principal's uncertainty about these factors. Our analysis reveals a sharp distinction between two delegation scenarios. First, universal delegation (trusting an agent with any problem) demands near-perfect value alignment and total epistemic trust, conditions rarely met in practice. Second, we show that context-specific delegation can be optimal even with significant misalignment. An agent's superior accuracy or expanded reach may grant access to better overall decision problems, making delegation rational in expectation. We develop a novel scoring framework to quantify this ex ante decision. Ultimately, our work provides a principled method for determining when an AI is aligned enough for a given context, shifting the focus from achieving perfect alignment to managing the risks and rewards of delegation under uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6b63\u5f0f\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f55\u65f6\u5e94\u5c06\u51b3\u7b56\u59d4\u6258\u7ed9AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u8303\u56f4\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u6587\u732e\u8f83\u5c11\u5173\u6ce8\u5982\u4f55\u786e\u5b9a\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f55\u65f6\u975e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5bf9\u9f50\u5df2\u8db3\u591f\u5408\u7406\u4ee5\u8bc1\u660e\u59d4\u6258\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u6b63\u5f53\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u7406\u6027\u59d4\u6258\u6240\u9700\u6743\u8861\u7684\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6b63\u5f0f\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u8003\u8651\u59d4\u6258\u8005\u5bf9AI\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u8ba4\u77e5\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u4e8b\u524d\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u59d4\u6258\u60c5\u666f\u7684\u6839\u672c\u533a\u522b\uff1a\u901a\u7528\u59d4\u6258\u9700\u8981\u8fd1\u4e4e\u5b8c\u7f8e\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u5b8c\u5168\u8ba4\u77e5\u4fe1\u4efb\uff1b\u800c\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u5883\u59d4\u6258\u5373\u4f7f\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\uff0c\u53ea\u8981AI\u7684\u66f4\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6216\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u884c\u52a8\u8303\u56f4\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u786e\u5b9aAI\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u5883\u4e0b\u662f\u5426\u8db3\u591f\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u91cd\u70b9\u4ece\u8ffd\u6c42\u5b8c\u7f8e\u5bf9\u9f50\u8f6c\u5411\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7ba1\u7406\u59d4\u6258\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u6536\u76ca\u3002"}}

Consequently, a 3DGS super-resolution (SR) method is needed to bridge LR inputs and HR rendering. Early 3DGS SR methods rely on single-image SR networks, which lack cross-view consistency and fail to fuse complementary information across views. More recent video-based SR approaches attempt to address this limitation but require strictly sequential frames, limiting their applicability to unstructured multi-view datasets. In this work, we introduce Multi-View Consistent 3D Gaussian Splatting Super-Resolution (MVGSR), a framework that focuses on integrating multi-view information for 3DGS rendering with high-frequency details and enhanced consistency. We first propose an Auxiliary View Selection Method based on camera poses, making our method adaptable for arbitrarily organized multi-view datasets without the need of temporal continuity or data reordering. Furthermore, we introduce, for the first time, an epipolar-constrained multi-view attention mechanism into 3DGS SR, which serves as the core of our proposed multi-view SR network. This design enables the model to selectively aggregate consistent information from auxiliary views, enhancing the geometric consistency and detail fidelity of 3DGS representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both object-centric and scene-level 3DGS SR benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper proposes a method to measure high-frequency deformations by exploiting an event camera and LED markers. Firstly, observation noise is filtered based on the characteristics of the event stream generated by LED markers blinking and spatiotemporal correlation.

Attribution methods, which assign credit to input features, have proven effective for explaining the decision making of computer vision models. From these, context attributions have emerged as a promising approach for explaining the behavior of autoregressive LLMs. However, current context attributions produce incomplete explanations by directly relating generated tokens to the prompt, discarding inter-generational influence in the process. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce the Context Attribution via Graph Explanations (CAGE) framework. CAGE introduces an attribution graph: a directed graph that quantifies how each generation is influenced by both the prompt and all prior generations. The graph is constructed to preserve two properties-causality and row stochasticity. The attribution graph allows context attributions to be computed by marginalizing intermediate contributions along paths in the graph.

Decision calibration provides a novel framework for evaluating forecast performance at the decision level rather than the forecast level. We evaluate decision calibration to compare Machine Learning and classical numerical weather prediction models on various weather-dependent decision tasks. We find that model performance at the forecast level does not reliably translate to performance in downstream decision-making: some performance differences only become apparent at the decision level, and model rankings can change among different decision tasks.

High-fidelity lesion area and target organ segmentation constitutes a key component of the computer-assisted surgery workflow. The low contrast levels and noisy backgrounds of ultrasound videos cause missegmentation of organ boundary, which may lead to small object losses and increase boundary segmentation errors. Object tracking in long videos also remains a significant research challenge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a memory bank-based wavelet filtering and fusion network, which adopts an encoder-decoder structure to effectively extract fine-grained detailed spatial features and integrate high-frequency (HF) information. Specifically, memory-based wavelet convolution is presented to simultaneously capture category, detailed information and utilize adjacent information in the encoder. Cascaded wavelet compression is used to fuse multiscale frequency-domain features and expand the receptive field within each convolutional layer. A long short-term memory bank using cross-attention and memory compression mechanisms is designed to track objects in long video. To fully utilize the boundary-sensitive HF details of feature maps, an HF-aware feature fusion module is designed via adaptive wavelet filters in the decoder. In extensive benchmark tests conducted on four ultrasound video datasets (two thyroid nodule, the thyroid gland, the heart datasets) compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method demonstrates marked improvements in segmentation metrics. In particular, our method can more accurately segment small thyroid nodules, demonstrating its effectiveness for cases involving small ultrasound objects in long video.

Hence, the method generates multiple sub-models yielding a distribution of predictions to estimate uncertainty.

We find that MCD struggles to accurately reflect the underlying true uncertainty, particularly failing to capture increased uncertainty in extrapolation and interpolation regions as observed in Bayesian models.

A Mechanism Analysis and a New Dual-Activation Layer Proposal", "comment": null, "summary": "Fourier Analysis Network (FAN) was recently proposed as a simple way to improve neural network performance by replacing part of ReLU activations with sine and cosine functions. Although several studies have reported small but consistent gains across tasks, the underlying mechanism behind these improvements has remained unclear. In this work, we show that only the sine activation contributes positively to performance, whereas the cosine activation tends to be detrimental. Our analysis reveals that the improvement is not a consequence of the sine function's periodic nature; instead, it stems from the function's local behavior near x = 0, where its non-zero derivative mitigates the vanishing-gradient problem. We further show that FAN primarily alleviates the dying-ReLU problem, in which a neuron consistently receives negative inputs, produces zero gradients, and stops learning. Although modern ReLU-like activations, such as Leaky ReLU, GELU, and Swish, reduce ReLU's zero-gradient region, they still contain input domains where gradients remain significantly diminished, contributing to slower optimization and hindering rapid convergence. FAN addresses this limitation by introducing a more stable gradient pathway. This analysis shifts the understanding of FAN's benefits from a spectral interpretation to a concrete analysis of training dynamics, leading to the development of the Dual-Activation Layer (DAL), a more efficient convergence accelerator. We evaluate DAL on three tasks: classification of noisy sinusoidal signals versus pure noise, MNIST digit classification, and ECG-based biometric recognition. In all cases, DAL models converge faster and achieve equal or higher validation accuracy compared to models with conventional activations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although practitioners employ ad~hoc fixes such as real-data mixing, entropy bonuses, knowledge distillation, or retrieval-augmented generation, a single principle that explains both the failure mode and the success of these fixes has remained elusive. We present Entropy-Reservoir Bregman Projection (ERBP), an information-geometric framework that unifies these phenomena. We model the closed loop as a stochastic Bregman projection sequence in distribution space. Without external coupling, finite-sample noise forces the system to project onto an ever-shrinking empirical support, causing exponential entropy decay and eventual collapse. Introducing an Entropy Reservoir -- a high-entropy distribution mixed into each projection -- injects a controllable entropy flux that provably stabilises the dynamics. Our theory yields (i) a necessary condition for collapse, (ii) a sufficient condition that guarantees a non-trivial entropy floor, and (iii) closed-form rates that depend only on sample size and the strong-convexity/Lipschitz constants of the Bregman generator. Experiments on large-language-model self-training, Soft Actor-Critic in reinforcement learning, and GAN optimisation validate our predictions and show that disparate stabilisation heuristics correspond to specific reservoir choices and coupling coefficients.

While commercial products like Nano Banana Pro have garnered significant attention, their potential as generalist solvers for traditional low-level vision challenges remains largely underexplored. In this study, we investigate the critical question: Is Nano Banana Pro a Low-Level Vision All-Rounder? We conducted a comprehensive zero-shot evaluation across 14 distinct low-level tasks spanning 40 diverse datasets. By utilizing simple textual prompts without fine-tuning, we benchmarked Nano Banana Pro against state-of-the-art specialist models. Our extensive analysis reveals a distinct performance dichotomy: while \\textbf{Nano Banana Pro demonstrates superior subjective visual quality}, often hallucinating plausible high-frequency details that surpass specialist models, it lags behind in traditional reference-based quantitative metrics. We attribute this discrepancy to the inherent stochasticity of generative models, which struggle to maintain the strict pixel-level consistency required by conventional metrics.

Recent AIGC-based approaches partially automate asset creation and rigging, but they either inherit the heavy costs of full 3D pipelines or rely on video-synthesis paradigms that sacrifice 3D controllability and interactivity. We focus on single-image 3D animation generation and argue that progress is fundamentally constrained by a trade-off between rendering quality and 3D control.\n  To address this limitation, we propose a lightweight 3D animation framework that decouples geometric control from appearance synthesis. The core idea is a 2D-3D aligned proxy representation that uses a coarse 3D estimate as a structural carrier, while delegating high-fidelity appearance and view synthesis to learned image-space generative priors. This proxy formulation enables 3D-aware motion control and interaction comparable to classical pipelines, without requiring accurate geometry or expensive optimization, and naturally extends to coherent background animation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves efficient animation generation on low-power platforms and outperforms video-based 3D animation generation in identity preservation, geometric and textural consistency, and the level of precise, interactive control it offers to users.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In addition to its ability to handle time-based (temporal drift) scenarios, remarkably, OLR-WA stands out as the only model capable of effectively managing confidence-based challenging scenarios. It achieves this by adopting a conservative approach in its updates, giving priority to older data points with higher confidence levels.

However, we show that the off-policy nature of imitation learning for multi-turn LM agents suffers from the fundamental limitation known as covariate shift: as the student policy's behavior diverges from the expert's, it encounters states not present in the training data, reducing the effectiveness of fine-tuning. Taking inspiration from the classic DAgger algorithm, we propose a novel data generation methodology for addressing covariate shift for multi-turn LLM training. We introduce on-policy expert corrections (OECs), partially on-policy data generated by starting rollouts with a student model and then switching to an expert model part way through the trajectory. We explore the effectiveness of our data generation technique in the domain of software engineering (SWE) tasks, a multi-turn setting where LLM agents must interact with a development environment to fix software bugs. Our experiments compare OEC data against various other on-policy and imitation learning approaches on SWE agent problems and train models using a common rejection sampling (i.e., using environment reward) combined with supervised fine-tuning technique. Experiments find that OEC trajectories show a relative 14% and 13% improvement over traditional imitation learning in the 7b and 32b setting, respectively, on SWE-bench verified.

Therefore, we define a new Human Action Form Assessment (AFA) task, and introduce a new diverse dataset CoT-AFA, which contains a large scale of fitness and martial arts videos with multi-level annotations for comprehensive video analysis. We enrich the CoT-AFA dataset with a novel Chain-of-Thought explanation paradigm. Instead of offering isolated feedback, our explanations provide a complete reasoning process--from identifying an action step to analyzing its outcome and proposing a concrete solution. Furthermore, we propose a framework named Explainable Fitness Assessor, which can not only judge an action but also explain why and provide a solution. This framework employs two parallel processing streams and a dynamic gating mechanism to fuse visual and semantic information, thereby boosting its analytical capabilities. The experimental results demonstrate that our method has achieved improvements in explanation generation (e.g., +16.0% in CIDEr), action classification (+2.7% in accuracy) and quality assessment (+2.1% in accuracy), revealing great potential of CoT-AFA for future studies.

First, the accuracy of GNNs degrades when the graph is heterophilic. Second, iterative feature aggregation limits the scalability of GNNs to large graphs. We address these challenges by extracting topological information about graph communities at multiple levels of refinement, concatenating community assignments to the feature vector, and applying multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to the resulting representation. This provides topological context about nodes and their neighborhoods without invoking aggregation. Because MLPs are typically more scalable than GNNs, our approach applies to large graphs without the need for sampling.

Frameworks for \"thinking with images\" (e.g., ChatGPT-o3 and DeepEyes) show that stepwise multimodal reasoning can emerge by interleaving hypothesis formation with active acquisition of visual evidence, but they do not address three key challenges in spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT): building global space perception under strict token budgets, explicitly associating 3D hypotheses with video frames for verification, and designing spatially grounded rewards for reinforcement learning. To address these issues, we present EagleVision, a dual-stage framework for progressive spatial cognition through macro perception and micro verification. In the macro perception stage, EagleVision employs a semantics-perspective-fusion determinantal point process (SPF-DPP) to select a compact set of geometry- and semantics-aware keyframes from long videos under a fixed token budget. In the micro verification stage, we formalize spatial CoT as BEV-grounded pose querying: the agent iteratively predicts poses on a BEV plane, retrieves the nearest real frames, and is trained purely by reinforcement learning with a spatial grounding reward that scores the consistency between predicted poses and observed views. On VSI-Bench, EagleVision achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source vision-language models, demonstrating strong and generalizable spatial understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While numerous performance evaluation metrics exist for assessing perception capabilities, incorporating safety-specific metrics is essential to reliably evaluate object detection systems. A key component for safety evaluation is the ability to distinguish between relevant and non-relevant objects - a challenge addressed by criticality or relevance metrics. This paper presents the first in-depth analysis of criticality metrics for safety evaluation of object detection systems. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we identify and assess a range of applicable metrics. Their effectiveness is empirically validated using the DeepAccident dataset, which features a variety of safety-critical scenarios. To enhance evaluation accuracy, we propose two novel application strategies: bidirectional criticality rating and multi-metric aggregation.

Current deepfake detection methods are unreliable for two reasons: (i) distinguishing inauthentic content post-hoc is often impossible (e.g., with memorized samples), leading to an unbounded false positive rate (FPR); and (ii) detection lacks robustness, as adversaries can adapt to known detectors with near-perfect accuracy using minimal computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose a resynthesis framework to determine if a sample is authentic or if its authenticity can be plausibly denied. We make two key contributions focusing on the high-precision, low-recall setting against efficient (i.e., compute-restricted) adversaries.

While existing methods achieve promising results in the camera coordinate system by assuming zero camera rotation, this simplification leads to significant errors when transforming the reconstructed mesh to the world coordinate system. To address this challenge, we propose Mesh-Plug, a plug-and-play module that accurately transforms human meshes from camera coordinates to world coordinates. Our key innovation lies in a human-centered approach that leverages both RGB images and depth maps rendered from the initial mesh to estimate camera rotation parameters, eliminating the dependency on environmental cues. Specifically, we first train a camera rotation prediction module that focuses on the human body's spatial configuration to estimate camera pitch angle. Then, by integrating the predicted camera parameters with the initial mesh, we design a mesh adjustment module that simultaneously refines the root joint orientation and body pose. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark datasets SPEC-SYN and SPEC-MTP.", "AI": {"tldr": "Mesh-Plug\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u53ef\u5c06\u76f8\u673a\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e0b\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u7f51\u683c\u51c6\u786e\u8f6c\u6362\u5230\u4e16\u754c\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u76f8\u673a\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e3a\u96f6\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u673a\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u4e0b\u91cd\u5efa\u4eba\u4f53\u7f51\u683c\u6548\u679c\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u8f6c\u6362\u5230\u4e16\u754c\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u65f6\u8bef\u5dee\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u56e0\u4e3a\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f8\u673a\u65cb\u8f6c\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u76f8\u673a\u65cb\u8f6c\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5229\u7528RGB\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u521d\u59cb\u7f51\u683c\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eba\u4f53\u7a7a\u95f4\u914d\u7f6e\u4f30\u8ba1\u76f8\u673a\u4fef\u4ef0\u89d2\uff1b2\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u53c2\u6570\u4e0e\u521d\u59cb\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f51\u683c\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u6839\u5173\u8282\u65b9\u5411\u548c\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5728SPEC-SYN\u548cSPEC-MTP\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cMesh-Plug\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Mesh-Plug\u901a\u8fc7\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u76f8\u673a\u65cb\u8f6c\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u76f8\u673a\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u5230\u4e16\u754c\u5750\u6807\u7cfb\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u4eba\u4f53\u7f51\u683c\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u91ce\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d3D\u4eba\u4f53\u7f51\u683c\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Many of the tools commonly used for this purpose technical indicators, chart heuristics, or even sophisticated predictive models leave important questions unanswered. Technical indicators depend on platform-specific rules, and predictive systems typically offer little in terms of explanation. In settings that demand transparency or auditability, this poses a significant challenge. We introduce the Stock Pattern Assistant (SPA), a deterministic framework designed to extract monotonic price runs, attach relevant public events through a symmetric correlation window, and generate explanations that are factual, historical, and guardrailed. SPA relies only on daily OHLCV data and a normalized event stream, making the pipeline straight-forward to audit and easy to reproduce. To illustrate SPA's behavior in practice, we evaluate it across four equities-AAPL, NVDA, SCHW, and PGR-chosen to span a range of volatility regimes and sector characteristics. Although the evaluation period is modest, the results demonstrate how SPA consistently produces stable structural decompositions and contextual narratives. Ablation experiments further show how deterministic segmentation, event alignment, and constrained explanation each contribute to interpretability. SPA is not a forecasting system, nor is it intended to produce trading signals. Its value lies in offering a transparent, reproducible view of historical price structure that can complement analyst workflows, risk reviews, and broader explainable-AI pipelines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Prior work has demonstrated single-model collapse, defined as performance decay in an AI model trained on its own output. Inspired by ecology, we ask whether AI ecosystem diversity, that is, diversity among models, can mitigate such a collapse. We build on the single-model approach but focus on ecosystems of models trained on their collective output. To study the effect of diversity on model performance, we segment the training data across language models and evaluate the resulting ecosystems over ten, self-training iterations. We find that increased epistemic diversity mitigates collapse, but, interestingly, only up to an optimal level. Our results suggest that an ecosystem containing only a few diverse models fails to express the rich mixture of the full, true distribution, resulting in rapid performance decay. Yet distributing the data across too many models reduces each model's approximation capacity on the true distribution, leading to poor performance already in the first iteration step. In the context of AI monoculture, our results suggest the need to monitor diversity across AI systems and to develop policies that incentivize more domain- and community-specific models.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u591a\u6837\u6027\u53ef\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u77e5\u8bc6\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u6700\u4f18\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u8fc7\u591a\u6216\u8fc7\u5c11\u90fd\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u5d29\u6e83\u7684\u62c5\u5fe7\uff0c\u5373\u601d\u60f3\u8d8b\u4e8e\u540c\u8d28\u5316\u3002\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u5df1\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u8870\u51cf\u3002\u53d7\u751f\u6001\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u6837\u6027\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u51cf\u8f7b\u8fd9\u79cd\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7a76AI\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6700\u4f18\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6c34\u5e73", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5176\u96c6\u4f53\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u5206\u5272\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5341\u4e2a\u81ea\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fed\u4ee3\u5468\u671f\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "result": "\u589e\u52a0\u8ba4\u8bc6\u591a\u6837\u6027\u786e\u5b9e\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u5728\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u6c34\u5e73\u4e4b\u524d\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u53ea\u6709\u5c11\u6570\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u65e0\u6cd5\u8868\u8fbe\u5b8c\u6574\u771f\u5b9e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u8fc5\u901f\u8870\u51cf\uff1b2\uff09\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u5206\u914d\u5230\u592a\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b21\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\u5c31\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73", "conclusion": "\u5728AI\u5355\u4e00\u79cd\u690d\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u76d1\u63a7AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u95f4\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5e76\u5236\u5b9a\u653f\u7b56\u6fc0\u52b1\u66f4\u591a\u7279\u5b9a\u9886\u57df\u548c\u793e\u533a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55"}}

Although powerful approximations such as neural networks offer great expressiveness, they often present theoretical ambiguities, suffer from optimization instability and exploration difficulty, and incur substantial computational costs in practice. In this paper, we introduce the perspective of spectral representations as a solution to address these difficulties in RL. Stemming from the spectral decomposition of the transition operator, this framework yields an effective abstraction of the system dynamics for subsequent policy optimization while also providing a clear theoretical characterization. We reveal how to construct spectral representations for transition operators that possess latent variable structures or energy-based structures, which implies different learning methods to extract spectral representations from data. Notably, each of these learning methods realizes an effective RL algorithm under this framework. We also provably extend this spectral view to partially observable MDPs.

Such bias can lead to higher rates of inaccurate and missed diagnoses due to demographically skewed data and divergent distributions of diagnostic certainty. Current fairness interventions frequently fail to address these gaps or compromise overall diagnostic performance to achieve statistical parity among the subgroups. In this study, we developed Cross-Modal Alignment Consistency (CMAC-MMD), a training framework that standardises diagnostic certainty across intersectional patient subgroups. Unlike traditional debiasing methods, this approach equalises the model's decision confidence without requiring sensitive demographic data during clinical inference. We evaluated this approach using 10,015 skin lesion images (HAM10000) with external validation on 12,000 images (BCN20000), and 10,000 fundus images for glaucoma detection (Harvard-FairVLMed), stratifying performance by intersectional age, gender, and race attributes. In the dermatology cohort, the proposed method reduced the overall intersectional missed diagnosis gap (difference in True Positive Rate, $\u0394$TPR) from 0.50 to 0.26 while improving the overall Area Under the Curve (AUC) from 0.94 to 0.97 compared to standard training. Similarly, for glaucoma screening, the method reduced $\u0394$TPR from 0.41 to 0.31, achieving a better AUC of 0.72 (vs. 0.71 baseline).

In this study, we therefore systematically compare the performance of state-of-the-art specialized counting architectures against VLMs on two popular counting datasets, as well as on a novel benchmark specifically created to have a finer-grained control over the visual properties of test images. Our findings show that most VLMs can approximately enumerate the number of items in a visual scene, matching or even surpassing the performance of specialized computer vision architectures. Notably, enumeration accuracy significantly improves when VLMs are prompted to generate intermediate representations (i.e., locations and verbal labels) of each object to be counted.

Current detection methods rely on semantic similarity and natural language inference (NLI), but their fundamental limitations have not been rigorously characterized. We apply conformal prediction to hallucination detection, providing finite-sample coverage guarantees that enable precise quantification of detection capabilities. Using calibration sets of approximately 600 examples, we achieve 94% coverage with 0% false positive rate on synthetic hallucinations (Natural Questions). However, on three real hallucination benchmarks spanning multiple LLMs (GPT-4, ChatGPT, GPT-3, Llama-2, Mistral), embedding-based methods - including state-of-the-art OpenAI text-embedding-3-large and cross-encoder models - exhibit unacceptable false positive rates: 100% on HaluEval, 88% on RAGTruth, and 50% on WikiBio. Crucially, GPT-4 as an LLM judge achieves only 7% FPR (95% CI: [3.4%, 13.7%]) on the same data, proving the task is solvable through reasoning. We term this the \"semantic illusion\": semantically plausible hallucinations preserve similarity to source documents while introducing factual errors invisible to embeddings.

To achieve effective fusion, it is crucial to fully exploit the complementary information between the two modalities. Traditional CNN-based methods typically rely on channel-wise concatenation with fixed convolutional operators, which limits their adaptability to diverse spatial and spectral variations. While cross-attention mechanisms enable global interactions, they are computationally inefficient and may dilute fine-grained correspondences, making it difficult to capture complex semantic relationships. Recent advances in the Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) architecture have demonstrated impressive success in image generation and editing tasks. Unlike cross-attention, MMDiT employs in-context conditioning to facilitate more direct and efficient cross-modal information exchange. In this paper, we propose MMMamba, a cross-modal in-context fusion framework for pan-sharpening, with the flexibility to support image super-resolution in a zero-shot manner. Built upon the Mamba architecture, our design ensures linear computational complexity while maintaining strong cross-modal interaction capacity.

The resulting \\emph{P}hysics-\\emph{i}nformed \\emph{P}artition \\emph{P}enalty Deep Operator Network (PIP$^{2}$ Net) introduces a simplified and more principled partition penalty that improved the coordinated trunk outputs that leads to more expressiveness without sacrificing the flexibility of DeepONet. We evaluate PIP$^{2}$ Net on three nonlinear PDEs: the viscous Burgers equation, the Allen--Cahn equation, and a diffusion--reaction system. The results show that it consistently outperforms DeepONet, PI-DeepONet, and POU-DeepONet in prediction accuracy and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing automated quality assessment methods are largely limited to binary decisions and provide little interpretability. We introduce AutoMAC-MRI, an explainable framework for grading motion artifacts across heterogeneous MR contrasts and orientations.

Within this feature space, we compute grade-specific affinity scores that quantify an image's proximity to each motion grade, thereby making grade assignments transparent and interpretable. We evaluate AutoMAC-MRI on more than 5000 expert-annotated brain MRI slices spanning multiple contrasts and views. Experiments assessing affinity scores against expert labels show that the scores align well with expert judgment, supporting their use as an interpretable measure of motion severity.

To achieve this, graph convolution, which aggregates information from neighboring nodes, is commonly employed to encode node features and graph topology. However, excessive reliance on graph convolution can be suboptimal-especially in non-homophilic graphs-since it may yield unduly similar embeddings for nodes that differ in their features or topological properties. As a result, adjusting the degree of graph convolution usage has been actively explored in supervised learning settings, whereas such approaches remain underexplored in unsupervised scenarios. To tackle this, we propose FUEL, which adaptively learns the adequate degree of graph convolution usage by aiming to enhance intra-class similarity and inter-class separability in the embedding space. Since classes are unknown, FUEL leverages node features to identify node clusters and treats these clusters as proxies for classes. Through extensive experiments using 15 baseline methods and 14 benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of FUEL in downstream tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across graphs with diverse levels of homophily.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, a major drawback of this scheme is its tendency to overly generalize, primarily due to the similarities between input and supervisory signals. In order to address this issue, this paper introduces a novel technique called masked reverse knowledge distillation (MRKD). By employing image-level masking (ILM) and feature-level masking (FLM), MRKD transforms the task of image reconstruction into image restoration. Specifically, ILM helps to capture global information by differentiating input signals from supervisory signals. On the other hand, FLM incorporates synthetic feature-level anomalies to ensure that the learned representations contain sufficient local information. With these two strategies, MRKD is endowed with stronger image context capture capacity and is less likely to be overgeneralized. Experiments on the widely-used MVTec anomaly detection dataset demonstrate that MRKD achieves impressive performance: image-level 98.9% AU-ROC, pixel-level 98.4% AU-ROC, and 95.3% AU-PRO. In addition, extensive ablation experiments have validated the superiority of MRKD in mitigating the overgeneralization problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Another important capability is to read measurements from instruments and apparatus. Here, we tried to mimic a human inspired approach to read measurements from a linear scale.

To make the system efficient and robust, the area of interest is reduced to just the linear scale containing part of the image.

In this work, we investigate the trade-off through empirical studies, yielding two key observations. First, we discover the reward clustering phenomenon in which many trajectories collapse toward the group-mean reward, offering limited optimization value. Second, we design a heuristic strategy named Optimal Variance Filtering (OVF), and verify that a high-variance subset of trajectories, selected by OVF can outperform the larger, unfiltered group. However, this static, post-sampling OVF approach still necessitates critical computational overhead, as it performs unnecessary sampling for trajectories that are ultimately discarded. To resolve this, we propose Pro-GRPO (Proactive GRPO), a novel dynamic framework that integrates latent feature-based trajectory pruning into the sampling process. Through the early termination of reward-clustered trajectories, Pro-GRPO reduces computational overhead. Leveraging its efficiency, Pro-GRPO employs an \"Expand-and-Prune\" strategy. This strategy first expands the size of initial sampling group to maximize trajectory diversity, then it applies multi-step OVF to the latents, avoiding prohibitive computational costs. Extensive experiments on both diffusion-based and flow-based models demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our Pro-GRPO framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6458\u8981\u5206\u6790\u4e86Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) \u5728\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Pro-GRPO\u52a8\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65e9\u671f\u8f68\u8ff9\u4fee\u526a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "GRPO\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u7fa4\u4f53\u89c4\u6a21\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u63d0\u51fa\u9759\u6001\u7684Optimal Variance Filtering (OVF)\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u8f68\u8ff9\u5b50\u96c6\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51faPro-GRPO\u52a8\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u4fee\u526a\u5230\u91c7\u6837\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u91c7\u7528'\u6269\u5c55-\u4fee\u526a'\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5148\u6269\u5927\u521d\u59cb\u91c7\u6837\u7fa4\u4f53\u89c4\u6a21\u4ee5\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8f68\u8ff9\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u518d\u5bf9\u6f5c\u7279\u5f81\u5e94\u7528\u591a\u6b65OVF\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u548c\u6d41\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86Pro-GRPO\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Pro-GRPO\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8f68\u8ff9\u4fee\u526a\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86GRPO\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u679c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002"}}

The quality of these concept representations is typically evaluated in isolation, and under implicit independence assumptions that may not hold in practice. Thus, it is unclear whether common featurization methods - including sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and sparse probes - recover disentangled representations of these concepts. This study proposes a multi-concept evaluation setting where we control the correlations between textual concepts, such as sentiment, domain, and tense, and analyze performance under increasing correlations between them. We first evaluate the extent to which featurizers can learn disentangled representations of each concept under increasing correlational strengths. We observe a one-to-many relationship from concepts to features: features correspond to no more than one concept, but concepts are distributed across many features. Then, we perform steering experiments, measuring whether each concept is independently manipulable. Even when trained on uniform distributions of concepts, SAE features generally affect many concepts when steered, indicating that they are neither selective nor independent; nonetheless, features affect disjoint subspaces. These results suggest that correlational metrics for measuring disentanglement are generally not sufficient for establishing independence when steering, and that affecting disjoint subspaces is not sufficient for concept selectivity. These results underscore the importance of compositional evaluations in interpretability research.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Using a high-quality, long-term dataset, the study systematically compares the evaluation and temporal validation behavior of ensemble tree-based models (XGBoost, Random Forest) and deep learning approaches (LSTM, TCN).\n  While all models perform well on spatially split, conventional test sets, their performance degrades substantially on temporally independent validation years, revealing persistent limitations in generalization. Notably, models with strong test-set accuracy, but weak temporal validation performance can still produce seemingly credible SHAP feature importance values. This exposes a critical vulnerability in post hoc explainability methods: interpretability may appear reliable even when the underlying model fails to generalize.\n  These findings underscore the need for validation-aware interpretation of ML predictions in agricultural and environmental systems. Feature importance should not be accepted at face value unless models are explicitly shown to generalize to unseen temporal and spatial conditions.

Yet, the exchange of model updates between the participants and the aggregator can still leak sensitive information. In this work, we present a new gradient-based membership inference attack for federated learning scenarios that exploits the temporal evolution of last-layer gradients across multiple federated rounds. Our method uses the shadow technique to learn round-wise gradient patterns of the training records, requiring no access to the private dataset, and is designed to consider both semi-honest and malicious adversaries (aggregators or data owners). Beyond membership inference, we also provide a natural extension of the proposed attack to discrete attribute inference by contrasting gradient responses under alternative attribute hypotheses. The proposed attacks are model-agnostic, and therefore applicable to any gradient-based model and can be applied to both classification and regression settings. We evaluate the attack on CIFAR-100 and Purchase100 datasets for membership inference and on Breast Cancer Wisconsin for attribute inference. Our findings reveal strong attack performance and comparable computational and memory overhead in membership inference when compared to another attack from the literature. The obtained results emphasize that multi-round federated learning can increase the vulnerability to inference attacks, that aggregators pose a more substantial threat than data owners, and that attack performance is strongly influenced by the nature of the training dataset, with richer, high-dimensional data leading to stronger leakage than simpler tabular data.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Despite significant advances in player and ball tracking, pose estimation, action localization, and automatic foul recognition, anticipating actions before they occur in sports videos has received comparatively little attention. This work introduces the task of action anticipation in basketball broadcast videos, focusing on predicting which team will gain possession of the ball following a shot attempt. To benchmark this task, a new self-curated dataset comprising 100,000 basketball video clips, over 300 hours of footage, and more than 2,000 manually annotated rebound events is presented. Comprehensive baseline results are reported using state-of-the-art action anticipation methods, representing the first application of deep learning techniques to basketball rebound prediction.

For standard coordinate MLPs, limited input-feature interactions induce large eigenvalue dispersion and poor conditioning. We derive closed-form variance decompositions for common INR components and show that positional encoding reshapes input similarity, spherical normalization reduces variance via layerwise scaling, and Hadamard modulation introduces additional similarity factors strictly below one, yielding multiplicative variance reduction. This unified view explains how diverse INR architectures mitigate spectral bias by improving NTK conditioning.

Speculative decoding mitigates this cost through a draft-verify scheme, yet existing approaches rely on AR draft models (a.k.a., drafters), which introduce two fundamental issues: (1) step-wise uncertainty accumulation leads to a progressive collapse of trust between the target model and the drafter, and (2) inherently sequential decoding of AR drafters. Together, these factors cause limited speedups. In this paper, we show that a diffusion large language model (dLLM) drafters can naturally overcome these issues through its fundamentally different probabilistic modeling and efficient parallel decoding strategy. Building on this insight, we introduce DEER, an efficient speculative decoding framework that drafts with diffusion and verifies with AR models. To enable high-quality drafting, DEER employs a two-stage training pipeline to align the dLLM-based drafters with the target AR model, and further adopts single-step decoding to generate long draft segments. Experiments show DEER reaches draft acceptance lengths of up to 32 tokens, far surpassing the 10 tokens achieved by EAGLE-3. Moreover, on HumanEval with Qwen3-30B-A3B, DEER attains a 5.54x speedup, while EAGLE-3 achieves only 2.41x.

We investigate whether preserving marker independence, combined with deliberately shallow architectures, provides a more suitable inductive bias for self-supervised representation learning in multiplex data than increasing model scale. Using a Hodgkin lymphoma CODEX dataset with 145,000 cells and 49 markers, we compare standard early-fusion CNNs with channel-separated architectures, including a marker-aware baseline and our novel shallow Channel-Independent Model (CIM-S) with 5.5K parameters. After contrastive pretraining and linear evaluation, early-fusion models show limited ability to retain marker-specific information and struggle particularly with rare-cell discrimination. Channel-independent architectures, and CIM-S in particular, achieve substantially stronger representations despite their compact size. These findings are consistent across multiple self-supervised frameworks, remain stable across augmentation settings, and are reproducible across both the 49-marker and reduced 18-marker settings.

Traditional domain adaptation or generalization methods often ignore such context information or use simplistic integration strategies, making them ineffective in handling unseen context shifts after deployment. In this paper, we propose Chorus, a context-aware, data-free model customization approach that adapts models to unseen deployment conditions without requiring target-domain data. The key idea is to learn effective context representations that capture their influence on sensor data patterns and to adaptively integrate them based on the degree of context shift. Specifically, Chorus first performs unsupervised cross-modal reconstruction between unlabeled sensor data and language-based context embeddings, while regularizing the context embedding space to learn robust, generalizable context representations. Then, it trains a lightweight gated head on limited labeled samples to dynamically balance sensor and context contributions-favoring context when sensor evidence is ambiguous and vice versa. To further reduce inference latency, Chorus employs a context-caching mechanism that reuses cached context representations and updates only upon detected context shifts.

We term this failure the 3D Mirage. This paper introduces the first end-to-end framework to probe, quantify, and tame this unquantified safety risk. To probe, we present 3D-Mirage, the first benchmark of real-world illusions (e.g., street art) with precise planar-region annotations and context-restricted crops. To quantify, we propose a Laplacian-based evaluation framework with two metrics: the Deviation Composite Score (DCS) for spurious non-planarity and the Confusion Composite Score (CCS) for contextual instability.

We introduce a self-evolving training pipeline powered by the Calibrated Step Reward System, which converts model-generated trajectories into reliable training signals through trajectory-level calibration, achieving >90% annotation accuracy with 10-100x lower cost. Leveraging this pipeline, we introduce Step-GUI, a family of models (4B/8B) that achieves state-of-the-art GUI performance (8B: 80.2% AndroidWorld, 48.5% OSWorld, 62.6% ScreenShot-Pro) while maintaining robust general capabilities. As GUI agent capabilities improve, practical deployment demands standardized interfaces across heterogeneous devices while protecting user privacy. To this end, we propose GUI-MCP, the first Model Context Protocol for GUI automation with hierarchical architecture that combines low-level atomic operations and high-level task delegation to local specialist models, enabling high-privacy execution where sensitive data stays on-device. Finally, to assess whether agents can handle authentic everyday usage, we introduce AndroidDaily, a benchmark grounded in real-world mobile usage patterns with 3146 static actions and 235 end-to-end tasks across high-frequency daily scenarios (8B: static 89.91%, end-to-end 52.50%).

Once leaked, these templates pose a threat: inverting them can yield photorealistic surrogates that compromise privacy and enable impersonation. Although existing research has achieved relatively realistic face template inversion, the reconstructed facial images exhibit over-smoothed facial-part attributes (eyes, nose, mouth) and limited transferability. To address this problem, we present CLIP-FTI, a CLIP-driven fine-grained attribute conditioning framework for face template inversion. Our core idea is to use the CLIP model to obtain the semantic embeddings of facial features, in order to realize the reconstruction of specific facial feature attributes. Specifically, facial feature attribute embeddings extracted from CLIP are fused with the leaked template via a cross-modal feature interaction network and projected into the intermediate latent space of a pretrained StyleGAN. The StyleGAN generator then synthesizes face images with the same identity as the templates but with more fine-grained facial feature attributes. Experiments across multiple face recognition backbones and datasets show that our reconstructions (i) achieve higher identification accuracy and attribute similarity, (ii) recover sharper component-level attribute semantics, and (iii) improve cross-model attack transferability compared to prior reconstruction attacks. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first method to use additional information besides the face template attack to realize face template inversion and obtains SOTA results.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we adapt the CBraMod encoder for large-scale self-supervised ECG pretraining, introducing a dual-masking strategy to capture intra- and inter-lead dependencies. To overcome the above challenges, we utilize a pre-trained CBraMod encoder for EEG and pre-train a symmetric ECG encoder, equipping each modality with a rich foundational representation. These representations are then fused via simple embedding concatenation, allowing the classification head to learn cross-modal interactions, together enabling effective downstream learning despite limited multi-modal supervision. Evaluated on emotion recognition, our approach achieves near state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that carefully designed physiological encoders, even with straightforward fusion, substantially improve downstream performance.

This study investigates the effectiveness of two individual deep learning architectures ResNet-101 and Inception v3 for wildlife object detection under such complex conditions. The models were trained and evaluated on a wildlife image dataset using a standardized preprocessing approach, which included resizing images to a maximum dimension of 800 pixels, converting them to RGB format, and transforming them into PyTorch tensors. A ratio of 70:30 training and validation split was used for model development. The ResNet-101 model achieved a classification accuracy of 94% and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.91, showing strong performance in extracting deep hierarchical features. The Inception v3 model performed slightly better, attaining a classification accuracy of 95% and a mAP of 0.92, attributed to its efficient multi-scale feature extraction through parallel convolutions. Despite the strong results, both models exhibited challenges when detecting species with similar visual characteristics or those captured under poor lighting and occlusion.

Multi-view learning-based approaches mitigate these issues but often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios, as large-scale multi-view datasets with 3D ground truth are scarce and captured under constrained conditions. To overcome this limitation, recent methods rely on 2D pose estimation combined with 2D-to-3D pose lifting trained on synthetic data. Building on our previous MPL framework, we propose RUMPL, a transformer-based 3D pose lifter that introduces a 3D ray-based representation of 2D keypoints. This formulation makes the model independent of camera calibration and the number of views, enabling universal deployment across arbitrary multi-view configurations without retraining or fine-tuning. A new View Fusion Transformer leverages learned fused-ray tokens to aggregate information along rays, further improving multi-view consistency.

We revisit the long-standing intuition that different representations capture complementary structure and show that selectively fusing them can yield consistent improvements over Rocket on specific, systematically identifiable kinds of datasets. We introduce Fusion-3 (F3), a lightweight framework that adaptively fuses Rocket, Sax, and Sfa representations. To understand when fusion helps, we cluster UCR datasets into six groups using meta-features capturing series length, spectral structure, roughness, and class imbalance, and treat these clusters as interpretable data-structure regimes. Our analysis shows that fusion typically outperforms strong baselines in regimes with structured variability or rich frequency content, while offering diminishing returns in highly irregular or outlier-heavy settings. To support these findings, we combine three complementary analyses: non-parametric paired statistics across datasets, ablation studies isolating the roles of individual representations, and attribution via SHAP to identify which dataset properties predict fusion gains. Sample-level case studies further reveal the underlying mechanism: fusion primarily improves performance by rescuing specific errors, with adaptive increases in frequency-domain weighting precisely where corrections occur. Using 5-fold cross-validation on the 113 UCR datasets, F3 yields small but consistent average improvements over Rocket, supported by frequentist and Bayesian evidence and accompanied by clearly identifiable failure cases.

Recent approaches tend to adopt diffusion-based image/video generation models for realistic and expressive animation. However, none of these diffusion models realizes high-fidelity disentangled control between the head pose and facial expression, hindering applications like expression-only or pose-only editing and animation. To address this, we propose DeX-Portrait, a novel approach capable of generating expressive portrait animation driven by disentangled pose and expression signals. Specifically, we represent the pose as an explicit global transformation and the expression as an implicit latent code. First, we design a powerful motion trainer to learn both pose and expression encoders for extracting precise and decomposed driving signals.

Machine learning (ML) offers a data-driven alternative for centralized fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL), enabling faster and more adaptive decision-making. However, practical deployment critically depends on robustness. Protection algorithms must remain reliable even when confronted with missing, noisy, or degraded sensor data. This work introduces a unified framework for systematically evaluating the robustness of ML models in power system protection.\n  High-fidelity EMT simulations are used to model realistic degradation scenarios, including sensor outages, reduced sampling rates, and transient communication losses. The framework provides a consistent methodology for benchmarking models, quantifying the impact of limited observability, and identifying critical measurement channels required for resilient operation. Results show that FC remains highly stable under most degradation types but drops by about 13% under single-phase loss, while FL is more sensitive overall, with voltage loss increasing localization error by over 150%. These findings offer actionable guidance for robustness-aware design of future ML-assisted protection systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Yu Zhou"], "title": "EmoCaliber: Advancing Reliable Visual Emotion Comprehension via Confidence Verbalization and Calibration", "comment": null, "summary": "Visual Emotion Comprehension (VEC) aims to infer sentiment polarities or emotion categories from affective cues embedded in images. In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have established a popular paradigm in VEC, leveraging their generalizability to unify VEC tasks defined under diverse emotion taxonomies. While this paradigm achieves notable success, it typically formulates VEC as a deterministic task, requiring the model to output a single, definitive emotion label for each image. Such a formulation insufficiently accounts for the inherent subjectivity of emotion perception, overlooking alternative interpretations that may be equally plausible to different viewers. To address this limitation, we propose equipping MLLMs with capabilities to verbalize their confidence in emotion predictions. This additional signal provides users with an estimate of both the plausibility of alternative interpretations and the MLLMs' self-assessed competence, thereby enhancing reliability in practice. Building on this insight, we introduce a three-stage training framework that progressively endows with structured reasoning, teaches to verbalize confidence, and calibrates confidence expression, culminating in EmoCaliber, a confidence-aware MLLM for VEC. Through fair and comprehensive evaluations on the unified benchmark VECBench, EmoCaliber demonstrates overall superiority against existing methods in both emotion prediction and confidence estimation. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and mark a feasible step toward more reliable VEC systems.

To fully exploit the potential of such models, a significant focus has been given to the collection of large amounts of training data that cover multiple remote sensing-specific tasks, such as image captioning or visual question answering. However, the cost of using and training LVLMs is high, due to the large number of parameters. While multiple parameter-efficient adaptation techniques have been explored, the computational costs of training and inference with these models can remain prohibitive for most institutions. In this work, we explore the use of encoder-only architectures and propose a model that can effectively address multi-task learning while remaining compact in terms of the number of parameters. In particular, our model tackles combinations of tasks that are not typically explored in a unified model: the generation of text from remote sensing images and cross-modal retrieval. The results of our GeoMELT model - named from Multi-task Efficient Learning Transformer - in established benchmarks confirm the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Despite recent success, existing flow-based approaches are challenged by their inefficiency, as they require large-scale datasets often with restrictive pairing constraints, incur high computational cost from modeling joint distribution, and rely on complex multi-stage training. We propose FlowBind, an efficient framework for any-to-any generation. Our approach is distinguished by its simplicity: it learns a shared latent space capturing cross-modal information, with modality-specific invertible flows bridging this latent to each modality. Both components are optimized jointly under a single flow-matching objective, and at inference the invertible flows act as encoders and decoders for direct translation across modalities. By factorizing interactions through the shared latent, FlowBind naturally leverages arbitrary subsets of modalities for training, and achieves competitive generation quality while substantially reducing data requirements and computational cost. Experiments on text, image, and audio demonstrate that FlowBind attains comparable quality while requiring up to 6x fewer parameters and training 10x faster than prior methods.

However, its development has been hindered by two major challenges: the lack of an efficient evaluation framework that reliably predicts downstream generation performance, and the difficulty of effectively adapting pretrained language models for visual synthesis. To address these issues, we introduce GRAN-TED, a paradigm to Generate Robust, Aligned, and Nuanced Text Embeddings for Diffusion models. Our contribution is twofold. First, we propose TED-6K, a novel text-only benchmark that enables efficient and robust assessment of an encoder's representational quality without requiring costly end-to-end model training. We demonstrate that performance on TED-6K, standardized via a lightweight, unified adapter, strongly correlates with an encoder's effectiveness in downstream generation tasks. Second, guided by this validated framework, we develop a superior text encoder using a novel two-stage training paradigm. This process involves an initial fine-tuning stage on a Multimodal Large Language Model for better visual representation, followed by a layer-wise weighting method to extract more nuanced and potent text features. Our experiments show that the resulting GRAN-TED encoder not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on TED-6K but also leads to demonstrable performance gains in text-to-image and text-to-video generation.

This motivates effective adaptation under limited supervision. SAM3 concept-driven framework generates masks from textual prompts without requiring task-specific modifications, which may enable this adaptation. We evaluate SAM3 for RS imagery across four target types, comparing textual, geometric, and hybrid prompting strategies, under lightweight fine-tuning scales with increasing supervision, alongside zero-shot inference. Results show that combining semantic and geometric cues yields the highest performance across targets and metrics. Text-only prompting exhibits the lowest performance, with marked score gaps for irregularly shaped targets, reflecting limited semantic alignment between SAM3 textual representations and their overhead appearances. Nevertheless, textual prompting with light fine-tuning offers a practical performance-effort trade-off for geometrically regular and visually salient targets. Across targets, performance improves between zero-shot inference and fine-tuning, followed by diminishing returns as the supervision scale increases. Namely, a modest geometric annotation effort is sufficient for effective adaptation. A persistent gap between Precision and IoU further indicates that under-segmentation and boundary inaccuracies remain prevalent error patterns in RS tasks, particularly for irregular and less prevalent targets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, choosing the length of the rollouts poses two dilemmas: (1) Longer rollouts better preserve on-policy training but amplify model bias, indicating the need for an intermediate horizon to mitigate distribution shift (i.e., the gap between on-policy and past off-policy samples). (2) Moreover, a longer model rollout may reduce value estimation bias but raise the variance of policy gradients due to backpropagation through multiple steps, implying another intermediate horizon for stable gradient estimates. However, these two optimal horizons may differ. To resolve this conflict, we propose Double Horizon Model-Based Policy Optimization (DHMBPO), which divides the rollout procedure into a long \"distribution rollout\" (DR) and a short \"training rollout\" (TR). The DR generates on-policy state samples for mitigating distribution shift. In contrast, the short TR leverages differentiable transitions to offer accurate value gradient estimation with stable gradient updates, thereby requiring fewer updates and reducing overall runtime. We demonstrate that the double-horizon approach effectively balances distribution shift, model bias, and gradient instability, and surpasses existing MBRL methods on continuous-control benchmarks in terms of both sample efficiency and runtime.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing distillation methods typically transfer modality-specific features directly to each sensor, which can distort their unique characteristics and degrade their individual strengths. To address this, we introduce IMKD, a radar-camera fusion framework based on multi-level knowledge distillation that preserves each sensor's intrinsic characteristics while amplifying their complementary strengths. IMKD applies a three-stage, intensity-aware distillation strategy to enrich the fused representation across the architecture: (1) LiDAR-to-Radar intensity-aware feature distillation to enhance radar representations with fine-grained structural cues, (2) LiDAR-to-Fused feature intensity-guided distillation to selectively highlight useful geometry and depth information at the fusion level, fostering complementarity between the modalities rather than forcing them to align, and (3) Camera-Radar intensity-guided fusion mechanism that facilitates effective feature alignment and calibration. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that IMKD reaches 67.0% NDS and 61.0% mAP, outperforming all prior distillation-based radar-camera fusion methods.

Despite extensive research, the question of how to characterize and assess the risk of DRAs in FL systems remains unresolved due to the lack of a theoretically-grounded risk quantification framework. In this work, we address this gap by introducing Invertibility Loss (InvLoss) to quantify the maximum achievable effectiveness of DRAs for a given data instance and FL model. We derive a tight and computable upper bound for InvLoss and explore its implications from three perspectives. First, we show that DRA risk is governed by the spectral properties of the Jacobian matrix of exchanged model updates or feature embeddings, providing a unified explanation for the effectiveness of defense methods. Second, we develop InvRE, an InvLoss-based DRA risk estimator that offers attack method-agnostic, comprehensive risk evaluation across data instances and model architectures. Third, we propose two adaptive noise perturbation defenses that enhance FL privacy without harming classification accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate our framework, demonstrating its potential for systematic DRA risk evaluation and mitigation in FL systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A core challenge lies in the limited availability of multi-view data and the tendency of monocular training to yield incomplete 3D head reconstructions. We identify the root cause of this issue as the entanglement between driving signal and target viewpoint when learning from monocular videos. To address this, we propose a transformer-based 3D portrait animation model with learnable data source tokens, so-called bias sinks, which enables unified training across monocular and multi-view datasets. This design leverages the strengths of both data sources during inference: strong generalization from monocular data and full 3D completeness from multi-view supervision. Furthermore, our training procedure yields a smooth latent avatar space that facilitates identity interpolation and flexible fitting to an arbitrary number of input observations. In extensive evaluations on single-view, few-shot, and monocular avatar creation tasks, we verify the efficacy of FlexAvatar. Many existing methods struggle with view extrapolation while FlexAvatar generates complete 3D head avatars with realistic facial animations.

In contrast, professional design tools employ layered representations, allowing isolated edits while preserving consistency. Motivated by this, we propose \\textbf{Qwen-Image-Layered}, an end-to-end diffusion model that decomposes a single RGB image into multiple semantically disentangled RGBA layers, enabling \\textbf{inherent editability}, where each RGBA layer can be independently manipulated without affecting other content. To support variable-length decomposition, we introduce three key components: (1) an RGBA-VAE to unify the latent representations of RGB and RGBA images; (2) a VLD-MMDiT (Variable Layers Decomposition MMDiT) architecture capable of decomposing a variable number of image layers; and (3) a Multi-stage Training strategy to adapt a pretrained image generation model into a multilayer image decomposer. Furthermore, to address the scarcity of high-quality multilayer training images, we build a pipeline to extract and annotate multilayer images from Photoshop documents (PSD). Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses existing approaches in decomposition quality and establishes a new paradigm for consistent image editing.

In this paper, we introduce a robust method for pose estimation and calibration. We consider a set of rigid cameras, each observing the scene from a different perspective, which is a typical camera setup in animal behavior studies and forensic analysis of surveillance footage. Specifically, we analyse the individual components in a structure-from-motion (SfM) pipeline, and identify design choices that improve accuracy. Our main contributions are: (1) we investigate how to best subsample the predicted correspondences from a dense matcher to leverage them in the estimation process. (2) We investigate selection criteria for how to add the views incrementally. In a rigorous quantitative evaluation, we show the effectiveness of our changes, especially for cameras with strong radial distortion (79.9% ours vs. 40.4 vanilla VGGT). Finally, we demonstrate our correspondence subsampling in a global SfM setting where we initialize the poses using VGGT. The proposed pipeline generalizes across a wide range of camera setups, and could thus become a useful tool for animal behavior and forensic analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

For long-horizon rollouts we show that the soft inductive bias of our models results in better performance in terms of physical fidelity compared to non-equivariant baseline models. The approach complements recent soft-equivariance ideas and aligns with the view that simple, well-chosen priors can yield robust generalization.

Space-based sensing will enable inspection of RSOs at shorter ranges, independent of atmospheric effects, and from all aspects. The use of a sub-THz inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging and sensing system for SDA has been proposed in previous work, demonstrating the achievement of sub-cm image resolution at ranges of up to 100 km. This work focuses on recognition of external structures by use of sequential feature detection and tracking throughout the aligned ISAR images of the satellites. The Hough transform is employed to detect linear features, which are tracked throughout the sequence. ISAR imagery is generated via a metaheuristic simulator capable of modelling encounters for a variety of deployment scenarios. Initial frame-to-frame alignment is achieved through a series of affine transformations to facilitate later association between image features. A gradient-by-ratio method is used for edge detection within individual ISAR images, and edge magnitude and direction are subsequently used to inform a double-weighted Hough transform to detect features with high accuracy. Feature evolution during sequences of frames is analysed. It is shown that the use of feature tracking within sequences with the proposed approach will increase confidence in feature detection and classification, and an example use-case of robust detection of shadowing as a feature is presented.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce a new concept of 4D Occupancy Spatio-Temporal Persistence (OccSTeP), which aims to address two tasks: (1) reactive forecasting: ''what will happen next'' and (2) proactive forecasting: \"what would happen given a specific future action\". For the first time, we create a new OccSTeP benchmark with challenging scenarios (e.g., erroneous semantic labels and dropped frames). To address this task, we propose OccSTeP-WM, a tokenizer-free world model that maintains a dense voxel-based scene state and incrementally fuses spatio-temporal context over time. OccSTeP-WM leverages a linear-complexity attention backbone and a recurrent state-space module to capture long-range spatial dependencies while continually updating the scene memory with ego-motion compensation. This design enables online inference and robust performance even when historical sensor input is missing or noisy. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of the OccSTeP concept and our OccSTeP-WM, yielding an average semantic mIoU of 23.70% (+6.56% gain) and occupancy IoU of 35.89% (+9.26% gain).

However, existing video editing models fail to satisfy these requirements. IC-Effect leverages the source video as clean contextual conditions, exploiting the contextual learning capability of DiT models to achieve precise background preservation and natural effect injection. A two-stage training strategy, consisting of general editing adaptation followed by effect-specific learning via Effect-LoRA, ensures strong instruction following and robust effect modeling. To further improve efficiency, we introduce spatiotemporal sparse tokenization, enabling high fidelity with substantially reduced computation.

For instance, ecosystem structures evolve due to interactions among plants, herbivores, and carnivores; the spatial distribution of crimes shifts in response to societal changes; and word embedding vectors reflect cultural and semantic trends over time. However, analyzing such time-varying sets of vectors is challenging due to their complicated structures, which also evolve over time. In this work, we propose a novel method for modeling the distribution underlying each set of vectors using infinite-dimensional Gaussian processes. By approximating the latent function in the Gaussian process with Random Fourier Features, we obtain compact and comparable vector representations over time.

They enable captivating visual arts, immersive virtual reality, and a wide range of engineering and scientific applications. Recent works have extended sky-models to be more comprehensive and inclusive of cloud formations but, as we demonstrate, existing methods fall short in faithfully recreating natural skies. Though in recent years the visual quality of DNN-generated High Dynamic Range Imagery (HDRI) has greatly improved, the environment maps generated by DNN sky-models do not re-light scenes with the same tones, shadows, and illumination as physically captured HDR imagery. In this work, we demonstrate progress in HDR literature to be tangential to sky-modelling as current works cannot support both photorealism and the 22 f-stops required for the Full Dynamic Range (FDR) of outdoor illumination. We achieve this by proposing AllSky, a flexible all-weather sky-model learned directly from physically captured HDRI which we leverage to study the input modalities, tonemapping, conditioning, and evaluation of sky-models. Per user-controlled positioning of the sun and cloud formations, AllSky expands on current functionality by allowing for intuitive user control over environment maps and achieves state-of-the-art sky-model performance. Through our proposed evaluation, we demonstrate existing DNN sky-models are not interchangeable with physically captured HDRI or parametric sky-models, with current limitations being prohibitive of scalability and accurate illumination in downstream applications", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A noteworthy solution is vision-text compression (VTC), exemplified by frameworks like DeepSeek-OCR and Glyph, which convert long texts into dense 2D visual representations, thereby achieving token compression ratios of 3x-20x. However, the impact of this high information density on the core long-context capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) remains under-investigated. To address this gap, we introduce the first benchmark for VTC and systematically assess the performance of VLMs across three long-context understanding settings: VTC-Retrieval, which evaluates the model's ability to retrieve and aggregate information; VTC-Reasoning, which requires models to infer latent associations to locate facts with minimal lexical overlap; and VTC-Memory, which measures comprehensive question answering within long-term dialogue memory. Furthermore, we establish the VTCBench-Wild to simulate diverse input scenarios.We comprehensively evaluate leading open-source and proprietary models on our benchmarks. The results indicate that, despite being able to decode textual information (e.g., OCR) well, most VLMs exhibit a surprisingly poor long-context understanding ability with VTC-compressed information, failing to capture long associations or dependencies in the context.This study provides a deep understanding of VTC and serves as a foundation for designing more efficient and scalable VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u591a\u6570VLMs\u5bf9\u7ecf\u8fc7\u89c6\u89c9\u6587\u672c\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u957f\u671f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u957f\u5173\u8054\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u6587\u672c\u538b\u7f29\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u538b\u7f29\u6587\u672c\uff083x-20x\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9VLMs\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u521b\u5efa\u9996\u4e2aVTC\u57fa\u51c6\u4ee5\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2aVTC\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u4e09\u4e2a\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u573a\u666f\uff1aVTC-Retrieval\uff08\u68c0\u7d22\u805a\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u3001VTC-Reasoning\uff08\u8054\u60f3\u8bcd\u4e49\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff09\u3001VTC-Memory\uff08\u957f\u671f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u95ee\u7b54\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acbVTCBench-Wild\u6a21\u62df\u591a\u79cd\u8f93\u5165\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5bf9\u9886\u5148\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5927\u591a\u6570VLMs\u80fd\u8f83\u597d\u89e3\u7801\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5982OCR\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9VTC\u538b\u7f29\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u8f83\u5dee\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u957f\u5173\u8054\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u4e86VTC\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684VLMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u4e5f\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524dVLMs\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u3002"}}

However, when dealing with unlabeled incomplete multi-view data, where some samples are missing in certain views, existing methods typically first impute the missing data and then concatenate all views into a single dataset for subsequent co-selection. Such a strategy treats co-selection and missing data imputation as two independent processes, overlooking potential interactions between them. The inter-sample relationships gleaned from co-selection can aid imputation, which in turn enhances co-selection performance. Additionally, simply merging multi-view data fails to capture the complementary information among views, ultimately limiting co-selection effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose a novel co-selection method, termed Joint learning of Unsupervised multI-view feature and instance Co-selection with cross-viEw imputation (JUICE). JUICE first reconstructs incomplete multi-view data using available observations, bringing missing data recovery and feature and instance co-selection together in a unified framework. Then, JUICE leverages cross-view neighborhood information to learn inter-sample relationships and further refine the imputation of missing values during reconstruction. This enables the selection of more representative features and instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JUICE outperforms state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Entropy bonuses and external semantic comparators encourage surface level variation but offer no guarantee that sampled trajectories differ in the update directions that shape optimization. We propose G2RL, a gradient guided reinforcement learning framework in which exploration is driven not by external heuristics but by the model own first order update geometry. For each response, G2RL constructs a sequence level feature from the model final layer sensitivity, obtainable at negligible cost from a standard forward pass, and measures how each trajectory would reshape the policy by comparing these features within a sampled group. Trajectories that introduce novel gradient directions receive a bounded multiplicative reward scaler, while redundant or off manifold updates are deemphasized, yielding a self referential exploration signal that is naturally aligned with PPO style stability and KL control. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks (MATH500, AMC, AIME24, AIME25, GPQA, MMLUpro) on Qwen3 base 1.7B and 4B models, G2RL consistently improves pass@1, maj@16, and pass@k over entropy based GRPO and external embedding methods.

However, standard masked diffusion language model (MDLM) training fails to reliably induce this behavior, as models often cannot identify unreliable tokens in a complete input, rendering confidence-guided refinement ineffective. We study corrective behavior in diffusion language models, defined as the ability to assign lower confidence to incorrect tokens and iteratively refine them while preserving correct content. We show that this capability is not induced by conventional masked diffusion objectives and propose a correction-oriented post-training principle that explicitly supervises visible incorrect tokens, enabling error-aware confidence and targeted refinement. To evaluate corrective behavior, we introduce the Code Revision Benchmark (CRB), a controllable and executable benchmark for assessing error localization and in-place correction. Experiments on code revision tasks and controlled settings demonstrate that models trained with our approach substantially outperform standard MDLMs in correction scenarios, while also improving pure completion performance.

A common challenge in current methods, however, is the occurrence of Spatial Relationship Hallucinations between the foreground subject and the generated background, including inappropriate scale, positional relationships, and viewpoints. Critically, the subjective nature of spatial rationality makes it challenging to quantify, hindering the use of traditional reward-based RLHF methods. To address this issue, we propose InpaintDPO, the first Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) based framework dedicated to spatial rationality in foreground-conditioned inpainting, ensuring plausible spatial relationships between foreground and background elements. To resolve the gradient conflicts in standard DPO caused by identical foreground in win-lose pairs, we propose MaskDPO, which confines preference optimization exclusively to the background to enhance background spatial relationships, while retaining the inpainting loss in the foreground region for robust foreground preservation. To enhance coherence at the foreground-background boundary, we propose Conditional Asymmetric Preference Optimization, which samples pairs with differentiated cropping operations and applies global preference optimization to promote contextual awareness and enhance boundary coherence. Finally, based on the observation that winning samples share a commonality in plausible spatial relationships, we propose Shared Commonality Preference Optimization to enhance the model's understanding of spatial commonality across high-quality winning samples, further promoting shared spatial rationality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86InpaintDPO\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u524d\u666f\u6761\u4ef6\u4fee\u590d\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7MaskDPO\u3001\u6761\u4ef6\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u5171\u6027\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u589e\u5f3a\u524d\u666f\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5408\u7406\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u524d\u666f\u6761\u4ef6\u4fee\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e0d\u9002\u5f53\u7684\u524d\u666f\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u7a7a\u95f4\u5408\u7406\u6027\u7684\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u4f7f\u5176\u96be\u4ee5\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u5956\u52b1\u7684RLHF\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86InpaintDPO\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) MaskDPO\u5c06\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u9650\u5236\u5728\u80cc\u666f\u533a\u57df\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u524d\u666f\u533a\u57df\u4fdd\u7559\u4fee\u590d\u635f\u5931\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u524d\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b2) \u6761\u4ef6\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u901a\u8fc7\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u88c1\u526a\u64cd\u4f5c\u91c7\u6837\u6837\u672c\u5bf9\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u8fb9\u754c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b3) \u5171\u4eab\u5171\u6027\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u80dc\u51fa\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u7684\u5171\u540c\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7a7a\u95f4\u5171\u6027\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u524d\u666f\u6761\u4ef6\u4fee\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u524d\u666f\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u53d1\u751f\u3002", "conclusion": "InpaintDPO\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u524d\u666f\u6761\u4ef6\u4fee\u590d\u4e2d\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u8bc4\u4f30\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5408\u7406\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, we observe that when only a limited number of crops per image are used, soft labels are prone to local semantic drift: a crop may visually resemble another class, causing its soft embedding to deviate from the ground-truth semantics of the original image. This mismatch between local visual content and global semantic meaning introduces systematic errors and distribution misalignment between training and testing. In this work, we revisit the overlooked role of hard labels and show that, when appropriately integrated, they provide a powerful content-agnostic anchor to calibrate semantic drift. We theoretically characterize the emergence of drift under few soft-label supervision and demonstrate that hybridizing soft and hard labels restores alignment between visual content and semantic supervision. Building on this insight, we propose a new training paradigm, Hard Label for Alleviating Local Semantic Drift (HALD), which leverages hard labels as intermediate corrective signals while retaining the fine-grained advantages of soft labels. Extensive experiments on dataset distillation and large-scale conventional classification benchmarks validate our approach, showing consistent improvements in generalization. On ImageNet-1K, we achieve 42.7% with only 285M storage for soft labels, outperforming prior state-of-the-art LPLD by 9.0%.

Despite their potential, existing methods often rely on ID-based representations that obscure semantic meaning and impose structural constraints on language models, thereby limiting their applicability in open-ended scenarios. These challenges are intensified by the complex nature of real-world interactions, where diverse user intents are entangled and collaborative signals rarely align with linguistic semantics. To overcome these limitations, we propose BEAT, a unified and transferable framework that tokenizes user and item behaviors into discrete, interpretable sequences. We construct a behavior vocabulary via a vector-quantized autoencoding process that disentangles macro-level interests and micro-level intentions from graph-based representations. We then introduce multi-level semantic supervision to bridge the gap between behavioral signals and language space. A semantic alignment regularization mechanism is designed to embed behavior tokens directly into the input space of frozen language models. Experiments on three public datasets show that BEAT improves zero-shot recommendation performance while generating coherent and informative explanations. Further analysis demonstrates that our behavior tokens capture fine-grained semantics and offer a plug-and-play interface for integrating complex behavior patterns into large language models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The approach, termed SICAMS (Statistical Identification and Classification of Anomalies in Mahalanobis Space), processes heterogeneous pressure and flow sensor data through a whitening transformation to eliminate spatial correlations among measurements. Based on the transformed data, the Hotelling's $T^2$ statistic is constructed, enabling the formulation of anomaly detection as a statistical hypothesis test of network conformity to normal operating conditions. It is shown that Hotelling's $T^2$ statistic can serve as an integral indicator of the overall \"health\" of the system, exhibiting correlation with total leakage volume, and thereby enabling approximate estimation of water losses via a regression model. A heuristic algorithm is developed to analyze the $T^2$ time series and classify detected anomalies into abrupt leaks, incipient leaks, and sensor malfunctions. Furthermore, a coarse leak localization method is proposed, which ranks sensors according to their statistical contribution and employs Laplacian interpolation to approximate the affected region within the network. Application of the proposed framework to the BattLeDIM L-Town benchmark dataset demonstrates high sensitivity and reliability in leak detection, maintaining robust performance even under multiple leaks.

Most state-of-the-art approaches rely on late fusion to combine visual and audio features, but late fusion often fails to capture fine-grained cross-modal interactions, which can be critical for robust performance in unconstrained scenarios. In this paper, we introduce GateFusion, a novel architecture that combines strong pretrained unimodal encoders with a Hierarchical Gated Fusion Decoder (HiGate). HiGate enables progressive, multi-depth fusion by adaptively injecting contextual features from one modality into the other at multiple layers of the Transformer backbone, guided by learnable, bimodally-conditioned gates. To further strengthen multimodal learning, we propose two auxiliary objectives: Masked Alignment Loss (MAL) to align unimodal outputs with multimodal predictions, and Over-Positive Penalty (OPP) to suppress spurious video-only activations. GateFusion establishes new state-of-the-art results on several challenging ASD benchmarks, achieving 77.8% mAP (+9.4%), 86.1% mAP (+2.9%), and 96.1% mAP (+0.5%) on Ego4D-ASD, UniTalk, and WASD benchmarks, respectively, and delivering competitive performance on AVA-ActiveSpeaker.

They take as input a single RGB image and output a deep feature representation that is useful for various applications. However, in case we have multiple views of the same 3D scene, they operate on each image independently and do not always produce consistent features for the same 3D point. We propose a way to convert a Foundation Model into a Multi-View Foundation Model. Such a model takes as input a set of images and outputs a feature map for each image such that the features of corresponding points are as consistent as possible. This approach bypasses the need to build a consistent 3D model of the features and allows direct manipulation in the image space. Specifically, we show how to augment Transformers-based foundation models (i.e., DINO, SAM, CLIP) with intermediate 3D-aware attention layers that help match features across different views. As leading examples, we show surface normal estimation and multi-view segmentation tasks. Quantitative experiments show that our method improves feature matching considerably compared to current foundation models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5355\u89c6\u89d2\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u51653D\u611f\u77e5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u7279\u5f81\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u7279\u5f81\u5339\u914d\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u540c\u4e003D\u573a\u666f\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\uff0c\u4e3a\u540c\u4e003D\u70b9\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u5728Transformer\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982DINO\u3001SAM\u3001CLIP\uff09\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4e2d\u95f43D\u611f\u77e5\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u591a\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u5bf9\u5e94\u70b9\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5c3d\u53ef\u80fd\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6784\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u76843D\u7279\u5f81\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9a\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7279\u5f81\u5339\u914d\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5728\u8868\u9762\u6cd5\u7ebf\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u5272\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u5355\u89c6\u89d2\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301\u8de8\u89c6\u89d2\u7279\u5f81\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In oncology, this is further exacerbated by the fact that experimental data are often sparse and sometimes are composed of a few time points of tumor volume. In this paper, we propose to learn time-varying interactions between cells, such as those of bladder cancer tumors and immune cells, and their response to a combination of anticancer treatments in a limited data scenario. We employ the physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach to predict possible subpopulation trajectories at time points where no observed data are available. We demonstrate that our approach is consistent with the biological explanation of subpopulation trajectories. Our method provides a framework for learning evolving interactions among biological organisms when external interventions are applied to their environment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, due to the capability limitations of the base diffusion language model, the performance of the diffusion vision language model (dVLM) still lags significantly behind that of mainstream models. This leads to a simple yet fundamental question: Is it possible to construct dVLMs based on existing powerful AR models? In response, we propose DiffusionVL, a dVLM family that could be translated from any powerful AR models. Through simple fine-tuning, we successfully adapt AR pre-trained models into the diffusion paradigm. This approach yields two key observations: (1) The paradigm shift from AR-based multimodal models to diffusion is remarkably effective. (2) Direct conversion of an AR language model to a dVLM is also feasible, achieving performance competitive with LLaVA-style visual-instruction-tuning. Further, we introduce a block-decoding design into dVLMs that supports arbitrary-length generation and KV cache reuse, achieving a significant inference speedup. We conduct a large number of experiments. Despite training with less than 5% of the data required by prior methods, DiffusionVL achieves a comprehensive performance improvement-a 34.4% gain on the MMMU-Pro (vision) bench and 37.5% gain on the MME (Cog.) bench-alongside a 2x inference speedup. The model and code are released at https://github.com/hustvl/DiffusionVL.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
