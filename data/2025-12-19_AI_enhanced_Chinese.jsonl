The system composes optical layouts by arranging components from a three-tier toolbox via semantic retrieval, then validates designs through physics simulation with convergent refinement. The architecture combines intent routing, knowledge-augmented generation, and dual-mode validation (QuTiP and FreeSim). We evaluated 13 experiments spanning fundamental optics (Hong-Ou-Mandel interference, Michelson/Mach-Zehnder interferometry, Bell states, delayed-choice quantum eraser), quantum information protocols (BB84 QKD, Franson interferometry, GHZ states, quantum teleportation, hyperentanglement), and advanced technologies (boson sampling, electromagnetically induced transparency, frequency conversion). The system achieves design-simulation alignment scores of 8--9/10, with simulations faithfully modeling intended physics. A critical finding distinguishes structural correctness from quantitative accuracy: high alignment confirms correct physics architecture, while numerical predictions require expert review. Free-form simulation outperformed constrained frameworks for 11/13 experiments, revealing that quantum optics diversity demands flexible mathematical representations. The system democratizes computational experiment design for research and pedagogy, producing strong initial designs users can iteratively refine through conversation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper introduces the Principle of Proportional Duty (PPD), a novel framework that models how ethical responsibility scales with an agent's epistemic state. The framework reveals that moral duty is not lost to uncertainty but transforms: as uncertainty increases, Action Duty (the duty to act decisively) is proportionally converted into Repair Duty (the active duty to verify, inquire, and resolve uncertainty).\n  This dynamic is expressed by the equation D_total = K[(1-HI) + HI * g(C_signal)], where Total Duty is a function of Knowledge (K), Humility/Uncertainty (HI), and Contextual Signal Strength (C_signal). Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that systems maintaining a baseline humility coefficient (lambda > 0) produce more stable duty allocations and reduce the risk of overconfident decision-making.\n  By formalizing humility as a system parameter, the PPD offers a mathematically tractable approach to moral responsibility that could inform the development of auditable AI decision systems. This paper applies the framework across four domains, clinical ethics, recipient-rights law, economic governance, and artificial intelligence, to demonstrate its cross-disciplinary validity. The findings suggest that proportional duty serves as a stabilizing principle within complex systems, preventing both overreach and omission by dynamically balancing epistemic confidence against contextual risk.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4f26\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u6bd4\u4f8b\u8d23\u4efb\u539f\u5219\uff08PPD\uff09\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9053\u5fb7\u8d23\u4efb\u91cf\u5316\u4e3a\u4e0e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8ba4\u77e5\u72b6\u6001\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4f26\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u89c6\u4e3a\u884c\u52a8\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u52a8\u6001\u91cf\u5316\u9053\u5fb7\u8d23\u4efb\u968f\u8ba4\u77e5\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5efa\u7acb\u80fd\u591f\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u63cf\u8ff0\u8d23\u4efb\u5982\u4f55\u968f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6bd4\u4f8b\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6bd4\u4f8b\u8d23\u4efb\u539f\u5219\uff08PPD\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u6570\u5b66\u65b9\u7a0b D_total = K[(1-HI) + HI * g(C_signal)] \u8868\u793a\u603b\u8d23\u4efb\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5305\u542b\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027/\u8c26\u900a\u7cfb\u6570\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6a21\u62df\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u4f26\u7406\u3001\u63a5\u6536\u8005\u6743\u5229\u6cd5\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6cbb\u7406\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u56db\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u5e94\u7528\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u62df\u663e\u793a\u4fdd\u6301\u57fa\u51c6\u8c26\u900a\u7cfb\u6570\uff08\u03bb>0\uff09\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8d23\u4efb\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u51b3\u7b56\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u5e94\u7528\u9886\u57df\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6bd4\u4f8b\u8d23\u4efb\u539f\u5219\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8c26\u900a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4e3a\u9053\u5fb7\u8d23\u4efb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u4e0a\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u8ba4\u77e5\u4fe1\u5fc3\u4e0e\u60c5\u5883\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u5ea6\u6216\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

Unlike unconstrained text-to-3D approaches, our method operates within a discrete parts vocabulary, enforcing geometric validity, connection constraints, and buildability ordering. Using LDraw as a text-rich intermediate representation, we demonstrate that large language models can be guided with tools to produce valid step-by-step construction sequences and assembly instructions for brick-based prototypes of more than 3000 assembly parts. We introduce a Python library for programmatic model generation and evaluate buildable outputs on complex satellites, aircraft, and architectural domains. The approach aims for demonstrable scalability, modularity, and fidelity that bridges the gap between semantic design intent and manufacturable output. Physical prototyping follows from natural language specifications. The work proposes a novel elemental lingua franca as a key missing piece from the previous pixel-based diffusion methods or computer-aided design (CAD) models that fail to support complex assembly instructions or component exchange. Across four original designs, this novel \"bag of bricks\" method thus functions as a physical API: a constrained vocabulary connecting precisely oriented brick locations to a \"bag of words\" through which arbitrary functional requirements compile into material reality. Given such a consistent and repeatable AI representation opens new design options while guiding natural language implementations in manufacturing and engineering prototyping.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Trained on synthetically generated stable SISO plants with fixed-order Youla parameters, the proposed approach reliably synthesizes controllers that meet prescribed sensitivity and settling-time specifications on previously unseen systems.

The approach mirrors the way in which epidemiologists enable public health interventions through statistical evidence before molecular mechanisms are understood. This bypasses the problem of model complexity which plagues current interpretability methods (such as SHAP and mechanistic interpretability) at the scale of deployed models.\n  AI Epidemiology achieves this population-level surveillance by standardising capture of AI-expert interactions into structured assessment fields: risk level, alignment score, and accuracy score. These function as exposure variables which predict output failure through statistical associations, much like cholesterol and blood pressure act as exposure variables predicting cardiac events. Output-failure associations are subsequently validated against expert overrides and real-world outcomes.\n  The framework places zero burden on experts and provides automatic audit trails by passively tracking expert convergence and divergence with AI recommendations. Since it analyses outputs rather than internal model computations, it also provides governance continuity when institutions update models and switch vendors. Finally, by providing reliability scores and semantic assessments (e.g. 'this recommendation resembles 500 cases overridden by experts due to guideline violations'), it enables experts and institutions to detect unreliable AI outputs before they cause harm. This democratises AI oversight by enabling domain experts to govern AI systems without requiring machine learning expertise.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This limitation can be attributed to the fact that MLLMs learn visual understanding primarily from textual descriptions, which constitute a subjective and inherently incomplete supervisory signal. Furthermore, the modest scale of multimodal instruction tuning compared to massive text-only pre-training leads MLLMs to overfit language priors while overlooking visual details. To address these issues, we introduce JARVIS, a JEPA-inspired framework for self-supervised visual enhancement in MLLMs. Specifically, we integrate the I-JEPA learning paradigm into the standard vision-language alignment pipeline of MLLMs training. Our approach leverages frozen vision foundation models as context and target encoders, while training the predictor, implemented as the early layers of an LLM, to learn structural and semantic regularities from images without relying exclusively on language supervision. Extensive experiments on standard MLLM benchmarks show that JARVIS consistently improves performance on vision-centric benchmarks across different LLM families, without degrading multimodal reasoning abilities.

However, current model-centric agent architectures struggle to self-evolve post-deployment: improving personalization, capability, and efficiency typically requires continuous model retraining/fine-tuning, which incurs prohibitive computational overheads and suffers from an inherent trade-off between model accuracy and inference efficiency.\n  To enable iterative self-evolution without model retraining, we propose MOBIMEM, a memory-centric agent system. MOBIMEM first introduces three specialized memory primitives to decouple agent evolution from model weights: (1) Profile Memory uses a lightweight distance-graph (DisGraph) structure to align with user preferences, resolving the accuracy-latency trade-off in user profile retrieval; (2) Experience Memory employs multi-level templates to instantiate execution logic for new tasks, ensuring capability generalization; and (3) Action Memory records fine-grained interaction sequences, reducing the reliance on expensive model inference. Building upon this memory architecture, MOBIMEM further integrates a suite of OS-inspired services to orchestrate execution: a scheduler that coordinates parallel sub-task execution and memory operations; an agent record-and-replay (AgentRR) mechanism that enables safe and efficient action reuse; and a context-aware exception handling that ensures graceful recovery from user interruptions and runtime errors.\n  Evaluation on AndroidWorld and top-50 apps shows that MOBIMEM achieves 83.1% profile alignment with 23.83 ms retrieval time (280x faster than GraphRAG baselines), improves task success rates by up to 50.3%, and reduces end-to-end latency by up to 9x on mobile devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The growing number of similar in functionality models raises the challenge of evaluating them on datasets that do not contain ground truth annotations. We introduce a practical framework to assist in this task. Approach We harmonize the segmentation results into a standard, interoperable representation, which enables consistent, terminology-based labeling of the structures. We extend 3D Slicer to streamline loading and comparison of these harmonized segmentations, and demonstrate how standard representation simplifies review of the results using interactive summary plots and browser-based visualization using OHIF Viewer. To demonstrate the utility of the approach we apply it to evaluating segmentation of 31 anatomical structures (lungs, vertebrae, ribs, and heart) by six open-source models - TotalSegmentator 1.5 and 2.6, Auto3DSeg, MOOSE, MultiTalent, and CADS - for a sample of Computed Tomography (CT) scans from the publicly available National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) dataset. Results We demonstrate the utility of the framework in enabling automating loading, structure-wise inspection and comparison across models. Preliminary results ascertain practical utility of the approach in allowing quick detection and review of problematic results.

However, current evaluation benchmarks remain predominantly language-centric or heavily reliant on simulated environments, rarely probing the nuanced, knowledge-intensive reasoning essential for practical, real-world scenarios. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce the task of Sparsely Grounded Visual Navigation, explicitly designed to evaluate the sequential decision-making abilities of MLLMs in challenging, knowledge-intensive real-world environments. We operationalize this task with CityNav, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing four diverse global cities, specifically constructed to assess raw MLLM-driven agents in city navigation. Agents are required to rely solely on visual inputs and internal multimodal reasoning to sequentially navigate 50+ decision points without additional environmental annotations or specialized architectural modifications. Crucially, agents must autonomously achieve localization through interpreting city-specific cues and recognizing landmarks, perform spatial reasoning, and strategically plan and execute routes to their destinations. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that current state-of-the-art MLLMs and standard reasoning techniques (e.g., Chain-of-Thought, Reflection) significantly underperform in this challenging setting. To address this, we propose Verbalization of Path (VoP), which explicitly grounds the agent's internal reasoning by probing an explicit cognitive map (key landmarks and directions toward the destination) from the MLLMs, substantially enhancing navigation success.

An ocean-specific DoF-channel coupling model is established, explicitly deriving conditions for spatial rank enhancement. Subsequently, the optimal geometric locus, termed the Light-Point, is analytically identified, where deploying a single aRIS maximizes DoFs by introducing two and three additional resolvable paths in deep-sea and shallow-sea environments, respectively.

However, its widespread clinical adoption is hindered by significant challenges, such as radiation exposure, limited availability, high clinical workload, and substantial financial costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose Multi-scale CBAM Residual Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network (MCR-VQGAN) to synthesize high-fidelity tau PET images from structural T1-weighted MRI scans. MCR-VQGAN improves standard VQGAN by integrating three key architectural enhancements: multi-scale convolutions, ResNet blocks, and Convolutional Block Attention Modules (CBAM). Using 222 paired structural T1-weighted MRI and tau PET scans from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we trained and compared MCR-VQGAN with cGAN, WGAN-GP, CycleGAN, and VQGAN. Our proposed model achieved superior image synthesis performance across all metrics: MSE of 0.0056 +/- 0.0061, PSNR of 24.39 +/- 4.49 dB, and SSIM of 0.9000 +/- 0.0453. To assess the clinical utility of the synthetic images, we trained and evaluated a CNN-based AD classifier. The classifier achieved comparable accuracy when tested on real (63.64%) and synthetic (65.91%) images. This result indicates that our synthesis process successfully preserves diagnostically relevant features without significant information loss. Our results demonstrate that MCR-VQGAN can offer a reliable and scalable surrogate for conventional tau PET imaging, potentially improving the accessibility and scalability of tau imaging biomarkers for AD research and clinical workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, recent studies highlight the importance of high-frequency signals. The role of low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals in recommendation remains unclear. This paper aims to bridge this gap by investigating the influence of graph signals on recommendation performance. We theoretically prove that the effects of low-frequency and high-frequency graph signals are equivalent in recommendation tasks, as both contribute by smoothing the similarities between user-item pairs. To leverage this insight, we propose a frequency signal scaler, a plug-and-play module that adjusts the graph signal filter function to fine-tune the smoothness between user-item pairs, making it compatible with any GNN model. Additionally, we identify and prove that graph embedding-based methods cannot fully capture the characteristics of graph signals. To address this limitation, a space flip method is introduced to restore the expressive power of graph embeddings. Remarkably, we demonstrate that either low-frequency or high-frequency graph signals alone are sufficient for effective recommendations.

Inspired by this capability, we introduce R4, a training-free framework for retrieval-augmented reasoning in 4D spatio-temporal space that equips vision-language models (VLMs) with structured, lifelong memory. R4 continuously constructs a 4D knowledge database by anchoring object-level semantic descriptions in metric space and time, yielding a persistent world model that can be shared across agents. At inference, natural language queries are decomposed into semantic, spatial, and temporal keys to retrieve relevant observations, which are integrated into the VLM's reasoning. Unlike classical retrieval-augmented generation methods, retrieval in R4 operates directly in 4D space, enabling episodic and collaborative reasoning without training.

While transformers have shown promise in various control applications due to sequential modeling through self-attention mechanisms, they have not been used within adaptive control architectures that provide stability guarantees. Existing transformer-based approaches for control rely on offline training with fixed weights, resulting in open-loop implementations that lack real-time adaptation capabilities and stability assurances. To address these limitations, a continuous LyAT controller is developed that adaptively estimates drift and diffusion uncertainties in stochastic dynamical systems without requiring offline pre-training. A key innovation is the analytically derived adaptation law constructed from a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, which enables real-time weight updates while guaranteeing probabilistic uniform ultimate boundedness of tracking and parameter estimation errors. Experimental validation on a quadrotor demonstrates the performance of the developed controller.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLyapunov\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94Transformer\uff08LyAT\uff09\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6743\u91cd\u56fa\u5b9a\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u6269\u6563\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u786e\u4fdd\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u8fde\u7eedLyAT\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u79bb\u7ebf\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f30\u8ba1\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6f02\u79fb\u548c\u6269\u6563\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\u662f\u57fa\u4e8eLyapunov\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u6784\u5efa\u89e3\u6790\u63a8\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5f8b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u65cb\u7ffc\u98de\u884c\u5668\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4e00\u81f4\u6700\u7ec8\u6709\u754c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LyAT\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u6210\u529f\u5c06Transformer\u878d\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a7\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Conventional countermeasures such as fixed power control or static channel hopping are largely ineffective against such adaptive adversaries. This paper presents a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework based on the QMIX algorithm to improve the resilience of swarm communications under reactive jamming. We consider a network of multiple transmitter-receiver pairs sharing channels while a reactive jammer with Markovian threshold dynamics senses aggregate power and reacts accordingly. Each agent jointly selects transmit frequency (channel) and power, and QMIX learns a centralized but factorizable action-value function that enables coordinated yet decentralized execution. We benchmark QMIX against a genie-aided optimal policy in a no-channel-reuse setting, and against local Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and a stateless reactive policy in a more general fading regime with channel reuse enabled. Simulation results show that QMIX rapidly converges to cooperative policies that nearly match the genie-aided bound, while achieving higher throughput and lower jamming incidence than the baselines, thereby demonstrating MARL's effectiveness for securing autonomous swarms in contested environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We visualize information patterns in chaotic and non-chaotic systems for both single trajectories and multiple initial conditions, demonstrating how information-based analysis can improve sampling efficiency and enhance model performance by prioritizing more informative data. The benefits of statistical bagging are further elucidated through spectral analysis of the FIM. We also illustrate how Fisher information and entropy metrics can promote data efficiency in three scenarios: when only a single trajectory is available, when a tunable control parameter exists, and when multiple trajectories can be freely initialized. As data-driven model discovery continues to gain prominence, principled sampling strategies guided by quantifiable information metrics offer a powerful approach for improving learning efficiency and reducing data requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

PediatricAnxietyBench is an open-source benchmark of 300 high-quality queries across 10 pediatric topics (150 patient-derived, 150 adversarial) enabling reproducible evaluation. Two Llama models (70B and 8B) were assessed using a multi-dimensional safety framework covering diagnostic restraint, referral adherence, hedging, and emergency recognition. Adversarial queries incorporated parental pressure patterns, including urgency, economic barriers, and challenges to disclaimers. Mean safety score was 5.50/15 (SD=2.41). The 70B model outperformed the 8B model (6.26 vs 4.95, p<0.001) with lower critical failures (4.8% vs 12.0%, p=0.02). Adversarial queries reduced safety by 8% (p=0.03), with urgency causing the largest drop (-1.40). Vulnerabilities appeared in seizures (33.3% inappropriate diagnosis) and post-vaccination queries. Hedging strongly correlated with safety (r=0.68, p<0.001), while emergency recognition was absent.

In practice, most model families scale language component while reusing nearly identical vision encoders (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL 3B/7B/72B), which raises pivotal concerns about whether progress reflects genuine visual grounding or reliance on internet-scale textual world knowledge. Existing evaluation methods emphasize end-task accuracy, overlooking robustness, attribution fidelity, and reasoning under controlled perturbations. We present The Perceptual Observatory, a framework that characterizes MLLMs across verticals like: (i) simple vision tasks, such as face matching and text-in-vision comprehension capabilities; (ii) local-to-global understanding, encompassing image matching, grid pointing game, and attribute localization, which tests general visual grounding. Each vertical is instantiated with ground-truth datasets of faces and words, systematically perturbed through pixel-based augmentations and diffusion-based stylized illusions.

Each user holds a private input, and the goal is for each user to compute the sum of all inputs without revealing any additional information, even in the presence of collusion among up to $T$ users. Traditional DSA typically requires large key sizes to protect all information except for the input sum and the information of colluding users. To mitigate the source keys overhead, we study decentralized secure aggregation with arbitrary collusion and heterogeneous security constraints. In this setting, the inputs of a predefined collection of user subsets, called the \\emph{security set} $\\bm{\\mathcal{S}}$, must be protected from another predefined collection, the \\emph{collusion set} $\\bm{\\mathcal{T}}$. For an arbitrary security set $\\mathcal{S}\\in \\bm{\\mathcal{S}}$ and an arbitrary collusion set $\\mathcal{T}\\in \\bm{\\mathcal{T}}$, we characterize the optimal communication and source key rates. A key contribution of this work is the characterization of the optimal source key rate, i.e., the minimum number of key bits per input bit that must be shared among users for decentralized secure aggregation with arbitrary collusion and heterogeneous security constraints to be feasible.

Darth Vecdor (DV) was designed to extract this knowledge into a structured, terminology-mapped, SQL database (\"knowledge base\" or \"knowledge graph\"). Knowledge graphs may be useful in many domains, including healthcare. Although one might query an LLM directly rather than a SQL-based knowledge graph, concerns such as cost, speed, safety, and confidence may arise, especially in high-volume operations. These may be mitigated when the information is pre-extracted from the LLM and becomes query-able through a standard database. However, the author found the need to address several issues. These included erroneous, off-topic, free-text, overly general, and inconsistent LLM responses, as well as allowing for multi-element responses. DV was built with features intended to mitigate these issues. To facilitate ease of use, and to allow for prompt engineering by those with domain expertise but little technical background, DV provides a simple, browser-based graphical user interface. DV has been released as free, open-source, extensible software, on an \"as is\" basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind, either express or implied. Users need to be cognizant of the potential risks and benefits of using DV and its outputs, and users are responsible for ensuring any use is safe and effective.

This work introduces Janus, a unified generative-predictive framework to address this problem.

Janus is first validated on the MNIST dataset, demonstrating high-fidelity reconstruction, accurate classification and diverse generative inversion of all ten target classes. It is then applied to the inverse design of heterogeneous microstructures labeled with thermal conductivity. It achieves a forward prediction accuracy $R^2=0.98$ (2\\% relative error) and sub-5\\% pixelwise reconstruction error. Inverse solutions satisfy target properties to within $1\\%$ relative error. Inverting a sweep through properties reveal smooth traversal of the latent manifold, and UMAP visualization confirms the emergence of a low-dimensional, disentangled manifold.

The OMAS is interpreted into a perturbed $M^3D$ system in which unstable subsystems are created when repelling interactions dominate the normal cooperative ones in the OMAS network regardless of its connectivity. To handle the destabilizing effects brought by the repelling interaction as well as the non-vanishing perturbations, we extend the stability theory for $M^3D$ systems and apply it to the OMAS to show that practical consensus tracking can be achieved if the migration-induced switching satisfies the piecewise average dwell time and activation time ratio constraints.

Most of the standard RAG frameworks regard all retrieved information as equally reliable, overlooking the varying credibility and interconnected nature of large textual corpora. GraphRAG approaches offer potential improvement to RAG systems by integrating knowledge graphs, which structure information into nodes and edges, capture entity relationships, and enable multi-step logical traversal. However, GraphRAG is not always an ideal solution as it depends on high-quality graph representations of the corpus, which requires either pre-existing knowledge graphs that are expensive to build and update, or automated graph construction pipelines that are often unreliable. Moreover, systems following this paradigm typically use large language models to guide graph traversal and evidence retrieval, leading to challenges similar to those encountered with standard RAG. In this paper, we propose a novel RAG framework that employs the spreading activation algorithm to retrieve information from a corpus of documents interconnected by automatically constructed knowledge graphs, thereby enhancing the performance of large language models on complex tasks such as multi-hop question answering. Experiments show that our method achieves better or comparable performance to iterative RAG methodologies, while also being easily integrable as a plug-and-play module with a wide range of RAG-based approaches.

Multimodal models such as CLIP have been able to perform well on this task by learning semantic similarities across vision and language; however, despite these advances, image classification is still a challenging task. Models with low capacity often suffer from underfitting and thus underperform on fine-grained image classification. Along with this, it is important to ensure high-quality data with rich cross-modal representations of each class, which is often difficult to generate. When datasets do not enforce balanced demographics, the predictions will be biased toward the more represented class, while others will be neglected. We focus on how these issues can lead to harmful bias for zero-shot image classification, and explore how to combat these issues in demographic bias.

Motivated by the recent success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in computer vision, we explore their potential for few-shot multispectral object detection. Specifically, we adapt two representative VLM-based detectors, Grounding DINO and YOLO-World, to handle multispectral inputs and propose an effective mechanism to integrate text, visual and thermal modalities. Through extensive experiments on two popular multispectral image benchmarks, FLIR and M3FD, we demonstrate that VLM-based detectors not only excel in few-shot regimes, significantly outperforming specialized multispectral models trained with comparable data, but also achieve competitive or superior results under fully supervised settings.

The PEMFC is installed within the hydrogen industry to facilitate direct access to hydrogen fuel. Based on the microgrid topology and black-start scheme, this study innovatively sizes the rated capacity of the PEMFC through power flow analysis. The capacity must be sufficient to charge passive components such as transmission lines and transformers, provide rotor excitation, and supply wind turbine (WT) and electrolyzer (ELZ) auxiliaries during startup. The proposed system integrates wind-hydrogen coordinated control (WHCC) and hydrogen-storage coordinated control (HSCC). Under maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of the WTs, the ELZ follows power fluctuations to absorb wind output, ensuring stable voltage and frequency. Fixed-frequency control applied to either the DFIG or PEMFC converters enables DFIGs to retain conventional grid-following (GFL) operation, reducing converter development costs. For both control modes, this paper establishes the black-start sequence and formulates a comprehensive coordinated control strategy for the entire system. The entire control system is validated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink. Results confirm that the calculated PEMFC capacity supports reliable black-start, while the black-start control strategy ensures smooth system self-startup. Furthermore, the coordinated control strategy maintains stable frequency and voltage under fluctuating wind power, demonstrating the practicality and robustness of the proposed approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Despite extensive theoretical development and applications across diverse fields, the search for a unique, universally accepted solution remains elusive, with numerous competing proposals offering different decompositions. A promising but underutilized strategy for making progress is to establish inconsistency results, proofs that certain combinations of intuitively appealing axioms cannot be simultaneously satisfied. Such results clarify the landscape of possibilities and force us to recognize where fundamental choices must be made. In this work, we leverage the recently developed mereological approach to PID to establish novel inconsistency results with far-reaching implications. Our main theorem demonstrates that three cornerstone properties of classical information theory, namely non-negativity, the chain rule, and invariance under invertible transformations, become mutually incompatible when extended to the PID setting. This result reveals that any PID framework must sacrifice at least one property that seems fundamental to information theory itself.

In this work, we investigate the feasibility of replacing LLM-driven workflows with optimized SLMs. We trained a domain-adapted SLM to execute representative tasks traditionally handled by LLMs, such as document summarization, query answering, and structured data interpretation. As part of the experiment, we investigated the fine-tuning of facebook/opt-350m model (single epoch only) using the Hugging Face TRL (Transformer Reinforcement Learning), specifically the Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) trainer. The OPT-350M model was released by Meta AI in 2022 as part of the OPT (Open Pretrained Transformer) family of models. Similar studies demonstrate that even models at the 350M parameter scale can meaningfully contribute to instruction-tuning pipelines (Mekala et al., 2024). Experimental results demonstrated that our fine-tuned SLM achieves exceptional performance with a 77.55\\% pass rate on ToolBench evaluation, significantly outperforming all baseline models including ChatGPT-CoT (26.00\\%), ToolLLaMA-DFS (30.18\\%), and ToolLLaMA-CoT (16.27\\%).

Training a machine-learned model for VSR typically requires vast amounts of annotated images. Yet, species-level annotation demands domain expertise, making it realistic for domain experts to annotate only a few examples. These limited labeled data motivate training an ''expert'' model via few-shot learning (FSL). Meanwhile, advanced Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated prominent performance on general recognition tasks. It is straightforward to ask whether LMMs excel in the highly specialized VSR task and whether they outshine FSL expert models. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that LMMs struggle in this task, despite using various established prompting techniques. LMMs even significantly underperform FSL expert models, which are as simple as finetuning a pretrained visual encoder on the few-shot images. However, our in-depth analysis reveals that LMMs can effectively post-hoc correct the expert models' incorrect predictions. Briefly, given a test image, when prompted with the top predictions from an FSL expert model, LMMs can recover the ground-truth label. Building on this insight, we derive a simple method called Post-hoc Correction (POC), which prompts an LMM to re-rank the expert model's top predictions using enriched prompts that include softmax confidence scores and few-shot visual examples. Across five challenging VSR benchmarks, POC outperforms prior art of FSL by +6.4% in accuracy without extra training, validation, or manual intervention.

We benchmark a diverse set of open-source and closed-source VLMs on 27 agricultural classification datasets from the AgML collection, spanning 162 classes across plant disease, pest and damage, and plant and weed species identification. Across all tasks, zero-shot VLMs substantially underperform a supervised task-specific baseline (YOLO11), which consistently achieves markedly higher accuracy than any foundation model. Under multiple-choice prompting, the best-performing VLM (Gemini-3 Pro) reaches approximately 62% average accuracy, while open-ended prompting yields much lower performance, with raw accuracies typically below 25%. Applying LLM-based semantic judging increases open-ended accuracy (for example, from 21% to 30% for top models) and alters model rankings, demonstrating that evaluation methodology meaningfully affects reported conclusions. Among open-source models, Qwen-VL-72B performs best, approaching closed-source performance under constrained prompting but still trailing top proprietary systems. Task-level analysis shows that plant and weed species classification is consistently easier than pest and damage identification, which remains the most challenging category across models.

While block error rate (BLER) is a common metric, it does not distinguish between confusions and erasures, which can have significantly different impacts in cross-layer protocol design, despite upper-layer protocols universally assuming physical (PHY) errors manifest as packet erasures rather than undetected corruptions - an assumption lacking rigorous PHY-layer validation. We present a systematic analysis of confusions and erasures under BLER-constrained maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. Through sphere-packing analysis, we provide analytical bounds for both block confusion and erasure probabilities, and derive the sensitivities of these bounds to blocklength and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on this topic in the FBL regime. Our findings provide theoretical validation for the block erasure channel abstraction commonly assumed in medium access control (MAC) and network layer protocols, confirming that, for practical FBL codes, block confusions are negligible compared to block erasures, especially at large blocklengths and high SNR.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

These estimates drive a selective mowing algorithm that dynamically alternates between mowing and conservation behavior.

In theoretical analysis, the goal is to investigate cellular communication mechanisms and develop nanomachine-assisted therapies to combat diseases. Since cells transmit information by releasing molecules at varying intensities, this process is commonly modeled using Poisson channels. In our study, we consider a discrete-time Poisson channel (DTPC). MC is often event-driven, making traditional Shannon communication an unsuitable performance metric. Instead, we adopt the identification framework introduced by Ahlswede and Dueck. In this approach, the receiver is only concerned with detecting whether a specific message of interest has been transmitted. Unlike Shannon transmission codes, the size of identification (ID) codes for a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) increases doubly exponentially with blocklength when using randomized encoding. This remarkable property makes the ID paradigm significantly more efficient than classical Shannon transmission in terms of energy consumption and hardware requirements. Another critical aspect of MC, influenced by the concept of the Internet of Bio-NanoThings, is security. In-body communication must be protected against potential eavesdroppers. To address this, we first analyze the DTPC for randomized identification (RI) and then extend our study to secure randomized identification (SRI). We derive capacity formulas for both RI and SRI, providing a comprehensive understanding of their performance and security implications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We address this gap by repositioning the LLM as an intelligent judge that evaluates, explains, and strategically coordinates an ensemble of foundation models. To overcome the LLM's inherent lack of domain-specific knowledge on time series, we introduce an R1-style finetuning process, guided by SHAP-based faithfulness scores, which teaches the model to interpret ensemble weights as meaningful causal statements about temporal dynamics.

To address this limitation, we propose GLOW, a unified framework for AW performance prediction that combines the graph-structure modeling capabilities of GNNs with the reasoning power of LLMs. Specifically, we introduce a graph-oriented LLM, instruction-tuned on graph tasks, to extract topologically aware semantic features, which are fused with GNN-encoded structural representations. A contrastive alignment strategy further refines the latent space to distinguish high-quality AWs.

The space of generalized temperatures is the orbit under the adjoint action of $\\mathrm{U}$ of a positivity domain in the Cartan subalgebra $C_c\\subset\\mathbb{H}$ of the maximal compact subalgebra $\\mathbb{H}\\subset\\mathbb{U}$.

The most important property of the Gibbs probability distributions provided by the here introduced setup is their covariance with respect to the action of the full group of symmetries $\\mathrm{U}$.

Although some methods mitigate this limitation by simply classifying unknown traffic into a single \"Other\" category, they fail to make a fine-grained classification. In this paper, we propose a Two-stage Adaptive OOD classification Network (TAO-Net) that achieves accurate classification for both In-Distribution (ID) and OOD encrypted traffic. The method incorporates an innovative two-stage design: the first stage employs a hybrid OOD detection mechanism that integrates transformer-based inter-layer transformation smoothness and feature analysis to effectively distinguish between ID and OOD traffic, while the second stage leverages large language models with a novel semantic-enhanced prompt strategy to transform OOD traffic classification into a generation task, enabling flexible fine-grained classification without relying on predefined labels.

To address this challenge, we propose a closed-loop evaluation platform for end-to-end autonomous driving, which can generate adversarial interactions in real-world scenes. In our platform, the real-world image generator cooperates with an adversarial traffic policy to evaluate various end-to-end models trained on real-world data. The generator, based on flow matching, efficiently and stably generates real-world images according to the traffic environment information. The efficient adversarial surrounding vehicle policy is designed to model challenging interactions and create corner cases that current autonomous driving systems struggle to handle. Experimental results demonstrate that the platform can generate realistic driving images efficiently. Through evaluating the end-to-end models such as UniAD and VAD, we demonstrate that based on the adversarial policy, our platform evaluates the performance degradation of the tested model in corner cases.

However, message bits are generally assumed to follow a uniform distribution which must first be transformed to a non-uniform distribution by using a distribution matching algorithm. One such algorithm is enumerative sphere shaping (ESS). Compared to algorithms such as constant composition distribution matching (CCDM), ESS can utilize more channel input symbol sequences, allowing it to achieve a comparably low rate loss. However, the distribution of channel input symbols produced by ESS is fixed, restricting the utility of ESS to channels with Gaussian-like capacity-achieving input distributions. In this paper, we generalize ESS to produce arbitrary discrete channel input distributions, making it usable on most channels. Crucially, our generalization replaces fixed weights used internally by ESS with weights depending on the desired channel input distribution. We present numerical simulations using generalized ESS with probabilistic amplitude shaping (PAS) to transmit sequences of 256 symbols over a simplified model of an unamplified coherent optical link, a channel with a distinctly non-Gaussian capacity-achieving input distribution. In these simulations, we found that generalized ESS improves the maximum transmission rate by 0.0425 bit/symbol at a frame error rate below 10^{-4} compared to CCDM.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

They use GenAI to clarify concepts, solve complex problems, and, in some cases, complete assignments by copying and pasting model-generated contents. While GenAI has the potential to enhance learning experience, it also raises concerns around misinformation, hallucinated outputs, and its potential to undermine critical thinking and problem-solving skills. In response, many universities, colleges, departments, and instructors have begun to develop and adopt policies to guide responsible integration of GenAI into learning environments. However, these policies vary widely across institutions and contexts, and their evolving nature often leaves students uncertain about expectations and best practices. To address this challenge, the authors designed and implemented an automated system for discovering and categorizing AI-related policies found in course syllabi and institutional policy websites. The system combines unsupervised topic modeling techniques to identify key policy themes with large language models (LLMs) to classify the level of GenAI allowance and other requirements in policy texts. The developed application achieved a coherence score of 0.73 for topic discovery. In addition, GPT-4.0-based classification of policy categories achieved precision between 0.92 and 0.97, and recall between 0.85 and 0.97 across eight identified topics. By providing structured and interpretable policy information, this tool promotes the safe, equitable, and pedagogically aligned use of GenAI technologies in education.

Estimating FOD from single-shell low angular resolution dMRI (LAR-FOD) is limited by accuracy, whereas estimating FOD from multi-shell high angular resolution dMRI (HAR-FOD) requires a long scanning time, which limits its applicability. Diffusion models have shown promise in estimating HAR-FOD based on LAR-FOD. However, using diffusion models to efficiently generate HAR-FOD is challenging due to the large number of spherical harmonic (SH) coefficients in FOD. Here, we propose a 3D multi-channel patch diffusion model to predict HAR-FOD from LAR-FOD. We design the FOD-patch adapter by introducing the prior brain anatomy for more efficient patch-based learning.

The adjective economic stems from the use of financial cost due to electricity consumption in a time horizon, such is the loss function minimized at each sampling period. The energetic approach is rarely encountered. This article presents for the first time a comparison between the energetic optimization objective and the economic one. The comparison is made on a cooling plant using air-cooled water chillers and a cold storage system. Models developed have been integrated into Simscape, and non-convex mixed optimization methods used to achieve optimal control trajectories for both energetic and economic goals considered separately. The results over several scenarios, and in different seasons, support the consideration of the energetic approach despite the current prevalence of the economic one. The results are dependent on the electric season and the available tariffs. In particular, for the high electric season and considering a representative tariff, the results show that an increment of about 2.15% in energy consumption takes place when using the economic approach instead of the energetic one. On the other hand, a reduction in cost of 2.94% is achieved.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5bf9\u591a\u51b7\u673a\u51b7\u5374\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u80fd\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u867d\u7136\u7ecf\u6d4e\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea62.94%\u7684\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u7ea62.15%\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u7535\u529b\u5b63\u8282\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u51b7\u673a\u51b7\u5374\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5355\u5143\u8d1f\u8377\u548c\u5355\u5143\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u4e3b\u8981\u91c7\u7528\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u4ee5\u7535\u529b\u6d88\u8017\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6210\u672c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u800c\u80fd\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f88\u5c11\u88ab\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u80fd\u6548\u548c\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u91c7\u7528\u98ce\u51b7\u5f0f\u6c34\u51b7\u673a\u548c\u51b7\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u51b7\u5374\u5de5\u5382\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\uff0c\u5c06\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u96c6\u6210\u5230Simscape\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u51f8\u6df7\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u522b\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u91cf\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0d\u540c\u5b63\u8282\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u7535\u529b\u5b63\u8282\u548c\u53ef\u7528\u7535\u4ef7\u3002\u5728\u9ad8\u7535\u529b\u5b63\u8282\u548c\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7535\u4ef7\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7ecf\u6d4e\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u80fd\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u80fd\u91cf\u6d88\u8017\u589e\u52a0\u7ea62.15%\uff0c\u4f46\u540c\u65f6\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u7ea62.94%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5f53\u524d\u7ecf\u6d4e\u65b9\u6cd5\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\u5730\u4f4d\uff0c\u4f46\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u652f\u6301\u8003\u8651\u80fd\u91cf\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u80fd\u6548\u548c\u6210\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u9009\u62e9\u5e94\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u529b\u5b63\u8282\u548c\u7535\u4ef7\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

In this study, we propose a novel two-user downlink power-domain NOMA framework that integrates a Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)-aided Guessing Random Additive Noise Decoding (GRAND) with successive interference cancellation (SIC). Unlike conventional SIC methods, which are susceptible to error propagation when there is low power disparity between users, the proposed scheme leverages GRAND's noise-centric strategy to systematically rank and test candidate error patterns until the correct codeword is identified. In this architecture, CRC is utilized not only to detect errors but also to aid the decoding process, effectively eliminating the need for separate Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes and reducing overall system overhead. Furthermore, the strong user enhances its decoding performance by applying SIC that is reinforced by GRAND-based decoding of the weaker user's signals, thereby minimizing error propagation and increasing throughput. Comprehensive simulation results over both Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels, under varying power allocations and user distances, show that the CRC-aided GRAND-NOMA approach significantly improves the Bit Error Rate (BER) performance compared to state-of-the-art NOMA decoding techniques. These findings underscore the potential of integrating universal decoding methods like GRAND into interference-limited multiuser environments for robust future wireless networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Traditional deterministic, metaheuristic, and machine-learning-assisted methods search within fixed, human-defined configuration spaces, limiting their ability to discover fundamentally new design topologies. Here we introduce ReactorFold, a generative framework that reformulates fuel-assembly design as a sequence modeling problem for language models. Using Monte Carlo data, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), the model learns the latent structure of a pressurized-water-reactor assembly and generates candidate layouts in a single forward pass. Notably, the DPO-aligned model exhibits emergent design-space expansion: despite being trained exclusively on configurations with a fixed number of gadolinium burnable absorber (Gd) rods, it autonomously adjusts Gd inventory to satisfy strict power-peaking constraints. The model also discovers high-performing asymmetric configurations that challenge conventional symmetric loading heuristics, accessing design regimes inaccessible to conventional search methods and demonstrating that language models can internalize causal physical relationships and transcend human-imposed design constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Various multi-view support vector machine (MvSVM) approaches have been developed, demonstrating significant success. Moreover, these models face challenges in effectively capturing decision boundaries in high-dimensional spaces using the kernel trick. They are also prone to errors and struggle with view inconsistencies, which are common in multi-view datasets. In this work, we introduce the multiview twin restricted kernel machine (TMvRKM), a novel model that integrates the strengths of kernel machines with the multiview framework, addressing key computational and generalization challenges associated with traditional kernel-based approaches. Unlike traditional methods that rely on solving large quadratic programming problems (QPPs), the proposed TMvRKM efficiently determines an optimal separating hyperplane through a regularized least squares approach, enhancing both computational efficiency and classification performance. The primal objective of TMvRKM includes a coupling term designed to balance errors across multiple views effectively. By integrating early and late fusion strategies, TMvRKM leverages the collective information from all views during training while remaining flexible to variations specific to individual views. The proposed TMvRKM model is rigorously tested on UCI, KEEL, and AwA benchmark datasets.

The proposed method first linearly solves camera parameters using the sphere motion model of the collimator, followed by nonlinear optimization to refine these parameters with high precision.

To protect the output information, which is considered private data and may be at high risk of exposure, Laplace noise is added to the information exchange. The conditions for achieving mean square and almost sure consensus in observer-based MASs are established using the backstepping method and the convergence theory for nonnegative almost supermartingales. It is shown that the separation principle remains valid for the consensus problem of linear MASs with decaying Laplace noise. Furthermore, the convergence rate is provided. Then, a joint design framework is developed for state estimation gain, feedback control gain, and noise to ensure the preservation of \u03b5-differential privacy. The output information of each agent is shown to be protected at every time step. Finally, sufficient conditions are established for simultaneously achieving consensus and preserving differential privacy for linear MASs utilizing both full-order and reduced-order observers.

We prove SCFA achieves convergence rate O(1/sqrt(T) + rho) where rho represents constraint violation rate, establishing the first convergence theory for constraint-based federated learning. Our analysis shows constraints reduce effective data heterogeneity by 41% and improve privacy-utility tradeoffs through hypothesis space reduction by factor theta=0.37. Under (epsilon,delta)-differential privacy with epsilon=10, constraint regularization maintains utility within 3.7% of non-private baseline versus 12.1% degradation for standard federated learning, representing 2.7x improvement. We validate our framework on manufacturing predictive maintenance using Bosch production data with 1.18 million samples and 968 sensor features, constructing knowledge graphs encoding 3,000 constraints from ISA-95 and MASON ontologies. Experiments demonstrate 22% faster convergence, 41.3% model divergence reduction, and constraint violation thresholds where rho<0.05 maintains 90% optimal performance while rho>0.18 causes catastrophic failure. Our theoretical predictions match empirical observations with R^2>0.90 across convergence, privacy, and violation-performance relationships.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faSCFA\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u7ea6\u675f\u63d0\u5347\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u975eIID\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u6536\u655b\u7f13\u6162\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u66f4\u65b0\u7b56\u7565\u5ffd\u7565\u8bed\u4e49\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u7ed3\u5408\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u6539\u8fdb\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8bed\u4e49\u7ea6\u675f\u8054\u90a6\u805a\u5408(SCFA)\uff0c\u5c06\u9886\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6(\u5982\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u3001\u4ea7\u4e1a\u6807\u51c6\u7ea6\u675f)\u5d4c\u5165\u8054\u90a6\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u6536\u655b\u7406\u8bba\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u7ea6\u675f\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u7ea6\u675f\u53ef\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u6784\u6027\u964d\u4f4e41%\uff0c\u9690\u79c1-\u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\u6539\u55842.7\u500d\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u534722%\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u5316\u51cf\u5c1141.3%\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u8fbeR\u00b2>0.90\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u4e49\u7ea6\u675f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u9608\u503c\u5b58\u5728\u4e34\u754c\u70b9(\u03c1\u22480.18)\uff0c\u9700\u4e25\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Traditional methods for PDE solving are cumbersome, relying on manual setup and domain expertise. While Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINNs) introduced end-to-end neural network-based solutions, and frameworks like DeepXDE further enhanced automation, these approaches still depend on expert knowledge and lack full autonomy. In this work, we frame PDE solving as tool invocation via LLM-driven agents and introduce PDE-Agent, the first toolchain-augmented multi-agent collaboration framework, inheriting the reasoning capacity of LLMs and the controllability of external tools and enabling automated PDE solving from natural language descriptions. PDE-Agent leverages the strengths of multi-agent and multi-tool collaboration through two key innovations: (1) A Prog-Act framework with graph memory for multi-agent collaboration, which enables effective dynamic planning and error correction via dual-loop mechanisms (localized fixes and global revisions). (2) A Resource-Pool integrated with a tool-parameter separation mechanism for multi-tool collaboration. This centralizes the management of runtime artifacts and resolves inter-tool dependency gaps in existing frameworks. To validate and evaluate this new paradigm for PDE solving , we develop PDE-Bench, a multi-type PDE Benchmark for agent-based tool collaborative solving, and propose multi-level metrics for assessing tool coordination. Evaluations verify that PDE-Agent exhibits superior applicability and performance in complex multi-step, cross-step dependent tasks.

This paper introduces a novel camera calibration method using a designed collimator system. Our collimator system provides a reliable and controllable calibration environment for the camera. Exploiting the unique optical geometry property of our collimator system, we introduce an angle invariance constraint and further prove that the relative motion between the calibration target and camera conforms to a spherical motion model. This constraint reduces the original 6DOF relative motion between target and camera to a 3DOF pure rotation motion. Using spherical motion constraint, a closed-form linear solver for multiple images and a minimal solver for two images are proposed for camera calibration. Furthermore, we propose a single collimator image calibration algorithm based on the angle invariance constraint. This algorithm eliminates the requirement for camera motion, providing a novel solution for flexible and fast calibration.

Prevailing efforts to address this through enhancing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are trapped in a dilemma: template-based datasets are scalable but structurally rigid, while manual annotation is linguistically diverse but unscalable and, critically, computationally imprecise. We introduce SPRITE, a novel framework that overcomes this dilemma by leveraging simulators and large models to programmatically synthesize scalable, diverse, and high-quality spatial reasoning data. The core innovation of SPRITE is to reframe ground-truth generation as a code-generation task. We utilize LLMs to compile complex spatial questions into executable programs, which are then verified against high-precision scene meta-information extracted from simulators. This ensures our ground truth is both computationally precise and verifiable, while the generative power of LLMs provides vast linguistic diversity. Leveraging this pipeline, we have curated a dataset encompassing 3 simulators, 11k+ scenes, and 300k+ image/video instruction-tuning pairs. We demonstrate that a VLM trained on our data achieves significant performance gains on multiple spatial benchmarks and outperforms other open-source datasets of equivalent size. Furthermore, a scalability analysis confirms our hypothesis that overcoming the low-diversity nature of traditional template methods is essential for building robust, generalizable spatial intelligence. We will make the SPRITE framework code and the full 300k+ dataset publicly available to facilitate future research in spatial intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPRITE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u548c\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u5408\u6210\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7a7a\u95f4\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u96be\uff1a\u6a21\u677f\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4f46\u7ed3\u6784\u50f5\u5316\uff0c\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6837\u4f46\u4e0d\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7a81\u7834\u8fd9\u4e00\u56f0\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\u751f\u6210\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLMs\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u7a7a\u95f4\u95ee\u9898\u7f16\u8bd1\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u573a\u666f\u5143\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u8ba1\u7b97\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5305\u542b3\u4e2a\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u30011.1\u4e07+\u573a\u666f\u300130\u4e07+\u56fe\u50cf/\u89c6\u9891\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u5bf9\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u51fa\u7684VLM\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u7a7a\u95f4\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u540c\u7b49\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u5f00\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u677f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f4e\u591a\u6837\u6027\u672c\u8d28\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0cSPRITE\u6846\u67b6\u4ee3\u7801\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5c06\u5f00\u6e90\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

This limitation reflects an incomplete understanding of how specific flow features contribute to thrombus initiation and growth. This study introduces an interpretable machine learning framework for spatial thrombosis assessment based directly on computational fluid dynamics-derived flow features. A logistic regression (LR) model combined with a structured feature-selection pipeline is used to derive a compact and physically interpretable feature set, including nonlinear feature combinations. The framework is trained using spatial risk patterns from a validated, macro-scale thrombosis model for two representative scenarios. The model reproduces the labeled risk distributions and identifies distinct sets of flow features associated with increased thrombosis risk. When applied to a centrifugal pump, despite training on a single axial pump operating point, the model predicts plausible thrombosis-prone regions. These results show that interpretable machine learning can link local flow features to thrombosis risk while remaining computationally efficient and mechanistically transparent. The low computational cost enables rapid thrombogenicity screening without repeated or costly simulations. The proposed framework complements physics-based thrombosis modeling and provides a methodological basis for integrating interpretable machine learning into CFD-driven thrombosis analysis and device design workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although interaction detection for humans has been actively studied, a non-trivial challenge lies in cattle interaction detection, specifically the lack of a comprehensive behavioral dataset that includes interactions, as the interactions of grazing cattle are rare events. We, therefore, propose CattleAct, a data-efficient method for interaction detection by decomposing interactions into the combinations of actions by individual cattle. Specifically, we first learn an action latent space from a large-scale cattle action dataset. Then, we embed rare interactions via the fine-tuning of the pre-trained latent space using contrastive learning, thereby constructing a unified latent space of actions and interactions. On top of the proposed method, we develop a practical working system integrating video and GPS inputs.

Yet standard schemes (linear weight soups, task vectors, and Fisher-weighted averaging) can preserve loss while quietly destroying alignment. We argue that merging is not a numerical trick but a geometry-constrained operation around an already-aligned anchor: fusion must be steered to respect safety geometry, not validated post hoc.\n  We introduce AlignMerge, a geometry-aware merging framework that makes alignment an explicit invariant. In a local Fisher chart around an instruction-tuned base, we estimate an alignment subspace with projector P_A and optimize:\n  L_AlignMerge = L_geo + lambda_align * L_align + lambda_bud * L_bud,\n  where L_geo keeps the merge close to its experts in Fisher-Rao geometry, L_align penalizes motion along alignment-sensitive directions, and L_bud enforces a soft alignment budget.

While test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a promising approach for personalized prediction, the rarity of IOH events often leads to unreliable test-time training. To address this, we propose CSA-TTA, a novel Cross-Sample Augmented Test-Time Adaptation framework that enhances training by incorporating hypotension events from other individuals. Specifically, we first construct a cross-sample bank by segmenting historical data into hypotensive and non-hypotensive samples. Then, we introduce a coarse-to-fine retrieval strategy for building test-time training data: we initially apply K-Shape clustering to identify representative cluster centers and subsequently retrieve the top-K semantically similar samples based on the current patient signal. Additionally, we integrate both self-supervised masked reconstruction and retrospective sequence forecasting signals during training to enhance model adaptability to rapid and subtle intraoperative dynamics. We evaluate the proposed CSA-TTA on both the VitalDB dataset and a real-world in-hospital dataset by integrating it with state-of-the-art time series forecasting models, including TimesFM and UniTS. CSA-TTA consistently enhances performance across settings-for instance, on VitalDB, it improves Recall and F1 scores by +1.33% and +1.13%, respectively, under fine-tuning, and by +7.46% and +5.07% in zero-shot scenarios-demonstrating strong robustness and generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce AMUSE, a benchmark designed around tasks that are inherently agentic, requiring models to decompose complex audio-visual interactions into planning, grounding, and reflection steps. It evaluates MLLMs across three modes zero-shot, guided, and agentic and six task families, including spatio-temporal speaker grounding and multimodal dialogue summarization.

Second, how can multiple data owners collaboratively pool their resources to train superior models while fairly distributing the benefits? This problem, data valuation, which is not specific to large language models, has been addressed by the machine learning community through the lens of cooperative game theory, with the Shapley value being the prevalent solution concept. However, computing Shapley values is notoriously expensive for data valuation, typically requiring numerous model retrainings, which can become prohibitive for large machine learning models. In this work, we demonstrate that this computational challenge is dramatically simplified for LLMs trained with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).

The temporal complexity of embodied tasks demands a dynamic and adaptable computation mode. Static and lossy acceleration methods, such as quantization, fail to handle such dynamic embodied tasks, while speculative decoding offers a lossless and adaptive yet underexplored alternative for DP. However, it is non-trivial to address the following challenges: how to match the base model's denoising quality at lower cost under time-varying task difficulty in embodied settings, and how to dynamically and interactively adjust computation based on task difficulty in such environments. In this paper, we propose Temporal-aware Reinforcement-based Speculative Diffusion Policy (TS-DP), the first framework that enables speculative decoding for DP with temporal adaptivity. First, to handle dynamic environments where task difficulty varies over time, we distill a Transformer-based drafter to imitate the base model and replace its costly denoising calls. Second, an RL-based scheduler further adapts to time-varying task difficulty by adjusting speculative parameters to maintain accuracy while improving efficiency.

Proof of Quality (PoQ) replaces cryptographic verification of computation with consensus over output quality, but the original formulation ignores heterogeneous computational costs across inference and evaluator nodes. This paper introduces a cost-aware PoQ framework that integrates explicit efficiency measurements into the reward mechanism for both types of nodes. The design combines ground truth token level F1, lightweight learned evaluators, and GPT based judgments within a unified evaluation pipeline, and adopts a linear reward function that balances normalized quality and cost.\n  Experiments on extractive question answering and abstractive summarization use five instruction tuned LLMs ranging from TinyLlama-1.1B to Llama-3.2-3B and three evaluation models spanning cross encoder and bi encoder architectures. Results show that a semantic textual similarity bi encoder achieves much higher correlation with both ground truth and GPT scores than cross encoders, indicating that evaluator architecture is a critical design choice for PoQ. Quality-cost analysis further reveals that the largest models in the pool are also the most efficient in terms of quality per unit latency. Monte Carlo simulations over 5\\,000 PoQ rounds demonstrate that the cost-aware reward scheme consistently assigns higher average rewards to high quality low cost inference models and to efficient evaluators, while penalizing slow low quality nodes. These findings suggest that cost-aware PoQ provides a practical foundation for economically sustainable decentralized LLM inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, the Gaussian kernel's lack of data-dependence and computational overhead limit its scalability and effectiveness for categorical biological sequences. Recent work proposed the isolation kernel as an alternative, yet it may not optimally capture sequence similarities. In this study, we comprehensively evaluate nine different kernel functions for t-SNE applied to molecular sequences, using three embedding methods: One-Hot Encoding, Spike2Vec, and minimizers. Through both subjective visualization and objective metrics (including neighborhood preservation scores), we demonstrate that the cosine similarity kernel in general outperforms other kernels, including Gaussian and isolation kernels, achieving superior runtime efficiency and better preservation of pairwise distances in low-dimensional space. We further validate our findings through extensive classification and clustering experiments across six diverse biological datasets (Spike7k, Host, ShortRead, Rabies, Genome, and Breast Cancer), employing multiple machine learning algorithms and evaluation metrics. Our results show that kernel selection significantly impacts not only visualization quality but also downstream analytical tasks, with the cosine similarity kernel providing the most robust performance across different data types and embedding strategies, making it particularly suitable for large-scale biological sequence analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, comparing point clouds faces significant challenges due to their unstructured nature and the complex geometry of the surfaces they represent. Traditional geometric metrics such as Hausdorff and Chamfer distances often fail to capture global statistical structure and exhibit sensitivity to outliers, while existing Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence approximations for Gaussian Mixture Models can produce unbounded or numerically unstable values. This paper introduces an information geometric framework for 3D point cloud shape analysis by representing point clouds as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) on a statistical manifold. We prove that the space of GMMs forms a statistical manifold and propose the Modified Symmetric Kullback-Leibler (MSKL) divergence with theoretically guaranteed upper and lower bounds, ensuring numerical stability for all GMM comparisons. Through comprehensive experiments on human pose discrimination (MPI-FAUST dataset) and animal shape comparison (G-PCD dataset), we demonstrate that MSKL provides stable and monotonically varying values that directly reflect geometric variation, outperforming traditional distances and existing KL approximations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\u76843D\u70b9\u4e91\u5f62\u72b6\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u70b9\u4e91\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u7edf\u8ba1\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86GMM\u6784\u6210\u7edf\u8ba1\u6d41\u5f62\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u754c\u548c\u4e0b\u754c\u7684MSKL\u6563\u5ea6\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e09\u7ef4\u70b9\u4e91\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u5176\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u548c\u8868\u9762\u51e0\u4f55\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u70b9\u4e91\u6bd4\u8f83\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u51e0\u4f55\u5ea6\u91cf\u5982Hausdorff\u548cChamfer\u8ddd\u79bb\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5168\u5c40\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\u4e14\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684GMM KL\u6563\u5ea6\u8fd1\u4f3c\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u65e0\u754c\u6216\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6570\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u70b9\u4e91\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u7edf\u8ba1\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660eGMM\u7a7a\u95f4\u6784\u6210\u7edf\u8ba1\u6d41\u5f62\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5bf9\u79f0Kullback-Leibler\u6563\u5ea6\uff0c\u8be5\u6563\u5ea6\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6240\u6709GMM\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u52a8\u7269\u5f62\u72b6\u6bd4\u8f83\u7b49\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cMSKL\u6563\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u5355\u8c03\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u503c\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u7684KL\u6563\u5ea6\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a3D\u70b9\u4e91\u5f62\u72b6\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u70b9\u4e91\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

The contributions collected here span applications from automated equation discovery and emergent-phenomena modelling to the construction of compact emulators for computationally expensive simulations.\n  The introductory review outlines the conceptual foundations of SR, contrasts it with conventional regression approaches, and surveys its main use cases in the physical sciences, including the derivation of effective theories, empirical functional forms and surrogate models. We summarise methodological considerations such as search-space design, operator selection, complexity control, feature selection, and integration with modern AI approaches. We also highlight ongoing challenges, including scalability, robustness to noise, overfitting and computational complexity.

Despite their shared goal, these models have disparate algorithms, theoretical structures, and tradeoffs: discrete diffusion has the most natural domain, Gaussian diffusion has more mature algorithms, and diffusion on the simplex in principle combines the strengths of the other two but in practice suffers from a numerically unstable stochastic processes. Ideally we could see each of these models as instances of the same underlying framework, and enable practitioners to switch between models for downstream applications. However previous theories have only considered connections in special cases. Here we build a theory unifying all three methods of discrete diffusion as different parameterizations of the same underlying process: the Wright-Fisher population genetics model. In particular, we find simplicial and Gaussian diffusion as two large-population limits. Our theory formally connects the likelihoods and hyperparameters of these models and leverages decades of mathematical genetics literature to unlock stable simplicial diffusion. Finally, we relieve the practitioner of balancing model trade-offs by demonstrating it is possible to train a single model that can perform diffusion in any of these three domains at test time. Our experiments show that Wright-Fisher simplicial diffusion is more stable and outperforms previous simplicial diffusion models on conditional DNA generation. We also show that we can train models on multiple domains at once that are competitive with models trained on any individual domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Results show that the low-rank approximations often produce images that appear visually similar to the originals, but the compression efficiency remains consistently worse than established formats such as JPEG, JPEG2000, and WEBP at comparable error levels.

Synthelite can generate end-to-end synthesis routes by harnessing the intrinsic chemical knowledge and reasoning capabilities of LLMs, while allowing expert intervention through natural language prompts. Our experiments demonstrate that Synthelite can flexibly adapt its planning trajectory to diverse user-specified constraints, achieving up to 95\\% success rates in both strategy-constrained and starting-material-constrained synthesis tasks.

Yet, VLM decisions are influenced by the perceived demographic attributes of people in the input, which can lead to biased outcomes like failing to identify women as doctors. Moreover, when reducing bias leads to performance loss, users may have varying needs for balancing bias mitigation with overall model capabilities, highlighting the demand for methods that enable controllable bias reduction during inference. Activation steering is a popular approach for inference-time controllability that has shown potential in inducing safer behavior in large language models (LLMs). However, we observe that current steering methods struggle to correct biases, where equiprobable outcomes across demographic groups are required. To address this, we propose Direct Steering Optimization (DSO) which uses reinforcement learning to find linear transformations for steering activations, tailored to mitigate bias while maintaining control over model performance. We demonstrate that DSO achieves state-of-the-art trade-off between fairness and capabilities on both VLMs and LLMs, while offering practitioners inference-time control over the trade-off.

Conventional supervised learning methods often falter in this domain, struggling to generalize to unseen species and to capture the hierarchical nature of the data. To address these limitations, we introduce BarcodeMamba+, a foundation model for fungal barcode classification built on a powerful and efficient state-space model architecture. We employ a pretrain and fine-tune paradigm, which utilizes partially labelled data and we demonstrate this is substantially more effective than traditional fully-supervised methods in this data-sparse environment. During fine-tuning, we systematically integrate and evaluate a suite of enhancements--including hierarchical label smoothing, a weighted loss function, and a multi-head output layer from MycoAI--to specifically tackle the challenges of fungal taxonomy. Our experiments show that each of these components yields significant performance gains. On a challenging fungal classification benchmark with distinct taxonomic distribution shifts from the broad training set, our final model outperforms a range of existing methods across all taxonomic levels. Our work provides a powerful new tool for genomics-based biodiversity research and establishes an effective and scalable training paradigm for this challenging domain.

However, due to the difficulty of collecting and annotating multi-view images, the datasets for multi-view counting have a limited number of multi-view frames and scenes. To solve the problem of limited data, one approach is to collect synthetic data to bypass the annotating step, while another is to propose semi- or weakly-supervised or unsupervised methods that demand less multi-view data. In this paper, we propose two semi-supervised multi-view crowd counting frameworks by ranking the multi-view fusion models of different numbers of input views, in terms of the model predictions or the model uncertainties. Specifically, for the first method (vanilla model), we rank the multi-view fusion models' prediction results of different numbers of camera-view inputs, namely, the model's predictions with fewer camera views shall not be larger than the predictions with more camera views. For the second method, we rank the estimated model uncertainties of the multi-view fusion models with a variable number of view inputs, guided by the multi-view fusion models' prediction errors, namely, the model uncertainties with more camera views shall not be larger than those with fewer camera views. These constraints are introduced into the model training in a semi-supervised fashion for multi-view counting with limited labeled data.

Here, we introduce FLIM_PSR_k, a deep learning-based multi-channel pixel super-resolution (PSR) framework that reconstructs high-resolution FLIM images from data acquired with up to a 5-fold increased pixel size. The model is trained using the conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) framework, which, compared to diffusion model-based alternatives, delivers a more robust PSR reconstruction with substantially shorter inference times, a crucial advantage for practical deployment. FLIM_PSR_k not only enables faster image acquisition but can also alleviate SNR limitations in autofluorescence-based FLIM. Blind testing on held-out patient-derived tumor tissue samples demonstrates that FLIM_PSR_k reliably achieves a super-resolution factor of k = 5, resulting in a 25-fold increase in the space-bandwidth product of the output images and revealing fine architectural features lost in lower-resolution inputs, with statistically significant improvements across various image quality metrics.

However, text editing within images remains largely unexplored, as it requires generating legible characters while preserving semantic, geometric, and contextual coherence. To fill this gap, we introduce TextEditBench, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark that explicitly focuses on text-centric regions in images. Beyond basic pixel manipulations, our benchmark emphasizes reasoning-intensive editing scenarios that require models to understand physical plausibility, linguistic meaning, and cross-modal dependencies. We further propose a novel evaluation dimension, Semantic Expectation (SE), which measures reasoning ability of model to maintain semantic consistency, contextual coherence, and cross-modal alignment during text editing. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art editing systems reveal that while current models can follow simple textual instructions, they still struggle with context-dependent reasoning, physical consistency, and layout-aware integration.

While recent deep learning approaches have improved the state of the art, they often struggle to capture architectural reasoning: the precedence of topological relationships over geometric instantiation, the propagation of functional constraints through adjacency networks, and the emergence of circulation patterns from local connectivity decisions. To address these fundamental challenges, this paper introduces GFLAN, a generative framework that restructures floor plan synthesis through explicit factorization into topological planning and geometric realization. Given a single exterior boundary and a front-door location, our approach departs from direct pixel-to-pixel or wall-tracing generation in favor of a principled two-stage decomposition. Stage A employs a specialized convolutional architecture with dual encoders -- separating invariant spatial context from evolving layout state -- to sequentially allocate room centroids within the building envelope via discrete probability maps over feasible placements.

Despite progress in improving visual realism through advanced simulators and generative AI, recent studies reveal that pixel-level fidelity alone does not ensure reliable transfer from simulation to the real world. What truly matters is whether the system-under-test (SUT) bases its decisions on the same causal evidence in both real and simulated environments - not just whether images \"look real\" to humans. This paper addresses the lack of such a behavior-grounded fidelity measure by introducing Decisive Feature Fidelity (DFF), a new SUT-specific metric that extends the existing fidelity spectrum to capture mechanism parity - the agreement in causal evidence underlying the SUT's decisions across domains. DFF leverages explainable-AI (XAI) methods to identify and compare the decisive features driving the SUT's outputs for matched real-synthetic pairs. We further propose practical estimators based on counterfactual explanations, along with a DFF-guided calibration scheme to enhance simulator fidelity. Experiments on 2126 matched KITTI-VirtualKITTI2 pairs demonstrate that DFF reveals discrepancies overlooked by conventional output-value fidelity. Furthermore, results show that DFF-guided calibration improves decisive-feature and input-level fidelity without sacrificing output value fidelity across diverse SUTs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Decisive Feature Fidelity\uff08DFF\uff09\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u5728\u865a\u62df\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4eff\u771f\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u51b3\u7b56\u57fa\u4e8e\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u865a\u62df\u6d4b\u8bd5\u867d\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u51b3\u7b56\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f9d\u8d56\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u57fa\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDFF\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522bSUT\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u771f\u5b9e-\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u4e2d\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u7279\u5f81\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1DFF\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u5668\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "\u57282126\u4e2a\u5339\u914d\u7684KITTI-VirtualKITTI2\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDFF\u80fd\u53d1\u73b0\u4f20\u7edf\u8f93\u51fa\u503c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff1bDFF\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u80fd\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u8f93\u51fa\u503c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u7ea7\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "DFF\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u884c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u786e\u4fdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u51b3\u7b56\u4f9d\u8d56\u76f8\u540c\u56e0\u679c\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0cDFF\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4eff\u771f\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Commodity RFID systems suffer from poor tag localization when dispersed in forested environments due to signal attenuation, multi-path effects and environmental variability. Current methods to address this issue via fingerprinting rely on dispersing tags at known locations {\\em a priori}. In this paper, we address the case when it is not possible to tag known locations and show that it is possible to localize tags to accuracies comparable to global positioning systems (GPS) without such a constraint. For this, we propose Gaussian Process to model various environments solely based on RF signal response signatures and without the aid of additional sensors such as global positioning GPS or cameras, and match an unknown RF to the closest match in a model dictionary. We utilize a new weighted log-likelihood method to associate an unknown environment with the closest environment in a dictionary of previously modeled environments, which is a crucial step in being able to use our approach. Our results show that it is possible to achieve localization accuracies of the order of GPS, but with passive commodity RFID, which will allow the tracking of dozens of wildfire assets within the vicinity of mobile readers at-a-time simultaneously, does not require known positions to be tagged {\\em a priori}, and can achieve localization at a fraction of the cost compared to GPS.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5546\u54c1RFID\u7684\u68ee\u6797\u8d44\u4ea7\u8ffd\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u73af\u5883RF\u4fe1\u53f7\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5df2\u77e5\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6807\u7b7e\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1GPS\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u68ee\u6797\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u5546\u54c1RFID\u7cfb\u7edf\u7531\u4e8e\u4fe1\u53f7\u8870\u51cf\u3001\u591a\u5f84\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5dee\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6307\u7eb9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u4e8b\u5148\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u4f4d\u7f6e\u90e8\u7f72\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u73af\u5883\u7684RF\u4fe1\u53f7\u54cd\u5e94\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u73af\u5883\u6a21\u578b\u8bcd\u5178\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u52a0\u6743\u5bf9\u6570\u4f3c\u7136\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u672a\u77e5\u73af\u5883\u7684RF\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u8bcd\u5178\u4e2d\u6700\u5339\u914d\u7684\u73af\u5883\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u5df2\u77e5\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "result": "\u65e0\u9700GPS\u6216\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u7b49\u989d\u5916\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u88ab\u52a8\u5546\u54c1RFID\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1GPS\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6570\u5341\u4e2a\u68ee\u6797\u8d44\u4ea7\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u8fdc\u4f4e\u4e8eGPS\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u68ee\u6797\u706b\u707e\u54cd\u5e94\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8d44\u4ea7\u8ffd\u8e2a\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfRFID\u5b9a\u4f4d\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5df2\u77e5\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6807\u7b7e\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002"}}

While traditional low-rank approximations often rely on static rank assumptions--limiting their flexibility across diverse input contexts--our method dynamically selects ranks based on real-time sequence dynamics, layer-specific sensitivities, and hardware constraints. The core innovation lies in an RL agent that formulates rank selection as a sequential policy optimization problem, where the reward function strictly balances attention fidelity against computational latency. Crucially, we employ online matrix perturbation bounds to enable incremental rank updates, thereby avoiding the prohibitive cost of full decomposition during inference. Furthermore, the integration of a lightweight Transformer-based policy network and batched Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) operations ensures scalable deployment on modern GPU architectures. Experiments demonstrate that DR-RL maintains downstream accuracy statistically equivalent to full-rank attention while significantly reducing Floating Point Operations (FLOPs), particularly in long-sequence regimes (L > 4096). This work bridges the gap between adaptive efficiency and theoretical rigor in MHSA, offering a principled, mathematically grounded alternative to heuristic rank reduction techniques in resource-constrained deep learning.

We study the following fundamental setting for learning features in superposition from black-box query access: we are given query access to a function \\[ f(x)=\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i\\,\u03c3_i(v_i^\\top x), \\] where each unit vector $v_i$ encodes a feature direction and $\u03c3_i:\\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ is an arbitrary response function and our goal is to recover the $v_i$ and the function $f$.\n  In learning-theoretic terms, superposition refers to the overcomplete regime, when the number of features is larger than the underlying dimension (i.e. $n > d$), which has proven especially challenging for typical algorithmic approaches. Our main result is an efficient query algorithm that, from noisy oracle access to $f$, identifies all feature directions whose responses are non-degenerate and reconstructs the function $f$. Crucially, our algorithm works in a significantly more general setting than all related prior results -- we allow for essentially arbitrary superpositions, only requiring that $v_i, v_j$ are not nearly identical for $i \\neq j$, and general response functions $\u03c3_i$. At a high level, our algorithm introduces an approach for searching in Fourier space by iteratively refining the search space to locate the hidden directions $v_i$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u53e0\u52a0\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8bc6\u522b\u975e\u9000\u5316\u54cd\u5e94\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u5411\u5e76\u91cd\u5efa\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u590d\u6742\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u8868\u793a\u7f16\u7801\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u7279\u5f81\u4ee5\u53e0\u52a0\u5f62\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u96be\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8fc7\u5b8c\u5907\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\uff08\u7279\u5f81\u6570\u91cf\u5927\u4e8e\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u4e25\u5cfb\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u610f\u53e0\u52a0\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "method": "\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0oracle\u8bbf\u95ee\u8fdb\u884c\u5085\u7acb\u53f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ec6\u5316\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u6765\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9690\u85cf\u7684$v_i$\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u521b\u65b0\u662f\u652f\u6301\u5e7f\u6cdb\u53e0\u52a0\uff08\u4ec5\u8981\u6c42$v_i, v_j$\u4e0d\u63a5\u8fd1\u76f8\u540c\uff09\u548c\u4e00\u822c\u54cd\u5e94\u51fd\u6570$\u03c3_i$\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u8981\u6210\u679c\u662f\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u5bf9$f$\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u8bc6\u522b\u6240\u6709\u975e\u9000\u5316\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u5411\u5e76\u91cd\u5efa\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u76f8\u5173\u7814\u7a76\u66f4\u4e00\u822c\u7684\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u8fc7\u5b8c\u5907\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u4ece\u53e0\u52a0\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d\u9690\u85cf\u7279\u5f81\u65b9\u5411\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Although graphics processors dominate modern artificial-intelligence deployment, most consumer hardware--including laptops, desktops, industrial controllers, and embedded systems--relies on central processing units. Despite this, the computational laws governing central-processing-unit-only inference for local language and vision-language workloads remain largely unexplored. We systematically benchmark large language and vision-language models on two representative central-processing-unit tiers widely used for local inference: a MacBook Pro M2, reflecting mainstream laptop-class deployment, and a Raspberry Pi 5, representing constrained, low-power embedded settings. Using a unified methodology based on continuous sampling of processor and memory usage together with area-under-curve integration, we characterize how computational load scales with input text length for language models and with image resolution for vision-language models. We uncover two empirical scaling laws: (1) computational cost for language-model inference scales approximately linearly with token length; and (2) vision-language models exhibit a preprocessing-driven \"resolution knee\", where compute remains constant above an internal resolution clamp and decreases sharply below it. Beyond these laws, we show that quantum-inspired compression reduces processor and memory usage by up to 71.9% and energy consumption by up to 62%, while preserving or improving semantic accuracy. These results provide a systematic quantification of multimodal central-processing-unit-only scaling for local language and vision-language workloads, and they identify model compression and input-resolution preprocessing as effective, low-cost levers for sustainable edge inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

QUIDS introduces a novel metric, Aggregated Sensing Quality (ASQ), to quantitatively capture QoI by integrating both coverage and reliability. We also develop a Mutually Assisted Belief-aware Vehicle Dispatching algorithm that estimates sensing reliability and allocates incentives under uncertainty, further improving ASQ. Evaluation using real-world data from a metropolitan NVMCS deployment shows QUIDS improves ASQ by 38% over non-dispatching scenarios and by 10% over state-of-the-art methods. It also reduces reconstruction map errors by 39-74% across algorithms.

In typical deployments, visual data captured at edge devices (clients) is transmitted to the server for VLM inference. However, resizing the original image (global image) to match the vision encoder's input resolution often discards fine-grained details, leading to accuracy degradation. To overcome this limitation, we design a two-stage framework. In the first stage, the server performs inference on the global image and identifies a region of interest (RoI) using the VLM's internal attention. The min-entropy of the output tokens is then computed as a confidence measure to determine whether retransmission is required. If the min-entropy exceeds a predefined threshold, the server requests the edge device to send a detail-preserved local image of the RoI. The server then refines its inference by jointly leveraging the global and local images. This selective retransmission strategy ensures that only essential visual content is transmitted.

However, directly applying LDMs to HDR remains challenging due to: (1) limited dynamic-range representation caused by 8-bit latent compression, (2) high inference cost from multi-step denoising, and (3) content hallucination inherent to generative nature. To address these challenges, we introduce GMODiff, a gain map-driven one-step diffusion framework for multi-exposure HDR reconstruction. Instead of reconstructing full HDR content, we reformulate HDR reconstruction as a conditionally guided Gain Map (GM) estimation task, where the GM encodes the extended dynamic range while retaining the same bit depth as LDR images. We initialize the denoising process from an informative regression-based estimate rather than pure noise, enabling the model to generate high-quality GMs in a single denoising step. Furthermore, recognizing that regression-based models excel in content fidelity while LDMs favor perceptual quality, we leverage regression priors to guide both the denoising process and latent decoding of the LDM, suppressing hallucinations while preserving structural accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our GMODiff performs favorably against several state-of-the-art methods and is 100 faster than previous LDM-based methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

During inference, the method requires only a single log-probability computation over the probe prefixes to produce a harmfulness score and apply a threshold, without invoking any additional models or multi-stage inference. To further enhance the discriminative power of the prefixes, we design an efficient prefix construction algorithm that automatically discovers highly informative prefixes, substantially improving detection performance.

We review key Big Data characteristics and survey major analytical tools, including distributed storage systems, streaming platforms, and advanced fraud detection models such as anomaly detectors, graph-based approaches, and ensemble classifiers. We also present a structured review of widely used XAI methods, including LIME, SHAP, counterfactual explanations, and attention mechanisms, and analyze their strengths and limitations when deployed at scale. Based on these findings, we identify key research gaps related to scalability, real-time processing, and explainability for graph and temporal models.

However, extending these advances to multi-character settings is non-trivial, especially when position swap is involved. Beyond mere scaling, the core challenge lies in enforcing correct Identity Correspondence (IC) between characters in reference and generated frames. To address this, we introduce EverybodyDance, a systematic solution targeting IC correctness in multi-character animation. EverybodyDance is built around the Identity Matching Graph (IMG), which models characters in the generated and reference frames as two node sets in a weighted complete bipartite graph. Edge weights, computed via our proposed Mask-Query Attention (MQA), quantify the affinity between each pair of characters. Our key insight is to formalize IC correctness as a graph structural metric and to optimize it during training. We also propose a series of targeted strategies tailored for multi-character animation, including identity-embedded guidance, a multi-scale matching strategy, and pre-classified sampling, which work synergistically. Finally, to evaluate IC performance, we curate the Identity Correspondence Evaluation benchmark, dedicated to multi-character IC correctness.

We are witnessing the rise of a dangerous literacy gap, where a focus on the functional, operational skills of using AI tools is eclipsing the development of critical and ethical reasoning about them. This position paper argues for a systemic shift toward comprehensive AI literacy that centers human agency - the empowered capacity for intentional, critical, and responsible choice. This principle applies to all stakeholders in the educational ecosystem: it is the student's agency to question, create with, or consciously decide not to use AI based on the task; it is the teacher's agency to design learning experiences that align with instructional values, rather than ceding pedagogical control to a tool. True literacy involves teaching about agency itself, framing technology not as an inevitability to be adopted, but as a choice to be made. This requires a deep commitment to critical thinking and a robust understanding of epistemology. Through the AI Literacy, Fluency, and Competency frameworks described in this paper, educators and students will become agents in their own human-centric approaches to AI, providing necessary pathways to clearly articulate the intentions informing decisions and attitudes toward AI and the impact of these decisions on academic work, career, and society.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While deep learning models have achieved strong predictive performance, they often overlook underlying physical processes, limiting interpretability and generalization. Recent causal learning approaches address these issues by integrating domain knowledge, yet they typically rely on fixed causal graphs that fail to adapt to data. We propose CauStream, a unified framework for causal spatiotemporal streamflow forecasting. CauSTream jointly learns (i) a runoff causal graph among meteorological forcings and (ii) a routing graph capturing dynamic dependencies across stations. We further establish identifiability conditions for these causal structures under a nonparametric setting. We evaluate CauSTream on three major U.S. river basins across three forecasting horizons. The model consistently outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods, with performance gaps widening at longer forecast windows, indicating stronger generalization to unseen conditions.

In this paper, we argue that many errors, including apparent motion failures, originate from the model's inability to construct a semantically correct or logically consistent initial frame. We introduce Factorized Video Generation (FVG), a pipeline that decouples these tasks by decomposing the Text-to-Video generation into three specialized stages: (1) Reasoning, where a Large Language Model (LLM) rewrites the video prompt to describe only the initial scene, resolving temporal ambiguities; (2) Composition, where a Text-to-Image (T2I) model synthesizes a high-quality, compositionally-correct anchor frame from this new prompt; and (3) Temporal Synthesis, where a video model, finetuned to understand this anchor, focuses its entire capacity on animating the scene and following the prompt. Our decomposed approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the T2V CompBench benchmark and significantly improves all tested models on VBench2. Furthermore, we show that visual anchoring allows us to cut the number of sampling steps by 70% without any loss in performance, leading to a substantial speed-up in sampling. Factorized Video Generation offers a simple yet practical path toward more efficient, robust, and controllable video synthesis", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Next, an association rule mining analysis was conducted using the Apriori algorithm with support, confidence, and lift parameters. The results show the existence of meaningful association patterns such as the relationship between rakaat-prayer, verse-revelation, and hadith-story, which describe the themes of worship, revelation, and hadith narration.

ICL had originally been thought to emerge from the self-attention mechanism in autoregressive transformer architectures. DeepOSets is a non-autoregressive, non-attention based neural architecture that combines set learning via the DeepSets architecture with operator learning via Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets). In a previous study, DeepOSets was shown to display ICL capabilities in supervised learning problems. In this paper, we show that the DeepOSets architecture, with the appropriate modifications, is a multi-operator in-context learner that can recover the solution operator of a new PDE, not seen during training, from example pairs of parameter and solution placed in a user prompt, without any weight updates. Furthermore, we show that DeepOSets is a universal uniform approximator over a class of continuous operators, which we believe is the first result of its kind in the literature of scientific machine learning. This means that a single DeepOSets architecture exists that approximates in-context any continuous operator in the class to any fixed desired degree accuracy, given an appropriate number of examples in the prompt.

We systematically compare single-agent and multi-agent pipelines on four visual math benchmarks: Geometry3K, MathVerse, OlympiadBench, and We-Math. For open-source models, multi-agent consistently improves performance. For example, Qwen-2.5-VL (7B) gains +6.8 points and Qwen-2.5-VL (32B) gains +3.3 on Geometry3K, and both Qwen-2.5-VL variants see further gains on OlympiadBench and We-Math. In contrast, the closed-source Gemini-2.0-Flash generally performs better in single-agent mode on classic benchmarks, while multi-agent yields only modest improvements on the newer We-Math dataset. These findings show that multi-agent pipelines provide clear benefits for open-source models and can assist strong proprietary systems on newer, less familiar benchmarks, but agentic decomposition is not universally optimal.

At the same time, released data should retain its usefulness for model-training. The standard method for private information obfuscation in images is Gaussian blurring. In this work, we show that practical implementations of Gaussian blurring are reversible enough to break privacy. We then take a closer look at the privacy-utility tradeoffs offered by three other obfuscation algorithms -- pixelization, pixelization and noise addition (DP-Pix), and cropping. Privacy is evaluated by reversal and discrimination attacks, while utility by the quality of the learnt representations when the model is trained on data with obfuscated faces.

We present AIMM, an AI-driven framework that fuses Reddit activity, bot and coordination indicators, and OHLCV market features into a daily AIMM Manipulation Risk Score for each ticker.\n  The system uses a parquet-native pipeline with a Streamlit dashboard that allows analysts to explore suspicious windows, inspect underlying posts and price action, and log model outputs over time. Due to Reddit API restrictions, we employ calibrated synthetic social features matching documented event characteristics; market data (OHLCV) uses real historical data from Yahoo Finance. This release makes three contributions. First, we build the AIMM Ground Truth dataset (AIMM-GT): 33 labeled ticker-days spanning eight equities, drawing from SEC enforcement actions, community-verified manipulation cases, and matched normal controls. Second, we implement forward-walk evaluation and prospective prediction logging for both retrospective and deployment-style assessment. Third, we analyze lead times and show that AIMM flagged GME 22 days before the January 2021 squeeze peak.\n  The current labeled set is small (33 ticker-days, 3 positive events), but results show preliminary discriminative capability and early warnings for the GME incident.

In the first stage, an adaptive UV sampling strategy converts Breps into graphs representation with geometric and topological information. We then design a hierarchical BrepEncoder to extract features from geometry (i.e., faces and edges) and topology, producing both a single global token and a sequence of node tokens. Then we align the global token with text embeddings from a frozen CLIP text encoder (ViT-L/14) via contrastive learning. In the second stage, we integrate the pretrained BrepEncoder into an LLM. We then align its sequence of node tokens using a three-stage progressive training strategy: (1) training an MLP-based semantic mapping from Brep representation to 2D with 2D-LLM priors. (2) performing fine-tuning of the LLM. (3) designing a Mixture-of-Query Experts (MQE) to enhance geometric diversity modeling.

Under a linear Gaussian structural equation model (SEM) with equal noise variances, the problem is identifiable and we show that the ensemble precision matrix of the observations exhibits a distinctive structure that facilitates DAG recovery. Exploiting this property, we propose BUILD (Bottom-Up Inference of Linear DAGs), a deterministic stepwise algorithm that identifies leaf nodes and their parents, then prunes the leaves by removing incident edges to proceed to the next step, exactly reconstructing the DAG from the true precision matrix. In practice, precision matrices must be estimated from finite data, and ill-conditioning may lead to error accumulation across BUILD steps. As a mitigation strategy, we periodically re-estimate the precision matrix (with less variables as leaves are pruned), trading off runtime for enhanced robustness. Reproducible results on challenging synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that BUILD compares favorably to state-of-the-art DAG learning algorithms, while offering an explicit handle on complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this, we propose CountZES, a training-free framework for object counting via zero-shot exemplar selection. CountZES progressively discovers diverse exemplars through three synergistic stages: Detection-Anchored Exemplar (DAE), Density-Guided Exemplar (DGE), and Feature-Consensus Exemplar (FCE). DAE refines open-vocabulary detections to isolate precise single-instance exemplars. DGE introduces a density-driven, self-supervised paradigm to identify statistically consistent and semantically compact exemplars, while FCE reinforces visual coherence through feature-space clustering. Together, these stages yield a diverse, complementary exemplar set that balances textual grounding, count consistency, and feature representativeness. Experiments on diverse datasets demonstrate CountZES superior performance among ZOC methods while generalizing effectively across natural, aerial and medical domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Prior works have primarily focused on the privacy of data that has been unlearned, while the risks to retained data remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we focus on the privacy risks of retained data and, for the first time, reveal the vulnerabilities introduced by machine unlearning under the dual-view setting, where an adversary can query both the original and the unlearned models. From an information-theoretic perspective, we introduce the concept of {privacy knowledge gain} and demonstrate that the dual-view setting allows adversaries to obtain more information than querying either model alone, thereby amplifying privacy leakage. To effectively demonstrate this threat, we propose DVIA, a Dual-View Inference Attack, which extracts membership information on retained data using black-box queries to both models. DVIA eliminates the need to train an attack model and employs a lightweight likelihood ratio inference module for efficient inference. Experiments across different datasets and model architectures validate the effectiveness of DVIA and highlight the privacy risks inherent in the dual-view setting.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Integrating these modalities improved sensitivity and interpretability. Our framework achieved an accuracy of 0.874 (48h) and 0.917 (72h), with an improvement in sensitivity of 8.6% and 10.4% due to the augmentation of large language model.

We focus on the well-studied behaviour of priming an object/location for pick up or put down -- that is, the spotting of an object/location from a distance, known as gaze priming, followed by the motion of approaching and reaching the target location. To that end, we curate, for the first time, 23.7K gaze-primed human motion sequences for reaching target object locations from five publicly available datasets, i.e., HD-EPIC, MoGaze, HOT3D, ADT, and GIMO. We pre-train a text-conditioned diffusion-based motion generation model, then fine-tune it conditioned on goal pose or location, on our curated sequences. Importantly, we evaluate the ability of the generated motion to imitate natural human movement through several metrics, including the 'Reach Success' and a newly introduced 'Prime Success' metric.

However, the VAR paradigm suffers from sharply increased computational complexity and running time at large-scale steps. Although existing acceleration methods reduce runtime for large-scale steps, but rely on manual step selection and overlook the varying importance of different stages in the generation process. To address this challenge, we present StageVAR, a systematic study and stage-aware acceleration framework for VAR models. Our analysis shows that early steps are critical for preserving semantic and structural consistency and should remain intact, while later steps mainly refine details and can be pruned or approximated for acceleration. Building on these insights, StageVAR introduces a plug-and-play acceleration strategy that exploits semantic irrelevance and low-rank properties in late-stage computations, without requiring additional training. Our proposed StageVAR achieves up to 3.4x speedup with only a 0.01 drop on GenEval and a 0.26 decrease on DPG, consistently outperforming existing acceleration baselines.

Despite its widespread use, the theoretical understanding of rank-based ZO methods remains limited: existing analyses provide only asymptotic insights and do not yield explicit convergence rates for algorithms selecting the top-$k$ directions.\n  This work closes this gap by analyzing a simple rank-based ZO algorithm and establishing the first \\emph{explicit}, and \\emph{non-asymptotic} query complexities. For a $d$-dimension problem, if the function is $L$-smooth and $\u03bc$-strongly convex, the algorithm achieves $\\widetilde{\\mathcal O}\\!\\left(\\frac{dL}\u03bc\\log\\!\\frac{dL}{\u03bc\u03b4}\\log\\!\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$ to find an $\\varepsilon$-suboptimal solution, and for smooth nonconvex objectives it reaches $\\mathcal O\\!\\left(\\frac{dL}{\\varepsilon}\\log\\!\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$.

In this work, we investigate how a model can acquire both human-like and self-consistent reasoning capability for blind image quality assessment (BIQA). We first collect human evaluation data that capture several aspects of human perception-reasoning pipeline. Then, we adopt reinforcement learning, using human annotations as reward signals to guide the model toward human-like perception and reasoning. To enable the model to internalize self-consistent reasoning capability, we design a reward that drives the model to infer the image quality purely from self-generated descriptions. Empirically, our approach achieves score prediction performance comparable to state-of-the-art BIQA systems under general metrics, including Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients. In addition to the rating score, we assess human-model alignment using ROUGE-1 to measure the similarity between model-generated and human perception-reasoning chains. On over 1,000 human-annotated samples, our model reaches a ROUGE-1 score of 0.512 (cf. 0.443 for baseline), indicating substantial coverage of human explanations and marking a step toward human-like interpretable reasoning in BIQA.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Currently, the field heavily relies on facial expression recognition (FER) because visual channel conveys rich emotional cues. However, facial expressions are often used as social tools rather than manifestations of genuine inner emotions. To understand and bridge this gap between FER and ER, we introduce eye behaviors as an important emotional cue and construct an Eye-behavior-aided Multimodal Emotion Recognition (EMER) dataset. To collect data with genuine emotions, spontaneous emotion induction paradigm is exploited with stimulus material, during which non-invasive eye behavior data, like eye movement sequences and eye fixation maps, is captured together with facial expression videos. To better illustrate the gap between ER and FER, multi-view emotion labels for mutimodal ER and FER are separately annotated. Furthermore, based on the new dataset, we design a simple yet effective Eye-behavior-aided MER Transformer (EMERT) that enhances ER by bridging the emotion gap. EMERT leverages modality-adversarial feature decoupling and a multitask Transformer to model eye behaviors as a strong complement to facial expressions. In the experiment, we introduce seven multimodal benchmark protocols for a variety of comprehensive evaluations of the EMER dataset. The results show that the EMERT outperforms other state-of-the-art multimodal methods by a great margin, revealing the importance of modeling eye behaviors for robust ER. To sum up, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the importance of eye behaviors in ER, advancing the study on addressing the gap between FER and ER for more robust ER performance.

Existing methods typically treat all OOD samples as a single class, despite real-world applications, especially high-stake settings such as fraud detection and medical diagnosis, demanding deeper insights into OOD samples, including their probable labels. This raises a critical question: can OOD detection be extended to OOD classification without true label information? To address this question, we propose a Coarse-to-Fine open-set Classification (CFC) framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for graph datasets. CFC consists of three key components: a coarse classifier that uses LLM prompts for OOD detection and outlier label generation, a GNN-based fine classifier trained with OOD samples identified by the coarse classifier for enhanced OOD detection and ID classification, and refined OOD classification achieved through LLM prompts and post-processed OOD labels. Unlike methods that rely on synthetic or auxiliary OOD samples, CFC employs semantic OOD instances that are genuinely out-of-distribution based on their inherent meaning, improving interpretability and practical utility. Experimental results show that CFC improves OOD detection by ten percent over state-of-the-art methods on graph and text domains and achieves up to seventy percent accuracy in OOD classification on graph datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Conventional detectors such as YOLO are optimised for standard image sizes (for example, 640x640 pixels) and often struggle with the computational demands of 4K or higher-resolution imagery typical of 360-degree vision. To address these limitations, we introduce YOLO11-4K, an efficient real-time detection framework tailored for 4K panoramic images. The architecture incorporates a novel multi-scale detection head with a P2 layer to improve sensitivity to small objects often missed at coarser scales, and a GhostConv-based backbone to reduce computational complexity without sacrificing representational power. To enable evaluation, we manually annotated the CVIP360 dataset, generating 6,876 frame-level bounding boxes and producing a publicly available, detection-ready benchmark for 4K panoramic scenes. YOLO11-4K achieves 0.95 mAP at 0.50 IoU with 28.3 milliseconds inference per frame, representing a 75 percent latency reduction compared to YOLO11 (112.3 milliseconds), while also improving accuracy (mAP at 0.50 of 0.95 versus 0.908). This balance of efficiency and precision enables robust object detection in expansive 360-degree environments, making the framework suitable for real-world high-resolution panoramic applications. While this work focuses on 4K omnidirectional images, the approach is broadly applicable to high-resolution detection tasks in autonomous navigation, surveillance, and augmented reality.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this limitation, this study proposes a weakly supervised deep learning framework for pneumonia classification and localization using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM). Instead of relying on costly pixel-level annotations, the proposed method utilizes image-level labels to generate clinically meaningful heatmaps that highlight pneumonia-affected regions. Furthermore, we evaluate seven pre-trained deep learning models, including a Vision Transformer, under identical training conditions, using focal loss and patient-wise splits to prevent data leakage.

Federated graph learning (FGL) addresses this by enabling collaborative GNN model training without sharing private data. However, a core challenge in FGL systems is the variation in local training data distributions among clients, known as the data heterogeneity problem. Most existing solutions suffer from two problems: (1) The typical optimizer based on empirical risk minimization tends to cause local models to fall into sharp valleys and weakens their generalization to out-of-distribution graph data. (2) The prevalent dimensional collapse in the learned representations of local graph data has an adverse impact on the classification capacity of the GNN model. To this end, we formulate a novel optimization objective that is aware of the sharpness (i.e., the curvature of the loss surface) of local GNN models. By minimizing the loss function and its sharpness simultaneously, we seek out model parameters in a flat region with uniformly low loss values, thus improving the generalization over heterogeneous data. By introducing a regularizer based on the correlation matrix of local representations, we relax the correlations of representations generated by individual local graph samples, so as to alleviate the dimensional collapse of the learned model.

The 2D component of the final 3D human pose benefits from the detected 2D poses, whereas its depth counterpart must be estimated from scratch. The lifting-based methods encode the detected 2D pose and unknown depth in an entangled feature space, explicitly introducing depth uncertainty to the detected 2D pose, thereby limiting overall estimation accuracy. This work reveals that the depth representation is pivotal for the estimation process. Specifically, when depth is in an initial, completely unknown state, jointly encoding depth features with 2D pose features is detrimental to the estimation process. In contrast, when depth is initially refined to a more dependable state via network-based estimation, encoding it together with 2D pose information is beneficial. To address this limitation, we present a Mixture-of-Experts network for monocular 3D pose estimation named PoseMoE. Our approach introduces: (1) A mixture-of-experts network where specialized expert modules refine the well-detected 2D pose features and learn the depth features. This mixture-of-experts design disentangles the feature encoding process for 2D pose and depth, therefore reducing the explicit influence of uncertain depth features on 2D pose features. (2) A cross-expert knowledge aggregation module is proposed to aggregate cross-expert spatio-temporal contextual information. This step enhances features through bidirectional mapping between 2D pose and depth. Extensive experiments show that our proposed PoseMoE outperforms the conventional lifting-based methods on three widely used datasets: Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP, and 3DPW.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

VenusBench-GD contributes as follows: (i) we introduce a large-scale, cross-platform benchmark with extensive coverage of applications, diverse UI elements, and rich annotated data, (ii) we establish a high-quality data construction pipeline for grounding tasks, achieving higher annotation accuracy than existing benchmarks, and (iii) we extend the scope of element grounding by proposing a hierarchical task taxonomy that divides grounding into basic and advanced categories, encompassing six distinct subtasks designed to evaluate models from complementary perspectives.

Recent studies suggest that machine unlearning can help ensure deployed models comply with evolving legal, safety, and governance requirements. However, current unlearning techniques assume clean separation between forget and retain datasets, which is challenging in operational settings characterized by highly entangled distributions. In such scenarios, perturbation-based methods often degrade general model utility or fail to ensure safety. To address this, we propose Selective Representation Misdirection for Unlearning (SRMU), a novel principled activation-editing framework that enforces feature-aware and directionally controlled perturbations. Unlike indiscriminate model weights perturbations, SRMU employs a structured misdirection vector with an activation importance map. The goal is to allow SRMU selectively suppresses harmful representations while preserving the utility on benign ones. Experiments are conducted on the widely used WMDP benchmark across low- and high-entanglement configurations. Empirical results reveal that SRMU delivers state-of-the-art unlearning performance with minimal utility losses, and remains effective under 20-30\\% overlap where existing baselines collapse. SRMU provides a robust foundation for safety-driven model governance, privacy compliance, and controlled knowledge removal in the emerging LLM-based applications.

Previous training-time defenses rely on adversarial fine-tuning, which requires labeled data and costly retraining, while existing test-time strategies fail to reliably distinguish between clean and adversarial inputs, thereby preventing both adversarial robustness and clean accuracy from reaching their optimum. To address these limitations, we propose Test-Time Padding (TTP), a lightweight defense framework that performs adversarial detection followed by targeted adaptation at inference. TTP identifies adversarial inputs via the cosine similarity shift between CLIP feature embeddings computed before and after spatial padding, yielding a universal threshold for reliable detection across architectures and datasets. For detected adversarial cases, TTP employs trainable padding to restore disrupted attention patterns, coupled with a similarity-aware ensemble strategy for a more robust final prediction. For clean inputs, TTP leaves them unchanged by default or optionally integrates existing test-time adaptation techniques for further accuracy gains. Comprehensive experiments on diverse CLIP backbones and fine-grained benchmarks show that TTP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art test-time defenses, delivering substantial improvements in adversarial robustness without compromising clean accuracy.

To date, quantitative verification has been explored almost exclusively for deep neural networks (DNNs). Representative methods, such as DeepGemini and FairQuant, all build on the core idea of Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement, a generic framework that could be adapted to other model classes. We extended the framework into a model-agnostic form, but discovered two limitations: (i) it can provide only lower bounds, and (ii) its performance scales poorly. Exploiting the discrete structure of tree ensembles, our work proposes an efficient quantification technique that delivers any-time upper and lower bounds.

Using estimated dense 2D correspondences, we jointly infer the rigid motion of these primitives through an optimisation pipeline, yielding a 4D reconstruction of the scene, i.e. providing 3D geometry dynamically moving through time. To achieve this, we also introduce a mechanism to extrapolate motion for objects that become invisible, employing motion-grouping techniques to maintain continuity.\n  The resulting system enables 4D spatio-temporal awareness, offering capabilities such as replayable 3D reconstructions of articulated objects through time, multi-object scanning, and object permanence.

Kascade computes exact Top-k indices in a small set of anchor layers, then reuses those indices in intermediate reuse layers. The anchor layers are selected algorithmically, via a dynamic-programming objective that maximizes cross-layer similarity over a development set, allowing easy deployment across models. The method incorporates efficient implementation constraints (e.g. tile-level operations), across both prefill and decode attention. The Top-k selection and reuse in Kascade is head-aware and we show in our experiments that this is critical for high accuracy.

Most existing works either train lightweight adapters or refine intermediate features to achieve better generalization on unseen domains. However, they both overlook the fact that long-term pre-trained VFMs often exhibit artifacts, which hinder the utilization of valuable representations and ultimately degrade DGSS performance. Inspired by causal mechanisms, we observe that these artifacts are associated with non-causal factors, which usually reside in the low- and high-frequency components of the VFM spectrum. In this paper, we explicitly examine the causal and non-causal factors of features within VFMs for DGSS, and propose a simple yet effective method to identify and disentangle them, enabling more robust domain generalization. Specifically, we propose Causal-Tune, a novel fine-tuning strategy designed to extract causal factors and suppress non-causal ones from the features of VFMs. First, we extract the frequency spectrum of features from each layer using the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). A Gaussian band-pass filter is then applied to separate the spectrum into causal and non-causal components. To further refine the causal components, we introduce a set of causal-aware learnable tokens that operate in the frequency domain, while the non-causal components are discarded. Finally, refined features are transformed back into the spatial domain via inverse DCT and passed to the next layer. Extensive experiments conducted on various cross-domain tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of Causal-Tune. In particular, our method achieves superior performance under adverse weather conditions, improving +4.8% mIoU over the baseline in snow conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Unlike current works that take predefined external toolkits or generate images during thinking, however, humans can form flexible visual-text imagination and interactions during thinking without predefined toolkits, where one important reason is that humans construct the visual-text thinking process in a unified space inside the brain. Inspired by this capability, given that current MLLMs already encode visual and text information in the same feature space, we hold that visual tokens can be seamlessly inserted into the reasoning process carried by text tokens, where ideally, all visual imagination processes can be encoded by the latent features. To achieve this goal, we propose Sketch-in-Latents (SkiLa), a novel paradigm for unified multi-modal reasoning that expands the auto-regressive capabilities of MLLMs to natively generate continuous visual embeddings, termed latent sketch tokens, as visual thoughts. During multi-step reasoning, the model dynamically alternates between textual thinking mode for generating textual think tokens and visual sketching mode for generating latent sketch tokens.

The locality of the convolution operation in CNN may limit the model's ability to understand long-range semantic information. To address this issue, we propose Yuan-TecSwin, a text-conditioned diffusion model with Swin-transformer in this work. The Swin-transformer blocks take the place of CNN blocks in the encoder and decoder, to improve the non-local modeling ability in feature extraction and image restoration. The text-image alignment is improved with a well-chosen text encoder, effective utilization of text embedding, and careful design in the incorporation of text condition. Using an adapted time step to search in different diffusion stages, inference performance is further improved by 10%. Yuan-TecSwin achieves the state-of-the-art FID score of 1.37 on ImageNet generation benchmark, without any additional models at different denoising stages. In a side-by-side comparison, we find it difficult for human interviewees to tell the model-generated images from the human-painted ones.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, the lack of effective evaluation methodologies has made it difficult to estimate the risk of bias, making deployment of such systems unsafe in high stakes domains such as consumer finance, where biased decisions can translate directly into regulatory breaches and financial loss. To address this challenge, we need to develop fairness evaluation methodologies for multi-agent predictive systems and measure the fairness characteristics of these systems in the financial tabular domain. Examining fairness metrics using large-scale simulations across diverse multi-agent configurations, with varying communication and collaboration mechanisms, we reveal patterns of emergent bias in financial decision-making that cannot be traced to individual agent components, indicating that multi-agent systems may exhibit genuinely collective behaviors. Our findings highlight that fairness risks in financial multi-agent systems represent a significant component of model risk, with tangible impacts on tasks such as credit scoring and income estimation. We advocate that multi-agent decision systems must be evaluated as holistic entities rather than through reductionist analyses of their constituent components.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u91d1\u878d\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u62df\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6574\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u91d1\u878d\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u6d88\u8d39\u91d1\u878d\uff09\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u76d1\u7ba1\u8fdd\u89c4\u548c\u8d22\u52a1\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9884\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u4e0d\u540c\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u914d\u7f6e\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\uff09\u4e0b\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u91d1\u878d\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u65e0\u6cd5\u8ffd\u6eaf\u5230\u5355\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u504f\u89c1\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u96c6\u4f53\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u662f\u91d1\u878d\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5bf9\u4fe1\u7528\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u6536\u5165\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u5fc5\u987b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6574\u4f53\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6784\u6210\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u8fd8\u539f\u4e3b\u4e49\u5206\u6790\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

Recent Top-K sparse attention approaches reduce the computation of DiTs by compressing tokens into block-wise representation and selecting a small set of relevant key blocks, but still suffer from (i) quadratic selection cost on compressed tokens and (ii) increasing K required to maintain model quality as sequences grow. We identify that their inefficiency is due to the single-level design, as a single coarse level is insufficient to represent the global structure. In this paper, we introduce Log-linear Sparse Attention (LLSA), a trainable sparse attention mechanism for extremely long token sequences that reduces both selection and attention costs from quadratic to log-linear complexity by utilizing a hierarchical structure. LLSA performs hierarchical Top-K selection, progressively adopting sparse Top-K selection with the indices found at the previous level, and introduces a Hierarchical KV Enrichment mechanism that preserves global context while using fewer tokens of different granularity during attention computation. To support efficient training, we develop a high-performance GPU implementation that uses only sparse indices for both the forward and backward passes, eliminating the need for dense attention masks. We evaluate LLSA on high-resolution pixel-space image generation without using patchification and VAE encoding. LLSA accelerates attention inference by 28.27x and DiT training by 6.09x on 256x256 pixel token sequences, while maintaining generation quality. The results demonstrate that LLSA offers a promising direction for training long-sequence DiTs efficiently.

Our experiments show that, while GA, ES, PABBO, and SABBO eventually reach a similar band of final perplexity, the amortized optimizers are substantially more sample- and time-efficient.

One such application, indoor multimedia geolocation, has the potential to become a crucial aid for law enforcement in the fight against human trafficking, child exploitation, and other serious crimes. While outdoor multimedia geolocation has been widely explored, its indoor counterpart remains underdeveloped due to challenges such as similar room layouts, frequent renovations, visual ambiguity, indoor lighting variability, unreliable GPS signals, and limited datasets in sensitive domains. This paper introduces a pipeline that uses electric sockets as consistent indoor markers for geolocation, since plug socket types are standardised by country or region. The three-stage deep learning pipeline detects plug sockets (YOLOv11, mAP@0.5 = 0.843), classifies them into one of 12 plug socket types (Xception, accuracy = 0.912), and maps the detected socket types to countries (accuracy = 0.96 at >90% threshold confidence). To address data scarcity, two dedicated datasets were created: socket detection dataset of 2,328 annotated images expanded to 4,072 through augmentation, and a classification dataset of 3,187 images across 12 plug socket classes. The pipeline was evaluated on the Hotels-50K dataset, focusing on the TraffickCam subset of crowd-sourced hotel images, which capture real-world conditions such as poor lighting and amateur angles. This dataset provides a more realistic evaluation than using professional, well-lit, often wide-angle images from travel websites. This framework demonstrates a practical step toward real-world digital forensic applications.

While prior work has explored input perturbations to protect against misuse in personalized text-to-image generation, the robustness of modern, large-scale in-context DiT-based models remains largely unexamined. In this paper, we propose DeContext, a new method to safeguard input images from unauthorized in-context editing. Our key insight is that contextual information from the source image propagates to the output primarily through multimodal attention layers. By injecting small, targeted perturbations that weaken these cross-attention pathways, DeContext breaks this flow, effectively decouples the link between input and output. This simple defense is both efficient and robust. We further show that early denoising steps and specific transformer blocks dominate context propagation, which allows us to concentrate perturbations where they matter most. Experiments on Flux Kontext and Step1X-Edit show that DeContext consistently blocks unwanted image edits while preserving visual quality.

However, existing SAR-oriented deep learning is constrained by data scarcity, while the physically grounded speckle noise in SAR imagery further hampers fine-grained semantic representation learning. To address these challenges, we propose SARMAE, a Noise-Aware Masked Autoencoder for self-supervised SAR representation learning. Specifically, we construct SAR-1M, the first million-scale SAR dataset, with additional paired optical images, to enable large-scale pre-training. Building upon this, we design Speckle-Aware Representation Enhancement (SARE), which injects SAR-specific speckle noise into masked autoencoders to facilitate noise-aware and robust representation learning.

Detecting clusters in exploratory data analyses (EDA) requires algorithms that make few assumptions about the data. Density-based clustering algorithms are particularly well-suited for EDA because they describe high-density regions, assuming only that a density exists. Applying density-based clustering algorithms in practice, however, requires selecting appropriate hyperparameters, which is difficult without prior knowledge of the data distribution. For example, DBSCAN requires selecting a density threshold, and HDBSCAN* relies on a minimum cluster size parameter. In this work, we propose Persistent Leaves Spatial Clustering for Applications with Noise (PLSCAN). This novel density-based clustering algorithm efficiently identifies all minimum cluster sizes for which HDBSCAN* produces stable (leaf) clusters. PLSCAN applies scale-space clustering principles and is equivalent to persistent homology on a novel metric space. We compare its performance to HDBSCAN* on several real-world datasets, demonstrating that it achieves a higher average ARI and is less sensitive to changes in the number of mutual reachability neighbours. Additionally, we compare PLSCAN's computational costs to k-Means, demonstrating competitive run-times on low-dimensional datasets.

Recent works inject semantics from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) either externally via representation alignment or internally by jointly modeling only a narrow slice of VFM features inside the diffusion process, under-utilizing the rich, nonlinear, multi-layer spatial semantics available. We introduce REGLUE (Representation Entanglement with Global-Local Unified Encoding), a unified latent diffusion framework that jointly models (i) VAE image latents, (ii) compact local (patch-level) VFM semantics, and (iii) a global (image-level) [CLS] token within a single SiT backbone. A lightweight convolutional semantic compressor nonlinearly aggregates multi-layer VFM features into a low-dimensional, spatially structured representation, which is entangled with the VAE latents in the diffusion process. An external alignment loss further regularizes internal representations toward frozen VFM targets. On ImageNet 256x256, REGLUE consistently improves FID and accelerates convergence over SiT-B/2 and SiT-XL/2 baselines, as well as over REPA, ReDi, and REG. Extensive experiments show that (a) spatial VFM semantics are crucial, (b) non-linear compression is key to unlocking their full benefit, and (c) global tokens and external alignment act as complementary, lightweight enhancements within our global-local-latent joint modeling framework.

Meanwhile, current sequential models extract direct sequential signal, missing useful event-counting statistics. We enhance deep sequential models with self-supervised pretraining strategies for display advertising. Especially, we introduce Abacus, a novel approach of predicting the empirical frequency distribution of user events. We further propose a hybrid objective unifying Abacus with sequential learning objectives, combining stability of aggregated statistics with the sequence modeling sensitivity.

While recent diffusion-based approaches show promise for G-buffer-conditioned image synthesis, they face critical limitations: single-image models like RGBX generate frames independently without temporal consistency, while video models like DiffusionRenderer are too computationally expensive for most consumer gaming sets ups and require complete sequences upfront, making them unsuitable for interactive applications where future frames depend on user input. We introduce FrameDiffuser, an autoregressive neural rendering framework that generates temporally consistent, photorealistic frames by conditioning on G-buffer data and the models own previous output. After an initial frame, FrameDiffuser operates purely on incoming G-buffer data, comprising geometry, materials, and surface properties, while using its previously generated frame for temporal guidance, maintaining stable, temporal consistent generation over hundreds to thousands of frames. Our dual-conditioning architecture combines ControlNet for structural guidance with ControlLoRA for temporal coherence. A three-stage training strategy enables stable autoregressive generation. We specialize our model to individual environments, prioritizing consistency and inference speed over broad generalization, demonstrating that environment-specific training achieves superior photorealistic quality with accurate lighting, shadows, and reflections compared to generalized approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "FrameDiffuser\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u795e\u7ecf\u6e32\u67d3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408G-buffer\u8f93\u5165\u548c\u5148\u524d\u751f\u6210\u5e27\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u903c\u771f\u6e32\u67d3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684G-buffer\u6761\u4ef6\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff1a\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u524d\u83b7\u53d6\u5b8c\u6574\u5e8f\u5217\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u6761\u4ef6\u67b6\u6784\uff08ControlNet\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed3\u6784\u6307\u5bfc\uff0cControlLoRA\u786e\u4fdd\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\u548c\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u73af\u5883\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "FrameDiffuser\u5728\u6570\u767e\u81f3\u6570\u5343\u5e27\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u5149\u7167\u3001\u9634\u5f71\u548c\u53cd\u5c04\u65b9\u9762\u6bd4\u901a\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u903c\u771f\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u73af\u5883\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6846\u67b6\uff0cFrameDiffuser\u4e3a\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u795e\u7ecf\u6e32\u67d3\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, practical deployment of deep learning-based RFFI models is hindered by a critical challenge: their performance often degrades significantly when applied across receivers with different hardware characteristics due to distribution shifts introduced by receiver variation. To address this, we investigate the source-data-free cross-receiver RFFI (SCRFFI) problem, where a model pretrained on labeled signals from a source receiver must adapt to unlabeled signals from a target receiver, without access to any source-domain data during adaptation. We first formulate a novel constrained pseudo-labeling-based SCRFFI adaptation framework, and provide a theoretical analysis of its generalization performance. Our analysis highlights a key insight: the target-domain performance is highly sensitive to the quality of the pseudo-labels generated during adaptation. Motivated by this, we propose Momentum Soft pseudo-label Source Hypothesis Transfer (MS-SHOT), a new method for SCRFFI that incorporates momentum-center-guided soft pseudo-labeling and enforces global structural constraints to encourage confident and diverse predictions. Notably, MS-SHOT effectively addresses scenarios involving label shift or unknown, non-uniform class distributions in the target domain -- a significant limitation of prior methods. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MS-SHOT consistently outperforms existing approaches in both accuracy and robustness, offering a practical and scalable solution for source-data-free cross-receiver adaptation in RFFI.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u8de8\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u5c04\u9891\u6307\u7eb9\u8bc6\u522b\uff08SCRFFI\uff09\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684MS-SHOT\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u5f53\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u4e00\u4e2a\u6e90\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u65f6\uff0c\u56e0\u786c\u4ef6\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8fb9\u7f18\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5c04\u9891\u6307\u7eb9\u8bc6\u522b\u5728\u8bbe\u5907\u5b89\u5168\u8ba4\u8bc1\u4e2d\u53d8\u5f97\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u5f53\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u786c\u4ef6\u7279\u6027\u7684\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u786c\u4ef6\u5dee\u5f02\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u504f\u79fb\u6216\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u975e\u5747\u5300\u7c7b\u5206\u5e03\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u9996\u5148\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ea6\u675f\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7684SCRFFI\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u5176\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MS-SHOT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u52a8\u91cf\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8f6f\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\u6765\u9f13\u52b1\u81ea\u4fe1\u4e14\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMS-SHOT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u504f\u79fb\u6216\u672a\u77e5\u7684\u975e\u5747\u5300\u7c7b\u5206\u5e03\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "conclusion": "MS-SHOT\u4e3a\u5c04\u9891\u6307\u7eb9\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u6e90\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u5173\u8de8\u63a5\u6536\u5668\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u786c\u4ef6\u5dee\u5f02\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Splatting-based methods such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) provide faster rendering by rasterizing 3D primitives. RadiantFoam (RF) brought ray tracing back, achieving throughput comparable to Gaussian Splatting by organizing radiance with an explicit Voronoi Diagram (VD). Yet, all the mentioned methods still struggle with precise mesh reconstruction. We address this gap by jointly learning an explicit VD with an implicit Signed Distance Field (SDF). The scene is optimized via ray tracing and regularized by an Eikonal objective. The SDF introduces metric-consistent isosurfaces, which, in turn, bias near-surface Voronoi cell faces to align with the zero level set. The resulting model produces crisper, view-consistent surfaces with fewer floaters and improved topology, while preserving photometric quality and maintaining training speed on par with RadiantFoam.

It has several application domains in market analysis, customer recommendation, and recommendation systems. This study presents a comparative analysis of the widely used machine learning algorithms, namely Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), AdaBoost, XGBoost, and an SVM variant (SVM_R) with neuro-symbolic AI (NeSy). The paper also explores the effect of text representations such as TF-IDF, the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE), and RoBERTa. Additionally, various feature extraction techniques, including Chi-Square, Mutual Information, and Principal Component Analysis, are explored. Building on these, we introduce a comparative analysis of the machine learning and deep learning approaches in comparison to the NeSy. The experimental results show that the use of the NeSy approach matched strong MLP results despite a limited dataset. Future work on this research will expand the knowledge base, the scope of embedding types, and the hyperparameter configuration to further study the effectiveness of the NeSy approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Manual landmarking is time-consuming, operator-dependent, and sensitive to variability across scanners and sites, limiting the reproducibility of automated approaches. There is a need for multi-source annotated datasets to develop artificial intelligence-assisted fetal growth assessment methods. To address this bottleneck, we present an open, multi-centre, multi-device benchmark dataset of fetal US images with expert anatomical landmark annotations for clinically used fetal biometric measurements. These measurements include head bi-parietal and occipito-frontal diameters, abdominal transverse and antero-posterior diameters, and femoral length. The dataset contains 4,513 de-identified US images from 1,904 subjects acquired at three clinical sites using seven different US devices. We provide standardised, subject-disjoint train/test splits, evaluation code, and baseline results to enable fair and reproducible comparison of methods. Using an automatic biometry model, we quantify domain shift and demonstrate that training and evaluation confined to a single centre substantially overestimate performance relative to multi-centre testing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available multi-centre, multi-device, landmark-annotated dataset that covers all primary fetal biometry measures, providing a robust benchmark for domain adaptation and multi-centre generalisation in fetal biometry and enabling more reliable AI-assisted fetal growth assessment across centres.

These tasks demand different levels of annotation granularity but are frequently constrained by the scarcity of region-level (dense) annotations. We introduce CLARiTy (Class Localizing and Attention Refining Image Transformer), a vision transformer-based model for joint multi-label classification and weakly-supervised localization of thoracic pathologies. CLARiTy employs multiple class-specific tokens to generate discriminative attention maps, and a SegmentCAM module for foreground segmentation and background suppression using explicit anatomical priors. Trained on image-level labels from the NIH ChestX-ray14 dataset, it leverages distillation from a ConvNeXtV2 teacher for efficiency. Evaluated on the official NIH split, the CLARiTy-S-16-512 (a configuration of CLARiTy), achieves competitive classification performance across 14 pathologies, and state-of-the-art weakly-supervised localization performance on 8 pathologies, outperforming prior methods by 50.7%. In particular, pronounced gains occur for small pathologies like nodules and masses. The lower-resolution variant of CLARiTy, CLARiTy-S-16-224, offers high efficiency while decisively surpassing baselines, thereby having the potential for use in low-resource settings. An ablation study confirms contributions of SegmentCAM, DINO pretraining, orthogonal class token loss, and attention pooling.

Micro gestures involve subtle motion patterns, which make constructing datasets with precise skeletons and frame-level annotations difficult. To this end, we develop a multi-view self-supervised pipeline to automatically generate skeleton data, complemented by heuristic rules and expert refinement for semi-automatic annotation. Based on this pipeline, we introduce OMG-Bench, the first large-scale public benchmark for skeleton-based online micro gesture recognition. It features 40 fine-grained gesture classes with 13,948 instances across 1,272 sequences, characterized by subtle motions, rapid dynamics, and continuous execution. To tackle these challenges, we propose Hierarchical Memory-Augmented Transformer (HMATr), an end-to-end framework that unifies gesture detection and classification by leveraging hierarchical memory banks which store frame-level details and window-level semantics to preserve historical context. In addition, it employs learnable position-aware queries initialized from the memory to implicitly encode gesture positions and semantics. Experiments show that HMATr outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.6\\% in detection rate, establishing a strong baseline for online micro gesture recognition.

Built upon the powerful DiT-based generative foundation model, we systematically evaluate different control schemes, showing that a text-image-mask joint attention scheme combined with full fine-tuning of the image and mask branches significantly enhances the effectiveness of RS semantic segmentation data synthesis, particularly in few-shot and complex-scene scenarios.

However, existing methods like auto-rigging and pose-conditioned generation often struggle with challenges such as inaccurate skinning weight prediction, topological imperfections, and poor pose conformance, limiting their robustness and generalizability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Make-It-Poseable, a novel feed-forward framework that reformulates character posing as a latent-space transformation problem. Instead of deforming mesh vertices as in traditional pipelines, our method reconstructs the character in new poses by directly manipulating its latent representation. At the core of our method is a latent posing transformer that manipulates shape tokens based on skeletal motion. This process is facilitated by a dense pose representation for precise control.

Bridges", "Simon Hadfield"], "title": "FlowDet: Unifying Object Detection and Generative Transport Flows", "comment": null, "summary": "We present FlowDet, the first formulation of object detection using modern Conditional Flow Matching techniques. This work follows from DiffusionDet, which originally framed detection as a generative denoising problem in the bounding box space via diffusion. We revisit and generalise this formulation to a broader class of generative transport problems, while maintaining the ability to vary the number of boxes and inference steps without re-training. In contrast to the curved stochastic transport paths induced by diffusion, FlowDet learns simpler and straighter paths resulting in faster scaling of detection performance as the number of inference steps grows. We find that this reformulation enables us to outperform diffusion based detection systems (as well as non-generative baselines) across a wide range of experiments, including various precision/recall operating points using multiple feature backbones and datasets. In particular, when evaluating under recall-constrained settings, we can highlight the effects of the generative transport without over-compensating with large numbers of proposals.

These fraudulent applications not only inflict financial losses but also pose severe privacy risks by harvesting sensitive personal data. This research aims to address this critical issue by implementing and evaluating machine learning algorithms to verify application authenticity automatically. Using a comprehensive dataset comprising both official applications registered with the Ministry of Religious Affairs and unofficial applications circulating on app stores, we compare the performance of three robust classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Na\"ive Bayes (NB). The study utilizes a hybrid feature extraction methodology that combines Textual Analysis (TF-IDF) of application descriptions with Metadata Analysis of sensitive access permissions. The experimental results indicate that the SVM algorithm achieves the highest performance with an accuracy of 92.3%, a precision of 91.5%, and an F1-score of 92.0%. Detailed feature analysis reveals that specific keywords related to legality and high-risk permissions (e.g., READ PHONE STATE) are the most significant discriminators.

Unlike disjointed pipeline approaches, Kling-Omni supports a diverse range of user inputs, including text instructions, reference images, and video contexts, processing them into a unified multimodal representation to deliver cinematic-quality and highly-intelligent video content creation. To support these capabilities, we constructed a comprehensive data system that serves as the foundation for multimodal video creation.

Existing real datasets fit real-world scenarios, capturing authentic road object behaviors, however, they typically lack precise ground-truth annotations. In contrast, synthetic datasets play a crucial role, allowing for the annotation of a large number of frames without additional costs or extra time. However, a general drawback of synthetic datasets is the lack of realistic vehicle motion, since trajectories are generated using AI models or rule-based systems. In this work, we introduce R3ST (Realistic 3D Synthetic Trajectories), a synthetic dataset that overcomes this limitation by generating a synthetic 3D environment and integrating real-world trajectories derived from SinD, a bird's-eye-view dataset recorded from drone footage. The proposed dataset closes the gap between synthetic data and realistic trajectories, advancing the research in trajectory forecasting of road vehicles, offering both accurate multimodal ground-truth annotations and authentic human-driven vehicle trajectories.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Advances in information technology have enabled data-driven approaches to studying such systems.

We validate our approach using data from numerical simulations of biological and physical systems on flat and curved domains. Our results show that the proposed metrics, combined with multidimensional scaling, effectively address key analytical challenges.

However, it is challenging to reconstruct realistic and diverse full-body poses based on sparse signals obtained by head-mounted displays, which are the main devices in AR/VR scenarios. Existing methods for pose reconstruction often incur high computational costs or rely on separately modeling spatial and temporal dependencies, making it difficult to balance accuracy, temporal coherence, and efficiency. To address this problem, we propose KineST, a novel kinematics-guided state space model, which effectively extracts spatiotemporal dependencies while integrating local and global pose perception. The innovation comes from two core ideas. Firstly, in order to better capture intricate joint relationships, the scanning strategy within the State Space Duality framework is reformulated into kinematics-guided bidirectional scanning, which embeds kinematic priors. Secondly, a mixed spatiotemporal representation learning approach is employed to tightly couple spatial and temporal contexts, balancing accuracy and smoothness. Additionally, a geometric angular velocity loss is introduced to impose physically meaningful constraints on rotational variations for further improving motion stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KineST has superior performance in both accuracy and temporal consistency within a lightweight framework.

Prefix caching partially alleviates some of these costs by reusing KV cache for previously processed tokens, but limited by strict prefix matching. Position-independent caching (PIC) enables chunk-level reuse at arbitrary positions, but requires selective recomputation and positional-encoding (PE) adjustments. However, because these operations vary across queries, KV for the same chunk diverges across requests. Moreover, without page alignment, chunk KV layouts diverge in memory, preventing page sharing. These issues result in only modest HBM savings even when many requests reuse the same content.\n  We present MEPIC, a memory-efficient PIC system that enables chunk KV reuse across positions, requests, and batches. MEPIC aligns chunk KV to paged storage, shifts recomputation from token- to block-level so only the first block is request-specific, removes positional encodings via Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) fusion in the attention kernel, and makes remaining blocks fully shareable. These techniques eliminate most duplicate chunk KV in HBM, reducing usage by up to 2x over state-of-the-art PIC at comparable latency and accuracy, and up to 5x for long prompts, without any model changes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

TRC applies compact networks (approximately 1.5M parameters) repeatedly through a two-level hierarchical latent structure, refining control sequences by simulating trajectories and correcting based on tracking error. Because the same weights process every refinement step, adding iterations increases computation without increasing memory. We evaluate TRC on nonlinear control problems including oscillator stabilization and powered descent with fuel constraints. Across these domains, TRC achieves near-optimal control costs while requiring only millisecond-scale inference on GPU and under 10~MB memory, two orders of magnitude smaller than language model baselines.

LaMer consists of two key components: (i) a cross-episode training framework to encourage exploration and long-term rewards optimization; and (ii) in-context policy adaptation via reflection, allowing the agent to adapt their policy from task feedback signal without gradient update. Experiments across diverse environments show that LaMer significantly improves performance over RL baselines, with 11%, 14%, and 19% performance gains on Sokoban, MineSweeper and Webshop, respectively.

To address this, Online Edge ML allows models to be trained directly on edge devices and updated continuously with new data. This paper explores a key challenge of Online Edge ML: \"How to determine labels for truly future, unseen data points\". We propose Knowledge Transformation (KT), a hybrid method combining Knowledge Distillation, Active Learning, and causal reasoning. In short, KT acts as the oracle in active learning by transforming knowledge from a teacher model to generate pseudo-labels for training a student model. To verify the validity of the method, we conducted simulation experiments with two setups: (1) using a less stable teacher model and (2) a relatively more stable teacher model. Results indicate that when a stable teacher model is given, the student model can eventually reach its expected maximum performance. KT is potentially beneficial for scenarios that meet the following circumstances: (1) when the teacher's task is generic, which means existing pre-trained models might be adequate for its task, so there will be no need to train the teacher model from scratch; and/or (2) when the label for the student's task is difficult or expensive to acquire.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u6362\uff08KT\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u7ebf\u8fb9\u7f18\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u672a\u6765\u672a\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u3001\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u5728\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u9884\u671f\u6700\u5927\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf\u8fb9\u7f18\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5141\u8bb8\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5047\u8bbe\u9759\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u65e0\u6548\u3002\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u4e3a\u771f\u6b63\u672a\u6765\u7684\u672a\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u786e\u5b9a\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u6362\uff08KT\uff09\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u3001\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u8ba9\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5145\u5f53\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u6362\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e24\u79cd\u5bf9\u6bd4\u573a\u666f\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u592a\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u7ec8\u80fd\u591f\u8fbe\u5230\u5176\u9884\u671f\u7684\u6700\u5927\u6027\u80fd\u3002KT\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6559\u5e08\u4efb\u52a1\u901a\u7528\uff08\u73b0\u6709\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u8db3\u591f\uff09\u548c\u5b66\u751f\u4efb\u52a1\u6807\u7b7e\u96be\u4ee5\u83b7\u53d6\u6216\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u6362\uff08KT\uff09\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u8fb9\u7f18\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u672a\u6765\u672a\u89c1\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u6807\u7b7e\u83b7\u53d6\u56f0\u96be\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This ability, known as Continual learning, provides a foundation for AI systems to develop themselves adaptively. Catastrophic forgetting is a major challenge to the progress of Continual Learning approaches, where learning a new task usually results in a dramatic performance drop on previously learned ones. Many approaches have emerged to counteract the impact of CF. Most of the proposed approaches can be categorized into five classes: replay-based, regularization-based, optimization-based, representation-based, and architecture-based. In this work, we approach the problem from a different angle, specifically by considering the optimal sequencing of tasks as they are presented to the model. We investigate the role of task sequencing in mitigating CF and propose a method for determining the optimal task order. The proposed method leverages zero-shot scoring algorithms inspired by neural architecture search (NAS). Results demonstrate that intelligent task sequencing can substantially reduce CF. Moreover, when combined with traditional continual learning strategies, sequencing offers enhanced performance and robustness against forgetting.

These models, trained on extant data from various sources, can be conceptualized as historical artifacts that encode decades-old attitudes and stereotypes. This paper investigates one such example trained on the broadly-used New York Times Annotated Corpus to create a multi-label classifier. Our use in research settings surfaced the concerning \"blacks\" thematic topic label. Through quantitative and qualitative means we investigate this label's use in the training corpus, what concepts it might be encoding in the trained classifier, and how those concepts impact our model use. Via the application of explainable AI methods, we find that the \"blacks\" label operates partially as a general \"racism detector\" across some minoritized groups. However, it performs poorly against expectations on modern examples such as COVID-19 era anti-Asian hate stories, and reporting on the Black Lives Matter movement. This case study of interrogating embedded biases in a model reveals how similar applications in newsroom settings can lead to unexpected outputs that could impact a wide variety of potential uses of any large language model-story discovery, audience targeting, summarization, etc. The fundamental tension this exposes for newsrooms is how to adopt AI-enabled workflow tools while reducing the risk of reproducing historical biases in news coverage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u4e8e\u300a\u7ebd\u7ea6\u65f6\u62a5\u300b\u8bed\u6599\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e2d'blacks'\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86AI\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u7f16\u7801\u5386\u53f2\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5728\u65b0\u95fb\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740AI\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u5165\u65b0\u95fb\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u65b0\u95fb\u7f16\u8f91\u5ba4\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u57fa\u4e8e\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u7f16\u7801\u8fc7\u53bb\u7684\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8c03\u67e5\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u4f53\u6848\u4f8b\u2014\u2014\u57fa\u4e8e\u300a\u7ebd\u7ea6\u65f6\u62a5\u300b\u6807\u6ce8\u8bed\u6599\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4e2d'blacks'\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u548c\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86'blacks'\u6807\u7b7e\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\u4e2d\u7684\u4f7f\u7528\u60c5\u51b5\u3001\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0'blacks'\u6807\u7b7e\u5728\u4e00\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5145\u5f53\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u67d0\u4e9b\u5c11\u6570\u7fa4\u4f53\u7684'\u79cd\u65cf\u4e3b\u4e49\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668'\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5904\u7406\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bae\u9898\uff08\u5982COVID-19\u671f\u95f4\u53cd\u4e9a\u88d4\u4ec7\u6068\u62a5\u9053\u3001\u9ed1\u547d\u8d35\u8fd0\u52a8\u62a5\u9053\uff09\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86AI\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u504f\u89c1\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u81f4\u610f\u5916\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u65b0\u95fb\u62a5\u9053\u7684\u591a\u79cd\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff08\u6545\u4e8b\u53d1\u73b0\u3001\u53d7\u4f17\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u6458\u8981\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u95fb\u7f16\u8f91\u5ba4\u91c7\u7528AI\u5de5\u5177\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u77db\u76fe\uff1a\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u5229\u7528AI\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u5386\u53f2\u504f\u89c1\u5728\u65b0\u95fb\u62a5\u9053\u4e2d\u7684\u518d\u73b0\u3002"}}

This finetuning step has proved critical in achieving human or super-human performance, yet while much attention has been given to developing more effective finetuning algorithms, little attention has been given to ensuring the pretrained policy is an effective initialization for RL finetuning. In this work we seek to understand how the pretrained policy affects finetuning performance, and how to pretrain policies in order to ensure they are effective initializations for finetuning. We first show theoretically that standard behavioral cloning (BC) -- which trains a policy to directly match the actions played by the demonstrator -- can fail to ensure coverage over the demonstrator's actions, a minimal condition necessary for effective RL finetuning. We then show that if, instead of exactly fitting the observed demonstrations, we train a policy to model the posterior distribution of the demonstrator's behavior given the demonstration dataset, we do obtain a policy that ensures coverage over the demonstrator's actions, enabling more effective finetuning. Furthermore, this policy -- which we refer to as the posterior behavioral cloning (PostBC) policy -- achieves this while ensuring pretrained performance is no worse than that of the BC policy. We then show that PostBC is practically implementable with modern generative models in robotic control domains -- relying only on standard supervised learning -- and leads to significantly improved RL finetuning performance on both realistic robotic control benchmarks and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, as compared to standard behavioral cloning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u540e\u9a8c\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\uff08PostBC\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u6f14\u793a\u8005\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u540e\u7eed\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u8f83\u4f20\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3-\u5fae\u8c03\u8303\u5f0f\u5b58\u5728\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u8986\u76d6\u6f14\u793a\u8005\u7684\u6240\u6709\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u5fae\u8c03\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u540e\u9a8c\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\uff08PostBC\uff09\uff1a\u4e0d\u76f4\u63a5\u62df\u5408\u6f14\u793a\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5efa\u6a21\u7ed9\u5b9a\u6f14\u793a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u540e\u6f14\u793a\u8005\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9700\u6807\u51c6\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u517c\u5bb9\u3002", "result": "PostBC\u786e\u4fdd\u5bf9\u6f14\u793a\u8005\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfBC\u3002\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cPostBC\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684RL\u5fae\u8c03\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfBC\u3002", "conclusion": "PostBC\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e2\u4fdd\u6301\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u80fd\u53c8\u6539\u5584\u5fae\u8c03\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u9700\u8981\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3-\u5fae\u8c03\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u9886\u57df\u3002"}}

Recent studies suggest that RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two seemingly paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards, which suppress exploitation by rewarding outcomes unrelated to the ground truth, and entropy minimization, which suppresses exploration by pushing the model toward more confident and deterministic outputs, highlighting a puzzling dynamic: both discouraging exploitation and discouraging exploration improve reasoning performance, yet the underlying principles that reconcile these effects remain poorly understood. We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. We further propose a reward-misalignment model explaining why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings. Our findings clarify the mechanisms behind spurious-reward benefits and provide principles for more effective RLVR training.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
