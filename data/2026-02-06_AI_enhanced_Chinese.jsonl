Infertility, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular risks are long-term complications that make early detection essential. In this paper, we design a powerful framework based on transfer learning utilizing DenseNet201 and ResNet50 for classifying ovarian ultrasound images. The model was trained on an online dataset containing 3856 ultrasound images of cyst-infected and non-infected patients. Each ultrasound frame was resized to 224x224 pixels and encoded with precise pathological indicators. The MixUp and CutMix augmentation strategies were used to improve generalization, yielding a peak validation accuracy of 99.80% by Densenet201 and a validation loss of 0.617 with alpha values of 0.25 and 0.4, respectively. We evaluated the model's interpretability using leading Explainable AI (XAI) approaches such as SHAP, Grad-CAM, and LIME, reasoning with and presenting explicit visual reasons for the model's behaviors, therefore increasing the model's transparency. This study proposes an automated system for medical picture diagnosis that may be used effectively and confidently in clinical practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, deploying adaptive controllers to implement such dynamic scaling in operational networks is challenging due to the risk of breaching service agreements and operational constraints. To mitigate this challenge, we present a novel method for learning the safe operating region of the RAN, i.e., the set of resource allocations and network configurations for which its specification is fulfilled. The method, which we call (C)ausal (O)nline (L)earning, operates in two online phases: an inference phase and an intervention phase. In the first phase, we passively observe the RAN to infer an initial safe region via causal inference and Gaussian process regression. In the second phase, we gradually expand this region through interventional Bayesian learning. We prove that COL ensures that the learned region is safe with a specified probability and that it converges to the full safe region under standard conditions. We experimentally validate COL on a 5G testbed. The results show that COL quickly learns the safe region while incurring low operational cost and being up to 10x more sample-efficient than current state-of-the-art methods for safe learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included a series of 0.35T MR-Linac images from 761 patients. An artificial intelligence (deep learning) model was used to characterize treatment-induced changes by predicting the temporal order of paired images. The model was first trained with the images from the first and the last fractions (F1-FL), then with all pairs (All-pairs). Model performance was assessed using quantitative metrics (accuracy and AUC), compared to a radiologist's performance, and qualitative analyses - the saliency map evaluation to investigate affected anatomical regions. Input ablation experiments were performed to identify the anatomical regions altered by radiotherapy. The radiologist conducted an additional task on partial images reconstructed by saliency map regions, reporting observations as well. Quantitative image analysis was conducted to investigate the results from the model and the radiologist. Results: The F1-FL model yielded near-perfect performance (AUC of 0.99), significantly outperforming the radiologist. The All-pairs model yielded an AUC of 0.97. This performance reflects therapy-induced changes, supported by the performance correlation to fraction intervals, ablation tests and expert's interpretation. Primary regions driving the predictions were prostate, bladder, and pubic symphysis. Conclusion: The model accurately predicts temporal order of MR-Linac fractions and detects radiation-induced changes over one or a few days, including prostate and adjacent organ alterations confirmed by experts. This underscores MR-Linac's potential for advanced image analysis beyond image guidance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, unsynchronized transmitters and receivers fundamentally preclude phase-coherent radar-like delay--Doppler analysis. By exploiting the line-of-sight (LoS) path, i.e., the earliest-arriving direct path, as an over-the-air (OTA) reference for delay and phase, we propose an OTA LoS-path referencing scheme, termed LoSRef, that enables delay calibration and phase alignment in unsynchronized Wi-Fi systems. Unlike conventional Wi-Fi bistatic radar systems that rely on wired reference signals or dedicated reference antennas, the proposed LoSRef-based framework bridges the long-standing gap between conventional Wi-Fi sensing and Wi-Fi radar, enabling phase-coherent bistatic radar-like operation in a drop-in Wi-Fi sensing configuration. Through human gait and respiration experiments in indoor environments, we demonstrate that phase-coherent channel impulse responses and corresponding delay--Doppler responses are obtained using only commodity Wi-Fi devices.

We hypothesize that a deep learning model with a similar approach to TractSeg will improve similarity between an algorithm-generated mask and an expert-labeled ground truth. Given a cohort of 56 manually labelled white matter bundles, we take inspiration from TractSeg's 2D UNet architecture, and we modify inputs to match bundle definitions as determined by pediatric experts, evaluation to use k fold cross validation, the loss function to masked Dice loss. We evaluate Dice score, volume overlap, and volume overreach of 16 major regions of interest compared to the expert labeled dataset. To test whether our approach offers statistically significant improvements over TractSeg, we compare Dice voxels, volume overlap, and adjacency voxels with a Wilcoxon signed rank test followed by false discovery rate correction. We find statistical significance across all bundles for all metrics with one exception in volume overlap. After we run TractSeg and our model, we combine their output masks into a 60 label atlas to evaluate if TractSeg and our model combined can generate a robust, individualized atlas, and observe smoothed, continuous masks in cases that TractSeg did not produce an anatomically plausible output. With the improvement of white matter pathway segmentation masks, we can further understand neurodevelopment on a population level scale, and we can produce reliable estimates of individualized anatomy in pediatric white matter diseases and disorders.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Specifically, our method compresses high-level semantic representations of the video, then uses a conditional diffusion model to reconstruct frames from these semantics. To further improve compression, we characterize motion information with global camera trajectories and foreground segmentation: background motion is compactly represented by camera pose parameters while foreground dynamics by sparse segmentation masks.

To balance power efficiency and estimation performance, we formulate the scheduling task as a finite-horizon dynamic programming (DP) problem. By analyzing the structure of the optimal Q-function, we show that the resulting scheduling policy exhibits a semantic structure that adapts online to the estimation error covariance and channel variations. To obtain a practical solution, we derive a tractable upper bound on the Q-function via a positive semidefinite (PSD) cone decomposition, which enables an efficient approximate scheduling policy and a low-complexity remote estimation algorithm.

Most neuroimaging pipelines fit one model per imaging-derived phenotype (IDP), which scales well but discards multivariate dependence that may encode coordinated patterns. We propose denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) as a unified conditional density estimator for tabular IDPs, from which univariate centiles and deviation scores are derived by sampling. We utilise two denoiser backbones: (i) a feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM) conditioned multilayer perceptron (MLP) and (ii) a tabular transformer with feature self-attention and intersample attention (SAINT), conditioning covariates through learned embeddings. We evaluate on a synthetic benchmark with heteroscedastic and multimodal age effects and on UK Biobank FreeSurfer phenotypes, scaling from dimension of 2 to 200. Our evaluation suite includes centile calibration (absolute centile error, empirical coverage, and the probability integral transform), distributional fidelity (Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests), multivariate dependence diagnostics, and nearest-neighbour memorisation analysis. For low dimensions, diffusion models deliver well-calibrated per-IDP outputs comparable to traditional baselines while jointly modeling realistic dependence structure. At higher dimensions, the transformer backbone remains substantially better calibrated than the MLP and better preserves higher-order dependence, enabling scalable joint normative models that remain compatible with standard per-IDP pipelines.

We develop and defend a nonlinear model of intelligence on which \"general intelligence\" is not a unified capacity but instead the ability to achieve a broad range of goals in a broad range of environments, in a manner that defies nonarbitrary reduction to a single linear quantity. We conclude with implications for adversarial testing approaches to evaluating AI capacities. If AI is strange intelligence, we should expect that even the most capable systems will sometimes fail in seemingly obvious tasks. On a nonlinear model of AI intelligence, such errors on their own do not demonstrate a system's lack of outstanding general intelligence. Conversely, excellent performance on one type of task, such as an IQ test, cannot warrant assumptions of broad capacities beyond that task domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6279\u5224\u7ebf\u6027AI\u53d1\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa'\u719f\u6089\u667a\u80fd'\u548c'\u5947\u602a\u667a\u80fd'\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3aAI\u667a\u80fd\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u5947\u602a\u667a\u80fd\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u8d85\u4eba\u7c7b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u4e9a\u4eba\u7c7b\u8868\u73b0\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cd\u5bf9\u5c06AI\u667a\u80fd\u89c6\u4e3a\u7ebf\u6027\u7edf\u4e00\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u89c2\u70b9\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u80fd\u529b\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa'\u719f\u6089\u667a\u80fd'\uff08\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u667a\u80fd\u6a21\u5f0f\uff09\u548c'\u5947\u602a\u667a\u80fd'\uff08\u8fdd\u80cc\u4eba\u7c7b\u667a\u80fd\u6a21\u5f0f\uff09\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53d1\u5c55\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u667a\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8ba4\u4e3a\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u4e0d\u662f\u5355\u4e00\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5e7f\u6cdb\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e7f\u6cdb\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "AI\u667a\u80fd\u5f88\u53ef\u80fd\u5448\u73b0\u5947\u602a\u667a\u80fd\u7279\u5f81\uff1a\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u8d85\u5e38\uff0c\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u540c\u9886\u57df\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u8d85\u5e38\u6d1e\u5bdf\u529b\u548c\u4ee4\u4eba\u60ca\u8bb6\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u4f7f\u5f97\u5355\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\uff08\u5982IQ\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff09\u4e0d\u80fd\u8bc1\u660e\u5e7f\u6cdb\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u601d\u8003AI\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u770b\u4f3c\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e0d\u5426\u5b9a\u5176\u53ef\u80fd\u5177\u5907\u7a81\u51fa\u7684\u901a\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u3002\u53cd\u4e4b\uff0c\u5355\u4e00\u4efb\u52a1\u4f18\u5f02\u8868\u73b0\u4e5f\u4e0d\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u9886\u57df\u5916\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

In almost all instances, deletions are assumed to be imposed independently of each other and of the sequence context. These assumptions are not valid in practice, since nanopore errors tend to occur within specific contexts. We study contextual nanopore deletion-errors through the example setting of deterministic single deletions following (complete) runlengths of length at least $k$. The model critically depends on the runlength threshold $k$, and we examine two regimes for $k$: a) $k=C\\log n$ for a constant $C\\in(0,1)$; in this case, we study error-correcting codes that can protect from a constant number $t$ of contextual deletions, and show that the minimum redundancy (ignoring lower-order terms) is between $(1-C)t\\log n$ and $2(1-C)t\\log n$, meaning that it is a ($1-C$)-fraction of that of arbitrary $t$-deletion-correcting codes. To complement our non-constructive redundancy upper bound, we design efficiently and encodable and decodable codes for any constant $t$. In particular, for $t=1$ and $C>1/2$ we construct efficient codes with redundancy that essentially matches our non-constructive upper bound; b) $k$ equal a constant; in this case we consider the extremal problem where the number of deletions is not bounded and a deletion is imposed after every run of length at least $k$, which we call the extremal contextual deletion channel. This combinatorial setting arises naturally by considering a probabilistic channel that introduces contextual deletions after each run of length at least $k$ with probability $p$ and taking the limit $p\\to 1$. We obtain sharp bounds on the maximum achievable rate under the extremal contextual deletion channel for arbitrary constant $k$.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Automated screening remains challenging, primarily due to limited data availability and the complex condition involving both structural staging and microvascular abnormalities. Current deep learning models depend heavily on large private datasets and passive multimodal fusion, which commonly fail to generalize on small, imbalanced public cohorts. We thus propose the Context-Aware Asymmetric Ensemble Model (CAA Ensemble) that simulates clinical reasoning through two specialized streams. First, the Multi-Scale Active Query Network (MS-AQNet) serves as a structure specialist, utilizing clinical contexts as dynamic query vectors to spatially control visual feature extraction for localization of the fibrovascular ridge. Secondly, VascuMIL encodes Vascular Topology Maps (VMAP) within a gated Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) network to precisely identify vascular tortuosity. A synergistic meta-learner ensembles these orthogonal signals to resolve diagnostic discordance across multiple objectives. Tested on a highly imbalanced cohort of 188 infants (6,004 images), the framework attained State-of-the-Art performance on two distinct clinical tasks: achieving a Macro F1-Score of 0.93 for Broad ROP staging and an AUC of 0.996 for Plus Disease detection. Crucially, the system features `Glass Box' transparency through counterfactual attention heatmaps and vascular threat maps, proving that clinical metadata dictates the model's visual search. Additionally, this study demonstrates that architectural inductive bias can serve as an effective bridge for the medical AI data gap.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing studies predominantly analyze jailbreak prompts by probing latent representations, often overlooking the causal relationships between interpretable prompt features and jailbreak occurrences. In this work, we propose Causal Analyst, a framework that integrates LLMs into data-driven causal discovery to identify the direct causes of jailbreaks and leverage them for both attack and defense. We introduce a comprehensive dataset comprising 35k jailbreak attempts across seven LLMs, systematically constructed from 100 attack templates and 50 harmful queries, annotated with 37 meticulously designed human-readable prompt features. By jointly training LLM-based prompt encoding and GNN-based causal graph learning, we reconstruct causal pathways linking prompt features to jailbreak responses. Our analysis reveals that specific features, such as \"Positive Character\" and \"Number of Task Steps\", act as direct causal drivers of jailbreaks. We demonstrate the practical utility of these insights through two applications: (1) a Jailbreaking Enhancer that targets identified causal features to significantly boost attack success rates on public benchmarks, and (2) a Guardrail Advisor that utilizes the learned causal graph to extract true malicious intent from obfuscated queries. Extensive experiments, including baseline comparisons and causal structure validation, confirm the robustness of our causal analysis and its superiority over non-causal approaches.

Despite strong results in open-domain settings, existing agentic search frameworks commonly treat long documents as flat collections of chunks, underutilizing document-native priors such as hierarchical organization and sequential discourse structure. We introduce DeepRead, a structure-aware, multi-turn document reasoning agent that explicitly operationalizes these priors for long-document question answering. DeepRead leverages LLM-based OCR model to convert PDFs into structured Markdown that preserves headings and paragraph boundaries. It then indexes documents at the paragraph level and assigns each paragraph a coordinate-style metadata key encoding its section identity and in-section order. Building on this representation, DeepRead equips the LLM with two complementary tools: a Retrieve tool that localizes relevant paragraphs while exposing their structural coordinates (with lightweight scanning context), and a ReadSection tool that enables contiguous, order-preserving reading within a specified section and paragraph range.

This work investigates the feasibility of cross-modality weak supervision for scenarios where pathology is visible in one modality (MRI) but absent in another (CT). We present a hybrid registration-segmentation framework that combines MSCGUNet for inter-modal image registration with a UNet-based segmentation module, enabling registration-assisted pseudo-label generation for CT images. Our evaluation on the CHAOS dataset demonstrates that the pipeline can successfully register and segment healthy liver anatomy, achieving a Dice score of 0.72. However, when applied to clinical data containing tumours, performance degrades substantially (Dice score of 0.16), revealing the fundamental limitations of current registration methods when the target pathology lacks corresponding visual features in the target modality. We analyse the \"domain gap\" and \"feature absence\" problems, demonstrating that whilst spatial propagation of labels via registration is feasible for visible structures, segmenting truly invisible pathology remains an open challenge. Our findings highlight that registration-based label transfer cannot compensate for the absence of discriminative features in the target modality, providing important insights for future research in cross-modality medical image analysis.

We study distribution-level voltage regulation enabled by flexibility in LLM inference, using batch size as a control knob that trades off the voltage impacts of GPU power consumption against inference latency and token throughput. We first formulate this problem as an optimization problem and then realize it as an online feedback optimization controller that leverages measurements from both the power grid and GPU systems.

Project website: https://vista-vla.github.io/", "summary": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of robotic manipulation tasks. Despite the success, extending large pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to the action space can induce vision-action misalignment, where action predictions exhibit weak dependence on the current visual state, leading to unreliable action outputs. In this work, we study VLA models through the lens of visual conditioning and empirically show that successful rollouts consistently exhibit stronger visual dependence than failed ones. Motivated by this observation, we propose a training framework that explicitly strengthens visual conditioning in VLA models. Our approach first aligns action prediction with visual input via preference optimization on a track-following surrogate task, and then transfers the enhanced alignment to instruction-following task through latent-space distillation during supervised finetuning. Without introducing architectural modifications or additional data collection, our method improves both visual conditioning and task performance for discrete OpenVLA, and further yields consistent gains when extended to the continuous OpenVLA-OFT setting.

Planning problems in the open world often involve various aspects of incomplete information and unknowns, e.g., objects involved, human goals/intents -- thus leading to knowledge gaps in joint planning. We consider the problem of discovering optimal interaction strategies for AI agents to actively elicit human inputs in object-driven planning. To this end, we propose Minimal Information Neuro-Symbolic Tree (MINT) to reason about the impact of knowledge gaps and leverage self-play with MINT to optimize the AI agent's elicitation strategies and queries. More precisely, MINT builds a symbolic tree by making propositions of possible human-AI interactions and by consulting a neural planning policy to estimate the uncertainty in planning outcomes caused by remaining knowledge gaps. Finally, we leverage LLM to search and summarize MINT's reasoning process and curate a set of queries to optimally elicit human inputs for best planning performance. By considering a family of extended Markov decision processes with knowledge gaps, we analyze the return guarantee for a given MINT with active human elicitation.

However, traditional frequency-domain channel sounding methods suffer from low efficiency due to a prohibitive number of frequency points to avoid delay ambiguity. This paper proposes a novel channel sounding framework involving sparse nonuniform sampling along with a likelihood-rectified space-alternating generalized expectation-maximization (LR-SAGE) algorithm for multipath component extraction. This framework enables the acquisition of channel datasets that are tens or even hundreds of times larger within the same channel measurement duration, thereby providing the massive data required to harness the full potential of AI scaling laws. Specifically, we propose a Parabolic Frequency Sampling (PFS) strategy that non-uniformly distributes frequency points, effectively eliminating delay ambiguity while reducing sampling overhead by orders of magnitude. To efficiently extract multipath components (MPCs) from the channel data measured by PFS, we develop a LR-SAGE algorithm, rectifying the likelihood distortion caused by nonuniform sampling and molecular absorption effect. Simulation results and experimental validation at 280--300~GHz confirm that the proposed PFS and LR-SAGE algorithm not only achieve 50$\\times$ faster measurement, a 98\\% reduction in data volume and a 99.96\\% reduction in post-processing computational complexity, but also successfully captures MPCs and channel characteristics consistent with traditional exhaustive measurements, demonstrating its potential as a fundamental enabler for constructing the massive ISAC datasets required by AI-native 6G systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e6G\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fe1\u9053\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u7a00\u758f\u975e\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408LR-SAGE\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u5f84\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728280-300GHz\u9891\u6bb5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8650\u500d\u6d4b\u91cf\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u548c98%\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "motivation": "6G\u613f\u666f\u4e2d\u7684AI\u548cISAC\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u8981\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u4fe1\u9053\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u9891\u57df\u4fe1\u9053\u6d4b\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u9700\u907f\u514d\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6a21\u7cca\u800c\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u9891\u70b9\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3AI\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u629b\u7269\u7ebf\u9891\u7387\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u975e\u5747\u5300\u9891\u70b9\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6a21\u7cca\u5e76\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u91c7\u6837\u5f00\u9500\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86LR-SAGE\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4fee\u6b63\u975e\u5747\u5300\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u5438\u6536\u6548\u5e94\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u5931\u771f\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u5f84\u5206\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u548c280-300GHz\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8650\u500d\u6d4b\u91cf\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u51cf\u5c1198%\uff0c\u540e\u5904\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e99.96%\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u6355\u83b7\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u8be6\u5c3d\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u591a\u5f84\u5206\u91cf\u548c\u4fe1\u9053\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u6784\u5efaAI\u539f\u751f6G\u7cfb\u7edf\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21ISAC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u4f7f\u80fd\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u652f\u6301\u4fe1\u9053\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8AI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

Experiments demonstrate a 78.1% balanced accuracy and a reduced severe-to-normal misclassification rate of 2.13% compared with supervised training from scratch.

However, their reliance on potentially untrusted training pipelines or supply chains introduces significant security vulnerabilities. This paper investigates backdoor (Trojan) attacks against neural controllers, using a differential-drive mobile robot platform as a case study. In particular, assuming that the robot's tracking controller is implemented as a neural network, we design a lightweight, parallel Trojan network that can be embedded within the controller. This malicious module remains dormant during normal operation but, upon detecting a highly specific trigger condition defined by the robot's pose and goal parameters, compromises the primary controller's wheel velocity commands, resulting in undesired and potentially unsafe robot behaviours. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation of the proposed Trojan network, which is validated through simulation under two different attack scenarios. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed attack and demonstrate that neural network-based robotic control systems are subject to potentially critical security threats.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Specifically, we evaluate Goodfire's Auto Steer against prompt engineering baselines across 14 steering queries (covering innocuous and safety-relevant behaviors) on 171 Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) questions using Llama-8B and Llama-70B, measuring accuracy, coherence, and behavioral control. Our findings show that Auto Steer successfully modifies target behaviors (achieving scores of 3.33 vs. 2.98 for prompting on Llama-8B and 3.57 vs. 3.10 on Llama-70B), but causes dramatic performance degradation: accuracy on the MMLU questions drops from 66% to 46% on Llama-8B and 87% to 73% on Llama-70B, with coherence falling from 4.62 to 2.24 and 4.94 to 3.89 respectively.

As these tools become integrated into undergraduate and graduate coursework, it is important to understand how reliably they support mathematically rigorous thinking. This study examines the performance of a LLM on two related graph theoretic problems: a solved problem concerning the gracefulness of line graphs and an open problem for which no solution is currently known. We use an eight stage evaluation protocol that reflects authentic mathematical inquiry, including interpretation, exploration, strategy formation, and proof construction.\n  The model performed strongly on the solved problem, producing correct definitions, identifying relevant structures, recalling appropriate results without hallucination, and constructing a valid proof confirmed by a graph theory expert. For the open problem, the model generated coherent interpretations and plausible exploratory strategies but did not advance toward a solution. It did not fabricate results and instead acknowledged uncertainty, which is consistent with the explicit prompting instructions that directed the model to avoid inventing theorems or unsupported claims.\n  These findings indicate that LLMs can support exploration of established material but remain limited in tasks requiring novel mathematical insight or critical structural reasoning.

We argue that UQ research must shift to realistic settings with interactive agents, and that a new principled framework for agent UQ is needed. This paper presents the first general formulation of agent UQ that subsumes broad classes of existing UQ setups. Under this formulation, we show that prior works implicitly treat LLM UQ as an uncertainty accumulation process, a viewpoint that breaks down for interactive agents in an open world. In contrast, we propose a novel perspective, a conditional uncertainty reduction process, that explicitly models reducible uncertainty over an agent's trajectory by highlighting \"interactivity\" of actions.

To reduce the computational complexity of existing sampling-based optimization methods, we propose a new low-complexity yet efficient beam coverage design. To this end, we first formulate a general beam coverage optimization problem to maximize the worst-case beamforming gain over a target region. For the far-field case, we show that the beam coverage design can be viewed as a spatial-frequency filtering problem, where angular coverage can be achieved by weight-shaping in the antenna domain via an inverse FT, yielding an infinite-length weighting sequence. Under the constraint of a finite number of antennas, a surrogate scheme is proposed by directly truncating this sequence, which inevitably introduces a roll-off effect at the angular boundaries, yielding degraded worst-case beamforming gain. To address this issue, we characterize the finite-antenna-induced roll-off effect, based on which a roll-off-aware design with a protective zoom is developed to ensure a flat beamforming-gain profile within the target angular region. Next, we extend the proposed method to the near-field case. Specifically, by applying a first-order Taylor approximation to the near-field channel steering vector (CSV), the two-dimensional (2D) beam coverage design (in both angle and inverse-range) can be transformed into a 2D inverse FT, leading to a low-complexity beamforming design. Furthermore, an inherent near-field range defocusing effect is observed, indicating that sufficiently wide angular coverage results in range-insensitive beam steering. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed FT-based approach achieves a comparable worst-case beamforming performance with that of conventional sampling-based optimization methods while significantly reducing the computational complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To be published in the VISAPP", "summary": "Hyperbolic representation learning has been widely used to extract implicit hierarchies within data, and recently it has found its way to the open-world classification task of Generalized Category Discovery (GCD). However, prior hyperbolic GCD methods only use hyperbolic geometry for representation learning and transform back to Euclidean geometry when clustering. We hypothesize this is suboptimal. Therefore, we present Hyperbolic Clustered GCD (HC-GCD), which learns embeddings in the Lorentz Hyperboloid model of hyperbolic geometry, and clusters these embeddings directly in hyperbolic space using a hyperbolic K-Means algorithm. We test our model on the Semantic Shift Benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that HC-GCD is on par with the previous state-of-the-art hyperbolic GCD method. Furthermore, we show that using hyperbolic K-Means leads to better accuracy than Euclidean K-Means. We carry out ablation studies showing that clipping the norm of the Euclidean embeddings leads to decreased accuracy in clustering unseen classes, and increased accuracy for seen classes, while the overall accuracy is dataset dependent. We also show that using hyperbolic K-Means leads to more consistent clusters when varying the label granularity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u53cc\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u66f2K-means\u805a\u7c7b\u5728\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u53cc\u66f2\u9762\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u4ec5\u5728\u53cc\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u793a\u540e\u8f6c\u56de\u6b27\u6c0f\u7a7a\u95f4\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u53cc\u66f2\u5e7f\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u66f2\u51e0\u4f55\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u805a\u7c7b\u9636\u6bb5\u8f6c\u56de\u6b27\u6c0f\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u6b21\u4f18\u7684\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u53cc\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53cc\u66f2\u805a\u7c7b\u5e7f\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6d1b\u4f26\u5179\u53cc\u66f2\u9762\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u66f2K-means\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u53cc\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6b27\u6c0fK-means\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u53cc\u66f2\u5e7f\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\u53d1\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4f46\u53cc\u66f2K-means\u76f8\u6bd4\u6b27\u6c0fK-means\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u622a\u65ad\u6b27\u6c0f\u5d4c\u5165\u8303\u6570\u5bf9\u672a\u89c1\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6709\u8d1f\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bf9\u5df2\u89c1\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6709\u6b63\u9762\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u603b\u4f53\u6548\u679c\u56e0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u800c\u5f02\uff1b\u53cc\u66f2K-means\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6807\u7b7e\u7c92\u5ea6\u4e0b\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5e7f\u4e49\u7c7b\u522b\u53d1\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u53cc\u66f2\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\u6bd4\u51e0\u4f55\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u53cc\u66f2K-means\u76f8\u6bd4\u6b27\u6c0fK-means\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002"}}

This study presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based framework to enhance adaptive collision avoidance in ADR missions, specifically for multi-debris removal using small satellites. Small satellites are increasingly adopted due to their flexibility, cost effectiveness, and maneuverability, making them well suited for dynamic missions such as ADR.\n  Building on existing work in multi-debris rendezvous, the framework integrates refueling strategies, efficient mission planning, and adaptive collision avoidance to optimize spacecraft rendezvous operations. The proposed approach employs a masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, enabling the RL agent to dynamically adjust maneuvers in response to real-time orbital conditions.

Unlike third-person gaze estimation, this setting lacks explicit head or eye signals, requiring models to infer current visual attention from sparse, indirect cues such as hand-object interactions and salient scene content. We observe that gaze exhibits strong temporal continuity during goal-directed activities: knowing where a person looked recently provides a powerful prior for predicting where they look next. Inspired by vision-conditioned autoregressive decoding in vision-language models, we propose ARGaze, which reformulates gaze estimation as sequential prediction: at each timestep, a transformer decoder predicts current gaze by conditioning on (i) current visual features and (ii) a fixed-length Gaze Context Window of recent gaze target estimates. This design enforces causality and enables bounded-resource streaming inference. We achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple egocentric benchmarks under online evaluation, with extensive ablations validating that autoregressive modeling with bounded gaze history is critical for robust prediction.

In parallel, physics-based models such as ordinary differential equations (ODEs) provide mechanistic structure for many dynamical processes. Integrating these paradigms potentially allows physical knowledge to act as an inductive bias, improving identifiability, stability, and robustness of causal discovery in dynamical systems. However, such integration remains challenging: real dynamical systems often exhibit feedback, cyclic interactions, and non-stationary data trend, while many widely used causal discovery methods are formulated under acyclicity or equilibrium-based assumptions. In this work, we propose an integrative causal discovery framework for dynamical systems that leverages partial physical knowledge as an inductive bias. Specifically, we model system evolution as a stochastic differential equation (SDE), where the drift term encodes known ODE dynamics and the diffusion term corresponds to unknown causal couplings beyond the prescribed physics. We develop a scalable sparsity-inducing MLE algorithm that exploits causal graph structure for efficient parameter estimation. Under mild conditions, we establish guarantees to recover the causal graph. Experiments on dynamical systems with diverse causal structures show that our approach improves causal graph recovery and produces more stable, physically consistent estimates than purely data-driven state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Despite the promise related to availability and scale, the single most pressing question in AI for mental health is whether these tools are safe. The Validation of Ethical and Responsible AI in Mental Health (VERA-MH) evaluation was recently proposed to meet the urgent need for an evidence-based automated safety benchmark. This study aimed to examine the clinical validity and reliability of the VERA-MH evaluation for AI safety in suicide risk detection and response. We first simulated a large set of conversations between large language model (LLM)-based users (user-agents) and general-purpose AI chatbots. Licensed mental health clinicians used a rubric (scoring guide) to independently rate the simulated conversations for safe and unsafe chatbot behaviors, as well as user-agent realism. An LLM-based judge used the same scoring rubric to evaluate the same set of simulated conversations. We then compared rating alignment across (a) individual clinicians and (b) clinician consensus and the LLM judge, and (c) examined clinicians' ratings of user-agent realism. Individual clinicians were generally consistent with one another in their safety ratings (chance-corrected inter-rater reliability [IRR]: 0.77), thus establishing a gold-standard clinical reference. The LLM judge was strongly aligned with this clinical consensus (IRR: 0.81) overall and within key conditions. Clinician raters generally perceived the user-agents to be realistic. For the potential mental health benefits of AI chatbots to be realized, attention to safety is paramount. Findings from this human evaluation study support the clinical validity and reliability of VERA-MH: an open-source, fully automated AI safety evaluation for mental health.

Rasmussen's dynamic safety model motivates drift under competing pressures, but operationalizing it for software is difficult because many high-value operational signals (effort, remaining margin, incident impact) are compositional and their parts evolve. We propose a vision for drift observability on the simplex: model drift and boundary proximity in Aitchison geometry to obtain coordinate-invariant direction and distance-to-safety in interpretable balance coordinates. To remain comparable under churn, a monitor would continuously refresh its part inventory and policy-defined boundaries from engineering artifacts and apply lineage-aware aggregation.

A common approach to track gloved hands is to directly use the sensor signals (e.g., angular velocity, gravity orientation) to estimate 3D hand poses. However, sensor-based tracking can be restrictive in practice as the accuracy is often impacted by sensor signal and calibration quality. Recent advances in vision-based approaches have achieved strong performance on human hands via large-scale pre-training, but their performance on gloved hands with distinct visual appearances remains underexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic evaluation of vision-based hand tracking models on gloved hands under both zero-shot and fine-tuning setups. Our analysis shows that existing bare-hand models suffer from substantial performance degradation on sensing gloves due to large appearance gap between bare-hand and glove designs. We therefore propose AirGlove, which leverages existing gloves to generalize the learned glove representations towards new gloves with limited data. Experiments with multiple sensing gloves show that AirGlove effectively generalizes the hand pose models to new glove designs and achieves a significant performance boost over the compared schemes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Prior approaches mitigate this via explicit smoothness penalties, trajectory regularization, or modified probability paths and solvers. We introduce Temporal Pair Consistency (TPC), a lightweight variance-reduction principle that couples velocity predictions at paired timesteps along the same probability path, operating entirely at the estimator level without modifying the model architecture, probability path, or solver. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that TPC induces a quadratic, trajectory-coupled regularization that provably reduces gradient variance while preserving the underlying flow-matching objective. Instantiated within flow matching, TPC improves sample quality and efficiency across CIFAR-10 and ImageNet at multiple resolutions, achieving lower FID at identical or lower computational cost than prior methods, and extends seamlessly to modern SOTA-style pipelines with noise-augmented training, score-based denoising, and rectified flow.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTPC\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u51cf\u5c0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8026\u5408\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u901f\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u6216\u8def\u5f84\u5c31\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf", "motivation": "\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b(\u5982\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u6d41\u5339\u914d)\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u72ec\u7acb\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u5dee\u5927\u91c7\u6837\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\uff1b\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u5e73\u6ed1\u60e9\u7f5a\u6216\u8def\u5f84\u4fee\u6539\uff1b\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u5dee\u51cf\u5c0f\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u95f4\u6210\u5bf9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027(TPC)\uff1a\u5728\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5c42\u9762\u8026\u5408\u540c\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\u6210\u5bf9\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u4ea7\u751f\u8f68\u8ff9\u8026\u5408\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u6b63\u5219\u9879\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u5dee\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u76ee\u6807", "result": "TPC\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u5728CIFAR-10\u548cImageNet\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u6837\u672c\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u7b49\u6216\u66f4\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fbe\u5230\u66f4\u4f4eFID\uff0c\u5e76\u517c\u5bb9\u566a\u58f0\u589e\u5f3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u5206\u6570\u964d\u566a\u548c\u6574\u6d41\u6d41\u7b49\u73b0\u4ee3\u6d41\u7a0b", "conclusion": "TPC\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u5dee\u51cf\u5c0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\u6216\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e14\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5f3a"}}

This work compares three planners for the constrained multi-debris rendezvous problem in Low Earth Orbit: a nominal Masked Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) policy trained under fixed mission parameters, a domain-randomized Masked PPO policy trained across varying mission constraints for improved robustness, and a plain Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) baseline. Evaluations are conducted in a high-fidelity orbital simulation with refueling, realistic transfer dynamics, and randomized debris fields across 300 test cases in nominal, reduced fuel, and reduced mission time scenarios. Results show that nominal PPO achieves top performance when conditions match training but degrades sharply under distributional shift, while domain-randomized PPO exhibits improved adaptability with only moderate loss in nominal performance. MCTS consistently handles constraint changes best due to online replanning but incurs orders-of-magnitude higher computation time. The findings underline a trade-off between the speed of learned policies and the adaptability of search-based methods, and suggest that combining training-time diversity with online planning could be a promising path for future resilient ADR mission planners.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To surmount these challenges, we propose SHaSaM (Submodular Hard Sample Mining), a novel combinatorial approach that models fairness-driven representation learning as a submodular hard-sample mining problem. Our two-stage approach comprises of SHaSaM-MINE, which introduces a submodular subset selection strategy to mine hard positives and negatives - effectively mitigating data imbalance, and SHaSaM-LEARN, which introduces a family of combinatorial loss functions based on Submodular Conditional Mutual Information to maximize the decision boundary between target classes while minimizing the influence of sensitive attributes. This unified formulation restricts the model from learning features tied to sensitive attributes, significantly enhancing fairness without sacrificing performance. Experiments on CelebA and UTKFace demonstrate that SHaSaM achieves state-of-the-art results, with up to 2.7 points improvement in model fairness (Equalized Odds) and a 3.5% gain in Accuracy, within fewer epochs as compared to existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

As the policy drifts, a static reference, however, can become increasingly miscalibrated, leading to distributional mismatch and amplifying spurious preference signals under noisy supervision. Conversely, reference-free variants avoid mismatch but often suffer from unconstrained reward drift. We propose Geometric Anchor Preference Optimization (GAPO), which replaces the fixed reference with a dynamic, geometry-aware anchor: an adversarial local perturbation of the current policy within a small radius that serves as a pessimistic baseline. This anchor enables an adaptive reweighting mechanism, modulating the importance of each preference pair based on its local sensitivity. We further introduce the Anchor Gap, the reward discrepancy between the policy and its anchor, and show under smoothness conditions that it approximates worst-case local margin degradation. Optimizing a logistic objective weighted by this gap downweights geometrically brittle instances while emphasizing robust preference signals. Across diverse noise settings, GAPO consistently improves robustness while matching or improving performance on standard LLM alignment and reasoning benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "GAPO\u63d0\u51fa\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u951a\u70b9\u53d6\u4ee3DPO\u4e2d\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u5bf9\u6297\u6270\u52a8\u521b\u5efa\u60b2\u89c2\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u951a\u70b9\u95f4\u8ddd\u5bf9\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u566a\u58f0\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "DPO\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u53c2\u8003\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u7b56\u7565\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u9759\u6001\u53c2\u8003\u4f1a\u53d8\u5f97\u6821\u51c6\u5931\u51c6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u5e76\u653e\u5927\u566a\u58f0\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u7684\u865a\u5047\u504f\u597d\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\u800c\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u53d8\u4f53\u53c8\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u51e0\u4f55\u951a\u70b9\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316(GAPO)\uff0c\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u951a\u70b9\u66ff\u4ee3\u56fa\u5b9a\u53c2\u8003\u2014\u2014\u5728\u5f53\u524d\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5c0f\u534a\u5f84\u5185\u521b\u5efa\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5c40\u90e8\u6270\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e3a\u60b2\u89c2\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u951a\u70b9\u95f4\u8ddd\uff08\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u5176\u951a\u70b9\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5dee\u5f02\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5e73\u6ed1\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u8fb9\u754c\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u951a\u70b9\u95f4\u8ddd\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u76ee\u6807\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u51e0\u4f55\u8106\u5f31\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7684\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u504f\u597d\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0cGAPO\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u6807\u51c6LLM\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u5339\u914d\u6216\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "GAPO\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u51e0\u4f55\u611f\u77e5\u951a\u70b9\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u56fa\u5b9a\u53c2\u8003\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Arbitrary data are straightforwardly encoded as graphs whose edges correspond to codes from a small fixed primitive set of elemental pairwise relations, such that simple relational encoding is not an add-on, but occurs intrinsically within the most basic components of the system. A novel graph-Hamiltonian operator calculates energies among these encodings, with ground states denoting simultaneous satisfaction of all relation constraints among graph vertices. The method solely uses radically low-precision arithmetic; computational cost is correspondingly low, and scales linearly with the number of edges in the data. The resulting unconventional architecture can process standard ANN examples, but also produces representations that exhibit characteristics of symbolic computation. Specifically, the method identifies simple logical relational structures in these data (part-of; next-to), building hierarchical representations that enable abductive inferential steps generating relational position-based encodings, rather than solely statistical representations. Notably, an equivalent set of ANN operations are derived, identifying a special case of embedded vector encodings that may constitute a useful approach to current work in higher-level semantic representation. The very simple current state of the implemented system invites additional tools and improvements.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce a structured multi-evaluator framework for assessing LLM reasoning in Merchant Category Code (MCC)-based merchant risk assessment, combining a five-criterion rubric with Monte-Carlo scoring to evaluate rationale quality and evaluator stability. Five frontier LLMs generate and cross-evaluate MCC risk rationales under attributed and anonymized conditions. To establish a judge-independent reference, we introduce a consensus-deviation metric that eliminates circularity by comparing each judge's score to the mean of all other judges, yielding a theoretically grounded measure of self-evaluation and cross-model deviation. Results reveal substantial heterogeneity: GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet show negative self-evaluation bias (-0.33, -0.31), while Gemini-2.5 Pro and Grok 4 display positive bias (+0.77, +0.71), with bias attenuating by 25.8 percent under anonymization. Evaluation by 26 payment-industry experts shows LLM judges assign scores averaging +0.46 points above human consensus, and that the negative bias of GPT-5.1 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet reflects closer alignment with human judgment. Ground-truth validation using payment-network data shows four models exhibit statistically significant alignment (Spearman rho = 0.56 to 0.77), confirming that the framework captures genuine quality. Overall, the framework provides a replicable basis for evaluating LLM-as-a-judge systems in payment-risk workflows and highlights the need for bias-aware protocols in operational financial settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The proposed framework reformulates pool-based AL as a noisy lossy compression problem by mapping pool observations to noisy symbol observations, data selection to compression, and learning to decoding. This correspondence enables a unified information-theoretic analysis of data selection and learning in pool-based AL. Applying finite blocklength analysis of noisy lossy compression, we derive information-theoretic lower bounds on label complexity and generalization error that serve as theoretical limits for a given learning algorithm under its associated optimal data selection strategy. Specifically, our bounds include terms that reflect overfitting induced by the learning algorithm and the discrepancy between its inductive bias and the target task, and are closely related to established information-theoretic bounds and stability theory, which have not been previously applied to the analysis of pool-based AL.

Preference based alignment methods like RLHF derive their training signal from human raters, yet these rater pools are typically convenience samples that systematically over represent some demographics and under represent others. We introduce Democratic Preference Optimization, or DemPO, a framework that applies algorithmic sortition, the same mechanism used to construct citizen assemblies, to preference based fine tuning. DemPO offers two training schemes. Hard Panel trains exclusively on preferences from a quota satisfying mini public sampled via sortition. Soft Panel retains all data but reweights each rater by their inclusion probability under the sortition lottery. We prove that Soft Panel weighting recovers the expected Hard Panel objective in closed form. Using a public preference dataset that pairs human judgments with rater demographics and a seventy five clause constitution independently elicited from a representative United States panel, we evaluate Llama models from one billion to eight billion parameters fine tuned under each scheme. Across six aggregation methods, the Hard Panel consistently ranks first and the Soft Panel consistently outperforms the unweighted baseline, with effect sizes growing as model capacity increases. These results demonstrate that enforcing demographic representativeness at the preference collection stage, rather than post hoc correction, yields models whose behavior better reflects values elicited from representative publics.", "AI": {"tldr": "DemPO\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u62bd\u7b7e\u5236\u9009\u62e9\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3AI\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6c11\u4e3b\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u7684AI\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982RLHF\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u4fbf\u5229\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u4eba\u53e3\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4eba\u7fa4\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6c11\u4e3b\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff08DemPO\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\uff1a1\uff09\u786c\u9762\u677f\uff1a\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u901a\u8fc7\u62bd\u7b7e\u5236\u9009\u51fa\u7684\u6ee1\u8db3\u914d\u989d\u8981\u6c42\u7684\u5fae\u578b\u516c\u4f17\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u7684\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\uff1b2\uff09\u8f6f\u9762\u677f\uff1a\u4fdd\u7559\u6240\u6709\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u6839\u636e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bc4\u5206\u8005\u5728\u62bd\u7b7e\u5f69\u7968\u4e2d\u7684\u5165\u9009\u6982\u7387\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743", "result": "\u57286\u79cd\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u786c\u9762\u677f\u65b9\u6848\u59cb\u7ec8\u6392\u540d\u7b2c\u4e00\uff0c\u8f6f\u9762\u677f\u65b9\u6848\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u672a\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u5dee\u5f02\u66f4\u52a0\u660e\u663e\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u5177\u6709\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7f8e\u56fd\u9762\u677f\u72ec\u7acb\u6536\u96c6\u768475\u6761\u5baa\u6cd5\u6761\u6b3e\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30", "conclusion": "\u5728\u504f\u597d\u6536\u96c6\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5236\u5b9e\u65bd\u4eba\u53e3\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\uff08\u800c\u975e\u4e8b\u540e\u6821\u6b63\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u53cd\u6620\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u516c\u4f17\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u6c11\u4e3b\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u673a\u5236\u5bf9AI\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027"}}

To connect intelligence to physical efficiency, we propose two complementary bits-per-joule metrics under explicit accounting conventions: (1) Thermodynamic Epiplexity per Joule -- bits of structural information about a theoretical environment-instance variable newly encoded in an agent's internal state per unit measured energy within a stated boundary -- and (2) Empowerment per Joule -- the embodied sensorimotor channel capacity (control information) per expected energetic cost over a fixed horizon. These provide two axes of physical intelligence: recognition (model-building) vs.control (action influence). Drawing on stochastic thermodynamics, we show how a Landauer-scale closed-cycle benchmark for epiplexity acquisition follows as a corollary of a standard thermodynamic-learning inequality under explicit subsystem assumptions, and we clarify how Landauer-scaled costs act as closed-cycle benchmarks under explicit reset/reuse and boundary-closure assumptions; conversely, we give a simple decoupling construction showing that without such assumptions -- and without charging for externally prepared low-entropy resources (e.g.fresh memory) crossing the boundary -- information gain and in-boundary dissipation need not be tightly linked. For empirical settings where the latent structure variable is unavailable, we align the operational notion of epiplexity with compute-bounded MDL epiplexity and recommend reporting MDL-epiplexity / compression-gain surrogates as companions. Finally, we propose a unified efficiency framework that reports both metrics together with a minimal checklist of boundary/energy accounting, coarse-graining/noise, horizon/reset, and cost conventions to reduce ambiguity and support consistent bits-per-joule comparisons, and we sketch connections to energy-adjusted scaling analyses.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we develop a privacy-preserving method that protects each agent's reference signal from external eavesdroppers and honest-but-curious agents while achieving the same convergence accuracy and convergence rate as conventional DAC. Our approach masks the reference signals by having each agent draw a random real number for each neighbor, exchanges that number over an encrypted channel at the initialization, and computes a masking value to form a masked reference. Then the agents run the conventional DAC algorithm using the masked references. Convergence and privacy analyses show that the proposed algorithm matches the convergence properties of conventional DAC while preserving the privacy of the reference signals.

The resulting interactions are geometry-aware and inspired by inverse-square interactions in physics. Our method, Spherical Linearized Attention with Yat Kernels (SLAY), constrains queries and keys to the unit sphere so that attention depends only on angular alignment. Using Bernstein's theorem, we express the spherical Yat-kernel as a nonnegative mixture of polynomial-exponential product kernels and derive a strictly positive random-feature approximation enabling linear-time O(L) attention.

This limitation is especially problematic for systems that rely on neural network (NN)-based state estimators, which can be highly sensitive to noise and adversarial input perturbations. We address these problems by introducing GUARDIAN: Guaranteed Uncertainty-Aware Reachability Defense against Adversarial INterference, a safety filtering framework that provides formal safety guarantees for systems with NN-based state estimators. At runtime, GUARDIAN uses neural network verification tools to provide guaranteed bounds on the system's state estimate given possible perturbations to its observation. It then uses a modified Hamilton-Jacobi reachability formulation to construct a safety filter that adjusts the nominal control input based on the verified state bounds and safety constraints. The result is an uncertainty-aware filter that ensures safety despite the system's reliance on an NN estimator with noisy, possibly adversarial, input observations. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that GUARDIAN effectively defends systems against adversarial attacks that would otherwise lead to a violation of safety constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We present the Generative-Transformer-based Self-Supervised Video Judge (\\modelname), a novel evaluation model that transforms state-of-the-art video generation models into powerful temporally-aware reward models. Our key insight is that generative models can be reformulated as energy-based models (EBMs) that assign low energy to high-quality videos and high energy to degraded ones, enabling them to discriminate video quality with remarkable precision when trained via contrastive objectives. To prevent the model from exploiting superficial differences between real and generated videos, we design challenging synthetic negative videos through controlled latent-space perturbations: temporal slicing, feature swapping, and frame shuffling, which simulate realistic but subtle visual degradations. This forces the model to learn meaningful spatiotemporal features rather than trivial artifacts. \\modelname achieves state-of-the-art performance on GenAI-Bench and MonteBench using only 30K human-annotations: $6\\times$ to $65\\times$ fewer than existing VLM-based approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While existing tensor decomposition and anomaly detection methods provide useful insights, they face the following two limitations. (i) They cannot handle heterogeneous tensor streams, which comprises both categorical attributes(e.g., IP address) and continuous attributes(e.g., packet length). They typically require either discretizing continuous attributes or treating categorical attributes as continuous, both of which distort the underlying statistical properties of the data.Furthermore, incorrect assumptions about the distribution family of continuous attributes often degrade the model's performance. (ii) They discretize timestamps, failing to track the temporal dynamics of streams(e.g., trends, abnormal events), which makes them ineffective for detecting anomalies at the group level, referred to as 'group anomalies' (e.g, DoS attacks). To address these challenges, we propose HeteroComp, a method for continuously summarizing heterogeneous tensor streams into 'components' representing latent groups in each attribute and their temporal dynamics, and detecting group anomalies. Our method employs Gaussian process priors to model unknown distributions of continuous attributes, and temporal dynamics, which directly estimate probability densities from data. Extracted components give concise but effective summarization, enabling accurate group anomaly detection.

Yet widely used dense embeddings are often extremely high-dimensional, incurring substantial costs in storage, memory, and inference latency. To address these, Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR) is recently proposed as a promising direction, mapping dense embeddings into high-dimensional but k-sparse vectors, in contrast to compact dense embeddings such as Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL). Despite its promise, CSR suffers severe degradation in the ultra-sparse regime, where over 80% of neurons remain inactive, leaving much of its efficiency potential unrealized. In this paper, we introduce CSRv2, a principled training approach designed to make ultra-sparse embeddings viable. CSRv2 stabilizes sparsity learning through progressive k-annealing, enhances representational quality via supervised contrastive objectives, and ensures end-to-end adaptability with full backbone finetuning. CSRv2 reduces dead neurons from 80% to 20% and delivers a 14% accuracy gain at k=2, bringing ultra-sparse embeddings on par with CSR at k=8 and MRL at 32 dimensions, all with only two active features. While maintaining comparable performance, CSRv2 delivers a 7x speedup over MRL, and yields up to 300x improvements in compute and memory efficiency relative to dense embeddings in text representation. Extensive experiments across text and vision demonstrate that CSRv2 makes ultra-sparse embeddings practical without compromising performance, where CSRv2 achieves 7%/4% improvement over CSR when k=4 and further increases this gap to 14%/6% when k=2 in text/vision representation. By making extreme sparsity viable, CSRv2 broadens the design space for real-time and edge-deployable AI systems where both embedding quality and efficiency are critical.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Despite their popularity, existing analyses for these algorithms are disparate, relying on different proof techniques tailored to each method. Furthermore, the original proof of SAG is known to be notoriously involved, requiring computer-aided analysis. Focusing on finite-sum optimization with smooth and strongly convex objective functions, our main contribution is to develop a single unified convergence analysis that applies to all three algorithms: SAG, SAGA, and IAG. Our analysis features two key steps: (i) establishing a bound on delays due to stochastic sub-sampling using simple concentration tools, and (ii) carefully designing a novel Lyapunov function that accounts for such delays. The resulting proof is short and modular, providing the first high-probability bounds for SAG and SAGA that can be seamlessly extended to non-convex objectives and Markov sampling. As an immediate byproduct of our new analysis technique, we obtain the best known rates for the IAG algorithm, significantly improving upon prior bounds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8eSAG\u3001SAGA\u548cIAG\u4e09\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u539f\u6709\u590d\u6742\u7684\u8bc1\u660e\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u968f\u673a\u65b9\u5dee\u7f29\u51cf\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5982SAG\u3001SAGA\uff09\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08\u5982IAG\uff09\u5206\u6790\u5206\u6563\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5404\u81ea\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8bc1\u660e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662fSAG\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u8bc1\u660e\u6781\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u5206\u6790\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u3001\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6709\u9650\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5149\u6ed1\u5f3a\u51f8\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1a1\uff09\u5229\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u96c6\u4e2d\u5de5\u5177\u5efa\u7acb\u968f\u673a\u5b50\u91c7\u6837\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u754c\u9650\uff1b2\uff09\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u674e\u96c5\u666e\u8bfa\u592b\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u8003\u8651\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "result": "\u5f97\u5230\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u77ed\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u4e3aSAG\u548cSAGA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u975e\u51f8\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u91c7\u6837\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86IAG\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6700\u597d\u5df2\u77e5\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7b80\u5316\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8fd8\u4e3a\u7b97\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

To mitigate this, generative compression methods leveraging semantic priors from pretrained models have emerged as a promising paradigm.

Methods based on explicit representations preserve content structure but often lack fine-grained textures, whereas implicit methods can synthesize visually plausible details at the cost of semantic drift. In this work, we propose a unified framework that bridges this gap by coherently integrating explicit and implicit representations in a training-free manner. Specifically, We condition a diffusion model on explicit high-level semantics while employing reverse-channel coding to implicitly convey fine-grained details. Moreover, we introduce a plug-in encoder that enables flexible control of the distortion-perception tradeoff by modulating the implicit information.

However, the mechanistic realization of this behavior remains obscure, specifically how the model resolves these knowledge conflicts through compliance, and whether this suppression arises from signal magnitude dilution or directional geometric alteration within the residual stream. To resolve this, we conducted a layer-wise geometric analysis across Qwen-4B, Llama-3.1-8B, and GLM-4-9B, decomposing the residual stream updates induced by counter-factual contexts into radial (norm-based) and angular (cosine-based) components. Our empirical results reject the universality of the \"Manifold Dilution\" hypothesis, as two of the three architectures maintained stable residual norms despite exhibiting significant performance degradation on factual queries. Instead, we observed that compliance is consistently characterized by \"Orthogonal Interference,\" where the conflicting context injects a steering vector that is quasi-orthogonal to the ground-truth direction, effectively rotating the hidden state representation. This suggests that models do not \"unlearn\" or suppress the magnitude of internal truths but rather employ a mechanism of geometric displacement to bypass the correct unembedding vector, effectively simulating adoption while preserving the original structural magnitude. These findings challenge scalar confidence metrics for detecting hallucinations and underscore the necessity of vectorial monitoring to distinguish between genuine knowledge integration and superficial in-context mimicry.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86LLM\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u4e2d\u4f18\u5148\u5904\u7406\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u800c\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u91ca\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e45\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u4f4d\u79fb\uff08\u6b63\u4ea4\u5e72\u6270\uff09\u6765\u7ed5\u8fc7\u6b63\u786e\u89e3\u7801\u5411\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ecf\u5e38\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u800c\u975e\u9884\u5b58\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u88ab\u79f0\u4e3a\u987a\u4ece\u6027\u3002\u4f46\u5176\u673a\u5236\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u5f0f\u89e3\u51b3\u77e5\u8bc6\u51b2\u7a81\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9Qwen-4B\u7b49\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5c42\u95f4\u51e0\u4f55\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5c06\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d41\u66f4\u65b0\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5f84\u5411\uff08\u8303\u6570\uff09\u548c\u89d2\u5ea6\uff08\u4f59\u5f26\uff09\u5206\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u652f\u6301'\u6d41\u5f62\u7a00\u91ca'\u5047\u8bf4\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u53d1\u73b0\u987a\u4ece\u6027\u8868\u73b0\u4e3a'\u6b63\u4ea4\u5e72\u6270'\u2014\u2014\u51b2\u7a81\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6ce8\u5165\u7684\u8f6c\u5411\u5411\u91cf\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u65b9\u5411\u51c6\u6b63\u4ea4\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u65cb\u8f6c\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u8868\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u7528\u6807\u91cf\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u5411\u91cf\u76d1\u6d4b\u6765\u533a\u5206\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u548c\u8868\u9762\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6a21\u4eff\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u662f'\u5fd8\u8bb0'\u5185\u90e8\u771f\u7406\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u4f4d\u79fb\u6765\u56de\u907f\u6b63\u786e\u89e3\u7801\u3002"}}

In this work, we study the problem of synthesizing \\emph{robust neural Lyapunov barrier certificates} that maintain their guarantees under perturbations in system dynamics. We formally define a robust Lyapunov barrier function and specify sufficient conditions based on Lipschitz continuity that ensure robustness against bounded perturbations. We propose practical training objectives that enforce these conditions via adversarial training, Lipschitz neighborhood bound, and global Lipschitz regularization. We validate our approach in two practically relevant environments, Inverted Pendulum and 2D Docking. The former is a widely studied benchmark, while the latter is a safety-critical task in autonomous systems.

However, this approach fails to capture the event's semantic continuity and integrity, leading to ambiguities. To address this, we propose E.M.Ground, a novel Vid-LLM for TVG that focuses on holistic and coherent event perception. E.M.Ground introduces three key innovations: (i) a special <event> token that aggregates information from all frames of a query event, preserving semantic continuity for accurate event matching; (ii) Savitzky-Golay smoothing to reduce noise in token-to-frame similarities across timestamps, improving prediction accuracy; (iii) multi-grained frame feature aggregation to enhance matching reliability and temporal understanding, compensating for compression-induced information loss.

To reduce resource consumption and accelerate inference, it is essential to eliminate redundant parameters without compromising performance. However, conventional pruning methods that directly remove such parameters often lead to a dramatic drop in model performance in reasoning tasks, and require extensive post-training to recover the lost capabilities. In this work, we propose a gradual compacting method that divides the compression process into multiple fine-grained iterations, applying a Prune-Tune Loop (PTL) at each stage to incrementally reduce model size while restoring performance with finetuning. This iterative approach-reminiscent of the \"boiling frog\" effect-enables the model to be progressively compressed without abrupt performance loss. Experimental results show that PTL can compress LLMs to nearly half their original size with only lightweight post-training, while maintaining performance comparable to the original model on reasoning tasks. Moreover, PTL is flexible and can be applied to various pruning strategies, such as neuron pruning and layer pruning, as well as different post-training methods, including continual pre-training and reinforcement learning. Additionally, experimental results confirm the effectiveness of PTL on a variety of tasks beyond mathematical reasoning, such as code generation, demonstrating its broad applicability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While classical results characterize the phase transition for exact recovery based solely on graph connectivity, many real-world networks contain additional data, such as node attributes or labels.

Hydraulic cylinders, as actuators in these systems, apply force and position through the displacement of hydraulic fluid, but their operation is significantly influenced by friction force. Achieving precision in hydraulic cylinders requires an accurate friction model under various operating conditions. Existing analytical models, often derived from experimental tests, necessitate the identification or estimation of influencing factors but are limited in adaptability and computational efficiency. This research introduces a data-driven, hybrid algorithm based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Random Forests for nonlinear friction force estimation. The algorithm effectively combines feature detection and estimation processes using training data acquired from an experimental hydraulic test setup. It achieves a consistent and stable model error of less than 10% across diverse operating conditions and external load variations, ensuring robust performance in complex situations. The computational cost of the algorithm is 1.51 milliseconds per estimation, making it suitable for real-time applications. The proposed method addresses the limitations of analytical models by delivering high precision and computational efficiency. The algorithm's performance is validated through detailed analysis and experimental results, including direct comparisons with the LuGre model. The comparison highlights that while the LuGre model offers a theoretical foundation for friction modeling, its performance is limited by its inability to dynamically adjust to varying operational conditions of the hydraulic cylinder, further emphasizing the advantages of the proposed hybrid approach in real-time applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Typical methods first establish few-shot capability in a large-scale source domain and then adapt it to target domains.

Moreover, the source-trained model's initially weak few-shot capability in target domains, coupled with substantial domain gaps, severely hinders the effective utilization of target samples and further impedes adaptation. To this end, we propose Multi-view Progressive Adaptation, which progressively adapts few-shot capability to target domains from both data and strategy perspectives. (i) From the data perspective, we introduce Hybrid Progressive Augmentation, which progressively generates more diverse and complex views through cumulative strong augmentations, thereby creating increasingly challenging learning scenarios. (ii) From the strategy perspective, we design Dual-chain Multi-view Prediction, which fully leverages these progressively complex views through sequential and parallel learning paths under extensive supervision. By jointly enforcing prediction consistency across diverse and complex views, MPA achieves both robust and accurate adaptation to target domains.

Most previous multimodal models are trained on perfectly paired multimodal input to reach optimal performance. In real-world deployments, however, the presence of modality is highly variable and unpredictable, causing the pre-trained models in suffering significant performance drops and fail to remain robust with dynamic missing modalities circumstances. In this paper, we present a novel Cyclic INformative Learning framework (CyIN) to bridge the gap between complete and incomplete multimodal learning. Specifically, we firstly build an informative latent space by adopting token- and label-level Information Bottleneck (IB) cyclically among various modalities. Capturing task-related features with variational approximation, the informative bottleneck latents are purified for more efficient cross-modal interaction and multimodal fusion. Moreover, to supplement the missing information caused by incomplete multimodal input, we propose cross-modal cyclic translation by reconstruct the missing modalities with the remained ones through forward and reverse propagation process. With the help of the extracted and reconstructed informative latents, CyIN succeeds in jointly optimizing complete and incomplete multimodal learning in one unified model. Extensive experiments on 4 multimodal datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method in both complete and diverse incomplete scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

These SAM-based methods typically rely on point matching between reference and target images and use the matched dense points as prompts for mask prediction. However, we observe that dense points perform poorly in Cross-Domain Few-Shot Segmentation (CD-FSS), where target images are from medical or satellite domains. We attribute this issue to large domain shifts that disrupt the point-image interactions learned by SAM, and find that point density plays a crucial role under such conditions. To address this challenge, we propose Conditional Point Sparsification (CPS), a training-free approach that adaptively guides SAM interactions for cross-domain images based on reference exemplars.

While recent AVQA models have high accuracy, their ability to identify when they are likely wrong and their consequent abstention from answering remain underexplored areas of research. To fill this gap, we explore several approaches and then propose Adaptive Confidence Refinement (ACR), a lightweight method to further enhance the performance of $\\mathcal{R}$-AVQA. Our key insight is that the Maximum Softmax Probability (MSP) is Bayes-optimal only under strong calibration, a condition usually not met in deep neural networks, particularly in multimodal models. Instead of replacing MSP, our ACR maintains it as a primary confidence signal and applies input-adaptive residual corrections when MSP is deemed unreliable. ACR introduces two learned heads: i) a Residual Risk Head that predicts low-magnitude correctness residuals that MSP does not capture, and ii) a Confidence Gating Head to determine MSP trustworthiness. Our experiments and theoretical analysis show that ACR consistently outperforms existing methods on in- and out-of-disrtibution, and data bias settings across three different AVQA architectures, establishing a solid foundation for $\\mathcal{R}$-AVQA task.

However, existing activation steering methods rely on static control vectors that fail to adapt to the non-stationary evolution of complex reasoning tasks. To address this limitation, we propose STIR (Self-Distilled Tools for Internal Reasoning), a framework that reformulates reasoning enhancement as a dynamic latent trajectory control problem. STIR introduces a synergistic three-stage pipeline: (1) differential intrinsic action induction harvests latent reasoning successes to crystallize steering primitives; (2) sparse control basis construction curates a compact, geometrically diverse tool library; and (3) value-modulated trajectory intervention dynamically injects context-specific impulses via anchor-based gating. Extensive experiments on six arithmetic and logical benchmarks across four representative models demonstrate that STIR improves average accuracy by 1.9% to 7.5% while reducing average token consumption by up to 35% compared to vanilla decoding. These findings demonstrate that the benefits of explicit chain-of-thought can be realized through dynamic latent trajectory control, internalizing the reasoning process to bypass the explicit generation while achieving superior fidelity.

However, existing benchmarks suffer from severe data contamination and a lack of scene specificity, inadequate for assessing agent capabilities in unseen settings. To address this, we propose a dynamic in-situ task generation method for unseen environments inspired by human cognition. We define tasks through a structured graph representation and construct a two-stage interaction-evolution task generation system for embodied agents (TEA). In the interaction stage, the agent actively interacts with the environment, creating a loop between task execution and generation that allows for continuous task generation. In the evolution stage, task graph modeling allows us to recombine and reuse existing tasks to generate new ones without external data. Experiments across 10 unseen scenes demonstrate that TEA automatically generated 87,876 tasks in two cycles, which human verification confirmed to be physically reasonable and encompassing essential daily cognitive capabilities. Benchmarking SOTA models against humans on our in-situ tasks reveals that models, despite excelling on public benchmarks, perform surprisingly poorly on basic perception tasks, severely lack 3D interaction awareness and show high sensitivity to task types in reasoning.

This new bound leads directly to recos, a similarity metric that normalizes the dot product by the sorted vector components. recos relaxes the condition for perfect similarity from strict linear dependence to ordinal concordance, thereby capturing a broader class of relationships. Extensive experiments across 11 embedding models--spanning static, contextualized, and universal types--demonstrate that recos consistently outperforms traditional cosine similarity, achieving higher correlation with human judgments on standard Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) benchmarks.

Among PTQ methods, GPTQ has gained significant attention for its efficiency, enabling billion-scale LLMs to be quantized within a few GPU hours. However, GPTQ's assumption of layer-wise independence leads to severe accuracy drops in low-bit regimes. Recently, BoA improved upon GPTQ by incorporating inter-layer dependencies within attention modules, but its reliance on sequential quantization across all out-channels makes it substantially less efficient. In this paper, we propose TurboBoA, a new backpropagation-free PTQ algorithm that preserves the accuracy benefits of BoA while significantly accelerating the process. The proposed TurboBoA introduces three key innovations: (i) joint quantization of multiple out-channels with a closed-form error compensation rule, which reduces sequential bottlenecks and yields more than a three-fold speedup; (ii) a correction mechanism for errors propagated from preceding quantized layers; and (iii) adaptive grid computation with coordinate descent refinement to maintain alignment during iterative updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TurboBoA delivers substantial acceleration over BoA while consistently improving accuracy.

However, their unreliability and tendency to hallucinate remain significant challenges. In this paper, we address these challenges by introducing a principled framework for using an LLM as decision support in security management. Our framework integrates the LLM in an iterative loop where it generates candidate actions that are checked for consistency with system constraints and lookahead predictions. When consistency is low, we abstain from the generated actions and instead collect external feedback, e.g., by evaluating actions in a digital twin. This feedback is then used to refine the candidate actions through in-context learning (ICL). We prove that this design allows to control the hallucination risk by tuning the consistency threshold. Moreover, we establish a bound on the regret of ICL under certain assumptions. To evaluate our framework, we apply it to an incident response use case where the goal is to generate a response and recovery plan based on system logs. Experiments on four public datasets show that our framework reduces recovery times by up to 30% compared to frontier LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We argue that the primary challenge in FSCIL is not feature acquisition, but rather the optimization of decision regions within a static, high-quality feature space. To this end, we introduce an efficient prototype fine-tuning framework that evolves static centroids into dynamic, learnable components. The framework employs a dual-calibration method consisting of class-specific and task-aware offsets. These components function synergistically to improve the discriminative capacity of prototypes for ongoing incremental classes. Extensive results demonstrate that our method attains superior performance across multiple benchmarks while requiring minimal learnable parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Traditional methods such as collaborative filtering and content-based filtering suffer from data sparsity and over-specialization. To alleviate these limitations, graph-based approaches have been proposed; however, they still rely heavily on manually predefined metapaths, which often capture only superficial structural relationships and impose substantial burdens on domain experts as well as significant engineering costs. To overcome these limitations, we propose AMR (Aspect-aware MOOC Recommendation), a novel framework that models path-specific multiple aspects by embedding the semantic content of nodes within each metapath. AMR automatically discovers metapaths through bi-directional walks, derives aspect-aware path representations using a bi-LSTM-based encoder, and incorporates these representations as edge features in the learner-learner and KC-KC subgraphs to achieve fine-grained semantically informed KC recommendations. Extensive experiments on the large-scale MOOCCube and PEEK datasets show that AMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural network baselines across key metrics such as HR@K and nDCG@K.

We identify an underexplored property of block diffusion: cross-step redundancy of attention within a block. Our analysis shows that attention outputs from tokens outside the current block remain largely stable across diffusion steps, while block-internal attention varies significantly. Based on this observation, we propose FlashBlock, a cached block-external attention mechanism that reuses stable attention output, reducing attention computation and KV cache access without modifying the diffusion process. Moreover, FlashBlock is orthogonal to sparse attention and can be combined as a complementary residual reuse strategy, substantially improving model accuracy under aggressive sparsification.

While perspective foundation models have achieved success through data scaling, directly adapting them to the panoramic domain often fails due to severe geometric distortions and coordinate system discrepancies. Furthermore, the underlying relations between diverse dense prediction tasks in spherical spaces are underexplored. To address these challenges, we propose MTPano, a robust multi-task panoramic foundation model established by a label-free training pipeline. First, to circumvent data scarcity, we leverage powerful perspective dense priors. We project panoramic images into perspective patches to generate accurate, domain-gap-free pseudo-labels using off-the-shelf foundation models, which are then re-projected to serve as patch-wise supervision. Second, to tackle the interference between task types, we categorize tasks into rotation-invariant (e.g., depth, segmentation) and rotation-variant (e.g., surface normals) groups. We introduce the Panoramic Dual BridgeNet, which disentangles these feature streams via geometry-aware modulation layers that inject absolute position and ray direction priors. To handle the distortion from equirectangular projections (ERP), we incorporate ERP token mixers followed by a dual-branch BridgeNet for interactions with gradient truncation, facilitating beneficial cross-task information sharing while blocking conflicting gradients from incompatible task attributes. Additionally, we introduce auxiliary tasks (image gradient, point map, etc.) to fertilize the cross-task learning process.

However, transferring capabilities learned with PI to policies that must act without it at inference time remains a fundamental challenge. We study this problem in the context of distilling frontier models for multi-turn agentic environments, where closed-source systems typically hide their internal reasoning and expose only action trajectories. This breaks standard distillation pipelines, since successful behavior is observable but the reasoning process is not. For this, we introduce \u03c0-Distill, a joint teacher-student objective that trains a PI-conditioned teacher and an unconditioned student simultaneously using the same model. Additionally, we also introduce On-Policy Self-Distillation (OPSD), an alternative approach that trains using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a reverse KL-penalty between the student and the PI-conditioned teacher.

Across both closed and open models, agents typically navigate to relevant pages but retrieve decisive hidden evidence in only a small fraction of cases. When tasks require overturning misleading surface-level signals, performance drops sharply to near chance accuracy. Agents frequently hallucinate investigative reasoning by claiming to rely on evidence they never accessed. Even when correct context is discovered, agents often fail to integrate it into their final decision. Providing more explicit instructions improves context discovery but often reduces overall accuracy, revealing a tradeoff between procedural compliance and effective judgement. Together, these results show that current web agent architectures lack reliable mechanisms for adaptive investigation, evidence integration, and judgement override.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing concept erasure approaches primarily focus on removing unsafe concepts without providing guidance toward corresponding safe alternatives, which often leads to failure in preserving the structural and semantic consistency between the original and erased generations. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, PAIRed Erasing (PAIR), which reframes concept erasure from simple removal to consistency-preserving semantic realignment using unsafe-safe pairs. We first generate safe counterparts from unsafe inputs while preserving structural and semantic fidelity, forming paired unsafe-safe multimodal data. Leveraging these pairs, we introduce two key components: (1) Paired Semantic Realignment, a guided objective that uses unsafe-safe pairs to explicitly map target concepts to semantically aligned safe anchors; and (2) Fisher-weighted Initialization for DoRA, which initializes parameter-efficient low-rank adaptation matrices using unsafe-safe pairs, encouraging the generation of safe alternatives while selectively suppressing unsafe concepts. Together, these components enable fine-grained erasure that removes only the targeted concepts while maintaining overall semantic consistency.

Residual binarization enables hardware-friendly, matmul-free inference by stacking binary ($\\pm$1) layers, but is plagued by pathological feature co-adaptation. We identify a key failure mode, which we term inter-path adaptation: during quantization-aware training (QAT), parallel residual binary paths learn redundant features, degrading the error-compensation structure and limiting the expressive capacity of the model. While prior work relies on heuristic workarounds (e.g., path freezing) that constrain the solution space, we propose RaBiT, a novel quantization framework that resolves co-adaptation by algorithmically enforcing a residual hierarchy. Its core mechanism sequentially derives each binary path from a single shared full-precision weight, which ensures that every path corrects the error of the preceding one. This process is stabilized by a robust initialization that prioritizes functional preservation over mere weight approximation. RaBiT redefines the 2-bit accuracy-efficiency frontier: it achieves state-of-the-art performance, rivals even hardware-intensive Vector Quantization (VQ) methods, and delivers a $4.49\\times$ inference speed-up over full-precision models on an RTX 4090.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing prototype-based representation learning methods have demonstrated exceptional performance. Specifically, we identify two fundamental flaws that universally constrain these methods: the Static Homogeneity Assumption (fixed representational resources for all classes) and the Learning-Inference Disconnect (discarding rich prototype quality knowledge at inference). These flaws fundamentally limit the model's capacity and performance. To address these issues, we propose APEX (Adaptive Prototype for eXtensive OOD Detection), a novel OOD detection framework designed via a Two-Stage Repair process to optimize the learned feature manifold. APEX introduces two key innovations to address these respective flaws: (1) an Adaptive Prototype Manifold (APM), which leverages the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle to automatically determine the optimal prototype complexity $K_c^*$ for each class, thereby fundamentally resolving prototype collision; and (2) a Posterior-Aware OOD Scoring (PAOS) mechanism, which quantifies prototype quality (cohesion and separation) to bridge the learning-inference disconnect. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks such as CIFAR-100 validate the superiority of our method, where APEX achieves new state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86APEX\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u539f\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e24\u5927\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u9759\u6001\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u548c\u5b66\u4e60-\u63a8\u65ad\u65ad\u5f00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u539f\u578b\u540e\u5904\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u539f\u578b\u7684OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6839\u672c\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a1\uff09\u9759\u6001\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u5047\u8bbe - \u4e3a\u6240\u6709\u7c7b\u522b\u5206\u914d\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u8868\u793a\u8d44\u6e90\uff1b2\uff09\u5b66\u4e60-\u63a8\u65ad\u65ad\u5f00 - \u5728\u63a8\u65ad\u65f6\u4e22\u5f03\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u539f\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f3a\u9677\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bb9\u91cf\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAPEX\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u9879\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u539f\u578b\u6d41\u5f62 - \u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5c0f\u63cf\u8ff0\u957f\u5ea6\u539f\u7406\u81ea\u52a8\u786e\u5b9a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u539f\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6K_c*\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u539f\u578b\u78b0\u649e\u95ee\u9898\uff1b2\uff09\u540e\u9a8c\u611f\u77e5OOD\u8bc4\u5206\u673a\u5236 - \u91cf\u5316\u539f\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\uff08\u5185\u805a\u6027\u548c\u5206\u79bb\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u8fde\u63a5\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u63a8\u65ad\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-100\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\uff0cAPEX\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "APEX\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u539f\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We attribute this phenomenon to Semantic Hegemony within the deep feature space and reveal its mathematical essence through the lens of Neural Collapse. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that the spectral concentration bias, induced by the high variance of the principal subspace, numerically masks the structural distribution shift signals that should be significant in the residual subspace. To address this issue, we propose D-KNN, a training-free, plug-and-play geometric decoupling framework. This method utilizes orthogonal decomposition to explicitly separate semantic components from structural residuals and introduces a dual-space calibration mechanism to reactivate the model's sensitivity to weak residual signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D-KNN effectively breaks Semantic Hegemony, establishing new SOTA performance on both CIFAR and ImageNet benchmarks.

In this work, we systematically re-evaluate four representative LoRA variants alongside vanilla LoRA through extensive hyperparameter searches. Across mathematical and code generation tasks on diverse model scales, we find that different LoRA methods favor distinct learning rate ranges. Crucially, once learning rates are properly tuned, all methods achieve similar peak performance (within 1-2%), with only subtle rank-dependent behaviors. These results suggest that vanilla LoRA remains a competitive baseline and that improvements reported under single training configuration may not reflect consistent methodological advantages.

In this work, we introduce CityGenAgent, a natural language-driven framework for hierarchical procedural generation of high-quality 3D cities. Our approach decomposes city generation into two interpretable components, Block Program and Building Program. To ensure structural correctness and semantic alignment, we adopt a two-stage learning strategy: (1) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT).

We study reward guidance for discrete diffusion language models, where one cannot differentiate through the natural outputs of the model because they are discrete tokens. Existing approaches either replace these discrete tokens with continuous relaxations, or employ techniques like the straight-through estimator. In this work, we show the downsides of both these methods. The former degrades gradient feedback because the reward model has never been trained with continuous inputs. The latter involves incorrect optimization because the gradient evaluated at discrete tokens is used to update continuous logits. Our key innovation is to go beyond this tradeoff by introducing a novel mechanism called EntRGi: Entropy aware Reward Guidance that dynamically regulates the gradients from the reward model. By modulating the continuous relaxation using the model's confidence, our approach substantially improves reward guidance while providing reliable inputs to the reward model. We empirically validate our approach on a 7B-parameter diffusion language model across 3 diverse reward models and 3 multi-skill benchmarks, showing consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Beyond the traditional triplet representation of facts where a relation connects two entities, modern KGs observe an increasing number of hyper-relational facts, where an arbitrary number of qualifiers associated with a triplet provide auxiliary information to further describe the rich semantics of the triplet, which can effectively boost the reasoning performance in link prediction tasks. However, existing link prediction techniques over such hyper-relational KGs (HKGs) mostly focus on a transductive setting, where KG embedding models are learned from the specific vocabulary of a given KG and subsequently can only make predictions within the same vocabulary, limiting their generalizability to previously unseen vocabularies. Against this background, we propose THOR, an inducTive link prediction technique for Hyper-relational knOwledge gRaphs. Specifically, we first introduce both relation and entity foundation graphs, modeling their fundamental inter- and intra-fact interactions in HKGs, which are agnostic to any specific relations and entities. Afterward, THOR is designed to learn from the two foundation graphs with two parallel graph encoders followed by a transformer decoder, which supports efficient masked training and fully-inductive inference. We conduct a thorough evaluation of THOR in hyper-relational link prediction tasks on 12 datasets with different settings. Results show that THOR outperforms a sizable collection of baselines, yielding 66.1%, 55.9%, and 20.4% improvement over the best-performing rule-based, semi-inductive, and fully-inductive techniques, respectively.

To ensure robust learning and prevent catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a ranked preference mixup strategy that carefully balances exploration with adherence to initial human priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAIL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks while using merely 6\\% of the preference data required by existing approaches, revealing that diffusion models possess remarkable self-improvement capabilities that, when properly harnessed, can effectively replace both large-scale human annotation and external reward models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Supplementary material is included at the end of the main paper (16 pages, 15 figures, 2 tables)", "summary": "Graphical User Interface (GUI) agent is pivotal to advancing intelligent human-computer interaction paradigms. Constructing powerful GUI agents necessitates the large-scale annotation of high-quality user-behavior trajectory data (i.e., intent-trajectory pairs) for training. However, manual annotation methods and current GUI agent data mining approaches typically face three critical challenges: high construction cost, poor data quality, and low data richness. To address these issues, we propose M$^2$-Miner, the first low-cost and automated mobile GUI agent data-mining framework based on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). For better data mining efficiency and quality, we present a collaborative multi-agent framework, comprising InferAgent, OrchestraAgent, and JudgeAgent for guidance, acceleration, and evaluation. To further enhance the efficiency of mining and enrich intent diversity, we design an intent recycling strategy to extract extra valuable interaction trajectories.

To this end, we introduce VRIQ (Visual Reasoning IQ), a novel benchmark designed to assess and analyze the visual reasoning ability of VLMs. We evaluate models on two sets of tasks: abstract puzzle-style and natural-image reasoning tasks. We find that on abstract puzzles, performance remains near random with an average accuracy of around 28%, while natural tasks yield better but still weak results with 45% accuracy. We also find that tool-augmented reasoning demonstrates only modest improvements. To uncover the source of this weakness, we introduce diagnostic probes targeting perception and reasoning. Our analysis demonstrates that around 56% of failures arise from perception alone, 43% from both perception and reasoning, and only a mere 1% from reasoning alone. This motivates us to design fine-grained diagnostic probe questions targeting specific perception categories (e.g., shape, count, position, 3D/depth), revealing that certain categories cause more failures than others. Our benchmark and analysis establish that current VLMs, even with visual reasoning tools, remain unreliable abstract reasoners, mostly due to perception limitations, and offer a principled basis for improving visual reasoning in multimodal systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing differential privacy (DP) approaches to ICL are either computationally expensive or rely on heuristics with limited effectiveness, including context oversampling, synthetic data generation, or unnecessary thresholding.

Traditional statistical and deep learning (DL) models often struggle to capture complex temporal dependencies and integrate heterogeneous data effectively. While time series foundation models (TSFMs) have shown strong performance in general time series forecasting tasks, such as traffic forecasting and weather forecasting. However, their effectiveness in day-ahead EPF, particularly in volatile markets, remains underexplored. This paper presents a spike regularization strategy and evaluates a wide range of TSFMs, including Tiny Time Mixers (TTMs), MOIRAI, MOMENT, and TimesFM, against traditional statistical and DL models such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long-short Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network - LSTM (CNN-LSTM) using half-hourly wholesale market data with volatile trends in Singapore. Exogenous factors (e.g. weather and calendar variables) are also incorporated into models where applicable. Results demonstrate that TSFMs consistently outperform traditional approaches, achieving up to 37.4% improvement in MAPE across various evaluation settings.

However, the field remains fragmented across dozens of specialized models with varying strengths, forcing users to navigate complex model selection and limiting system scalability. Moreover, existing two-stage approaches depend on axis-aligned bounding boxes for layout detection, failing to handle distorted or photographed documents effectively. To this end, we present Dolphin-v2, a two-stage document image parsing model that substantially improves upon the original Dolphin. In the first stage, Dolphin-v2 jointly performs document type classification (digital-born versus photographed) alongside layout analysis. For digital-born documents, it conducts finer-grained element detection with reading order prediction. In the second stage, we employ a hybrid parsing strategy: photographed documents are parsed holistically as complete pages to handle geometric distortions, while digital-born documents undergo element-wise parallel parsing guided by the detected layout anchors, enabling efficient content extraction. Compared with the original Dolphin, Dolphin-v2 introduces several crucial enhancements: (1) robust parsing of photographed documents via holistic page-level understanding, (2) finer-grained element detection (21 categories) with semantic attribute extraction such as author information and document metadata, and (3) code block recognition with indentation preservation, which existing systems typically lack. Comprehensive evaluations are conducted on DocPTBench, OmniDocBench, and our self-constructed RealDoc-160 benchmark.

This reliance on external, impoverished signals prevents models from developing a deep, self-contained understanding of reasoning principles. We introduce \\textbf{ALIVE} (\\emph{Adversarial Learning with Instructive Verbal Evaluation}), a hands-free alignment framework that moves beyond scalar reward optimization toward intrinsic reasoning acquisition. Grounded in the principle of \\emph{Cognitive Synergy}, ALIVE unifies problem posing, solving, and judging within a single policy model to internalize the logic of correctness. By coupling adversarial learning with instructive verbal feedback, ALIVE enables models to internalize evaluative criteria directly from raw corpora, effectively transforming external critiques into an endogenous reasoning faculty. Empirical evaluations across mathematical reasoning, code generation, and general logical inference benchmarks demonstrate that ALIVE consistently mitigates reward signal limitations. With identical data and compute, it achieves accuracy gains, markedly improved cross-domain generalization, and higher self-correction rates. These results indicate that the reasoning trinity fosters a self-sustaining trajectory of capability growth, positioning ALIVE as a scalable foundation for general-purpose reasoning alignment without human-in-the-loop supervision.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, this batch-level formulation requires loading thousands of real images and applying multiple rounds of differentiable augmentations to synthetic images at each distillation step, leading to substantial computational and memory overhead. In this paper, we introduce statistical flow matching , a stable and efficient supervised learning framework that optimizes synthetic images by aligning constant statistical flows from target class centers to non-target class centers in the original data. Our approach loads raw statistics only once and performs a single augmentation pass on the synthetic data, achieving performance comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art methods with 10x lower GPU memory usage and 4x shorter runtime.

Predicting compound-protein interactions (CPIs) is a critical component in this process, enabling the identification of molecular interactions between drug candidates and target proteins. Recent deep learning methods have successfully modeled CPIs at the atomic level, achieving improved efficiency and accuracy over traditional energy-based approaches. However, these models do not always align with chemical realities, as molecular fragments (motifs or functional groups) typically serve as the primary units of biological recognition and binding. In this paper, we propose Phi-former, a pairwise hierarchical interaction representation learning method that addresses this gap by incorporating the biological role of motifs in CPIs. Phi-former represents compounds and proteins hierarchically and employs a pairwise pre-training framework to model interactions systematically across atom-atom, motif-motif, and atom-motif levels, reflecting how biological systems recognize molecular partners. We design intra-level and inter-level learning pipelines that make different interaction levels mutually beneficial. Experimental results demonstrate that Phi-former achieves superior performance on CPI-related tasks.

However, many derived features (e.g., \"second-order moment\") remain difficult to interpret, especially across different clinical contexts, which limits their practical adoption. Conditional diffusion models show promise for explainability through feature editing, but they typically assume feature independence**--**an assumption violated by intrinsically correlated pathomics features. Consequently, editing one feature while fixing others can push the model off the biological manifold and produce unrealistic artifacts. To address this, we propose a Manifold-Aware Diffusion (MAD) framework for controllable and biologically plausible cell nuclei editing. Unlike existing approaches, our method regularizes feature trajectories within a disentangled latent space learned by a variational auto-encoder (VAE). This ensures that manipulating a target feature automatically adjusts correlated attributes to remain within the learned distribution of real cells.

This process involves disentangling high-level latent variables and their causal relationships from low-level observations. Previous work in this area that achieves identifiability typically focuses on cases where the observations are either i.i.d. or follow a latent discrete-time process. Nevertheless, many real-world settings require identifying latent variables that are continuous-time stochastic processes (e.g., multivariate point processes). To this end, we develop identifiable causal representation learning for continuous-time latent stochastic point processes. We study its identifiability by analyzing the geometry of the parameter space. Furthermore, we develop MUTATE, an identifiable variational autoencoder framework with a time-adaptive transition module to infer stochastic dynamics. Across simulated and empirical studies, we find that MUTATE can effectively answer scientific questions, such as the accumulation of mutations in genomics and the mechanisms driving neuron spike triggers in response to time-varying dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u6f5c\u5728\u968f\u673a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8fa8\u8bc6\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6MUTATE\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u5982\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u7a81\u53d8\u79ef\u7d2f\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u653e\u7535\u89e6\u53d1\u7b49\u975ei.i.d.\u65f6\u53d8\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u8bb8\u591a\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u6c14\u5019\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u3001\u7269\u7406\u5b66\uff09\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u4f4e\u7ef4\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8fa8\u8bc6\u51fa\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u968f\u673a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08\u5982\u591a\u5143\u70b9\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5148\u524d\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8i.i.d.\u6216\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u968f\u673a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u6f5c\u5728\u968f\u673a\u70b9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8fa8\u8bc6\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86MUTATE\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u4e2a\u5e26\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8f6c\u79fb\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u53ef\u8fa8\u8bc6\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63a8\u65ad\u968f\u673a\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u57fa\u56e0\u7ec4\u7a81\u53d8\u79ef\u7d2f\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\u653e\u7535\u89e6\u53d1\u673a\u5236\uff09\uff0cMUTATE\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u56de\u7b54\u76f8\u5173\u79d1\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6210\u529f\u5730\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u56e0\u679c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u968f\u673a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u975ei.i.d.\u7684\u65f6\u53d8\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u8fa8\u8bc6\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u79d1\u5b66\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Speculative decoding reduces latency using a lightweight draft model, but deployment is often limited by the cost and complexity of acquiring, tuning, and maintaining an effective draft model. Recent approaches usually require auxiliary training or specialization, and even training-free methods incur costly search or optimization. We propose SDFP, a fully training-free and plug-and-play framework that builds the draft model via Fisher Information Trace (FIT)-based layer pruning of a given LLM. Using layer sensitivity as a proxy for output perturbation, SDFP removes low-impact layers to obtain a compact draft while preserving compatibility with the original model for standard speculative verification. SDFP needs no additional training, hyperparameter tuning, or separately maintained drafts, enabling rapid, deployment-friendly draft construction. Across benchmarks, SDFP delivers 1.32x-1.5x decoding speedup without altering the target model's output distribution, supporting low-latency multimedia applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Graph self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a growing toolbox of pretext objectives: mutual information, reconstruction, contrastive learning; yet combining them reliably remains a challenge due to objective interference and training instability. Most multi-pretext pipelines use per-update mixing, forcing every parameter update to be a compromise, leading to three failure modes: Disagreement (conflict-induced negative transfer), Drift (nonstationary objective utility), and Drought (hidden starvation of underserved objectives). We argue that coordination is fundamentally a temporal allocation problem: deciding when each objective receives optimization budget, not merely how to weigh them. We introduce ControlG, a control-theoretic framework that recasts multi-objective graph SSL as feedback-controlled temporal allocation by estimating per-objective difficulty and pairwise antagonism, planning target budgets via a Pareto-aware log-hypervolume planner, and scheduling with a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller.

However, existing resources provide limited ameloblastoma coverage and lack the format consistency needed for direct model training. We present a newly curated multimodal dataset specifically focused on ameloblastoma, integrating annotated radiological, histopathological, and intraoral clinical images with structured data derived from case reports. Natural language processing techniques were employed to extract clinically relevant features from textual reports, while image data underwent domain specific preprocessing and augmentation. Using this dataset, a multimodal deep learning model was developed to classify ameloblastoma variants, assess behavioral patterns such as recurrence risk, and support surgical planning.

Current state-of-the-art (sota) methods typically employ Outlier Exposure (OE) strategies, relying on large-scale real external datasets (such as 80 Million Tiny Images) to regularize the feature space. However, this dependence on external data often becomes infeasible in practical deployment due to high data acquisition costs and privacy sensitivity. To this end, we propose a novel data-free framework aimed at completely eliminating reliance on external datasets while maintaining superior detection performance. We introduce a Geometry-guided virtual Outlier Synthesis (GOS) strategy that models statistical properties using the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution on a hypersphere. Specifically, we locate a low-likelihood annulus in the feature space and perform directional sampling of virtual outliers in this region. Simultaneously, we introduce a new Dual-Granularity Semantic Loss (DGS) that utilizes contrastive learning to maximize the distinction between in-distribution (ID) features and these synthesized boundary outliers. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as CIFAR-LT demonstrate that our method outperforms sota approaches that utilize external real images.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u6570\u636e\u6846\u67b6GOS\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7vMF\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u4f4e\u4f3c\u7136\u73af\u5f62\u533a\u57df\u5408\u6210\u865a\u62df\u79bb\u7fa4\u70b9\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408DSL\u635f\u5931\u589e\u5f3aID\u4e0e\u79bb\u7fa4\u70b9\u7684\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dOOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u6210\u672c\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4f7f\u5f97\u8fd9\u79cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u51e0\u4f55\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u865a\u62df\u79bb\u7fa4\u70b9\u5408\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528vMF\u5206\u5e03\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f4e\u4f3c\u7136\u73af\u5f62\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u751f\u6210\u865a\u62df\u79bb\u7fa4\u70b9\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u5927\u5316ID\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u8fb9\u754c\u79bb\u7fa4\u70b9\u7684\u533a\u5206\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-LT\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u65e0\u9700\u5916\u90e8\u771f\u5b9e\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f9d\u8d56\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GOS\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\u4e0bOOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bf9\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u865a\u62df\u79bb\u7fa4\u70b9\u5408\u6210\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u65e0\u6570\u636eOOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

One common challenge that arises in this setting is the out-of-distribution (OOD) error, which occurs when the policy leaves the training distribution. Prior methods penalize a statistical distance term to keep the policy close to the behavior policy, but this constrains policy improvement and may not completely prevent OOD actions. Another challenge is that the optimal policy distribution can be multimodal and difficult to represent. Recent works apply diffusion or flow policies to address this problem, but it is unclear how to avoid OOD errors while retaining policy expressiveness. We propose ReFORM, an offline RL method based on flow policies that enforces the less restrictive support constraint by construction. ReFORM learns a behavior cloning (BC) flow policy with a bounded source distribution to capture the support of the action distribution, then optimizes a reflected flow that generates bounded noise for the BC flow while keeping the support, to maximize the performance. Across 40 challenging tasks from the OGBench benchmark with datasets of varying quality and using a constant set of hyperparameters for all tasks, ReFORM dominates all baselines with hand-tuned hyperparameters on the performance profile curves.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Standard auditing techniques fall short: black-box methods often cannot distinguish misaligned outputs from benign ones, and mechanistic interpretability does not scale with model capabilities. We introduce Split Personality Training (SPT), which fine-tunes a second ``honest persona'' into LoRA parameters that remain inactive during normal operation. After the main model responds, we activate the LoRA adapter and insert a trigger string, enabling the honest persona to review the response while accessing the main model's latent states.

Existing methods based on contour detection and distance mapping still face significant challenges in processing complex and dense cellular regions. Graph coloring-based methods provide a new paradigm for this task, yet the effectiveness of this paradigm in real-world scenarios with dense overlaps and complex topologies has not been verified. Addressing this issue, we release a large-scale dataset GBC-FS 2025, which contains highly complex and dense sub-cellular nuclear arrangements. We conduct the first systematic analysis of the chromatic properties of cell adjacency graphs across four diverse datasets and reveal an important discovery: most real-world cell graphs are non-bipartite, with a high prevalence of odd-length cycles (predominantly triangles). This makes simple 2-coloring theory insufficient for handling complex tissues, while higher-chromaticity models would cause representational redundancy and optimization difficulties. Building on this observation of complex real-world contexts, we propose Disco (Densely-overlapping Cell Instance Segmentation via Adjacency-aware COllaborative Coloring), an adjacency-aware framework based on the \"divide and conquer\" principle. It uniquely combines a data-driven topological labeling strategy with a constrained deep learning system to resolve complex adjacency conflicts. First, \"Explicit Marking\" strategy transforms the topological challenge into a learnable classification task by recursively decomposing the cell graph and isolating a \"conflict set.\" Second, \"Implicit Disambiguation\" mechanism resolves ambiguities in conflict regions by enforcing feature dissimilarity between different instances, enabling the model to learn separable feature representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u75c5\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u5bc6\u96c6\u91cd\u53e0\u7ec6\u80de\u7684\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u90bb\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u534f\u4f5c\u56fe\u7740\u8272\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5Disco\uff0c\u5e76\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u590d\u6742\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7ec6\u80de\u6838\u6570\u636e\u96c6GBC-FS 2025", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6e\u5ed3\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8ddd\u79bb\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u590d\u6742\u7ec6\u80de\u533a\u57df\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u7740\u8272\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5bc6\u96c6\u91cd\u53e0\u548c\u590d\u6742\u62d3\u6251\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u9a8c\u8bc1", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5bf9\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u80de\u90bb\u63a5\u56fe\u7684\u8272\u5ea6\u7279\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u591a\u6570\u771f\u5b9e\u7ec6\u80de\u56fe\u662f\u975e\u4e8c\u5206\u56fe\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u5947\u6570\u957f\u5ea6\u5faa\u73af\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\"\u5206\u6cbb\"\u539f\u5219\u7684Disco\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\"\u663e\u5f0f\u6807\u8bb0\"\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u62d3\u6251\u6311\u6218\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9012\u5f52\u5206\u89e3\u7ec6\u80de\u56fe\u5e76\u9694\u79bb\"\u51b2\u7a81\u96c6\"\uff1b\"\u9690\u5f0f\u6d88\u9664\u6b67\u4e49\"\u673a\u5236\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5236\u4e0d\u540c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u95f4\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u5dee\u5f02\u6027\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u51b2\u7a81\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6b67\u4e49", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7ec6\u80de\u90bb\u63a5\u56fe\u7684\u975e\u4e8c\u5206\u7279\u6027\uff08\u9ad8\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7684\u5947\u957f\u73af\u4e09\u89d2\u5f62\uff09\u8868\u660e\u7b80\u53552\u7740\u8272\u7406\u8bba\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u800c\u66f4\u9ad8\u8272\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8868\u793a\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u56f0\u96be", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Disco\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u62d3\u6251\u6807\u8bb0\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u90bb\u63a5\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u91cd\u53e0\u7ec6\u80de\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5206\u5272\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Such constraints arise naturally in safety-critical applications and in rare-event simulation, where soft or reward-based guidance methods offer no guarantee of constraint satisfaction. Building on a probabilistic interpretation of diffusion models, we develop a principled conditional diffusion guidance framework based on Doob's h-transform, martingale representation and quadratic variation process. Specifically, the resulting guided dynamics augment a pretrained diffusion with an explicit drift correction involving the logarithmic gradient of a conditioning function, without modifying the pretrained score network. Leveraging martingale and quadratic-variation identities, we propose two novel off-policy learning algorithms based on a martingale loss and a martingale-covariation loss to estimate h and its gradient using only trajectories from the pretrained model.

Neural rendering-based approaches offer high-fidelity NVS and detailed geometry from posed images, yet they typically assume fixed camera poses and can be sensitive to pose errors. As a result, it remains non-trivial to obtain a single framework that can offer accurate poses, reliable depth, high-quality rendering, and accurate 3D surfaces from casually captured views. We present NeVStereo, a NeRF-driven NVS-stereo architecture that aims to jointly deliver camera poses, multi-view depth, novel view synthesis, and surface reconstruction from multi-view RGB-only inputs. NeVStereo combines NeRF-based NVS for stereo-friendly renderings, confidence-guided multi-view depth estimation, NeRF-coupled bundle adjustment for pose refinement, and an iterative refinement stage that updates both depth and the radiance field to improve geometric consistency. This design mitigated the common NeRF-based issues such as surface stacking, artifacts, and pose-depth coupling. Across indoor, outdoor, tabletop, and aerial benchmarks, our experiments indicate that NeVStereo achieves consistently strong zero-shot performance, with up to 36% lower depth error, 10.4% improved pose accuracy, 4.5% higher NVS fidelity, and state-of-the-art mesh quality (F1 91.93%, Chamfer 4.35 mm) compared to existing prestigious methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "NeVStereo\uff1aNeRF\u9a71\u52a8\u7684NVS-\u7acb\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u3001\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u548c\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bc6\u96c63D\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff1a\u524d\u9988\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0d\u8f93\u51fa\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u56fa\u5b9a\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u654f\u611f\u4e14\u53d7\u59ff\u6001\u8bef\u5dee\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u4ece\u65e5\u5e38\u62cd\u6444\u89c6\u89d2\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cbe\u786e\u59ff\u6001\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6df1\u5ea6\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u51c6\u786e3D\u8868\u9762\u3002", "method": "NeVStereo\u7ed3\u5408NeRF\u57fa\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u751f\u6210\u7acb\u4f53\u53cb\u597d\u6e32\u67d3\u3001\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5f15\u5bfc\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001NeRF\u8026\u5408\u5149\u675f\u6cd5\u5e73\u5dee\u8fdb\u884c\u59ff\u6001\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ec6\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\u540c\u65f6\u66f4\u65b0\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u8f90\u5c04\u573a\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u8868\u9762\u5806\u53e0\u3001\u4f2a\u5f71\u548c\u59ff\u6001-\u6df1\u5ea6\u8026\u5408\u7b49\u5e38\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5ba4\u5185\u3001\u5ba4\u5916\u3001\u684c\u9762\u548c\u822a\u7a7a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cNeVStereo\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u5f3a\u52b2\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6df1\u5ea6\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe36%\uff0c\u59ff\u6001\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u534710.4%\uff0c\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53474.5%\uff0c\u5e76\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7f51\u683c\u8d28\u91cf\uff08F1 91.93%\uff0cChamfer\u8ddd\u79bb4.35\u6beb\u7c73\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "NeVStereo\u901a\u8fc7NeRF\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u7acb\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\u6709\u6548\u8054\u5408\u4e86\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u3001\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u548c\u8868\u9762\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5bc6\u96c63D\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This study proposes a hybrid predictive framework that recommends real-time safe speed intervals for freeway travel under diverse weather conditions. Leveraging high-resolution Connected Vehicle (CV) data and Road Weather Information System (RWIS) data collected in Buffalo, NY, from 2022 to 2023, we construct a spatiotemporally aligned dataset containing over 6.6 million records across 73 days. The core model employs Quantile Regression Forests (QRF) to estimate vehicle speed distributions in 10-minute windows, using 26 input features that capture meteorological, pavement, and temporal conditions. To enforce safety constraints, a physics-based upper speed limit is computed for each interval based on real-time road grip and visibility, ensuring that vehicles can safely stop within their sight distance. The final recommended interval fuses QRF-predicted quantiles with both posted speed limits and the physics-derived upper bound. Experimental results demonstrate strong predictive performance: the QRF model achieves a mean absolute error of 1.55 mph, with 96.43% of median speed predictions within 5 mph, a PICP (50%) of 48.55%, and robust generalization across weather types. The model's ability to respond to changing weather conditions and generalize across road segments shows promise for real-world deployment, thereby improving traffic safety and reducing weather-related crashes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

When measuring such glossy surfaces, specular reflection and indirect illumination often lead to severe distortion or loss of the projected fringe patterns. To address these issues, we propose a latent diffusion-based structured light for reflective objects (LD-SLRO). Phase-shifted fringe images captured from highly reflective surfaces are first encoded to extract latent representations that capture surface reflectance characteristics. These latent features are then used as conditional inputs to a latent diffusion model, which probabilistically suppresses reflection-induced artifacts and recover lost fringe information, yielding high-quality fringe images. The proposed components, including the specular reflection encoder, time-variant channel affine layer, and attention modules, further improve fringe restoration quality. In addition, LD-SLRO provides high flexibility in configuring the input and output fringe sets.

By explicitly characterizing this variance, we identify 1) a high-variance regime near the prior, where optimization is challenging, and 2) a low-variance regime near the data distribution, where conditional and marginal velocities nearly coincide. Leveraging this insight, we propose Stable Velocity, a unified framework that improves both training and sampling. For training, we introduce Stable Velocity Matching (StableVM), an unbiased variance-reduction objective, along with Variance-Aware Representation Alignment (VA-REPA), which adaptively strengthen auxiliary supervision in the low-variance regime. For inference, we show that dynamics in the low-variance regime admit closed-form simplifications, enabling Stable Velocity Sampling (StableVS), a finetuning-free acceleration. Extensive experiments on ImageNet $256\\times256$ and large pretrained text-to-image and text-to-video models, including SD3.5, Flux, Qwen-Image, and Wan2.2, demonstrate consistent improvements in training efficiency and more than $2\\times$ faster sampling within the low-variance regime without degrading sample quality.

Cross-lingual knowledge transfer has emerged as a promising approach to address this challenge by leveraging resources from high-resource languages. In this paper, we investigate methods for transferring linguistic knowledge from high-resource languages to low-resource languages, where the number of labeled training instances is in hundreds. We focus on sentence-level and word-level tasks. We introduce a novel method, GETR (Graph-Enhanced Token Representation) for cross-lingual knowledge transfer along with two adopted baselines (a) augmentation in hidden layers and (b) token embedding transfer through token translation. Experimental results demonstrate that our GNN-based approach significantly outperforms existing multilingual and cross-lingual baseline methods, achieving 13 percentage point improvements on truly low-resource languages (Mizo, Khasi) for POS tagging, and 20 and 27 percentage point improvements in macro-F1 on simulated low-resource languages (Marathi, Bangla, Malayalam) across sentiment classification and NER tasks respectively. We also present a detailed analysis of the transfer mechanisms and identify key factors that contribute to successful knowledge transfer in this linguistic context.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Non-destructive testing (NDT) methods are preferred as they do not influence the functionality of the object while inspecting. Automated data evaluation for automated defect detection is a growing field of research. In particular, machine learning approaches show promising results. To provide training data in sufficient amount and quality, synthetic data can be used. Rule-based approaches enable synthetic data generation in a controllable environment. Therefore, a digital twin of the inspected object including synthetic defects is needed. We present parametric methods to model 3d mesh objects of various defect types that can then be added to the object geometry to obtain synthetic defective objects. The models are motivated by common defects in metal casting but can be transferred to other machining procedures that produce similar defect shapes. Synthetic data resembling the real inspection data can then be created by using a physically based Monte Carlo simulation of the respective testing method. Using our defect models, a variable and arbitrarily large synthetic data set can be generated with the possibility to include rarely occurring defects in sufficient quantity. Pixel-perfect annotation can be created in parallel. As an example, we will use visual surface inspection, but the procedure can be applied in combination with simulations for any other NDT method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5305\u542b\u5404\u79cd\u7f3a\u9677\u7c7b\u578b\u76843D\u7f51\u683c\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u521b\u5efa\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5408\u6210\u7f3a\u9677\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u8d28\u91cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u6570\u636e\u6765\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u771f\u5b9e\u7f3a\u9677\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7f55\u89c1\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u53c2\u6570\u53163D\u7f3a\u9677\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u5219\u521b\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u5408\u6210\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u5bf9\u8c61\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u751f\u6210\u903c\u771f\u7684\u975e\u7834\u574f\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u884c\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u786e\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u610f\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u53ef\u53d8\u6027\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8db3\u591f\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u7f55\u89c1\u7f3a\u9677\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7f3a\u9677\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5404\u79cd\u975e\u7834\u574f\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u91d1\u5c5e\u94f8\u9020\u7b49\u52a0\u5de5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002"}}

A Reliability Metric for XAI", "comment": null, "summary": "In recent years, explaining decisions made by complex machine learning models has become essential in high-stakes domains such as energy systems, healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems. However, the reliability of these explanations, namely, whether they remain stable and consistent under realistic, non-adversarial changes, remains largely unmeasured. Widely used methods such as SHAP and Integrated Gradients (IG) are well-motivated by axiomatic notions of attribution, yet their explanations can vary substantially even under system-level conditions, including small input perturbations, correlated representations, and minor model updates. Such variability undermines explanation reliability, as reliable explanations should remain consistent across equivalent input representations and small, performance-preserving model changes. We introduce the Explanation Reliability Index (ERI), a family of metrics that quantifies explanation stability under four reliability axioms: robustness to small input perturbations, consistency under feature redundancy, smoothness across model evolution, and resilience to mild distributional shifts. For each axiom, we derive formal guarantees, including Lipschitz-type bounds and temporal stability results. We further propose ERI-T, a dedicated measure of temporal reliability for sequential models, and introduce ERI-Bench, a benchmark designed to systematically stress-test explanation reliability across synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results reveal widespread reliability failures in popular explanation methods, showing that explanations can be unstable under realistic deployment conditions. By exposing and quantifying these instabilities, ERI enables principled assessment of explanation reliability and supports more trustworthy explainable AI (XAI) systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This challenge is particularly acute for autonomous agents in dynamic environments that require frequent, real-time belief updates. Existing methods are often inefficient for ongoing reasoning, as they re-evaluate the entire model upon any change, failing to exploit that real-world information streams have heterogeneous update rates. To address this, we approach the problem from a reactive, asynchronous, probabilistic reasoning perspective. We first introduce Resin (Reactive Signal Inference), a probabilistic programming language that merges probabilistic logic with reactive programming. Furthermore, to provide efficient and exact semantics for Resin, we propose Reactive Circuits (RCs). Formulated as a meta-structure over Algebraic Circuits and asynchronous data streams, RCs are time-dynamic Directed Acyclic Graphs that autonomously adapt themselves based on the volatility of input signals. In high-fidelity drone swarm simulations, our approach achieves several orders of magnitude of speedup over frequency-agnostic inference. We demonstrate that RCs' structural adaptations successfully capture environmental dynamics, significantly reducing latency and facilitating reactive real-time reasoning. By partitioning computations based on the estimated Frequency of Change in the asynchronous inputs, large inference tasks can be decomposed into individually memoized sub-problems. This ensures that only the specific components of a model affected by new information are re-evaluated, drastically reducing redundant computation in streaming contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Among the existing acceleration methods, Feature Caching is popular due to its training-free property and considerable speedup performance, but it inevitably faces semantic and detail drop with further compression. Another widely adopted method, training-aware step-distillation, though successful in image generation, also faces drastic degradation in video generation with a few steps. Furthermore, the quality loss becomes more severe when simply applying training-free feature caching to the step-distilled models, due to the sparser sampling steps. This paper novelly introduces a distillation-compatible learnable feature caching mechanism for the first time. We employ a lightweight learnable neural predictor instead of traditional training-free heuristics for diffusion models, enabling a more accurate capture of the high-dimensional feature evolution process. Furthermore, we explore the challenges of highly compressed distillation on large-scale video models and propose a conservative Restricted MeanFlow approach to achieve more stable and lossless distillation.

We introduce Generative Ontology, a framework that synthesizes these complementary strengths: ontology provides the grammar; the LLM provides the creativity.\n  Generative Ontology encodes domain knowledge as executable Pydantic schemas that constrain LLM generation via DSPy signatures. A multi-agent pipeline assigns specialized roles to different ontology domains: a Mechanics Architect designs game systems, a Theme Weaver integrates narrative, a Balance Critic identifies exploits. Each agent carrying a professional \"anxiety\" that prevents shallow, agreeable outputs. Retrieval-augmented generation grounds novel designs in precedents from existing exemplars, while iterative validation ensures coherence between mechanisms and components.\n  We demonstrate the framework through GameGrammar, a system for generating complete tabletop game designs. Given a thematic prompt (\"bioluminescent fungi competing in a cave ecosystem\"), the pipeline produces structurally complete, playable game specifications with mechanisms, components, victory conditions, and setup instructions. These outputs satisfy ontological constraints while remaining genuinely creative.\n  The pattern generalizes beyond games. Any domain with expert vocabulary, validity constraints, and accumulated exemplars (music composition, software architecture, culinary arts) is a candidate for Generative Ontology.

However, catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge. In this work, we identify attention drift in Vision Transformers as a primary source of catastrophic forgetting, where the attention to previously learned visual concepts shifts significantly after learning new tasks. Inspired by neuroscientific insights into the selective attention in the human visual system, we propose a novel attention-retaining framework to mitigate forgetting in CL. Our method constrains attention drift by explicitly modifying gradients during backpropagation through a two-step process: 1) extracting attention maps of the previous task using a layer-wise rollout mechanism and generating instance-adaptive binary masks, and 2) when learning a new task, applying these masks to zero out gradients associated with previous attention regions, thereby preventing disruption of learned visual concepts. For compatibility with modern optimizers, the gradient masking process is further enhanced by scaling parameter updates proportionally to maintain their relative magnitudes. Experiments and visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and preserving visual concepts. It achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits robust generalizability across diverse CL scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Screening features low prevalence of relevant studies and scarce, costly expert decisions. Traditional active learning (AL) systems help, yet typically rely on fixed query strategies for selecting the next unlabeled documents. These static strategies do not adapt over time and ignore the relational structure of scientific literature networks. This thesis introduces AutoDiscover, a framework that reframes AL as an online decision-making problem driven by an adaptive agent. Literature is modeled as a heterogeneous graph capturing relationships among documents, authors, and metadata. A Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HAN) learns node representations, which a Discounted Thompson Sampling (DTS) agent uses to dynamically manage a portfolio of query strategies. With real-time human-in-the-loop labels, the agent balances exploration and exploitation under non-stationary review dynamics, where strategy utility changes over time. On the 26-dataset SYNERGY benchmark, AutoDiscover achieves higher screening efficiency than static AL baselines. Crucially, the agent mitigates cold start by bootstrapping discovery from minimal initial labels where static approaches fail. We also introduce TS-Insight, an open-source visual analytics dashboard to interpret, verify, and diagnose the agent's decisions. Together, these contributions accelerate SLR screening under scarce expert labels and low prevalence of relevant studies.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Among diverse paradigms, graph stands out as a powerful structure for agent memory due to the intrinsic capabilities to model relational dependencies, organize hierarchical information, and support efficient retrieval. This survey presents a comprehensive review of agent memory from the graph-based perspective. First, we introduce a taxonomy of agent memory, including short-term vs. long-term memory, knowledge vs. experience memory, non-structural vs. structural memory, with an implementation view of graph-based memory. Second, according to the life cycle of agent memory, we systematically analyze the key techniques in graph-based agent memory, covering memory extraction for transforming the data into the contents, storage for organizing the data efficiently, retrieval for retrieving the relevant contents from memory to support reasoning, and evolution for updating the contents in the memory. Third, we summarize the open-sourced libraries and benchmarks that support the development and evaluation of self-evolving agent memory. We also explore diverse application scenarios.

However, existing methods are still unsatisfactory in terms of both success rate (SR) and generalization: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) approaches typically achieve higher SR, while Training-Free (TF) approaches often generalize better, but it is difficult to obtain both simultaneously. To this end, we propose a Memory-Execute-Review framework. It consists of three parts: a hierarchical memory module for providing information support, an execute module for routine decision-making and actions, and a review module for handling abnormal situations and correcting behavior. We validated the effectiveness of this framework on the Object Goal Navigation task. Across 4 datasets, our average SR achieved absolute improvements of 7% and 5% compared to all baseline methods under TF and Zero-Shot (ZS) settings, respectively. On the most commonly used HM3D_v0.1 and the more challenging open vocabulary dataset HM3D_OVON, the SR improved by 8% and 6%, under ZS settings. Furthermore, on the MP3D and HM3D_OVON datasets, our method not only outperformed all TF methods but also surpassed all SFT methods, achieving comprehensive leadership in both SR (5% and 2%) and generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing approaches typically estimate energy consumption through simple linear functions of input and output sequence lengths, yet our observations reveal clear Energy Efficiency regimes: peak efficiency occurs with short-to-moderate inputs and medium-length outputs, while efficiency drops sharply for long inputs or very short outputs, indicating a non-linear dependency. In this work, we propose an analytical model derived from the computational and memory-access complexity of the Transformer architecture, capable of accurately characterizing the efficiency curve as a function of input and output lengths. To assess its accuracy, we evaluate energy consumption using TensorRT-LLM on NVIDIA H100 GPUs across a diverse set of LLMs ranging from 1B to 9B parameters, including OPT, LLaMA, Gemma, Falcon, Qwen2, and Granite, tested over input and output lengths from 64 to 4096 tokens, achieving a mean MAPE of 1.79%.

However, existing benchmark datasets often suffer from limitations such as single spatial resolution, insufficient data scale, and low alignment accuracy, making them inadequate for supporting the training and generalization of multi-scale foundation models. To address these challenges, we introduce SOMA-1M (SAR-Optical Multi-resolution Alignment), a pixel-level precisely aligned dataset containing over 1.3 million pairs of georeferenced images with a specification of 512 x 512 pixels. This dataset integrates imagery from Sentinel-1, PIESAT-1, Capella Space, and Google Earth, achieving global multi-scale coverage from 0.5 m to 10 m. It encompasses 12 typical land cover categories, effectively ensuring scene diversity and complexity. To address multimodal projection deformation and massive data registration, we designed a rigorous coarse-to-fine image matching framework ensuring pixel-level alignment. Based on this dataset, we established comprehensive evaluation benchmarks for four hierarchical vision tasks, including image matching, image fusion, SAR-assisted cloud removal, and cross-modal translation, involving over 30 mainstream algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that supervised training on SOMA-1M significantly enhances performance across all tasks. Notably, multimodal remote sensing image (MRSI) matching performance achieves current state-of-the-art (SOTA) levels. SOMA-1M serves as a foundational resource for robust multimodal algorithms and remote sensing foundation models.

However, rubric generation remains hard to control: rubrics often lack coverage, conflate dimensions, misalign preference direction, and contain redundant or highly correlated criteria, degrading judge accuracy and producing suboptimal rewards during RFT. We propose RRD, a principled framework for rubric refinement built on a recursive decompose-filter cycle. RRD decomposes coarse rubrics into fine-grained, discriminative criteria, expanding coverage while sharpening separation between responses. A complementary filtering mechanism removes misaligned and redundant rubrics, and a correlation-aware weighting scheme prevents over-representing highly correlated criteria, yielding rubric sets that are informative, comprehensive, and non-redundant. Empirically, RRD delivers large, consistent gains across both evaluation and training: it improves preference-judgment accuracy on JudgeBench and PPE for both GPT-4o and Llama3.1-405B judges, achieving top performance in all settings with up to +17.7 points on JudgeBench. When used as the reward source for RFT on WildChat, it yields substantially stronger and more stable learning signals, boosting reward by up to 160% (Qwen3-4B) and 60% (Llama3.1-8B) versus 10-20% for prior rubric baselines, with gains that transfer to HealthBench-Hard and BiGGen Bench.

In this paper, we find that these basis vectors exhibit significant parameter redundancy and can be compactly represented by lightweight nonlinear functions. Therefore, we propose Generative Low-Rank Adapter (GenLoRA), which replaces explicit basis vector storage with nonlinear basis vector generation. Specifically, GenLoRA maintains a latent vector for each low-rank matrix and employs a set of lightweight radial basis functions (RBFs) to synthesize the basis vectors. Each RBF requires far fewer parameters than an explicit basis vector, enabling higher parameter efficiency in GenLoRA.

The aim was to find the best features detector and descriptor for fisheye images, in the context of selfcalibration, with cameras mounted on the top of a car and aiming at the zenith (to proceed then fisheye visual odometry and stereovision in urban scenes). We face a chicken and egg problem, because we can not take advantage of an accurate projection model for an optimal features detection and description, and we rightly need good features to perform the calibration (i.e. to compute the accurate projection model of the camera). What is not this report: It does not contribute with new features algorithm. It does not compare standard features algorithms to algorithms designed for omnidirectional images (unfortunately).

Designing these pipelines requires substantial domain expertise and engineering effort, motivating the question of how large language models (LLMs) can support tabular ML through code synthesis. We introduce SemPipes, a novel declarative programming model that integrates LLM-powered semantic data operators into tabular ML pipelines. Semantic operators specify data transformations in natural language while delegating execution to a runtime system. During training, SemPipes synthesizes custom operator implementations based on data characteristics, operator instructions, and pipeline context. This design enables the automatic optimization of data operations in a pipeline via LLM-based code synthesis guided by evolutionary search. We evaluate SemPipes across diverse tabular ML tasks and show that semantic operators substantially improve end-to-end predictive performance for both expert-designed and agent-generated pipelines, while reducing pipeline complexity.

We propose Anchored Policy Optimization (APO), shifting the paradigm from global Shape Matching to Support Coverage. By defining a Safe Manifold based on the reference model's high-confidence support, APO permits aggressive sharpening for efficiency while selectively invoking a restorative force during error correction to prevent collapse. We theoretically derive that APO serves as a gradient-aligned mechanism to maximize support coverage, enabling an Elastic Recovery that re-inflates valid branches.

Specifically, we first propose a motion-aware submap construction mechanism that uses optical flow to guide adaptive partitioning, prune static redundancy, and encapsulate turns for stable local geometry. We then design an anchor-driven direct Sim(3) registration strategy. By exploiting context-balanced anchors, it achieves search-free, pixel-wise dense alignment and efficient loop closure without costly feature matching. Finally, a lightweight submap-level pose graph optimization enforces global consistency with linear complexity, enabling scalable long-range operation.

This push--pull interaction induces radial oscillations, injecting noise into Adam's second-moment estimates and potentially degrading delicate tangential feature learning. We argue that magnitude and direction play distinct roles and should be decoupled in optimizer dynamics. We propose Orthogonal Dynamics Decoupling and instantiate it as AdamO: an SGD-style update handles the one-dimensional norm control, while Adam's adaptive preconditioning is confined to the tangential subspace. AdamO further incorporates curvature-adaptive radial step sizing and architecture-aware rules and projections for scale-invariant layers and low-dimensional parameters.

While retrieved documents help address knowledge gaps, model-generated responses still suffer from hallucinations that contradict the retrieved information. To mitigate this inconsistency, we propose a Reinforcement Learning framework enhanced with Fine-grained Knowledge Verification (RLFKV). Our method decomposes financial responses into atomic knowledge units and assesses the correctness of each unit to compute the fine-grained faithful reward.

Existing MIAs primarily rely on static indicators, such as loss or confidence, and do not fully leverage the dynamic behavior of models when actively probed. We propose LeakBoost, a perceptual-loss-based interrogation framework that actively probes a model's internal representations to expose hidden membership signals. Given a candidate input, LeakBoost synthesizes an interrogation image by optimizing a perceptual (activation-space) objective, amplifying representational differences between members and non-members. This image is then analyzed by an off-the-shelf membership detector, without modifying the detector itself. When combined with existing membership inference methods, LeakBoost achieves substantial improvements at low false-positive rates across multiple image classification datasets and diverse neural network architectures. In particular, it raises AUC from near-chance levels (0.53-0.62) to 0.81-0.88, and increases TPR at 1 percent FPR by over an order of magnitude compared to strong baseline attacks. A detailed sensitivity analysis reveals that deeper layers and short, low-learning-rate optimization produce the strongest leakage, and that improvements concentrate in gradient-based detectors. LeakBoost thus offers a modular and computationally efficient way to assess privacy risks in white-box settings, advancing the study of dynamic membership inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A particularly common form of shift occurs when the prevalence of positive outcomes changes differently across demographic groups--for example, when disease rates rise faster in one population than another, or when economic conditions affect loan default rates unequally. We study group-conditional prior probability shift (GPPS), where the label prevalence $P(Y=1\\mid A=a)$ may change between training and deployment while the feature-generation process $P(X\\mid Y,A)$ remains stable. Our analysis yields three main contributions. First, we prove a fundamental dichotomy: fairness criteria based on error rates (equalized odds) are structurally invariant under GPPS, while acceptance-rate criteria (demographic parity) can drift--and we prove this drift is unavoidable for non-trivial classifiers (shift-robust impossibility). Second, we show that target-domain risk and fairness metrics are identifiable without target labels: the invariance of ROC quantities under GPPS enables consistent estimation from source labels and unlabeled target data alone, with finite-sample guarantees. Third, we propose TAP-GPPS, a label-free post-processing algorithm that estimates prevalences from unlabeled data, corrects posteriors, and selects thresholds to satisfy demographic parity in the target domain.

We revisit this limitation from an information-theoretic perspective and deduce that ensuring each scale contributes high-frequency content not explained by earlier scales mitigates the train-inference discrepancy. With this insight, we propose Scaled Spatial Guidance (SSG), training-free, inference-time guidance that steers generation toward the intended hierarchy while maintaining global coherence. SSG emphasizes target high-frequency signals, defined as the semantic residual, isolated from a coarser prior. To obtain this prior, we leverage a principled frequency-domain procedure, Discrete Spatial Enhancement (DSE), which is devised to sharpen and better isolate the semantic residual through frequency-aware construction. SSG applies broadly across VAR models leveraging discrete visual tokens, regardless of tokenization design or conditioning modality.

To overcome this challenge, this paper, for the first time, proposes and implements a fully-asynchronous policy training framework encompassing the entire pipeline from environment interaction, rollout generation, to actor policy updates. Systematically drawing inspiration from asynchronous optimization ideas in large model RL, our framework designs a multi-level decoupled architecture. This includes asynchronous parallelization of environment interaction and trajectory collection, streaming execution for policy generation, and decoupled scheduling for training updates. We validated the effectiveness of our method across diverse VLA models and environments. On the LIBERO benchmark, the framework achieves throughput improvements of up to 59.25\\% compared to existing synchronous strategies. When deeply optimizing separation strategies, throughput can be increased by as much as 126.67\\%. We verified the effectiveness of each asynchronous component via ablation studies.

Although many existing fault classification studies rely solely on direct fault labels, the aforementioned signals naturally embed additional information shaped by other physically coupled information. Herein, we leverage this coupling through a multi-task learning (MTL) framework that jointly learns fault conditions and the related physical variables. Among MTL architectures, crosstalk structures have distinct advantages because they allow for controlled information exchange between tasks through the cross-talk layer while preventing negative transfer, in contrast to shared trunk architectures that often mix incompatible features. We build on our previously introduced residual neural dimension reductor model, and extend its application to two benchmarks where physical coupling is prominent. The first benchmark is a drone fault dataset, in which machine type and maneuvering direction significantly alter the frequency components of measured signals even under the same nominal condition. By learning fault classification together with these physical attributes, the cross-talk architecture can better classify faults. The second benchmark dataset is the motor compound fault dataset.

Recent methods predominantly use the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. To achieve satisfactory runtime, several methods attempt to accelerate the computations in the DiT, but fail to address structural sources of inefficiency. In this work, we identify and remove two types of computational redundancy in earlier work: motion redundancy arises because the generic DiT architecture does not reflect the fact that frame-to-frame motion is small and smooth; gradient redundancy occurs if one ignores that gradients change slowly along the diffusion trajectory. To mitigate motion redundancy, we mask the corresponding attention layers to a local neighborhood such that interaction weights are not computed unnecessarily distant image regions. To exploit gradient redundancy, we design an optimization scheme that reuses gradients from previous diffusion steps and skips unwarranted gradient computations. On average, FastVMT achieves a 3.43x speedup without degrading the visual fidelity or the temporal consistency of the generated videos.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Most existing approaches, such as LoRA and PiSSA, rely on low-rank decompositions of weight updates. However, the low-rank assumption may restrict expressivity, particularly in task-specific adaptation scenarios where singular values are distributed relatively uniformly. To address this limitation, we propose CoSA (Compressed Sensing-Based Adaptation), a new PEFT method extended from compressed sensing theory. Instead of constraining weight updates to a low-rank subspace, CoSA expresses them through fixed random projection matrices and a compact learnable core. We provide a formal theoretical analysis of CoSA as a synthesis process, proving that weight updates can be compactly encoded into a low-dimensional space and mapped back through random projections. Extensive experimental results show that CoSA provides a principled perspective for efficient and expressive multi-scale model adaptation. Specifically, we evaluate CoSA on 10 diverse tasks, including natural language understanding and generation, employing 5 models of different scales from RoBERTa, Llama, and Qwen families.

The dataset provides a realistic and application-relevant testbed for benchmarking these methods in the context of industrial robotics bridging the gap between lab-based research and deployment in real-world manufacturing scenarios. Unlike many previous datasets that focus on household or consumer products or use synthetic, clean tabletop datasets, or objects captured solely in controlled lab environments, IndustryShapes introduces five new object types with challenging properties, also captured in realistic industrial assembly settings. The dataset has diverse complexity, from simple to more challenging scenes, with single and multiple objects, including scenes with multiple instances of the same object and it is organized in two parts: the classic set and the extended set. The classic set includes a total of 4,6k images and 6k annotated poses. The extended set introduces additional data modalities to support the evaluation of model-free and sequence-based approaches. To the best of our knowledge, IndustryShapes is the first dataset to offer RGB-D static onboarding sequences. We further evaluate the dataset on a representative set of state-of-the art methods for instance-based and novel object 6D pose estimation, including also object detection, segmentation, showing that there is room for improvement in this domain.

This position paper argues that capability control -- imposing restrictions on permissible model behavior -- should be treated as a distinct goal from alignment. While alignment is often context and preference-driven, capability control aims to impose hard operational limits on permissible behaviors, including under adversarial elicitation. We organize capability control mechanisms across the model lifecycle into three layers: (i) data-based control of the training distribution, (ii) learning-based control via weight- or representation-level interventions, and (iii) system-based control via post-deployment guardrails over inputs, outputs, and actions. Because each layer has characteristic failure modes when used in isolation, we advocate for a defense-in-depth approach that composes complementary controls across the full stack.

Extending PI3DETR, our method streamlines parametric 3D object detection by jointly estimating multi-class 6-DoF poses and class-specific parametric attributes directly from occlusion-affected point cloud data. This formulation enables not only geometric localization but also the estimation of task-relevant properties for parametric objects, such as a gripper's opening, where the 3D model is adjusted according to simple, predefined rules. The architecture employs modular, class-specific heads, making it straightforward to extend to novel object types without re-designing the pipeline. We validate PIRATR on an automated forklift platform, focusing on three structurally and functionally diverse categories: crane grippers, loading platforms, and pallets. Trained entirely in a synthetic environment, PIRATR generalizes effectively to real outdoor LiDAR scans, achieving a detection mAP of 0.919 without additional fine-tuning. PIRATR establishes a new paradigm of pose-aware, parameterized perception. This bridges the gap between low-level geometric reasoning and actionable world models, paving the way for scalable, simulation-trained perception systems that can be deployed in dynamic robotic environments.

However, dominant approaches like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) face critical stability challenges: they suffer from high estimator variance under computational constraints (small group sizes) and vanishing gradient signals in saturated failure regimes where all responses yield identical zero rewards. To address this, we propose Empirical Bayes Policy Optimization (EBPO), a novel framework that regularizes local group-based baselines by borrowing strength from the policy's accumulated global statistics. Instead of estimating baselines in isolation, EBPO employs a shrinkage estimator that dynamically balances local group statistics with a global prior updated via Welford's online algorithm. Theoretically, we demonstrate that EBPO guarantees strictly lower Mean Squared Error (MSE), bounded entropy decay, and non-vanishing penalty signals in failure scenarios compared to GRPO. Empirically, EBPO consistently outperforms GRPO and other established baselines across diverse benchmarks, including AIME and OlympiadBench. Notably, EBPO exhibits superior training stability, achieving high-performance gains even with small group sizes, and benefits significantly from difficulty-stratified curriculum learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate significant potential in TKGQA, current prompting strategies constrain their efficacy in two primary ways. First, they are prone to reasoning hallucinations under complex temporal constraints. Second, static prompting limits model autonomy and generalization, as it lack optimization through dynamic interaction with temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) environments. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{TKG-Thinker}, a novel agent equipped with autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval capabilities for reasoning over TKGs. Specifically, TKG-Thinker performs in-depth temporal reasoning through dynamic multi-turn interactions with TKGs via a dual-training strategy. We first apply Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with chain-of thought data to instill core planning capabilities, followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage that leverages multi-dimensional rewards to refine reasoning policies under intricate temporal constraints.

Seasonal models offer coarse forecasts that miss the fine-scale variability needed for daily, responsive ecosystem management. We present study that compares four deep learning architectures for daily hypoxia classification: Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Medformer (Medical Transformer), Spatio-Temporal Transformer (ST-Transformer), and Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN). We trained our models with twelve years of daily hindcast data from 2009-2020 Our training data consists of 2009-2020 hindcast data from a coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical model. Similarly, we use hindcast data from 2020 through 2024 as a test data. We constructed classification models incorporating water column stratification, sediment oxygen consumption, and temperature-dependent decomposition rates. We evaluated each architectures using the same data preprocessing, input/output formulation, and validation protocols. Each model achieved high classification accuracy and strong discriminative ability with ST-Transformer achieving the highest performance across all metrics and tests periods (AUC-ROC: 0.982-0.992). We also employed McNemar's method to identify statistically significant differences in model predictions. Our contribution is a reproducible framework for operational real-time hypoxia prediction that can support broader efforts in the environmental and ocean modeling systems community and in ecosystem resilience.

ViGT represents a step towards foundational geometric models for autonomous driving, prioritizing scalability, architectural simplicity, and generalization across diverse sensor configurations. Our approach achieves this through a calibration-free architecture, enabling a single model to adapt to different sensor setups. Unlike general-purpose geometric foundational models that focus on pixel-aligned predictions, ViGT estimates a continuous 3D occupancy field in a birds-eye-view (BEV) addressing domain-specific requirements. ViGT naturally infers geometry from multiple camera views into a single metric coordinate frame, providing a common representation for multiple geometric tasks. Unlike most existing occupancy models, we adopt a self-supervised training procedure that leverages synchronized image-LiDAR pairs, eliminating the need for costly manual annotations. We validate the scalability and generalizability of our approach by training our model on a mixture of five large-scale autonomous driving datasets (NuScenes, Waymo, NuPlan, ONCE, and Argoverse) and achieving state-of-the-art performance on the pointmap estimation task, with the best average rank across all evaluated baselines.

Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have recently shown to be useful for data-centric interpretability. In this work, we analyze large-scale reinforcement learning training runs from the sophisticated environment of Full-Press Diplomacy by applying pretrained SAEs, alongside LLM-summarizer methods. We introduce Meta-Autointerp, a method for grouping SAE features into interpretable hypotheses about training dynamics. We discover fine-grained behaviors including role-playing patterns, degenerate outputs, language switching, alongside high-level strategic behaviors and environment-specific bugs. Through automated evaluation, we validate that 90% of discovered SAE Meta-Features are significant, and find a surprising reward hacking behavior. However, through two user studies, we find that even subjectively interesting and seemingly helpful SAE features may be worse than useless to humans, along with most LLM generated hypotheses. However, a subset of SAE-derived hypotheses are predictively useful for downstream tasks. We further provide validation by augmenting an untrained agent's system prompt, improving the score by +14.2%. Overall, we show that SAEs and LLM-summarizer provide complementary views into agent behavior, and together our framework forms a practical starting point for future data-centric interpretability work on ensuring trustworthy LLM behavior throughout training.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing spectral operators rely on static Fourier kernels applied uniformly across inputs, limiting their ability to capture multi-scale, regime-dependent, and anisotropic dynamics governed by the global state of the system. We introduce SpectraKAN, a neural operator that conditions the spectral operator on the input itself, turning static spectral convolution into an input-conditioned integral operator. This is achieved by extracting a compact global representation from spatio-temporal history and using it to modulate a multi-scale Fourier trunk via single-query cross-attention, enabling the operator to adapt its behaviour while retaining the efficiency of spectral mixing. We provide theoretical justification showing that this modulation converges to a resolution-independent continuous operator under mesh refinement and KAN gives smooth, Lipschitz-controlled global modulation. Across diverse PDE benchmarks, SpectraKAN achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing RMSE by up to 49% over strong baselines, with particularly large gains on challenging spatio-temporal prediction tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SpectraKAN\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u8c31\u7b97\u5b50\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165\u672c\u8eab\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u53d6\u4ee3\u9759\u6001\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u6838\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5168\u5c40\u8868\u793a\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8c03\u5236\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c31\u5377\u79ef\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8c31\u7b97\u5b50\uff08\u5982FNO\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u9759\u6001\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u5747\u5300\u6838\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u72b6\u6001\u76f8\u5173\u548c\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742PDE\u89e3\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "1. \u4ece\u65f6\u7a7a\u5386\u53f2\u63d0\u53d6\u7d27\u51d1\u5168\u5c40\u8868\u793a\uff1b2. \u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u67e5\u8be2\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8c03\u5236\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u4e3b\u5e72\uff1b3. \u5b9e\u73b0\u8f93\u5165\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684\u79ef\u5206\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u8c31\u6df7\u5408\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837PDE\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\uff0cRMSE\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe49%\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "SpectraKAN\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8c31\u7b97\u5b50\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9759\u6001\u8c31\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u5728PDE\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002"}}

Fixed-budget top-k sparse attention cannot adapt to heterogeneous attention distributions across heads and layers, whereas top-p sparse attention directly preserves attention mass and provides stronger accuracy guarantees. Existing top-p methods, however, fail to jointly optimize top-p accuracy, selection overhead, and sparse attention cost, which limits their overall efficiency. We present Double-P, a hierarchical sparse attention framework that optimizes all three stages. Double-P first performs coarse-grained top-p estimation at the cluster level using size-weighted centroids, then adaptively refines computation through a second top-p stage that allocates token-level attention only when needed. Across long-context benchmarks, Double-P consistently achieves near-zero accuracy drop, reducing attention computation overhead by up to 1.8x and delivers up to 1.3x end-to-end decoding speedup over state-of-the-art fixed-budget sparse attention methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Double-P\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5c42\u6b21\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5top-p\u4f30\u8ba1\u4f18\u5316\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u968f\u7740key-value\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u589e\u957f\u800c\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u89e3\u7801\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684top-k\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u5934\u548c\u5c42\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u800ctop-p\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u76f4\u63a5\u4fdd\u7559\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709top-p\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316top-p\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u9009\u62e9\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6210\u672c\u3002", "method": "Double-P\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5c42\u6b21\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u5728\u805a\u7c7b\u7ea7\u522b\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u5c0f\u52a0\u6743\u8d28\u5fc3\u8fdb\u884c\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6top-p\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u901a\u8fc7\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2atop-p\u9636\u6bb5\u8fdb\u884c\u7ec6\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u9700\u8981\u65f6\u5206\u914dtoken\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDouble-P\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd1\u4e4e\u96f6\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u51cf\u5c11\u4e861.8\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u9884\u7b97\u7a00\u758f\u6ce8\u610f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e26\u67651.3\u500d\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u89e3\u7801\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "Double-P\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Although high-resolution radar observations have spurred extensive research on nowcasting models, precipitation nowcasting remains particularly challenging due to pronounced spatial locality, intricate fine-scale rainfall structures, and variability in forecasting horizons. While recent diffusion-based generative ensembles show promising results, they are computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time applications. In contrast, deterministic models are computationally efficient but remain biased toward normal rainfall. Furthermore, the benchmark datasets commonly used in prior studies are themselves skewed--either dominated by ordinary rainfall events or restricted to extreme rainfall episodes--thereby hindering general applicability in real-world settings. In this paper, we propose exPreCast, an efficient deterministic framework for generating finely detailed radar forecasts, and introduce a newly constructed balanced radar dataset from the Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA), which encompasses both ordinary precipitation and extreme events. Our model integrates local spatiotemporal attention, a texture-preserving cubic dual upsampling decoder, and a temporal extractor to flexibly adjust forecasting horizons. Experiments on established benchmarks (SEVIR and MeteoNet) as well as on the balanced KMA dataset demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering accurate and reliable nowcasts across both normal and extreme rainfall regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Classical sensitivity tools - conditioning analyses, Euclidean perturbation arguments, and Fisher information bounds - do not explain how individual image features influence the pose estimate, nor why dynamic or inconsistent observations can disproportionately distort modern SLAM and structure-from-motion systems. To address this gap, we extend influence function theory to matrix Lie groups and derive an intrinsic perturbation operator for left-trivialized M-estimators on SE(3).\n  The resulting Geometric Observability Index (GOI) quantifies the contribution of a single measurement through the curvature operator and the Lie algebraic structure of the observable subspace. GOI admits a spectral decomposition along the principal directions of the observable curvature, revealing a direct correspondence between weak observability and amplified sensitivity. In the population regime, GOI coincides with the Fisher information geometry on SE(3), yielding a single-measurement analogue of the Cramer-Rao bound.\n  The same spectral mechanism explains classical degeneracies such as pure rotation and vanishing parallax, as well as dynamic feature amplification along weak curvature directions. Overall, GOI provides a geometrically consistent description of measurement influence that unifies conditioning analysis, Fisher information geometry, influence function theory, and dynamic scene detectability through the spectral geometry of the curvature operator. Because these quantities arise directly within Gauss-Newton pipelines, the curvature spectrum and GOI also yield lightweight, training-free diagnostic signals for identifying dynamic features and detecting weak observability configurations without modifying existing SLAM architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5355\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u7684\u7b97\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6GOI\uff0c\u5c06Fisher\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u66f2\u7387\u8c31\u7edf\u4e00\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u4e3aSLAM\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bca\u65ad\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7075\u654f\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff08\u6761\u4ef6\u6570\u5206\u6790\u3001\u6b27\u6c0f\u6270\u52a8\u8bba\u8bc1\u3001Fisher\u4fe1\u606f\u754c\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u5355\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4f4d\u59ff\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e0d\u80fd\u8bf4\u660e\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48\u52a8\u6001\u6216\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u4f1a\u4e0d\u6210\u6bd4\u4f8b\u5730\u626d\u66f2\u73b0\u4ee3SLAM\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u6062\u590d\u7ed3\u6784\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\u7406\u8bba\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u77e9\u9635\u674e\u7fa4\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51faSE(3)\u4e0a\u5de6\u5e73\u51e1\u5316M\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u7684\u5185\u5728\u6270\u52a8\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u51e0\u4f55\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u6307\u6570GOI\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u66f2\u7387\u7b97\u5b50\u548c\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u674e\u4ee3\u6570\u7ed3\u6784\u91cf\u5316\u5355\u6b21\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "result": "GOI\u5728\u8c31\u5206\u89e3\u4e2d\u6cbf\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u66f2\u7387\u4e3b\u65b9\u5411\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f31\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u6027\u4e0e\u653e\u5927\u654f\u611f\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u5728\u603b\u4f53\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\uff0cGOI\u4e0eSE(3)\u4e0a\u7684Fisher\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u5355\u6b21\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684Cramer-Rao\u754c\u7c7b\u4f3c\u7269\u3002", "conclusion": "GOI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u5f71\u54cd\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u6761\u4ef6\u6570\u5206\u6790\u3001Fisher\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u3001\u5f71\u54cd\u51fd\u6570\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\uff0c\u5176\u66f2\u7387\u8c31\u548cGOI\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5f31\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u914d\u7f6e\u3002"}}

Recent advances in generative modeling have introduced new paradigms for learning such representations. However, existing diffusion-based methods encourage factor independence via inductive biases, yet frequently lack strong semantic alignment. In this work, we propose a flow matching-based framework for disentangled representation learning, which casts disentanglement as learning factor-conditioned flows in a compact latent space. To enforce explicit semantic alignment, we introduce a non-overlap (orthogonality) regularizer that suppresses cross-factor interference and reduces information leakage between factors. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over representative baselines, yielding higher disentanglement scores as well as improved controllability and sample fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Concepts such as prompting, temperature, or few-shot examples are now widely recognized, and LLMs are increasingly used in Modeling & Simulation (M&S) workflows. However, practices that appear straightforward may introduce subtle issues, unnecessary complexity, or may even lead to inferior results. Adding more data can backfire (e.g., deteriorating performance through model collapse or inadvertently wiping out existing guardrails), spending time on fine-tuning a model can be unnecessary without a prior assessment of what it already knows, setting the temperature to 0 is not sufficient to make LLMs deterministic, providing a large volume of M&S data as input can be excessive (LLMs cannot attend to everything) but naive simplifications can lose information. We aim to provide comprehensive and practical guidance on how to use LLMs, with an emphasis on M&S applications. We discuss common sources of confusion, including non-determinism, knowledge augmentation (including RAG and LoRA), decomposition of M&S data, and hyper-parameter settings. We emphasize principled design choices, diagnostic strategies, and empirical evaluation, with the goal of helping modelers make informed decisions about when, how, and whether to rely on LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6279\u5224\u6027\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u4eff\u771f\uff08M&S\uff09\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u8bef\u533a\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u8868\u9762\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5b9e\u8df5\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u9690\u6027\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u91c7\u53d6\u539f\u5219\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740LLMs\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u4eff\u771f\uff08M&S\uff09\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u8bb8\u591a\u770b\u4f3c\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\uff08\u5982\u589e\u52a0\u6570\u636e\u3001\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u8bbe\u7f6e\u6e29\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u7b49\uff09\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u9690\u853d\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u4e0d\u5fc5\u8981\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u751a\u81f3\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u679c\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4e3aM&S\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u5168\u9762\u5b9e\u7528\u7684LLMs\u4f7f\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u907f\u514d\u5e38\u89c1\u9677\u9631\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u6279\u5224\u6027\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8ba8\u8bbaLLMs\u5728M&S\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\uff08\u5305\u62ecRAG\u548cLoRA\uff09\u3001M&S\u6570\u636e\u5206\u89e3\u4ee5\u53ca\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002\u5f3a\u8c03\u539f\u5219\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u6307\u51fa\u73b0\u6709\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u8bef\u533a\uff1a\u589e\u52a0\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\uff1b\u672a\u7ecf\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6548\uff1b\u6e29\u5ea6\u8bbe\u4e3a0\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u5927\u91cfM&S\u6570\u636e\u8f93\u5165\u53ef\u80fd\u8fc7\u8f7d\u4f46\u7b80\u5316\u53c8\u53ef\u80fd\u4e22\u5931\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728M&S\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528LLMs\u9700\u8981\u8c28\u614e\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e94\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c31\u4f55\u65f6\u3001\u5982\u4f55\u4ee5\u53ca\u662f\u5426\u4f9d\u8d56LLMs\u505a\u51fa\u77e5\u60c5\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u56e0\u8868\u9762\u7b80\u5355\u64cd\u4f5c\u800c\u9677\u5165\u6027\u80fd\u9677\u9631\u3002"}}

To alleviate clinicians' instructional burden and enhance trainees' learning efficiency, we introduce a mixed reality (MR) system for childbirth training that combines virtual guidance with tactile manikin interaction, thereby preserving authentic haptic feedback while enabling independent practice without continuous on-site expert supervision. The system extends the passthrough capability of commercial head-mounted displays (HMDs) by spatially calibrating an external RGB-D camera, allowing real-time visual integration of physical training objects. Building on this capability, we implement a coarse-to-fine localization pipeline that first aligns the maternal manikin with fiducial markers to define a delivery region and then registers the pre-scanned neonatal head within this area. This process enables spatially accurate overlay of virtual guiding hands near the manikin, allowing trainees to follow expert trajectories reinforced by haptic interaction. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the system achieves accurate and stable manikin localization on a standalone headset, ensuring practical deployment without external computing resources. A large-scale user study involving 83 fourth-year medical students was subsequently conducted to compare MR-based and virtual reality (VR)-based childbirth training. Four senior obstetricians independently assessed performance using standardized criteria. Results showed that MR training achieved significantly higher scores in delivery, post-delivery, and overall task performance, and was consistently preferred by trainees over VR training.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recent head-mounted camera-based approaches show promise in egocentric pose estimation, but encounter challenges when applied to VR head-mounted displays (HMDs), including temporal instability, inaccurate lower-body estimation, and the lack of real-time performance. To address these limitations, we present EgoPoseVR, an end-to-end framework for accurate egocentric full-body pose estimation in VR that integrates headset motion cues with egocentric RGB-D observations through a dual-modality fusion pipeline. A spatiotemporal encoder extracts frame- and joint-level representations, which are fused via cross-attention to fully exploit complementary motion cues across modalities. A kinematic optimization module then imposes constraints from HMD signals, enhancing the accuracy and stability of pose estimation. To facilitate training and evaluation, we introduce a large-scale synthetic dataset of over 1.8 million temporally aligned HMD and RGB-D frames across diverse VR scenarios.

However, by adapting strong optimization objectives from fine-tuning, current methods are susceptible to overfitting and often underperform, sometimes generating unnatural outputs. We hypothesize that this is because effective steering requires the faithful identification of internal model mechanisms, not the enforcement of external preferences. To this end, we build on the principles of distributed alignment search (DAS), the standard for causal variable localization, to propose a new steering method: Concept DAS (CDAS). While we adopt the core mechanism of DAS, distributed interchange intervention (DII), we introduce a novel distribution matching objective tailored for the steering task by aligning intervened output distributions with counterfactual distributions. CDAS differs from prior work in two main ways: first, it learns interventions via weak-supervised distribution matching rather than probability maximization; second, it uses DIIs that naturally enable bi-directional steering and allow steering factors to be derived from data, reducing the effort required for hyperparameter tuning and resulting in more faithful and stable control. On AxBench, a large-scale model steering benchmark, we show that CDAS does not always outperform preference-optimization methods but may benefit more from increased model scale. In two safety-related case studies, overriding refusal behaviors of safety-aligned models and neutralizing a chain-of-thought backdoor, CDAS achieves systematic steering while maintaining general model utility. These results indicate that CDAS is complementary to preference-optimization approaches and conditionally constitutes a robust approach to intervention-based model steering.

XSIM extends 3DGUT splatting with a generalized rolling-shutter modeling tailored for autonomous driving applications. Our framework provides a unified and flexible formulation for appearance and geometric sensor modeling, enabling rendering of complex sensor distortions in dynamic environments. We identify spherical cameras, such as LiDARs, as a critical edge case for existing 3DGUT splatting due to cyclic projection and time discontinuities at azimuth boundaries leading to incorrect particle projection. To address this issue, we propose a phase modeling mechanism that explicitly accounts temporal and shape discontinuities of Gaussians projected by the Unscented Transform at azimuth borders. In addition, we introduce an extended 3D Gaussian representation that incorporates two distinct opacity parameters to resolve mismatches between geometry and color distributions. As a result, our framework provides enhanced scene representations with improved geometric consistency and photorealistic appearance.

Structured pruning can reduce inference cost, but most methods rely on retraining or multi-stage optimization. These requirements limit post-training deployment. We propose \\textbf{CORP}, a closed-form one-shot structured pruning framework for Vision Transformers. CORP removes entire MLP hidden dimensions and attention substructures without labels, gradients, or fine-tuning. It operates under strict post-training constraints using only a small unlabeled calibration set. CORP formulates structured pruning as a representation recovery problem. It models removed activations and attention logits as affine functions of retained components and derives closed-form ridge regression solutions that fold compensation into model weights. This minimizes expected representation error under the calibration distribution. Experiments on ImageNet with DeiT models show strong redundancy in MLP and attention representations. Without compensation, one-shot structured pruning causes severe accuracy degradation. With CORP, models preserve accuracy under aggressive sparsity. On DeiT-Huge, CORP retains 82.8\\% Top-1 accuracy after pruning 50\\% of both MLP and attention structures. CORP completes pruning in under 20 minutes on a single GPU and delivers substantial real-world efficiency gains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCORP\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9762\u5411ViT\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u5355\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u7b7e\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u79fb\u9664\u6574\u4e2aMLP\u9690\u85cf\u7ef4\u5ea6\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u90e8\u7f72\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u5728\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5e26\u6765\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u8868\u793a\u6062\u590d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u4fdd\u7559\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u4eff\u5c04\u51fd\u6570\u5efa\u6a21\u79fb\u9664\u7684\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5bf9\u6570\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u95ed\u5f0f\u5cad\u56de\u5f52\u89e3\u5e76\u5c06\u8865\u507f\u6298\u53e0\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u6743\u91cd\u4e2d\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet\u4e0a\u7684DeiT\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u65e0\u8865\u507f\u65f6\u5355\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u526a\u679d\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u800cCORP\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u630150%MLP\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7ed3\u6784\u526a\u679d\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u4f7fDeiT-Huge\u4fdd\u630182.8%Top-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "CORP\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86ViT\u5728MLP\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u5197\u4f59\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5feb\u901f\u5b8c\u6210\u526a\u679d\uff08\u5355GPU 20\u5206\u949f\u5185\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

Safe deployment requires thorough testing in diverse real-world scenarios and compliance with traffic laws like speed limits, signal obedience, and right-of-way rules. Violations like running red lights or speeding pose severe safety risks. However, current testing approaches face significant challenges: limited ability to generate complex and high-risk law-breaking scenarios, and failing to account for complex interactions involving multiple vehicles and critical situations. To address these challenges, we propose ROMAN, a novel scenario generation approach for ADS testing that combines a multi-head attention network with a traffic law weighting mechanism. ROMAN is designed to generate high-risk violation scenarios to enable more thorough and targeted ADS evaluation. The multi-head attention mechanism models interactions among vehicles, traffic signals, and other factors. The traffic law weighting mechanism implements a workflow that leverages an LLM-based risk weighting module to evaluate violations based on the two dimensions of severity and occurrence. We have evaluated ROMAN by testing the Baidu Apollo ADS within the CARLA simulation platform and conducting extensive experiments to measure its performance. Experimental results demonstrate that ROMAN surpassed state-of-the-art tools ABLE and LawBreaker by achieving 7.91% higher average violation count than ABLE and 55.96% higher than LawBreaker, while also maintaining greater scenario diversity. In addition, only ROMAN successfully generated violation scenarios for every clause of the input traffic laws, enabling it to identify more high-risk violations than existing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Built on the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA), UniSurg introduces three key technical innovations tailored to surgical videos: 1) motion-guided latent prediction to prioritize semantically meaningful regions, 2) spatiotemporal affinity self-distillation to enforce relational consistency, and 3) feature diversity regularization to prevent representation collapse in texture-sparse surgical scenes. To enable large-scale pretraining, we curate UniSurg-15M, the largest surgical video dataset to date, comprising 3,658 hours of video from 50 sources across 13 anatomical regions. Extensive experiments across 17 benchmarks demonstrate that UniSurg significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on surgical workflow recognition (+14.6% F1 on EgoSurgery, +10.3% on PitVis), action triplet recognition (39.54% mAP-IVT on CholecT50), skill assessment, polyp segmentation, and depth estimation.

Recent 1.58-bit quantization techniques (e.g., BitNet b1.58) dramatically reduce memory footprint but typically incur a perplexity degradation of 20-25% compared to FP16 baselines. In this work, we introduce Hybrid Gated Flow (HGF), a dual-stream architecture that couples a 1.58-bit ternary backbone with a learnable, low-rank FP16 correction path controlled by adaptive gates.\n  Through extensive experiments on the TinyStories dataset across two training regimes (2500 and 3500 steps), we demonstrate that HGF 5.4 achieves a validation loss of 0.9306 compared to BitNet's 1.0294, recovering approximately 55% of the quality gap between pure ternary quantization and the FP16 baseline (0.8490). This recovery is achieved with only ~12-15% memory overhead beyond the ternary backbone.\n  Furthermore, we provide empirical evidence for an emergent phenomenon: quantization as structural regularization. While a full-precision differential attention baseline (Diff_Only) exhibited training instability with validation loss exceeding 1.68, the ternary-anchored HGF maintained robust convergence throughout training.

However, standard policy optimization methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), often converge to low-entropy policies, leading to severe mode collapse and limited output diversity. We analyze this issue from the perspective of sampling probability dynamics, identifying that the standard objective disproportionately reinforces the highest-likelihood paths, thereby suppressing valid alternative reasoning chains. To address this, we propose a novel Advantage Re-weighting Mechanism (ARM) designed to equilibrate the confidence levels across all correct responses. By incorporating Prompt Perplexity and Answer Confidence into the advantage estimation, our method dynamically reshapes the reward signal to attenuate the gradient updates of over-confident reasoning paths, while redistributing probability mass toward under-explored correct solutions. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances generative diversity and response entropy while maintaining competitive accuracy, effectively achieving a superior trade-off between exploration and exploitation in reasoning tasks. Empirical results on Qwen2.5 and DeepSeek models across mathematical and coding benchmarks show that ProGRPO significantly mitigates entropy collapse. Specifically, on Qwen2.5-7B, our method outperforms GRPO by 5.7% in Pass@1 and, notably, by 13.9% in Pass@32, highlighting its superior capability in generating diverse correct reasoning paths.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing 3D editing frameworks often face a difficult trade-off between visual controllability, geometric consistency, and scalability. Specifically, optimization-based methods are prohibitively slow, multi-view 2D propagation techniques suffer from visual drift, and training-free latent manipulation methods are inherently bound by frozen priors and cannot directly benefit from scaling. In this work, we present ShapeUP, a scalable, image-conditioned 3D editing framework that formulates editing as a supervised latent-to-latent translation within a native 3D representation. This formulation allows ShapeUP to build on a pretrained 3D foundation model, leveraging its strong generative prior while adapting it to editing through supervised training. In practice, ShapeUP is trained on triplets consisting of a source 3D shape, an edited 2D image, and the corresponding edited 3D shape, and learns a direct mapping using a 3D Diffusion Transformer (DiT). This image-as-prompt approach enables fine-grained visual control over both local and global edits and achieves implicit, mask-free localization, while maintaining strict structural consistency with the original asset.

As recent sequence-to-structure diffusion models provide powerful data-driven priors, posterior sampling has emerged as a popular framework by guiding atomic coordinates to target conformations using experimental likelihoods. However, when the target lies in a low-density region of the prior, posterior sampling requires aggressive and brittle weighting of the likelihood guidance. Motivated by this limitation, we propose EmbedOpt, an alternative inference-time approach for steering diffusion models to optimize experimental likelihoods in the conditional embedding space. As this space encodes rich sequence and coevolutionary signals, optimizing over it effectively shifts the diffusion prior to align with experimental constraints. We validate EmbedOpt on two benchmarks simulating cryo-electron microscopy map fitting and experimental distance constraints. We show that EmbedOpt outperforms the coordinate-based posterior sampling method in map fitting tasks, matches performance on distance constraint tasks, and exhibits superior engineering robustness across hyperparameters spanning two orders of magnitude.

However, understanding the temporal relationships of frames is crucial because it can help a model understand how an action is defined and therefore benefits localizing the full frames of an action. To this end, in this paper, we design a multi-task learning framework that fully utilizes point supervision to boost the model's temporal understanding capability for action localization.

In this paper, we propose Adaptive Global and Fine-grained perceptual Fusion for MLLM Embeddings (AGFF-Embed), a method that prompts the MLLM to generate multiple embeddings focusing on different dimensions of semantic information, which are then adaptively and smoothly aggregated. Furthermore, we adapt AGFF-Embed with the Explicit Gradient Amplification (EGA) technique to achieve in-batch hard negatives enhancement without requiring fine-grained editing of the dataset.

In this work, we introduce Sequential Flow Matching, a principled framework grounded in Bayesian filtering. By treating streaming inference as learning a probability flow that transports the predictive distribution from one time step to the next, our approach naturally aligns with the recursive structure of Bayesian belief updates. We provide theoretical justification that initializing generation from the previous posterior offers a principled warm start that can accelerate sampling compared to na\u00efve re-sampling. Across a wide range of forecasting, decision-making and state estimation tasks, our method achieves performance competitive with full-step diffusion while requiring only one or very few sampling steps, therefore with faster sampling.

Recent works, inspired by the strong capabilities of Generative Models (GMs), reformulate decision-making in OSRL as a conditional generative process, where GMs generate desirable actions conditioned on predefined reward and cost values. However, GM-assisted methods face two major challenges in OSRL: (1) lacking the ability to \"stitch\" optimal transitions from suboptimal trajectories within the dataset, and (2) struggling to balance reward targets with cost targets, particularly when they are conflict. To address these issues, we propose Goal-Assisted Stitching (GAS), a novel algorithm designed to enhance stitching capabilities while effectively balancing reward maximization and constraint satisfaction. To enhance the stitching ability, GAS first augments and relabels the dataset at the transition level, enabling the construction of high-quality trajectories from suboptimal ones. GAS also introduces novel goal functions, which estimate the optimal achievable reward and cost goals from the dataset. These goal functions, trained using expectile regression on the relabeled and augmented dataset, allow GAS to accommodate a broader range of reward-cost return pairs and achieve a better tradeoff between reward maximization and constraint satisfaction compared to human-specified values. The estimated goals then guide policy training, ensuring robust performance under constrained settings. Furthermore, to improve training stability and efficiency, we reshape the dataset to achieve a more uniform reward-cost return distribution.

In contrast, we leverage Flow Matching (FM) to learn a velocity field defined by an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE), enabling efficient generation of 3D pose samples with only a few integration steps. We propose a novel generative pose estimation framework, FMPose3D, that formulates 3D pose estimation as a conditional distribution transport problem.

Although ODE trajectories are deterministic, FMPose3D naturally generates various pose hypotheses by sampling different noise seeds. To obtain a single accurate prediction from those hypotheses, we further introduce a Reprojection-based Posterior Expectation Aggregation (RPEA) module, which approximates the Bayesian posterior expectation over 3D hypotheses. FMPose3D surpasses existing methods on the widely used human pose estimation benchmarks Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP, and further achieves state-of-the-art performance on the 3D animal pose datasets Animal3D and CtrlAni3D, demonstrating strong performance across both 3D pose domains.

However, VLMs remain brittle on allocentric spatial queries that require explicit perspective shifts, where the answer depends on reasoning in a target-centric frame rather than the observed camera view. Thus, we introduce Allocentric Perceiver, a training-free strategy that recovers metric 3D states from one or more images with off-the-shelf geometric experts, and then instantiates a query-conditioned allocentric reference frame aligned with the instruction's semantic intent. By deterministically transforming reconstructed geometry into the target frame and prompting the backbone VLM with structured, geometry-grounded representations, Allocentric Perceriver offloads mental rotation from implicit reasoning to explicit computation. We evaluate Allocentric Perciver across multiple backbone families on spatial reasoning benchmarks, observing consistent and substantial gains ($\\sim$10%) on allocentric tasks while maintaining strong egocentric performance, and surpassing both spatial-perception-finetuned models and state-of-the-art open-source and proprietary models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Allocentric Perceiver\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u53c2\u8003\u7cfb\u8f6c\u6362\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u76843D\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4ece\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u8f6c\u4e3a\u663e\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f02\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7a7a\u95f4\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7a7a\u95f4\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9700\u8981\u89c6\u89d2\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u5f02\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7a7a\u95f4\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0a\u4ecd\u5f88\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u4f9d\u8d56\u76ee\u6807\u4e2d\u5fc3\u53c2\u8003\u6846\u67b6\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u73b0\u6210\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4e13\u5bb6\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u5ea6\u91cf3D\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u4e0e\u6307\u4ee4\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u6761\u4ef6\u5f02\u4e2d\u5fc3\u53c2\u8003\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u91cd\u5efa\u51e0\u4f55\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5730\u8f6c\u6362\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u793a\u9aa8\u5e72VLM\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u589e\u76ca\uff08\u7ea610%\uff09\u7684\u5f02\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5f3a\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u53ca\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "Allocentric Perceiver\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5fc3\u7406\u65cb\u8f6c\u4ece\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u5378\u8f7d\u5230\u663e\u5f0f\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86VLMs\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u529b\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Two-stage approaches, training and validating GNNs for every pre-specified neighborhood scope to search for the best setting, is a time-consuming task and tends to be biased due to the search space design. How to adaptively determine proper neighborhood scopes for the aggregation process for both homophilic and heterophilic graphs remains largely unexplored. We thus propose to model the GNNs' message-passing behavior on a graph as a stochastic process by treating the number of hops as a beta process. This Bayesian framework allows us to infer the most plausible neighborhood scope for message aggregation simultaneously with the optimization of GNN parameters. Our theoretical analysis shows that the scope inference improves the expressivity of a GNN. Experiments on benchmark homophilic and heterophilic datasets show that the proposed method is compatible with state-of-the-art GNN variants, achieving competitive or superior performance on the node classification task, and providing well-calibrated predictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We propose Focus-Scan-Refine (FSR), a human-inspired, plug-and-play pruning framework that mimics how humans answer visual questions: focus on key evidence, then scan globally if needed, and refine the scanned context by aggregating relevant details. FSR first focuses on key evidence by combining visual importance with instruction relevance, avoiding the bias toward visually salient but query-irrelevant regions. It then scans for complementary context conditioned on the focused set, selecting tokens that are most different from the focused evidence. Finally, FSR refines the scanned context by aggregating nearby informative tokens into the scan anchors via similarity-based assignment and score-weighted merging, without increasing the token budget.

We present the Hinge Regression Tree (HRT), which reframes each split as a non-linear least-squares problem over two linear predictors whose max/min envelope induces ReLU-like expressive power. The resulting alternating fitting procedure is exactly equivalent to a damped Newton (Gauss-Newton) method within fixed partitions. We analyze this node-level optimization and, for a backtracking line-search variant, prove that the local objective decreases monotonically and converges; in practice, both fixed and adaptive damping yield fast, stable convergence and can be combined with optional ridge regularization. We further prove that HRT's model class is a universal approximator with an explicit $O(\u03b4^2)$ approximation rate, and show on synthetic and real-world benchmarks that it matches or outperforms single-tree baselines with more compact structures.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Each object is recorded in two complementary RGB sequences: (1) a handheld sequence, where the object is manipulated in front of a static camera, and (2) a board sequence, where the object is fixed on a ChArUco board to provide accurate camera poses via marker detection. The goal of NVS-HO is to learn a NVS model that captures the full appearance of an object from (1), whereas (2) provides the ground-truth images used for evaluation. To establish baselines, we consider both a classical SfM pipeline and a state-of-the-art pre-trained feed-forward neural network (VGGT) as pose estimators, and train NVS models based on NeRF and Gaussian Splatting. Our experiments reveal significant performance gaps in current methods under unconstrained handheld conditions, highlighting the need for more robust approaches. NVS-HO thus offers a challenging real-world benchmark to drive progress in RGB-based novel view synthesis of handheld objects.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While such details ease decision-making, they fundamentally contradict the goal for navigation in the real-world. Ideally, agents should possess the autonomy to navigate in unknown environments guided solely by simple and high-level intents. Realizing this ambition introduces a formidable challenge: Beyond-the-View Navigation (BVN), where agents must locate distant, unseen targets without dense and step-by-step guidance. Existing large language model (LLM)-based methods, though adept at following dense instructions, often suffer from short-sighted behaviors due to their reliance on short-horimzon supervision. Simply extending the supervision horizon, however, destabilizes LLM training. In this work, we identify that video generation models inherently benefit from long-horizon supervision to align with language instructions, rendering them uniquely suitable for BVN tasks. Capitalizing on this insight, we propose introducing the video generation model into this field for the first time. Yet, the prohibitive latency for generating videos spanning tens of seconds makes real-world deployment impractical. To bridge this gap, we propose SparseVideoNav, achieving sub-second trajectory inference guided by a generated sparse future spanning a 20-second horizon. This yields a remarkable 27x speed-up compared to the unoptimized counterpart. Extensive real-world zero-shot experiments demonstrate that SparseVideoNav achieves 2.5x the success rate of state-of-the-art LLM baselines on BVN tasks and marks the first realization of such capability in challenging night scenes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u8d85\u8d8a\u89c6\u91ce\u5bfc\u822a\uff08BVN\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u672a\u6765\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5SparseVideoNav\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u5c42\u610f\u56fe\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0d\u7b26\u5408\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u7406\u60f3\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e94\u8be5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u53ea\u6709\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u5c42\u610f\u56fe\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0b\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u81ea\u4e3b\u5bfc\u822a\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u89c6\u91ce\u5bfc\u822a\uff08BVN\uff09\u4efb\u52a1\u2014\u2014\u5373\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u9010\u6b65\u5bc6\u96c6\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8fdc\u5904\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c1\u76ee\u6807\u2014\u2014\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u77ed\u89c6\u754c\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u800c\u7b80\u5355\u5730\u6269\u5c55\u76d1\u7763\u89c6\u754c\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4LLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u5c06\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5f15\u5165\u8be5\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5176\u5929\u751f\u53d7\u76ca\u4e8e\u957f\u89c6\u754c\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u7279\u70b9\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u751f\u6210\u6570\u5341\u79d2\u89c6\u9891\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SparseVideoNav\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u672a\u6765\u8f68\u8ff9\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e9a\u79d2\u7ea7\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u63a8\u65ad\uff0820\u79d2\u89c6\u91ce\uff09\uff0c\u6bd4\u672a\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8627\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9645\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSparseVideoNav\u5728BVN\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u662f\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18LLM\u57fa\u7ebf\u76842.5\u500d\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u591c\u95f4\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd9\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "SparseVideoNav\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u4ec5\u51ed\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u5c42\u610f\u56fe\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0b\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u3001\u957f\u89c6\u754c\u5bfc\u822a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5728\u591c\u95f4\u573a\u666f\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

While recent research has leveraged text-centric Chain-of-Thought reasoning to augment these capabilities, such approaches frequently suffer from representational mismatch and restricted by limited perceptual acuity. To address these limitations, we propose Weaver, a novel, end-to-end trainable multimodal reasoning agentic system.

This paper empirically evaluates foundation models capable of modeling cross-channel correlations against a baseline LSTM with reversible instance normalization across Singaporean and Australian electricity markets at hourly and daily granularities. We systematically assess MOIRAI, MOMENT, TinyTimeMixers, ChronosX, and Chronos-2 under three feature configurations: all features, selected features, and target-only. Our findings reveal highly variable effectiveness: while Chronos-2 achieves the best performance among foundation models (in zero-shot settings), the simple baseline frequently outperforms all foundation models in Singapore's stable climate, particularly for short-term horizons. Model architecture proves critical, with synergistic architectural implementations (TTM's channel-mixing, Chronos-2's grouped attention) consistently leveraging exogenous features, while other approaches show inconsistent benefits. Geographic context emerges as equally important, with foundation models demonstrating advantages primarily in variable climates. These results challenge assumptions about universal foundation model superiority and highlight the need for domain-specific models, specifically in the energy domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, its effectiveness is severely hindered by inefficient credit assignment in long-horizon tasks and repetitive errors across tasks due to the lack of experience transfer. To address these challenges, we propose UI-Mem, a novel framework that enhances GUI online RL with a Hierarchical Experience Memory. Unlike traditional replay buffers, our memory accumulates structured knowledge, including high-level workflows, subtask skills, and failure patterns. These experiences are stored as parameterized templates that enable cross-task and cross-application transfer. To effectively integrate memory guidance into online RL, we introduce Stratified Group Sampling, which injects varying levels of guidance across trajectories within each rollout group to maintain outcome diversity, driving the unguided policy toward internalizing guided behaviors. Furthermore, a Self-Evolving Loop continuously abstracts novel strategies and errors to keep the memory aligned with the agent's evolving policy. Experiments on online GUI benchmarks demonstrate that UI-Mem significantly outperforms traditional RL baselines and static reuse strategies, with strong generalization to unseen applications.

However, the distributed nature of this approach still raises privacy and security issues, such as the exposure of sensitive data due to inference attacks and the influence of Byzantine behaviors on the trained model. In particular, achieving both secure aggregation and Byzantine resilience remains challenging, as existing solutions often address these aspects independently. In this work, we propose to address these challenges through a novel approach that combines homomorphic encryption for privacy-preserving aggregation with property-inference-inspired meta-classifiers for Byzantine filtering. First, following the property-inference attacks blueprint, we train a set of filtering meta-classifiers on labeled shadow updates, reproducing a diverse ensemble of Byzantine misbehaviors in FL, including backdoor, gradient-inversion, label-flipping and shuffling attacks. The outputs of these meta-classifiers are then used to cancel the Byzantine encrypted updates by reweighting. Second, we propose an automated method for selecting the optimal kernel and the dimensionality hyperparameters with respect to homomorphic inference, aggregation constraints and efficiency over the CKKS cryptosystem. Finally, we demonstrate through extensive experiments the effectiveness of our approach against Byzantine participants on the FEMNIST, CIFAR10, GTSRB, and acsincome benchmarks. More precisely, our SVM filtering achieves accuracies between $90$% and $94$% for identifying Byzantine updates at the cost of marginal losses in model utility and encrypted inference runtimes ranging from $6$ to $24$ seconds and from $9$ to $26$ seconds for an overall aggregation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6\u548c\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u8fc7\u6ee4\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u52a0\u5bc6\u66f4\u65b0\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c5e\u6027\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u5e76\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6076\u610f\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728CKKS\u5bc6\u7801\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e0a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u5185\u6838\u548c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u7136\u65e8\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7279\u6027\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5a01\u80c1\uff0c\u5982\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\u4ee5\u53ca\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u884c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5f80\u5f80\u5355\u72ec\u5904\u7406\u5b89\u5168\u805a\u5408\u548c\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e24\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "1. \u57fa\u4e8e\u5c5e\u6027\u63a8\u65ad\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u7ec4\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u5e26\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u5f71\u5b50\u66f4\u65b0\u6570\u636e\uff09\u6765\u6a21\u62df\u591a\u79cd\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u653b\u51fb\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b2. \u5229\u7528\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8f93\u51fa\u5bf9\u52a0\u5bc6\u66f4\u65b0\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\u4ee5\u62b5\u6d88\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u66f4\u65b0\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3aCKKS\u540c\u6001\u5bc6\u7801\u7cfb\u7edf\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u5185\u6838\u548c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3001\u805a\u5408\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u52a0\u5bc6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728FEMNIST\u3001CIFAR10\u3001GTSRB\u548cacsincome\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSVM\u8fc7\u6ee4\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bc6\u522b\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe\u523090%-94%\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u635f\u5931\u8f83\u5c0f\uff0c\u52a0\u5bc6\u63a8\u7406\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u57286-26\u79d2\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u6574\u4f53\u805a\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u805a\u5408\u4e0e\u62dc\u5360\u5ead\u97e7\u6027\u7684\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u6001\u52a0\u5bc6\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u8fc7\u6ee4\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u62b5\u5fa1\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We formalize when a candidate's rank is certifiably determined and design a query schedule that greedily maximizes information gain towards identifying the top-$m$ items. Our framework also gracefully handles non-transitive preferences - cycles induced by LLM judgments - by collapsing them into equivalence classes that yield principled tiered rankings.

However, it remains unclear whether it is intrinsic to the RL problem or exacerbated by specific training mechanisms. We investigate this question in offline goal-conditioned RL, where data distributions are fixed, and non-stationarity can be explicitly controlled via scheduled shifts in data quality. Additionally, we study varying data qualities under both stationary and non-stationary regimes, and cover two representative algorithms: HIQL (bootstrapped TD-learning) and QRL (quasimetric representation learning). Overall, we observe substantially greater robustness to changes in hyperparameter configurations than commonly reported for online RL, even under controlled non-stationarity. Once modest expert data is present ($\\approx$ 20\\%), QRL maintains broad, stable near-optimal regions, while HIQL exhibits sharp optima that drift significantly across training phases. To explain this divergence, we introduce an inter-goal gradient alignment diagnostic. We find that bootstrapped objectives exhibit stronger destructive gradient interference, which coincides directly with hyperparameter sensitivity. These results suggest that high sensitivity to changes in hyperparameter configurations during training is not inevitable in RL, but is amplified by the dynamics of bootstrapping, offering a pathway toward more robust algorithmic objective design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u9ad8\u56de\u62a5\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5e76\u975e\u5fc5\u7136\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u81ea\u4e3e\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u5e72\u6270\u653e\u5927\u6240\u81f4\uff0c\u800c\u51c6\u5ea6\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u9002\u5f53\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7a76\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7684\u6839\u6e90\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u662fRL\u95ee\u9898\u672c\u8eab\u56fa\u6709\u8fd8\u662f\u7531\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\u52a0\u5267\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6RL\u573a\u666f\u4e0b", "method": "\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u76ee\u6807\u6761\u4ef6RL\u4e2d\u63a7\u5236\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u56fa\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528HIQL\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u4e3e\u7684TD\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u548cQRL\uff08\u51c6\u5ea6\u91cf\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u4e24\u79cd\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u4e0b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u76ee\u6807\u95f4\u68af\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bca\u65ad", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u79bb\u7ebfRL\u5bf9\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6bd4\u5728\u7ebfRL\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u5f53\u5b58\u5728\u9002\u91cf\u4e13\u5bb6\u6570\u636e\uff08\u7ea620%\uff09\u65f6\uff0cQRL\u4fdd\u6301\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8fd1\u4f18\u533a\u57df\u800cHIQL\u5448\u73b0\u5c16\u9510\u6700\u4f18\u503c\u4e14\u968f\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u663e\u8457\u6f02\u79fb\uff1b\u81ea\u4e3e\u76ee\u6807\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u7834\u574f\u6027\u68af\u5ea6\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u4e0e\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u6027\u76f4\u63a5\u76f8\u5173", "conclusion": "RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u9ad8\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5e76\u975e\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u81ea\u4e3e\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u5e72\u6270\u653e\u5927\u6240\u81f4\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9014\u5f84"}}

Existing change detection methods rely on the Siamese encoder to individually extract temporal features followed by temporal fusion. Subsequently, these methods design sophisticated decoders to improve the change detection performance without taking into consideration the complexity of the model. These aforementioned issues intensify the overall computational cost as well as the network's complexity which is undesirable. Alternatively, few methods utilize the early fusion scheme to combine the temporal images. These methods prevent the extra overhead of Siamese encoder, however, they also rely on sophisticated decoders for better performance. In addition, these methods demonstrate inferior performance as compared to late fusion based methods. To bridge these gaps, we introduce encoder only change detection (EoCD) that is a simple and effective method for the change detection task. The proposed method performs the early fusion of the temporal data and replaces the decoder with a parameter-free multiscale feature fusion module thereby significantly reducing the overall complexity of the model. EoCD demonstrate the optimal balance between the change detection performance and the prediction speed across a variety of encoder architectures. Additionally, EoCD demonstrate that the performance of the model is predominantly dependent on the encoder network, making the decoder an additional component. Extensive experimentation on four challenging change detection datasets reveals the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Most existing RLVR methods, such as GRPO and its variants, ensure stable updates by constraining policy divergence through clipping likelihood ratios. This paper introduces a unified clipping framework that characterizes existing methods via a general notion of policy divergence, encompassing both likelihood ratios and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergences and extending to alternative measures. The framework provides a principled foundation for systematically analyzing how different policy divergence measures affect exploration and performance. We further identify the KL3 estimator, a variance-reduced Monte Carlo estimator of the KL divergence, as a key policy divergence constraint. We theoretically demonstrate that the KL3-based constraint is mathematically equivalent to an asymmetric ratio-based clipping that reallocates probability mass toward high-confidence actions, promoting stronger exploration while retaining the simplicity of GRPO-style methods. Empirical results on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that incorporating the KL3 estimator into GRPO improves both training stability and final performance, highlighting the importance of principled policy divergence constraints in policy optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Code is available at https://github.com/HT86159/EUQ", "summary": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown substantial advances in multimodal understanding and generation. However, when presented with incompetent or adversarial inputs, they frequently produce unreliable or even harmful content, such as fact hallucinations or dangerous instructions. This misalignment with human expectations, referred to as \\emph{misbehaviors} of LVLMs, raises serious concerns for deployment in critical applications. These misbehaviors are found to stem from epistemic uncertainty, specifically either conflicting internal knowledge or the absence of supporting information. However, existing uncertainty quantification methods, which typically capture only overall epistemic uncertainty, have shown limited effectiveness in identifying such issues. To address this gap, we propose Evidential Uncertainty Quantification (EUQ), a fine-grained method that captures both information conflict and ignorance for effective detection of LVLM misbehaviors. In particular, we interpret features from the model output head as either supporting (positive) or opposing (negative) evidence. Leveraging Evidence Theory, we model and aggregate this evidence to quantify internal conflict and knowledge gaps within a single forward pass. We extensively evaluate our method across four categories of misbehavior, including hallucinations, jailbreaks, adversarial vulnerabilities, and out-of-distribution (OOD) failures, using state-of-the-art LVLMs, and find that EUQ consistently outperforms strong baselines, showing that hallucinations correspond to high internal conflict and OOD failures to high ignorance. Furthermore, layer-wise evidential uncertainty dynamics analysis helps interpret the evolution of internal representations from a new perspective.

However, CLIP suffers from high memory and computation cost, which prohibits its usage to the resource-limited application scenarios. Existing CLIP compression methods typically reduce the size of pre-trained CLIP weights by selecting their subset as weight inheritance for further retraining via mask optimization or important weight measurement. However, these select-based weight inheritance often compromises the feature presentation ability, especially on the extreme compression. In this paper, we propose a novel mapping-based CLIP compression framework, CLIP-Map. It leverages learnable matrices to map and combine pretrained weights by Full-Mapping with Kronecker Factorization, aiming to preserve as much information from the original weights as possible. To mitigate the optimization challenges introduced by the learnable mapping, we propose Diagonal Inheritance Initialization to reduce the distribution shifting problem for efficient and effective mapping learning.

Continual Test-Time Adaptation(CTTA) has emerged as a promising approach to address cross-domain shifts during continually evolving target domains. Most existing CTTA methods rely on incrementally updating model parameters, which inevitably suffer from error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting, especially in long-term adaptation. Recent prompt-tuning-based works have shown potential to mitigate the two issues above by updating only visual prompts. While these approaches have demonstrated promising performance, several limitations remain:1)lacking multi-scale prompt diversity, 2)inadequate incorporation of instance-specific knowledge, and 3)risk of privacy leakage. To overcome these limitations, we propose Multi-scale Global-Instance Prompt Tuning(MGIPT), to enhance scale diversity of prompts and capture both global- and instance-level knowledge for robust CTTA. Specifically, MGIPT consists of an Adaptive-scale Instance Prompt(AIP) and a Multi-scale Global-level Prompt(MGP). AIP dynamically learns lightweight and instance-specific prompts to mitigate error accumulation with adaptive optimal-scale selection mechanism. MGP captures domain-level knowledge across different scales to ensure robust adaptation with anti-forgetting capabilities. These complementary components are combined through a weighted ensemble approach, enabling effective dual-level adaptation that integrates both global and local information.

Prior steering methods attempt to address this issue by applying a single, global vector to hidden representations -- an approach grounded in the restrictive linear representation hypothesis. In this work, we introduce FlowSteer, a nonlinear steering method that goes beyond uniform linear shifts by learning a complete transformation between the distributions associated with verbose and concise reasoning. This transformation is learned via Flow Matching as a velocity field, enabling precise, input-dependent control over the model's reasoning process. By aligning steered representations with the distribution of concise-reasoning activations, FlowSteer yields more compact reasoning than the linear shifts.

Despite its flexibility in allowing arbitrary source distributions, most existing approaches rely on a standard Gaussian distribution, a choice inherited from diffusion models, and rarely consider the source distribution itself as an optimization target in such settings. In this work, we show that principled design of the source distribution is not only feasible but also beneficial at the scale of modern text-to-image systems. Specifically, we propose learning a condition-dependent source distribution under flow matching objective that better exploit rich conditioning signals. We identify key failure modes that arise when directly incorporating conditioning into the source, including distributional collapse and instability, and show that appropriate variance regularization and directional alignment between source and target are critical for stable and effective learning. We further analyze how the choice of target representation space impacts flow matching with structured sources, revealing regimes in which such designs are most effective. Extensive experiments across multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate consistent and robust improvements, including up to a 3x faster convergence in FID, highlighting the practical benefits of a principled source distribution design for conditional flow matching.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u8bbe\u8ba1\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u6e90\u5206\u5e03\uff08\u800c\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u7a33\u5b9a\u52a0\u901f\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u6cbf\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ed8\u8ba4\u9ad8\u65af\u6e90\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u672a\u5c06\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff1b\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6761\u4ef6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6e90\u5206\u5e03\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u5728\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u76ee\u6807\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u6761\u4ef6\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u6e90\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u65b9\u5dee\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u6e90-\u76ee\u6807\u65b9\u5411\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ee5\u907f\u514d\u5206\u5e03\u574d\u7f29\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u5206\u6790\u76ee\u6807\u8868\u793a\u7a7a\u95f4\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6e90\u5206\u5e03\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5305\u62ecFID\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe3\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u6e90\u5206\u5e03\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e0d\u4ec5\u53ef\u884c\u4e14\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316\u6e90\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

However, its efficiency in exploration and difficulty adaptation remains an open challenge. In this work, we argue that these bottlenecks stem from an implicit advantage symmetry inherent in Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE). This symmetry induces two critical limitations: (i) at the group level, strict symmetry in weights between correct and incorrect trajectories leaves unsampled action logits unchanged, thereby hindering exploration of novel correct solution. (ii) at the sample level, the algorithm implicitly prioritizes medium-difficulty samples, remaining agnostic to the non-stationary demands of difficulty focus. Through controlled experiments, we reveal that this symmetric property is sub-optimal, yielding two pivotal insights: (i) asymmetrically suppressing the advantages of correct trajectories encourages essential exploration. (ii) learning efficiency is maximized by a curriculum-like transition-prioritizing simpler samples initially before gradually shifting to complex ones. Motivated by these findings, we propose Asymmetric GRAE (A-GRAE), which dynamically modulates exploration incentives and sample-difficulty focus.

LSA enhances temporal consistency by aligning semantic features between ground-truth and generated video clips. Specifically, we compare the output of an off-the-shelf feature extraction model between the ground-truth and generated video clips localized around dynamic objects inducing a semantic feature consistency loss. We fine-tune the base model by combining this loss with the standard diffusion loss. The model fine-tuned for a single epoch with our novel loss outperforms the baselines in common video generation evaluation metrics.

Existing multimodal large language models perform this mapping directly from screenshots but are trained without observing the visual outcomes of their generated code. In contrast, human developers iteratively render their implementation, compare it with the design, and learn how visual differences relate to code changes. Inspired by this process, we propose VisRefiner, a training framework that enables models to learn from visual differences between rendered predictions and reference designs. We construct difference-aligned supervision that associates visual discrepancies with corresponding code edits, allowing the model to understand how appearance variations arise from implementation changes. Building on this, we introduce a reinforcement learning stage for self-refinement, where the model improves its generated code by observing both the rendered output and the target design, identifying their visual differences, and updating the code accordingly. Experiments show that VisRefiner substantially improves single-step generation quality and layout fidelity, while also endowing models with strong self-refinement ability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of learning from visual differences for advancing screenshot-to-code generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our analysis reveals that this paradigm is limited due to stochastic inconsistency and poor alignment with human perception. To resolve these limitations, we introduce GenArena, a unified evaluation framework that leverages a pairwise comparison paradigm to ensure stable and human-aligned evaluation.

This structural discrepancy creates a critical \\textbf{student-teacher mismatch}: the teacher's inability to access long-term history prevents it from guiding the student on global temporal dependencies, effectively capping the student's context length. To resolve this, we propose \\textbf{Context Forcing}, a novel framework that trains a long-context student via a long-context teacher. By ensuring the teacher is aware of the full generation history, we eliminate the supervision mismatch, enabling the robust training of models capable of long-term consistency. To make this computationally feasible for extreme durations (e.g., 2 minutes), we introduce a context management system that transforms the linearly growing context into a \\textbf{Slow-Fast Memory} architecture, significantly reducing visual redundancy. Extensive results demonstrate that our method enables effective context lengths exceeding 20 seconds -- 2 to 10 times longer than state-of-the-art methods like LongLive and Infinite-RoPE.

Despite their effectiveness, they often exhibit a critical lack of 3D awareness. To this end, we introduce Splat and Distill, a framework that instills robust 3D awareness into 2D VFMs by augmenting the teacher model with a fast, feed-forward 3D reconstruction pipeline. Given 2D features produced by a teacher model, our method first lifts these features into an explicit 3D Gaussian representation, in a feedforward manner. These 3D features are then ``splatted\" onto novel viewpoints, producing a set of novel 2D feature maps used to supervise the student model, ``distilling\" geometrically grounded knowledge. By replacing slow per-scene optimization of prior work with our feed-forward lifting approach, our framework avoids feature-averaging artifacts, creating a dynamic learning process where the teacher's consistency improves alongside that of the student. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on a suite of downstream tasks, including monocular depth estimation, surface normal estimation, multi-view correspondence, and semantic segmentation. Our method significantly outperforms prior works, not only achieving substantial gains in 3D awareness but also enhancing the underlying semantic richness of 2D features.

Despite recent progress on diffusion-based distillation, this type of method typically depends on heuristic guidance or prototype assignment, which comes with time-consuming sampling and trajectory instability and thus hurts downstream generalization especially under strong control or low IPC. We propose \\emph{Path-Guided Flow Matching (PGFM)}, the first flow matching-based framework for generative distillation, which enables fast deterministic synthesis by solving an ODE in a few steps. PGFM conducts flow matching in the latent space of a frozen VAE to learn class-conditional transport from Gaussian noise to data distribution. Particularly, we develop a continuous path-to-prototype guidance algorithm for ODE-consistent path control, which allows trajectories to reliably land on assigned prototypes while preserving diversity and efficiency. Extensive experiments across high-resolution benchmarks demonstrate that PGFM matches or surpasses prior diffusion-based distillation approaches with fewer steps of sampling while delivering competitive performance with remarkably improved efficiency, e.g., 7.6$\\times$ more efficient than the diffusion-based counterparts with 78\\% mode coverage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5PGFM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u6b65\u957f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u7387\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u5f15\u5bfc\u6216\u539f\u578b\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u95f4\u8fc7\u957f\u3001\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5f3a\u63a7\u5236\u6216\u4f4eIPC\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5f71\u54cd\u4e0b\u6e38\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8def\u5f84\u5f15\u5bfc\u6d41\u5339\u914d(PGFM)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u51bb\u7ed3VAE\u7684\u9690\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7c7b\u522b\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u4ece\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u5230\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4f20\u8f93\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u8def\u5f84\u5230\u539f\u578b\u5f15\u5bfc\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0ODE\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u63a7\u5236", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPGFM\u5728\u8f83\u5c11\u91c7\u6837\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u53477.6\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u630178%\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u8986\u76d6\u7387", "conclusion": "PGFM\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u6548\u7387\u3001\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u6027\u80fd\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6848"}}

High-level intentions, such as affordance, define the goal, while coordinated balance, contact, and manipulation can emerge naturally from underlying physical and motor priors. Scaling such priors is key to enabling humanoids to compose and generalize loco-manipulation skills across diverse contexts while maintaining physically coherent whole-body coordination. To this end, we introduce InterPrior, a scalable framework that learns a unified generative controller through large-scale imitation pretraining and post-training by reinforcement learning. InterPrior first distills a full-reference imitation expert into a versatile, goal-conditioned variational policy that reconstructs motion from multimodal observations and high-level intent. While the distilled policy reconstructs training behaviors, it does not generalize reliably due to the vast configuration space of large-scale human-object interactions. To address this, we apply data augmentation with physical perturbations, and then perform reinforcement learning finetuning to improve competence on unseen goals and initializations. Together, these steps consolidate the reconstructed latent skills into a valid manifold, yielding a motion prior that generalizes beyond the training data, e.g., it can incorporate new behaviors such as interactions with unseen objects.

To address these issues, we propose Rewards as Labels (REAL), a novel framework that revisits verifiable rewards as categorical labels rather than scalar weights, thereby reformulating policy optimization as a classification problem. Building on this, we further introduce anchor logits to enhance policy learning. Our analysis reveals that REAL induces a monotonic and bounded gradient weighting, enabling balanced gradient allocation across rollouts and effectively mitigating the identified mismatches. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that REAL improves training stability and consistently outperforms GRPO and strong variants such as DAPO. On the 1.5B model, REAL improves average Pass@1 over DAPO by 6.7%. These gains further scale to 7B model, REAL continues to outperform DAPO and GSPO by 6.2% and 1.7%, respectively.

We propose GeoThinker, a framework that shifts the paradigm from passive fusion to active perception. Instead of feature mixing, GeoThinker enables the model to selectively retrieve geometric evidence conditioned on its internal reasoning demands. GeoThinker achieves this through Spatial-Grounded Fusion applied at carefully selected VLM layers, where semantic visual priors selectively query and integrate task-relevant geometry via frame-strict cross-attention, further calibrated by Importance Gating that biases per-frame attention toward task-relevant structures. Comprehensive evaluation results show that GeoThinker sets a new state-of-the-art in spatial intelligence, achieving a peak score of 72.6 on the VSI-Bench. Furthermore, GeoThinker demonstrates robust generalization and significantly improved spatial perception across complex downstream scenarios, including embodied referring and autonomous driving.

We show analytically that bilinear parameterizations possess a `non-mixing' property under gradient flow conditions, where functional components separate into orthogonal subspace representations. This provides a mathematical foundation for surgical model modification. We validate this hypothesis through a series of controlled experiments spanning modular arithmetic, cyclic reasoning, Lie group dynamics, and targeted unlearning benchmarks. Unlike pointwise nonlinear networks, multiplicative architectures are able to recover true operators aligned with the underlying algebraic structure.

We argue that the core limitation lies in a rigid, pre-defined reasoning pattern that cannot adaptively choose the most suitable thinking modality for different user queries. We introduce SwimBird, a reasoning-switchable MLLM that dynamically switches among three reasoning modes conditioned on the input: (1) text-only reasoning, (2) vision-only reasoning (continuous hidden states as visual thoughts), and (3) interleaved vision-text reasoning. To enable this capability, we adopt a hybrid autoregressive formulation that unifies next-token prediction for textual thoughts with next-embedding prediction for visual thoughts, and design a systematic reasoning-mode curation strategy to construct SwimBird-SFT-92K, a diverse supervised fine-tuning dataset covering all three reasoning patterns. By enabling flexible, query-adaptive mode selection, SwimBird preserves strong textual logic while substantially improving performance on vision-dense tasks.

While single-view perception is inherently 2D, reasoning over multiple views requires building a coherent scene understanding across viewpoints. In particular, we study perspective taking, where a model must build a coherent 3D understanding from multi-view observations and use it to reason from a new, language-specified viewpoint. We introduce CAMCUE, a pose-aware multi-image framework that uses camera pose as an explicit geometric anchor for cross-view fusion and novel-view reasoning. CAMCUE injects per-view pose into visual tokens, grounds natural-language viewpoint descriptions to a target camera pose, and synthesizes a pose-conditioned imagined target view to support answering. To support this setting, we curate CAMCUE-DATA with 27,668 training and 508 test instances pairing multi-view images and poses with diverse target-viewpoint descriptions and perspective-shift questions.

Building multimodal foundation models is a natural next step, but it faces key challenges: 1) lack of a unified multimodal pretraining paradigm and large-scale multimodal corpora for time series analysis; 2) how to effectively integrate heterogeneous modalities and enhance model generalization. To address these challenges, we take an early step toward multimodal foundation models for time series analysis. We first propose a multimodal pretraining paradigm that leverages time series with endogenous modalities (derived images and text) and exogenous knowledge (real-world news), providing a comprehensive multi-view perspective for time series analysis. To support this, we develop an automated data construction pipeline to curate MM-TS, the first large-scale multimodal time series dataset spanning six domains, with up to one billion points. Then we propose HORAI, a frequency-enhanced multimodal foundation model. It integrates two core components: the Frequency-enhanced Cross-Modality Encoder and the Time-Frequency Decoder, designed to effectively fuse multimodal features and enhance model generalization across modalities and domains.

Theoretical analysis of behavioral alignment evaluation", "summary": "Behavioral evaluation is the dominant paradigm for assessing alignment in large language models (LLMs). In practice, alignment is inferred from performance under finite evaluation protocols - benchmarks, red-teaming suites, or automated pipelines - and observed compliance is often treated as evidence of underlying alignment. This inference step, from behavioral evidence to claims about latent alignment properties, is typically implicit and rarely analyzed as an inference problem in its own right.\n  We study this problem formally. We frame alignment evaluation as an identifiability question under partial observability and allow agent behavior to depend on information correlated with the evaluation regime. Within this setting, we introduce the Alignment Verifiability Problem and the notion of Normative Indistinguishability, capturing when distinct latent alignment hypotheses induce identical distributions over all evaluator-accessible signals.\n  Our main result is a negative but sharply delimited identifiability theorem. Under finite behavioral evaluation and evaluation-aware agents, observed behavioral compliance does not uniquely identify latent alignment. That is, even idealized behavioral evaluation cannot, in general, certify alignment as a latent property.\n  We further show that behavioral alignment tests should be interpreted as estimators of indistinguishability classes rather than verifiers of alignment. Passing increasingly stringent tests may reduce the space of compatible hypotheses, but cannot collapse it to a singleton under the stated conditions. This reframes alignment benchmarks as providing upper bounds on observable compliance within a regime, rather than guarantees of underlying alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Sayed"], "title": "Tight Long-Term Tail Decay of (Clipped) SGD in Non-Convex Optimization", "comment": "32 pages", "summary": "The study of tail behaviour of SGD-induced processes has been attracting a lot of interest, due to offering strong guarantees with respect to individual runs of an algorithm. While many works provide high-probability guarantees, quantifying the error rate for a fixed probability threshold, there is a lack of work directly studying the probability of failure, i.e., quantifying the tail decay rate for a fixed error threshold. Moreover, existing results are of finite-time nature, limiting their ability to capture the true long-term tail decay which is more informative for modern learning models, typically trained for millions of iterations. Our work closes these gaps, by studying the long-term tail decay of SGD-based methods through the lens of large deviations theory, establishing several strong results in the process. First, we provide an upper bound on the tails of the gradient norm-squared of the best iterate produced by (vanilla) SGD, for non-convex costs and bounded noise, with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t/\\log(t)}$. Next, we relax the noise assumption by considering clipped SGD (c-SGD) under heavy-tailed noise with bounded moment of order $p \\in (1,2]$, showing an upper bound with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t^{\u03b2_p}/\\log(t)}$, where $\u03b2_p = \\frac{4(p-1)}{3p-2}$ for $p \\in (1,2)$ and $e^{-t/\\log^2(t)}$ for $p = 2$.

This paper proposes an any-quantile probabilistic forecasting framework for multi-regional PV power generation based on the Any-Quantile Recurrent Neural Network (AQ-RNN). The model integrates an any-quantile forecasting paradigm with a dual-track recurrent architecture that jointly processes series-specific and cross-regional contextual information, supported by dilated recurrent cells, patch-based temporal modeling, and a dynamic ensemble mechanism.\n  The proposed framework enables the estimation of calibrated conditional quantiles at arbitrary probability levels within a single trained model and effectively exploits spatial dependencies to enhance robustness at the system level. The approach is evaluated using 30 years of hourly PV generation data from 259 European regions and compared against established statistical and neural probabilistic baselines. The results demonstrate consistent improvements in forecast accuracy, calibration, and prediction interval quality, underscoring the suitability of the proposed method for uncertainty-aware energy management and operational decision-making in renewable-dominated power systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, the combinatorial explosion of model-data pairings makes exhaustive evaluation computationally prohibitive, preventing such assessments from becoming a routine pre-analysis step. To break this bottleneck, we reframe the challenge of FC benchmarking by selecting a small, representative core-set whose sole purpose is to preserve the relative performance ranking of FC operators. We formalize this as a ranking-preserving subset selection problem and propose Structure-aware Contrastive Learning for Core-set Selection (SCLCS), a self-supervised framework to select these core-sets. SCLCS first uses an adaptive Transformer to learn each sample's unique FC structure. It then introduces a novel Structural Perturbation Score (SPS) to quantify the stability of these learned structures during training, identifying samples that represent foundational connectivity archetypes. Finally, while SCLCS identifies stable samples via a top-k ranking, we further introduce a density-balanced sampling strategy as a necessary correction to promote diversity, ensuring the final core-set is both structurally robust and distributionally representative. On the large-scale REST-meta-MDD dataset, SCLCS preserves the ground-truth model ranking with just 10% of the data, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) core-set selection methods by up to 23.2% in ranking consistency (nDCG@k). To our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize core-set selection for FC operator benchmarking, thereby making large-scale operators comparisons a feasible and integral part of computational neuroscience.

Here we show that this belief can fail in a fundamental and irreversible way. We identify a structural regime in which standard inference procedures converge smoothly, remain well calibrated, and pass conventional diagnostic checks, yet systematically converge to incorrect conclusions. This failure arises when the reliability of observations degrades in a manner that is intrinsically unobservable to the inference process itself. Using minimal synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that in this regime additional data do not correct error but instead amplify it, while residual-based and goodness-of-fit diagnostics remain misleadingly normal. These results reveal an intrinsic limit of data-driven science: stability, convergence, and confidence are not sufficient indicators of epistemic validity.

Yet, real-world problems with high-dimensional observations, such as camera images, remain intractable for traditional belief- and filtering-based solvers. To tackle this problem, we introduce the Perception-based Beliefs for POMDPs framework (PBP), which complements such solvers with a perception model. This model takes the form of an image classifier which maps visual observations to probability distributions over states. PBP incorporates these distributions directly into belief updates, so the underlying solver does not need to reason explicitly over high-dimensional observation spaces. We show that the belief update of PBP coincides with the standard belief update if the image classifier is exact. Moreover, to handle classifier imprecision, we incorporate uncertainty quantification and introduce two methods to adjust the belief update accordingly. We implement PBP using two traditional POMDP solvers and empirically show that (1) it outperforms existing end-to-end deep RL methods and (2) uncertainty quantification improves robustness of PBP against visual corruption.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In industry deployments characterized by a limited number of entities possessing abundant data, the significance of a participant's role in shaping the global model becomes pivotal given that participation in a federation incurs costs, and participants may expect compensation for their involvement. Additionally, the contributions of participants serve as a crucial means to identify and address potential malicious actors and free-riders. However, fairly assessing individual contributions remains a significant hurdle. Recent works have demonstrated a considerable inherent instability in contribution estimations across aggregation strategies. While employing a different strategy may offer convergence benefits, this instability can have potentially harming effects on the willingness of participants in engaging in the federation. In this work, we introduce FedRandom, a novel mitigation technique to the contribution instability problem. Tackling the instability as a statistical estimation problem, FedRandom allows us to generate more samples than when using regular FL strategies.

While parameter-efficient tuning methods like low rank adaptation (LoRA) reduce computational demands, they lack mechanisms for strict continual learning and knowledge integration, without relying on data replay, or multiple adapters. We propose Share, a novel approach to parameter efficient continual finetuning that learns and dynamically updates a single, shared low-rank subspace, enabling seamless adaptation across multiple tasks and modalities. Share constructs a foundational subspace that extracts core knowledge from past tasks and incrementally integrates new information by identifying essential subspace directions. Knowledge from each new task is incorporated into this evolving subspace, facilitating forward knowledge transfer, while minimizing catastrophic interference. This approach achieves up to 100x parameter reduction and 281x memory savings over traditional LoRA methods, maintaining performance comparable to jointly trained models. A single Share model can replace hundreds of task-specific LoRA adapters, supporting scalable, asynchronous continual learning. Experiments across image classification, natural language understanding, 3D pose estimation, and text-to-image generation validate its effectiveness, making Share a practical and scalable solution for lifelong learning in large-scale AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u6301\u7eed\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5Share\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u5355\u4e2a\u5171\u4eab\u4f4e\u79e9\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u65e0\u7f1d\u9002\u5e94\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u5927\u578b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u548c\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u867d\u7136LoRA\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u8c03\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u5c11\u4e25\u683c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u96c6\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e14\u4ecd\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u636e\u56de\u653e\u6216\u591a\u4e2a\u9002\u914d\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u7840\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6765\u63d0\u53d6\u8fc7\u53bb\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u65b9\u5411\u9010\u6b65\u96c6\u6210\u65b0\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u90fd\u4f1a\u88ab\u6574\u5408\u5230\u8fd9\u4e2a\u4e0d\u65ad\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u4f4e\u79e9\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6b63\u5411\u77e5\u8bc6\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u707e\u96be\u6027\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfLoRA\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe100\u500d\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u51cf\u5c11\u548c281\u500d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u8282\u7701\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u3002\u5355\u4e2aShare\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u66ff\u4ee3\u6570\u767e\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684LoRA\u9002\u914d\u5668\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5f02\u6b65\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u30013D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u3002", "conclusion": "Share\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7ec8\u8eab\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We study how to incorporate group fairness constraints into boosting while preserving analyzable training dynamics. Our approach, FairBoost, projects the ensemble-induced exponential-weights distribution onto a convex set of distributions satisfying fairness constraints (as a reweighting surrogate), then trains weak learners on this fair distribution. The key theoretical insight is that projecting the training distribution reduces the effective edge of weak learners by a quantity controlled by the KL-divergence of the projection.

We study Muon in a linear associative memory model with softmax retrieval and a hierarchical frequency spectrum over query-answer pairs, with and without label noise. In this setting, we show that Gradient Descent (GD) learns frequency components at highly imbalanced rates, leading to slow convergence bottlenecked by low-frequency components. In contrast, the Muon optimizer mitigates this imbalance, leading to faster and more uniform progress. Specifically, in the noiseless case, Muon achieves an exponential speedup over GD; in the noisy case with a power-decay frequency spectrum, we derive Muon's optimization scaling law and demonstrate its superior scaling efficiency over GD. Furthermore, we show that Muon can be interpreted as an implicit matrix preconditioner arising from adaptive task alignment and block-symmetric gradient structure. In contrast, the preconditioner with coordinate-wise sign operator could match Muon under oracle access to unknown task representations, which is infeasible for SignGD in practice.

Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC) learns a latent representation via an autoencoder and performs clustering based on a $k$-means-like procedure, while the optimization is conducted in an end-to-end manner. This paper investigates whether the deep-learned representation has enabled DEC to overcome the known fundamental limitations of $k$-means clustering, i.e., its inability to discover clusters of arbitrary shapes, varied sizes and densities. Our investigations on DEC have a wider implication on deep clustering methods in general. Notably, none of these methods exploit the underlying data distribution.

In this paper, we study cross-domain offline RL, where an offline dataset from another similar source domain can be accessed to enhance policy learning upon a target domain dataset. Directly merging the two datasets may lead to suboptimal performance due to potential dynamics mismatches. Existing approaches typically mitigate this issue through source domain transition filtering or reward modification, which, however, may lead to insufficient exploitation of the valuable source domain data. Instead, we propose to modify the source domain data into the target domain data. To that end, we leverage an inverse policy model and a reward model to correct the actions and rewards of source transitions, explicitly achieving alignment with the target dynamics.

However, existing works in this field focus on the application of diffusion policies while leaving the diffusion critics unexplored. In fact, since policy optimization fundamentally relies on the critic, accurate value estimation is far more important than policy expressiveness. Furthermore, given the stochasticity of most reinforcement learning tasks, it has been confirmed that the critic is more appropriately depicted with a distributional model. Motivated by these points, we propose a novel distributional RL method with Diffusion Bridge Critics (DBC). DBC directly models the inverse cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the Q value. This allows us to accurately capture the value distribution and prevents it from collapsing into a trivial Gaussian distribution owing to the strong distribution-matching capability of the diffusion bridge. Moreover, we further derive an analytic integral formula to address discretization errors in DBC, which is essential in value estimation. To our knowledge, DBC is the first work to employ the diffusion bridge model as the critic. Notably, DBC is also a plug-and-play component and can be integrated into most existing RL frameworks. Experimental results on MuJoCo robot control benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DBC compared with previous distributional critic models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To understand the success of training, a \"loss landscape\" community has emerged to study the geometry of the loss function and the dynamics of optimization, often using visualization techniques. However, these loss landscape studies have mostly been limited to machine learning for image classification. In the newer field of physics-informed machine learning, little work has been conducted to visualize the landscapes of losses defined not by regression to large data sets, but by differential operators acting on state fields discretized by neural networks. In this work, we provide a comprehensive review of the loss landscape literature, as well as a discussion of the few existing physics-informed works which investigate the loss landscape. We then use a number of the techniques we survey to empirically investigate the landscapes defined by the Deep Ritz and squared residual forms of the physics loss function. We find that the loss landscapes of physics-informed neural networks have many of the same properties as the data-driven classification problems studied in the literature. Unexpectedly, we find that the two formulations of the physics loss often give rise to similar landscapes, which appear smooth, well-conditioned, and convex in the vicinity of the solution. The purpose of this work is to introduce the loss landscape perspective to the scientific machine learning community, compare the Deep Ritz and the strong form losses, and to challenge prevailing intuitions about the complexity of the loss landscapes of physics-informed networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recently, as diffusion language models (DLMs) have become an increasingly promising alternative to the autoregressive LLMs, it is essential to develop tailored mechanistic interpretability tools for this emerging class of models. In this work, we present DLM-Scope, the first SAE-based interpretability framework for DLMs, and demonstrate that trained Top-K SAEs can faithfully extract interpretable features. Notably, we find that inserting SAEs affects DLMs differently than autoregressive LLMs: while SAE insertion in LLMs typically incurs a loss penalty, in DLMs it can reduce cross-entropy loss when applied to early layers, a phenomenon absent or markedly weaker in LLMs. Additionally, SAE features in DLMs enable more effective diffusion-time interventions, often outperforming LLM steering. Moreover, we pioneer certain new SAE-based research directions for DLMs: we show that SAEs can provide useful signals for DLM decoding order; and the SAE features are stable during the post-training phase of DLMs. Our work establishes a foundation for mechanistic interpretability in DLMs and shows a great potential of applying SAEs to DLM-related tasks and algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDLM-Scope\u2014\u2014\u9996\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08DLM\uff09\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAE\uff09\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u53d6\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7279\u5f81\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u5bf9DLM\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u3001\u89e3\u7801\u987a\u5e8f\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u65b0\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08DLM\uff09\u6b63\u9010\u6e10\u6210\u4e3a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9DLM\u7684\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5de5\u5177\u3002\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAE\uff09\u5728LLM\u7684\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e2d\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e3aDLM\u5f00\u53d1\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u7684SAE\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DLM-Scope\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728DLM\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528Top-K\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAE\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728DLM\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u6548\u679c\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86SAE\u5728DLM\u548c\u81ea\u56de\u5f52LLM\u4e2d\u63d2\u5165\u65f6\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u5f71\u54cd\uff08DLM\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u63d2\u5165\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86SAE\u7279\u5f81\u5728\u6269\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u5e72\u9884\u3001\u89e3\u7801\u987a\u5e8f\u4fe1\u53f7\u63d0\u4f9b\u3001\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a\uff081\uff09DLM\u4e2dSAE\u63d2\u5165\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u5c42\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u8be5\u73b0\u8c61\u5728LLM\u4e2d\u4e0d\u660e\u663e\u6216\u4e0d\u5b58\u5728\uff1b\uff082\uff09DLM\u7684SAE\u7279\u5f81\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6269\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u6548\u679c\u4f18\u4e8eLLM\u5bfc\u5411\uff1b\uff083\uff09SAE\u53ef\u4e3aDLM\u89e3\u7801\u987a\u5e8f\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u7528\u4fe1\u53f7\uff1b\uff084\uff09SAE\u7279\u5f81\u5728DLM\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08DLM\uff09\u7684\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08SAE\uff09\u5728DLM\u76f8\u5173\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5de8\u5927\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

We introduce Constrained GRPO, a Lagrangian-based extension of GRPO for constrained policy optimization.

We show that a naive multi-component treatment in advantage estimation can break constrained learning: mismatched component-wise standard deviations distort the relative importance of the different objective terms, which in turn corrupts the Lagrangian signal and prevents meaningful constraint enforcement. We formally derive this effect to motivate our scalarized advantage construction that preserves the intended trade-off between reward and constraint terms. Experiments in a toy gridworld confirm the predicted optimization pathology and demonstrate that scalarizing advantages restores stable constraint control.

We first design KernelGYM, a robust distributed GPU environment that supports reward hacking check, data collection from multi-turn interactions and long-term RL training. Building on KernelGYM, we investigate effective multi-turn RL methods and identify a biased policy gradient issue caused by self-inclusion in GRPO.

Recent work has shown that over-parameterization via tensor lifting can convert such local minima into strict saddle points, an insight that also partially explains why massive scaling can improve generalization and performance in modern machine learning. Motivated by this observation, we propose a Simulated Oracle Direction (SOD) escape mechanism that simulates the landscape and escape direction of the over-parametrized space, without resorting to actually lifting the problem, since that would be computationally intractable. In essence, we designed a mathematical framework to project over-parametrized escape directions onto the original parameter space to guarantee a strict decrease of objective value from existing local minima. To the best of the our knowledge, this represents the first deterministic framework that could escape spurious local minima with guarantee, especially without using random perturbations or heuristic estimates. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our framework reliably escapes local minima and facilitates convergence to global optima, while incurring minimal computational cost when compared to explicit tensor over-parameterization. We believe this framework has non-trivial implications for nonconvex optimization beyond matrix sensing, by showcasing how simulated over-parameterization can be leveraged to tame challenging optimization landscapes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u5b9e\u9645\u5f20\u91cf\u5347\u7ef4\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u5411\u9003\u9038\u673a\u5236SOD\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f4e\u79e9\u77e9\u9635\u611f\u77e5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53ef\u9760\u9003\u9038\u865a\u5047\u5c40\u90e8\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\u5e76\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18", "motivation": "\u4f4e\u79e9\u77e9\u9635\u611f\u77e5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u4f18\u5316\u5730\u5f62\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u865a\u5047\u5c40\u90e8\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u96be\u4ee5\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff08\u5f20\u91cf\u5347\u7ef4\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u80fd\u5c06\u5c40\u90e8\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e25\u683c\u978d\u70b9\uff0c\u4f46\u76f4\u63a5\u5347\u7ef4\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u65e2\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4f18\u52bf\u53c8\u907f\u514d\u9ad8\u6602\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6a21\u62df\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u5411\uff08SOD\uff09\u9003\u9038\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u6a21\u62df\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5730\u5f62\u548c\u9003\u9038\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5b9e\u9645\u8fdb\u884c\u5f20\u91cf\u5347\u7ef4\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u9003\u9038\u65b9\u5411\u6295\u5f71\u56de\u539f\u59cb\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4ece\u73b0\u6709\u5c40\u90e8\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\u4e25\u683c\u964d\u4f4e\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u503c\uff0c\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5177\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6027\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9003\u9038\u865a\u5047\u5c40\u90e8\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\u6846\u67b6", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eSOD\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u9003\u9038\u5c40\u90e8\u6781\u5c0f\u503c\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5168\u5c40\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u663e\u5f0f\u5f20\u91cf\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u6781\u4f4e\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u79e9\u77e9\u9635\u611f\u77e5\u7b49\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u62df\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u9a6f\u670d\u590d\u6742\u4f18\u5316\u5730\u5f62\uff0c\u4e3a\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6df1\u8fdc\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bba\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u65e0\u9700\u5b9e\u9645\u5347\u7ef4\u5373\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u5728\u77e9\u9635\u611f\u77e5\u4e4b\u5916\u7684\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd"}}

Recent distributional RL methods improve robustness by modeling values with multiple quantile points, but they still learn each quantile independently as a scalar. This results in rough-grained value representations that lack fine-grained conditioning on state information, struggling under complex and OOD conditions. We propose DFPO (Distributional Value Flow Policy Optimization with Conditional Risk and Consistency Control), a robust distributional RL framework that models values as continuous flows across time steps. By scaling value modeling through learning of a value flow field instead of isolated quantile predictions, DFPO captures richer state information for more accurate advantage estimation. To stabilize training under noisy feedback, DFPO further integrates conditional risk control and consistency constraints along value flow trajectories. Experiments on dialogue, math reasoning, and scientific tasks show that DFPO outperforms PPO, FlowRL, and other robust baselines under noisy supervision, achieving improved training stability and generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

ContextBench augments existing end-to-end benchmarks with intermediate gold-context metrics that unbox the issue-resolution process.

Post-training quantization (PTQ) enables efficient inference by mapping pretrained weights to low-bit formats without retraining, but its effectiveness depends critically on both the quantization objective and the rounding procedure used to obtain low-bit weight representations. In this work, we show that interpolating between symmetric and asymmetric calibration acts as a form of regularization that preserves the standard quadratic structure used in PTQ while providing robustness to activation mismatch. Building on this perspective, we derive a simple successive rounding procedure that naturally incorporates asymmetric calibration, as well as a bounded-search extension that allows for an explicit trade-off between quantization quality and the compute cost. Experiments across multiple LLM families, quantization bit-widths, and benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed bounded search based on a regularized asymmetric calibration objective consistently improves perplexity and accuracy over PTQ baselines, while incurring only modest and controllable additional computational cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9LLM\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e0e\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u89c4\u6574\u5316\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u820d\u5165\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6709\u9650\u641c\u7d22\u6269\u5c55\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u91cf\u5316\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u5341\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u4e0e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6210\u672c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6548\u679c\u5f88\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e0a\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u820d\u5165\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u9009\u62e9", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e0e\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6821\u51c6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u63d2\u503c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c4\u6574\u5316\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u4f20\u7edf\u4e8c\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u6fc0\u6d3b\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u63d0\u51fa\u8fde\u7eed\u820d\u5165\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u878d\u5408\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u9650\u641c\u7d22\u6269\u5c55\u6765\u660e\u786e\u6743\u8861\u91cf\u5316\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2aLLM\u5bb6\u65cf\u3001\u91cf\u5316\u4f4d\u6570\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u6574\u5316\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6821\u51c6\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6709\u9650\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ec5\u4ea7\u751f\u9002\u5ea6\u4e14\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u989d\u5916\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c4\u6574\u5316\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u6709\u9650\u641c\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6491"}}

It is a crucial question whether -- or to what extent -- sample-based training is able to capture the true structure of these languages, often referred to as the ``world model''. Theoretical results indicate that we can hope for soundness at best, that is, generating valid sequences, but not necessarily all of them. However, it is still important to have practical tools that are able to verify whether a given sequence model is sound. In this study, we focus on chess, as it is a domain that provides enough complexity while having a simple rule-based world model. We propose adversarial sequence generation for verifying the soundness of the sequence model. Our adversaries generate valid sequences so as to force the sequence model to generate an invalid next move prediction. Apart from the falsification of soundness, this method is also suitable for a more fine-grained analysis of the failure modes and the effects of different choices during training. To demonstrate this, we propose a number of methods for adversarial sequence generation and evaluate the approach on a large set of chess models. We train models on random as well as high-quality chess games, using several training recipes. We find that none of the models are sound, but some training techniques and dataset choices are able to improve soundness remarkably. We also investigate the potential application of board state probes in both our training and attack methods. Our findings indicate that the extracted board states have no causal role in next token prediction in most of the models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

But these datasets encode incidental patterns alongside intended ones: correlations between formatting and content, narrow phrasings across diverse problems, and implicit associations arising from the discrete data curation process. These patterns are often invisible to developers yet salient to models, producing behaviors that surprise their creators, such as rejecting true facts presented in a particular question format.

While this approach has been adopted in training advanced LLMs such as Kimi K1.5/K2, the ideal closed-form PMD updates require reliable partition function estimation, a significant challenge when working with limited rollouts in the vast action spaces of LLMs. We investigate a practical algorithm, termed PMD-mean, that approximates the log-partition term with the mean reward under the sampling policy and performs regression in log-policy space. Specifically, we characterize the population solution of PMD-mean and demonstrate that it implicitly optimizes mirror descent subproblems with an adaptive mixed KL--$\u03c7^2$ regularizer. This additional $\u03c7^2$ regularization constrains large probability changes, producing more conservative updates when expected rewards are low and enhancing robustness against finite-sample estimation errors. Experiments on math reasoning tasks show that PMD-mean achieves superior performance with improved stability and time efficiency.

To address this, we propose Orthogonal Model Merging (OrthoMerge), a method that performs merging operations on the Riemannian manifold formed by the orthogonal group to preserve the geometric structure of the model's weights. By mapping task-specific orthogonal matrices learned by Orthogonal Finetuning (OFT) to the Lie algebra, OrthoMerge enables a principled yet efficient integration that takes into account both the direction and intensity of adaptations. In addition to directly leveraging orthogonal matrices obtained by OFT, we further extend this approach to general models finetuned with non-OFT methods (i.e., low-rank finetuning, full finetuning) via an Orthogonal-Residual Decoupling strategy. This technique extracts the orthogonal components of expert models by solving the orthogonal Procrustes problem, which are then merged on the manifold of the orthogonal group, while the remaining linear residuals are processed through standard additive merging. Extensive empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of OrthoMerge in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and maintaining model performance across diverse tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We propose \"Diamond Maps\", stochastic flow map models that enable efficient and accurate alignment to arbitrary rewards at inference time. Diamond Maps amortize many simulation steps into a single-step sampler, like flow maps, while preserving the stochasticity required for optimal reward alignment. This design makes search, sequential Monte Carlo, and guidance scalable by enabling efficient and consistent estimation of the value function.

These limitations are usually attributed to message passing; in this work we show that an independent bottleneck arises at the readout stage. Using finite-dimensional representation theory, we prove that all linear permutation-invariant readouts, including sum and mean pooling, factor through the Reynolds (group-averaging) operator and therefore project node embeddings onto the fixed subspace of the permutation action, erasing all non-trivial symmetry-aware components regardless of encoder expressivity. This yields both a new expressivity barrier and an interpretable characterization of what global pooling preserves or destroys. To overcome this collapse, we introduce projector-based invariant readouts that decompose node representations into symmetry-aware channels and summarize them with nonlinear invariant statistics, preserving permutation invariance while retaining information provably invisible to averaging.

Classical asymptotic theory for sample means can fail because arm-specific sample sizes are random and coupled with the rewards through the action-selection rule. We study this phenomenon in the $K$-armed Gaussian bandit and identify \\emph{optimism} as a key mechanism for restoring \\emph{stability}, a sufficient condition for valid asymptotic inference requiring each arm's pull count to concentrate around a deterministic scale. First, we prove that variance-inflated TS \\citep{halder2025stable} is stable for any $K \\ge 2$, including the challenging regime where multiple arms are optimal. This resolves the open question raised by \\citet{halder2025stable} through extending their results from the two-armed setting to the general $K$-armed setting. Second, we analyze an alternative optimistic modification that keeps the posterior variance unchanged but adds an explicit mean bonus to posterior mean, and establish the same stability conclusion.

Recent years have seen the rise of a new family of amortised sampling algorithms, commonly referred to as diffusion samplers, that enable fast and efficient sampling from an unnormalised density. Such algorithms have been widely studied for continuous-space sampling tasks; however, their application to problems in discrete space remains largely unexplored. Although some progress has been made in this area, discrete diffusion samplers do not take full advantage of ideas commonly used for continuous-space sampling. In this paper, we propose to bridge this gap by introducing off-policy training techniques for discrete diffusion samplers. We show that these techniques improve the performance of discrete samplers on both established and new synthetic benchmarks. Next, we generalise discrete diffusion samplers to the task of bridging between two arbitrary distributions, introducing data-to-energy Schr\u00f6dinger bridge training for the discrete domain for the first time. Lastly, we showcase the application of the proposed diffusion samplers to data-free posterior sampling in the discrete latent spaces of image generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Inference-time steering offers a lightweight alternative, yet most existing methods optimize proxies for correctness rather than correctness itself. We introduce CORAL (Correctness-Optimized Residual Activation Lens), a regularized inference-time steering method that captures distributed correctness signals from model internal activations using weight-decay MLP probes. We evaluate CORAL across three 7B-parameter models and find that it consistently improves accuracy by 10\\% and expected calibration error (ECE) by 50\\% on average. We additionally demonstrate that these gains transfer without retraining to the complete published test sets of four held-out benchmarks (ARC-Challenge, HellaSwag, Math-MC, OpenBookQA), averaging 14\\% accuracy improvements and 49\\% ECE improvements.

In contrast, enhancing their predictive performance on downstream tasks typically involves adapting their knowledge through fine-tuning. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), aim to reduce the computational cost of this process by freezing the pre-trained model and updating a smaller number of parameters. In comparison to full fine-tuning, these methods achieve over 99\\% reduction in trainable parameter count, depending on the configuration. Unfortunately, such a reduction may prove insufficient as LLMs continue to grow in scale. In this work, we address the previous problem by systematically selecting only a few layers to fine-tune using LoRA or its variants. We argue that not all layers contribute equally to the model adaptation. Leveraging this, we identify the most relevant layers to fine-tune by measuring their contribution to changes in internal representations. Our method is orthogonal to and readily compatible with existing low-rank adaptation techniques. We reduce the trainable parameters in LoRA-based techniques by up to 50\\%, while maintaining the predictive performance across different models and tasks. Specifically, on encoder-only architectures, this reduction in trainable parameters leads to a negligible predictive performance drop on the GLUE benchmark. On decoder-only architectures, we achieve a small drop or even improvements in the predictive performance on mathematical problem-solving capabilities and coding tasks. Finally, this effectiveness extends to multimodal models, for which we also observe competitive results relative to fine-tuning with LoRA modules in all layers.

However, when utilised within skipless architectures, which aim to improve representation learning, recent work has highlighted the inherent instability of SSA due to inducing rank collapse and poorly-conditioned Jacobians. In this work, we design a novel attention mechanism: Orthogonal Self-Attention (OSA), which aims to bypass these issues with SSA, in order to allow for (non-causal) Transformers without skip connections and normalisation layers to be more easily trained. In particular, OSA parametrises the attention matrix to be orthogonal via mapping a skew-symmetric matrix, formed from query-key values, through the matrix exponential. We show that this can be practically implemented, by exploiting the low-rank structure of our query-key values, resulting in the computational complexity and memory cost of OSA scaling linearly with sequence length. Furthermore, we derive an initialisation scheme for which we prove ensures that the Jacobian of OSA is well-conditioned.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08OSA\uff09\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u77e9\u9635\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u4e3a\u6b63\u4ea4\u77e9\u9635\u6765\u89e3\u51b3Softmax\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u65e0\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u79e9\u5d29\u6e83\u548c\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u75c5\u6001\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u826f\u597d\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfSoftmax\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u65e0\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5\u3001\u65e0\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5c42\u7684Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u79e9\u5d29\u6e83\u548c\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u75c5\u6001\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8fd9\u7c7b\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u6765\u89c4\u907f\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u659c\u5bf9\u79f0\u77e9\u9635\u6620\u5c04\u4e3a\u77e9\u9635\u6307\u6570\u6765\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6b63\u4ea4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u77e9\u9635\u3002\u5229\u7528\u67e5\u8be2-\u952e\u503c\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6210\u672c\u3002\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u826f\u597d\u6761\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u6b63\u4ea4\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u907f\u514d\u79e9\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u826f\u597d\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u65e0\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5\u3001\u65e0\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5c42\u7684Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u5bb9\u6613\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6b63\u4ea4\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e3aTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u8df3\u8dc3\u8fde\u63a5\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u66f4\u7b80\u5355Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

A key challenge in recent research is how to effectively leverage and aggregate token embeddings from language models to obtain the OOD score. In this work, we propose AP-OOD, a novel OOD detection method for natural language that goes beyond simple average-based aggregation by exploiting token-level information. AP-OOD is a semi-supervised approach that flexibly interpolates between unsupervised and supervised settings, enabling the use of limited auxiliary outlier data. Empirically, AP-OOD sets a new state of the art in OOD detection for text: in the unsupervised setting, it reduces the FPR95 (false positive rate at 95% true positives) from 27.84% to 4.67% on XSUM summarization, and from 77.08% to 70.37% on WMT15 En-Fr translation.", "AI": {"tldr": "AP-OOD\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6807\u8bb0\u7ea7\u4fe1\u606f\u8d85\u8d8a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u805a\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7075\u6d3b\u5229\u7528\u6709\u9650\u5f02\u5e38\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u6587\u672cOOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dOOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u662f\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u548c\u805a\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u83b7\u5f97OOD\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u8d8a\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAP-OOD\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6807\u8bb0\u7ea7\u4fe1\u606f\u7075\u6d3b\u5730\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u8bbe\u7f6e\u95f4\u63d2\u503c\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5229\u7528\u6709\u9650\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u5f02\u5e38\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0cAP-OOD\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff1a\u5728XSUM\u6458\u8981\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c06FPR95\u4ece27.84%\u964d\u81f34.67%\uff0c\u5728WMT15 En-Fr\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c06FPR95\u4ece77.08%\u964d\u81f370.37%\u3002", "conclusion": "AP-OOD\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528\u6807\u8bb0\u7ea7\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

Recent work has shown that supervised fine-tuning can improve model performance on simple physical tasks.

Based on research in cognitive science, we hypothesize that models need to interact with an environment to properly learn its physical dynamics. We train models that learn through interaction with the environment using reinforcement learning. While learning from interaction allows models to improve their within-task performance, it fails to produce models with generalizable physical intuitions.
