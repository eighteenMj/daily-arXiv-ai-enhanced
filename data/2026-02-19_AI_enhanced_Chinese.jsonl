Service operators face a fundamental tension: enforcing Sybil resistance (one-person-one-account) while preserving user privacy, yet keeping on-chain verification cost and admission latency predictable at scale. Existing credential-based ZK admission approaches typically require per-request on-chain verification, making the provisioning cost grow with the number of concurrent joiners. We present \\textbf{ZK-AMS}, a scalable admission and provisioning layer that bridges real-world \\emph{Personhood Credentials} to anonymous on-chain service accounts. ZK-AMS combines (i) zero-knowledge credential validation, (ii) a \\emph{permissionless} batch submitter model, and (iii) a decentralized, privacy-preserving folding pipeline that uses Nova-style recursive aggregation together with multi-key homomorphic encryption, enabling batch settlement with \\emph{constant} on-chain verification per batch. We implement ZK-AMS end-to-end on an Ethereum testbed and evaluate admission throughput, end-to-end latency, and gas consumption. Results show stable verification cost across batch sizes and substantially improved admission efficiency over non-recursive baselines, providing a practical and cost-predictable admission service for large-scale Web 3.0 communities.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To mitigate the coverage limitations of fixed terrestrial macro base stations (MBS) under non line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions, fleets of unmanned aerial base stations (UABSs) can be deployed as aerial base stations, dynamically repositioning to track vehicular users and traffic hotspots in coordination with the terrestrial network. This paper addresses cooperative multi-agent trajectory design under different service areas and takeoff configurations, where rapid and safe adaptation across scenarios is essential. We formulate the problem as a multi-task decentralized partially observable Markov decision process and solve it using centralized training and decentralized execution with double dueling deep Q-network (3DQN), enabling online training for real-world deployments. However, efficient exploration remains a bottleneck, with conventional strategies like $\u03b5$-greedy requiring careful tuning. To overcome this, we propose the multi-agent meta-advisor with advisor override (MAMO). This framework guides agent exploration through a meta-policy learned jointly across tasks. It uses a dynamic override mechanism that allows agents to reject misaligned guidance when the advisor fails to generalize to a specific scenario. Simulation results across three realistic urban scenarios and multiple takeoff configurations show that MAMO achieves faster convergence and higher returns than tuned $\u03b5$-greedy baselines, outperforming both an advisor-only ablation and a single generalized policy. Finally, we demonstrate that the learned UABS fleet significantly improves network performance compared to deployments without aerial support.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To be specific, a variable neighborhood descent (VND) heuristic is proposed for the general routing phase, while a second-order cone programming (SOCP) procedure is applied in the close-enough routing phase. These two phases are performed in an iterative fashion under the framework of an adaptive iterated local search (AILS) algorithm until the predefined termination criteria are satisfied.

We introduce FlipSet, a diagnostic benchmark for Level-2 visual perspective taking (L2 VPT) in vision-language models. The task requires simulating 180-degree rotations of 2D character strings from another agent's perspective, isolating spatial transformation from 3D scene complexity. Evaluating 103 VLMs reveals systematic egocentric bias: the vast majority perform below chance, with roughly three-quarters of errors reproducing the camera viewpoint. Control experiments expose a compositional deficit--models achieve high theory-of-mind accuracy and above-chance mental rotation in isolation, yet fail catastrophically when integration is required. This dissociation indicates that current VLMs lack the mechanisms needed to bind social awareness to spatial operations, suggesting fundamental limitations in model-based spatial reasoning.

However, their advantages under complex constraints remain nascent, for which current constraint-handling schemes via feasibility masking or implicit feasibility awareness can be inefficient or inapplicable for hard constraints. In this paper, we present Construct-and-Refine (CaR), the first general and efficient constraint-handling framework for neural routing solvers based on explicit learning-based feasibility refinement. Unlike prior construction-search hybrids that target reducing optimality gaps through heavy improvements yet still struggle with hard constraints, CaR achieves efficient constraint handling by designing a joint training framework that guides the construction module to generate diverse and high-quality solutions well-suited for a lightweight improvement process, e.g., 10 steps versus 5k steps in prior work. Moreover, CaR presents the first use of construction-improvement-shared representation, enabling potential knowledge sharing across paradigms by unifying the encoder, especially in more complex constrained scenarios. We evaluate CaR on typical hard routing constraints to showcase its broader applicability. Results demonstrate that CaR achieves superior feasibility, solution quality, and efficiency compared to both classical and neural state-of-the-art solvers.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aConstruct-and-Refine\uff08CaR\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u795e\u7ecf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u8def\u7531\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002CaR\u91c7\u7528\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7ec6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u6307\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4e14\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u8fc7\u7a0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5904\u7406\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u8def\u7531\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u63a9\u7801\u6216\u9690\u5f0f\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6848\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u795e\u7ecf\u8def\u7531\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7ea6\u675f\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "CaR\u6846\u67b6\u91c7\u7528\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7ec6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u6784\u9020\u6a21\u5757\uff08construction module\uff09\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4e14\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6848\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff08\u4f8b\u598210\u6b65\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4e4b\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u76845\u5343\u6b65\uff09\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cCaR\u9996\u6b21\u5f15\u5165\u6784\u9020-\u6539\u8fdb\u5171\u4eab\u8868\u793a\uff08construction-improvement-shared representation\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5178\u578b\u7684\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\u8def\u7531\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30CaR\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aCaR\u5728\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3001\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u72b6\u6001\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "CaR\u662f\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u8def\u7531\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7ea6\u675f\u5904\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u5f0f\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7ec6\u5316\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u3002"}}

The interaction of the surgical device with soft tissue is elevated to an augmented state space with a Koopman operator formulation, allowing linear prediction and control of the dynamics that are nonlinear by nature. To make the rendered forces consistent with human perceptual limits, we put forward a Bayesian calibration module based on WeberFechner and Stevens scaling laws, which progressively shape force signals relative to each individual's discrimination thresholds. For various simulated surgical tasks such as palpation, incision, and bone milling, the proposed system attains an average rendering latency of 4.3 ms, a force error of less than 2.8% and a 20% improvement in perceptual discrimination. Multivariate statistical analyses (MANOVA and regression) reveal that the system's performance is significantly better than that of conventional spring-damper and energy, based rendering methods.

At pre-processing stage, we utilize error-bounded quantization to reduce the amount of data to be processed and therefore improve computational efficiencies. At the compression stage, our methodology combines object extraction with multiple state-of-the-art lossless and lossy compressors, resulting in significantly improved compression ratios.

However, existing approaches often suffer from limited accuracy and poor generalization due to significant distribution shifts among samples generated by diverse forgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multivariate and Soft Blending Augmentation with CLIP-guided Forgery Intensity Estimation (MSBA-CLIP) framework. Our method leverages the multimodal alignment capabilities of CLIP to capture subtle forgery traces. We introduce a Multivariate and Soft Blending Augmentation (MSBA) strategy that synthesizes images by blending forgeries from multiple methods with random weights, forcing the model to learn generalizable patterns. Furthermore, a dedicated Multivariate Forgery Intensity Estimation (MFIE) module is designed to explicitly guide the model in learning features related to varied forgery modes and intensities.

We investigate optimization instability, a phenomenon in which continued autonomous improvement paradoxically degrades classifier performance, using Pythia, an open-source framework for automated prompt optimization. Evaluating three clinical symptoms with varying prevalence (shortness of breath at 23%, chest pain at 12%, and Long COVID brain fog at 3%), we observed that validation sensitivity oscillated between 1.0 and 0.0 across iterations, with severity inversely proportional to class prevalence. At 3% prevalence, the system achieved 95% accuracy while detecting zero positive cases, a failure mode obscured by standard evaluation metrics. We evaluated two interventions: a guiding agent that actively redirected optimization, amplifying overfitting rather than correcting it, and a selector agent that retrospectively identified the best-performing iteration successfully prevented catastrophic failure. With selector agent oversight, the system outperformed expert-curated lexicons on brain fog detection by 331% (F1) and chest pain by 7%, despite requiring only a single natural language term as input. These findings characterize a critical failure mode of autonomous AI systems and demonstrate that retrospective selection outperforms active intervention for stabilization in low-prevalence classification tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u81ea\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u5b58\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u6301\u7eed\u81ea\u4e3b\u4f18\u5316\u53cd\u800c\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u7c7b\u522b\u4f4e\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u65f6\u5c24\u4e3a\u4e25\u91cd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u56de\u987e\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u6bd4\u4e3b\u52a8\u5e72\u9884\u66f4\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9632\u6b62\u7cfb\u7edf\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u4e3b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u867d\u7136\u524d\u666f\u5e7f\u9614\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5373\u6301\u7eed\u81ea\u4e3b\u6539\u8fdb\u53cd\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Pythia\u5f00\u653e\u6e90\u7801\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u53d1\u751f\u7387\uff0823%\u300112%\u30013%\uff09\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u75c7\u72b6\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5e72\u9884\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u6307\u5bfc\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff08\u4e3b\u52a8\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff08\u56de\u987e\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u8fed\u4ee3\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u57283%\u4f4e\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u65f6\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fbe\u523095%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5374\u672a\u80fd\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u4efb\u4f55\u9633\u6027\u75c5\u4f8b\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u6807\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u6613\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u6307\u5bfc\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4f1a\u52a0\u5267\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\uff0c\u800c\u9009\u62e9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u9632\u6b62\u707e\u96be\u6027\u6545\u969c\uff0c\u5728\u8111\u96fe\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bcd\u5178331%\uff0c\u5728\u80f8\u75db\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u63d0\u53477%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u81ea\u4e3bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6545\u969c\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u4f4e\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u56de\u987e\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u6bd4\u4e3b\u52a8\u5e72\u9884\u66f4\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7a33\u5b9a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While computational research has focused on analyzing the intrinsic properties of memes, the dynamic and contextual use of memes to create humor remains an understudied area of web science. To address this gap, we introduce the Meme Reply Selection task and present MaMe-Re (Manga Meme Reply Benchmark), a benchmark of 100,000 human-annotated pairs (500,000 total annotations from 2,325 unique annotators) consisting of openly licensed Japanese manga panels and social media posts. Our analysis reveals three key insights: (1) large language models (LLMs) show preliminary evidence of capturing complex social cues such as exaggeration, moving beyond surface-level semantic matching; (2) the inclusion of visual information does not improve performance, revealing a gap between understanding visual content and effectively using it for contextual humor; (3) while LLMs can match human judgments in controlled settings, they struggle to distinguish subtle differences in wit among semantically similar candidates.

We use a slow, thorough, prior exploration video of the kidney to generate a reference reconstruction.

We achieve < 4mm camera pose localization error.

We formulate the problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision problem that is solved through a multi-agent reinforcement learning task in which agents use stigmergic signals (key performance indicators at the system level) to infer and react to global states. Through a 3x3 factorial design on an IEEE 34-node topology, we evaluated three training paradigms (CTCE, CTDE, DTDE) and three algorithms (PPO, APPO, SAC). Results identify APPO-DTDE as the optimal configuration, achieving a coordination score of 91.7% relative to the theoretical centralized benchmark (CTCE). However, a critical trade-off emerges between efficiency and stability: while the centralized benchmark maximizes allocative efficiency with a peer-to-peer trade ratio of 0.6, the fully decentralized approach (DTDE) demonstrates superior physical stability. Specifically, DTDE reduces the variance of grid balance by 31% compared to hybrid architectures, establishing a highly predictable, import-biased load profile that simplifies grid regulation. Furthermore, topological analysis reveals emergent spatial clustering, where decentralized agents self-organize into stable trading communities to minimize congestion penalties. While SAC excelled in hybrid settings, it failed in decentralized environments due to entropy-driven instability. This research proves that stigmergic signaling provides sufficient context for complex grid coordination, offering a robust, privacy-preserving alternative to expensive centralized communication infrastructure.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u672c\u5730\u80fd\u6e90\u5e02\u573a\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u5408\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u901a\u4fe1\u5373\u53ef\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u4f18\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5229\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u63a8\u65ad\u5168\u5c40\u72b6\u6001", "motivation": "\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u80fd\u6e90\u5e02\u573a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3001\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u901a\u4fe1\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd", "method": "\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u4f7f\u7528PPO\u3001APPO\u3001SAC\u7b97\u6cd5\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u7ee9\u6548\u6307\u6807\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4fe1\u606f\u7d20\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u8ba9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u65ad\u5168\u5c40\u72b6\u6001", "result": "APPO-DTDE\u914d\u7f6e\u8fbe\u5230\u7406\u8bba\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u57fa\u51c6\uff08CTCE\uff09\u768491.7%\u534f\u8c03\u5206\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08DTDE\uff09\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u7535\u7f51\u5e73\u8861\u65b9\u5dee31%\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u7535\u7f51\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0SAC\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u56e0\u71b5\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u800c\u5931\u8d25", "conclusion": "\u4fe1\u606f\u7d20\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u7535\u7f51\u534f\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8db3\u591f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u53c8\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u91cd\u8981\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u5f3a\u5206\u914d\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u5219\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7269\u7406\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027"}}

We consider the general setting with an alphabet of size $q$ and a resolution parameter $k$, moving beyond the binary ($q=2$) case primarily studied previously. We investigate error-correcting codes for substitution errors and deletion errors under several channel models, including $(e_1,\\ldots,e_k)$-composite error/deletion, $e$-composite error/deletion, and the newly introduced $t$-$(e_1,\\ldots,e_t)$-composite error/deletion model.\n  We first establish equivalence relations among families of composite-error correcting codes (CECCs) and among families of composite-deletion correcting codes (CDCCs). This significantly reduces the number of distinct error-parameter sets that require separate analysis. We then derive novel and general upper bounds on the sizes of CECCs using refined sphere-packing arguments and probabilistic methods. These bounds together cover all values of parameters $q$, $k$, $(e_1,\\ldots,e_k)$ and $e$. In contrast, previous bounds were only established for $q=2$ and limited choices of $k$, $(e_1,\\ldots,e_k)$ and $e$. For CDCCs, we generalize a known non-asymptotic upper bound for $(1,0,\\ldots,0)$-CDCCs and then provide a cleaner asymptotic bound.\n  On the constructive side, for any $q\\ge2$, we propose $(1,0,\\ldots,0)$-CDCCs, $1$-CDCCs and $t$-$(1,\\ldots,1)$-CDCCs with near-optimal redundancies.

For substitution errors, we design the first explicit encoding and decoding algorithms for the binary $(1,0,\\ldots,0)$-CECC constructed by Dollma \\emph{et al}, and extend the approach to general $q$.

LiDAR super-resolution addresses this challenge by using deep learning to enhance sparse point clouds, bridging the gap between different sensor types and enabling cross-sensor compatibility in real-world deployments. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of LiDAR super-resolution methods for autonomous driving. Despite the importance of practical deployment, no systematic review has been conducted until now. We organize existing approaches into four categories: CNN-based architectures, model-based deep unrolling, implicit representation methods, and Transformer and Mamba-based approaches. We establish fundamental concepts including data representations, problem formulation, benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics. Current trends include the adoption of range image representation for efficient processing, extreme model compression and the development of resolution-flexible architectures. Recent research prioritizes real-time inference and cross-sensor generalization for practical deployment.

A Benchmark of Uncertainty Metrics for LLM-Based Automatic Assessment", "comment": null, "summary": "The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) is reshaping the landscape of automatic assessment in education. While these systems demonstrate substantial advantages in adaptability to diverse question types and flexibility in output formats, they also introduce new challenges related to output uncertainty, stemming from the inherently probabilistic nature of LLMs. Output uncertainty is an inescapable challenge in automatic assessment, as assessment results often play a critical role in informing subsequent pedagogical actions, such as providing feedback to students or guiding instructional decisions. Unreliable or poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates can lead to unstable downstream interventions, potentially disrupting students' learning processes and resulting in unintended negative consequences. To systematically understand this challenge and inform future research, we benchmark a broad range of uncertainty quantification methods in the context of LLM-based automatic assessment. Although the effectiveness of these methods has been demonstrated in many tasks across other domains, their applicability and reliability in educational settings, particularly for automatic grading, remain underexplored. Through comprehensive analyses of uncertainty behaviors across multiple assessment datasets, LLM families, and generation control settings, we characterize the uncertainty patterns exhibited by LLMs in grading scenarios. Based on these findings, we evaluate the strengths and limitations of different uncertainty metrics and analyze the influence of key factors, including model families, assessment tasks, and decoding strategies, on uncertainty estimates. Our study provides actionable insights into the characteristics of uncertainty in LLM-based automatic assessment and lays the groundwork for developing more reliable and effective uncertainty-aware grading systems in the future.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In practice, failures often arise as gradual divergence of internal reasoning dynamics rather than as isolated prediction errors. This work studies runtime stability in hybrid reasoning systems from a Kalman-inspired perspective. We model reasoning as a stochastic inference process driven by an internal innovation signal and introduce cognitive drift as a measurable runtime phenomenon. Stability is defined in terms of detectability, bounded divergence, and recoverability rather than task-level correctness. We propose a runtime stability framework that monitors innovation statistics, detects emerging instability, and triggers recovery-aware control mechanisms. Experiments on multi-step, tool-augmented reasoning tasks demonstrate reliable instability detection prior to task failure and show that recovery, when feasible, re-establishes bounded internal behavior within finite time.

However, the cascaded AmBC channel suffers from severe double path loss and multiplicative fading, while accurate channel state information (CSI) acquisition is highly challenging due to the weak backscattered signal and the resource-limited nature of BDs. To address these challenges, this paper considers an AmBC system in which the reader is equipped with a pixel-based fluid antenna system (FAS). By dynamically selecting one antenna position from a dense set of pixels within a compact aperture, the FAS-enabled reader exploits spatial diversity through measurement-driven port selection, without requiring explicit CSI acquisition or multiple RF chains. The intrinsic rate-energy tradeoff at the BD is also incorporated by jointly optimizing the backscatter modulation coefficient under an energy harvesting (EH) neutrality constraint. To efficiently solve this problem, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based framework is developed to jointly determine the FAS port selection and modulation coefficient on an optimize-then-average (OTA) basis.

By modeling the wireless channel as a spatially correlated Gaussian random field, channel estimation is formulated as a Gaussian process (GP) regression problem with motion-constrained spatial sampling. Closed-form expressions for the linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) estimator and the corresponding estimation error are derived. A fundamental comparison with discrete port-based architectures is established under identical position constraints, showing that continuous FA sampling achieves equal or lower estimation error for any finite pilot budget, with strict improvement for non-degenerate spatial correlation models. Numerical results validate the analysis and show the performance gains of continuous FA sampling over discrete baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u6d41\u4f53\u5929\u7ebf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u65e0\u8702\u7a9d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e0a\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u9053\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u9ad8\u65af\u968f\u673a\u573a\uff0c\u5c06\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u5e26\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ea6\u675f\u7a7a\u95f4\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86LMMSE\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u53ca\u5176\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u3002\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u4e0e\u79bb\u6563\u7aef\u53e3\u67b6\u6784\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u8fde\u7eed\u6d41\u4f53\u5929\u7ebf\u91c7\u6837\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u6709\u9650\u5bfc\u9891\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5747\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u76f8\u7b49\u6216\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5bf9\u975e\u9000\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6a21\u578b\u6709\u4e25\u683c\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u63a2\u7d22\u8fde\u7eed\u6d41\u4f53\u5929\u7ebf\u91c7\u6837\u5728\u65e0\u8702\u7a9d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u8fde\u7eed\u6d41\u4f53\u5929\u7ebf\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u79bb\u6563\u7aef\u53e3\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u9053\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u65e0\u7ebf\u4fe1\u9053\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u9ad8\u65af\u968f\u673a\u573a\u3002\u5c06\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u5e26\u8fd0\u52a8\u7ea6\u675f\u7a7a\u95f4\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u3002\u63a8\u5bfc\u7ebf\u6027\u6700\u5c0f\u5747\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u91cf\u53ca\u5176\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u76f8\u540c\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fde\u7eed\u6d41\u4f53\u5929\u7ebf\u91c7\u6837\u76f8\u6bd4\u79bb\u6563\u7aef\u53e3\u67b6\u6784\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u7b49\u6216\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u3002\u5bf9\u975e\u9000\u5316\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8fde\u7eed\u91c7\u6837\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8fde\u7eed\u6d41\u4f53\u5929\u7ebf\u91c7\u6837\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fde\u7eed\u6d41\u4f53\u5929\u7ebf\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u65e0\u8702\u7a9d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e0a\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6709\u9650\u5bfc\u9891\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u9053\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u79bb\u6563\u7aef\u53e3\u67b6\u6784\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, spatial reasoning on Earth imagery has lagged behind, as it uniquely involves grounding objects in georeferenced images and quantitatively reasoning about distances, directions, and topological relations using both visual cues and vector geometry coordinates (e.g., 2D bounding boxes, polylines, and polygons). Existing benchmarks for Earth imagery primarily focus on 2D spatial grounding, image captioning, and coarse spatial relations (e.g., simple directional or proximity cues). They lack support for quantitative direction and distance reasoning, systematic topological relations, and complex object geometries beyond bounding boxes. To fill this gap, we propose \\textbf{EarthSpatialBench}, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating spatial reasoning in MLLMs on Earth imagery. The benchmark contains over 325K question-answer pairs spanning: (1) qualitative and quantitative reasoning about spatial distance and direction; (2) systematic topological relations; (3) single-object queries, object-pair queries, and compositional aggregate group queries; and (4) object references expressed via textual descriptions, visual overlays, and explicit geometry coordinates, including 2D bounding boxes, polylines, and polygons. We conducted extensive experiments on both open-source and proprietary models to identify limitations in the spatial reasoning of MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86EarthSpatialBench\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5730\u7403\u5f71\u50cf\u4e0a\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8d85\u8fc732.5\u4e07\u4e2a\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u65b9\u5411\u3001\u62d3\u6251\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u7b49\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5730\u7403\u5f71\u50cf\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u57282D\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u7c97\u7565\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0a\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5b9a\u91cf\u65b9\u5411\u8ddd\u79bb\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u62d3\u6251\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u590d\u6742\u51e0\u4f55\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u5177\u8eabAI\u7b49\u9700\u8981\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u7cbe\u786e\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86EarthSpatialBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5b9a\u6027/\u5b9a\u91cf\u8ddd\u79bb\u65b9\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u62d3\u6251\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u5355\u5bf9\u8c61/\u5bf9\u8c61\u5bf9/\u7ec4\u5408\u805a\u5408\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u53e0\u52a0\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u51e0\u4f55\u5750\u6807\uff08\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u3001\u6298\u7ebf\u3001\u591a\u8fb9\u5f62\uff09\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u53c2\u8003\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5f00\u6e90\u548c\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8be5\u57fa\u51c6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86MLLMs\u5728\u5730\u7403\u5f71\u50cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "EarthSpatialBench\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u5730\u7403\u5f71\u50cf\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347MLLMs\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

In contrast, the current large language model training paradigm relies heavily on modeling vast, static corpora. While effective for knowledge acquisition, it overlooks the interactive feedback loops essential for models to adapt dynamically to their context. In this work, we propose a framework that treats this interactive in-context learning ability not as an emergent property, but as a distinct, trainable skill. We introduce a scalable method that transforms single-turn verifiable tasks into multi-turn didactic interactions driven by information asymmetry. We first show that current flagship models struggle to integrate corrective feedback on hard reasoning tasks. We then demonstrate that models trained with our approach dramatically improve the ability to interactively learn from language feedback. More specifically, the multi-turn performance of a smaller model nearly reaches that of a model an order of magnitude larger. We also observe robust out-of-distribution generalization: interactive training on math problems transfers to diverse domains like coding, puzzles and maze navigation. Our qualitative analysis suggests that this improvement is due to an enhanced in-context plasticity. Finally, we show that this paradigm offers a unified path to self-improvement. By training the model to predict the teacher's critiques, effectively modeling the feedback environment, we convert this external signal into an internal capability, allowing the model to self-correct even without a teacher.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, its benefits are not unidirectionally beneficial. There is no theoretical research or established estimation for the optimal sample size (OSS) in augmentation, nor is there an established metric to evaluate the accuracy of OSS or its deviation from the ground truth. To address these issues, we propose an information-theoretic optimal sample size estimation (IT-OSE) to provide reliable OSS estimation for industrial data augmentation. An interval coverage and deviation (ICD) score is proposed to evaluate the estimated OSS intuitively. The relationship between OSS and dominant factors is theoretically analyzed and formulated, thereby enhancing the interpretability. Experiments show that, compared to empirical estimation, the IT-OSE increases accuracy in classification tasks across baseline models by an average of 4.38%, and reduces MAPE in regression tasks across baseline models by an average of 18.80%. The improvements in downstream model performance are more stable. ICDdev in the ICD score is also reduced by an average of 49.30%. The determinism of OSS is enhanced. Compared to exhaustive search, the IT-OSE achieves the same OSS while reducing computational and data costs by an average of 83.97% and 93.46%.

In this paper, we show that for a broad class\n  of jointly distributed random variables $(X,Y)$ the Ingleton inequality holds up to a small additive error, even even though the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ is far from being extractable. Contrary to common intuition, strongly non-extractable mutual information does not lead to large violations of the Ingleton inequality in this setting. More precisely, we consider pairs $(X,Y)$ that are uniformly distributed on their joint support and whose associated biregular bipartite graph is an expander. For all auxiliary random variables $A$ and $B$ jointly distributed with $(X,Y)$, we establish a lower bound on the Ingleton quantity $I(X:Y | A) + I(X:Y | B) + I(A:B) - I(X:Y)$ in terms of the spectral parameters of the underlying graph.

Despite that, LLMs' ability to reason about GPS coordinates and real-world geography remains underexplored. We introduce GPSBench, a dataset of 57,800 samples across 17 tasks for evaluating geospatial reasoning in LLMs, spanning geometric coordinate operations (e.g., distance and bearing computation) and reasoning that integrates coordinates with world knowledge. Focusing on intrinsic model capabilities rather than tool use, we evaluate 14 state-of-the-art LLMs and find that GPS reasoning remains challenging, with substantial variation across tasks: models are generally more reliable at real-world geographic reasoning than at geometric computations. Geographic knowledge degrades hierarchically, with strong country-level performance but weak city-level localization, while robustness to coordinate noise suggests genuine coordinate understanding rather than memorization. We further show that GPS-coordinate augmentation can improve in downstream geospatial tasks, and that finetuning induces trade-offs between gains in geometric computation and degradation in world knowledge.

Despite notable progress, most existing methods represent student learning solely as exercise sequences, overlooking rich behavioral interaction information. This limited representation often leads to biased and unreliable estimates of learning progress. Moreover, fixed-length sequence segmentation limits the incorporation of early learning experiences, thereby hindering the modeling of long-term dependencies and the accurate estimation of knowledge mastery. To address these limitations, we propose BamaER, a Behavior-aware memory-augmented Exercise Recommendation framework that comprises three core modules: (i) the learning progress prediction module that captures heterogeneous student interaction behaviors via a tri-directional hybrid encoding scheme; (ii) the memory-augmented knowledge tracing module that maintains a dynamic memory matrix to jointly model historical and current knowledge states for robust mastery estimation; and (iii) the exercise filtering module that formulates candidate selection as a diversity-aware optimization problem, solved via the Hippopotamus Optimization Algorithm to reduce redundancy and improve recommendation coverage.

We study the problem of SPIR on graph-replicated database systems, where each node of the graph represents a server and each link represents a message. Each message is replicated at exactly two servers; those at which the link representing the message is incident. To ensure database privacy, the servers share a set of common randomness, independent of the database and the user's desired message index. We study two cases of common randomness distribution to the servers: i) graph-replicated common randomness, and ii) fully-replicated common randomness. Given a graph-replicated database system, in i), we assign one randomness variable independently to every pair of servers sharing a message, while in ii), we assign an identical set of randomness variable to all servers, irrespective of the underlying graph. In both settings, our goal is to characterize the SPIR capacity, i.e., the maximum number of desired message symbols retrieved per downloaded symbol, and quantify the minimum amount of common randomness required to achieve the capacity. To this goal, in setting i), we derive a general lower bound on the SPIR capacity, and show it to be tight for path and regular graphs through a matching converse. Moreover, we establish that the minimum size of common randomness required for SPIR is equal to the message size. In setting ii), the SPIR capacity improves over the first, more restrictive setting. We show this through capacity lower bounds for a class of graphs, by constructing SPIR schemes from PIR schemes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Prior approaches typically rely on static datasets, either training implicit preference models on interaction history or encoding user profiles in external memory. However, these approaches struggle with new users and with preferences that change over time. We introduce Personalized Agents from Human Feedback (PAHF), a framework for continual personalization in which agents learn online from live interaction using explicit per-user memory. PAHF operationalizes a three-step loop: (1) seeking pre-action clarification to resolve ambiguity, (2) grounding actions in preferences retrieved from memory, and (3) integrating post-action feedback to update memory when preferences drift. To evaluate this capability, we develop a four-phase protocol and two benchmarks in embodied manipulation and online shopping. These benchmarks quantify an agent's ability to learn initial preferences from scratch and subsequently adapt to persona shifts. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results show that integrating explicit memory with dual feedback channels is critical: PAHF learns substantially faster and consistently outperforms both no-memory and single-channel baselines, reducing initial personalization error and enabling rapid adaptation to preference shifts.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, scaling such models to large spatiotemporal domains is hindered by computational bottlenecks and optimization instabilities. In this work, we propose a robust distributed PINNs framework designed for efficient flow reconstruction via spatiotemporal domain decomposition. A critical challenge in such distributed solvers is pressure indeterminacy, where independent sub-networks drift into inconsistent local pressure baselines. We address this issue through a reference anchor normalization strategy coupled with decoupled asymmetric weighting. By enforcing a unidirectional information flow from designated master ranks where the anchor point lies to neighboring ranks, our approach eliminates gauge freedom and guarantees global pressure uniqueness while preserving temporal continuity. Furthermore, to mitigate the Python interpreter overhead associated with computing high-order physics residuals, we implement a high-performance training pipeline accelerated by CUDA graphs and JIT compilation. Extensive validation on complex flow benchmarks demonstrates that our method achieves near-linear strong scaling and high-fidelity reconstruction, establishing a scalable and physically rigorous pathway for flow reconstruction and understanding of complex hydrodynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The control scheme is divided into two steps. The first one is dedicated to the estimation of the leader state by each follower in a distributed way and in a fixed-time. Then, based on the estimate of the leader state, each follower computes its control law to track the leader in a fixed-time. In this paper, two control strategies are investigated and compared to solve the two mentioned steps. The first one is an autonomous protocol which ensures a fixed-time convergence for the observer and for the controller parts where the Upper Bound of the Settling-Time (UBST) is set a priory by the user. Then, the previous strategy is redesigned using time-varying gains to obtain a non-autonomous protocol. This enables to obtain less conservative estimates of the UBST while guaranteeing that the time-varying gains remain bounded.

In the text-symbol condition, Claude and ChatGPT achieve approximately 91% cell accuracy and 84% F1, while Gemini achieves 84% accuracy and 63% F1. In the filled-squares condition, all three models collapse to 60-73% accuracy and 29-39% F1. Critically, all conditions pass through the same visual encoder -- the text symbols are images, not tokenized text. The text-vs-squares F1 gap ranges from 34 to 54 points across models, demonstrating that VLMs behave as if they possess a high-fidelity text-recognition pathway for spatial reasoning that dramatically outperforms their native visual pathway.

The question we investigate is whether it is possible to derive vanishing regret bounds that hold with high probability, complementing existing bounds from the literature that hold in expectation. We propose such high-probability bounds which have a very similar form as the prior expectation bounds. For the case of universal prediction of a stochastic process over a countable alphabet, our bound states a convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/2} \u03b4^{-1/2})$ with probability as least $1-\u03b4$ compared to prior known in-expectation bounds of the order $\\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/2})$. We also propose an impossibility result which proves that it is not possible to improve the exponent of $\u03b4$ in a bound of the same form without making additional assumptions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing registration methods, constrained by brightness constancy assumptions, achieve limited alignment quality, while recent generative approaches address domain shift through complex architectures that lack temporal awareness across frames. We propose GPEReg-Net, a scene-appearance disentanglement framework that separates domain-invariant scene features from domain-specific appearance codes via Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN), enabling direct image-to-image registration without explicit deformation field estimation. To exploit temporal structure in sequential acquisitions, we introduce a Global Position Encoding (GPE) module that combines learnable position embeddings with sinusoidal encoding and cross-frame attention, allowing the network to leverage context from neighboring frames for improved temporal coherence. On the OR-PAM-Reg-4K benchmark (432 test samples), GPEReg-Net achieves NCC of 0.953, SSIM of 0.932, and PSNR of 34.49dB, surpassing the state-of-the-art by 3.8% in SSIM and 1.99dB in PSNR while maintaining competitive NCC.

Rather than proposing novel methods, we focus on several alternative approaches whose potential benefits are widely imaginable, yet have remained largely unexplored. The currently dominant paradigm, which can be termed \"extract then store,\" involves extracting information judged to be useful from experiences and saving only the extracted content. However, this approach inherently risks the loss of information, as some valuable knowledge particularly for different tasks may be discarded in the extraction process. In contrast, we emphasize the \"store then on-demand extract\" approach, which seeks to retain raw experiences and flexibly apply them to various tasks as needed, thus avoiding such information loss. In addition, we highlight two further approaches: discovering deeper insights from large collections of probabilistic experiences, and improving experience collection efficiency by sharing stored experiences. While these approaches seem intuitively effective, our simple experiments demonstrate that this is indeed the case. Finally, we discuss major challenges that have limited investigation into these promising directions and propose research topics to address them.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While recent deep learning models have achieved strong average accuracy, the increasing frequency and intensity of climate-driven extreme weather events pose severe threats to grid stability and operational security. Consequently, developing robust forecasting models that can withstand volatile conditions has become a paramount challenge. In this paper, we present R$^2$Energy, a large-scale benchmark for NWP-assisted renewable energy forecasting. It comprises over 10.7 million high-fidelity hourly records from 902 wind and solar stations across four provinces in China, providing the diverse meteorological conditions necessary to capture the wide-ranging variability of renewable generation. We further establish a standardized, leakage-free forecasting paradigm that grants all models identical access to future Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) signals, enabling fair and reproducible comparison across state-of-the-art representative forecasting architectures. Beyond aggregate accuracy, we incorporate regime-wise evaluation with expert-aligned extreme weather annotations, uncovering a critical ``robustness gap'' typically obscured by average metrics. This gap reveals a stark robustness-complexity trade-off: under extreme conditions, a model's reliability is driven by its meteorological integration strategy rather than its architectural complexity.

The proposed method is structured using a two-stage approach. In the first stage, the additional active power loading capacity of the network and each individual bus is determined using an iterative approach. This analysis quantifies the network's additional active loadability limits and identifies buses with high active power loading capacity, which are considered candidate nodes for the placement of DG units. Subsequently, in the second stage, the optimal locations and sizes of DG units are determined using the Monte Carlo method, with the objectives of minimizing voltage deviation and reducing active power losses in the network. The methodology is validated on the standard IEEE 33-bus RDN to determine the optimal locations and sizes of DG units. The results demonstrate that the optimal allocation of one, two, and three DG units, achieved from proposed method, reduces network active power losses by 50.37%, 58.62%, and 65.16%, respectively, and also significantly enhances the voltage profile across all buses.

To boost both effectiveness and transferability in this setting, we propose a new detect-segment-identify pipeline that leverages the Open-Vocabulary Weight-free Localisation and the Segment Anything models as pre-processing stages alongside Re-ID networks. To evaluate our approach, we publish a collection of nine days CCTV data filmed on a working dairy farm.

This significantly outperforms current oriented bounding box-driven, as well as SAM species detection baselines with accuracy improvements of 47.52% and 27.13%, respectively. We show that unsupervised contrastive learning can build on this to yield 94.82% Re-ID accuracy on our test data.

However, their iterative sampling nature results in high inference latency. While recent distillation techniques accelerate sampling, they discard intermediate trajectory steps. This sparse supervision leads to a loss of structural information and introduces significant discretization errors. To mitigate this, we propose B-DENSE, a novel framework that leverages multi-branch trajectory alignment. We modify the student architecture to output $K$-fold expanded channels, where each subset corresponds to a specific branch representing a discrete intermediate step in the teacher's trajectory. By training these branches to simultaneously map to the entire sequence of the teacher's target timesteps, we enforce dense intermediate trajectory alignment. Consequently, the student model learns to navigate the solution space from the earliest stages of training, demonstrating superior image generation quality compared to baseline distillation frameworks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6269\u6563\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u4e22\u5f03\u4e2d\u95f4\u8f68\u8ff9\u6b65\u9aa4\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faB-DENSE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5206\u652f\u8f68\u8ff9\u5bf9\u9f50\u6539\u8fdb\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u52a0\u901f\u91c7\u6837\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fed\u4ee3\u91c7\u6837\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u8fd1\u671f\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u6280\u672f\u901a\u8fc7\u4e22\u5f03\u4e2d\u95f4\u8f68\u8ff9\u6b65\u9aa4\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u7a00\u758f\u76d1\u7763\u4f1a\u9020\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u548c\u663e\u8457\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faB-DENSE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u4fee\u6539\u4e3a\u8f93\u51faK\u500d\u6269\u5c55\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u901a\u9053\u5b50\u96c6\u5bf9\u5e94\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u79bb\u6563\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u652f\u540c\u65f6\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6559\u5e08\u76ee\u6807\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u6574\u4e2a\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e2d\u95f4\u8f68\u8ff9\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "B-DENSE\u6846\u67b6\u8ba9\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6700\u65e9\u9636\u6bb5\u5c31\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5206\u652f\u8f68\u8ff9\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684B-DENSE\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6269\u6563\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u548c\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u52a0\u901f\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, contact-based sensors such as pulse oximeters may cause skin irritation, increase infection risk, and lead to patient discomfort. Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) offers a contactless alternative to monitor heart rate using facial video, but remains underutilized in PICUs due to motion artifacts, occlusions, variable lighting, and domain shifts between laboratory and clinical data.\n  We introduce a self-supervised pretraining framework for rPPG estimation in the PICU setting, based on a progressive curriculum strategy. The approach leverages the VisionMamba architecture and integrates an adaptive masking mechanism, where a lightweight Mamba-based controller assigns spatiotemporal importance scores to guide probabilistic patch sampling. This strategy dynamically increases reconstruction difficulty while preserving physiological relevance.\n  To address the lack of labeled clinical data, we adopt a teacher-student distillation setup. A supervised expert model, trained on public datasets, provides latent physiological guidance to the student. The curriculum progresses through three stages: clean public videos, synthetic occlusion scenarios, and unlabeled videos from 500 pediatric patients.\n  Our framework achieves a 42% reduction in mean absolute error relative to standard masked autoencoders and outperforms PhysFormer by 31%, reaching a final MAE of 3.2 bpm. Without explicit region-of-interest extraction, the model consistently attends to pulse-rich areas and demonstrates robustness under clinical occlusions and noise.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recent work showed that mutual cooperation can be induced between \"learning-aware\" agents that account for and shape the learning dynamics of their co-players. However, existing approaches typically rely on hardcoded, often inconsistent, assumptions about co-player learning rules or enforce a strict separation between \"naive learners\" updating on fast timescales and \"meta-learners\" observing these updates. Here, we demonstrate that the in-context learning capabilities of sequence models allow for co-player learning awareness without requiring hardcoded assumptions or explicit timescale separation. We show that training sequence model agents against a diverse distribution of co-players naturally induces in-context best-response strategies, effectively functioning as learning algorithms on the fast intra-episode timescale. We find that the cooperative mechanism identified in prior work-where vulnerability to extortion drives mutual shaping-emerges naturally in this setting: in-context adaptation renders agents vulnerable to extortion, and the resulting mutual pressure to shape the opponent's in-context learning dynamics resolves into the learning of cooperative behavior. Our results suggest that standard decentralized reinforcement learning on sequence models combined with co-player diversity provides a scalable path to learning cooperative behaviors.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u60c5\u5883\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u5b9e\u73b0\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u786c\u7f16\u7801\u5047\u8bbe\u6216\u663e\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u5229\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u786c\u7f16\u7801\u5bf9\u624b\u5b66\u4e60\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u6216\u5f3a\u5236\u5feb\u6162\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u79bb\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u6297\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5bf9\u624b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u8bf1\u5bfc\u51fa\u60c5\u5883\u6700\u4f18\u54cd\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u5feb\u901f\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fd0\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5148\u524d\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e2d\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5bf9\u52d2\u7d22\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u76f8\u4e92\u5851\u9020\uff09\u5728\u6b64\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u81ea\u7136\u51fa\u73b0\uff1a\u60c5\u5883\u9002\u5e94\u4f7f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u52d2\u7d22\u53d8\u5f97\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u800c\u7531\u6b64\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u538b\u529b\u5851\u9020\u5bf9\u624b\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5b9e\u73b0\u5408\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6807\u51c6\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u5408\u5bf9\u624b\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b66\u4e60\u5408\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u5883\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u4f7f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u8bbe\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u81ea\u7136\u53d1\u5c55\u51fa\u76f8\u4e92\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Despite the meteoric rise in the number of neuromorphic datasets published over the past ten years, the conclusion of a significant portion of neuromorphic research papers still states that there is a need for yet more data and even larger datasets. Whilst this need is driven in part by the sheer volume of data required by modern deep learning approaches, it is also fuelled by the current state of the available neuromorphic datasets and the difficulties in finding them, understanding their purpose, and determining the nature of their underlying task. This is further compounded by practical difficulties in downloading and using these datasets. This review starts by capturing a snapshot of the existing neuromorphic datasets, covering over 423 datasets, and then explores the nature of their tasks and the underlying structure of the presented data. Analysing these datasets shows the difficulties arising from their size, the lack of standardisation, and difficulties in accessing the actual data. This paper also highlights the growth in the size of individual datasets and the complexities involved in working with the data. However, a more important concern is the rise of synthetic datasets, created by either simulation or video-to-events methods. This review explores the benefits of simulated data for testing existing algorithms and applications, highlighting the potential pitfalls for exploring new applications of neuromorphic technologies. This review also introduces the concepts of meta-datasets, created from existing datasets, as a way of both reducing the need for more data, and to remove potential bias arising from defining both the dataset and the task.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Natural language is interpretable but vulnerable to semantic drift, while learned protocols are efficient but opaque. We propose a certification protocol based on the stimulus-meaning model, where agents are tested on shared observable events and terms are certified if empirical disagreement falls below a statistical threshold. In this protocol, agents restricting their reasoning to certified terms (\"core-guarded reasoning\") achieve provably bounded disagreement.

We introduce CAFE, a framework that reformulates AFE as a causally-guided sequential decision process, bridging causal discovery with reinforcement learning-driven feature construction. Phase I learns a sparse directed acyclic graph over features and the target to obtain soft causal priors, grouping features as direct, indirect, or other based on their causal influence with respect to the target. Phase II uses a cascading multi-agent deep Q-learning architecture to select causal groups and transformation operators, with hierarchical reward shaping and causal group-level exploration strategies that favor causally plausible transformations while controlling feature complexity. Across 15 public benchmarks (classification with macro-F1; regression with inverse relative absolute error), CAFE achieves up to 7% improvement over strong AFE baselines, reduces episodes-to-convergence, and delivers competitive time-to-target. Under controlled covariate shifts, CAFE reduces performance drop by ~4x relative to a non-causal multi-agent baseline, and produces more compact feature sets with more stable post-hoc attributions. These findings underscore that causal structure, used as a soft inductive prior rather than a rigid constraint, can substantially improve the robustness and efficiency of automated feature engineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Additionally, these schemes are often under-optimized in terms of hyperparameters, prompts, runtime, and prompting cost. To address these limitations, we introduce Framework of Thoughts (FoT)--a general-purpose foundation framework for building and optimizing dynamic reasoning schemes. FoT comes with built-in features for hyperparameter tuning, prompt optimization, parallel execution, and intelligent caching, unlocking the latent performance potential of reasoning schemes.

Existing quantizers face a trade-off: vector-quantized tokenizers learn flexible geometries but often suffer from biased straight-through optimization, codebook under-utilization, and representation collapse at large vocabularies. Structured scalar or implicit tokenizers ensure stable, near-complete utilization by design, yet rely on fixed discretization geometries that may allocate capacity inefficiently under heterogeneous latent statistics.\n  We introduce Learnable Geometric Quantization (LGQ), a discrete image tokenizer that learns discretization geometry end-to-end. LGQ replaces hard nearest-neighbor lookup with temperature-controlled soft assignments, enabling fully differentiable training while recovering hard assignments at inference. The assignments correspond to posterior responsibilities of an isotropic Gaussian mixture and minimize a variational free-energy objective, provably converging to nearest-neighbor quantization in the low-temperature limit. LGQ combines a token-level peakedness regularizer with a global usage regularizer to encourage confident yet balanced code utilization without imposing rigid grids.\n  Under a controlled VQGAN-style backbone on ImageNet across multiple vocabulary sizes, LGQ achieves stable optimization and balanced utilization. At 16K codebook size, LGQ improves rFID by 11.88% over FSQ while using 49.96% fewer active codes, and improves rFID by 6.06% over SimVQ with 49.45% lower effective representation rate, achieving comparable fidelity with substantially fewer active entries.

Clinical interpretation relies on both slice-driven local features (e.g., sub-centimeter nodules, lesion boundaries) and volume-driven spatial representations (e.g., tumor infiltration, inter-organ anatomical relations). However, existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain fragmented in CT slice versus volumetric understanding: slice-driven LVLMs show strong generalization but lack cross-slice spatial consistency, while volume-driven LVLMs explicitly capture volumetric semantics but suffer from coarse granularity and poor compatibility with slice inputs. The absence of a unified modeling paradigm constitutes a major bottleneck for the clinical translation of medical LVLMs. We present OmniCT, a powerful unified slice-volume LVLM for CT scenarios, which makes three contributions: (i) Spatial Consistency Enhancement (SCE): volumetric slice composition combined with tri-axial positional embedding that introduces volumetric consistency, and an MoE hybrid projection enables efficient slice-volume adaptation; (ii) Organ-level Semantic Enhancement (OSE): segmentation and ROI localization explicitly align anatomical regions, emphasizing lesion- and organ-level semantics; (iii) MedEval-CT: the largest slice-volume CT dataset and hybrid benchmark integrates comprehensive metrics for unified evaluation. OmniCT consistently outperforms existing methods with a substantial margin across diverse clinical tasks and satisfies both micro-level detail sensitivity and macro-level spatial reasoning.

Based on these observations, an investigation is conducted to determine whether the Agent Skill paradigm provides similar benefits to small language models (SLMs). This question matters in industrial scenarios where continuous reliance on public APIs is infeasible due to data-security and budget constraints requirements, and where SLMs often show limited generalization in highly customized scenarios. This work introduces a formal mathematical definition of the Agent Skill process, followed by a systematic evaluation of language models of varying sizes across multiple use cases. The evaluation encompasses two open-source tasks and a real-world insurance claims data set. The results show that tiny models struggle with reliable skill selection, while moderately sized SLMs (approximately 12B - 30B) parameters) benefit substantially from the Agent Skill approach. Moreover, code-specialized variants at around 80B parameters achieve performance comparable to closed-source baselines while improving GPU efficiency. Collectively, these findings provide a comprehensive and nuanced characterization of the capabilities and constraints of the framework, while providing actionable insights for the effective deployment of Agent Skills in SLM-centered environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Prior methods reduce speculation depth when MoE verification becomes expensive. We propose MoE-Spec, a training-free verification-time expert budgeting method that decouples speculation depth from memory cost by enforcing a fixed expert capacity limit at each layer, loading only the experts that contribute most to verification and dropping the long tail of rarely used experts that drive bandwidth overhead.

While rising accuracy scores on standard benchmarks suggest rapid progress, many agents still continue to fail in practice. This discrepancy highlights a fundamental limitation of current evaluations: compressing agent behavior into a single success metric obscures critical operational flaws. Notably, it ignores whether agents behave consistently across runs, withstand perturbations, fail predictably, or have bounded error severity. Grounded in safety-critical engineering, we provide a holistic performance profile by proposing twelve concrete metrics that decompose agent reliability along four key dimensions: consistency, robustness, predictability, and safety. Evaluating 14 agentic models across two complementary benchmarks, we find that recent capability gains have only yielded small improvements in reliability. By exposing these persistent limitations, our metrics complement traditional evaluations while offering tools for reasoning about how agents perform, degrade, and fail.", "AI": {"tldr": "AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u5355\u4e00\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6307\u6807\u63a9\u76d6\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u53cd\u6620\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5982\u884c\u4e3a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u7b49\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u9700\u6c42\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5de5\u7a0b\u7406\u5ff5\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5305\u542b4\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff09\u768412\u4e2a\u5177\u4f53\u6307\u6807\u6765\u5206\u89e3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff1b\u57282\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8614\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u6539\u5584\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u65b0\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u4f53\u7cfb\u80fd\u591f\u8865\u5145\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3001\u9000\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u5931\u8d25\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

We train reward models for six criteria -- empathy, safety, active listening, self-motivated change, trust/rapport, and patient autonomy -- and systematically compare multi-objective approaches against single-objective optimization, supervised fine-tuning, and parameter merging. Multi-objective DPO (MODPO) achieves superior balance (77.6% empathy, 62.6% safety) compared to single-objective optimization (93.6% empathy, 47.8% safety), and therapeutic criteria outperform general communication principles by 17.2%.

Traditional approaches analyze crossings individually, limiting the ability to identify shared behavioral patterns across locations. We propose a multi-view tensor decomposition framework that captures behavioral similarities across three temporal phases: Approach (warning activation to gate lowering), Waiting (gates down to train passage), and Clearance (train passage to gate raising). We analyze railway crossing videos from multiple locations using TimeSformer embeddings to represent each phase. By constructing phase-specific similarity matrices and applying non-negative symmetric CP decomposition, we discover latent behavioral components with distinct temporal signatures. Our tensor analysis reveals that crossing location appears to be a stronger determinant of behavior patterns than time of day, and that approach-phase behavior provides particularly discriminative signatures. Visualization of the learned component space confirms location-based clustering, with certain crossings forming distinct behavioral clusters. This automated framework enables scalable pattern discovery across multiple crossings, providing a foundation for grouping locations by behavioral similarity to inform targeted safety interventions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Preprint", "summary": "Demographic bias in text-to-image (T2I) generation is well studied, yet demographic-conditioned failures in instruction-guided image-to-image (I2I) editing remain underexplored. We examine whether identical edit instructions yield systematically different outcomes across subject demographics in open-weight I2I editors. We formalize two failure modes: Soft Erasure, where edits are silently weakened or ignored in the output image, and Stereotype Replacement, where edits introduce unrequested, stereotype-consistent attributes. We introduce a controlled benchmark that probes demographic-conditioned behavior by generating and editing portraits conditioned on race, gender, and age using a diagnostic prompt set, and evaluate multiple editors with vision-language model (VLM) scoring and human evaluation. Our analysis shows that identity preservation failures are pervasive, demographically uneven, and shaped by implicit social priors, including occupation-driven gender inference. Finally, we demonstrate that a prompt-level identity constraint, without model updates, can substantially reduce demographic change for minority groups while leaving majority-group portraits largely unchanged, revealing asymmetric identity priors in current editors. Together, our findings establish identity preservation as a central and demographically uneven failure mode in I2I editing and motivate demographic-robust editing systems.

Accurate localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) relies on intracranial EEG (iEEG). Clinical workflows, however, remain constrained by labor-intensive manual review. At the same time, existing data-driven approaches are typically developed on single-center datasets that are inconsistent in format and metadata, lack standardized benchmarks, and rarely release pathological event annotations, creating barriers to reproducibility, cross-center validation, and clinical relevance. With extensive efforts to reconcile heterogeneous iEEG formats, metadata, and recordings across publicly available sources, we present $\\textbf{Omni-iEEG}$, a large-scale, pre-surgical iEEG resource comprising $\\textbf{302 patients}$ and $\\textbf{178 hours}$ of high-resolution recordings. The dataset includes harmonized clinical metadata such as seizure onset zones, resections, and surgical outcomes, all validated by board-certified epileptologists. In addition, Omni-iEEG provides over 36K expert-validated annotations of pathological events, enabling robust biomarker studies. Omni-iEEG serves as a bridge between machine learning and epilepsy research. It defines clinically meaningful tasks with unified evaluation metrics grounded in clinical priors, enabling systematic evaluation of models in clinically relevant settings. Beyond benchmarking, we demonstrate the potential of end-to-end modeling on long iEEG segments and highlight the transferability of representations pretrained on non-neurophysiological domains.

In this work, we argue that two-stream attention may be serving a more subtle role. We identify a structural-semantic tradeoff in any-order generation: the hidden representation at each step must simultaneously attend to semantically informative tokens for prediction and structurally recent tokens for summarization, objectives that compete for attention capacity in a single stream but can specialize across two streams. To isolate this tradeoff from position-content separation, we propose Decoupled RoPE, a modification to rotary position embeddings that provides target position information without revealing target content. Decoupled RoPE performs competitively at short sequence lengths--where semantic and structural proximity coincide--but degrades as sequence length increases and the two orderings diverge. These results suggest that the success of two-stream attention stems not merely from separating position from content, but from circumventing the deeper structural-semantic tradeoff inherent to any-order generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In real-world edge detection (e.g., floor-plan walls, satellite roads/buildings, and medical organ boundaries), crispness and data efficiency are crucial, yet producing crisp raw edge maps with limited training samples remains challenging. Although image-generation foundation models perform well on many downstream tasks, their pretrained priors for data-efficient transfer and iterative refinement for high-frequency detail preservation remain underexploited for edge detection. To enable crisp and data-efficient edge detection using these capabilities, we introduce an edge-specialized adaptation of image-generation foundation models. To better specialize the foundation model for edge detection, we incorporate an edge-oriented objective with an efficient pixel-space loss. At inference, we introduce guidance based on unconditional dynamics, enabling a single model to control the edge density through a guidance scale.

Predictive maintenance frameworks increasingly leverage sensor-generated time-series data, yet traditional methods require manual feature engineering, and deep learning models often degrade in online settings with evolving operational patterns. This work presents a semantic-aware, label-efficient continual learning framework for railway fault diagnostics. Accelerometer signals are encoded via a Variational AutoEncoder into latent representations capturing the normal operational structure in a fully unsupervised manner. Importantly, semantic metadata, including axle counts, wheel indexes, and strain-based deformations, is extracted via AI-driven peak detection on fiber Bragg grating sensors (resistant to electromagnetic interference) and fused with the VAE embeddings, enhancing anomaly detection under unknown operational conditions. A lightweight gradient boosting supervised classifier stabilizes anomaly scoring with minimal labels, while a replay-based continual learning strategy enables adaptation to evolving domains without catastrophic forgetting.

However, existing multimodal fusion methods face significant challenges. First, they often rely on computationally expensive models, limiting their applicability in low-resource environments. Second, they often employ cascaded attention modules, which potentially increase risk of information loss during inter-module transitions and hinder their capacity to effectively capture robust shared representations across modalities. This restricts their generalization in multi-disease analysis tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hybrid Parallel-Fusion Cascaded Attention Network (HyPCA-Net), composed of two core novel blocks: (a) a computationally efficient residual adaptive learning attention block for capturing refined modality-specific representations, and (b) a dual-view cascaded attention block aimed at learning robust shared representations across diverse modalities. Extensive experiments on ten publicly available datasets exhibit that HyPCA-Net significantly outperforms existing leading methods, with improvements of up to 5.2% in performance and reductions of up to 73.1% in computational cost.

Most existing work includes all related data sources via simultaneously training a common feature extractor and source-specific heads. It is well understood that data sources with low relevance or poor quality may hinder representation learning. In this paper, we further dive into the question of which data sources should be learned jointly by focusing on the traditionally deemed ``good'' collection of sources, in which individual sources have similar relevance and qualities with respect to the true underlying common structure. Towards tractability, we focus on the linear setting where sources share a low-dimensional subspace. We find that source screening can play a central role in statistically optimal subspace estimation. We show that, for a broad class of problem instances, training on a carefully selected subset of sources suffices to achieve minimax optimality, even when a substantial portion of data is discarded. We formalize the notion of an informative subpopulation, develop algorithms and practical heuristics for identifying such subsets, and validate their effectiveness through both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Unfortunately, the majority of these studies do not model correlations between node features, which would naturally exist in a variety of real-life networks. Consequently, the derived limitations of GNNs, resulting from such convergence behaviour, is not truly reflective of the expressive power of GNNs when applied to realistic graphs. In this paper, we will introduce a novel method to generate random graphs that have correlated node features. The node features will be sampled in such a manner to ensure correlation between neighbouring nodes. As motivation for our choice of sampling scheme, we will appeal to properties exhibited by real-life graphs, particularly properties that are captured by the Barab\u00e1si-Albert model. A theoretical analysis will strongly indicate that convergence can be avoided in some cases, which we will empirically validate on large random graphs generated using our novel method.

We evaluate our approach on six large-scale aerial campaigns conducted over two years under diverse seasonal and environmental conditions.

Most existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches model LLM agents as flat policies operating at a single time scale, selecting one action at each turn. In sparse-reward settings, such flat policies must propagate credit across the entire trajectory without explicit temporal abstraction, which often leads to unstable optimization and inefficient credit assignment.\n  We propose HiPER, a novel Hierarchical Plan-Execute RL framework that explicitly separates high-level planning from low-level execution. HiPER factorizes the policy into a high-level planner that proposes subgoals and a low-level executor that carries them out over multiple action steps. To align optimization with this structure, we introduce a key technique called hierarchical advantage estimation (HAE), which carefully assigns credit at both the planning and execution levels. By aggregating returns over the execution of each subgoal and coordinating updates across the two levels, HAE provides an unbiased gradient estimator and provably reduces variance compared to flat generalized advantage estimation.\n  Empirically, HiPER achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging interactive benchmarks, reaching 97.4\\% success on ALFWorld and 83.3\\% on WebShop with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (+6.6\\% and +8.3\\% over the best prior method), with especially large gains on long-horizon tasks requiring multiple dependent subtasks.

However, existing monocular SSC approaches often lack explicit modeling of voxel-feature reliability and regulated cross-scale information propagation during 2D-3D projection and multi-scale fusion, making them vulnerable to projection diffusion and feature entanglement and thus limiting structural stability.To address these challenges, this paper presents an Adaptive Multi-scale Attention Aggregation (AMAA) framework built upon the MonoScene pipeline. Rather than introducing a heavier backbone, AMAA focuses on reliability-oriented feature regulation within a monocular SSC framework. Specifically, lifted voxel features are jointly calibrated in semantic and spatial dimensions through parallel channel-spatial attention aggregation, while multi-scale encoder-decoder fusion is stabilized via a hierarchical adaptive feature-gating strategy that regulates information injection across scales.Experiments on the NYUv2 benchmark demonstrate consistent improvements over MonoScene without significantly increasing system complexity: AMAA achieves 27.25% SSC mIoU (+0.31) and 43.10% SC IoU (+0.59). In addition, system-level deployment on an NVIDIA Jetson platform verifies that the complete AMAA framework can be executed stably on embedded hardware. Overall, AMAA improves monocular SSC quality and provides a reliable and deployable perception framework for indoor assistive systems targeting visually impaired users.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recently, the Muon optimizer has shown promise by performing orthogonalized updates in the singular-vector basis of the gradient, thereby improving geometric conditioning. However, its unit-singular-value updates may lead to overly aggressive steps and lack explicit stability guarantees when applied to physics-informed learning. In this work, we propose SpecMuon, a spectral-aware optimizer that integrates Muon's orthogonalized geometry with a mode-wise relaxed scalar auxiliary variable (RSAV) mechanism. By decomposing matrix-valued gradients into singular modes and applying RSAV updates individually along dominant spectral directions, SpecMuon adaptively regulates step sizes according to the global loss energy while preserving Muon's scale-balancing properties. This formulation interprets optimization as a multi-mode gradient flow and enables principled control of stiff spectral components. We establish rigorous theoretical properties of SpecMuon, including a modified energy dissipation law, positivity and boundedness of auxiliary variables, and global convergence with a linear rate under the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition. Numerical experiments on physics-informed neural networks, DeepONets, and fractional PINN-DeepONets demonstrate that SpecMuon achieves faster convergence and improved stability compared with Adam, AdamW, and the original Muon optimizer on benchmark problems such as the one-dimensional Burgers equation and fractional partial differential equations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we propose ReMoRa, a video MLLM that processes videos by operating directly on their compressed representations. A sparse set of RGB keyframes is retained for appearance, while temporal dynamics are encoded as a motion representation, removing the need for sequential RGB frames. These motion representations act as a compact proxy for optical flow, capturing temporal dynamics without full frame decoding. To refine the noise and low fidelity of block-based motions, we introduce a module to denoise and generate a fine-grained motion representation.

In this work, we propose a privacy-preserving federated learning framework for energy theft detection that addresses both privacy and computational constraints. Our approach leverages a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) model, suitable for deployment on low-power smart meters, and integrates basic differential privacy (DP) by injecting Gaussian noise into local model updates before aggregation.

Existing models often struggle with visually dense charts, leading to errors like data omission, misalignment, and hallucination. Inspired by the human strategy of using a finger as a ``visual anchor'' to ensure accuracy when reading complex charts, we propose a new paradigm named Visual Self-Refine (VSR). The core idea of VSR is to enable a model to generate pixel-level localization outputs, visualize them, and then feed these visualizations back to itself, allowing it to intuitively inspect and correct its own potential visual perception errors. We instantiate the VSR paradigm in the domain of Chart Parsing by proposing ChartVSR. This model decomposes the parsing process into two stages: a Refine Stage, where it iteratively uses visual feedback to ensure the accuracy of all data points' Pixel-level Localizations, and a Decode Stage, where it uses these verified localizations as precise visual anchors to parse the final structured data. To address the limitations of existing benchmarks, we also construct ChartP-Bench, a new and highly challenging benchmark for chart parsing.

We introduce Temporal-Prior Conditioning (TPC), which elevates time to a first-class modality that conditions the model at multiple depths. TPC attaches a small set of learnable time series tokens to the patch stream; at selected layers these tokens cross-attend to temporal embeddings derived from compact, human-readable temporal descriptors encoded by the same frozen LLM, then feed temporal context back via self-attention. This disentangles time series signal and temporal information while maintaining a low parameter budget. We show that by training only the cross-attention modules and explicitly disentangling time series signal and temporal information, TPC consistently outperforms both full fine-tuning and shallow conditioning strategies, achieving state-of-the-art performance in long-term forecasting across diverse datasets.

To address this issue, we introduce a mapping paradigm that reshapes the input coordinates through differentiable geometric compactification mappings and couples the geometric structure of PDEs with the spectral properties of residual operators. Based on this paradigm, we propose Geometric Compactification (GC)-PINN, a framework that introduces three mapping strategies for periodic boundaries, far-field scale expansion, and localized singular structures in the input domain without modifying the underlying PINN architecture.

Progress in defending these models lags behind classification, hindered by a lack of standardized evaluation. It is nearly impossible to thoroughly compare attack or defense methods, as existing work uses different datasets, inconsistent efficiency metrics, and varied measures of perturbation cost. This paper addresses this gap by investigating three key questions: (1) How can we create a fair benchmark to impartially compare attacks? (2) How well do modern attacks transfer across different architectures, especially from Convolutional Neural Networks to Vision Transformers? (3) What is the most effective adversarial training strategy for robust defense? To answer these, we first propose a unified benchmark framework focused on digital, non-patch-based attacks. This framework introduces specific metrics to disentangle localization and classification errors and evaluates attack cost using multiple perceptual metrics. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art attacks and a wide range of detectors. Our findings reveal two major conclusions: first, modern adversarial attacks against object detection models show a significant lack of transferability to transformer-based architectures. Second, we demonstrate that the most robust adversarial training strategy leverages a dataset composed of a mix of high-perturbation attacks with different objectives (e.g., spatial and semantic), which outperforms training on any single attack.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing feed-forward methods struggle with diverse poses and viewpoints, while optimization-based approaches are computationally expensive and difficult to scale. This paper focuses on sewing pattern generation for garment modeling and fabrication applications that demand editable, separable, and simulation-ready garments. We propose DressWild, a novel feed-forward pipeline that reconstructs physics-consistent 2D sewing patterns and the corresponding 3D garments from a single in-the-wild image. Given an input image, our method leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to normalize pose variations at the image level, then extract pose-aware, 3D-informed garment features. These features are fused through a transformer-based encoder and subsequently used to predict sewing pattern parameters, which can be directly applied to physical simulation, texture synthesis, and multi-layer virtual try-on. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach robustly recovers diverse sewing patterns and the corresponding 3D garments from in-the-wild images without requiring multi-view inputs or iterative optimization, offering an efficient and scalable solution for realistic garment simulation and animation.", "AI": {"tldr": "DressWild\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u91cd\u5efa\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u76842D\u7f1d\u5236\u56fe\u6848\u53ca\u76f8\u5e943D\u670d\u88c5\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u8f93\u5165\u6216\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u670d\u88c5\u56fe\u6848\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u524d\u9988\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u59ff\u52bf\u548c\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u670d\u88c5\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5236\u9020\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u7f16\u8f91\u3001\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u4e14\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u4eff\u771f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLMs\uff09\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5c42\u9762\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u59ff\u52bf\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u53d6\u59ff\u52bf\u611f\u77e5\u76843D\u670d\u88c5\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7transformer\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u878d\u5408\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u7f1d\u5236\u56fe\u6848\u53c2\u6570\uff1b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u6848\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u7528\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u4eff\u771f\u3001\u7eb9\u7406\u5408\u6210\u548c\u591a\u5c42\u865a\u62df\u8bd5\u7a7f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u7a33\u5065\u5730\u4ece\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u7f1d\u5236\u56fe\u6848\u53ca\u76f8\u5e943D\u670d\u88c5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u8f93\u5165\u6216\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "DressWild\u4e3a\u771f\u5b9e\u670d\u88c5\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u52a8\u753b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

As tasks and definitions evolve, such models cannot accommodate emerging distinctions and collecting new annotations and retraining to accommodate such changes is costly. To address these challenges, we introduce category splitting, a new task where an existing classifier is edited to refine a coarse category into finer subcategories, while preserving accuracy elsewhere. We propose a zero-shot editing method that leverages the latent compositional structure of video classifiers to expose fine-grained distinctions without additional data. We further show that low-shot fine-tuning, while simple, is highly effective and benefits from our zero-shot initialization. Experiments on our new video benchmarks for category splitting demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms vision-language baselines, improving accuracy on the newly split categories without sacrificing performance on the rest.

Existing approaches often abstract adaptation objectives as a reward function and steer diffusion models to generate high-reward samples. However, these approaches can incur high computational overhead due to additional training, or rely on stringent assumptions on the reward such as differentiability. Moreover, despite their empirical success, theoretical justification and guarantees are seldom established. In this paper, we propose DOIT (Doob-Oriented Inference-time Transformation), a training-free and computationally efficient adaptation method that applies to generic, non-differentiable rewards. The key framework underlying our method is a measure transport formulation that seeks to transport the pre-trained generative distribution to a high-reward target distribution. We leverage Doob's $h$-transform to realize this transport, which induces a dynamic correction to the diffusion sampling process and enables efficient simulation-based computation without modifying the pre-trained model. Theoretically, we establish a high probability convergence guarantee to the target high-reward distribution via characterizing the approximation error in the dynamic Doob's correction.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by comparing the morphing attack potential metric on two large-scale sequestered face morphing attack detection datasets against several state-of-the-art morphing methods, as well as on two novel morphed face datasets derived from FEI and ONOT.

It remains computationally demanding whether training from scratch, initialising from pre-trained weights, or fine-tuning large models. Although pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP offer rich image representations, existing adaptation or fine-tuning methods often rely on their global image embeddings, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained, localised attributes essential in complex, cluttered street scenes. To address this, we propose CLIP-MHAdapter, a variant of the current lightweight CLIP adaptation paradigm that appends a bottleneck MLP equipped with multi-head self-attention operating on patch tokens to model inter-patch dependencies. With approximately 1.4 million trainable parameters, CLIP-MHAdapter achieves superior or competitive accuracy across eight attribute classification tasks on the Global StreetScapes dataset, attaining new state-of-the-art results while maintaining low computational cost.

Adversarial approaches require target-domain adversarial loss during training, which can limit generalization to unseen data, while diffusion-inversion methods often produce low-fidelity translations due to imperfect inversion into noise-latent representations. In this work, we propose the Self-Supervised Semantic Bridge (SSB), a versatile framework that integrates external semantic priors into diffusion bridge models to enable spatially faithful translation without cross-domain supervision. Our key idea is to leverage self-supervised visual encoders to learn representations that are invariant to appearance changes but capture geometric structure, forming a shared latent space that conditions the diffusion bridges. Extensive experiments show that SSB outperforms strong prior methods for challenging medical image synthesis in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, and extends easily to high-quality text-guided editing.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing query-based methods often employ random query initialization and depend on implicit temporal modeling, which lead to temporal inconsistencies and instabilities during the construction of a global map. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel end-to-end framework for consistent online HD vectorized map construction, which jointly performs map instance tracking and short-term prediction. First, we propose a Semantic-Aware Query Generator that initializes queries with spatially aligned semantic masks to capture scene-level context globally. Next, we design a History Rasterized Map Memory to store fine-grained instance-level maps for each tracked instance, enabling explicit historical priors. A History-Map Guidance Module then integrates rasterized map information into track queries, improving temporal continuity. Finally, we propose a Short-Term Future Guidance module to forecast the immediate motion of map instances based on the stored history trajectories. These predicted future locations serve as hints for tracked instances to further avoid implausible predictions and keep temporal consistency.

However, existing foundation models face a fundamental trade-off: 1D temporal models provide fine-grained pointwise localization but lack a global contextual perspective, while 2D vision-based models capture global patterns but suffer from information bottlenecks due to a lack of temporal alignment and coarse-grained pointwise detection. To resolve this dilemma, we propose VETime, the first TSAD framework that unifies temporal and visual modalities through fine-grained visual-temporal alignment and dynamic fusion. VETime introduces a Reversible Image Conversion and a Patch-Level Temporal Alignment module to establish a shared visual-temporal timeline, preserving discriminative details while maintaining temporal sensitivity. Furthermore, we design an Anomaly Window Contrastive Learning mechanism and a Task-Adaptive Multi-Modal Fusion to adaptively integrate the complementary perceptual strengths of both modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VETime significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in zero-shot scenarios, achieving superior localization precision with lower computational overhead than current vision-based approaches.

In this work, we show that KANs share the same permutation symmetries as MLPs, and propose the KAN-graph, a graph representation of their computation. Building on this, we develop WS-KAN, the first weight-space architecture that learns on KANs, which naturally accounts for their symmetry. We analyze WS-KAN's expressive power, showing it can replicate an input KAN's forward pass - a standard approach for assessing expressiveness in weight-space architectures. We construct a comprehensive ``zoo'' of trained KANs spanning diverse tasks, which we use as benchmarks to empirically evaluate WS-KAN.

To bridge this gap, we introduce SAW-Bench (Situated Awareness in the Real World), a novel benchmark for evaluating egocentric situated awareness using real-world videos. SAW-Bench comprises 786 self-recorded videos captured with Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses spanning diverse indoor and outdoor environments, and over 2,071 human-annotated question-answer pairs. It probes a model's observer-centric understanding with six different awareness tasks. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals a human-model performance gap of 37.66%, even with the best-performing MFM, Gemini 3 Flash. Beyond this gap, our in-depth analysis uncovers several notable findings; for example, while models can exploit partial geometric cues in egocentric videos, they often fail to infer a coherent camera geometry, leading to systematic spatial reasoning errors. We position SAW-Bench as a benchmark for situated spatial intelligence, moving beyond passive observation to understanding physically grounded, observer-centric dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce a Visual Question Answering benchmark across three controlled visual worlds (CLEVRTex, Super-CLEVR, and MOVi-C) to measure how well vision encoders, with and without object-centric biases, generalize to unseen combinations of object properties. To ensure a fair and comprehensive comparison, we carefully account for training data diversity, sample size, representation size, downstream model capacity, and compute. We use DINOv2 and SigLIP2, two widely used vision encoders, as the foundation models and their OC counterparts. Our key findings reveal that (1) OC approaches are superior in harder compositional generalization settings; (2) original dense representations surpass OC only on easier settings and typically require substantially more downstream compute; and (3) OC models are more sample efficient, achieving stronger generalization with fewer images, whereas dense encoders catch up or surpass them only with sufficient data and diversity. Overall, object-centric representations offer stronger compositional generalization when any one of dataset size, training data diversity, or downstream compute is constrained.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

SEMixer features two key components: a Random Attention Mechanism (RAM) and a Multiscale Progressive Mixing Chain (MPMC). RAM captures diverse time-patch interactions during training and aggregates them via dropout ensemble at inference, enhancing patch-level semantics and enabling MLP-Mixer to better model multi-scale dependencies. MPMC further stacks RAM and MLP-Mixer in a memory-efficient manner, achieving more effective temporal mixing. It addresses semantic gaps across scales and facilitates better multiscale modeling and forecasting performance.

While allocating additional inference-time computation has proven effective for large language models (LLMs), achieving similar scaling in VLMs remains challenging. A key obstacle is that visual inputs are typically provided only once at the start of generation, while textual reasoning (e.g., early visual summaries) is generated autoregressively, causing reasoning to become increasingly text-dominated and allowing early visual grounding errors to accumulate. Moreover, vanilla guidance for visual grounding during inference is often coarse and noisy, making it difficult to steer reasoning over long texts. To address these challenges, we propose \\emph{Saliency-Aware Principle} (SAP) selection. SAP operates on high-level reasoning principles rather than token-level trajectories, which enable stable control over discrete generation under noisy feedback while allowing later reasoning steps to re-consult visual evidence when renewed grounding is required. In addition, SAP supports multi-route inference, enabling parallel exploration of diverse reasoning behaviors. SAP is model-agnostic and data-free, requiring no additional training. Empirical results show that SAP achieves competitive performance, especially in reducing object hallucination, under comparable token-generation budgets while yielding more stable reasoning and lower response latency than CoT-style long sequential reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While many deep learning models have achieved promising performance, few consider how to identify and penalize low-predictability samples to improve model performance from the training perspective. To fill this gap, we propose a general Amortized Predictability-aware Training Framework (APTF) for both TSF and TSC. APTF introduces two key designs that enable the model to focus on high-predictability samples while still learning appropriately from low-predictability ones: (i) a Hierarchical Predictability-aware Loss (HPL) that dynamically identifies low-predictability samples and progressively expands their loss penalty as training evolves, and (ii) an amortization model that mitigates predictability estimation errors caused by model bias, further enhancing HPL's effectiveness.

Hypernetwork-based approaches predict INR weights (hyponetworks) for unseen videos at high speeds, but with low quality, large compressed size, and prohibitive memory needs at higher resolutions. We address these fundamental limitations through three key contributions: (1) an approach that decomposes the weight prediction task spatially and temporally, by breaking short video segments into patch tubelets, to reduce the pretraining memory overhead by 20$\\times$; (2) a residual-based storage scheme that captures only differences between consecutive segment representations, significantly reducing bitstream size; and (3) a temporal coherence regularization framework that encourages changes in the weight space to be correlated with video content.

This paper introduces Factored Latent Action Model (FLAM), a factored dynamics framework that decomposes the scene into independent factors, each inferring its own latent action and predicting its own next-step factor value. This factorized structure enables more accurate modeling of complex multi-entity dynamics and improves video generation quality in action-free video settings compared to monolithic models.

While extensively studied in machine learning, bias spillover remains critically underexplored in LLM alignment. In this work, we investigate how targeted gender alignment affects fairness across nine sensitive attributes in three state-of-the-art LLMs (Mistral 7B, Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B). Using Direct Preference Optimization and the BBQ benchmark, we evaluate fairness under ambiguous and disambiguous contexts. Our findings reveal noticeable bias spillover: while aggregate results show improvements, context-aware analysis exposes significant degradations in ambiguous contexts, particularly for physical appearance ($p< 0.001$ across all models), sexual orientation, and disability status.

In deployed settings, long contexts are typically managed through compaction in token space via summarization. However, summarization can be highly lossy, substantially harming downstream performance. Recent work on Cartridges has shown that it is possible to train highly compact KV caches in latent space that closely match full-context performance, but at the cost of slow and expensive end-to-end optimization. This work describes an approach for fast context compaction in latent space through Attention Matching, which constructs compact keys and values to reproduce attention outputs and preserve attention mass at a per-KV-head level. We show that this formulation naturally decomposes into simple subproblems, some of which admit efficient closed-form solutions. Within this framework, we develop a family of methods that significantly push the Pareto frontier of compaction time versus quality, achieving up to 50x compaction in seconds on some datasets with little quality loss.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we present the first systematic study addressing this scalability bottleneck. We challenge the prevailing assumption that the entire training data is necessary, uncovering the phenomenon of Posterior Progressive Concentration: the effective golden support of the denoising score is not static but shrinks asymptotically from the global manifold to a local neighborhood as the signal-to-noise ratio increases. Capitalizing on this, we propose Dynamic Time-Aware Golden Subset Diffusion (GoldDiff), a training-free framework that decouples inference complexity from dataset size. Instead of static retrieval, GoldDiff uses a coarse-to-fine mechanism to dynamically pinpoint the ''Golden Subset'' for inference. Theoretically, we derive rigorous bounds guaranteeing that our sparse approximation converges to the exact score. Empirically, GoldDiff achieves a $\\bf 71 \\times$ speedup on AFHQ while matching or achieving even better performance than full-scan baselines.

As a result, effects remain locally additive while varying across subregions to capture interactions. We further propose a principled distillation-based training pipeline that identifies homogeneous regions with limited interactions and fits interpretable shape functions via region-aware backfitting.

Trained on 18,588 basins curated from the CARAVAN dataset, AIFL utilises a novel two-stage training strategy to bridge the reanalysis-to-forecast domain shift. The model is first pre-trained on 40 years of ERA5-Land reanalysis (1980-2019) to capture robust hydrological processes, then fine-tuned on operational Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) control forecasts (2016-2019) to adapt to the specific error structures and biases of operational numerical weather prediction. To our knowledge, this is the first global model trained end-to-end within the CARAVAN ecosystem. On an independent temporal test set (2021-2024), AIFL achieves high predictive skill with a median modified Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE') of 0.66 and a median Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 0.53.

Experiments were conducted on three publicly available MEG datasets spanning different acquisition sites, scanners, and experimental paradigms. Our results show that both learnable and non-learnable discretization schemes achieve high reconstruction accuracy and broadly comparable performance across most evaluation criteria, suggesting that simple fixed sample-level tokenization strategies can be used in the development of neural foundation models.

Differential temporal difference (TD) learning algorithms are a major advance for average reward RL as they provide an efficient online method to learn the value functions associated with the average reward in both on-policy and off-policy settings. However, existing convergence guarantees require a local clock in learning rates tied to state visit counts, which practitioners do not use and does not extend beyond tabular settings. We address this limitation by proving the almost sure convergence of on-policy $n$-step differential TD for any $n$ using standard diminishing learning rates without a local clock. We then derive three sufficient conditions under which off-policy $n$-step differential TD also converges without a local clock.

We recover several recently proposed preconditioning methods for LoRA as special cases, and show that LoRSum can also be used for updating a low-rank momentum. In order to address full steps with preconditioned gradient descent, we propose a scaled variant of LoRSum that uses structured metrics such as K-FAC and Shampoo, and we show that storing the diagonal of these metrics still allows them to perform well while remaining memory-efficient. Experiments on a synthetic task, CIFAR-100, and language-model fine-tuning on GLUE, SQuAD v2, and WikiText-103, show that our method can match or improve LoRA baselines given modest compute overhead, while avoiding full-matrix SVD projections and retaining LoRA-style parameter efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this within standard deep learning benchmark settings, we propose the Hierarchical Patching Mixer (HPMixer), which models periodicity and residuals in a decoupled yet complementary manner. The periodic component utilizes a learnable cycle module [7] enhanced with a nonlinear channel-wise MLP for greater expressiveness. The residual component is processed through a Learnable Stationary Wavelet Transform (LSWT) to extract stable, shift-invariant frequency-domain representations. Subsequently, a channel-mixing encoder models explicit inter-channel dependencies, while a two-level non-overlapping hierarchical patching mechanism captures coarse- and fine-scale residual variations. By integrating decoupled periodicity modeling with structured, multi-scale residual learning, HPMixer provides an effective framework.

In recent years, this problem is increasingly tackled using deep learning methods. A common strategy involves predicting a molecular fingerprint vector from an input mass spectrum, which is then used to search for matches in a chemical compound database. While various loss functions are employed in training these predictive models, their impact on model performance remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigate commonly used loss functions, deriving novel regret bounds that characterize when Bayes-optimal decisions for these objectives must diverge. Our results reveal a fundamental trade-off between the two objectives of (1) fingerprint similarity and (2) molecular retrieval. Optimizing for more accurate fingerprint predictions typically worsens retrieval results, and vice versa. Our theoretical analysis shows this trade-off depends on the similarity structure of candidate sets, providing guidance for loss function and fingerprint selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d28\u8c31\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5b50\u6307\u7eb9\u65f6\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u5206\u5b50\u68c0\u7d22\u76ee\u6807\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6307\u7eb9\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u68c0\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u53cd\u4e4b\u4ea6\u7136\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6743\u8861\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5019\u9009\u96c6\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "\u6db2\u76f8\u8272\u8c31-\u4e32\u8054\u8d28\u8c31\uff08LC-MS/MS\uff09\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u662f\u4ece\u8f93\u51fa\u8c31\u56fe\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u5316\u5408\u7269\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5df2\u88ab\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7528\u4e8e\u6b64\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5b50\u6307\u7eb9\u5411\u91cf\u5e76\u641c\u7d22\u5316\u5408\u7269\u6570\u636e\u5e93\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u540c\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u6e05\u6670\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86\u5e38\u7528\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u65b0\u7684\u9057\u61be\u754c\u9650\u6765\u523b\u753b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6700\u4f18\u51b3\u7b56\u4f55\u65f6\u5fc5\u987b\u53d1\u6563\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u6548\u679c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6307\u7eb9\u9884\u6d4b\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u6076\u5316\u68c0\u7d22\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u53cd\u4e4b\u4ea6\u7136\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6743\u8861\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5019\u9009\u96c6\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u6307\u7eb9\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8d28\u8c31\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u5206\u5b50\u6307\u7eb9\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u4e0d\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u6307\u7eb9\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u68c0\u7d22\u4e24\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u505a\u51fa\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u548c\u5206\u5b50\u6307\u7eb9\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

We compare two training regimes: a one-stage agent that jointly selects the gate type, the affected qubit(s), and the rotation angle; and a two-stage variant that first proposes a discrete circuit and subsequently optimizes the rotation angles with Adam using parameter-shift gradients. Using Gymnasium and PennyLane, we evaluate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Advantage Actor--Critic (A2C) on systems comprising two to ten qubits and on targets of increasing complexity with \\(\u03bb\\) ranging from one to five. Whereas A2C does not learn effective policies in this setting, PPO succeeds under stable hyperparameters (one-stage: learning rate approximately \\(5\\times10^{-4}\\) with a self-fidelity-error threshold of 0.01; two-stage: learning rate approximately \\(10^{-4}\\)). Both approaches reliably reconstruct computational basis states (between 83\\% and 99\\% success) and Bell states (between 61\\% and 77\\% success).

It aims to maintain electricity grid capacity limits and prevent congestion by financially incentivising end users to reduce or shift their energy consumption. The proposed framework adopts a hierarchical architecture in which a service provider adjusts hourly incentive rates based on wholesale electricity prices and aggregated residential load. The financial interests of both the service provider and end users are explicitly considered. A deep reinforcement learning approach is employed to learn optimal real-time incentive rates under explicit capacity constraints. Heterogeneous user preferences are modelled through appliance-level home energy management systems and dissatisfaction costs. Using real-world residential electricity consumption and price data from three households, simulation results show that the proposed approach effectively reduces peak demand and smooths the aggregated load profile. This leads to an approximately 22.82% reduction in the peak-to-average ratio compared to the no-demand-response case.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bb9\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u7684\u6fc0\u52b1\u578b\u9700\u6c42\u54cd\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u65f6\u6fc0\u52b1\u8d39\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u8003\u8651\u7528\u6237\u6ee1\u610f\u5ea6\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u5cf0\u503c\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u5e73\u6ed1\u8d1f\u8377\u66f2\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4f\u5b85\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u7f51\u4e2d\u7684\u5bb9\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u9884\u9632\u7535\u7f51\u62e5\u5835\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5e73\u8861\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u548c\u7ec8\u7aef\u7528\u6237\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5229\u76ca\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u534f\u8c03\u591a\u65b9\u5229\u76ca\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u5f02\u8d28\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u54cd\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u670d\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5546\u6839\u636e\u6279\u53d1\u7535\u4ef7\u683c\u548c\u805a\u5408\u4f4f\u5b85\u8d1f\u8377\u8c03\u6574\u5c0f\u65f6\u7ea7\u6fc0\u52b1\u8d39\u7387\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u660e\u786e\u5bb9\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u5b9e\u65f6\u6fc0\u52b1\u8d39\u7387\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u5907\u7ea7\u5bb6\u5ead\u80fd\u6e90\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u4e0d\u6ee1\u6210\u672c\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u4e2a\u5bb6\u5ead\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u7528\u7535\u548c\u7535\u4ef7\u6570\u636e\u4eff\u771f\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5cf0\u503c\u9700\u6c42\u5e76\u4f7f\u805a\u5408\u8d1f\u8377\u66f2\u7ebf\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u4e0e\u975e\u9700\u6c42\u54cd\u5e94\u60c5\u51b5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5cf0\u5747\u6bd4\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7ea622.82%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5bb9\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u6fc0\u52b1\u578b\u9700\u6c42\u54cd\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u53ef\u884c\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7ef4\u62a4\u7535\u7f51\u5bb9\u91cf\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u591a\u65b9\u5229\u76ca\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u7535\u7f51\u8d1f\u8377\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4f4f\u5b85\u667a\u80fd\u7535\u7f51\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, most existing Safe RL methods assume benign environments, making them vulnerable to adversarial perturbations commonly encountered in real-world settings. In addition, existing gradient-based adversarial attacks typically require access to the policy's gradient information, which is often impractical in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose an adversarial attack framework to reveal vulnerabilities of Safe RL policies. Using expert demonstrations and black-box environment interaction, our framework learns a constraint model and a surrogate (learner) policy, enabling gradient-based attack optimization without requiring the victim policy's internal gradients or the ground-truth safety constraints. We further provide theoretical analysis establishing feasibility and deriving perturbation bounds. Experiments on multiple Safe RL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach under limited privileged access.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While recent deep learning approaches have advanced this field, they are typically optimized and evaluated using native sequence recovery, which is a limited surrogate for structural fidelity, since different sequences can fold into similar 3D structures and high recovery does not necessarily indicate correct folding. To address this limitation, we propose RIDER, an RNA Inverse DEsign framework with Reinforcement learning that directly optimizes for 3D structural similarity. First, we develop and pre-train a GNN-based generative diffusion model conditioned on the target 3D structure, achieving a 9% improvement in native sequence recovery over state-of-the-art methods. Then, we fine-tune the model with an improved policy gradient algorithm using four task-specific reward functions based on 3D self-consistency metrics. Experimental results show that RIDER improves structural similarity by over 100% across all metrics and discovers designs that are distinct from native sequences.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While parameter sharing in VQCs can reduce the parameter space dimensionality and potentially mitigate the barren plateau phenomenon, it introduces a complex trade-off that has been largely overlooked. This paper investigates how parameter sharing, despite creating better global optima with fewer parameters, fundamentally alters the optimization landscape through deceptive gradients -- regions where gradient information exists but systematically misleads optimizers away from global optima. Through systematic experimental analysis, we demonstrate that increasing degrees of parameter sharing generate more complex solution landscapes with heightened gradient magnitudes and measurably higher deceptiveness ratios. Our findings reveal that traditional gradient-based optimizers (Adam, SGD) show progressively degraded convergence as parameter sharing increases, with performance heavily dependent on hyperparameter selection. We introduce a novel gradient deceptiveness detection algorithm and a quantitative framework for measuring optimization difficulty in quantum circuits, establishing that while parameter sharing can improve circuit expressivity by orders of magnitude, this comes at the cost of significantly increased landscape deceptiveness. These insights provide important considerations for quantum circuit design in practical applications, highlighting the fundamental mismatch between classical optimization strategies and quantum parameter landscapes shaped by parameter sharing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def(VQCs)\u4e2d\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5e76\u53ef\u80fd\u7f13\u89e3\u8d2b\u7620\u9ad8\u539f\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\u68af\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f18\u5316\u96be\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u8868\u73b0\u53d8\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u5728\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u4e2d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u73b0\u8c61\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u751a\u81f3\u63d0\u9ad8\u7535\u8def\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u4f18\u5316\u666f\u89c2\u5374\u4e00\u76f4\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\uff0c\u8fd9\u5173\u7cfb\u5230\u91cf\u5b50\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u68af\u5ea6\u5bf9\u4f18\u5316\u5730\u8c8c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u65b0\u578b\u68af\u5ea6\u6b3a\u9a97\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u96be\u5ea6\uff1b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u5668(Adam\u3001SGD)\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1.\u589e\u52a0\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u89e3\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u5e45\u5ea6\u589e\u5927\u4e14\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\u6bd4\u4f8b\u63d0\u9ad8\uff1b2.\u4f20\u7edf\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u6536\u655b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u9009\u62e9\uff1b3.\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u80fd\u5c06\u7535\u8def\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u4f46\u4ee3\u4ef7\u662f\u4f18\u5316\u5730\u8c8c\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53c2\u6570\u5171\u4eab\u5728\u53d8\u5206\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u6743\u8861\u2014\u2014\u7535\u8def\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u4f34\u968f\u4f18\u5316\u96be\u5ea6\u7684\u663e\u8457\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7ecf\u5178\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u91cf\u5b50\u53c2\u6570\u666f\u89c2\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6839\u672c\u6027\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8003\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u3002"}}

Such algorithms have been proposed for tasks ranging from inverse problems and guided image generation to reasoning. However, the methods currently deployed in practice are heuristics with a variety of failure modes -- and we have very little understanding of when these heuristics can be efficiently improved.\n  In this paper, we consider the task of sampling from a reward-tilted diffusion model -- that is, sampling from $p^{\\star}(x) \\propto p(x) \\exp(r(x))$ -- given a reward function $r$ and pre-trained diffusion oracle for $p$. We provide a fine-grained analysis of the computational tractability of this task for quadratic rewards $r(x) = x^\\top A x + b^\\top x$. We show that linear-reward tilts are always efficiently sampleable -- a simple result that seems to have gone unnoticed in the literature. We use this as a building block, along with a conceptually new ingredient -- the Hubbard-Stratonovich transform -- to provide an efficient algorithm for sampling from low-rank positive-definite quadratic tilts, i.e. $r(x) = x^\\top A x$ where $A$ is positive-definite and of rank $O(1)$. For negative-definite tilts, i.e. $r(x) = - x^\\top A x$ where $A$ is positive-definite, we prove that the problem is intractable even if $A$ is of rank 1 (albeit with exponentially-large entries).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4e8c\u6b21\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u8fdb\u884c\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u603b\u662f\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u4f4e\u79e9\u6b63\u5b9a\u4e8c\u6b21\u5956\u52b1\u4e5f\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u4f46\u8d1f\u5b9a\u4e8c\u6b21\u5956\u52b1\u5373\u4f7f\u79e9\u4e3a1\u4e5f\u662f\u96be\u4ee5\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7b97\u6cd5\u591a\u662f\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5956\u52b1\u503e\u659c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9488\u5bf9\u4e8c\u6b21\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u503e\u659c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u6784\u4ef6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Hubbard-Stratonovich\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u4f4e\u79e9\u6b63\u5b9a\u4e8c\u6b21\u5956\u52b1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u8d1f\u5b9a\u4e8c\u6b21\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u96be\u89e3\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7ebf\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u503e\u659c\u603b\u662f\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u91c7\u6837\uff1b\u4f4e\u79e9\u6b63\u5b9a\u4e8c\u6b21\u5956\u52b1\uff08\u79e9\u4e3aO(1)\uff09\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u91c7\u6837\uff1b\u8d1f\u5b9a\u4e8c\u6b21\u5956\u52b1\u5373\u4f7f\u79e9\u4e3a1\u4e14\u7cfb\u6570\u6307\u6570\u5927\u4e5f\u662f\u96be\u89e3\u7684\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u4e8c\u6b21\u5956\u52b1\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5956\u52b1\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u3002"}}

By leveraging data fusion and analytics techniques, traffic demand forecasting serves as a key intermediate measure for identifying emerging spatial and temporal demand patterns. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by proposing two gradient boosting model variations, one for classiffication and one for regression, both capable of generating demand forecasts at various temporal horizons, from 5 minutes up to one hour. Our overall approach effectively integrates temporal and contextual features, enabling accurate predictions that are essential for improving the efficiency of shared (micro-) mobility services. To evaluate its effectiveness, we utilize open shared mobility data derived from e-scooter and e-bike networks in five metropolitan areas. These real-world datasets allow us to compare our approach with state-of-the-art methods as well as a Generative AI-based model, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing the complexities of modern urban mobility.

They go through multiple updates in their lifecycles. Thus, exploiting the model dynamics to create stronger Membership Inference (MI) attacks and tighter privacy audits are timely questions. Though the literature empirically shows that using a sequence of model updates can increase the power of MI attacks, rigorous analysis of the `optimal' MI attacks is limited to static models with infinite samples. Hence, we develop an `optimal' MI attack, SeMI*, that uses the sequence of model updates to identify the presence of a target inserted at a certain update step. For the empirical mean computation, we derive the optimal power of SeMI*, while accessing a finite number of samples with or without privacy. Our results retrieve the existing asymptotic analysis. We observe that having access to the model sequence avoids the dilution of MI signals unlike the existing attacks on the final model, where the MI signal vanishes as training data accumulates. Furthermore, an adversary can use SeMI* to tune both the insertion time and the canary to yield tighter privacy audits. Finally, we conduct experiments across data distributions and models trained or fine-tuned with DP-SGD demonstrating that practical variants of SeMI* lead to tighter privacy audits than the baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A main interest in recent the literature is identifying the cop number of graph families. The cop number of a graph, $c(G)$, is defined as the minimum number of cops required to guarantee capture of the robber. Determining the cop number is computationally difficult and exact algorithms for this are typically restricted to small graph families. This paper investigates whether classical machine learning methods and graph neural networks can accurately predict a graph's cop number from its structural properties and identify which properties most strongly influence this prediction. Of the classical machine learning models, tree-based models achieve high accuracy in prediction despite class imbalance, whereas graph neural networks achieve comparable results without explicit feature engineering. The interpretability analysis shows that the most predictive features are related to node connectivity, clustering, clique structure, and width parameters, which aligns with known theoretical results. Our findings suggest that machine learning approaches can be used in complement with existing cop number algorithms by offering scalable approximations where computation is infeasible.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To enable practical control, we develop prompting mechanisms that let the users specify preferred transformation patterns during generation. We further introduce MMPT-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework that uses external reference analogs as contextual guidance to steer generation and generalize from project-specific series.

We present a reconstruction attack showing that for certain tasks, which can be computed securely without deletions, a mechanism adhering to perfect retraining allows an adversary controlling merely $\u03c9(1)$ data points to reconstruct almost the entire dataset merely by issuing deletion requests. We survey existing definitions for machine unlearning, showing they are either susceptible to such attacks or too restrictive to support basic functionalities like exact summation.

Our position is that causal inference specifies what constitutes a valid mapping from model activations to invariant high-level structures, the data or assumptions needed to achieve it, and the inferences it can support. Specifically, Pearl's causal hierarchy clarifies what an interpretability study can justify. Observations establish associations between model behaviour and internal components. Interventions (e.g., ablations or activation patching) support claims how these edits affect a behavioural metric (\\eg, average change in token probabilities) over a set of prompts. However, counterfactual claims -- i.e., asking what the model output would have been for the same prompt under an unobserved intervention -- remain largely unverifiable without controlled supervision. We show how causal representation learning (CRL) operationalises this hierarchy, specifying which variables are recoverable from activations and under what assumptions. Together, these motivate a diagnostic framework that helps practitioners select methods and evaluations matching claims to evidence such that findings generalise.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, estimation becomes challenging in the imbalanced regime, where one matrix dimension is much larger than the other. In EHR applications, cohort sizes are often limited by disease prevalence or data availability, whereas the feature space remains extremely large due to the breadth of medical coding system. Motivated by the increasing availability of external semantic embeddings, such as pre-trained embeddings of clinical concepts in EHRs, we propose a knowledge-embedded latent projection model that leverages semantic side information to regularize representation learning. Specifically, we model column embeddings as smooth functions of semantic embeddings via a mapping in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We develop a computationally efficient two-step estimation procedure that combines semantically guided subspace construction via kernel principal component analysis with scalable projected gradient descent. We establish estimation error bounds that characterize the trade-off between statistical error and approximation error induced by the kernel projection. Furthermore, we provide local convergence guarantees for our non-convex optimization procedure. Extensive simulation studies and a real-world EHR application demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
