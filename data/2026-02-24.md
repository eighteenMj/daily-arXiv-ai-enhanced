TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个名为COMPASS的人工智能驱动时间数字孪生系统，用于预测正常组织在放疗过程中的毒性反应。通过分析非小细胞肺癌患者在生物引导放疗中的每分次数据，系统能够提前几周预测毒性发生。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前临床决策主要依赖静态的群体NTCP模型，忽略了患者特有的动态生物轨迹信息。放疗正变得更加精确和数据密集，产生了适合AI建模的连续影像和剂量数据。

Method: 使用GRU自编码器学习器官特异性潜在轨迹，通过逻辑回归对轨迹进行分类以预测CTCAE 1级及以上毒性。系统整合了每分次的PET、CT、剂量组学、影像组学和累积生物等效剂量动力学数据。

Result: 尽管只有8名患者的小队列，但密集的时间表型分析揭示了可行的AI驱动早期预警窗口。研究发现在临床毒性出现前的几个分次中风险评分就开始上升。剂量驱动的表征揭示了在传统体积剂量学中被平均掉的生物相关空间剂量纹理特征。

Conclusion: COMPASS为AI驱动的自适应放疗建立了概念验证，证明可以通过持续更新的数字孪生来跟踪患者演化中的生物反应并指导治疗。

Abstract: Radiotherapy continues to become more precise and data dense, with current treatment regimens generating high frequency imaging and dosimetry streams ideally suited for AI driven temporal modeling to characterize how normal tissues evolve with time. Each fraction in biologically guided radiotherapy(BGRT) treated non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients records new metabolic, anatomical, and dose information. However, clinical decision making is largely informed by static, population based NTCP models which overlook the dynamic, unique biological trajectories encoded in sequential data. We developed COMPASS (Comprehensive Personalized Assessment System) for safe radiotherapy, functioning as a temporal digital twin architecture utilizing per fraction PET, CT, dosiomics, radiomics, and cumulative biologically equivalent dose (BED) kinetics to model normal tissue biology as a dynamic time series process. A GRU autoencoder was employed to learn organ specific latent trajectories, which were classified via logistic regression to predict eventual CTCAE grade 1 or higher toxicity. Eight NSCLC patients undergoing BGRT contributed to the 99 organ fraction observations covering 24 organ trajectories (spinal cord, heart, and esophagus). Despite the small cohort, intensive temporal phenotyping allowed for comprehensive analysis of individual dose response dynamics. Our findings revealed a viable AI driven early warning window, as increasing risk ratings occurred from several fractions before clinical toxicity. The dense BED driven representation revealed biologically relevant spatial dose texture characteristics that occur before toxicity and are averaged out with traditional volume based dosimetry. COMPASS establishes a proof of concept for AI enabled adaptive radiotherapy, where treatment is guided by a continually updated digital twin that tracks each patients evolving biological response.

TL;DR: MARVUS是一种移动增强现实乳腺超声体积测量系统，使用基础模型提高精度和一致性，无需专用探头或外部跟踪硬件，资源效率高且通用性强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前2D超声体积估计存在用户间高度变异性，而现有3D超声解决方案需要专用探头或外部跟踪硬件，成本高昂，可移植性差，限制了临床广泛应用。

Method: 提出Mobile Augmented Reality Volumetric Ultrasound系统，与传统超声系统互操作，使用基础模型增强跨专业泛化能力，最小化硬件要求。

Result: 在乳腺模型实验中，MARVUS显著提高体积估计精度（平均差异0.469 cm3），降低了用户间变异性（平均差异0.417 cm3），AR可视化增强了客观性能指标和用户体验。

Conclusion: MARVUS能以可扩展、成本可控和资源高效的方式增强基于超声的癌症筛查、诊断流程和治疗规划。

Abstract: Accurate volumetric characterization of lesions is essential for oncologic diagnosis, risk stratification, and treatment planning. While imaging modalities such as Computed Tomography provide high-quality 3D data, 2D ultrasound (2D-US) remains the preferred first-line modality for breast and thyroid imaging due to cost, portability, and safety factors. However, volume estimates derived from 2D-US suffer from high inter-user variability even among experienced clinicians. Existing 3D ultrasound (3D-US) solutions use specialized probes or external tracking hardware, but such configurations increase costs and diminish portability, constraining widespread clinical use. To address these limitations, we present Mobile Augmented Reality Volumetric Ultrasound (MARVUS), a resource-efficient system designed to increase accessibility to accurate and reproducible volumetric assessment. MARVUS is interoperable with conventional ultrasound (US) systems, using a foundation model to enhance cross-specialty generalization while minimizing hardware requirements relative to current 3D-US solutions. In a user study involving experienced clinicians performing measurements on breast phantoms, MARVUS yielded a substantial improvement in volume estimation accuracy (mean difference: 0.469 cm3) with reduced inter-user variability (mean difference: 0.417 cm3). Additionally, we prove that augmented reality (AR) visualizations enhance objective performance metrics and clinician-reported usability. Collectively, our findings suggests that MARVUS can enhance US-based cancer screening, diagnostic workflows, and treatment planning in a scalable, cost-conscious, and resource-efficient manner.

### [3] [Mitigating Shortcut Learning via Feature Disentanglement in Medical Imaging: A Benchmark Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18502)
*Sarah Müller,Philipp Berens*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这项研究系统评估了特征解耦方法在医学影像中缓解捷径学习的效果。在包含人工和医疗数据的实验中，发现结合数据重心平衡和模型中心解耦的方法能最有效地减轻捷径依赖，同时保持计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学影像中的深度学习模型可能依赖与目标任务无因果关系的伪相关或混杂因素（捷径学习），这在临床环境中存在风险，因为模型需要在不同机构、人群和设备条件下保持泛化能力。特征解耦是缓解这一问题的有前景的方法。

Method: 系统评估了特征解耦方法，包括对抗学习和基于依赖性最小化的潜在空间分割。使用一个人工数据集和两个带有自然与合成混杂因素的医学数据集，通过潜在空间分析评估分类性能和解耦质量。同时考察了不同混杂程度下的鲁棒性，并比较了计算效率。

Result: 捷径缓解方法在训练数据存在强伪相关时改善了分类性能。潜在空间分析揭示了分类指标未能捕捉的表征质量差异。模型对捷径的依赖程度取决于训练数据中的混杂水平。最佳模型结合了数据重心平衡与模型中心解耦，相比单独使用重平衡能更强大且鲁棒地缓解捷径，同时保持相似的计算效率。

Conclusion: 研究证实特征解耦方法能有效缓解医学影像中的捷径学习问题。综合数据重平衡和模型解耦的方法表现最佳，为开发更可靠、可泛化的临床AI模型提供了指导。

Abstract: Although deep learning models in medical imaging often achieve excellent classification performance, they can rely on shortcut learning, exploiting spurious correlations or confounding factors that are not causally related to the target task. This poses risks in clinical settings, where models must generalize across institutions, populations, and acquisition conditions. Feature disentanglement is a promising approach to mitigate shortcut learning by separating task-relevant information from confounder-related features in latent representations. In this study, we systematically evaluated feature disentanglement methods for mitigating shortcuts in medical imaging, including adversarial learning and latent space splitting based on dependence minimization. We assessed classification performance and disentanglement quality using latent space analyses across one artificial and two medical datasets with natural and synthetic confounders. We also examined robustness under varying levels of confounding and compared computational efficiency across methods. We found that shortcut mitigation methods improved classification performance under strong spurious correlations during training. Latent space analyses revealed differences in representation quality not captured by classification metrics, highlighting the strengths and limitations of each method. Model reliance on shortcuts depended on the degree of confounding in the training data. The best-performing models combine data-centric rebalancing with model-centric disentanglement, achieving stronger and more robust shortcut mitigation than rebalancing alone while maintaining similar computational efficiency.

### [4] [A Computer Vision Framework for Multi-Class Detection and Tracking in Soccer Broadcast Footage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18504)
*Daniel Tshiani*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一个端到端的单摄像头计算机视觉流程，用于从标准广播画面中提取足球运动员和球的追踪数据，帮助低预算球队实现基于数据的分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 专业俱乐部通过昂贵的多摄像头或GPS系统获取详细数据，而低预算球队无法负担类似的设备。需要直接从标准广播画面中提取此类信息，以实现更公平的数据驱动足球分析。

Method: 结合YOLO物体检测器与ByteTrack追踪算法，从单摄像头广播视频中识别和追踪球员、裁判、守门员和球。

Result: 系统在检测和追踪球员和裁判上表现良好，具有较高的精确率、召回率和mAP50分数，但球检测仍是主要的挑战。

Conclusion: AI可以从单摄像头广播画面中提取有意义的球员级空间信息，减少对专业硬件的依赖，使高校、青训学院和业余俱乐部能够采用之前只有职业队伍才能使用的可扩展数据驱动分析方法。

Abstract: Clubs with access to expensive multi-camera setups or GPS tracking systems gain a competitive advantage through detailed data, whereas lower-budget teams are often unable to collect similar information. This paper examines whether such data can instead be extracted directly from standard broadcast footage using a single-camera computer vision pipeline. This project develops an end-to-end system that combines a YOLO object detector with the ByteTrack tracking algorithm to identify and track players, referees, goalkeepers, and the ball throughout a match. Experimental results show that the pipeline achieves high performance in detecting and tracking players and officials, with strong precision, recall, and mAP50 scores, while ball detection remains the primary challenge. Despite this limitation, our findings demonstrate that AI can extract meaningful player-level spatial information from a single broadcast camera. By reducing reliance on specialized hardware, the proposed approach enables colleges, academies, and amateur clubs to adopt scalable, data-driven analysis methods previously accessible only to professional teams, highlighting the potential for affordable computer vision-based soccer analytics.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As pretrained models are increasingly shared on the web, ensuring that models can forget or delete sensitive, copyrighted, or private information upon request has become crucial. Machine unlearning has been proposed to address this challenge. However, current evaluations for unlearning methods rely on output-based metrics, which cannot verify whether information is completely deleted or merely suppressed at the representation level, where suppression is insufficient for true unlearning. To address this gap, we propose a novel restoration-based analysis framework that uses Sparse Autoencoders to identify class-specific expert features in intermediate layers and applies inference-time steering to quantitatively distinguish between suppression and deletion. Applying our framework to 12 major unlearning methods in image classification tasks, we find that most methods achieve high restoration rates of unlearned information, indicating that they only suppress information at the decision-boundary level, while preserving semantic features in intermediate representations. Notably, even retraining from pretrained checkpoints shows high restoration, revealing that robust semantic features inherited from pretraining are not removed by retraining. These results demonstrate that representation-level retention poses significant risks overlooked by output-based metrics, highlighting the need for new unlearning evaluation criteria. We propose new evaluation guidelines that prioritize representation-level verification, especially for privacy-critical applications in the era of pre-trained models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Though there exists a reasonable forward model for blur based on optical physics, recovering depth from a collection of defocused images remains a computationally challenging optimization problem. In this paper, we show that with contemporary optimization methods and reasonable computing resources, a global optimization approach to depth from defocus is feasible. Our approach rests on alternating minimization. When holding the depth map fixed, the forward model is linear with respect to the all-in-focus image. When holding the all-in-focus image fixed, the depth at each pixel can be computed independently, enabling embarrassingly parallel computation. We show that alternating between convex optimization and parallel grid search can effectively solve the depth-from-defocus problem at higher resolutions than current deep learning methods. We demonstrate our approach on benchmark datasets with synthetic and real defocus blur and show promising results compared to prior approaches. Our code is available at github.com/hollyjackson/dfd.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Providing timely, rubric-aligned feedback on student-drawn diagrams is a persistent challenge in STEM education. While large multimodal models (LMMs) can jointly parse images and generate explanations, their tendency to hallucinate undermines trust in classroom deployments. We present Sketch2Feedback, a grammar-in-the-loop framework that decomposes the problem into four stages -- hybrid perception, symbolic graph construction, constraint checking, and constrained VLM feedback -- so that the language model verbalizes only violations verified by an upstream rule engine. We evaluate on two synthetic micro-benchmarks, FBD-10 (free-body diagrams) and Circuit-10 (circuit schematics), each with 500 images spanning standard and hard noise augmentation tiers, comparing our pipeline against end-to-end LMMs (LLaVA-1.5-7B, Qwen2-VL-7B), a vision-only detector, a YOLOv8-nano learned detector, and an ensemble oracle. On n=100 test samples per benchmark with 95% bootstrap CIs, results are mixed and instructive: Qwen2-VL-7B achieves the highest micro-F1 on both FBDs (0.570) and circuits (0.528), but with extreme hallucination rates (0.78, 0.98). An ensemble oracle that selects the best prediction per sample reaches F1=0.556 with hallucination 0.320 on FBDs, demonstrating exploitable complementarity between grammar and end-to-end approaches. Confidence thresholding at tau=0.7 reduces circuit hallucination from 0.970 to 0.880 with no F1 loss. Hard noise augmentation reveals domain-dependent robustness: FBD detection is resilient while circuit detection degrades sharply. An LLM-as-judge evaluation confirms that the grammar pipeline produces more actionable circuit feedback (4.85/5) than the end-to-end LMM (3.11/5). We release all code, datasets, and evaluation scripts.

### [8] [Do Generative Metrics Predict YOLO Performance? An Evaluation Across Models, Augmentation Ratios, and Dataset Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18525)
*Vasile Marian,Yong-Bin Kang,Alexander Buddery*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了合成图像对YOLOv11目标检测性能的影响，通过三个数据集和六种生成器的对比实验，发现合成数据增强在复杂场景下效果显著，但在简单场景或预训练模型中效果有限，且传统生成指标与下游检测性能的相关性高度依赖于具体场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前合成图像已被广泛用于扩充目标检测训练集，但如何在训练前可靠评估合成数据集的质量仍是一个难题。标准的全局生成度量（如FID）通常无法预测下游检测性能（mAP）。

Method: 1）在三个单类别检测场景中进行控制性评估：交通标志（稀疏/近饱和）、Cityscapes行人（密集/遮挡多）和COCO盆栽植物（多实例/高变异性）。2）使用六种GAN、扩散和混合生成器进行测试，增强比例为真实训练数据的10%-150%。3）采用匹配规模的自举协议计算预训练数据集度量，包括Inception-v3和DINOv2嵌入的全局特征空间度量，以及边界框统计的对象中心分布距离。

Result: 1）合成增强在更复杂的场景中效果显著（行人和盆栽植物的相对mAP分别提升+7.6%和+30.6%），但在交通标志场景和预训练微调中效果有限。2）在控制了增强量后，发现许多原始关联性减弱，说明度量与性能的对齐度高度依赖于具体场景。

Conclusion: 合成数据增强在不同检测场景下效果差异明显，传统的生成度量指标与下游检测性能相关性具有场景依赖性。研究强调了在设计合成评估协议时需要考虑具体的检测场景特性，并建议使用增强控制的分析方法来分离数量效应与质量效应。

Abstract: Synthetic images are increasingly used to augment object-detection training sets, but reliably evaluating a synthetic dataset before training remains difficult: standard global generative metrics (e.g., FID) often do not predict downstream detection mAP. We present a controlled evaluation of synthetic augmentation for YOLOv11 across three single-class detection regimes -- Traffic Signs (sparse/near-saturated), Cityscapes Pedestrian (dense/occlusion-heavy), and COCO PottedPlant (multi-instance/high-variability). We benchmark six GAN-, diffusion-, and hybrid-based generators over augmentation ratios from 10% to 150% of the real training split, and train YOLOv11 both from scratch and with COCO-pretrained initialization, evaluating on held-out real test splits (mAP@0.50:0.95). For each dataset-generator-augmentation configuration, we compute pre-training dataset metrics under a matched-size bootstrap protocol, including (i) global feature-space metrics in both Inception-v3 and DINOv2 embeddings and (ii) object-centric distribution distances over bounding-box statistics. Synthetic augmentation yields substantial gains in the more challenging regimes (up to +7.6% and +30.6% relative mAP in Pedestrian and PottedPlant, respectively) but is marginal in Traffic Signs and under pretrained fine-tuning. To separate metric signal from augmentation quantity, we report both raw and augmentation-controlled (residualized) correlations with multiple-testing correction, showing that metric-performance alignment is strongly regime-dependent and that many apparent raw associations weaken after controlling for augmentation level.

Abstract: Current audio-visual large language models (AV-LLMs) are predominantly restricted to 2D perception, relying on RGB video and monaural audio. This design choice introduces a fundamental dimensionality mismatch that precludes reliable source localization and spatial reasoning in complex 3D environments. We address this limitation by presenting JAEGER, a framework that extends AV-LLMs to 3D space, to enable joint spatial grounding and reasoning through the integration of RGB-D observations and multi-channel first-order ambisonics. A core contribution of our work is the neural intensity vector (Neural IV), a learned spatial audio representation that encodes robust directional cues to enhance direction-of-arrival estimation, even in adverse acoustic scenarios with overlapping sources. To facilitate large-scale training and systematic evaluation, we propose SpatialSceneQA, a benchmark of 61k instruction-tuning samples curated from simulated physical environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses 2D-centric baselines across diverse spatial perception and reasoning tasks, underscoring the necessity of explicit 3D modelling for advancing AI in physical environments. Our source code, pre-trained model checkpoints and datasets will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 提出了一个深度增强的YOLO-SAM2框架，利用RGB-D数据进行铁路道床不足检测，通过深度校正和分割改进识别可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的YOLOv8虽然定位可靠，但基于RGB的模型在安全性能上有限，特别是在道床不足检测中召回率低，存在误判风险。

Method: 结合深度几何分析和轨枕对齐的深度校正流程，使用多项式建模、RANSAC和时间平滑补偿空间畸变，SAM2分割进一步优化感兴趣区域掩码。

Result: 在实地采集的RGB-D数据上，深度增强配置显著提升道床不足检测性能，召回率达到0.80，F1值超过0.80，较RGB-only模型有显著改善。

Conclusion: 深度校正与YOLO-SAM2的结合提供了更鲁棒可靠的铁路道床自动化检测方法，特别是在视觉模糊或安全关键场景中效果显著。

Abstract: This paper presents a depth-enhanced YOLO-SAM2 framework for detecting ballast insufficiency in railway tracks using RGB-D data. Although YOLOv8 provides reliable localization, the RGB-only model shows limited safety performance, achieving high precision (0.99) but low recall (0.49) due to insufficient ballast, as it tends to over-predict the sufficient class. To improve reliability, we incorporate depth-based geometric analysis enabled by a sleeper-aligned depth-correction pipeline that compensates for RealSense spatial distortion using polynomial modeling, RANSAC, and temporal smoothing. SAM2 segmentation further refines region-of-interest masks, enabling accurate extraction of sleeper and ballast profiles for geometric classification.
  Experiments on field-collected top-down RGB-D data show that depth-enhanced configurations substantially improve the detection of insufficient ballast. Depending on bounding-box sampling (AABB or RBB) and geometric criteria, recall increases from 0.49 to as high as 0.80, and F1-score improves from 0.66 to over 0.80. These results demonstrate that integrating depth correction with YOLO-SAM2 yields a more robust and reliable approach for automated railway ballast inspection, particularly in visually ambiguous or safety-critical scenarios.

Abstract: This study compares multiple deep learning architectures for the automated, image-based classification of five locally cultivated black table olive varieties in Turkey: Gemlik, Ayvalik, Uslu, Erkence, and Celebi. Using a dataset of 2500 images, ten architectures - MobileNetV2, EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetV2-S, ResNet50, ResNet101, DenseNet121, InceptionV3, ConvNeXt-Tiny, ViT-B16, and Swin-T - were trained using transfer learning. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC), Cohen's Kappa, ROC-AUC, number of parameters, FLOPs, inference time, and generalization gap. EfficientNetV2-S achieved the highest classification accuracy (95.8%), while EfficientNetB0 provided the best trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity. Overall, the results indicate that under limited data conditions, parametric efficiency plays a more critical role than model depth alone.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Face presentation attack detection (FacePAD) is critical for securing facial authentication against print, replay, and mask-based spoofing. This paper proposes CASO-PAD, an RGB-only, single-frame model that enhances MobileNetV3 with content-adaptive spatial operators (involution) to better capture localized spoof cues. Unlike spatially shared convolution kernels, the proposed operator generates location-specific, channel-shared kernels conditioned on the input, improving spatial selectivity with minimal overhead. CASO-PAD remains lightweight (3.6M parameters; 0.64 GFLOPs at $256\times256$) and is trained end-to-end using a standard binary cross-entropy objective. Extensive experiments on Replay-Attack, Replay-Mobile, ROSE-Youtu, and OULU-NPU demonstrate strong performance, achieving 100/100/98.9/99.7\% test accuracy, AUC of 1.00/1.00/0.9995/0.9999, and HTER of 0.00/0.00/0.82/0.44\%, respectively. On the large-scale SiW-Mv2 Protocol-1 benchmark, CASO-PAD further attains 95.45\% accuracy with 3.11\% HTER and 3.13\% EER, indicating improved robustness under diverse real-world attacks. Ablation studies show that placing the adaptive operator near the network head and using moderate group sharing yields the best accuracy--efficiency balance. Overall, CASO-PAD provides a practical pathway for robust, on-device FacePAD with mobile-class compute and without auxiliary sensors or temporal stacks.

Abstract: Following the rise of large foundation models, Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) emerged, leveraging strong visual and language understanding for general-purpose policy learning. Yet, the current VLA landscape remains fragmented and exploratory. Although many groups have proposed their own VLA models, inconsistencies in training protocols and evaluation settings make it difficult to identify which design choices truly matter. To bring structure to this evolving space, we reexamine the VLA design space under a unified framework and evaluation setup. Starting from a simple VLA baseline similar to RT-2 and OpenVLA, we systematically dissect design choices along three dimensions: foundational components, perception essentials, and action modelling perspectives. From this study, we distill 12 key findings that together form a practical recipe for building strong VLA models. The outcome of this exploration is a simple yet effective model, VLANeXt. VLANeXt outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods on the LIBERO and LIBERO-plus benchmarks and demonstrates strong generalization in real-world experiments. We will release a unified, easy-to-use codebase that serves as a common platform for the community to reproduce our findings, explore the design space, and build new VLA variants on top of a shared foundation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We demonstrate that morphological pressure creates navigable gradients at multiple levels of the text-to-image generative pipeline. In Study~1, identity basins in Stable Diffusion 1.5 can be navigated using morphological descriptors -- constituent features like platinum blonde,'' beauty mark,'' and 1950s glamour'' -- without the target's name or photographs. A self-distillation loop (generating synthetic images from descriptor prompts, then training a LoRA on those outputs) achieves consistent convergence toward a specific identity as measured by ArcFace similarity. The trained LoRA creates a local coordinate system shaping not only the target identity but also its inverse: maximal away-conditioning produces eldritch'' structural breakdown in base SD1.5, while the LoRA-equipped model produces ``uncanny valley'' outputs -- coherent but precisely wrong. In Study~2, we extend this to prompt-level morphology. Drawing on phonestheme theory, we generate 200 novel nonsense words from English sound-symbolic clusters (e.g., \emph{cr-}, \emph{sn-}, \emph{-oid}, \emph{-ax}) and find that phonestheme-bearing candidates produce significantly more visually coherent outputs than random controls (mean Purity@1 = 0.371 vs.\ 0.209, p<0.00001p < 0.00001 p<0.00001, Cohen's d=0.55d = 0.55 d=0.55). Three candidates -- \emph{snudgeoid}, \emph{crashax}, and \emph{broomix} -- achieve perfect visual consistency (Purity@1 = 1.0) with zero training data contamination, each generating a distinct, coherent visual identity from phonesthetic structure alone. Together, these studies establish that morphological structure -- whether in feature descriptors or prompt-level phonological form -- creates systematic navigational gradients through diffusion model latent spaces. We document phase transitions in identity basins, CFG-invariant identity stability, and novel visual concepts emerging from sub-lexical sound patterns.

Abstract: The dependence on expert annotation has long constituted the primary rate-limiting step in the application of artificial intelligence to biomedicine. While supervised learning drove the initial wave of clinical algorithms, a paradigm shift towards unsupervised and self-supervised learning (SSL) is currently unlocking the latent potential of biobank-scale datasets. By learning directly from the intrinsic structure of data - whether pixels in a magnetic resonance image (MRI), voxels in a volumetric scan, or tokens in a genomic sequence - these methods facilitate the discovery of novel phenotypes, the linkage of morphology to genetics, and the detection of anomalies without human bias. This article synthesises seminal and recent advances in "learning without labels," highlighting how unsupervised frameworks can derive heritable cardiac traits, predict spatial gene expression in histology, and detect pathologies with performance that rivals or exceeds supervised counterparts.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Rodent-Bench基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)在啮齿动物行为视频标注上的能力，发现现有主流模型在该任务上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏专门针对科学视频标注任务的多模态大语言模型评估基准，尤其是啮齿动物行为分析这一神经科学研究中的重要应用领域需要可靠的自动化标注工具。

Method: 1)创建Rodent-Bench基准，包含多种行为范式(社交互动、梳理、挠痒、冻结行为)的数据集，视频长度10-35分钟
2)提供两个版本以适应不同模型能力
3)使用秒级准确率、宏观F1、平均精度均值、互信息和马修斯相关系数等标准化指标
4)评估Gemini-2.5-Pro、Gemini-2.5-Flash和Qwen-VL-Max等SOTA MLLMs

Result: 1)所有评估模型在该任务上表现均不够强劲，无法作为有效助手
2)某些模型在特定数据集(如梳理检测)上表现尚可
3)模型在时间分割、处理长视频序列和区分细微行为状态方面存在显著挑战

Conclusion: 当前MLLMs在科学视频标注方面存在关键局限性，Rodent-Bench为追踪神经科学研究中可靠自动化行为标注的进展提供了基础，并为未来模型发展指明了方向。

Abstract: We present Rodent-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to annotate rodent behaviour footage. We evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs, including Gemini-2.5-Pro, Gemini-2.5-Flash and Qwen-VL-Max, using this benchmark and find that none of these models perform strongly enough to be used as an assistant for this task. Our benchmark encompasses diverse datasets spanning multiple behavioral paradigms including social interactions, grooming, scratching, and freezing behaviors, with videos ranging from 10 minutes to 35 minutes in length. We provide two benchmark versions to accommodate varying model capabilities and establish standardized evaluation metrics including second-wise accuracy, macro F1, mean average precision, mutual information, and Matthew's correlation coefficient. While some models show modest performance on certain datasets (notably grooming detection), overall results reveal significant challenges in temporal segmentation, handling extended video sequences, and distinguishing subtle behavioral states. Our analysis identifies key limitations in current MLLMs for scientific video annotation and provides insights for future model development. Rodent-Bench serves as a foundation for tracking progress toward reliable automated behavioral annotation in neuroscience research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 花朵的精确定位和识别对于推进自动化农业至关重要，特别是在植物表型分析、作物估算和产量监测中。当前需要评估不同目标检测模型在花朵检测任务中的性能，特别是在密集和稀疏两种不同场景下的表现差异。

Abstract: Precise localization and recognition of flowers are crucial for advancing automated agriculture, particularly in plant phenotyping, crop estimation, and yield monitoring. This paper benchmarks several YOLO architectures such as YOLOv5s, YOLOv8n/s/m, and YOLOv12n for flower object detection under two annotation regimes: single-image single-bounding box (SISBB) and single-image multiple-bounding box (SIMBB). The FloralSix dataset, comprising 2,816 high-resolution photos of six different flower species, is also introduced. It is annotated for both dense (clustered) and sparse (isolated) scenarios. The models were evaluated using Precision, Recall, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) at IoU thresholds of 0.5 (mAP@0.5) and 0.5-0.95 (mAP@0.5:0.95). In SISBB, YOLOv8m (SGD) achieved the best results with Precision 0.956, Recall 0.951, mAP@0.5 0.978, and mAP@0.5:0.95 0.865, illustrating strong accuracy in detecting isolated flowers. With mAP@0.5 0.934 and mAP@0.5:0.95 0.752, YOLOv12n (SGD) outperformed the more complicated SIMBB scenario, proving robustness in dense, multi-object detection. Results show how annotation density, IoU thresholds, and model size interact: recall-optimized models perform better in crowded environments, whereas precision-oriented models perform best in sparse scenarios. In both cases, the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer consistently performed better than alternatives. These density-sensitive sensors are helpful for non-destructive crop analysis, growth tracking, robotic pollination, and stress evaluation.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) and their variants have become state-of-the-art in many computer vision tasks and are widely used as backbones in large-scale vision and vision-language foundation models. While substantial research has focused on architectural improvements, the impact of patch size, a crucial initial design choice in ViTs, remains underexplored, particularly in medical domains where both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) imaging modalities exist.
  In this study, using 12 medical imaging datasets from various imaging modalities (including seven 2D and five 3D datasets), we conduct a thorough evaluation of how different patch sizes affect ViT classification performance. Using a single graphical processing unit (GPU) and a range of patch sizes (1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28), we fine-tune ViT models and observe consistent improvements in classification performance with smaller patch sizes (1, 2, and 4), which achieve the best results across nearly all datasets. More specifically, our results indicate improvements in balanced accuracy of up to 12.78% for 2D datasets (patch size 2 vs. 28) and up to 23.78% for 3D datasets (patch size 1 vs. 14), at the cost of increased computational expense. Moreover, by applying a straightforward ensemble strategy that fuses the predictions of the models trained with patch sizes 1, 2, and 4, we demonstrate a further boost in performance in most cases, especially for the 2D datasets. Our implementation is publicly available on GitHub: https://github.com/HealMaDe/MedViT

Abstract: We present a novel approach for generating realistic speaking and talking faces by synthesizing a person's voice and facial movements from a static image, a voice profile, and a target text. The model encodes the prompt/driving text, the driving image, and the voice profile of an individual and then combines them to pass them to the multi-entangled latent space to foster key-value pairs and queries for the audio and video modality generation pipeline. The multi-entangled latent space is responsible for establishing the spatiotemporal person-specific features between the modalities. Further, entangled features are passed to the respective decoder of each modality for output audio and video generation.

Abstract: Long video understanding is challenging due to rich and complicated multimodal clues in long temporal range.Current methods adopt reasoning to improve the model's ability to analyze complex video clues in long videos via text-form reasoning.However,the existing literature suffers from the fact that the text-only reasoning under fixed video context may exacerbate hallucinations since detailed crucial clues are often ignored under limited video context length due to the temporal redundancy of long videos.To address this gap,we propose Video-TwG,a curriculum reinforced framework that employs a novel Think-with-Grounding paradigm,enabling video LLMs to actively decide when to perform on-demand grounding during interleaved text-video reasoning, selectively zooming into question-relevant clips only when necessary.Video-TwG can be trained end-to-end in a straightforward manner, without relying on complex auxiliary modules or heavily annotated reasoning tracesIn detail,we design a Two-stage Reinforced Curriculum Strategy, where the model first learns think-with-grounding behavior on a small short-video GQA dataset with grounding labels,and then scales to diverse general QA data with videos of diverse domains to encourage generalization. Further, to handle complex think-with-grounding reasoning for various kinds of data,we propose TwG-GRPO algorithm which features the fine-grained grounding reward, self-confirmed pseudo reward and accuracy-gated mechanism.Finally,we propose to construct a new TwG-51K dataset that facilitates training. Experiments on Video-MME, LongVideoBench, and MLVU show that Video-TwG consistently outperforms strong LVU baselines.Further ablation validates the necessity of our Two-stage Reinforced Curriculum Strategy and shows our TwG-GRPO better leverages diverse unlabeled data to improve grounding quality and reduce redundant groundings without sacrificing QA performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的几何基础模型在密集几何SLAM方面有显著进展，但往往缺乏深度语义理解和鲁棒的回环闭合能力。同时，当代语义建图方法常受限于解耦架构和脆弱的数据关联机制。

Method: 通过扩展几何基础模型，使其能同时预测密集几何和跨视角一致的实例嵌入，从而启用语义协同关联机制和实例引导的回环检测。利用视角无关的语义锚点来弥合几何重建与开放词汇建图之间的差距。

Result: 实验结果表明，IRIS-SLAM在地图一致性和宽基线回环闭合可靠性方面显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: IRIS-SLAM利用统一几何-实例表示解决了现有SLAM系统的语义理解和回环检测不足问题，在语义SLAM任务中展现出卓越性能。

Abstract: Geometry foundation models have significantly advanced dense geometric SLAM, yet existing systems often lack deep semantic understanding and robust loop closure capabilities. Meanwhile, contemporary semantic mapping approaches are frequently hindered by decoupled architectures and fragile data association. We propose IRIS-SLAM, a novel RGB semantic SLAM system that leverages unified geometric-instance representations derived from an instance-extended foundation model. By extending a geometry foundation model to concurrently predict dense geometry and cross-view consistent instance embeddings, we enable a semantic-synergized association mechanism and instance-guided loop closure detection. Our approach effectively utilizes viewpoint-agnostic semantic anchors to bridge the gap between geometric reconstruction and open-vocabulary mapping. Experimental results demonstrate that IRIS-SLAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in map consistency and wide-baseline loop closure reliability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文揭示了多种LVLM解码器在物体幻觉问题上的层敏感性差异，并提出了Hallucination Insensitivity Score（HIS）来量化层敏感性，进而基于HIS开发了Hallucination Insensitivity Model Editing（HIME）方法，在不增加计算成本下大幅降低幻觉发生率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LVLM在表现出出色的多模态理解能力的同时，容易产生物体幻觉（描述不存在的物体或赋予错误事实信息），这对其实际部署的可靠性构成严重担忧。尽管微调是一种常见缓解策略，但其高计算成本和实际困难催生了训练免费替代方案的需求。模型编辑是其中一种前景方向，但无差别编辑可能破坏预训练LVLM中丰富的隐含知识，因此需要探索在每个层进行干预的程度以在抑制幻觉的同时保留预训练知识。

Method: 首先对基于三种主流大语言模型骨干（Qwen、LLaMA 和 Vicuna）的LVLM解码器进行系统分析，揭示了层敏感性差异。基于此提出Hallucination Insensitivity Score（HIS），这是一种量化层对幻觉敏感性的度量指标，为目标干预提供指导。利用HIS，提出Hallucination Insensitivity Model Editing（HIME），一种简单有效的层自适应权重编辑方法，通过选择性修改潜在特征在保留预训练知识的同时抑制幻觉。

Result: 大量实验表明，在开放生成评测基准（包括CHAIR、MME和GPT-4V辅助评估）上，HIME平均将幻觉减少了61.8%，且未引入额外参数、推理延迟或计算开销。

Conclusion: 本研究系统分析了LVLM解码器层对幻觉的敏感性，并提出HIS和HIME方法，HIME作为一种简单的层自适应权重编辑方法，在不增加计算成本的情况下，能有效抑制物体幻觉，同时保留预训练知识，推动了LVLM可靠性提升的研究。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive multimodal understanding capabilities, yet they remain prone to object hallucination, where models describe non-existent objects or attribute incorrect factual information, raising serious concerns for reliable real-world deployment. While fine-tuning is a commonly adopted mitigation strategy, its high computational cost and practical difficulty motivate the need for training-free alternatives, among which model editing has recently emerged as a promising direction. However, indiscriminate editing risks disrupting the rich implicit knowledge encoded in pre-trained LVLMs, leading to a fundamental question: how much intervention is necessary at each layer to suppress hallucinations while preserving pre-trained knowledge? To address this question, we present a systematic analysis of LVLM decoders built on three widely used large language model backbones-Qwen, LLaMA, and Vicuna-revealing clear layer-wise differences in susceptibility to object hallucination. Building on these insights, we introduce the Hallucination Insensitivity Score (HIS), a principled metric that quantifies each layer's sensitivity to hallucination and provides guidance for targeted intervention. Leveraging HIS, we propose Hallucination Insensitivity Model Editing (HIME), a simple yet effective layer-adaptive weight editing approach that selectively modifies latent features to suppress hallucinations while preserving pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HIME reduces hallucinations by an average of 61.8% across open-ended generation benchmarks, including CHAIR, MME, and GPT-4V-aided evaluation, without introducing additional parameters, inference-time latency, or computational overhead.

TL;DR: WiCompass：面向毫米波人体姿态估计的数据收集框架，通过覆盖感知提升分布外鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波人体姿态估计虽具隐私优势，但在分布偏移下泛化能力差。现有方法依赖海量数据扩展，但对分布外（OOD）鲁棒性提升有限，数据收集的效率和覆盖度才是关键瓶颈。

Method: 提出WiCompass覆盖感知数据收集框架：1）利用大规模运动捕捉数据集构建通用姿态空间「先知」，量化数据集冗余度；2）识别被低估的（underrepresented）动作模式；3）基于先知指导，采用闭环策略优先采集信息量高的缺失样本。

Result: 实验表明，WiCompass在等同预算下能持续提升OOD精度，且相较于传统收集策略展现出更优的扩展（scaling）表现。

Conclusion: 本工作将关注点从暴力数据扩展转向覆盖感知的数据获取，为构建鲁棒的毫米波感知系统提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Millimeter-wave Human Pose Estimation (mmWave HPE) promises privacy but suffers from poor generalization under distribution shifts. We demonstrate that brute-force data scaling is ineffective for out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness; efficiency and coverage are the true bottlenecks. To address this, we introduce WiCompass, a coverage-aware data-collection framework. WiCompass leverages large-scale motion-capture corpora to build a universal pose space ``oracle'' that quantifies dataset redundancy and identifies underrepresented motions. Guided by this oracle, WiCompass employs a closed-loop policy to prioritize collecting informative missing samples. Experiments show that WiCompass consistently improves OOD accuracy at matched budgets and exhibits superior scaling behavior compared to conventional collection strategies. By shifting focus from brute-force scaling to coverage-aware data acquisition, this work offers a practical path toward robust mmWave sensing.

Abstract: Fine-grained image-caption alignment is crucial for vision-language models (VLMs), especially in socially critical contexts such as identifying real-world risk scenarios or distinguishing cultural proxies, where correct interpretation hinges on subtle visual or linguistic clues and where minor misinterpretations can lead to significant real-world consequences. We present MiSCHiEF, a set of two benchmarking datasets based on a contrastive pair design in the domains of safety (MiS) and culture (MiC), and evaluate four VLMs on tasks requiring fine-grained differentiation of paired images and captions. In both datasets, each sample contains two minimally differing captions and corresponding minimally differing images. In MiS, the image-caption pairs depict a safe and an unsafe scenario, while in MiC, they depict cultural proxies in two distinct cultural contexts. We find that models generally perform better at confirming the correct image-caption pair than rejecting incorrect ones. Additionally, models achieve higher accuracy when selecting the correct caption from two highly similar captions for a given image, compared to the converse task. The results, overall, highlight persistent modality misalignment challenges in current VLMs, underscoring the difficulty of precise cross-modal grounding required for applications with subtle semantic and visual distinctions.

Second, our framework is training-free and compatible with different 3D foundation models. Third, we introduce Omni-Comp, a comprehensive benchmark combining real-world and synthetic data with diverse and challenging partial patterns, enabling a more thorough and realistic evaluation. Both quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Multimodal geometry reasoning requires models to jointly understand visual diagrams and perform structured symbolic inference, yet current vision--language models struggle with complex geometric constructions due to limited training data and weak visual--symbolic alignment. We propose a pipeline for synthesizing complex multimodal geometry problems from scratch and construct a dataset named \textbf{GeoCode}, which decouples problem generation into symbolic seed construction, grounded instantiation with verification, and code-based diagram rendering, ensuring consistency across structure, text, reasoning, and images. Leveraging the plotting code provided in GeoCode, we further introduce code prediction as an explicit alignment objective, transforming visual understanding into a supervised structured prediction task. GeoCode exhibits substantially higher structural complexity and reasoning difficulty than existing benchmarks, while maintaining mathematical correctness through multi-stage validation. Extensive experiments show that models trained on GeoCode achieve consistent improvements on multiple geometry benchmarks, demonstrating both the effectiveness of the dataset and the proposed alignment strategy. The code will be available at https://github.com/would1920/GeoCode.

Result: 在通用和推理型视觉语言基准测试中，MIRROR提高正确性并减少视觉幻觉，优于纯文本修订方法

Conclusion: 将反思训练为基于证据寻求和区域感知的验证过程而非纯文本修订步骤具有重要价值

Abstract: In the era of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), enhancing multimodal reasoning capabilities remains a critical challenge, particularly in handling ambiguous or complex visual inputs, where initial inferences often lead to hallucinations or logic errors. Existing VLMs often produce plausible yet ungrounded answers, and even when prompted to "reflect", their corrections may remain detached from the image evidence. To address this, we propose the MIRROR framework for Multimodal Iterative Reasoning via Reflection On visual Regions. By embedding visual reflection as a core mechanism, MIRROR is formulated as a closed-loop process comprising draft, critique, region-based verification, and revision, which are repeated until the output is visually grounded. To facilitate training of this model, we construct **ReflectV**, a visual reflective dataset for multi-turn supervision that explicitly contains reflection triggers, region-based verification actions, and answer revision grounded in visual evidence. Experiments on both general vision-language benchmarks and representative vision-language reasoning benchmarks show that MIRROR improves correctness and reduces visual hallucinations, demonstrating the value of training reflection as an evidence-seeking, region-aware verification process rather than a purely textual revision step.

Conclusion: 基础模型集成（特别是CONCH、PathDino和CellViT的特征拼接）能够更好地泛化到多样化的组织病理学分割任务中，平均性能提升了7.95%

Abstract: In recent years, foundation models such as CLIP, DINO,and CONCH have demonstrated remarkable domain generalization and unsupervised feature extraction capabilities across diverse imaging tasks. However, systematic and independent evaluations of these models for pixel-level semantic segmentation in histopathology remain scarce. In this study, we propose a robust benchmarking approach to asses 10 foundational models on four histopathological datasets covering both morphological tissue-region and cellular/nuclear segmentation tasks. Our method leverages attention maps of foundation models as pixel-wise features, which are then classified using a machine learning algorithm, XGBoost, enabling fast, interpretable, and model-agnostic evaluation without finetuning. We show that the vision language foundation model, CONCH performed the best across datasets when compared to vision-only foundation models, with PathDino as close second. Further analysis shows that models trained on distinct histopathology cohorts capture complementary morphological representations, and concatenating their features yields superior segmentation performance. Concatenating features from CONCH, PathDino and CellViT outperformed individual models across all the datasets by 7.95% (averaged across the datasets), suggesting that ensembles of foundation models can better generalize to diverse histopathological segmentation tasks.

Conclusion: EditedID为多模态编辑大模型在真人编辑场景中的部署铺平了道路，代码已在GitHub开源。

Abstract: Multimodal editing large models have demonstrated powerful editing capabilities across diverse tasks. However, a persistent and long-standing limitation is the decline in facial identity (ID) consistency during realistic portrait editing. Due to the human eye's high sensitivity to facial features, such inconsistency significantly hinders the practical deployment of these models. Current facial ID preservation methods struggle to achieve consistent restoration of both facial identity and edited element IP due to Cross-source Distribution Bias and Cross-source Feature Contamination. To address these issues, we propose EditedID, an Alignment-Disentanglement-Entanglement framework for robust identity-specific facial restoration. By systematically analyzing diffusion trajectories, sampler behaviors, and attention properties, we introduce three key components: 1) Adaptive mixing strategy that aligns cross-source latent representations throughout the diffusion process. 2) Hybrid solver that disentangles source-specific identity attributes and details. 3) Attentional gating mechanism that selectively entangles visual elements. Extensive experiments show that EditedID achieves state-of-the-art performance in preserving original facial ID and edited element IP consistency. As a training-free and plug-and-play solution, it establishes a new benchmark for practical and reliable single/multi-person facial identity restoration in open-world settings, paving the way for the deployment of multimodal editing large models in real-person editing scenarios.

Abstract: Human driving behavior is inherently diverse, yet most end-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) systems learn a single average driving style, neglecting individual differences. Achieving personalized E2E-AD faces challenges across three levels: limited real-world datasets with individual-level annotations, a lack of quantitative metrics for evaluating personal driving styles, and the absence of algorithms that can learn stylized representations from users' trajectories. To address these gaps, we propose Person2Drive, a comprehensive personalized E2E-AD platform and benchmark. It includes an open-source, flexible data collection system that simulates realistic scenarios to generate scalable and diverse personalized driving datasets; style vector-based evaluation metrics with Maximum Mean Discrepancy and KL divergence to comprehensively quantify individual driving behaviors; and a personalized E2E-AD framework with a style reward model that efficiently adapts E2E models for safe and individualized driving. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Person2Drive enables fine-grained analysis, reproducible evaluation, and effective personalization in end-to-end autonomous driving. Our dataset and code will be released after acceptance.

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition (FER) is a fine-grained visual understanding task where reliable predictions require reasoning over localized and meaningful facial cues. Recent vision--language models (VLMs) enable natural language explanations for FER, but their reasoning is often ungrounded, producing fluent yet unverifiable rationales that are weakly tied to visual evidence and prone to hallucination, leading to poor robustness across different datasets. We propose TAG (Thinking with Action Unit Grounding), a vision--language framework that explicitly constrains multimodal reasoning to be supported by facial Action Units (AUs). TAG requires intermediate reasoning steps to be grounded in AU-related facial regions, yielding predictions accompanied by verifiable visual evidence. The model is trained via supervised fine-tuning on AU-grounded reasoning traces followed by reinforcement learning with an AU-aware reward that aligns predicted regions with external AU detectors. Evaluated on RAF-DB, FERPlus, and AffectNet, TAG consistently outperforms strong open-source and closed-source VLM baselines while simultaneously improving visual faithfulness. Ablation and preference studies further show that AU-grounded rewards stabilize reasoning and mitigate hallucination, demonstrating the importance of structured grounded intermediate representations for trustworthy multimodal reasoning in FER. The code will be available at https://github.com/would1920/FER_TAG .

TL;DR: 开发了一个高分辨率全国性城中村数据集GeoLink-UV，覆盖342个中国城市的城中村边界和位置，基于AI框架提升地图产品质量，揭示了中国城中村的空间分布特征和区域差异，支持城市可持续发展和SDG-11评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中国的城中村作为一种高密度非正规聚落形式，在城市快速发展中普遍存在，但以往缺乏全国统一、可靠的识别数据集，限制了相关城市治理和政策制定的科学基础。

Method: 结合多源地理空间数据（光学遥感图像、地理矢量数据），建立了一个基础模型驱动的制图框架，通过地理分层抽样从28个城市独立样本验证数据集精度，以提升泛化能力和产品质量。

Result: 生成首个高分辨率全国城中村数据集（GeoLink-UV），城中村平均占建成区面积的8%，在华南和华中地区聚集明显；建筑层面分析证实其普遍具有低层高密度特征，形态上存在区域差异。

Conclusion: GeoLink-UV数据集为大规模城市研究、非正规聚落监测和基于证据的城市更新规划提供了开放、验证过的地理空间基础，直接支持与可持续发展目标11（可持续城市和社区）相关的评估。

Abstract: Urban Villages (UVs) represent a distinctive form of high-density informal settlement embedded within China's rapidly urbanizing cities. Accurate identification of UVs is critical for urban governance, renewal, and sustainable development. But due to the pronounced heterogeneity and diversity of UVs across China's vast territory, a consistent and reliable nationwide dataset has been lacking. In this work, we present GeoLink-UV, a high-resolution nationwide UV mapping product that clearly delineates the locations and boundaries of UVs in 342 Chinese cities. The dataset is derived from multisource geospatial data, including optical remote sensing images and geo-vector data, and is generated through a foundation model-driven mapping framework designed to address the generalization issues and improve the product quality. A geographically stratified accuracy assessment based on independent samples from 28 cities confirms the reliability and scientific credibility of the nationwide dataset across heterogeneous urban contexts. Based on this nationwide product, we reveal substantial interregional disparities in UV prevalence and spatial configuration. On average, UV areas account for 8 % of built-up land, with marked clustering in central and south China. Building-level analysis further confirms a consistent low-rise, high-density development pattern of UVs nationwide, while highlighting regionally differentiated morphological characteristics. The GeoLink-UV dataset provides an open and systematically validated geospatial foundation for urban studies, informal settlement monitoring, and evidence-based urban renewal planning, and contributes directly to large-scale assessments aligned with Sustainable Development Goal 11. The GeoLink-UV dataset introduced in this article is freely available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18688062.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了名为Zero-Shot Multiple-Instance Learning (ZS-MIL)的方法，用于改善病理全切片图像分类中随机初始化线性分类器的性能，通过使用视觉语言模型的文本编码器类别嵌入作为分类层的起点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型（VLM）已能实现零样本的病理全切片图像分类，但在进行监督微调时，需要整合多示例学习（MIL）框架。传统的线性分类器随机初始化方法在少样本学习场景下性能受限，且可能低于零样本预测的表现，因此需要改进初始化方式。

Method: 提出ZS-MIL方法，利用VLM文本编码器生成的类别级嵌入（而非随机初始化）作为MIL框架中分类层的初始权重，从而计算样本袋级（即切片级）的概率。该方法在高效迁移学习（ETL）的少样本场景下进行评估。

Result: 通过多项实验表明，ZS-MIL相比于已知的权重初始化技术，在性能（如亚型预测准确性）和结果稳定性（变异性）方面均表现出更强的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ZS-MIL是一种有效的权重初始化策略，能够在少样本学习中提升病理全切片图像分类的性能和可靠性，为基于视觉语言模型的监督微调提供了更好的起点。

Abstract: Vision language models (VLM) pre-trained on datasets of histopathological image-caption pairs enabled zero-shot slide-level classification. The ability of VLM image encoders to extract discriminative features also opens the door for supervised fine-tuning for whole-slide image (WSI) classification, ideally using few labeled samples. Slide-level prediction frameworks require the incorporation of multiple instance learning (MIL) due to the gigapixel size of the WSI. Following patch-level feature extraction and aggregation, MIL frameworks rely on linear classifiers trained on top of the slide-level aggregated features. Classifier weight initialization has a large influence on Linear Probing performance in efficient transfer learning (ETL) approaches based on few-shot learning. In this work, we propose Zero-Shot Multiple-Instance Learning (ZS-MIL) to address the limitations of random classifier initialization that underperform zero-shot prediction in MIL problems. ZS-MIL uses the class-level embeddings of the VLM text encoder as the classification layer's starting point to compute each sample's bag-level probabilities. Through multiple experiments, we demonstrate the robustness of ZS-MIL compared to well-known weight initialization techniques both in terms of performance and variability in an ETL few-shot scenario for subtyping prediction.

Conclusion: MaskDiME为高效反事实解释提供了一个实用且可推广的解决方案，在速度、精度和通用性方面均表现出色。

Abstract: Visual counterfactual explanations aim to reveal the minimal semantic modifications that can alter a model's prediction, providing causal and interpretable insights into deep neural networks. However, existing diffusion-based counterfactual generation methods are often computationally expensive, slow to sample, and imprecise in localizing the modified regions. To address these limitations, we propose MaskDiME, a simple, fast, and effective diffusion framework that unifies semantic consistency and spatial precision through localized sampling. Our approach adaptively focuses on decision-relevant regions to achieve localized and semantically consistent counterfactual generation while preserving high image fidelity. Our training-free framework, MaskDiME, achieves over 30x faster inference than the baseline method and achieves comparable or state-of-the-art performance across five benchmark datasets spanning diverse visual domains, establishing a practical and generalizable solution for efficient counterfactual explanation.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模文本到图像扩散模型难以与细致的人类偏好对齐，直接偏好优化（DPO）存在泛化差距，需要更有效的方法在不重新训练基础模型的情况下改善对齐效果。

Method: 将偏好对齐视为分类器无引导问题，使用细调的偏好模型在采样时作为外部控制信号。进一步将偏好学习分解为在正负数据上分别训练的两个模块，推理时通过减去它们的预测形成对比性引导向量，按用户选择的强度缩放后添加到基础预测中。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion 1.5和Stable Diffusion XL上使用Pick-a-Pic v2和HPDv3数据集评估，均显示出定量和定性的一致提升。

Conclusion: 该方法通过对比性引导实现了更好的偏好对齐，增强了泛化能力，为用户提供了可控的偏好对齐信号，同时避免了重新训练基础模型。

Abstract: Aligning large-scale text-to-image diffusion models with nuanced human preferences remains challenging. While direct preference optimization (DPO) is simple and effective, large-scale finetuning often shows a generalization gap. We take inspiration from test-time guidance and cast preference alignment as classifier-free guidance (CFG): a finetuned preference model acts as an external control signal during sampling. Building on this view, we propose a simple method that improves alignment without retraining the base model. To further enhance generalization, we decouple preference learning into two modules trained on positive and negative data, respectively, and form a \emph{contrastive guidance} vector at inference by subtracting their predictions (positive minus negative), scaled by a user-chosen strength and added to the base prediction at each step. This yields a sharper and controllable alignment signal. We evaluate on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and Stable Diffusion XL with Pick-a-Pic v2 and HPDv3, showing consistent quantitative and qualitative gains.

Abstract: Cross-Domain Few-Shot Object Detection (CD-FSOD) aims to detect novel classes in unseen target domains given only a few labeled examples. While open-vocabulary detectors built on vision-language models (VLMs) transfer well, they depend almost entirely on text prompts, which encode domain-invariant semantics but miss domain-specific visual information needed for precise localization under few-shot supervision. We propose a dual-branch detector that Learns Multi-modal Prototypes, dubbed LMP, by coupling textual guidance with visual exemplars drawn from the target domain. A Visual Prototype Construction module aggregates class-level prototypes from support RoIs and dynamically generates hard-negative prototypes in query images via jittered boxes, capturing distractors and visually similar backgrounds. In the visual-guided branch, we inject these prototypes into the detection pipeline with components mirrored from the text branch as the starting point for training, while a parallel text-guided branch preserves open-vocabulary semantics. The branches are trained jointly and ensembled at inference by combining semantic abstraction with domain-adaptive details. On six cross-domain benchmark datasets and standard 1/5/10-shot settings, our method achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive mAP.

Abstract: We study cross-modal super-resolution (SR) on real-world misaligned data, where only a limited number of low-resolution (LR) source and high-resolution (HR) guide image pairs with complex spatial misalignments are available. To address this challenge, we propose RobSelf--a fully self-supervised model that is optimized online, requiring no training data, ground-truth supervision, or pre-alignment. RobSelf features two key techniques: a misalignment-aware feature translator and a content-aware reference filter. The translator reformulates unsupervised cross-modal and cross-resolution alignment as a weakly-supervised, misalignment-aware translation subtask, producing an aligned guide feature with inherent redundancy. Guided by this feature, the filter performs reference-based discriminative self-enhancement on the source, enabling SR predictions with high resolution and high fidelity. Across a variety of tasks, we demonstrate that RobSelf achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior efficiency. Additionally, we introduce a real-world dataset, RealMisSR, to advance research on this topic. Dataset and code: https://github.com/palmdong/RobSelf.

Motivation: 现有基于扩散的方法在生成4D对象时难以保持时空一致性，因为它们未能利用所有先前时间步的输出指导当前时间步的生成

Method: 提出4DSTAR模型：1)动态空间-时间状态传播自回归模型(STAR)，按时间步分组预测，通过空间-时间容器传播历史状态特征指导生成；2)4D VQ-VAE将4D结构编码为离散空间，将STAR预测的token解码为时间一致的动态3D高斯模型

Result: 实验表明4DSTAR能够生成时空一致的4D对象，性能与扩散模型相当

Conclusion: 4DSTAR通过空间-时间状态传播机制有效解决了4D对象生成的时空一致性问题，为高质量4D内容生成提供了新方法

Abstract: Generating high-quality 4D objects with spatial-temporal consistency is still formidable. Existing diffusion-based methods often struggle with spatial-temporal inconsistency, as they fail to leverage outputs from all previous timesteps to guide the generation at the current timestep. Therefore, we propose a Spatial-Temporal State Propagation AutoRegressive Model (4DSTAR), which generates 4D objects maintaining temporal-spatial consistency. 4DSTAR formulates the generation problem as the prediction of tokens that represent the 4D object. It consists of two key components: (1) The dynamic spatial-temporal state propagation autoregressive model (STAR) is proposed, which achieves spatial-temporal consistent generation. Unlike standard autoregressive models, STAR divides prediction tokens into groups based on timesteps. It models long-term dependencies by propagating spatial-temporal states from previous groups and utilizes these dependencies to guide generation at the next timestep. To this end, a spatial-temporal container is proposed, which dynamically updating the effective spatial-temporal state features from all historical groups, then updated features serve as conditional features to guide the prediction of the next token group. (2) The 4D VQ-VAE is proposed, which implicitly encodes the 4D structure into discrete space and decodes the discrete tokens predicted by STAR into temporally coherent dynamic 3D Gaussians. Experiments demonstrate that 4DSTAR generates spatial-temporal consistent 4D objects, and achieves performance competitive with diffusion models.

Abstract: Synthetic data has emerged as a practical alternative to authentic face datasets for training face recognition (FR) systems, especially as privacy and legal concerns increasingly restrict the use of real biometric data. Recent advances in identity-conditional diffusion models have enabled the generation of photorealistic and identity-consistent face images. However, many of these models suffer from limited intra-class variation, an essential property for training robust and generalizable FR models. In this work, we propose IDPERTURB, a simple yet effective geometric-driven sampling strategy to enhance diversity in synthetic face generation. IDPERTURB perturbs identity embeddings within a constrained angular region of the unit hyper-sphere, producing a diverse set of embeddings without modifying the underlying generative model. Each perturbed embedding serves as a conditioning vector for a pre-trained diffusion model, enabling the synthesis of visually varied yet identity-coherent face images suitable for training generalizable FR systems. Empirical results demonstrate that training FR on datasets generated using IDPERTURB yields improved performance across multiple FR benchmarks, compared to existing synthetic data generation approaches.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks have remarkably progressed the performance of distinguishing plant diseases, severity grading, and nutrition deficiency prediction using leaf images. However, these tasks become more challenging in a realistic in-situ field condition. Often, a traditional machine learning model may fail to capture and interpret discriminative characteristics of plant health, growth and diseases due to subtle variations within leaf subcategories. A few deep learning methods have used additional preprocessing stages or network modules to address the problem, whereas several other methods have utilized pre-trained backbone CNNs, most of which are computationally intensive. Therefore, to address the challenge, we propose a lightweight autoencoder using separable convolutional layers in its encoder decoder blocks. A sigmoid gating is applied for refining the prowess of the encoders feature discriminability, which is improved further by the decoder. Finally, the feature maps of the encoder decoder are combined for rich feature representation before classification. The proposed Convolutional Lightweight Autoencoder for Plant disease classification, called CLAP, has been experimented on three public plant datasets consisting of cassava, tomato, maize, groundnut, grapes, etc. for determining plant health conditions. The CLAP has attained improved or competitive accuracies on the Integrated Plant Disease, Groundnut, and CCMT datasets balancing a tradeoff between the performance, and little computational cost requiring 5 million parameters. The training time is 20 milliseconds and inference time is 1 ms per image.

Abstract: The proliferation of highly realistic AI-generated images poses critical challenges for digital forensics, demanding precise pixel-level localization of manipulated regions. Existing methods predominantly learn discriminative patterns of specific forgeries and often struggle with novel manipulations as editing techniques continue to evolve. We propose the Iterative Forgery Amplifier Network (IFA-Net), which shifts from learning "what is fake" to modeling "what is real". Grounded in the principle that all manipulations deviate from the natural image manifold, IFA-Net leverages a frozen Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pretrained on real images as a universal realness prior. Our framework operates through a two-stage closed-loop process: an initial Dual-Stream Segmentation Network (DSSN) fuses the original image with MAE reconstruction residuals for coarse localization, followed by a Task-Adaptive Prior Injection (TAPI) module that converts this coarse prediction into guiding prompts to steer the MAE decoder and amplify reconstruction failures in suspicious regions for precise refinement. Extensive experiments on four diffusion-based inpainting benchmarks show that IFA-Net achieves an average improvement of 6.5% in IoU and 8.1% in F1-score over the second-best method, while demonstrating strong generalization to traditional manipulation types.

Abstract: With the rapid deployment and widespread adoption of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), disputes regarding model version attribution and ownership have become increasingly frequent, raising significant concerns about intellectual property protection. In this paper, we propose a framework for generating copyright triggers for MLLMs, enabling model publishers to embed verifiable ownership information into the model. The goal is to construct trigger images that elicit ownership-related textual responses exclusively in fine-tuned derivatives of the original model, while remaining inert in other non-derivative models. Our method constructs a tracking trigger image by treating the image as a learnable tensor, performing adversarial optimization with dual-injection of ownership-relevant semantic information. The first injection is achieved by enforcing textual consistency between the output of an auxiliary MLLM and a predefined ownership-relevant target text; the consistency loss is backpropagated to inject this ownership-related information into the image. The second injection is performed at the semantic-level by minimizing the distance between the CLIP features of the image and those of the target text. Furthermore, we introduce an additional adversarial training stage involving the auxiliary model derived from the original model itself. This auxiliary model is specifically trained to resist generating ownership-relevant target text, thereby enhancing robustness in heavily fine-tuned derivative models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our dual-injection approach in tracking model lineage under various fine-tuning and domain-shift scenarios.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable multimodal understanding and reasoning capabilities, yet remain computationally expensive due to dense visual tokenization. Existing efficiency approaches either merge redundant visual tokens or drop them progressively in language backbone, often trading accuracy for speed. In this work, we propose DUET-VLM, a versatile plug-and-play dual compression framework that consists of (a) vision-only redundancy aware compression of vision encoder's output into information-preserving tokens, followed by (b) layer-wise, salient text-guided dropping of visual tokens within the language backbone to progressively prune less informative tokens. This coordinated token management enables aggressive compression while retaining critical semantics. On LLaVA-1.5-7B, our approach maintains over 99% of baseline accuracy with 67% fewer tokens, and still retains >97% even at 89% reduction. With this dual-stage compression during training, it achieves 99.7% accuracy at 67% and 97.6% at 89%, surpassing prior SoTA visual token reduction methods across multiple benchmarks. When integrated into Video-LLaVA-7B, it even surpasses the baseline -- achieving >100% accuracy with a substantial 53.1% token reduction and retaining 97.6% accuracy under an extreme 93.4% setting.

Abstract: Domain Generalization in Semantic Segmentation (DG-SS) aims to enable segmentation models to perform robustly in unseen environments. However, conventional DG-SS methods are restricted to a fixed set of known categories, limiting their applicability in open-world scenarios. Recent progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has advanced Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OV-SS) by enabling models to recognize a broader range of concepts. Yet, these models remain sensitive to domain shifts and struggle to maintain robustness when deployed in unseen environments, a challenge that is particularly severe in urban-driving scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Open-Vocabulary Domain Generalization in Semantic Segmentation (OVDG-SS), a new setting that jointly addresses unseen domains and unseen categories. We introduce the first benchmark for OVDG-SS in autonomous driving, addressing a previously unexplored problem and covering both synthetic-to-real and real-to-real generalization across diverse unseen domains and unseen categories. In OVDG-SS, we observe that domain shifts often distort text-image correlations in pre-trained VLMs, which hinders the performance of OV-SS models. To tackle this challenge, we propose S2-Corr, a state-space-driven text-image correlation refinement mechanism that mitigates domain-induced distortions and produces more consistent text-image correlations under distribution changes. Extensive experiments on our constructed benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior cross-domain performance and efficiency compared to existing OV-SS approaches.

Abstract: We present a framework for end-to-end joint quantization of Vision Transformers trained on ImageNet for the purpose of image classification. Unlike prior post-training or block-wise reconstruction methods, we jointly optimize over the entire set of all layers and inter-block dependencies without any labeled data, scaling effectively with the number of samples and completing in just one hour on a single GPU for ViT-small. We achieve state-of-the-art W4A4 and W3A3 accuracies on ImageNet and, to the best of our knowledge, the first PTQ results that maintain strong accuracy on ViT, DeiT, and Swin-T models under extremely low-bit settings (W1.58A8), demonstrating the potential for efficient edge deployment. Furthermore, we introduce a data-free calibration strategy that synthesizes diverse, label-free samples using Stable Diffusion Turbo guided by learned multi-mode prompts. By encouraging diversity in both the learned prompt embeddings and the generated image features, our data-free approach achieves performance on par with real-data ImageNet calibration and surpasses simple text-prompt baselines such as "a <adjective> photo of <adjective> <cls>".

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of 3D LiDAR point clouds is important in urban remote sensing for understanding real-world street environments. This task, by projecting LiDAR point clouds and 3D semantic labels as sparse maps, can be reformulated as a 2D problem. However, the intrinsic sparsity of the projected LiDAR and label maps can result in sparse and inaccurate intermediate 2D semantic predictions, which in return limits the final 3D accuracy. To address this issue, we enhance this task by shaping dense and accurate 2D predictions. Specifically, we develop a multi-modal segmentation model, MM2D3D. By leveraging camera images as auxiliary data, we introduce cross-modal guided filtering to overcome label map sparsity by constraining intermediate 2D semantic predictions with dense semantic relations derived from the camera images; and we introduce dynamic cross pseudo supervision to overcome LiDAR map sparsity by encouraging the 2D predictions to emulate the dense distribution of the semantic predictions from the camera images. Experiments show that our techniques enable our model to achieve intermediate 2D semantic predictions with dense distribution and higher accuracy, which effectively enhances the final 3D accuracy. Comparisons with previous methods demonstrate our superior performance in both 2D and 3D spaces.

Abstract: Text-guided dynamic 3D character generation has advanced rapidly, yet producing high-quality motion that faithfully reflects rich textual descriptions remains challenging. Existing methods tend to generate limited sub-actions or incoherent motion due to fixed-length temporal inputs and discrete frame-wise representations that fail to capture rich motion semantics. We address these limitations by representing motion with continuous differentiable B-spline curves, enabling more effective motion generation without modifying the capabilities of the underlying generative model. Specifically, our closed-form, Laplacian-regularized B-spline solver efficiently compresses variable-length motion sequences into compact representations with a fixed number of control points. Further, we introduce a normal-fusion strategy for input shape adherence along with correspondence-aware and local-rigidity losses for motion-restoration quality. To train our model, we collate BIMO, a new dataset containing diverse variable-length 3D motion sequences with rich, high-quality text annotations. Extensive evaluations show that our feed-forward framework BiMotion generates more expressive, higher-quality, and better prompt-aligned motions than existing state-of-the-art methods, while also achieving faster generation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Few-shot Chinese font generation aims to synthesize new characters in a target style using only a handful of reference images. Achieving accurate content rendering and faithful style transfer requires effective disentanglement between content and style. However, existing approaches achieve only feature-level disentanglement, allowing the generator to re-entangle these features, leading to content distortion and degraded style fidelity. We propose the Structure-Level Disentangled Diffusion Model (SLD-Font), which receives content and style information from two separate channels. SimSun-style images are used as content templates and concatenated with noisy latent features as the input. Style features extracted by a CLIP model from target-style images are integrated via cross-attention. Additionally, we train a Background Noise Removal module in the pixel space to remove background noise in complex stroke regions. Based on theoretical validation of disentanglement effectiveness, we introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy that updates only the style-related modules. This allows the model to better adapt to new styles while avoiding overfitting to the reference images' content. We further introduce the Grey and OCR metrics to evaluate the content quality of generated characters. Experimental results show that SLD-Font achieves significantly higher style fidelity while maintaining comparable content accuracy to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Conclusion: FOCA通过跨域特征融合有效解决了现有图像篡改检测方法的局限，提高了检测性能和可解释性

Abstract: Advances in image tampering techniques, particularly generative models, pose significant challenges to media verification, digital forensics, and public trust. Existing image forgery detection and localization (IFDL) methods suffer from two key limitations: over-reliance on semantic content while neglecting textural cues, and limited interpretability of subtle low-level tampering traces. To address these issues, we propose FOCA, a multimodal large language model-based framework that integrates discriminative features from both the RGB spatial and frequency domains via a cross-attention fusion module. This design enables accurate forgery detection and localization while providing explicit, human-interpretable cross-domain explanations. We further introduce FSE-Set, a large-scale dataset with diverse authentic and tampered images, pixel-level masks, and dual-domain annotations. Extensive experiments show that FOCA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection performance and interpretability across both spatial and frequency domains.

Method: 提出多视角tokenizer将多个上下文视图编码为排列不变的token，使用轻量级整流流解码器进行新视角渲染

Result: 压缩比比其他表示高1-3个数量级，重建质量达SOTA；支持偏离输入轨迹的新视角渲染；5秒内完成高质量场景生成

Conclusion: SceneTok通过高度压缩的无序潜在token实现了高效、高质量的3D场景表示与生成，在质量与速度间达到更好平衡

Abstract: We present SceneTok, a novel tokenizer for encoding view sets of scenes into a compressed and diffusable set of unstructured tokens. Existing approaches for 3D scene representation and generation commonly use 3D data structures or view-aligned fields. In contrast, we introduce the first method that encodes scene information into a small set of permutation-invariant tokens that is disentangled from the spatial grid. The scene tokens are predicted by a multi-view tokenizer given many context views and rendered into novel views by employing a light-weight rectified flow decoder. We show that the compression is 1-3 orders of magnitude stronger than for other representations while still reaching state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. Further, our representation can be rendered from novel trajectories, including ones deviating from the input trajectory, and we show that the decoder gracefully handles uncertainty. Finally, the highly-compressed set of unstructured latent scene tokens enables simple and efficient scene generation in 5 seconds, achieving a much better quality-speed trade-off than previous paradigms.

Conclusion: PhysConvex通过物理驱动的凸体表示统一视觉渲染与物理模拟，为动态3D场景重建提供了兼具几何效率与仿真保真度的新框架。

Abstract: Reconstructing and simulating dynamic 3D scenes with both visual realism and physical consistency remains a fundamental challenge. Existing neural representations, such as NeRFs and 3DGS, excel in appearance reconstruction but struggle to capture complex material deformation and dynamics. We propose PhysConvex, a Physics-informed 3D Dynamic Convex Radiance Field that unifies visual rendering and physical simulation. PhysConvex represents deformable radiance fields using physically grounded convex primitives governed by continuum mechanics. We introduce a boundary-driven dynamic convex representation that models deformation through vertex and surface dynamics, capturing spatially adaptive, non-uniform deformation, and evolving boundaries. To efficiently simulate complex geometries and heterogeneous materials, we further develop a reduced-order convex simulation that advects dynamic convex fields using neural skinning eigenmodes as shape- and material-aware deformation bases with time-varying reduced DOFs under Newtonian dynamics. Convex dynamics also offers compact, gap-free volumetric coverage, enhancing both geometric efficiency and simulation fidelity. Experiments demonstrate that PhysConvex achieves high-fidelity reconstruction of geometry, appearance, and physical properties from videos, outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: The end-to-end (E2E) paradigm, which maps sensor inputs directly to driving decisions, has recently attracted significant attention due to its unified modeling capability and scalability. However, ensuring safety in this unified framework remains one of the most critical challenges. In this work, we propose SafeDrive, an E2E planning framework designed to perform explicit and interpretable safety reasoning through a trajectory-conditioned Sparse World Model. SafeDrive comprises two complementary networks: the Sparse World Network (SWNet) and the Fine-grained Reasoning Network (FRNet). SWNet constructs trajectory-conditioned sparse worlds that simulate the future behaviors of critical dynamic agents and road entities, providing interaction-centric representations for downstream reasoning. FRNet then evaluates agent-specific collision risks and temporal adherence to drivable regions, enabling precise identification of safety-critical events across future timesteps. SafeDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance on both open-loop and closed-loop benchmarks. On NAVSIM, it records a PDMS of 91.6 and an EPDMS of 87.5, with only 61 collisions out of 12,146 scenarios (0.5%). On Bench2Drive, SafeDrive attains a 66.8% driving score.

Motivation: 虽然深度学习使单目深度估计（MDE）能从单张图像获得准确深度，但将MDE融入Structure-from-Motion（SfM）仍面临挑战。MDE产生密集深度图的误差方差较大，不同于传统三角稀疏点云。

Method: 受现代RANSAC估计器启发，提出Marginalized Bundle Adjustment（MBA），利用MDE的密度来减弱其误差方差。

Result: 通过大量评估，显示MDE深度图足够准确，能在SfM和相机重定位任务中达到最先进或竞争性结果，并在不同尺度（几帧到数千张图像）下表现出始终稳健的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法凸显了MDE在多视图3D视觉中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Structure-from-Motion (SfM) is a fundamental 3D vision task for recovering camera parameters and scene geometry from multi-view images. While recent deep learning advances enable accurate Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) from single images without depending on camera motion, integrating MDE into SfM remains a challenge. Unlike conventional triangulated sparse point clouds, MDE produces dense depth maps with significantly higher error variance. Inspired by modern RANSAC estimators, we propose Marginalized Bundle Adjustment (MBA) to mitigate MDE error variance leveraging its density. With MBA, we show that MDE depth maps are sufficiently accurate to yield SoTA or competitive results in SfM and camera relocalization tasks. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate consistently robust performance across varying scales, ranging from few-frame setups to large multi-view systems with thousands of images. Our method highlights the significant potential of MDE in multi-view 3D vision.

Result: 显著改善内容风格解耦，实现对LoRA模块组合的灵活语义控制，实现高保真生成且无需额外重新训练开销

Conclusion: CRAFT-LoRA有效解决了LoRA组合中的关键挑战，在保持高效的同时实现了更好的个性化图像生成质量

Abstract: Personalized image generation requires effectively balancing content fidelity with stylistic consistency when synthesizing images based on text and reference examples. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offers an efficient personalization approach, with potential for precise control through combining LoRA weights on different concepts. However, existing combination techniques face persistent challenges: entanglement between content and style representations, insufficient guidance for controlling elements' influence, and unstable weight fusion that often require additional training. We address these limitations through CRAFT-LoRA, with complementary components: (1) rank-constrained backbone fine-tuning that injects low-rank projection residuals to encourage learning decoupled content and style subspaces; (2) a prompt-guided approach featuring an expert encoder with specialized branches that enables semantic extension and precise control through selective adapter aggregation; and (3) a training-free, timestep-dependent classifier-free guidance scheme that enhances generation stability by strategically adjusting noise predictions across diffusion steps. Our method significantly improves content-style disentanglement, enables flexible semantic control over LoRA module combinations, and achieves high-fidelity generation without additional retraining overhead.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言导航方法要么依赖多智能体导致高协调成本，要么采用单智能体范式使智能体同时承担全局规划和局部感知任务，导致长视野设置中的推理能力下降和指令漂移。需要设计新的架构来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出DACo（规划-执行解耦架构），包含两个组件：1）全局指挥官负责高层战略规划，2）局部执行者负责自我中心观察和细粒度执行。框架还集成了动态子目标规划和自适应重新规划机制。

Result: 在R2R、REVERIE和R4R数据集上的评估显示，DACo在零样本设置中相对于最佳基线分别实现了4.9%、6.5%和5.4%的绝对改进，并能有效泛化到闭源（如GPT-4o）和开源（如Qwen-VL系列）基础模型。

Conclusion: DACo为鲁棒的长视野导航提供了一个原则性和可扩展的范式，通过解耦全局推理和局部动作缓解认知过载，提高长期稳定性。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Scene navigation is a fundamental capability for embodied human-AI collaboration, requiring agents to follow natural language instructions to execute coherent action sequences in complex environments. Existing approaches either rely on multiple agents, incurring high coordination and resource costs, or adopt a single-agent paradigm, which overloads the agent with both global planning and local perception, often leading to degraded reasoning and instruction drift in long-horizon settings. To address these issues, we introduce DACo, a planning-grounding decoupled architecture that disentangles global deliberation from local grounding. Concretely, it employs a Global Commander for high-level strategic planning and a Local Operative for egocentric observing and fine-grained execution. By disentangling global reasoning from local action, DACo alleviates cognitive overload and improves long-horizon stability. The framework further integrates dynamic subgoal planning and adaptive replanning to enable structured and resilient navigation. Extensive evaluations on R2R, REVERIE, and R4R demonstrate that DACo achieves 4.9%, 6.5%, 5.4% absolute improvements over the best-performing baselines in zero-shot settings, and generalizes effectively across both closed-source (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source (e.g., Qwen-VL Series) backbones. DACo provides a principled and extensible paradigm for robust long-horizon navigation. Project page: https://github.com/ChocoWu/DACo

Abstract: Real-time hand tracking in trauma surgery is essential for supporting rapid and precise intraoperative decisions. We propose a YOLOv10-based framework that simultaneously localizes hands and classifies their laterality (left or right) in complex surgical scenes. The model is trained on the Trauma THOMPSON Challenge 2025 Task 2 dataset, consisting of first-person surgical videos with annotated hand bounding boxes. Extensive data augmentation and a multi-task detection design improve robustness against motion blur, lighting variations, and diverse hand appearances. Evaluation demonstrates accurate left-hand (67\%) and right-hand (71\%) classification, while distinguishing hands from the background remains challenging. The model achieves an $mAP_{[0.5:0.95]}$ of 0.33 and maintains real-time inference, highlighting its potential for intraoperative deployment. This work establishes a foundation for advanced hand-instrument interaction analysis in emergency surgical procedures.

Abstract: Adapting image-pretrained backbones to video typically relies on time-domain adapters tuned to a single temporal scale. Our experiments show that these modules pick up static image cues and very fast flicker changes, while overlooking medium-speed motion. Capturing dynamics across multiple time-scales is, however, crucial for fine-grained temporal analysis (i.e., opening vs. closing bottle).
  To address this, we introduce Frame2Freq -- a family of frequency-aware adapters that perform spectral encoding during image-to-video adaptation of pretrained Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), improving fine-grained action recognition. Frame2Freq uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) along time and learns frequency-band specific embeddings that adaptively highlight the most discriminative frequency ranges. Across five fine-grained activity recognition datasets, Frame2Freq outperforms prior PEFT methods and even surpasses fully fine-tuned models on four of them. These results provide encouraging evidence that frequency analysis methods are a powerful tool for modeling temporal dynamics in image-to-video transfer.

Conclusion: SeaCache通过频谱对齐表征有效捕获扩散演化的内容-噪声分离特性，提供了一种高效且高质量的扩散模型采样加速方案

Abstract: Diffusion models are a strong backbone for visual generation, but their inherently sequential denoising process leads to slow inference. Previous methods accelerate sampling by caching and reusing intermediate outputs based on feature distances between adjacent timesteps. However, existing caching strategies typically rely on raw feature differences that entangle content and noise. This design overlooks spectral evolution, where low-frequency structure appears early and high-frequency detail is refined later. We introduce Spectral-Evolution-Aware Cache (SeaCache), a training-free cache schedule that bases reuse decisions on a spectrally aligned representation. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we derive a Spectral-Evolution-Aware (SEA) filter that preserves content-relevant components while suppressing noise. Employing SEA-filtered input features to estimate redundancy leads to dynamic schedules that adapt to content while respecting the spectral priors underlying the diffusion model. Extensive experiments on diverse visual generative models and the baselines show that SeaCache achieves state-of-the-art latency-quality trade-offs.

Abstract: We study the task of establishing object-level visual correspondence across different viewpoints in videos, focusing on the challenging egocentric-to-exocentric and exocentric-to-egocentric scenarios. We propose a simple yet effective framework based on conditional binary segmentation, where an object query mask is encoded into a latent representation to guide the localization of the corresponding object in a target video. To encourage robust, view-invariant representations, we introduce a cycle-consistency training objective: the predicted mask in the target view is projected back to the source view to reconstruct the original query mask. This bidirectional constraint provides a strong self-supervisory signal without requiring ground-truth annotations and enables test-time training (TTT) at inference. Experiments on the Ego-Exo4D and HANDAL-X benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our optimization objective and TTT strategy, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Motivation: 现代视觉语言模型具备强大的推理能力，为高级个性化研究开辟了新前沿，但该领域进展严重缺乏合适的基准测试。

Method: 提出了Life-Bench——基于模拟用户数字足迹的合成生成多模态基准测试，包含广泛能力评估；同时提出LifeGraph——将个人上下文组织成知识图谱以支持结构化检索和推理的端到端框架。

Result: 实验表明，现有方法在复杂个性化任务上表现不佳，尤其在关系、时间和聚合推理方面存在巨大性能差距。LifeGraph通过结构化知识利用显著缩小了这一差距。

Conclusion: 尽管LifeGraph展示了有前景的方向，但高级个性化任务仍是关键开放挑战，需要该领域的新研究。

Abstract: The powerful reasoning of modern Vision Language Models open a new frontier for advanced personalization study. However, progress in this area is critically hampered by the lack of suitable benchmarks. To address this gap, we introduce Life-Bench, a comprehensive, synthetically generated multimodal benchmark built on simulated user digital footprints. Life-Bench features over questions evaluating a wide spectrum of capabilities, from persona understanding to complex reasoning over historical data. These capabilities expand far beyond prior benchmarks, reflecting the critical demands essential for real-world applications. Furthermore, we propose LifeGraph, an end-to-end framework that organizes personal context into a knowledge graph to facilitate structured retrieval and reasoning. Our experiments on Life-Bench reveal that existing methods falter significantly on complex personalized tasks, exposing a large performance headroom, especially in relational, temporal and aggregative reasoning. While LifeGraph closes this gap by leveraging structured knowledge and demonstrates a promising direction, these advanced personalization tasks remain a critical open challenge, motivating new research in this area.

*Duc Duy Nguyen,Tat-Jun Chin,Minh Hoai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个称为MoBind的对比学习框架，用于对齐IMU信号与2D姿态序列，支持跨模态检索等任务，并解决了过滤无关特征、建模多传感器配置和实现细粒度时间对齐等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在学习IMU信号与视频提取的2D姿态序列之间的联合表示，以实现跨模态检索、时间同步、主体和身体部位定位以及动作识别等多任务应用。

Method: MoBind采用分层对比学习框架，使用骨骼运动序列而非原始像素对齐IMU信号，将全身运动分解为局部身体部位轨迹并与对应IMU配对，通过词汇级时间片段对齐和本地全局对齐融合的层次对比策略进行跨模态对齐。

Result: 在mRi、TotalCapture和EgoHumans数据集上进行评估，MoBind在所有四项任务中均显著优于多种基线方法，表现出稳健的细粒度时间对齐能力，同时保持了跨模态的粗粒度语义一致性。

Conclusion: MoBind通过层次对比学习框架成功对齐IMU与姿态序列，在多项跨模态任务中实现优异性能，其代码已开源可供研究使用。

Abstract: We aim to learn a joint representation between inertial measurement unit (IMU) signals and 2D pose sequences extracted from video, enabling accurate cross-modal retrieval, temporal synchronization, subject and body-part localization, and action recognition. To this end, we introduce MoBind, a hierarchical contrastive learning framework designed to address three challenges: (1) filtering out irrelevant visual background, (2) modeling structured multi-sensor IMU configurations, and (3) achieving fine-grained, sub-second temporal alignment. To isolate motion-relevant cues, MoBind aligns IMU signals with skeletal motion sequences rather than raw pixels. We further decompose full-body motion into local body-part trajectories, pairing each with its corresponding IMU to enable semantically grounded multi-sensor alignment. To capture detailed temporal correspondence, MoBind employs a hierarchical contrastive strategy that first aligns token-level temporal segments, then fuses local (body-part) alignment with global (body-wide) motion aggregation. Evaluated on mRi, TotalCapture, and EgoHumans, MoBind consistently outperforms strong baselines across all four tasks, demonstrating robust fine-grained temporal alignment while preserving coarse semantic consistency across modalities.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种无配对病理知识蒸馏策略，通过训练微超声编码器模拟预训练的病理基础模型的嵌入分布，实现对前列腺癌的非侵入性分级，无需患者级别的配对或图像配准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模型在粗分辨率下难以推断组织微观结构，而非侵入性的前列腺癌分级有助于加快分诊并指导活检，因此需要开发更有效的基于微超声的分级方法。

Method: 研究者引入了一种无配对的病理学知识蒸馏策略：训练微超声编码器来模拟预训练的病理学基础模型的嵌入分布（以ISUP分级为条件）。训练过程不需要患者级的配对或图像配准，且推理时不需要病理学输入。

Result: 与当前最佳方法相比，该方法在60%特异性时对临床显著前列腺癌（csPCa）的敏感性提高了3.5%，同时将整体敏感性在相同特异性下提高了1.2%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过仅从影像中实现更早且更可靠的癌症风险分层，提高了临床可行性。源代码将在发表后公开。

Abstract: Purpose: Non-invasive grading of prostate cancer (PCa) from micro-ultrasound (micro-US) could expedite triage and guide biopsies toward the most aggressive regions, yet current models struggle to infer tissue micro-structure at coarse imaging resolutions.
  Methods: We introduce an unpaired histopathology knowledge-distillation strategy that trains a micro-US encoder to emulate the embedding distribution of a pretrained histopathology foundation model, conditioned on International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grades. Training requires no patient-level pairing or image registration, and histopathology inputs are not used at inference.
  Results: Compared to the current state of the art, our approach increases sensitivity to clinically significant PCa (csPCa) at 60% specificity by 3.5% and improves overall sensitivity at 60% specificity by 1.2%.
  Conclusion: By enabling earlier and more dependable cancer risk stratification solely from imaging, our method advances clinical feasibility. Source code will be publicly released upon publication.

Abstract: Generative AI models pose a significant challenge to intellectual property (IP), as they can replicate unique artistic styles and concepts without attribution. While watermarking offers a potential solution, existing methods often fail in complex scenarios where multiple concepts (e.g., an object and an artistic style) are composed within a single image. These methods struggle to disentangle and attribute each concept individually. In this work, we introduce TokenTrace, a novel proactive watermarking framework for robust, multi-concept attribution. Our method embeds secret signatures into the semantic domain by simultaneously perturbing the text prompt embedding and the initial latent noise that guide the diffusion model's generation process. For retrieval, we propose a query-based TokenTrace module that takes the generated image and a textual query specifying which concepts need to be retrieved (e.g., a specific object or style) as inputs. This query-based mechanism allows the module to disentangle and independently verify the presence of multiple concepts from a single generated image. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-concept (object and style) and multi-concept attribution tasks, significantly outperforming existing baselines while maintaining high visual quality and robustness to common transformations.

TL;DR: 提出一个校准框架，通过在标准交叉熵损失中添加两项正则化项来改善CLIP提示调校中的置信度校准问题，同时保持预训练嵌入空间的几何结构以提升泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉-语言模型（如CLIP）的提示调校虽然能高效适应任务，但往往导致置信度校准不佳和预测不确定性不可靠。现有方法在提升置信度校准时常破坏预训练嵌入空间的几何结构，从而损害模型的泛化能力。

Method: 在标准交叉熵损失的基础上引入两项互补的正则化项：1）均值-方差边际惩罚，通过最大化类间logit边界的平均值并最小化其离散度来稳定类间边界，缓解欠置信和过置信问题；2）文本矩匹配损失，使调校后的文本嵌入的一阶矩和二阶矩与冻结的CLIP文本嵌入对齐，保持对泛化至关重要的语义离散性。

Result: 在7种提示调校方法和11个多样化数据集上进行广泛实验，结果表明该方法在基础类别和新类别上都显著降低了预期校准误差（ECE），优于其他竞争性校准技术。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了提示调校后模型的预测可靠性，同时保持了预训练嵌入空间的几何结构，从而实现了更好的泛化性能，为视觉-语言模型的可靠部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Prompt tuning of large-scale vision-language models such as CLIP enables efficient task adaptation without updating model weights. However, it often leads to poor confidence calibration and unreliable predictive uncertainty. We address this problem by proposing a calibration framework that enhances predictive reliability while preserving the geometry of the pretrained CLIP embedding space, which is required for robust generalization. Our approach extends the standard cross-entropy loss with two complementary regularizers: (1) a mean-variance margin penalty that stabilizes inter-class logit margins by maximizing their average while minimizing dispersion, mitigating underconfidence and overconfidence spikes; and (2) a text moment-matching loss that aligns the first and second moments of tuned text embeddings with their frozen CLIP counterparts, preserving semantic dispersion crucial for generalization. Through extensive experiments across 7 prompt-tuning methods and 11 diverse datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) compared to competitive calibration techniques on both base and novel classes

TL;DR: 提出OpenVO框架，解决开放世界视觉里程计中因观测频率变化和相机未标定导致的性能下降问题，通过在双帧位姿回归框架中显式编码时序动态信息，并利用基础模型的3D几何先验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VO方法在固定观测频率下训练，完全忽略时序动态信息，且需要已知内参的标定相机。这导致在未见观测频率或未标定相机（如行车记录仪场景）下性能下降，限制了下游任务（如从行车记录仪提取轨迹）的泛化能力。

Method: 1) 在双帧位姿回归框架中显式编码时序动态信息；2) 利用基础模型提取的3D几何先验。

Result: 在KITTI、nuScenes、Argoverse 2三大自动驾驶基准测试中，性能提升超过20%；在变化观测频率设置下，所有指标误差降低46%-92%，鲁棒性显著提升。

Conclusion: OpenVO展示了其对于真实世界3D重建和多样化下游应用的强大适应性和实用性。

Abstract: We introduce OpenVO, a novel framework for Open-world Visual Odometry (VO) with temporal awareness under limited input conditions. OpenVO effectively estimates real-world-scale ego-motion from monocular dashcam footage with varying observation rates and uncalibrated cameras, enabling robust trajectory dataset construction from rare driving events recorded in dashcam. Existing VO methods are trained on fixed observation frequency (e.g., 10Hz or 12Hz), completely overlooking temporal dynamics information. Many prior methods also require calibrated cameras with known intrinsic parameters. Consequently, their performance degrades when (1) deployed under unseen observation frequencies or (2) applied to uncalibrated cameras. These significantly limit their generalizability to many downstream tasks, such as extracting trajectories from dashcam footage. To address these challenges, OpenVO (1) explicitly encodes temporal dynamics information within a two-frame pose regression framework and (2) leverages 3D geometric priors derived from foundation models. We validate our method on three major autonomous-driving benchmarks - KITTI, nuScenes, and Argoverse 2 - achieving more than 20 performance improvement over state-of-the-art approaches. Under varying observation rate settings, our method is significantly more robust, achieving 46%-92% lower errors across all metrics. These results demonstrate the versatility of OpenVO for real-world 3D reconstruction and diverse downstream applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于非等距图像生成服装纹理的新方法，通过构建3D服装视频数据集和基于Nano Banana的图像编辑技术，实现跨姿态、跨拓扑的高质量PBR纹理生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工业3D服装网格已涵盖大多数真实世界服装几何形状，但其纹理多样性有限。现有方法需要输入图像与3D网格之间严格的拓扑一致性或精确的网格变形匹配，这严重制约了纹理生成的质量和灵活性。

Method: 1. 构建3D Garment Videos数据集，通过物理模拟提供在不同变形下具有一致几何和材质监督的数据；2. 使用Nano Banana进行高质量非等距图像编辑，实现非等距图像-几何对之间的可靠跨拓扑纹理生成；3. 提出基于不确定性引导视图选择和重加权的迭代烘焙方法，将多视图预测融合为无缝的PBR纹理。

Result: 实验表明，该前馈双分支架构能够生成多样化且空间对齐的PBR材质，适合工业级3D服装设计。

Conclusion: 该方法通过创新的数据集构建、非等距图像编辑技术和迭代烘焙策略，有效解决了服装纹理生成的挑战，为工业级3D服装设计提供了灵活且高质量的纹理生成方案。

Abstract: Existing industrial 3D garment meshes already cover most real-world clothing geometries, yet their texture diversity remains limited. To acquire more realistic textures, generative methods are often used to extract Physically-based Rendering (PBR) textures and materials from large collections of wild images and project them back onto garment meshes. However, most image-conditioned texture generation approaches require strict topological consistency between the input image and the input 3D mesh, or rely on accurate mesh deformation to match to the image poses, which significantly constrains the texture generation quality and flexibility. To address the challenging problem of non-isometric image-based garment texture generation, we construct 3D Garment Videos, a physically simulated, garment-centric dataset that provides consistent geometry and material supervision across diverse deformations, enabling robust cross-pose texture learning. We further employ Nano Banana for high-quality non-isometric image editing, achieving reliable cross-topology texture generation between non-isometric image-geometry pairs. Finally, we propose an iterative baking method via uncertainty-guided view selection and reweighting that fuses multi-view predictions into seamless, production-ready PBR textures. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our feedforward dual-branch architecture generates versatile and spatially aligned PBR materials suitable for industry-level 3D garment design.

TL;DR: TeFlow解决了自监督前馈场景光流估计中由于遮挡导致的两帧对应不可靠问题，通过挖掘多帧中时间一致的运动线索来提升监督信号质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督前馈场景光流方法主要依赖于两帧间的点对应关系进行监督，但在遮挡情况下这种监督信号往往不可靠且容易失效。而多帧监督能提供更稳定的运动线索，但直接将两帧监督扩展到多帧会因帧间对应关系突变而产生不一致信号。因此，需要一种能有效利用多帧一致运动信息的监督策略。

Method: TeFlow通过时间集成策略来实现多帧监督，该方法从多帧构建的候选池中聚合最时间一致的运动线索，形成可靠的监督信号。

Result: 在Argoverse 2和nuScenes等挑战性数据集上，TeFlow实现了33%的性能提升，达到了自监督前馈方法的最新水平。与领先的优化方法性能相当，但速度快了150倍。

Conclusion: TeFlow表明通过挖掘多帧中的时间一致运动线索，可以显著提升自监督前馈场景光流估计的性能，在保持实时效率的同时达到与优化方法相媲美的精度。

Abstract: Self-supervised feed-forward methods for scene flow estimation offer real-time efficiency, but their supervision from two-frame point correspondences is unreliable and often breaks down under occlusions. Multi-frame supervision has the potential to provide more stable guidance by incorporating motion cues from past frames, yet naive extensions of two-frame objectives are ineffective because point correspondences vary abruptly across frames, producing inconsistent signals. In the paper, we present TeFlow, enabling multi-frame supervision for feed-forward models by mining temporally consistent supervision. TeFlow introduces a temporal ensembling strategy that forms reliable supervisory signals by aggregating the most temporally consistent motion cues from a candidate pool built across multiple frames. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that TeFlow establishes a new state-of-the-art for self-supervised feed-forward methods, achieving performance gains of up to 33\% on the challenging Argoverse 2 and nuScenes datasets. Our method performs on par with leading optimization-based methods, yet speeds up 150 times. The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/KTH-RPL/OpenSceneFlow along with trained model weights.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D大语言模型依赖ego poses进行方向性问答和空间推理，但大多数点云基准包含丰富方向性查询却缺乏对应ego poses，导致问题定义不完善。

Method: 1) PoseRecover：通过物体视锥交叉和Z-buffer可见性检查，从RGB-D视频外参中自动匹配问题与ego poses的完整管道；2) PoseAlign：根据识别的ego poses变换点云数据，而非将姿态信息注入文本提示或投影层。

Result: 在多个3D LMM骨干模型（LL3DA、LL3DA-SONATA、Chat-Scene、3D-LLAVA）上取得一致改进：ScanRefer mIoU提升30.0%，Scan2Cap LLM-as-judge准确率提升11.7%。该方法仅需指令微调，简单通用且训练高效。

Conclusion: 提出了一套简单通用、训练高效的方向感知3D-LMM解决方案，通过自动姿态恢复和点云对齐建立了该领域的强基线，解决了现有基准缺乏姿态信息的内在缺陷。

Abstract: 3D large multimodal models (3D LMMs) rely heavily on ego poses for enabling directional question-answering and spatial reasoning. However, most existing point cloud benchmarks contain rich directional queries but lack the corresponding ego poses, making them inherently ill-posed in 3D large multimodal modelling. In this work, we redefine a new and rigorous paradigm that enables direction-aware 3D LMMs by identifying and supplementing ego poses into point cloud benchmarks and transforming the corresponding point cloud data according to the identified ego poses. We enable direction-aware 3D LMMs with two novel designs. The first is PoseRecover, a fully automatic pose recovery pipeline that matches questions with ego poses from RGB-D video extrinsics via object-frustum intersection and visibility check with Z-buffers. The second is PoseAlign that transforms the point cloud data to be aligned with the identified ego poses instead of either injecting ego poses into textual prompts or introducing pose-encoded features in the projection layers. Extensive experiments show that our designs yield consistent improvements across multiple 3D LMM backbones such as LL3DA, LL3DA-SONATA, Chat-Scene, and 3D-LLAVA, improving ScanRefer mIoU by 30.0% and Scan2Cap LLM-as-judge accuracy by 11.7%. In addition, our approach is simple, generic, and training-efficient, requiring only instruction tuning while establishing a strong baseline for direction-aware 3D-LMMs.

Abstract: Range-view (RV) based LiDAR diffusion has recently made huge strides towards 2D photo-realism. However, it neglects 3D geometry realism and often generates various RV artifacts such as depth bleeding and wavy surfaces. We design L3DR, a 3D-aware LiDAR Diffusion and Rectification framework that can regress and cancel RV artifacts in 3D space and restore local geometry accurately. Our theoretical and empirical analysis reveals that 3D models are inherently superior to 2D models in generating sharp and authentic boundaries. Leveraging such analysis, we design a 3D residual regression network that rectifies RV artifacts and achieves superb geometry realism by predicting point-level offsets in 3D space. On top of that, we design a Welsch Loss that helps focus on local geometry and ignore anomalous regions effectively. Extensive experiments over multiple benchmarks including KITTI, KITTI360, nuScenes and Waymo show that the proposed L3DR achieves state-of-the-art generation and superior geometry-realism consistently. In addition, L3DR is generally applicable to different LiDAR diffusion models with little computational overhead.

Conclusion: ChordEdit通过理论驱动的最优输运方法，为一类具有挑战性的一步式文生图模型带来了实用的实时编辑能力，为高效文本引导图像编辑提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The advent of one-step text-to-image (T2I) models offers unprecedented synthesis speed. However, their application to text-guided image editing remains severely hampered, as forcing existing training-free editors into a single inference step fails. This failure manifests as severe object distortion and a critical loss of consistency in non-edited regions, resulting from the high-energy, erratic trajectories produced by naive vector arithmetic on the models' structured fields. To address this problem, we introduce ChordEdit, a model agnostic, training-free, and inversion-free method that facilitates high-fidelity one-step editing. We recast editing as a transport problem between the source and target distributions defined by the source and target text prompts. Leveraging dynamic optimal transport theory, we derive a principled, low-energy control strategy. This strategy yields a smoothed, variance-reduced editing field that is inherently stable, facilitating the field to be traversed in a single, large integration step. A theoretically grounded and experimentally validated approach allows ChordEdit to deliver fast, lightweight and precise edits, finally achieving true real-time editing on these challenging models.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个名为RG-KCR的三阶段修复引导的古代日本变体草书字符识别框架，专门用于解决印章遮挡字符的干扰问题，在手写草书字符识别数据集上取得了先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 古代日本变体草书（Kuzushiji）因高度草书写法和广泛字形变体，现代读者难以直接解读。现有自动识别方法在文档图像清晰时表现良好，但在印章干扰（尤其是印章覆盖字符）时识别准确性明显下降，而印章在历史文档中频繁出现，因此需要专门解决这一挑战。

Method: 提出三阶段修复引导的Kuzushiji字符识别（RG-KCR）框架：第一阶段进行字符检测，第二阶段进行印章干扰修复，第三阶段进行字符分类。构建了用于评估字符检测和分类的数据集，并使用YOLOv12-medium进行检测，采用基于Vision Transformer的Metom模型进行分类。

Result: 实验结果显示：YOLOv12-medium在测试集上的精确率达98.0%，召回率达93.3%；通过PSNR和SSIM定量评估修复性能；消融研究表明，第二阶段将基于ViT的分类器Top-1准确率从93.45%提升至95.33%。

Conclusion: RG-KCR框架有效缓解了印章干扰对古代日本变体草书字符识别的影响，通过在字符检测和分类之间加入修复阶段，显著提升了印章遮挡情况下的识别准确性，为该领域的研究提供了有价值的解决方案。

Abstract: Kuzushiji was one of the most popular writing styles in pre-modern Japan and was widely used in both personal letters and official documents. However, due to its highly cursive forms and extensive glyph variations, most modern Japanese readers cannot directly interpret Kuzushiji characters. Therefore, recent research has focused on developing automated Kuzushiji character recognition methods, which have achieved satisfactory performance on relatively clean Kuzushiji document images. However, existing methods struggle to maintain recognition accuracy under seal interference (e.g., when seals overlap characters), despite the frequent occurrence of seals in pre-modern Japanese documents. To address this challenge, we propose a three-stage restoration-guided Kuzushiji character recognition (RG-KCR) framework specifically designed to mitigate seal interference. We construct datasets for evaluating Kuzushiji character detection (Stage 1) and classification (Stage 3). Experimental results show that the YOLOv12-medium model achieves a precision of 98.0% and a recall of 93.3% on the constructed test set. We quantitatively evaluate the restoration performance of Stage 2 using PSNR and SSIM. In addition, we conduct an ablation study to demonstrate that Stage 2 improves the Top-1 accuracy of Metom, a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based Kuzushiji classifier employed in Stage 3, from 93.45% to 95.33%.

Abstract: Current 3D human animation methods struggle to achieve photorealism: kinematics-based approaches lack non-rigid dynamics (e.g., clothing dynamics), while methods that leverage video diffusion priors can synthesize non-rigid motion but suffer from quality artifacts and identity loss. To overcome these limitations, we present Ani3DHuman, a framework that marries kinematics-based animation with video diffusion priors. We first introduce a layered motion representation that disentangles rigid motion from residual non-rigid motion. Rigid motion is generated by a kinematic method, which then produces a coarse rendering to guide the video diffusion model in generating video sequences that restore the residual non-rigid motion. However, this restoration task, based on diffusion sampling, is highly challenging, as the initial renderings are out-of-distribution, causing standard deterministic ODE samplers to fail. Therefore, we propose a novel self-guided stochastic sampling method, which effectively addresses the out-of-distribution problem by combining stochastic sampling (for photorealistic quality) with self-guidance (for identity fidelity). These restored videos provide high-quality supervision, enabling the optimization of the residual non-rigid motion field. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \MethodName can generate photorealistic 3D human animation, outperforming existing methods. Code is available in https://github.com/qiisun/ani3dhuman.

TL;DR: 论文提出CREM框架，通过压缩驱动的方法统一提升多模态模型的检索性能，同时保持其生成能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大模型在理解任务上表现出色，但由于输出格式和优化目标不匹配，在检索任务上表现不佳。现有方法通过对比微调来适配检索，但会牺牲生成能力。作者认为生成和嵌入任务都依赖于跨模态表示对齐和上下文理解这一共同认知机制

Method: CREM框架：1）基于压缩的提示设计，使用可学习的聚集令牌聚合多模态语义；2）压缩驱动的训练策略，通过压缩感知注意力整合对比学习和生成目标

Result: CREM在MMEB基准上取得了最先进的检索性能，同时在多个理解基准上保持了强大的生成性能

Conclusion: 研究发现，在压缩驱动范式下，生成监督可以进一步提高多模态大模型表示质量，验证了生成能力和检索能力可以协同统一提升

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable success in comprehension tasks such as visual description and visual question answering. However, their direct application to embedding-based tasks like retrieval remains challenging due to the discrepancy between output formats and optimization objectives. Previous approaches often employ contrastive fine-tuning to adapt MLLMs for retrieval, but at the cost of losing their generative capabilities. We argue that both generative and embedding tasks fundamentally rely on shared cognitive mechanisms, specifically cross-modal representation alignment and contextual comprehension. To this end, we propose CREM (Compression-driven Representation Enhanced Model), with a unified framework that enhances multimodal representations for retrieval while preserving generative ability. Specifically, we introduce a compression-based prompt design with learnable chorus tokens to aggregate multimodal semantics and a compression-driven training strategy that integrates contrastive and generative objectives through compression-aware attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CREM achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance on MMEB while maintaining strong generative performance on multiple comprehension benchmarks. Our findings highlight that generative supervision can further improve the representational quality of MLLMs under the proposed compression-driven paradigm.

Abstract: Establishing dense correspondences between shapes is a crucial task in computer vision and graphics, while prior approaches depend on near-isometric assumptions and homogeneous subject types (i.e., only operate for human shapes). However, building semantic correspondences for cross-category objects remains challenging and has received relatively little attention. To achieve this, we propose UniMatch, a semantic-aware, coarse-to-fine framework for constructing dense semantic correspondences between strongly non-isometric shapes without restricting object categories. The key insight is to lift "coarse" semantic cues into "fine" correspondence, which is achieved through two stages. In the "coarse" stage, we perform class-agnostic 3D segmentation to obtain non-overlapping semantic parts and prompt multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to identify part names. Then, we employ pretrained vision language models (VLMs) to extract text embeddings, enabling the construction of matched semantic parts. In the "fine" stage, we leverage these coarse correspondences to guide the learning of dense correspondences through a dedicated rank-based contrastive scheme. Thanks to class-agnostic segmentation, language guiding, and rank-based contrastive learning, our method is versatile for universal object categories and requires no predefined part proposals, enabling universal matching for inter-class and non-isometric shapes. Extensive experiments demonstrate UniMatch consistently outperforms competing methods in various challenging scenarios.

TL;DR: SymPL框架将以物体为中心的空间推理转化为符号布局表示，提升视觉语言模型在处理视角感知空间推理方面的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在自我中心视角下表现良好，但在以物体为中心的空间推理中性能下降，这需要从场景中物体的视角推断空间关系。本研究旨在解决这一未被充分探索的挑战。

Method: 引入符号投影布局(SymPL)框架，通过投影、抽象、二分和本地化四个关键因素，将以物体为中心的问题转化为结构化的符号布局表示，这种形式更适合视觉语言模型处理。

Result: 实验表明，这种重构显著提高了在以物体为中心和自我中心任务中的表现，增强了在视觉错觉和多视图场景下的鲁棒性，并且每个组件都对性能提升起关键作用。

Conclusion: SymPL为解决复杂的视角感知空间推理提供了一种有效且有原则的方法

Abstract: Perspective-aware spatial reasoning involves understanding spatial relationships from specific viewpoints-either egocentric (observer-centered) or allocentric (object-centered). While vision-language models (VLMs) perform well in egocentric settings, their performance deteriorates when reasoning from allocentric viewpoints, where spatial relations must be inferred from the perspective of objects within the scene. In this study, we address this underexplored challenge by introducing Symbolic Projective Layout (SymPL), a framework that reformulates allocentric reasoning into symbolic-layout forms that VLMs inherently handle well. By leveraging four key factors-projection, abstraction, bipartition, and localization-SymPL converts allocentric questions into structured symbolic-layout representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this reformulation substantially improves performance in both allocentric and egocentric tasks, enhances robustness under visual illusions and multi-view scenarios, and that each component contributes critically to these gains. These results show that SymPL provides an effective and principled approach for addressing complex perspective-aware spatial reasoning.

Abstract: The fine-grained classification of street trees is a crucial task for urban planning, streetscape management, and the assessment of urban ecosystem services. However, progress in this field has been significantly hindered by the lack of large-scale, geographically diverse, and publicly available benchmark datasets specifically designed for street trees. To address this critical gap, we introduce StreetTree, the world's first large-scale benchmark dataset dedicated to fine-grained street tree classification. The dataset contains over 12 million images covering more than 8,300 common street tree species, collected from urban streetscapes across 133 countries spanning five continents, and supplemented with expert-verified observational data. StreetTree poses substantial challenges for pretrained vision models under complex urban environments: high inter-species visual similarity, long-tailed natural distributions, significant intra-class variations caused by seasonal changes, and diverse imaging conditions such as lighting, occlusions from buildings, and varying camera angles. In addition, we provide a hierarchical taxonomy (order-family-genus-species) to support research in hierarchical classification and representation learning. Through extensive experiments with various visual models, we establish strong baselines and reveal the limitations of existing methods in handling such real-world complexities. We believe that StreetTree will serve as a key resource for the refined management and research of urban street trees, while also driving new advancements at the intersection of computer vision and urban science.

Abstract: The escalating parameter counts in modern deep learning models pose a fundamental challenge to efficient training and resolution of overfitting. We address this by introducing the \emph{Mapping Networks} which replace the high dimensional weight space by a compact, trainable latent vector based on the hypothesis that the trained parameters of large networks reside on smooth, low-dimensional manifolds. Henceforth, the Mapping Theorem enforced by a dedicated Mapping Loss, shows the existence of a mapping from this latent space to the target weight space both theoretically and in practice. Mapping Networks significantly reduce overfitting and achieve comparable to better performance than target network across complex vision and sequence tasks, including Image Classification, Deepfake Detection etc, with $\mathbf{99.5\%}$, i.e., around $500\times$ reduction in trainable parameters.

Abstract: Modality gap significantly restricts the effectiveness of multimodal fusion. Previous methods often use techniques such as diffusion models and adversarial learning to reduce the modality gap, but they typically focus on one-to-one alignment without exposing the data points of the source modality to the global distribution information of the target modality. To this end, leveraging the characteristic of rectified flow that can map one distribution to another via a straight trajectory, we extend rectified flow for modality distribution mapping. Specifically, we leverage the `one-to-many mapping' strategy in rectified flow that allows each data point of the source modality to observe the overall target distribution. This also alleviates the issue of insufficient paired data within each sample, enabling a more robust distribution transformation. Moreover, to achieve more accurate distribution mapping and address the ambiguous flow directions in one-to-many mapping, we design `adaptive relaxed alignment', enforcing stricter alignment for modality pairs belonging to the same sample, while applying relaxed mapping for pairs not belonging to the same sample or category. Additionally, to prevent information loss during distribution mapping, we introduce `cyclic rectified flow' to ensure the transferred features can be translated back to the original features, allowing multimodal representations to learn sufficient modality-specific information. After distribution alignment, our approach achieves very competitive results on multiple tasks of multimodal affective computing even with a simple fusion method, and visualizations verify that it can effectively reduce the modality gap.

Motivation: 先前的研究主要关注纯文本指导，或者将视觉和语言分离处理，缺乏对视觉输入、教学计划和交互式对话进行综合推理的能力。

Method: VIGiA整合了两种关键能力：(1) 多模态计划推理，使模型能够将单模态和多模态查询与当前任务计划对齐并准确回应；(2) 基于计划的检索，允许检索文本或视觉表示中相关的计划步骤。

Result: 在包含丰富烹饪和DIY计划的教学视频对话数据集上的评估显示，VIGiA在对话式计划指导设置中的所有任务上都超越了现有的最先进模型，在计划感知VQA上达到了超过90%的准确率。

Conclusion: VIGiA通过融合多模态计划推理和计划检索能力，在理解和指导复杂多步骤视频动作计划方面表现出显著优势，为教学视频对话系统提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce VIGiA, a novel multimodal dialogue model designed to understand and reason over complex, multi-step instructional video action plans. Unlike prior work which focuses mainly on text-only guidance, or treats vision and language in isolation, VIGiA supports grounded, plan-aware dialogue that requires reasoning over visual inputs, instructional plans, and interleaved user interactions. To this end, VIGiA incorporates two key capabilities: (1) multimodal plan reasoning, enabling the model to align uni- and multimodal queries with the current task plan and respond accurately; and (2) plan-based retrieval, allowing it to retrieve relevant plan steps in either textual or visual representations. Experiments were done on a novel dataset with rich Instructional Video Dialogues aligned with Cooking and DIY plans. Our evaluation shows that VIGiA outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on all tasks in a conversational plan guidance setting, reaching over 90\% accuracy on plan-aware VQA.

Result: 在独立测试集上，模型在目标级别表现出色：召回率0.9737，精确率0.8043，AP@0.50为93.56%；图像级诊断方面，灵敏度达100%，准确率98.8%，所有阳性病例均被正确识别。

Conclusion: 该AI系统可作为高度可靠的自动化筛查工具，有效弥合皮肤真菌学中图像分析与临床决策之间的差距。

Abstract: Dermatophytosis is commonly assessed using potassium hydroxide (KOH) microscopy, yet accurate recognition of fungal hyphae is hindered by artefacts, heterogeneous keratin clearance, and notable inter-observer variability. This study presents a transformer-based detection framework using the RT-DETR model architecture to achieve precise, query-driven localization of fungal structures in high-resolution KOH images. A dataset of 2,540 routinely acquired microscopy images was manually annotated using a multi-class strategy to explicitly distinguish fungal elements from confounding artefacts. The model was trained with morphology-preserving augmentations to maintain the structural integrity of thin hyphae. Evaluation on an independent test set demonstrated robust object-level performance, with a recall of 0.9737, precision of 0.8043, and an AP@0.50 of 93.56%. When aggregated for image-level diagnosis, the model achieved 100% sensitivity and 98.8% accuracy, correctly identifying all positive cases without missing a single diagnosis. Qualitative outputs confirmed the robust localization of low-contrast hyphae even in artefact-rich fields. These results highlight that an artificial intelligence (AI) system can serve as a highly reliable, automated screening tool, effectively bridging the gap between image-level analysis and clinical decision-making in dermatomycology.

Conclusion: Flash-VAED框架能有效加速VAE解码器推理，缓解潜在扩散模型的延迟瓶颈，为高质量视频合成提供高效解决方案

Abstract: Latent diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, yet their inference remains costly and time-consuming. As diffusion transformers become increasingly efficient, the latency bottleneck inevitably shifts to VAE decoders. To reduce their latency while maintaining quality, we propose a universal acceleration framework for VAE decoders that preserves full alignment with the original latent distribution. Specifically, we propose (1) an independence-aware channel pruning method to effectively mitigate severe channel redundancy, and (2) a stage-wise dominant operator optimization strategy to address the high inference cost of the widely used causal 3D convolutions in VAE decoders. Based on these innovations, we construct a Flash-VAED family. Moreover, we design a three-phase dynamic distillation framework that efficiently transfers the capabilities of the original VAE decoder to Flash-VAED. Extensive experiments on Wan and LTX-Video VAE decoders demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines in both quality and speed, achieving approximately a 6$\times$ speedup while maintaining the reconstruction performance up to 96.9%. Notably, Flash-VAED accelerates the end-to-end generation pipeline by up to 36% with negligible quality drops on VBench-2.0.

Abstract: AIGC has rapidly expanded from text-to-image generation toward high-quality multimodal synthesis across video and audio. Within this context, joint audio-video generation (JAVG) has emerged as a fundamental task that produces synchronized and semantically aligned sound and vision from textual descriptions. However, compared with advanced commercial models such as Veo3, existing open-source methods still suffer from limitations in generation quality, temporal synchrony, and alignment with human preferences. To bridge the gap, this paper presents JavisDiT++, a concise yet powerful framework for unified modeling and optimization of JAVG. First, we introduce a modality-specific mixture-of-experts (MS-MoE) design that enables cross-modal interaction efficacy while enhancing single-modal generation quality. Then, we propose a temporal-aligned RoPE (TA-RoPE) strategy to achieve explicit, frame-level synchronization between audio and video tokens. Besides, we develop an audio-video direct preference optimization (AV-DPO) method to align model outputs with human preference across quality, consistency, and synchrony dimensions. Built upon Wan2.1-1.3B-T2V, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance merely with around 1M public training entries, significantly outperforming prior approaches in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Comprehensive ablation studies have been conducted to validate the effectiveness of our proposed modules. All the code, model, and dataset are released at https://JavisVerse.github.io/JavisDiT2-page.

Abstract: Action Quality Assessment (AQA) aims to score how well an action is performed and is widely used in sports analysis, rehabilitation assessment, and human skill evaluation. Multi-modal AQA has recently achieved strong progress by leveraging complementary visual and kinematic cues, yet real-world deployments often suffer from non-stationary modality imbalance, where certain modalities become missing or intermittently available due to sensor failures or annotation gaps. Existing continual AQA methods overlook this issue and assume that all modalities remain complete and stable throughout training, which restricts their practicality. To address this challenge, we introduce Bridged Modality Adaptation (BriMA), an innovative approach to multi-modal continual AQA under modality-missing conditions. BriMA consists of a memory-guided bridging imputation module that reconstructs missing modalities using both task-agnostic and task-specific representations, and a modality-aware replay mechanism that prioritizes informative samples based on modality distortion and distribution drift. Experiments on three representative multi-modal AQA datasets (RG, Fis-V, and FS1000) show that BriMA consistently improves performance under different modality-missing conditions, achieving 6--8\% higher correlation and 12--15\% lower error on average. These results demonstrate a step toward robust multi-modal AQA systems under real-world deployment constraints.

TL;DR: EMAD 是一个用于阿尔茨海默病诊断的视觉-语言框架，能够生成结构化的诊断报告，其中每个医学论断都与多模态证据明确关联。通过分层式的句子-证据-解剖的机制，以及创新的蒸馏和强化学习策略，该模型在提升诊断准确性的同时，实现了决策过程的透明和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习模型在医学影像分析中，常被视为“黑箱”系统，其决策过程既不符合临床指南，也未明确地链接到支撑证据。这在阿尔茨海默病诊断等关键领域非常不可取。因此，需要构建一个可信赖的、能够明确将诊断结论与多模态临床证据进行关联的智能系统，以提高诊断的透明度和可靠性。

Method: 本文提出了 EMAD 框架，核心是一种分层的句子-证据-解剖（SEA）关联机制：首先将生成的诊断语句与临床证据短语关联（句子-证据关联），然后将这些证据对应地定位到3D脑部磁共振成像的结构上（证据-解剖关联）。为了降低密集标注的需求，作者提出了 GTX-Distill 方法，将经过有限监督训练的教师的关联行为转移到处理模型生成报告的学生模型上。此外，还引入了可执行规则的GRPO强化微调方案，通过可验证的奖励来确保临床一致性、协议遵从性以及推理与诊断的连贯性。

Result: 在 AD-MultiSense 数据集上的实验表明，EMAD 在阿尔茨海默病的诊断准确性上达到了最佳性能，并且比现有方法生成了更透明、解剖学信息更准确的诊断报告。

Conclusion: EMAD 框架在提升阿尔茨海默病诊断模型性能的同时，通过其明确的证据-结论关联机制，显著增强了AI诊断的可解释性和透明度。该工作为构建可信赖的医学视觉-语言模型提供了一个有效的范本，并计划开源代码和标注以促进该领域的发展。

Abstract: Deep learning models for medical image analysis often act as black boxes, seldom aligning with clinical guidelines or explicitly linking decisions to supporting evidence. This is especially critical in Alzheimer's disease (AD), where predictions should be grounded in both anatomical and clinical findings. We present EMAD, a vision-language framework that generates structured AD diagnostic reports in which each claim is explicitly grounded in multimodal evidence. EMAD uses a hierarchical Sentence-Evidence-Anatomy (SEA) grounding mechanism: (i) sentence-to-evidence grounding links generated sentences to clinical evidence phrases, and (ii) evidence-to-anatomy grounding localizes corresponding structures on 3D brain MRI. To reduce dense annotation requirements, we propose GTX-Distill, which transfers grounding behavior from a teacher trained with limited supervision to a student operating on model-generated reports. We further introduce Executable-Rule GRPO, a reinforcement fine-tuning scheme with verifiable rewards that enforces clinical consistency, protocol adherence, and reasoning-diagnosis coherence. On the AD-MultiSense dataset, EMAD achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and produces more transparent, anatomically faithful reports than existing methods. We will release code and grounding annotations to support future research in trustworthy medical vision-language models.

Abstract: Human mesh recovery (HMR) from a single RGB image is inherently ambiguous, as multiple 3D poses can correspond to the same 2D observation. Recent diffusion-based methods tackle this by generating various hypotheses, but often sacrifice accuracy. They yield predictions that are either physically implausible or drift from the input image, especially under occlusion or in cluttered, in-the-wild scenes. To address this, we introduce a dual-memory augmented HMR critique agent with self-reflection to produce context-aware quality scores for predicted meshes. These scores distill fine-grained cues about 3D human motion structure, physical feasibility, and alignment with the input image. We use these scores to build a group-wise HMR preference dataset. Leveraging this dataset, we propose a group preference alignment framework for finetuning diffusion-based HMR models. This process injects the rich preference signals into the model, guiding it to generate more physically plausible and image-consistent human meshes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: In recent years, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance in OCR-centric Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, illustrating their capability to process heterogeneous data and exhibit adaptability across varied contexts. However, these MLLMs rely on a Large Language Model (LLM) as the decoder, which is primarily designed for linguistic processing, and thus inherently lacks the positional reasoning required for precise visual tasks, such as text spotting and text grounding. Additionally, the extensive parameters of MLLMs necessitate substantial computational resources and large-scale data for effective training. Conversely, text spotting specialists achieve state-of-the-art coordinate predictions but lack semantic reasoning capabilities. This dichotomy motivates our key research question: Can we synergize the efficiency of specialists with the contextual power of LLMs to create a positionally-accurate MLLM? To overcome these challenges, we introduce PositionOCR, a parameter-efficient hybrid architecture that seamlessly integrates a text spotting model's positional strengths with an LLM's contextual reasoning. Comprising 131M trainable parameters, this framework demonstrates outstanding multi-modal processing capabilities, particularly excelling in tasks such as text grounding and text spotting, consistently surpassing traditional MLLMs.

Abstract: Research on the intelligent interpretation of all-weather, all-time Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is crucial for advancing remote sensing applications. In recent years, although Visual Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong open-world understanding capabilities on RGB images, their performance is severely limited when directly applied to the SAR field due to the complexity of the imaging mechanism, sensitivity to scattering features, and the scarcity of high-quality text corpora. To systematically address this issue, we constructed the inaugural SAR Image-Text-AlphaEarth feature triplet dataset and developed FUSAR-GPT, a VLM specifically for SAR. FUSAR-GPT innovatively introduces a geospatial baseline model as a 'world knowledge' prior and embeds multi-source remote-sensing temporal features into the model's visual backbone via 'spatiotemporal anchors', enabling dynamic compensation for the sparse representation of targets in SAR images. Furthermore, we designed a two-stage SFT strategy to decouple the knowledge injection and task execution of large models. The spatiotemporal feature embedding and the two-stage decoupling paradigm enable FUSAR-GPT to achieve state-of-the-art performance across several typical remote sensing visual-language benchmark tests, significantly outperforming mainstream baseline models by over 12%.

Conclusion: ManiPT通过将提示调优限制在预训练流形上，有效缓解有限数据下的过拟合倾向，提高了小样本任务的泛化能力，并为理解提示调优的过拟合机制提供了理论视角。

Abstract: Prompt tuning introduces learnable prompt vectors that adapt pretrained vision-language models to downstream tasks in a parameter-efficient manner. However, under limited supervision, prompt tuning alters pretrained representations and drives downstream features away from the pretrained manifold toward directions that are unfavorable for transfer. This drift degrades generalization. To address this limitation, we propose ManiPT, a framework that performs prompt tuning on the pretrained manifold. ManiPT introduces cosine consistency constraints in both the text and image modalities to confine the learned representations within the pretrained geometric neighborhood. Furthermore, we introduce a structural bias that enforces incremental corrections, guiding the adaptation along transferable directions to mitigate reliance on shortcut learning. From a theoretical perspective, ManiPT alleviates overfitting tendencies under limited data. Our experiments cover four downstream settings: unseen-class generalization, few-shot classification, cross-dataset transfer, and domain generalization. Across these settings, ManiPT achieves higher average performance than baseline methods. Notably, ManiPT provides an explicit perspective on how prompt tuning overfits under limited supervision.

TL;DR: 利用预训练视频扩散模型的生成先验，从稀疏事件数据重构高保真视频帧，提升事件相机在静态纹理和空间信息方面的性能，并扩展到帧插值和预测任务


<details>

Motivation: 事件相机虽然擅长高速、低功耗和高动态范围感知，但只能记录相对强度变化而非绝对强度，导致空间信息和静态纹理细节严重丢失

Method: 首先建立基线模型，直接将事件数据作为条件合成视频；基于事件流与视频帧之间的物理相关性，引入事件驱动的帧间残差指导来提升重建精度；通过调制反向扩散采样过程，以零样本方式扩展到视频帧插值和预测任务

Conclusion: 通过引入事件驱动残差指导和调制扩散采样，构建了统一的事件到帧重建框架，有效解决了事件相机空间信息丢失的问题，并实现了帧插值和预测功能

Abstract: Event cameras excel at high-speed, low-power, and high-dynamic-range scene perception. However, as they fundamentally record only relative intensity changes rather than absolute intensity, the resulting data streams suffer from a significant loss of spatial information and static texture details. In this paper, we address this limitation by leveraging the generative prior of a pre-trained video diffusion model to reconstruct high-fidelity video frames from sparse event data. Specifically, we first establish a baseline model by directly applying event data as a condition to synthesize videos. Then, based on the physical correlation between the event stream and video frames, we further introduce the event-based inter-frame residual guidance to enhance the accuracy of video frame reconstruction. Furthermore, we extend our method to video frame interpolation and prediction in a zero-shot manner by modulating the reverse diffusion sampling process, thereby creating a unified event-to-frame reconstruction framework. Experimental results on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous approaches both quantitatively and qualitatively. We also refer the reviewers to the video demo contained in the supplementary material for video results. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/CS-GangXu/UniE2F.

Conclusion: GS-CLIP通过整合几何先验和多模态视觉理解，有效解决了零样本3D异常检测中的几何信息丢失和模态单一问题，为样本稀缺和数据隐私受限场景提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Zero-shot 3D Anomaly Detection is an emerging task that aims to detect anomalies in a target dataset without any target training data, which is particularly important in scenarios constrained by sample scarcity and data privacy concerns. While current methods adapt CLIP by projecting 3D point clouds into 2D representations, they face challenges. The projection inherently loses some geometric details, and the reliance on a single 2D modality provides an incomplete visual understanding, limiting their ability to detect diverse anomaly types. To address these limitations, we propose the Geometry-Aware Prompt and Synergistic View Representation Learning (GS-CLIP) framework, which enables the model to identify geometric anomalies through a two-stage learning process. In stage 1, we dynamically generate text prompts embedded with 3D geometric priors. These prompts contain global shape context and local defect information distilled by our Geometric Defect Distillation Module (GDDM). In stage 2, we introduce Synergistic View Representation Learning architecture that processes rendered and depth images in parallel. A Synergistic Refinement Module (SRM) subsequently fuses the features of both streams, capitalizing on their complementary strengths. Comprehensive experimental results on four large-scale public datasets show that GS-CLIP achieves superior performance in detection.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is vital for clinical diagnosis and quantitative analysis, yet remains challenging due to the heterogeneity of imaging modalities and the high cost of pixel-level annotations. Although general interactive segmentation models like SAM have achieved remarkable progress, their transfer to medical imaging still faces two key bottlenecks: (i) the lack of adaptive mechanisms for modality- and anatomy-specific tasks, which limits generalization in out-of-distribution medical scenarios; and (ii) current medical adaptation methods fine-tune on large, heterogeneous datasets without selection, leading to noisy supervision, higher cost, and negative transfer. To address these issues, we propose SegMoTE, an efficient and adaptive framework for medical image segmentation. SegMoTE preserves SAM's original prompt interface, efficient inference, and zero-shot generalization while introducing only a small number of learnable parameters to dynamically adapt across modalities and tasks. In addition, we design a progressive prompt tokenization mechanism that enables fully automatic segmentation, significantly reducing annotation dependence. Trained on MedSeg-HQ, a curated dataset less than 1% of existing large-scale datasets, SegMoTE achieves SOTA performance across diverse imaging modalities and anatomical tasks. It represents the first efficient, robust, and scalable adaptation of general segmentation models to the medical domain under extremely low annotation cost, advancing the practical deployment of foundation vision models in clinical applications.

Abstract: With the rapid development of remote sensing image archives, asking questions about images has become an effective way of gathering specific information or performing semantic image retrieval. However, current automatically generated questions tend to be simplistic and template-based, which hinders the deployment of question answering or visual dialogue systems for real-world applications. To enrich and diversify the questions with both image content and commonsense knowledge, we propose a Knowledge-aware Remote Sensing Visual Question Generation model (KRSVQG). The proposed model incorporates related knowledge triplets from external knowledge sources to broaden the question content, while employing image captioning as an intermediary representation to ground questions to the corresponding images. Moreover, KRSVQG utilizes a vision-language pre-training and fine-tuning strategy, enabling the model's adaptation to low data regimes. To evaluate the proposed KRSVQG model, we construct two knowledge-aware remote sensing visual question generation datasets: the NWPU-300 dataset and the TextRS-300 dataset. Evaluations, including metrics and human assessment, demonstrate that KRSVQG outperforms existing methods and leads to rich questions, grounded in both image and domain knowledge. As a key practice in vision-language research, knowledge-aware visual question generation advances the understanding of image content beyond pixels, facilitating the development of knowledge-enriched vision-language systems with vision-grounded human commonsense.

Abstract: Deep learning vision models excel with abundant supervision, but many applications face label scarcity and class imbalance. Controllable image editing can augment scarce labeled data, yet edits often introduce artifacts and entangle non-target attributes. We study this in facial expression analysis, targeting Action Unit (AU) manipulation where annotation is costly and AU co-activation drives entanglement. We present a facial manipulation method that operates in the semantic latent space of a pre-trained face generator (Diffusion Autoencoder). Using lightweight linear models, we reduce entanglement of semantic features via (i) dependency-aware conditioning that accounts for AU co-activation, and (ii) orthogonal projection that removes nuisance attribute directions (e.g., glasses), together with an expression neutralization step to enable absolute AU edit. We use these edits to balance AU occurrence by editing labeled faces and to diversify identities/demographics via controlled synthesis. Augmenting AU detector training with the generated data improves accuracy and yields more disentangled predictions with fewer co-activation shortcuts, outperforming alternative data-efficient training strategies and suggesting improvements similar to what would require substantially more labeled data in our learning-curve analysis. Compared to prior methods, our edits are stronger, produce fewer artifacts, and preserve identity better.

Abstract: The collection and detection of video anomaly data has long been a challenging problem due to its rare occurrence and spatio-temporal scarcity. Existing video anomaly detection (VAD) methods under perform in open-world scenarios. Key contributing factors include limited dataset diversity, and inadequate understanding of context-dependent anomalous semantics. To address these issues, i) we propose LAVIDA, an end-to-end zero-shot video anomaly detection framework. ii) LAVIDA employs an Anomaly Exposure Sampler that transforms segmented objects into pseudo-anomalies to enhance model adaptability to unseen anomaly categories. It further integrates a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to bolster semantic comprehension capabilities. Additionally, iii) we design a token compression approach based on reverse attention to handle the spatio-temporal scarcity of anomalous patterns and decrease computational cost. The training process is conducted solely on pseudo anomalies without any VAD data. Evaluations across four benchmark VAD datasets demonstrate that LAVIDA achieves SOTA performance in both frame-level and pixel-level anomaly detection under the zero-shot setting.

TL;DR: 提出了注意力监督扩散框架，通过将风格令牌注意力与物体掩码对齐实现无需掩码的精确局部风格迁移；使用Focus和Cover损失改进定位，采用LoRA-MoE支持多风格；提出区域风格编辑分数度量工具；在局部风格迁移任务上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 论文旨在解决基于扩散模型的风格迁移中精准空间控制的核心挑战。现有扩散模型将风格视为全局特征，缺乏对风格表示的空间接地标注，难以将风格应用限制在特定物体或区域。现有方法通常依赖手工制作的掩码或多阶段后处理，这些方法会产生边界伪影并限制泛化能力。

Method: 提出了一个注意力监督的扩散框架，通过在训练过程中将风格令牌的注意力分数与物体掩码对齐，明确教导模型在哪里应用给定风格。使用两个互补的损失目标：基于KL散度的Focus损失和基于二元交叉熵的Cover损失，共同促进精准定位和密集覆盖。同时采用了模块化的LoRA-MoE设计，以实现高效、可扩展的多风格适应。

Result: 引入区域风格编辑分数进行评估，该分数通过目标区域内基于CLIP的相似性来衡量区域风格匹配，并通过未编辑区域的掩码LPIPS和像素级一致性来衡量身份保持。实验表明，该方法在推理时实现了无需掩码的单物体风格迁移，产生区域准确且视觉一致的结果，超越了现有的基于扩散的编辑方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地解决了扩散风格迁移中的局部空间控制问题，通过注意力监督框架实现了精确的区域风格编辑，并在定量和定性评估中都取得了优异表现。

Abstract: Precise spatial control in diffusion-based style transfer remains challenging. This challenge arises because diffusion models treat style as a global feature and lack explicit spatial grounding of style representations, making it difficult to restrict style application to specific objects or regions. To our knowledge, existing diffusion models are unable to perform true localized style transfer, typically relying on handcrafted masks or multi-stage post-processing that introduce boundary artifacts and limit generalization. To address this, we propose an attention-supervised diffusion framework that explicitly teaches the model where to apply a given style by aligning the attention scores of style tokens with object masks during training. Two complementary objectives, a Focus loss based on KL divergence and a Cover loss using binary cross-entropy, jointly encourage accurate localization and dense coverage. A modular LoRA-MoE design further enables efficient and scalable multi-style adaptation. To evaluate localized stylization, we introduce the Regional Style Editing Score, which measures Regional Style Matching through CLIP-based similarity within the target region and Identity Preservation via masked LPIPS and pixel-level consistency on unedited areas. Experiments show that our method achieves mask-free, single-object style transfer at inference, producing regionally accurate and visually coherent results that outperform existing diffusion-based editing approaches.

Abstract: We introduce a gradient-free framework for identifying minimal, sufficient, and decision-preserving explanations in vision models by isolating the smallest subset of representational units whose joint activation preserves predictions. Unlike existing approaches that aggregate all units, often leading to cluttered saliency maps, our approach, DD-CAM, identifies a 1-minimal subset whose joint activation suffices to preserve the prediction (i.e., removing any unit from the subset alters the prediction). To efficiently isolate minimal sufficient subsets, we adapt delta debugging, a systematic reduction strategy from software debugging, and configure its search strategy based on unit interactions in the classifier head: testing individual units for models with non-interacting units and testing unit combinations for models in which unit interactions exist. We then generate minimal, prediction-preserving saliency maps that highlight only the most essential features. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach can produce more faithful explanations and achieve higher localization accuracy than the state-of-the-art CAM-based approaches.

Abstract: Industrial fruit inspection systems must operate reliably under dense multi-object interactions and continuous motion, yet most existing works evaluate detection or classification at the image level without ensuring temporal stability in video streams. We present a two-stage detection-tracking framework for stable multi-apple quality inspection in conveyor-belt environments. An orchard-trained YOLOv8 model performs apple localization, followed by ByteTrack multi-object tracking to maintain persistent identities. A ResNet18 defect classifier, fine-tuned on a healthy-defective fruit dataset, is applied to cropped apple regions. Track-level aggregation is introduced to enforce temporal consistency and reduce prediction oscillation across frames. We define video-level industrial metrics such as track-level defect ratio and temporal consistency to evaluate system robustness under realistic processing conditions. Results demonstrate improved stability compared to frame-wise inference, suggesting that integrating tracking is essential for practical automated fruit grading systems.

Conclusion: 通过结合空间和时间一致性约束，提出的STCL方法有效解决了MRI造影增强动力学模拟中的内容失真和时间不连续问题，为连续对比剂无造影动力学模拟提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Clinical MRI contrast acquisition suffers from inefficient information yield, which presents as a mismatch between the risky and costly acquisition protocol and the fixed and sparse acquisition sequence. Applying world models to simulate the contrast enhancement kinetics in the human body enables continuous contrast-free dynamics. However, the low temporal resolution in MRI acquisition restricts the training of world models, leading to a sparsely sampled dataset. Directly training a generative model to capture the kinetics leads to two limitations: (a) Due to the absence of data on missing time, the model tends to overfit to irrelevant features, leading to content distortion. (b) Due to the lack of continuous temporal supervision, the model fails to learn the continuous kinetics law over time, causing temporal discontinuities. For the first time, we propose MRI Contrast Enhancement Kinetics World model (MRI CEKWorld) with SpatioTemporal Consistency Learning (STCL). For (a), guided by the spatial law that patient-level structures remain consistent during enhancement, we propose Latent Alignment Learning (LAL) that constructs a patient-specific template to constrain contents to align with this template. For (b), guided by the temporal law that the kinetics follow a consistent smooth trend, we propose Latent Difference Learning (LDL) which extends the unobserved intervals by interpolation and constrains smooth variations in the latent space among interpolated sequences. Extensive experiments on two datasets show our MRI CEKWorld achieves better realistic contents and kinetics.

Abstract: The image purification strategy constructs an intermediate distribution with aligned anatomical structures, which effectively corrects the spatial misalignment between real-world ultra-low-dose CT and normal-dose CT images and significantly enhances the structural preservation ability of denoising models. However, this strategy exhibits two inherent limitations. First, it suppresses noise only in the chest wall and bone regions while leaving the image background untreated. Second, it lacks a dedicated mechanism for denoising the lung parenchyma. To address these issues, we systematically redesign the original image purification strategy and propose an improved version termed IPv2. The proposed strategy introduces three core modules, namely Remove Background, Add noise, and Remove noise. These modules endow the model with denoising capability in both background and lung tissue regions during training data construction and provide a more reasonable evaluation protocol through refined label construction at the testing stage. Extensive experiments on our previously established real-world patient lung CT dataset acquired at 2% radiation dose demonstrate that IPv2 consistently improves background suppression and lung parenchyma restoration across multiple mainstream denoising models. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/MonkeyDadLufy/Image-Purification-Strategy-v2.

Abstract: Unified Speech Recognition (USR) has emerged as a semi-supervised framework for training a single model for audio, visual, and audiovisual speech recognition, achieving state-of-the-art results on in-distribution benchmarks. However, its reliance on autoregressive pseudo-labelling makes training expensive, while its decoupled supervision of CTC and attention branches increases susceptibility to self-reinforcing errors, particularly under distribution shifts involving longer sequences, noise, or unseen domains. We propose CTC-driven teacher forcing, where greedily decoded CTC pseudo-labels are fed into the decoder to generate attention targets in a single forward pass. Although these can be globally incoherent, in the pseudo-labelling setting they enable efficient and effective knowledge transfer. Because CTC and CTC-driven attention pseudo-labels have the same length, the decoder can predict both simultaneously, benefiting from the robustness of CTC and the expressiveness of attention without costly beam search. We further propose mixed sampling to mitigate the exposure bias of the decoder relying solely on CTC inputs. The resulting method, USR 2.0, halves training time, improves robustness to out-of-distribution inputs, and achieves state-of-the-art results on LRS3, LRS2, and WildVSR, surpassing USR and modality-specific self-supervised baselines.

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for real-time and high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from posed images. However, recent studies reveal its vulnerability to adversarial corruptions in input views, where imperceptible yet consistent perturbations can drastically degrade rendering quality, increase training and rendering time, and inflate memory usage, even leading to server denial-of-service. In our work, to mitigate this issue, we begin by analyzing the distinct behaviors of adversarial perturbations in the low- and high-frequency components of input images using wavelet transforms. Based on this observation, we design a simple yet effective frequency-aware defense strategy that reconstructs training views by filtering high-frequency noise while preserving low-frequency content. This approach effectively suppresses adversarial artifacts while maintaining the authenticity of the original scene. Notably, it does not significantly impair training on clean data, achieving a desirable trade-off between robustness and performance on clean inputs. Through extensive experiments under a wide range of attack intensities on multiple benchmarks, we demonstrate that our method substantially enhances the robustness of 3DGS without access to clean ground-truth supervision. By highlighting and addressing the overlooked vulnerabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting, our work paves the way for more robust and secure 3D reconstructions.

Abstract: Early and accurate classification of retinal diseases is critical to counter vision loss and for guiding clinical management of retinal diseases. In this study, we proposed a deep learning method for retinal disease classification utilizing optical coherence tomography (OCT) images from the Retinal OCT Image Classification - C8 dataset (comprising 24,000 labeled images spanning eight conditions). Images were resized to 224x224 px and tested on convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures: Xception and InceptionV3. Data augmentation techniques (CutMix, MixUp) were employed to enhance model generalization. Additionally, we applied GradCAM and LIME for interpretability evaluation. We implemented this in a real-world scenario via our web application named RetinaVision. This study found that Xception was the most accurate network (95.25%), followed closely by InceptionV3 (94.82%). These results suggest that deep learning methods allow effective OCT retinal disease classification and highlight the importance of implementing accuracy and interpretability for clinical applications.

Abstract: Acquiring aligned visuo-tactile datasets is slow and costly, requiring specialised hardware and large-scale data collection. Synthetic generation is promising, but prior methods are typically single-modality, limiting cross-modal learning. We present MultiDiffSense, a unified diffusion model that synthesises images for multiple vision-based tactile sensors (ViTac, TacTip, ViTacTip) within a single architecture. Our approach uses dual conditioning on CAD-derived, pose-aligned depth maps and structured prompts that encode sensor type and 4-DoF contact pose, enabling controllable, physically consistent multi-modal synthesis. Evaluating on 8 objects (5 seen, 3 novel) and unseen poses, MultiDiffSense outperforms a Pix2Pix cGAN baseline in SSIM by +36.3% (ViTac), +134.6% (ViTacTip), and +64.7% (TacTip). For downstream 3-DoF pose estimation, mixing 50% synthetic with 50% real halves the required real data while maintaining competitive performance. MultiDiffSense alleviates the data-collection bottleneck in tactile sensing and enables scalable, controllable multi-modal dataset generation for robotic applications.

Method: 1. 将原始LiDAR数据投影到2D范围视角，用LiDAR编码器编码；摄像头特征同时提取并投影到同一共享空间。2. 核心为不确定性引导的融合模块，使用预测的不确定性图动态调制跨模态交互。3. 这些不确定性图通过量化不同视觉退化下的表示差异学习得到。4. 融合后的范围视角特征通过新颖的混合2D-3D变换器解码，缓解2D投影固有的空间歧义，直接预测3D全景分割掩码。

Result: 在Panoptic nuScenes、SemanticKITTI以及新引入的Panoptic Waymo基准测试上的大量实验证明了UP-Fuse的有效性和鲁棒性。即使在严重视觉损坏或错位的情况下，它仍能保持强劲性能。

Conclusion: UP-Fuse是一种适用于安全关键场景下机器人感知的鲁棒融合框架，能够在摄像机传感器退化、校准漂移和传感器失效时保持可靠的3D全景分割性能。

Abstract: LiDAR-camera fusion enhances 3D panoptic segmentation by leveraging camera images to complement sparse LiDAR scans, but it also introduces a critical failure mode. Under adverse conditions, degradation or failure of the camera sensor can significantly compromise the reliability of the perception system. To address this problem, we introduce UP-Fuse, a novel uncertainty-aware fusion framework in the 2D range-view that remains robust under camera sensor degradation, calibration drift, and sensor failure. Raw LiDAR data is first projected into the range-view and encoded by a LiDAR encoder, while camera features are simultaneously extracted and projected into the same shared space. At its core, UP-Fuse employs an uncertainty-guided fusion module that dynamically modulates cross-modal interaction using predicted uncertainty maps. These maps are learned by quantifying representational divergence under diverse visual degradations, ensuring that only reliable visual cues influence the fused representation. The fused range-view features are decoded by a novel hybrid 2D-3D transformer that mitigates spatial ambiguities inherent to the 2D projection and directly predicts 3D panoptic segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on Panoptic nuScenes, SemanticKITTI, and our introduced Panoptic Waymo benchmark demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of UP-Fuse, which maintains strong performance even under severe visual corruption or misalignment, making it well suited for robotic perception in safety-critical settings.

TL;DR: PoseCraft是一个基于扩散模型的框架，通过将稀疏的3D地标和相机外部参数编码为离散条件标记（而不是仅依赖光栅化的2D控制图像），将3D姿态和相机控制信息注入到扩散过程中，从而在保持3D语义精确性的前提下生成高质量的真人化身图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于蒙皮的工作流需手动绑定骨骼或依赖模板拟合、耗时耗力，而神经体素渲染方法则依赖规范化的模板，并需为每个未见过的姿态重构优化参数。现有方法在处理大姿态和视角变化时，由于2D重投影的模糊性，难以维持3D语义的精确性。因此需要一种能够在生成过程中直接注入3D姿态信息，保留3D语义信息，并生成高质量真人化身的生成模型。

Method: 提出了PoseCraft，一个以令牌化3D接口为核心的扩散框架。具体方法如下：
1. 编码稀疏的三维地标（landmarks）和相机外部参数（extrinsics）作为离散的条件标记（tokens）。
2. 通过交叉注意力（cross-attention）机制，将这些作为条件注入到扩散模型中，而不是依赖于二维重新投影的光栅化几何。
3. 避免了在大姿态和视角变化下的二维重投影模糊，从而保持3D语义的准确。
4. 为了大规模训练和评估，还实现了名为GenHumanRF的数据生成流程，用于从体素重建数据中渲染不同的监督信号。

Result: 实验结果表明，PoseCraft在感知质量上相较于其他基于扩散的方法有显著提升。同时，与最新的基于体素渲染的SOTA方法在指标上相当或更好，而且能更好地保留如织物、头发等细节。

Conclusion: PoseCraft将稀疏的3D地标和相机参数编码为离散token，并注入扩散过程来实现3D姿态和相机控制。该方法有效地解决了传统方法在处理大姿态和视角变化时的语义模糊问题，在生成真人的高质量图像上取得了出色的效果，尤其是在保留细节方面有优势，为VR、远程呈现和娱乐应用中的真人化身合成提供了有效的新方案。

Abstract: Digitizing humans and synthesizing photorealistic avatars with explicit 3D pose and camera controls are central to VR, telepresence, and entertainment. Existing skinning-based workflows require laborious manual rigging or template-based fittings, while neural volumetric methods rely on canonical templates and re-optimization for each unseen pose. We present PoseCraft, a diffusion framework built around tokenized 3D interface: instead of relying only on rasterized geometry as 2D control images, we encode sparse 3D landmarks and camera extrinsics as discrete conditioning tokens and inject them into diffusion via cross-attention. Our approach preserves 3D semantics by avoiding 2D re-projection ambiguity under large pose and viewpoint changes, and produces photorealistic imagery that faithfully captures identity and appearance. To train and evaluate at scale, we also implement GenHumanRF, a data generation workflow that renders diverse supervision from volumetric reconstructions. Our experiments show that PoseCraft achieves significant perceptual quality improvement over diffusion-centric methods, and attains better or comparable metrics to latest volumetric rendering SOTA while better preserving fabric and hair details.

Abstract: Spatial visualization is the mental ability to imagine, transform, and manipulate the spatial characteristics of objects and actions. This intelligence is a part of human cognition where actions and perception are connected on a mental level. To explore whether state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit this ability, we develop MentalBlackboard, an open-ended spatial visualization benchmark for Paper Folding and Hole Punching tests within two core tasks: prediction and planning. Our prediction experiments reveal that models struggle with applying symmetrical transformations, even when they predict the sequence of unfolding steps correctly. Also, rotations introduce a significant challenge to the physical situational awareness for models. The planning task reveals limitations of models in analyzing symmetrical relationships and in implementing the multi-stage symmetry process, with Claude Opus 4.1 achieving the highest planning score at an accuracy of 10\%. The top-performing model, o3, attains a peak performance of 71.6\% on the generalization task, which does not require spatial visualization but transfers spatial data; however, it achieves only 25\% accuracy on text-based prediction tasks.

Abstract: Precise, object-aware control over visual content is essential for advanced image editing and compositional generation. Yet, most existing approaches operate on entire images holistically, limiting the ability to isolate and manipulate individual scene elements. In contrast, layered representations, where scenes are explicitly separated into objects, environmental context, and visual effects, provide a more intuitive and structured framework for interpreting and editing visual content. To bridge this gap and enable both compositional understanding and controllable editing, we introduce the Referring Layer Decomposition (RLD) task, which predicts complete RGBA layers from a single RGB image, conditioned on flexible user prompts, such as spatial inputs (e.g., points, boxes, masks), natural language descriptions, or combinations thereof. At the core is the RefLade, a large-scale dataset comprising 1.11M image-layer-prompt triplets produced by our scalable data engine, along with 100K manually curated, high-fidelity layers. Coupled with a perceptually grounded, human-preference-aligned automatic evaluation protocol, RefLade establishes RLD as a well-defined and benchmarkable research task. Building on this foundation, we present RefLayer, a simple baseline designed for prompt-conditioned layer decomposition, achieving high visual fidelity and semantic alignment. Extensive experiments show our approach enables effective training, reliable evaluation, and high-quality image decomposition, while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization capabilities.

Motivation: 针对喉镜视频中因组织快速变形、遮挡和视觉模糊导致的声门开口定位时序稳定性难题，现有单帧检测器缺乏时序上下文，而基础模型跟踪器存在记忆漂移问题，临床应急场景亟需鲁棒的时序感知解决方案。

Method: 提出CL-MC（闭环内存校正）框架，通过置信度对齐的状态决策和主动内存校正机制，用高置信度检测结果监督SAM2跟踪器；当检测器输出高置信结果时触发语义重置，覆盖已损坏的跟踪器内存，在无需额外训练的情况下实现复杂内窥镜场景下的漂移抑制。

Conclusion: 内存校正是实现可靠临床视频跟踪的关键组件，CL-MC框架为内窥镜场景下的时序稳定目标跟踪提供了有效的训练免费解决方案。

Abstract: Temporal stability in glottic opening localization remains challenging due to the complementary weaknesses of single-frame detectors and foundation-model trackers: the former lacks temporal context, while the latter suffers from memory drift. Specifically, in video laryngoscopy, rapid tissue deformation, occlusions, and visual ambiguities in emergency settings require a robust, temporally aware solution that can prevent progressive tracking errors. We propose Closed-Loop Memory Correction (CL-MC), a detector-in-the-loop framework that supervises Segment Anything Model 2(SAM2) through confidence-aligned state decisions and active memory rectification. High-confidence detections trigger semantic resets that overwrite corrupted tracker memory, effectively mitigating drift accumulation with a training-free foundation tracker in complex endoscopic scenes. On emergency intubation videos, CL-MC achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing drift and missing rate compared with the SAM2 variants and open loop based methods. Our results establish memory correction as a crucial component for reliable clinical video tracking. Our code will be available in https://github.com/huayuww/CL-MR.

Conclusion: ADAMAB提供了一种高效且理论保证的少样本模式识别解决方案，成功解决了传统方法在数据稀缺和计算成本方面的限制。

Abstract: Recognizing implicit visual and textual patterns is essential in many real-world applications of modern AI. However, tackling long-tail pattern recognition tasks remains challenging for current pre-trained foundation models such as LLMs and VLMs. While finetuning pre-trained models can improve accuracy in recognizing implicit patterns, it is usually infeasible due to a lack of training data and high computational overhead. In this paper, we propose ADAMAB, an efficient embedding calibration framework for few-shot pattern recognition. To maximally reduce the computational costs, ADAMAB trains embedder-agnostic light-weight calibrators on top of fixed embedding models without accessing their parameters. To mitigate the need for large-scale training data, we introduce an adaptive data augmentation strategy based on the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) mechanism. With a modified upper confidence bound algorithm, ADAMAB diminishes the gradient shifting and offers theoretically guaranteed convergence in few-shot training. Our multi-modal experiments justify the superior performance of ADAMAB, with up to 40% accuracy improvement when training with less than 5 initial data samples of each class.

Abstract: U-Net architectures have been instrumental in advancing biomedical image segmentation (BIS) but often struggle with capturing long-range information. One reason is the conventional down-sampling techniques that prioritize computational efficiency at the expense of information retention. This paper introduces a simple but effective strategy, we call it Stair Pooling, which moderates the pace of down-sampling and reduces information loss by leveraging a sequence of concatenated small and narrow pooling operations in varied orientations. Specifically, our method modifies the reduction in dimensionality within each 2D pooling step from $\frac{1}{4}$ to $\frac{1}{2}$. This approach can also be adapted for 3D pooling to preserve even more information. Such preservation aids the U-Net in more effectively reconstructing spatial details during the up-sampling phase, thereby enhancing its ability to capture long-range information and improving segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments on three BIS benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed Stair Pooling can increase both 2D and 3D U-Net performance by an average of 3.8\% in Dice scores. Moreover, we leverage the transfer entropy to select the optimal down-sampling paths and quantitatively show how the proposed Stair Pooling reduces the information loss.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are foundational to modern multimodal applications, yet their susceptibility to adversarial attacks remains a critical concern. Prior white-box attacks rarely generalize across tasks, and black-box methods depend on expensive transfer, which limits efficiency. The vision encoder, standardized and often shared across LVLMs, provides a stable gray-box pivot with strong cross-model transfer. Building on this premise, we introduce PA-Attack (Prototype-Anchored Attentive Attack). PA-Attack begins with a prototype-anchored guidance that provides a stable attack direction towards a general and dissimilar prototype, tackling the attribute-restricted issue and limited task generalization of vanilla attacks. Building on this, we propose a two-stage attention enhancement mechanism: (i) leverage token-level attention scores to concentrate perturbations on critical visual tokens, and (ii) adaptively recalibrate attention weights to track the evolving attention during the adversarial process. Extensive experiments across diverse downstream tasks and LVLM architectures show that PA-Attack achieves an average 75.1% score reduction rate (SRR), demonstrating strong attack effectiveness, efficiency, and task generalization in LVLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/hefeimei06/PA-Attack.

Abstract: Domain adaptive segmentation (DAS) is a promising paradigm for delineating intracellular structures from various large-scale electron microscopy (EM) without incurring extensive annotated data in each domain. However, the prevalent unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) strategies often demonstrate limited and biased performance, which hinders their practical applications. In this study, we explore sparse points and local human preferences as weak labels in the target domain, thereby presenting a more realistic yet annotation-efficient setting. Specifically, we develop Prefer-DAS, which pioneers sparse promptable learning and local preference alignment. The Prefer-DAS is a promptable multitask model that integrates self-training and prompt-guided contrastive learning. Unlike SAM-like methods, the Prefer-DAS allows for the use of full, partial, and even no point prompts during both training and inference stages and thus enables interactive segmentation. Instead of using image-level human preference alignment for segmentation, we introduce Local direct Preference Optimization (LPO) and sparse LPO (SLPO), plug-and-play solutions for alignment with spatially varying human feedback or sparse feedback. To address potential missing feedback, we also introduce Unsupervised Preference Optimization (UPO), which leverages self-learned preferences. As a result, the Prefer-DAS model can effectively perform both weakly-supervised and unsupervised DAS, depending on the availability of points and human preferences. Comprehensive experiments on four challenging DAS tasks demonstrate that our model outperforms SAM-like methods as well as unsupervised and weakly-supervised DAS methods in both automatic and interactive segmentation modes, highlighting strong generalizability and flexibility. Additionally, the performance of our model is very close to or even exceeds that of supervised models.

Abstract: Hepatocellular Carcinoma diagnosis relies heavily on the interpretation of gigapixel Whole Slide Images. However, current computational approaches are constrained by fixed-resolution processing mechanisms and inefficient feature aggregation, which inevitably lead to either severe information loss or high feature redundancy. To address these challenges, we propose Hepato-LLaVA, a specialized Multi-modal Large Language Model designed for fine-grained hepatocellular pathology analysis. We introduce a novel Sparse Topo-Pack Attention mechanism that explicitly models 2D tissue topology. This mechanism effectively aggregates local diagnostic evidence into semantic summary tokens while preserving global context. Furthermore, to overcome the lack of multi-scale data, we present HepatoPathoVQA, a clinically grounded dataset comprising 33K hierarchically structured question-answer pairs validated by expert pathologists. Our experiments demonstrate that Hepato-LLaVA achieves state-of-the-art performance on HCC diagnosis and captioning tasks, significantly outperforming existing methods.

Abstract: Despite the inherent advantages of thermal infrared(TIR) imaging, large-scale data collection and annotation remain a major bottleneck for TIR-based perception. A practical alternative is to synthesize pseudo TIR data via image translation; however, most RGB-to-TIR approaches heavily rely on RGB-centric priors that overlook thermal physics, yielding implausible heat distributions. In this paper, we introduce TherA, a controllable RGB-to-TIR translation framework that produces diverse and thermally plausible images at both scene and object level. TherA couples TherA-VLM with a latent-diffusion-based translator. Given a single RGB image and a user-prompted condition pair, TherA-VLM yields a thermal-aware embedding that encodes scene, object, material, and heat-emission context reflecting the input scene-condition pair. Conditioning the diffusion model on this embedding enables realistic TIR synthesis and fine-grained control across time of day, weather, and object state. Compared to other baselines, TherA achieves state-of-the-art translation performance, demonstrating improved zero-shot translation performance up to 33% increase averaged across all metrics.

Abstract: This paper presents CountEx, a discriminative visual counting framework designed to address a key limitation of existing prompt-based methods: the inability to explicitly exclude visually similar distractors. While current approaches allow users to specify what to count via inclusion prompts, they often struggle in cluttered scenes with confusable object categories, leading to ambiguity and overcounting. CountEx enables users to express both inclusion and exclusion intent, specifying what to count and what to ignore, through multimodal prompts including natural language descriptions and optional visual exemplars. At the core of CountEx is a novel Discriminative Query Refinement module, which jointly reasons over inclusion and exclusion cues by first identifying shared visual features, then isolating exclusion-specific patterns, and finally applying selective suppression to refine the counting query. To support systematic evaluation of fine-grained counting methods, we introduce CoCount, a benchmark comprising 1,780 videos and 10,086 annotated frames across 97 category pairs. Experiments show that CountEx achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods for counting objects from both known and novel categories.

Abstract: Underwater fish detection (UFD) is a core capability for smart aquaculture and marine ecological monitoring. While recent detectors improve accuracy by stacking feature extractors or introducing heavy attention modules, they often incur substantial computational overhead and, more importantly, neglect the physics that fundamentally limits UFD: wavelength-dependent absorption and turbidity-induced scattering significantly degrade contrast, blur fine structures, and introduce backscattering noise, leading to unreliable localization and recognition. To address these challenges, we propose FinSight-Net, an efficient and physics-aware detection framework tailored for complex aquaculture environments. FinSight-Net introduces a Multi-Scale Decoupled Dual-Stream Processing (MS-DDSP) bottleneck that explicitly targets frequency-specific information loss via heterogeneous convolutional branches, suppressing backscattering artifacts while compensating distorted biological cues through scale-aware and channel-weighted pathways. We further design an Efficient Path Aggregation FPN (EPA-FPN) as a detail-filling mechanism: it restores high-frequency spatial information typically attenuated in deep layers by establishing long-range skip connections and pruning redundant fusion routes, enabling robust detection of non-rigid fish targets under severe blur and turbidity. Extensive experiments on DeepFish, AquaFishSet, and our challenging UW-BlurredFish benchmark demonstrate that FinSight-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance. In particular, on UW-BlurredFish, FinSight-Net reaches 92.8% mAP, outperforming YOLOv11s by 4.8% while reducing parameters by 29.0%, providing a strong and lightweight solution for real-time automated monitoring in smart aquaculture.

Abstract: Aligning vision-language model (VLM) outputs with human preferences in domain-specific tasks typically requires fine-tuning or reinforcement learning, both of which demand labelled data and GPU compute. We show that for subjective perception tasks, this alignment can be achieved without any model training: VLMs are already strong concept extractors but poor decision calibrators, and the gap can be closed externally. We propose a training-free post-hoc concept-bottleneck pipeline consisting of three tightly coupled stages: concept mining, multi-agent structured scoring, and geometric calibration, unified by an end-to-end dimension optimization loop. Interpretable evaluation dimensions are mined from a handful of human annotations; an Observer-Debater-Judge chain extracts robust continuous concept scores from a frozen VLM; and locally-weighted ridge regression on a hybrid visual-semantic manifold calibrates these scores against human ratings. Applied to urban perception as UrbanAlign, the framework achieves 72.2% accuracy ($κ=0.45$) on Place Pulse 2.0 across six categories, outperforming the best supervised baseline by +15.1 pp and uncalibrated VLM scoring by +16.3 pp, with full dimension-level interpretability and zero model-weight modification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在专业视觉任务（如医学图像诊断、细粒度分类）中表现不佳，因为视觉编码器产生的表示误差会通过语言模型级联传播。现有适应方法需要调整编码器与语言模型之间的连续特征接口，导致组件耦合且需要重新对齐。需要一种解耦的轻量级适应方法，能在不修改模型其他部分的情况下提升领域特定表现。

Method: CRAFT（Codebook RegulAted Fine-Tuning）方法通过离散码本微调视觉编码器：为视觉表示分配稳定令牌空间；解耦的架构设计；无需修改语言模型部分；保持语言能力。

Result: 在VQARAD和PlantVillage等10个领域特定基准测试中平均提升13.51%；适应后的编码器可与不同语言架构的LVLMs无缝配合；性能优于连续令牌方法。

Conclusion: CRAFT提供了一种轻量级、解耦的视觉编码器微调方法，通过离散码本机制有效提升LVLMs在专业视觉任务上的表现，同时保持模型的语言能力，具有更好的扩展性和兼容性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) use their vision encoders to translate images into representations for downstream reasoning, but the encoders often underperform in domain-specific visual tasks such as medical image diagnosis or fine-grained classification, where representation errors can cascade through the language model, leading to incorrect responses. Existing adaptation methods modify the continuous feature interface between encoder and language model through projector tuning or other parameter-efficient updates, which still couples the two components and requires re-alignment whenever the encoder changes. We introduce CRAFT (Codebook RegulAted Fine-Tuning), a lightweight method that fine-tunes the encoder using a discrete codebook that anchors visual representations to a stable token space, achieving domain adaptation without modifying other parts of the model. This decoupled design allows the adapted encoder to seamlessly boost the performance of LVLMs with different language architectures, as long as they share the same codebook. Empirically, CRAFT achieves an average gain of 13.51% across 10 domain-specific benchmarks such as VQARAD and PlantVillage, while preserving the LLM's linguistic capabilities and outperforming peer methods that operate on continuous tokens.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Standard Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods typically treat inference as a blind optimization task, applying generic objectives to all or filtered test samples. In safety-critical medical segmentation, this lack of selectivity often causes the tumor mask to spill into healthy brain tissue or degrades predictions that were already correct. We propose Hypothesis-Driven TTA, a novel framework that reformulates adaptation as a dynamic decision process. Rather than forcing a single optimization trajectory, our method generates intuitive competing geometric hypotheses: compaction (is the prediction noisy? trim artifacts) versus inflation (is the valid tumor under-segmented? safely inflate to recover). It then employs a representation-guided selector to autonomously identify the safest outcome based on intrinsic texture consistency. Additionally, a pre-screening Gatekeeper prevents negative transfer by skipping adaptation on confident cases. We validate this proof-of-concept on a cross-domain binary brain tumor segmentation task, applying a source model trained on adult BraTS gliomas to unseen pediatric and more challenging meningioma target domains. HD-TTA improves safety-oriented outcomes (Hausdorff Distance (HD95) and Precision) over several state-of-the-art representative baselines in the challenging safety regime, reducing the HD95 by approximately 6.4 mm and improving Precision by over 4%, while maintaining comparable Dice scores. These results demonstrate that resolving the safety-adaptation trade-off via explicit hypothesis selection is a viable, robust path for safe clinical model deployment. Code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LapFlow是一个新颖的多尺度流匹配框架，通过拉普拉斯金字塔残差分解和并行处理不同尺度来提高图像生成质量，同时加速采样过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多尺度方法需要显式的重噪声处理（bridging process），这增加了计算成本。作者希望开发一个并行生成多尺度表示的框架，既能提升生成质量，又能提高采样效率。

Method: 使用拉普拉斯金字塔将图像分解为多尺度残差，通过具有因果注意力机制的混合变换器（MoT）架构并行处理不同尺度，消除了级联方法中需要的显式重噪声过程。

Result: 在CelebA-HQ和ImageNet上，LapFlow以更少的GFLOPs和更快的推理速度获得了比单尺度和多尺度基线更好的生成质量。该方法能有效扩展到1024×1024高分辨率，同时保持较低计算开销。

Conclusion: LapFlow通过并行多尺度处理增强了流匹配方法，既提高了生成质量又加速了采样过程，为流匹配方法的高效扩展提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we present Laplacian multiscale flow matching (LapFlow), a novel framework that enhances flow matching by leveraging multi-scale representations for image generative modeling. Our approach decomposes images into Laplacian pyramid residuals and processes different scales in parallel through a mixture-of-transformers (MoT) architecture with causal attention mechanisms. Unlike previous cascaded approaches that require explicit renoising between scales, our model generates multi-scale representations in parallel, eliminating the need for bridging processes. The proposed multi-scale architecture not only improves generation quality but also accelerates the sampling process and promotes scaling flow matching methods. Through extensive experimentation on CelebA-HQ and ImageNet, we demonstrate that our method achieves superior sample quality with fewer GFLOPs and faster inference compared to single-scale and multi-scale flow matching baselines. The proposed model scales effectively to high-resolution generation (up to 1024$\times$1024) while maintaining lower computational overhead.

Abstract: 3D imaging of specular surfaces remains challenging in real-world scenarios, such as in-line inspection or hand-held scanning, requiring fast and accurate measurement of complex geometries. Optical metrology techniques such as deflectometry achieve high accuracy but typically rely on multi-shot acquisition, making them unsuitable for dynamic environments. Fourier-based single-shot approaches alleviate this constraint, yet their performance deteriorates when measuring surfaces with high spatial frequency structure or large curvature. Alternatively, polarimetric 3D imaging in computer vision operates in a single-shot fashion and exhibits robustness to geometric complexity. However, its accuracy is fundamentally limited by the orthographic imaging assumption. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed deep learning framework for single-shot 3D imaging of complex specular surfaces. Polarization cues provide orientation priors that assist in interpreting geometric information encoded by structured illumination. These complementary cues are processed through a dual-encoder architecture with mutual feature modulation, allowing the network to resolve their nonlinear coupling and directly infer surface normals. The proposed method achieves accurate and robust normal estimation in single-shot with fast inference, enabling practical 3D imaging of complex specular surfaces.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了现有方法中的关键问题，通过抗遗忘设计和病灶感知机制，在无源域自适应任务上取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a model trained in the source domain to perform well in the target domain, with only unlabeled target domain data and the source model. Taking into account that conventional SFDA methods are inevitably error-prone under domain shift, recently greater attention has been directed to SFDA assisted with off-the-shelf foundation models, e.g., vision-language (ViL) models. However, existing works of leveraging ViL models for SFDA confront two issues: (i) Although mutual information is exploited to consider the joint distribution between the predictions of ViL model and the target model, we argue that the forgetting of some superior predictions of the target model still occurs, as indicated by the decline of the accuracies of certain classes during adaptation; (ii) Prior research disregards the rich, fine-grained knowledge embedded in the ViL model, which offers detailed grounding for fundus image diagnosis. In this paper, we introduce a novel forgetting-resistant and lesion-aware (FRLA) method for SFDA of fundus image diagnosis with ViL model. Specifically, a forgetting-resistant adaptation module explicitly preserves the confident predictions of the target model, and a lesion-aware adaptation module yields patch-wise predictions from ViL model and employs them to help the target model be aware of the lesion areas and leverage the ViL model's fine-grained knowledge. Extensive experiments show that our method not only significantly outperforms the vision-language model, but also achieves consistent improvements over the state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be released.

Conclusion: 该研究为全切片图像分析提供了一种有前景的方向，通过空间正则化有效缓解MIL中的稀疏监督问题。

Abstract: Whole slide images, with their gigapixel-scale panoramas of tissue samples, are pivotal for precise disease diagnosis. However, their analysis is hindered by immense data size and scarce annotations. Existing MIL methods face challenges due to the fundamental imbalance where a single bag-level label must guide the learning of numerous patch-level features. This sparse supervision makes it difficult to reliably identify discriminative patches during training, leading to unstable optimization and suboptimal solutions. We propose a spatially regularized MIL framework that leverages inherent spatial relationships among patch features as label-independent regularization signals. Our approach learns a shared representation space by jointly optimizing feature-induced spatial reconstruction and label-guided classification objectives, enforcing consistency between intrinsic structural patterns and supervisory signals. Experimental results on multiple public datasets demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods, offering a promising direction.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have enabled remarkable image understanding and generation capabilities. However, while models like Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image show emerging abilities to reason over multiple related images, existing benchmarks rarely address the challenges of multi-image context generation, focusing mainly on text-to-image or single-image editing tasks. In this work, we introduce \textbf{MICON-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark covering six tasks that evaluate cross-image composition, contextual reasoning, and identity preservation. We further propose an MLLM-driven Evaluation-by-Checkpoint framework for automatic verification of semantic and visual consistency, where multimodal large language model (MLLM) serves as a verifier. Additionally, we present \textbf{Dynamic Attention Rebalancing (DAR)}, a training-free, plug-and-play mechanism that dynamically adjusts attention during inference to enhance coherence and reduce hallucinations. Extensive experiments on various state-of-the-art open-source models demonstrate both the rigor of MICON-Bench in exposing multi-image reasoning challenges and the efficacy of DAR in improving generation quality and cross-image coherence.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在细粒度区域视觉推理方面通常需要重新训练或微调，缺乏灵活的实时适应能力。作者观察到跨模态注意力图本质上编码了文本标记和视觉区域的语义对应关系，因此提出通过优化视觉标记来引导模型注意力，无需更改模型参数。

Method: ControlMLLM++是一个测试时适应框架，通过对冻结的MLLM注入可学习的视觉提示来实现区域视觉推理。方法包括：1）通过任务特定的能量函数在推理过程中优化潜在视觉标记修饰器；2）改进的优化策略（Optim++）增强稳定性；3）提示去偏机制（PromptDebias）减少语言提示偏差；支持边界框、掩码、涂鸦、点等多种视觉提示类型。

Conclusion: ControlMLLM++通过优化视觉标记来引导模型注意力，实现了高效的细粒度区域视觉推理，具有良好的泛化性和可解释性，为MLLM的区域理解提供了新思路。

Abstract: We propose ControlMLLM++, a novel test-time adaptation framework that injects learnable visual prompts into frozen multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to enable fine-grained region-based visual reasoning without any model retraining or fine-tuning. Leveraging the insight that cross-modal attention maps intrinsically encode semantic correspondences between textual tokens and visual regions, ControlMLLM++ optimizes a latent visual token modifier during inference via a task-specific energy function to steer model attention towards user-specified areas. To enhance optimization stability and mitigate language prompt biases, ControlMLLM++ incorporates an improved optimization strategy (Optim++) and a prompt debiasing mechanism (PromptDebias). Supporting diverse visual prompt types including bounding boxes, masks, scribbles, and points, our method demonstrates strong out-of-domain generalization and interpretability.

Motivation: 现有基于时间外推的特征缓存方法因输出特征变化幅度不规则导致预测误差较大，影响性能

Method: 引入关系特征估计（RFE）从输入特征估算输出特征变化幅度，并提出关系缓存调度（RCS）基于输入特征估计误差并决定何时执行完整计算

Result: 在各种扩散变换器模型上的实验表明RFC显著优于先前方法

Conclusion: 通过利用模块输入与输出的强相关性，RFC框架能够更准确地预测特征，显著提升缓存效率

Abstract: Feature caching approaches accelerate diffusion transformers (DiTs) by storing the output features of computationally expensive modules at certain timesteps, and exploiting them for subsequent steps to reduce redundant computations. Recent forecasting-based caching approaches employ temporal extrapolation techniques to approximate the output features with cached ones. Although effective, relying exclusively on temporal extrapolation still suffers from significant prediction errors, leading to performance degradation. Through a detailed analysis, we find that 1) these errors stem from the irregular magnitude of changes in the output features, and 2) an input feature of a module is strongly correlated with the corresponding output. Based on this, we propose relational feature caching (RFC), a novel framework that leverages the input-output relationship to enhance the accuracy of the feature prediction. Specifically, we introduce relational feature estimation (RFE) to estimate the magnitude of changes in the output features from the inputs, enabling more accurate feature predictions. We also present relational cache scheduling (RCS), which estimates the prediction errors using the input features and performs full computations only when the errors are expected to be substantial. Extensive experiments across various DiT models demonstrate that RFC consistently outperforms prior approaches significantly. Project page is available at https://cvlab.yonsei.ac.kr/projects/RFC

Abstract: Generative image composition aims to regenerate the given foreground object in the background image to produce a realistic composite image. Some high-authenticity methods can adjust foreground pose/view to be compatible with background, while some high-fidelity methods can preserve the foreground details accurately. However, existing methods can hardly achieve both goals at the same time. In this work, we propose a two-stage strategy to achieve both goals. In the first stage, we use high-authenticity method to generate reasonable foreground shape, serving as the condition of high-fidelity method in the second stage. The experiments on MureCOM dataset verify the effectiveness of our two-stage strategy. The code and model have been released at https://github.com/bcmi/OSInsert-Image-Composition.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalization across diverse tasks, yet their performance remains constrained by the quality and geometry of the textual prototypes used to represent classes. Standard zero shot classifiers, derived from frozen text encoders and handcrafted prompts, may yield correlated or weakly separated embeddings that limit task specific discriminability. We introduce ORION, a text encoder fine tuning framework that improves pretrained VLMs using only class names. Our method optimizes, via low rank adaptation, a novel loss integrating two terms, one promoting pairwise orthogonality between the textual representations of the classes of a given task and the other penalizing deviations from the initial class prototypes. Furthermore, we provide a probabilistic interpretation of our orthogonality penalty, connecting it to the general maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) principle via Huygens theorem. We report extensive experiments on 11 benchmarks and three large VLM backbones, showing that the refined textual embeddings yield powerful replacements for the standard CLIP prototypes. Added as plug and play module on top of various state of the art methods, and across different prediction settings (zero shot, few shot and test time adaptation), ORION improves the performance consistently and significantly.

Motivation: 现有Mamba-based方法对整个非空体素序列进行双向编码，包含大量无用背景信息，而仅编码前景体素会因响应衰减和上下文表示受限导致性能下降

Method: 提出Fore-Mamba3D：1) 根据预测分数采样前景体素；2) 设计区域到全局滑动窗口(RGSW)在实例间传播信息；3) 提出语义辅助状态空间融合模块(SASFMamba)增强语义和几何感知

Conclusion: Fore-Mamba3D通过前景增强编码，缓解线性自回归模型中的距离依赖性和因果依赖性，为3D物体检测提供有效解决方案

Abstract: Linear modeling methods like Mamba have been merged as the effective backbone for the 3D object detection task. However, previous Mamba-based methods utilize the bidirectional encoding for the whole non-empty voxel sequence, which contains abundant useless background information in the scenes. Though directly encoding foreground voxels appears to be a plausible solution, it tends to degrade detection performance. We attribute this to the response attenuation and restricted context representation in the linear modeling for fore-only sequences. To address this problem, we propose a novel backbone, termed Fore-Mamba3D, to focus on the foreground enhancement by modifying Mamba-based encoder. The foreground voxels are first sampled according to the predicted scores. Considering the response attenuation existing in the interaction of foreground voxels across different instances, we design a regional-to-global slide window (RGSW) to propagate the information from regional split to the entire sequence. Furthermore, a semantic-assisted and state spatial fusion module (SASFMamba) is proposed to enrich contextual representation by enhancing semantic and geometric awareness within the Mamba model. Our method emphasizes foreground-only encoding and alleviates the distance-based and causal dependencies in the linear autoregression model. The superior performance across various benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of Fore-Mamba3D in the 3D object detection task.

Motivation: 现有年龄估计系统被广泛用于限制未成年人访问在线内容，但其对化妆品修饰等简单物理攻击的鲁棒性尚未得到系统评估。研究者希望探索家庭可实现的化妆品改变是否会导致AI模型将未成年人误判为成年人，从而暴露年龄验证系统的安全风险。

Method: 使用VLM图像编辑器（Gemini 2.5 Flash Image）对329张10-21岁个体面部图像进行四种化妆品攻击模拟：胡子、白发、化妆、模拟皱纹。评估8个模型：5个专用架构（MiVOLO、Custom-Best、Herosan、MiViaLab、DEX）和3个视觉语言模型（Gemini 3 Flash、Gemini 2.5 Flash、GPT-5-Nano）。引入攻击转化率（ACR）作为评估指标，即基线被预测为未成年人的图像在攻击后翻转为成年人的比例。

Result: 仅合成胡子就能在所有8个模型上实现28-69%的ACR；结合四种攻击可使预测年龄平均增加7.7岁，ACR最高达83%；视觉语言模型的ACR（59-71%）低于专用模型（63-83%），但差距未达统计显著性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了部署的年龄验证流程存在重大漏洞，表明对抗鲁棒性评估应成为模型选择的强制性标准，以防范化妆品修饰等简单物理攻击带来的安全风险。

Abstract: Age estimation systems are increasingly deployed as gatekeepers for age-restricted online content, yet their robustness to cosmetic modifications has not been systematically evaluated. We investigate whether simple, household-accessible cosmetic changes, including beards, grey hair, makeup, and simulated wrinkles, can cause AI age estimators to classify minors as adults. To study this threat at scale without ethical concerns, we simulate these physical attacks on 329 facial images of individuals aged 10 to 21 using a VLM image editor (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image). We then evaluate eight models from our prior benchmark: five specialized architectures (MiVOLO, Custom-Best, Herosan, MiViaLab, DEX) and three vision-language models (Gemini 3 Flash, Gemini 2.5 Flash, GPT-5-Nano). We introduce the Attack Conversion Rate (ACR), defined as the fraction of images predicted as minor at baseline that flip to adult after attack, a population-agnostic metric that does not depend on the ratio of minors to adults in the test set. Our results reveal that a synthetic beard alone achieves 28 to 69 percent ACR across all eight models; combining all four attacks shifts predicted age by +7.7 years on average across all 329 subjects and reaches up to 83 percent ACR; and vision-language models exhibit lower ACR (59 to 71 percent) than specialized models (63 to 83 percent) under the full attack, although the ACR ranges overlap and the difference is not statistically tested. These findings highlight a critical vulnerability in deployed age-verification pipelines and call for adversarial robustness evaluation as a mandatory criterion for model selection.

Deep learning (DL) methods have been developed to solve this problem. We examine an alternative solution using the Green Learning (GL) methodology. The new restoration method is characterized by mathematical transparency, computational and memory efficiency, and high performance. Experiments show that our GL method offers state-of-the-art restoration performance at a smaller model size and with lower inference complexity.

Abstract: Articulated object pose estimation is a core task in embodied AI. Existing methods typically regress poses in a continuous space, but often struggle with 1) navigating a large, complex search space and 2) failing to incorporate intrinsic kinematic constraints. In this work, we introduce DICArt (DIsCrete Diffusion for Articulation Pose Estimation), a novel framework that formulates pose estimation as a conditional discrete diffusion process. Instead of operating in a continuous domain, DICArt progressively denoises a noisy pose representation through a learned reverse diffusion procedure to recover the GT pose. To improve modeling fidelity, we propose a flexible flow decider that dynamically determines whether each token should be denoised or reset, effectively balancing the real and noise distributions during diffusion. Additionally, we incorporate a hierarchical kinematic coupling strategy, estimating the pose of each rigid part hierarchically to respect the object's kinematic structure. We validate DICArt on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance and robustness. By integrating discrete generative modeling with structural priors, DICArt offers a new paradigm for reliable category-level 6D pose estimation in complex environments.

Motivation: 大型视觉-语言模型容易受到对抗性图像的攻击，这些攻击会微妙地使模型的输出偏向看似合理但实际错误的响应。需要一种通用、高效且无需训练的防御方法来保护模型免受此类攻击。

Method: 采用两阶段检测机制：首先通过内容保留的图像变换快速过滤大多数干净输入；对于困难案例，在文本嵌入空间中检查差异；必要时使用强大的LLM解决由攻击引起的分歧。核心思想是通过整合多个响应来利用它们的相似性和差异性。

Result: 该方法在保持较高准确性的同时显著提升了效率：大多数干净图像无需昂贵的处理过程，即使在存在大量对抗样本的情况下，计算开销也保持在最低水平，实现了SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为LVLMs对抗攻击提供了一种实用且高效的防御方案，既保护了模型输出准确性，又确保了计算效率，具有良好的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can be vulnerable to adversarial images that subtly bias their outputs toward plausible yet incorrect responses. We introduce a general, efficient, and training-free defense that combines image transformations with agentic data consolidation to recover correct model behavior. A key component of our approach is a two-stage detection mechanism that quickly filters out the majority of clean inputs. We first assess image consistency under content-preserving transformations at negligible computational cost. For more challenging cases, we examine discrepancies in a text-embedding space. Only when necessary do we invoke a powerful LLM to resolve attack-induced divergences. A key idea is to consolidate multiple responses, leveraging both their similarities and their differences. We show that our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining notable efficiency: most clean images skip costly processing, and even in the presence of numerous adversarial examples, the overhead remains minimal.

Abstract: Video-LLMs have improved steadily on semantic perception, but they still fall short on predictive world modeling, which is central to physically grounded intelligence. We introduce HOCA-Bench, a benchmark that frames physical anomalies through a Hegelian lens. HOCA-Bench separates anomalies into two types: ontological anomalies, where an entity violates its own definition or persistence, and causal anomalies, where interactions violate physical relations. Using state-of-the-art generative video models as adversarial simulators, we build a testbed of 1,439 videos (3,470 QA pairs). Evaluations on 17 Video-LLMs show a clear cognitive lag: models often identify static ontological violations (e.g., shape mutations) but struggle with causal mechanisms (e.g., gravity or friction), with performance dropping by more than 20% on causal tasks. System-2 "Thinking" modes improve reasoning, but they do not close the gap, suggesting that current architectures recognize visual patterns more readily than they apply basic physical laws.

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation suffers from concept entanglement, where irrelevant residual information from reference images is captured, leading to a trade-off between concept fidelity and text alignment. Recent disentanglement approaches attempt to solve this utilizing manual guidance, such as linguistic cues or segmentation masks, which limits their applicability and fails to fully articulate the target concept. In this paper, we propose ConceptPrism, a novel framework that automatically disentangles the shared visual concept from image-specific residuals by comparing images within a set. Our method jointly optimizes a target token and image-wise residual tokens using two complementary objectives: a reconstruction loss to ensure fidelity, and a novel exclusion loss that compels residual tokens to discard the shared concept. This process allows the target token to capture the pure concept without direct supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConceptPrism effectively resolves concept entanglement, achieving a significantly improved trade-off between fidelity and alignment.

TL;DR: 本文提出MVIG攻击框架，通过构建互视图信息图来学习防御型协作感知系统的脆弱性知识，实施自适应对抗攻击，显著降低现有防御的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有协作感知系统的防御机制存在两大弱点：1)对具有系统化时序和目标区域优化的攻击缺乏鲁棒性；2)共享协作数据中的隐式置信度信息可能泄露系统脆弱性知识，导致防御容易被绕过。

Method: 提出MVIG攻击框架：1)构建统一的互视图信息图表示不同防御型协作感知系统；2)结合时序图学习生成动态伪造风险图；3)采用熵感知脆弱性搜索优化攻击位置、时序和持续性，实现跨多种防御配置的自适应攻击。

Result: 在OPV2V和Adv-OPV2V数据集上的评估表明：MVIG攻击能将最先进防御的成功率降低62%；对持续性攻击的检测率降低47%；攻击速度达到29.9 FPS，暴露了协作感知系统的关键安全漏洞。

Conclusion: MVIG攻击框架有效地利用了防御型协作感知系统中泄露的脆弱性知识，实现了高度自适应的对抗攻击，显著削弱了现有防御机制的有效性，揭示了当前协作感知安全防护的重要缺陷。

Abstract: Collaborative perception (CP) enables data sharing among connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) to enhance driving safety. However, CP systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks where malicious agents forge false objects via feature-level perturbations. Current defensive systems use threshold-based consensus verification by comparing collaborative and ego detection results. Yet, these defenses remain vulnerable to more sophisticated attack strategies that could exploit two critical weaknesses: (i) lack of robustness against attacks with systematic timing and target region optimization, and (ii) inadvertent disclosure of vulnerability knowledge through implicit confidence information in shared collaboration data. In this paper, we propose MVIG attack, a novel adaptive adversarial CP framework learning to capture vulnerability knowledge disclosed by different defensive CP systems from a unified mutual view information graph (MVIG) representation. Our approach combines MVIG representation with temporal graph learning to generate evolving fabrication risk maps and employs entropy-aware vulnerability search to optimize attack location, timing and persistence, enabling adaptive attacks with generalizability across various defensive configurations. Extensive evaluations on OPV2V and Adv-OPV2V datasets demonstrate that MVIG attack reduces defense success rates by up to 62\% against state-of-the-art defenses while achieving 47\% lower detection for persistent attacks at 29.9 FPS, exposing critical security gaps in CP systems.

TL;DR: CLCR是一种多模态学习新方法，通过构建语义层次结构与层级约束机制来改善模态融合效果，在多个跨模态任务上表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态学习方法将所有模态投影到单一潜在空间进行融合，忽略了多模态数据的异步、多层次语义结构，导致语义错位和误差传播，影响了表示质量

Method: 提出跨层级共表示框架(CLCR)：1) 语义层次编码器将各模态特征组织为浅层、中层、深层三层语义层次；2) 每层内部使用IntraCED将特征分解为共享和私有子空间，并通过可学习令牌预算将跨模态注意力限制在共享子空间；3) InterCAD同步语义尺度，选择性融合共享表示并门控私有线索，形成紧凑任务表示；4) 引入正则化项强制共享/私有特征分离并最小化跨层级干扰

Result: 在情感识别、事件定位、情感分析、动作识别等六个基准测试上的实验表明，CLCR实现了强劲的性能，并在不同任务中展现出良好的泛化能力

Conclusion: CLCR通过显式建模多层次语义结构和施加层级约束，有效解决了多模态学习中的语义对齐问题，为多模态表示学习提供了新思路

Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to capture both shared and private information from multiple modalities. However, existing methods that project all modalities into a single latent space for fusion often overlook the asynchronous, multi-level semantic structure of multimodal data. This oversight induces semantic misalignment and error propagation, thereby degrading representation quality. To address this issue, we propose Cross-Level Co-Representation (CLCR), which explicitly organizes each modality's features into a three-level semantic hierarchy and specifies level-wise constraints for cross-modal interactions. First, a semantic hierarchy encoder aligns shallow, mid, and deep features across modalities, establishing a common basis for interaction. And then, at each level, an Intra-Level Co-Exchange Domain (IntraCED) factorizes features into shared and private subspaces and restricts cross-modal attention to the shared subspace via a learnable token budget. This design ensures that only shared semantics are exchanged and prevents leakage from private channels. To integrate information across levels, the Inter-Level Co-Aggregation Domain (InterCAD) synchronizes semantic scales using learned anchors, selectively fuses the shared representations, and gates private cues to form a compact task representation. We further introduce regularization terms to enforce separation of shared and private features and to minimize cross-level interference. Experiments on six benchmarks spanning emotion recognition, event localization, sentiment analysis, and action recognition show that CLCR achieves strong performance and generalizes well across tasks.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于卫星图像的自动化管道，用于检测阿富汗地区被掠夺的考古遗址，使用机器学习方法分析多光谱影像，结果表明预训练CNN结合空间掩码效果最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 考古遗址的非法盗掘对文化遗产构成严重威胁，但监测数千个偏远地点在操作上仍然非常困难，需要一种可扩展的解决方案。

Method: 使用PlanetScope月度镶嵌影像(4.7米/像素)和精心策划的阿富汗1934个考古遗址数据集(898个被掠夺，1045个保存完好)。比较两种方法：(1)端到端CNN分类器在原始RGB图像块上训练，(2)传统机器学习使用手工制作的谱特征/纹理特征以及最新遥感基础模型的嵌入。

Result: ImageNet预训练的CNN结合空间掩码达到0.926的F1分数，明显超过最强的传统机器学习设置(0.710 F1分数)。消融研究表明ImageNet预训练和空间掩码提升性能，而地理空间基础模型嵌入与手工特征表现相当，表明掠夺特征非常局部化。

Conclusion: 卫星图像和深度学习方法可以有效监测偏远地区的考古遗址掠夺问题，预训练CNN结合领域适配技术在该任务上表现优异，为文化遗产保护提供了可行的技术方案。该方法和数据集已开源，可供研究人员使用。

Abstract: Looting at archaeological sites poses a severe risk to cultural heritage, yet monitoring thousands of remote locations remains operationally difficult. We present a scalable and satellite-based pipeline to detect looted archaeological sites, using PlanetScope monthly mosaics (4.7m/pixel) and a curated dataset of 1,943 archaeological sites in Afghanistan (898 looted, 1,045 preserved) with multi-year imagery (2016--2023) and site-footprint masks. We compare (i) end-to-end CNN classifiers trained on raw RGB patches and (ii) traditional machine learning (ML) trained on handcrafted spectral/texture features and embeddings from recent remote-sensing foundation models. Results indicate that ImageNet-pretrained CNNs combined with spatial masking reach an F1 score of 0.926, clearly surpassing the strongest traditional ML setup, which attains an F1 score of 0.710 using SatCLIP-V+RF+Mean, i.e., location and vision embeddings fed into a Random Forest with mean-based temporal aggregation. Ablation studies demonstrate that ImageNet pretraining (even in the presence of domain shift) and spatial masking enhance performance. In contrast, geospatial foundation model embeddings perform competitively with handcrafted features, suggesting that looting signatures are extremely localized.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success in broad visual understanding, yet they remain challenged by object-centric reasoning on rare objects due to the scarcity of such instances in pretraining data. While prior efforts alleviate this issue by retrieving additional data or introducing stronger vision encoders, these methods are still computationally intensive during finetuning VLMs and don't fully exploit the original training data. In this paper, we introduce an efficient plug-and-play module that substantially improves VLMs' reasoning over rare objects by refining visual tokens and enriching input text prompts, without VLMs finetuning. Specifically, we propose to learn multi-modal class embeddings for rare objects by leveraging prior knowledge from vision foundation models and synonym-augmented text descriptions, compensating for limited training examples. These embeddings refine the visual tokens in VLMs through a lightweight attention-based enhancement module that improves fine-grained object details. In addition, we use the learned embeddings as object-aware detectors to generate informative hints, which are injected into the text prompts to help guide the VLM's attention toward relevant image regions. Experiments on two benchmarks show consistent and substantial gains for pretrained VLMs in rare object recognition and reasoning. Further analysis reveals how our method strengthens the VLM's ability to focus on and reason about rare objects.

Abstract: While advancements in Text-to-Video (T2V) generative AI offer a promising path toward democratizing content creation, current models are often optimized for visual fidelity rather than instructional efficacy. This study introduces PedaCo-Gen, a pedagogically-informed human-AI collaborative video generating system for authoring instructional videos based on Mayer's Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning (CTML). Moving away from traditional "one-shot" generation, PedaCo-Gen introduces an Intermediate Representation (IR) phase, enabling educators to interactively review and refine video blueprints-comprising scripts and visual descriptions-with an AI reviewer. Our study with 23 education experts demonstrates that PedaCo-Gen significantly enhances video quality across various topics and CTML principles compared to baselines. Participants perceived the AI-driven guidance not merely as a set of instructions but as a metacognitive scaffold that augmented their instructional design expertise, reporting high production efficiency (M=4.26) and guide validity (M=4.04). These findings highlight the importance of reclaiming pedagogical agency through principled co-creation, providing a foundation for future AI authoring tools that harmonize generative power with human professional expertise.

Abstract: We present SAM-H and WOFTSAM, novel planar trackers that combine robust long-term segmentation tracking provided by SAM 2 with 8 degrees-of-freedom homography pose estimation. SAM-H estimates homographies from segmentation mask contours and is thus highly robust to target appearance changes. WOFTSAM significantly improves the current state-of-the-art planar tracker WOFT by exploiting lost target re-detection provided by SAM-H. The proposed methods are evaluated on POT-210 and PlanarTrack tracking benchmarks, setting the new state-of-the-art performance on both. On the latter, they outperform the second best by a large margin, +12.4 and +15.2pp on the p@15 metric. We also present improved ground-truth annotations of initial PlanarTrack poses, enabling more accurate benchmarking in the high-precision p@5 metric.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have seen rapid and widespread adoption. However, their powerful generative capabilities raise concerns about potential misuse for synthesizing harmful, private, or copyrighted content. To mitigate such risks, concept erasure techniques have emerged as a promising solution. Prior works have primarily focused on fine-tuning the denoising component (e.g., the U-Net backbone). However, recent causal tracing studies suggest that visual attribute information is localized in the early self-attention layers of the text encoder, indicating a potential alternative for concept erasing. Building on this insight, we conduct preliminary experiments and find that directly fine-tuning early layers can suppress target concepts but often degrades the generation quality of non-target concepts. To overcome this limitation, we propose High-Level Representation Misdirection (HiRM), which misdirects high-level semantic representations of target concepts in the text encoder toward designated vectors such as random directions or semantically defined directions (e.g., supercategories), while updating only early layers that contain causal states of visual attributes. Our decoupling strategy enables precise concept removal with minimal impact on unrelated concepts, as demonstrated by strong results on UnlearnCanvas and NSFW benchmarks across diverse targets (e.g., objects, styles, nudity). HiRM also preserves generative utility at low training cost, transfers to state-of-the-art architectures such as Flux without additional training, and shows synergistic effects with denoiser-based concept erasing methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纵向医疗报告生成面临数据隐私限制和疾病进展随时间演变的双重挑战；现有联邦学习方法假设客户端数据分布静止，无法建模跨时间访问的时间动态变化和患者异质性，导致优化不稳定和报告生成效果不佳。

Method: 提出了FedTAR框架，该框架整合了基于人口的个性化特征提取（通过轻量级LoRA适配器）和时间感知的全局聚合；采用时序残差聚合策略，不同时间点访问的更新权重通过一阶MAML元学习的时间策略进行优化。

Conclusion: FedTAR作为一个鲁棒且保护隐私的联邦纵向建模范式，为医疗领域的时间动态建模提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Longitudinal medical report generation is clinically important yet remains challenging due to strict privacy constraints and the evolving nature of disease progression. Although federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training without data sharing, existing FL methods largely overlook longitudinal dynamics by assuming stationary client distributions, making them unable to model temporal shifts across visits or patient-specific heterogeneity-ultimately leading to unstable optimization and suboptimal report generation.
  We introduce Federated Temporal Adaptation (FTA), a federated setting that explicitly accounts for the temporal evolution of client data. Building upon this setting, we propose FedTAR, a framework that integrates demographic-driven personalization with time-aware global aggregation. FedTAR generates lightweight LoRA adapters from demographic embeddings and performs temporal residual aggregation, where updates from different visits are weighted by a meta-learned temporal policy optimized via first-order MAML.
  Experiments on J-MID (1M exams) and MIMIC-CXR demonstrate consistent improvements in linguistic accuracy, temporal coherence, and cross-site generalization, establishing FedTAR as a robust and privacy-preserving paradigm for federated longitudinal modeling.

Abstract: Joint reconstruction of 3D human and object from a single image is an active research area, with pivotal applications in robotics and digital content creation. Despite recent advances, existing approaches suffer from two fundamental limitations. First, their reconstructions rely heavily on physical contact information, which inherently cannot capture non-contact human-object interactions, such as gazing at or pointing toward an object. Second, the reconstruction process is primarily driven by local geometric proximity, neglecting the human and object appearances that provide global context crucial for understanding holistic interactions. To address these issues, we introduce TeHOR, a framework built upon two core designs. First, beyond contact information, our framework leverages text descriptions of human-object interactions to enforce semantic alignment between the 3D reconstruction and its textual cues, enabling reasoning over a wider spectrum of interactions, including non-contact cases. Second, we incorporate appearance cues of the 3D human and object into the alignment process to capture holistic contextual information, thereby ensuring visually plausible reconstructions. As a result, our framework produces accurate and semantically coherent reconstructions, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: BayesFusion-SDF是一个基于CPU的、概率性的符号距离函数融合框架，用于从深度观测进行密集3D重建。它将几何建模为稀疏高斯随机场，提供后验距离分布，比传统TSDF方法更准确，并能提供用于主动感知的不确定性估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统体素融合方法（如TSDF）依赖启发式加权，缺乏系统性的不确定性表达；而最近的神经隐式方法需要大量GPU算力优化，且决策透明度不足。需要一种既能提供高精度几何重建，又能透明表达不确定性、且计算高效的替代方案。

Method: 首先用粗略TSDF重建创建自适应窄带域；然后通过异方差贝叶斯公式融合深度观测，使用稀疏线性代数和预条件共轭梯度求解；最后用随机对角线估计器快速近似后验不确定性，支持表面提取和最优视点规划。

Result: 在受控消融场景和CO3D物体序列上的测试表明，该方法几何精度优于TSDF基线，并能提供有效的主动感知不确定性估计，在保持可解释性的同时提供清晰的概率框架。

Conclusion: BayesFusion-SDF为GPU密集型神经重建方法提供了一个透明易用的替代方案，具有概率可解释性和确定性行为，适用于机器人、增强现实和数字检测等需要密集3D重建的应用领域。

Abstract: Key part of robotics, augmented reality, and digital inspection is dense 3D reconstruction from depth observations. Traditional volumetric fusion techniques, including truncated signed distance functions (TSDF), enable efficient and deterministic geometry reconstruction; however, they depend on heuristic weighting and fail to transparently convey uncertainty in a systematic way. Recent neural implicit methods, on the other hand, get very high fidelity but usually need a lot of GPU power for optimization and aren't very easy to understand for making decisions later on. This work presents BayesFusion-SDF, a CPU-centric probabilistic signed distance fusion framework that conceptualizes geometry as a sparse Gaussian random field with a defined posterior distribution over voxel distances. First, a rough TSDF reconstruction is used to create an adaptive narrow-band domain. Then, depth observations are combined using a heteroscedastic Bayesian formulation that is solved using sparse linear algebra and preconditioned conjugate gradients. Randomized diagonal estimators are a quick way to get an idea of posterior uncertainty. This makes it possible to extract surfaces and plan the next best view while taking into account uncertainty. Tests on a controlled ablation scene and a CO3D object sequence show that the new method is more accurate geometrically than TSDF baselines and gives useful estimates of uncertainty for active sensing. The proposed formulation provides a clear and easy-to-use alternative to GPU-heavy neural reconstruction methods while still being able to be understood in a probabilistic way and acting in a predictable way.

Abstract: Single LDR to HDR reconstruction remains challenging for over-exposed regions where traditional methods often fail due to complete information loss. We present a training-free approach that enhances existing indirect and direct HDR reconstruction methods through diffusion-based inpainting. Our method combines text-guided diffusion models with SDEdit refinement to generate plausible content in over-exposed areas while maintaining consistency across multi-exposure LDR images. Unlike previous approaches requiring extensive training, our method seamlessly integrates with existing HDR reconstruction techniques through an iterative compensation mechanism that ensures luminance coherence across multiple exposures. We demonstrate significant improvements in both perceptual quality and quantitative metrics on standard HDR datasets and in-the-wild captures. Results show that our method effectively recovers natural details in challenging scenarios while preserving the advantages of existing HDR reconstruction pipelines.

Abstract: Beyond general recognition tasks, specialized domains including privacy-constrained medical applications and fine-grained settings often encounter data scarcity, especially for tail classes. To obtain less biased and more reliable models under such scarcity, practitioners leverage diffusion models to supplement underrepresented regions of real data. Specifically, recent studies fine-tune pretrained diffusion models with LoRA on few-shot real sets to synthesize additional images. While an image-wise LoRA trained on a single image captures fine-grained details yet offers limited diversity, a class-wise LoRA trained over all shots produces diverse images as it encodes class priors yet tends to overlook fine details. To combine both benefits, we separate the adapter into a class-shared LoRA~$A$ for class priors and per-image LoRAs~$\mathcal{B}$ for image-specific characteristics. To expose coherent class semantics in the shared LoRA~$A$, we propose a semantic boosting by preserving class bounding boxes during training. For generation, we compose $A$ with a mixture of $\mathcal{B}$ using coefficients drawn from a Dirichlet distribution. Across diverse datasets, our synthesized images are both diverse and detail-rich while closely aligning with the few-shot real distribution, yielding robust gains in downstream classification accuracy.

Motivation: 现有VLA模型因将高级感知与稀疏、具身特定的动作监督耦合，导致特征坍塌和训练效率低下；且基于VQA优化的VLA主干擅长语义识别，但忽略决定动作模式的细微3D状态变化。

Method: 提出两阶段预训练管道：1）通过位姿建立基础空间接地；2）通过轨迹监督进行运动对齐。使用离散位姿令牌作为通用表示，在相机中心空间提取通用3D空间先验，然后在机器人特定动作空间进行高效具身对齐。

Conclusion: Pose-VLA通过解耦训练范式有效解决了VLA模型的特征坍塌和训练效率问题，证明了预训练通用3D空间先验的高效性以及在机器人任务中的强泛化能力。

Abstract: Existing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models often suffer from feature collapse and low training efficiency because they entangle high-level perception with sparse, embodiment-specific action supervision. Since these models typically rely on VLM backbones optimized for Visual Question Answering (VQA), they excel at semantic identification but often overlook subtle 3D state variations that dictate distinct action patterns.
  To resolve these misalignments, we propose Pose-VLA, a decoupled paradigm that separates VLA training into a pre-training phase for extracting universal 3D spatial priors in a unified camera-centric space, and a post-training phase for efficient embodiment alignment within robot-specific action space. By introducing discrete pose tokens as a universal representation, Pose-VLA seamlessly integrates spatial grounding from diverse 3D datasets with geometry-level trajectories from robotic demonstrations. Our framework follows a two-stage pre-training pipeline, establishing fundamental spatial grounding via poses followed by motion alignment through trajectory supervision.
  Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Pose-VLA achieves state-of-the-art results on RoboTwin 2.0 with a 79.5% average success rate and competitive performance on LIBERO at 96.0%. Real-world experiments further showcase robust generalization across diverse objects using only 100 demonstrations per task, validating the efficiency of our pre-training paradigm.

Abstract: Deepfake detection models often generate natural-language explanations, yet their reasoning is frequently ungrounded in visual evidence, limiting reliability. Existing evaluations measure classification accuracy but overlook reasoning fidelity. We propose DeepfakeJudge, a framework for scalable reasoning supervision and evaluation, that integrates an out-of-distribution benchmark containing recent generative and editing forgeries, a human-annotated subset with visual reasoning labels, and a suite of evaluation models, that specialize in evaluating reasoning rationales without the need for explicit ground truth reasoning rationales. The Judge is optimized through a bootstrapped generator-evaluator process that scales human feedback into structured reasoning supervision and supports both pointwise and pairwise evaluation. On the proposed meta-evaluation benchmark, our reasoning-bootstrapped model achieves an accuracy of 96.2\%, outperforming \texttt{30x} larger baselines. The reasoning judge attains very high correlation with human ratings and 98.9\% percent pairwise agreement on the human-annotated meta-evaluation subset. These results establish reasoning fidelity as a quantifiable dimension of deepfake detection and demonstrate scalable supervision for interpretable deepfake reasoning. Our user study shows that participants preferred the reasonings generated by our framework 70\% of the time, in terms of faithfulness, groundedness, and usefulness, compared to those produced by other models and datasets.

Abstract: Existing methods for instance-level 6D pose estimation typically rely on neural networks that either directly regress the pose in $\mathrm{SE}(3)$ or estimate it indirectly via local feature matching. The former struggle with object symmetries, while the latter fail in the absence of distinctive local features. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel formulation of 6D pose estimation as a conditional flow matching problem in $\mathbb{R}^3$. We introduce Flose, a generative method that infers object poses via a denoising process conditioned on local features. While prior approaches based on conditional flow matching perform denoising solely based on geometric guidance, Flose integrates appearance-based semantic features to mitigate ambiguities caused by object symmetries. We further incorporate RANSAC-based registration to handle outliers. We validate Flose on five datasets from the established BOP benchmark. Flose outperforms prior methods with an average improvement of +4.5 Average Recall. Project Website : https://tev-fbk.github.io/Flose/

Abstract: Early detection of myometrial invasion is critical for the staging and life-saving management of endometrial carcinoma (EC), a prevalent global malignancy. Transvaginal ultrasound serves as the primary, accessible screening modality in resource-constrained primary care settings; however, its diagnostic reliability is severely hindered by low tissue contrast, high operator dependence, and a pronounced scarcity of positive pathological samples. Existing artificial intelligence solutions struggle to overcome this severe class imbalance and the subtle imaging features of invasion, particularly under the strict computational limits of primary care clinics. Here we present an automated, highly efficient two-stage deep learning framework that resolves both data and computational bottlenecks in EC screening. To mitigate pathological data scarcity, we develop a structure-guided cross-modal generation network that synthesizes diverse, high-fidelity ultrasound images from unpaired magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, strictly preserving clinically essential anatomical junctions. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight screening network utilizing gradient distillation, which transfers discriminative knowledge from a high-capacity teacher model to dynamically guide sparse attention towards task-critical regions. Evaluated on a large, multicenter cohort of 7,951 participants, our model achieves a sensitivity of 99.5\%, a specificity of 97.2\%, and an area under the curve of 0.987 at a minimal computational cost (0.289 GFLOPs), substantially outperforming the average diagnostic accuracy of expert sonographers. Our approach demonstrates that combining cross-modal synthetic augmentation with knowledge-driven efficient modeling can democratize expert-level, real-time cancer screening for resource-constrained primary care settings.

TL;DR: 提出了PMM-Synth框架，通过个性化特征调制、模态一致批量调度和选择性监督损失来提升多模态MRI图像合成的跨数据集泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有统一合成模型因仅基于单一数据集训练而缺乏跨临床数据集泛化能力的问题，这是实际部署中的主要瓶颈。

Method: 基于多数据集联合训练，采用三个核心技术: 1)个性化特征调制模块根据数据集标识动态适应特征表示，缓解分布偏移；2)模态一致批量调度器在不一致模态条件下实现稳定高效的批量训练；3)选择性监督损失确保部分缺失真实模态时的有效学习。

Result: 在四个临床多模态MRI数据集上评估，PMM-Synth在单对单和多对一合成任务中均优于现有方法，在PSNR和SSIM分数上表现更优，能更好地保留解剖结构和病理细节。

Conclusion: PMM-Synth不仅支持多种合成任务，还能有效泛化至异质数据集，有望在实际诊断场景中为模态缺失情况提供可靠支持。

Abstract: Synthesizing missing modalities in multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is vital for ensuring diagnostic completeness, particularly when full acquisitions are infeasible due to time constraints, motion artifacts, and patient tolerance. Recent unified synthesis models have enabled flexible synthesis tasks by accommodating various input-output configurations. However, their training and evaluation are typically restricted to a single dataset, limiting their generalizability across diverse clinical datasets and impeding practical deployment. To address this limitation, we propose PMM-Synth, a personalized MRI synthesis framework that not only supports various synthesis tasks but also generalizes effectively across heterogeneous datasets. PMM-Synth is jointly trained on multiple multi-modal MRI datasets that differ in modality coverage, disease types, and intensity distributions. It achieves cross-dataset generalization through three core innovations: a Personalized Feature Modulation module that dynamically adapts feature representations based on dataset identifier to mitigate the impact of distributional shifts; a Modality-Consistent Batch Scheduler that facilitates stable and efficient batch training under inconsistent modality conditions; and a selective supervision loss to ensure effective learning when ground truth modalities are partially missing. Evaluated on four clinical multi-modal MRI datasets, PMM-Synth consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both one-to-one and many-to-one synthesis tasks, achieving superior PSNR and SSIM scores. Qualitative results further demonstrate improved preservation of anatomical structures and pathological details. Additionally, downstream tumor segmentation and radiological reporting studies suggest that PMM-Synth holds potential for supporting reliable diagnosis under real-world modality-missing scenarios.

Abstract: Continual Generalized Category Discovery (C-GCD) requires identifying novel classes from unlabeled data while retaining knowledge of known classes over time. Existing methods typically update classifier weights dynamically, resulting in forgetting and inconsistent feature alignment. We propose GOAL, a unified framework that introduces a fixed Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) classifier to impose a consistent geometric structure throughout learning. GOAL conducts supervised alignment for labeled samples and confidence-guided alignment for novel samples, enabling stable integration of new classes without disrupting old ones. Experiments on four benchmarks show that GOAL outperforms the prior method Happy, reducing forgetting by 16.1% and boosting novel class discovery by 3.2%, establishing a strong solution for long-horizon continual discovery.

Abstract: In autonomous driving, robust place recognition is critical for global localization and loop closure detection. While inter-modality fusion of camera and LiDAR data in multimodal place recognition (MPR) has shown promise in overcoming the limitations of unimodal counterparts, existing MPR methods basically attend to hand-crafted fusion strategies and heavily parameterized backbones that require costly retraining. To address this, we propose VGGT-MPR, a multimodal place recognition framework that adopts the Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) as a unified geometric engine for both global retrieval and re-ranking. In the global retrieval stage, VGGT extracts geometrically-rich visual embeddings through prior depth-aware and point map supervision, and densifies sparse LiDAR point clouds with predicted depth maps to improve structural representation. This enhances the discriminative ability of fused multimodal features and produces global descriptors for fast retrieval. Beyond global retrieval, we design a training-free re-ranking mechanism that exploits VGGT's cross-view keypoint-tracking capability. By combining mask-guided keypoint extraction with confidence-aware correspondence scoring, our proposed re-ranking mechanism effectively refines retrieval results without additional parameter optimization. Extensive experiments on large-scale autonomous driving benchmarks and our self-collected data demonstrate that VGGT-MPR achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting strong robustness to severe environmental changes, viewpoint shifts, and occlusions. Our code and data will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: MaSoN通过特征空间噪声合成有效解决了现有无监督变化检测方法的泛化限制，为复杂场景下的变化检测提供了更通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised change detection (UCD) in remote sensing aims to localise semantic changes between two images of the same region without relying on labelled data during training. Most recent approaches rely either on frozen foundation models in a training-free manner or on training with synthetic changes generated in pixel space. Both strategies inherently rely on predefined assumptions about change types, typically introduced through handcrafted rules, external datasets, or auxiliary generative models. Due to these assumptions, such methods fail to generalise beyond a few change types, limiting their real-world usage, especially in rare or complex scenarios. To address this, we propose MaSoN (Make Some Noise), an end-to-end UCD framework that synthesises diverse changes directly in the latent feature space during training. It generates changes that are dynamically estimated using feature statistics of target data, enabling diverse yet data-driven variation aligned with the target domain. It also easily extends to new modalities, such as SAR. MaSoN generalises strongly across diverse change types and achieves state-of-the-art performance on five benchmarks, improving the average F1 score by 14.1 percentage points.

Abstract: Image Super-Resolution (SR) aims to recover high-resolution (HR) details from low-resolution (LR) inputs, a task where Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have recently shown superior performance compared to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) based approaches. However, standard diffusion-based SR models, such as SR3, are typically trained on fixed-size patches and struggle to scale to arbitrary-sized images due to memory constraints. Applying these models via independent patch processing leads to visible seams and inconsistent textures across boundaries. In this paper, we propose InfScene-SR, a framework enabling spatially continuous super-resolution for large, arbitrary scenes. We adapt the iterative refinement process of diffusion models with a novel guided and variance-corrected fusion mechanism, allowing for the seamless generation of large-scale high-resolution imagery without retraining. We validate our approach on remote sensing datasets, demonstrating that InfScene-SR not only reconstructs fine details with high perceptual quality but also eliminates boundary artifacts, benefiting downstream tasks such as semantic segmentation.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal learning have achieved remarkable success across diverse vision-language tasks. However, such progress heavily relies on large-scale image-text datasets, making training costly and inefficient. Prior efforts in dataset filtering and pruning attempt to mitigate this issue, but still require relatively large subsets to maintain performance and fail under very small subsets. Dataset distillation offers a promising alternative, yet existing multimodal dataset distillation methods require full-dataset training and joint optimization of image pixels and text features, making them architecture-dependent and limiting cross-architecture generalization. To overcome this, we propose a learning-free dataset distillation framework that eliminates the need for large-scale training and optimization while enhancing generalization across architectures. Our method uses CLIP to extract aligned image-text embeddings, obtains prototypes, and employs an unCLIP decoder to synthesize images, enabling efficient and scalable multimodal dataset distillation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms optimization-based dataset distillation and subset selection methods, achieving state-of-the-art cross-architecture generalization.

Abstract: Recent text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models produce visually stunning images and demonstrate excellent prompt following. But do they perform well as synthetic vision data generators? In this work, we revisit the promise of synthetic data as a scalable substitute for real training sets and uncover a surprising performance regression. We generate large-scale synthetic datasets using state-of-the-art T2I models released between 2022 and 2025, train standard classifiers solely on this synthetic data, and evaluate them on real test data. Despite observable advances in visual fidelity and prompt adherence, classification accuracy on real test data consistently declines with newer T2I models as training data generators. Our analysis reveals a hidden trend: These models collapse to a narrow, aesthetic-centric distribution that undermines diversity and label-image alignment. Overall, our findings challenge a growing assumption in vision research, namely that progress in generative realism implies progress in data realism. We thus highlight an urgent need to rethink the capabilities of modern T2I models as reliable training data generators.

Abstract: Generating explorable 3D scenes from a single image is a highly challenging problem in 3D vision. Existing methods struggle to support free exploration, often producing severe geometric distortions and noisy artifacts when the viewpoint moves far from the original perspective. We introduce \textbf{One2Scene}, an effective framework that decomposes this ill-posed problem into three tractable sub-tasks to enable immersive explorable scene generation. We first use a panorama generator to produce anchor views from a single input image as initialization. Then, we lift these 2D anchors into an explicit 3D geometric scaffold via a generalizable, feed-forward Gaussian Splatting network. Instead of treating the panorama as a single image for reconstruction, we project it into multiple sparse anchor views and reformulate the reconstruction task as multi-view stereo matching, which allows us to leverage robust geometric priors learned from large-scale multi-view datasets. A bidirectional feature fusion module is used to enforce cross-view consistency, yielding an efficient and geometrically reliable scaffold. Finally, the scaffold serves as a strong prior for a novel view generator to produce photorealistic and geometrically accurate views at arbitrary cameras. By explicitly conditioning on a 3D-consistent scaffold to perform reconstruction, One2Scene works stably under large camera motions, supporting immersive scene exploration. Extensive experiments show that One2Scene substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in panorama depth estimation, feed-forward 360° reconstruction, and explorable 3D scene generation. Code and models will be released.

Abstract: Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in image understanding and natural language generation. However, current approaches focus predominantly on global image understanding, struggling to simulate human visual attention trajectories and explain associations between descriptions and specific regions. We propose TraceVision, a unified vision-language model integrating trajectory-aware spatial understanding in an end-to-end framework. TraceVision employs a Trajectory-aware Visual Perception (TVP) module for bidirectional fusion of visual features and trajectory information. We design geometric simplification to extract semantic keypoints from raw trajectories and propose a three-stage training pipeline where trajectories guide description generation and region localization. We extend TraceVision to trajectory-guided segmentation and video scene understanding, enabling cross-frame tracking and temporal attention analysis. We construct the Reasoning-based Interactive Localized Narratives (RILN) dataset to enhance logical reasoning and interpretability. Extensive experiments on trajectory-guided captioning, text-guided trajectory prediction, understanding, and segmentation demonstrate that TraceVision achieves state-of-the-art performance, establishing a foundation for intuitive spatial interaction and interpretable visual understanding.

Abstract: Accurate taxonomic identification is the cornerstone of biodiversity monitoring and agricultural management, particularly for the hyper-diverse superfamily Ichneumonoidea. Comprising the families Ichneumonidae and Braconidae, these parasitoid wasps are ecologically critical for regulating insect populations, yet they remain one of the most taxonomically challenging groups due to their cryptic morphology and vast number of undescribed species. To address the scarcity of robust digital resources for these key groups, we present a curated image dataset designed to advance automated identification systems. The dataset contains 3,556 high-resolution images, primarily focused on Neotropical Ichneumonidae and Braconidae, while also including supplementary families such as Andrenidae, Apidae, Bethylidae, Chrysididae, Colletidae, Halictidae, Megachilidae, Pompilidae, and Vespidae to improve model robustness. Crucially, a subset of 1,739 images is annotated in COCO format, featuring multi-class bounding boxes for the full insect body, wing venation, and scale bars. This resource provides a foundation for developing computer vision models capable of identifying these families.

Abstract: Autonomous vision applications in production, intralogistics, or manufacturing environments require perception capabilities beyond a small, fixed set of classes. Recent open-vocabulary methods, leveraging 2D Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLFMs), target this task but often rely on class-agnostic segmentation models pre-trained on non-industrial datasets (e.g., household scenes). In this work, we first demonstrate that such models fail to generalize, performing poorly on common industrial objects. Therefore, we propose a training-free, open-vocabulary 3D perception pipeline that overcomes this limitation. Instead of using a pre-trained model to generate instance proposals, our method simply generates masks by merging pre-computed superpoints based on their semantic features. Following, we evaluate the domain-adapted VLFM "IndustrialCLIP" on a representative 3D industrial workshop scene for open-vocabulary querying. Our qualitative results demonstrate successful segmentation of industrial objects.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: 3D human pose estimation (HPE) is characterized by intricate local and global dependencies among joints. Conventional supervised losses are limited in capturing these correlations because they treat each joint independently. Previous studies have attempted to promote structural consistency through manually designed priors or rule-based constraints; however, these approaches typically require manual specification and are often non-differentiable, limiting their use as end-to-end training objectives. We propose SEAL-pose, a data-driven framework in which a learnable loss-net trains a pose-net by evaluating structural plausibility. Rather than relying on hand-crafted priors, our joint-graph-based design enables the loss-net to learn complex structural dependencies directly from data. Extensive experiments on three 3D HPE benchmarks with eight backbones show that SEAL-pose reduces per-joint errors and improves pose plausibility compared with the corresponding backbones across all settings. Beyond improving each backbone, SEAL-pose also outperforms models with explicit structural constraints, despite not enforcing any such constraints. Finally, we analyze the relationship between the loss-net and structural consistency, and evaluate SEAL-pose in cross-dataset and in-the-wild settings.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The growing prevalence of tampered images poses serious security threats, highlighting the urgent need for reliable detection methods. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong potential in analyzing tampered images and generating interpretations. However, they still struggle with identifying micro-level artifacts, exhibit low accuracy in localizing tampered text regions, and heavily rely on expensive annotations for forgery interpretation. To this end, we introduce TextShield-R1, the first reinforcement learning based MLLM solution for tampered text detection and reasoning. Specifically, our approach introduces Forensic Continual Pre-training, an easy-to-hard curriculum that well prepares the MLLM for tampered text detection by harnessing the large-scale cheap data from natural image forensic and OCR tasks. During fine-tuning, we perform Group Relative Policy Optimization with novel reward functions to reduce annotation dependency and improve reasoning capabilities. At inference time, we enhance localization accuracy via OCR Rectification, a method that leverages the MLLM's strong text recognition abilities to refine its predictions. Furthermore, to support rigorous evaluation, we introduce the Text Forensics Reasoning (TFR) benchmark, comprising over 45k real and tampered images across 16 languages, 10 tampering techniques, and diverse domains. Rich reasoning-style annotations are included, allowing for comprehensive assessment. Our TFR benchmark simultaneously addresses seven major limitations of existing benchmarks and enables robust evaluation under cross-style, cross-method, and cross-language conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TextShield-R1 significantly advances the state of the art in interpretable tampered text detection.

Abstract: Accurate heat-demand maps play a crucial role in decarbonizing space heating, yet most municipalities lack detailed building-level data needed to calculate them. We introduce HeatPrompt, a zero-shot vision-language energy modeling framework that estimates annual heat demand using semantic features extracted from satellite images, basic Geographic Information System (GIS), and building-level features. We feed pretrained Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) with a domain-specific prompt to act as an energy planner and extract the visual attributes such as roof age, building density, etc, from the RGB satellite image that correspond to the thermal load. A Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) regressor trained on these captions shows an $R^2$ uplift of 93.7% and shrinks the mean absolute error (MAE) by 30% compared to the baseline model. Qualitative analysis shows that high-impact tokens align with high-demand zones, offering lightweight support for heat planning in data-scarce regions.

We address this challenge using class-conditioned diffusion models to generate synthetic dermatological images, followed by self-supervised MAE pretraining to enable huge ViT models to learn robust, domain-relevant features. To support deployment in practical clinical settings, where lightweight models are required, we apply knowledge distillation to transfer these representations to a smaller ViT student suitable for mobile devices. Our results show that MAE pretraining on synthetic data, combined with distillation, improves classification performance while enabling efficient on-device inference for practical clinical use.

*Filip Wolf,Blaž Rolih,Luka Čehovin Zajc*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种双教师对比蒸馏框架，用于多光谱图像的基础模型预训练，通过结合多光谱教师和光学VFM教师实现跨模态表示学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地球观测领域需要处理多样化的传感器和模态，单个通用模型不现实，需要多个专业化的基础模型并存，因此跨模态高效知识迁移变得至关重要。现有EO预训练多依赖掩码图像建模，其强调局部重建但对全局语义结构控制有限。

Method: 提出双教师对比蒸馏框架，将学生的预训练目标与光学视觉基础模型（VFMs）的对比自蒸馏范式对齐。包括一个多光谱教师和一个光学VFM教师，通过对比蒸馏实现跨模态表示学习。

Result: 在多种光学和多光谱基准测试中，模型既能适应多光谱数据，又不损害在纯光学输入上的性能，在语义分割、变化检测和分类任务上平均提升分别为3.64%、1.2%和1.31%，达到最先进水平。

Conclusion: 对比蒸馏提供了一种原则性且高效的方法，可实现在异构EO数据源上的可扩展表示学习，证明了该方法在多模态地球观测中的有效性。

Abstract: Foundation models are transforming Earth Observation (EO), yet the diversity of EO sensors and modalities makes a single universal model unrealistic. Multiple specialized EO foundation models (EOFMs) will likely coexist, making efficient knowledge transfer across modalities essential. Most existing EO pretraining relies on masked image modeling, which emphasizes local reconstruction but provides limited control over global semantic structure. To address this, we propose a dual-teacher contrastive distillation framework for multispectral imagery that aligns the student's pretraining objective with the contrastive self-distillation paradigm of modern optical vision foundation models (VFMs). Our approach combines a multispectral teacher with an optical VFM teacher, enabling coherent cross-modal representation learning. Experiments across diverse optical and multispectral benchmarks show that our model adapts to multispectral data without compromising performance on optical-only inputs, achieving state-of-the-art results in both settings, with an average improvement of 3.64 percentage points in semantic segmentation, 1.2 in change detection, and 1.31 in classification tasks. This demonstrates that contrastive distillation provides a principled and efficient approach to scalable representation learning across heterogeneous EO data sources. Code: Coming soon.

### [171] [ApET: Approximation-Error Guided Token Compression for Efficient VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19870)
*Qiankun Ma,Ziyao Zhang,Haofei Wang,Jie Chen,Zhen Song,Hairong Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 为了解决现有视觉语言模型中冗余视觉标记导致的效率问题，该论文提出了一种基于信息论的无注意力依赖的视觉标记压缩框架，通过线性近似和误差评估来保留关键信息，并实现与高效注意力机制的兼容。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在理解多模态内容方面表现出色，但由于视觉标记的冗余性，导致计算开销过大，推理效率低下。以往的研究通常依赖注意力机制进行标记筛选，但这种方法存在位置偏差的问题，且与FlashAttention等高效注意力内核不兼容，限制了在实际部署中的加速效果。因此，急需一种无需注意力参与的方法，在压缩视觉标记的同时最大化保留视觉信息，以提升模型的实际部署效率。

Method: 论文提出了一个名为ApET（Approximation-Error guided Token compression framework）的视觉标记压缩框架。该框架首先通过线性近似方法，使用一组较小的基础标记（basis tokens）重构原始视觉标记；然后，利用近似误差来识别并丢弃信息量最少的标记。整个过程完全不依赖注意力机制，从而避免了位置偏差，并能兼容FlashAttention等高效注意力内核。

Result: 在多个视觉语言模型和基准测试上进行广泛实验表明，ApET在图像理解任务中保留了95.2%的原始性能，在视频理解任务中甚至达到了100.4%的原始性能，同时成功压缩了88.9%和87.5%的标记数量。由于该框架的无注意力设计，ApET能够无缝集成FlashAttention，进一步加速推理过程，使视觉语言模型的部署更加实用。

Conclusion: 论文通过信息论视角重新审视视觉标记压缩，提出的ApET框架在无需注意力参与的情况下，有效压缩冗余视觉标记，显著提高了视觉语言模型的推理效率，并为实际部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable multimodal understanding capabilities, yet the redundant visual tokens incur prohibitive computational overhead and degrade inference efficiency. Prior studies typically relies on [CLS] attention or text-vision cross-attention to identify and discard redundant visual tokens. Despite promising results, such solutions are prone to introduce positional bias and, more critically, are incompatible with efficient attention kernels such as FlashAttention, limiting their practical deployment for VLM acceleration. In this paper, we step away from attention dependencies and revisit visual token compression from an information-theoretic perspective, aiming to maximally preserve visual information without any attention involvement. We present ApET, an Approximation-Error guided Token compression framework. ApET first reconstructs the original visual tokens with a small set of basis tokens via linear approximation, then leverages the approximation error to identify and drop the least informative tokens. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that ApET retains 95.2% of the original performance on image-understanding tasks and even attains 100.4% on video-understanding tasks, while compressing the token budgets by 88.9% and 87.5%, respectively. Thanks to its attention-free design, ApET seamlessly integrates with FlashAttention, enabling further inference acceleration and making VLM deployment more practical.

TL;DR: 这篇论文首次针对视觉Transformer（VTs）提出了机器遗忘（MU）的基准测试，填补了现有MU研究主要集中在CNN而缺乏VT评估的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习中的遗忘能力对于构建安全、公平的AI至关重要，而视觉Transformer正逐渐成为计算机视觉任务的重要架构，但现有的MU研究主要集中在CNN，缺乏针对VTs的系统性评估基准。

Method: 研究采用多种VTs架构（ViT和Swin-T）、不同容量模型，结合不同规模和复杂度的数据集，以及代表不同方法论的MU算法进行评估，同时包含单次和持续遗忘协议，重点关注利用训练数据记忆化的算法性能，并分析了VT与CNN在记忆化特性上的差异。

Result: 该工作首次建立了可重现、公平且全面的VTs遗忘算法比较基准，为现有和未来MU算法在VT环境中的表现提供了参考基准和性能基线。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次为视觉Transformer的机器遗忘研究提供了系统性的基准测试框架，揭示了现有算法在VT环境中的实际效果，为未来研究奠定了重要基础。

Abstract: Research in machine unlearning (MU) has gained strong momentum: MU is now widely regarded as a critical capability for building safe and fair AI. In parallel, research into transformer architectures for computer vision tasks has been highly successful: Increasingly, Vision Transformers (VTs) emerge as strong alternatives to CNNs. Yet, MU research for vision tasks has largely centered on CNNs, not VTs. While benchmarking MU efforts have addressed LLMs, diffusion models, and CNNs, none exist for VTs. This work is the first to attempt this, benchmarking MU algorithm performance in different VT families (ViT and Swin-T) and at different capacities. The work employs (i) different datasets, selected to assess the impacts of dataset scale and complexity; (ii) different MU algorithms, selected to represent fundamentally different approaches for MU; and (iii) both single-shot and continual unlearning protocols. Additionally, it focuses on benchmarking MU algorithms that leverage training data memorization, since leveraging memorization has been recently discovered to significantly improve the performance of previously SOTA algorithms. En route, the work characterizes how VTs memorize training data relative to CNNs, and assesses the impact of different memorization proxies on performance. The benchmark uses unified evaluation metrics that capture two complementary notions of forget quality along with accuracy on unseen (test) data and on retained data. Overall, this work offers a benchmarking basis, enabling reproducible, fair, and comprehensive comparisons of existing (and future) MU algorithms on VTs. And, for the first time, it sheds light on how well existing algorithms work in VT settings, establishing a promising reference performance baseline.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了BigMaQ数据集，包含750多个场景的恒河猴互动视频，提供详细的3D姿态描述和纹理化虚拟角色，建立了动物行为识别与3D姿态重建的联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前动物行为识别主要依赖视频和稀疏关键点，无法捕捉完整的动作动态，特别是非人灵长类动物的网格追踪研究滞后，需要整合3D姿态和形状信息来提升行为识别精度。

Method: 构建BigMaQ数据集，为每只恒河猴创建个性化的纹理化虚拟角色，并基于此提供比现有方法更准确的3D姿态描述。同时推出BigMaQ500行为识别基准测试，将表面姿态特征与图像/视频特征结合进行分析。

Result: 实验表明，加入姿态信息后，平均精度均值（mAP）有显著提升。该数据集首次将动态3D姿态-形状表示融入动物行为识别学习任务。

Conclusion: BigMaQ集成为首个整合3D姿态-形状表示的灵长类动物行为识别数据集，为研究视觉外观、姿态和社会互动提供了丰富资源。

Abstract: The recognition of dynamic and social behavior in animals is fundamental for advancing ethology, ecology, medicine and neuroscience. Recent progress in deep learning has enabled automated behavior recognition from video, yet an accurate reconstruction of the three-dimensional (3D) pose and shape has not been integrated into this process. Especially for non-human primates, mesh-based tracking efforts lag behind those for other species, leaving pose descriptions restricted to sparse keypoints that are unable to fully capture the richness of action dynamics. To address this gap, we introduce the $\textbf{Big Ma}$ca$\textbf{Q}$ue 3D Motion and Animation Dataset ($\texttt{BigMaQ}$), a large-scale dataset comprising more than 750 scenes of interacting rhesus macaques with detailed 3D pose descriptions. Extending previous surface-based animal tracking methods, we construct subject-specific textured avatars by adapting a high-quality macaque template mesh to individual monkeys. This allows us to provide pose descriptions that are more accurate than previous state-of-the-art surface-based animal tracking methods. From the original dataset, we derive BigMaQ500, an action recognition benchmark that links surface-based pose vectors to single frames across multiple individual monkeys. By pairing features extracted from established image and video encoders with and without our pose descriptors, we demonstrate substantial improvements in mean average precision (mAP) when pose information is included. With these contributions, $\texttt{BigMaQ}$ establishes the first dataset that both integrates dynamic 3D pose-shape representations into the learning task of animal action recognition and provides a rich resource to advance the study of visual appearance, posture, and social interaction in non-human primates. The code and data are publicly available at https://martinivis.github.io/BigMaQ/ .

Abstract: Rapid progress in video models has largely focused on visual quality, leaving their reasoning capabilities underexplored. Video reasoning grounds intelligence in spatiotemporally consistent visual environments that go beyond what text can naturally capture, enabling intuitive reasoning over spatiotemporal structure such as continuity, interaction, and causality. However, systematically studying video reasoning and its scaling behavior is hindered by the lack of large-scale training data. To address this gap, we introduce the Very Big Video Reasoning (VBVR) Dataset, an unprecedentedly large-scale resource spanning 200 curated reasoning tasks following a principled taxonomy and over one million video clips, approximately three orders of magnitude larger than existing datasets. We further present VBVR-Bench, a verifiable evaluation framework that moves beyond model-based judging by incorporating rule-based, human-aligned scorers, enabling reproducible and interpretable diagnosis of video reasoning capabilities. Leveraging the VBVR suite, we conduct one of the first large-scale scaling studies of video reasoning and observe early signs of emergent generalization to unseen reasoning tasks. Together, VBVR lays a foundation for the next stage of research in generalizable video reasoning. The data, benchmark toolkit, and models are publicly available at https://video-reason.com/ .

Abstract: The lactation performance of Saanen dairy goats, renowned for their high milk yield, is intrinsically linked to their body size, making accurate 3D body measurement essential for assessing milk production potential, yet existing reconstruction methods lack goat-specific authentic 3D data. To address this limitation, we establish the FemaleSaanenGoat dataset containing synchronized eight-view RGBD videos of 55 female Saanen goats (6-18 months). Using multi-view DynamicFusion, we fuse noisy, non-rigid point cloud sequences into high-fidelity 3D scans, overcoming challenges from irregular surfaces and rapid movement. Based on these scans, we develop SaanenGoat, a parametric 3D shape model specifically designed for female Saanen goats. This model features a refined template with 41 skeletal joints and enhanced udder representation, registered with our scan data. A comprehensive shape space constructed from 48 goats enables precise representation of diverse individual variations. With the help of SaanenGoat model, we get high-precision 3D reconstruction from single-view RGBD input, and achieve automated measurement of six critical body dimensions: body length, height, chest width, chest girth, hip width, and hip height. Experimental results demonstrate the superior accuracy of our method in both 3D reconstruction and body measurement, presenting a novel paradigm for large-scale 3D vision applications in precision livestock farming.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高保真个性化头部表征方法，通过解耦身份和表情，结合扩散变换器生成高度表达力、连贯可控的电影级肖像视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有肖像生成方法使用2D关键点或参数化模型等中间信号，因其稀疏或低秩表示导致解耦能力有限，无法表达个性化细节，难以保持身份一致性和表情准确性，限制了高表达力肖像视频的生成。

Method: 1) 提出高保真个性化头部表征，同时捕获静态主体特定全局几何和动态表情相关细节；2) 设计表情迁移模块，实现不同身份之间头部姿态和表情细节的个性化迁移；3) 将该头部模型作为条件信号训练基于扩散变换器的生成器，合成细节丰富的肖像视频。

Result: 在自重演和交叉重演任务上的大量实验表明，本方法在身份保持、表情准确性和时间稳定性方面优于先前模型，尤其在捕捉复杂运动的细粒度细节上表现突出。

Conclusion: 该方法通过创新的高保真个性化头部表征和改进的生成框架，成功解决了电影级肖像视频生成中保持身份一致性、表情准确性和时间稳定性的关键挑战，为高质量肖像视频生成提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: While diffusion models have shown great potential in portrait generation, generating expressive, coherent, and controllable cinematic portrait videos remains a significant challenge. Existing intermediate signals for portrait generation, such as 2D landmarks and parametric models, have limited disentanglement capabilities and cannot express personalized details due to their sparse or low-rank representation. Therefore, existing methods based on these models struggle to accurately preserve subject identity and expressions, hindering the generation of highly expressive portrait videos. To overcome these limitations, we propose a high-fidelity personalized head representation that more effectively disentangles expression and identity. This representation captures both static, subject-specific global geometry and dynamic, expression-related details. Furthermore, we introduce an expression transfer module to achieve personalized transfer of head pose and expression details between different identities. We use this sophisticated and highly expressive head model as a conditional signal to train a diffusion transformer (DiT)-based generator to synthesize richly detailed portrait videos. Extensive experiments on self- and cross-reenactment tasks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous models in terms of identity preservation, expression accuracy, and temporal stability, particularly in capturing fine-grained details of complex motion.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对医学图像的对比学习新选择策略，通过使用疾病严重程度标签而非随机增广来构建正负样本对，从而提高生物标志物分类准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自然图像中，对比学习通常使用随机增广来构建正负样本对。但在医学图像领域，随机增广可能会扭曲包含关键生物标志物的小型局部区域。更直观的方法是选择具有相似疾病严重程度特征的样本，因为这些样本更可能具有相似的疾病相关结构。

Method: 1) 引入一种方法为未标记的OCT扫描生成疾病严重程度标签，基于异常检测算法的梯度响应。2) 使用这些标签训练监督对比学习框架，选取具有相似疾病严重程度特征的样本作为正样本对。

Result: 该方法将关键糖尿病视网膜病变指标的生物标志物分类准确率提高了6%，超越了自监督基线方法。

Conclusion: 针对医学图像的对比学习应当考虑疾病严重程度特征，而非依赖随机增广，这种方法能更有效地捕捉与疾病相关的结构信息，从而提升分类性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel selection strategy for contrastive learning for medical images. On natural images, contrastive learning uses augmentations to select positive and negative pairs for the contrastive loss. However, in the medical domain, arbitrary augmentations have the potential to distort small localized regions that contain the biomarkers we are interested in detecting. A more intuitive approach is to select samples with similar disease severity characteristics, since these samples are more likely to have similar structures related to the progression of a disease. To enable this, we introduce a method that generates disease severity labels for unlabeled OCT scans on the basis of gradient responses from an anomaly detection algorithm. These labels are used to train a supervised contrastive learning setup to improve biomarker classification accuracy by as much as 6% above self-supervised baselines for key indicators of Diabetic Retinopathy.

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify both known and unknown categories, with only partial labels given for the known categories, posing a challenging open-set recognition problem. State-of-the-art approaches for GCD task are usually built on multi-modality representation learning, which is heavily dependent upon inter-modality alignment. However, few of them cast a proper intra-modality alignment to generate a desired underlying structure of representation distributions. In this paper, we propose a novel and effective multi-modal representation learning framework for GCD via Semi-Supervised Rate Reduction, called SSR$^2$-GCD, to learn cross-modality representations with desired structural properties based on emphasizing to properly align intra-modality relationships. Moreover, to boost knowledge transfer, we integrate prompt candidates by leveraging the inter-modal alignment offered by Vision Language Models. We conduct extensive experiments on generic and fine-grained benchmark datasets demonstrating superior performance of our approach.

Conclusion: 通过增强高斯核和误差驱动补偿，该方法成功解决了3DGS中反射建模的局限性，实现了高质量且参数效率高的增强辐射场重建

Abstract: Due to the real-time rendering performance, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as the leading method for radiance field reconstruction. However, its reliance on spherical harmonics for color encoding inherently limits its ability to separate diffuse and specular components, making it challenging to accurately represent complex reflections. To address this, we propose a novel enhanced Gaussian kernel that explicitly models specular effects through view-dependent opacity. Meanwhile, we introduce an error-driven compensation strategy to improve rendering quality in existing 3DGS scenes. Our method begins with 2D Gaussian initialization and then adaptively inserts and optimizes enhanced Gaussian kernels, ultimately producing an augmented radiance field. Experiments demonstrate that our method not only surpasses state-of-the-art NeRF methods in rendering performance but also achieves greater parameter efficiency.

Abstract: Learning neural implicit fields of 3D shapes is a rapidly emerging field that enables shape representation at arbitrary resolutions. Due to the flexibility, neural implicit fields have succeeded in many research areas, including shape reconstruction, novel view image synthesis, and more recently, object pose estimation. Neural implicit fields enable learning dense correspondences between the camera space and the object's canonical space-including unobserved regions in camera space-significantly boosting object pose estimation performance in challenging scenarios like highly occluded objects and novel shapes. Despite progress, predicting canonical coordinates for unobserved camera-space regions remains challenging due to the lack of direct observational signals. This necessitates heavy reliance on the model's generalization ability, resulting in high uncertainty. Consequently, densely sampling points across the entire camera space may yield inaccurate estimations that hinder the learning process and compromise performance. To alleviate this problem, we propose a method combining an SO(3)-equivariant convolutional implicit network and a positive-incentive point sampling (PIPS) strategy. The SO(3)-equivariant convolutional implicit network estimates point-level attributes with SO(3)-equivariance at arbitrary query locations, demonstrating superior performance compared to most existing baselines. The PIPS strategy dynamically determines sampling locations based on the input, thereby boosting the network's accuracy and training efficiency. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art on three pose estimation datasets. Notably, it demonstrates significant improvements in challenging scenarios, such as objects captured with unseen pose, high occlusion, novel geometry, and severe noise.

Abstract: Recent advancements in image generation have achieved impressive results in producing high-quality images. However, existing image generation models still generally struggle with a spatial reasoning dilemma, lacking the ability to accurately capture fine-grained spatial relationships from the prompt and correctly generate scenes with structural integrity. To mitigate this dilemma, we propose RL-RIG, a Reinforcement Learning framework for Reflection-based Image Generation. Our architecture comprises four primary components: Diffuser, Checker, Actor, and Inverse Diffuser, following a Generate-Reflect-Edit paradigm to spark the Chain of Thought reasoning ability in image generation for addressing the dilemma. To equip the model with better intuition over generation trajectories, we further develop Reflection-GRPO to train the VLM Actor for edit prompts and the Image Editor for better image quality under a given prompt, respectively. Unlike traditional approaches that solely produce visually stunning yet structurally unreasonable content, our evaluation metrics prioritize spatial accuracy, utilizing Scene Graph IoU and employing a VLM-as-a-Judge strategy to assess the spatial consistency of generated images on LAION-SG dataset. Experimental results show that RL-RIG outperforms existing state-of-the-art open-source models by up to 11% in terms of controllable and precise spatial reasoning in image generation.

Abstract: Automotive perception systems are obligated to meet high requirements. While optical sensors such as Camera and Lidar struggle in adverse weather conditions, Radar provides a more robust perception performance, effectively penetrating fog, rain, and snow. Since full Radar tensors have large data sizes and very few datasets provide them, most Radar-based approaches work with sparse point clouds or 2D projections, which can result in information loss. Additionally, deep learning methods show potential to extract richer and more dense features from low level Radar data and therefore significantly increase the perception performance. Therefore, we propose a 3D projection method for fast-Fourier-transformed 4D Range-Azimuth-Doppler-Elevation (RADE) tensors. Our method preserves rich Doppler and Elevation features while reducing the required data size for a single frame by 91.9% compared to a full tensor, thus achieving higher training and inference speed as well as lower model complexity. We introduce RADE-Net, a lightweight model tailored to 3D projections of the RADE tensor. The backbone enables exploitation of low-level and high-level cues of Radar tensors with spatial and channel-attention. The decoupled detection heads predict object center-points directly in the Range-Azimuth domain and regress rotated 3D bounding boxes from rich feature maps in the cartesian scene. We evaluate the model on scenes with multiple different road users and under various weather conditions on the large-scale K-Radar dataset and achieve a 16.7% improvement compared to their baseline, as well as 6.5% improvement over current Radar-only models. Additionally, we outperform several Lidar approaches in scenarios with adverse weather conditions. The code is available under https://github.com/chr-is-tof/RADE-Net.

TL;DR: Token-UNet是一种用于3D医学影像分割的高效模型，采用TokenLearner和TokenFuser模块将Transformer嵌入UNet架构，显著减少计算资源需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于Transformer的3D医学影像分割模型在普通硬件上部署的计算挑战，特别是注意力机制随输入分辨率呈二次方和三次方扩展的问题。

Method: 保留UNet的卷积编码器，使用TokenLearner模块从3D特征图中池化预设数量的token来表示局部和全局结构，然后通过Transformer处理这些token，再用TokenFuser重建特征图。

Result: 最重模型的显存占用、推理时间和参数数量分别减少到SwinUNETR的33%、10%和35%，且在分割任务上获得更好的平均性能（Dice分数87.21% vs 86.75%）。

Conclusion: Token-UNet为有限计算资源环境下的3D医学影像分析提供了高效解决方案，有助于加速和多样化医学影像研究的发展。

Abstract: We present Token-UNet, adopting the TokenLearner and TokenFuser modules to encase Transformers into UNets.
  While Transformers have enabled global interactions among input elements in medical imaging, current computational challenges hinder their deployment on common hardware. Models like (Swin)UNETR adapt the UNet architecture by incorporating (Swin)Transformer encoders, which process tokens that each represent small subvolumes ($8^3$ voxels) of the input.
  The Transformer attention mechanism scales quadratically with the number of tokens, which is tied to the cubic scaling of 3D input resolution.
  This work reconsiders the role of convolution and attention, introducing Token-UNets, a family of 3D segmentation models that can operate in constrained computational environments and time frames.
  To mitigate computational demands, our approach maintains the convolutional encoder of UNet-like models, and applies TokenLearner to 3D feature maps. This module pools a preset number of tokens from local and global structures.
  Our results show this tokenization effectively encodes task-relevant information, yielding naturally interpretable attention maps. The memory footprint, computation times at inference, and parameter counts of our heaviest model are reduced to 33\%, 10\%, and 35\% of the SwinUNETR values, with better average performance (86.75\% $\pm 0.19\%$ Dice score for SwinUNETR vs our 87.21\% $\pm 0.35\%$).
  This work opens the way to more efficient trainings in contexts with limited computational resources, such as 3D medical imaging. Easing model optimization, fine-tuning, and transfer-learning in limited hardware settings can accelerate and diversify the development of approaches, for the benefit of the research community.

Abstract: In multimodal learning, CLIP has emerged as the de-facto approach for mapping different modalities into a shared latent space by bringing semantically similar representations closer while pushing apart dissimilar ones. However, CLIP-based contrastive losses exhibit unintended behaviors that negatively impact true semantic alignment, leading to sparse and fragmented latent spaces. This phenomenon, known as the modality gap, has been partially mitigated for standard text and image pairs but remains unknown and unresolved in more complex multimodal settings, such as the medical domain. In this work, we study this phenomenon in the latter case, revealing that the modality gap is present also in medical alignment, and we propose a modality-agnostic framework that closes this gap, ensuring that semantically related representations are more aligned, regardless of their source modality. Our method enhances alignment between radiology images and clinical text, improving cross-modal retrieval and image captioning.

Abstract: Deep learning-based image watermarking, while robust against conventional distortions, remains vulnerable to advanced adversarial and regeneration attacks. Conventional countermeasures, which jointly optimize the encoder and decoder via a noise layer, face 2 inevitable challenges: (1) decrease of clean accuracy due to decoder adversarial training and (2) limited robustness due to simultaneous training of all three advanced attacks. To overcome these issues, we propose AdvMark, a novel two-stage fine-tuning framework that decouples the defense strategies. In stage 1, we address adversarial vulnerability via a tailored adversarial training paradigm that primarily fine-tunes the encoder while only conditionally updating the decoder. This approach learns to move the image into a non-attackable region, rather than modifying the decision boundary, thus preserving clean accuracy. In stage 2, we tackle distortion and regeneration attacks via direct image optimization. To preserve the adversarial robustness gained in stage 1, we formulate a principled, constrained image loss with theoretical guarantees, which balances the deviation from cover and previous encoded images. We also propose a quality-aware early-stop to further guarantee the lower bound of visual quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate AdvMark outperforms with the highest image quality and comprehensive robustness, i.e. up to 29\%, 33\% and 46\% accuracy improvement for distortion, regeneration and adversarial attacks, respectively.

Motivation: 现有基于锚点的生成模型依赖离散锚点词汇表来覆盖轨迹分布，这导致词汇表大小与模型性能之间的固有权衡，限制了模型的鲁棒性和效率

Method: 1) 引入高斯混合噪声(GMN)指导生成采样，实现轨迹空间的连续表示；2) 采用'MeanFlow Identity'方法建模GMN与轨迹分布之间的平均速度场而非瞬时速度场；3) 设计轻量级自适应重建模块(ARM)，通过注意力权重隐式选择或重建轨迹

Conclusion: MeanFuser为端到端自动驾驶提供了一个鲁棒且高效的解决方案，通过连续表示和优化采样机制克服了现有基于锚点方法的局限性

Abstract: Generative models have shown great potential in trajectory planning. Recent studies demonstrate that anchor-guided generative models are effective in modeling the uncertainty of driving behaviors and improving overall performance. However, these methods rely on discrete anchor vocabularies that must sufficiently cover the trajectory distribution during testing to ensure robustness, inducing an inherent trade-off between vocabulary size and model performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose MeanFuser, an end-to-end autonomous driving method that enhances both efficiency and robustness through three key designs. (1) We introduce Gaussian Mixture Noise (GMN) to guide generative sampling, enabling a continuous representation of the trajectory space and eliminating the dependency on discrete anchor vocabularies. (2) We adapt ``MeanFlow Identity" to end-to-end planning, which models the mean velocity field between GMN and trajectory distribution instead of the instantaneous velocity field used in vanilla flow matching methods, effectively eliminating numerical errors from ODE solvers and significantly accelerating inference. (3) We design a lightweight Adaptive Reconstruction Module (ARM) that enables the model to implicitly select from all sampled proposals or reconstruct a new trajectory when none is satisfactory via attention weights. Experiments on the NAVSIM closed-loop benchmark demonstrate that MeanFuser achieves outstanding performance without the supervision of the PDM Score. and exceptional inference efficiency, offering a robust and efficient solution for end-to-end autonomous driving. Our code and model are available at https://github.com/wjl2244/MeanFuser.

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks achieve high performance in vision tasks by learning features from regions of interest (ROI) within images, but their performance degrades when deployed on out-of-distribution (OOD) data that differs from training data. This challenge has led to OOD detection methods that aim to identify and reject unreliable predictions. Although prior work shows that OOD detection performance varies by artefact type, the underlying causes remain underexplored. To this end, we identify a previously unreported bias in OOD detection: for hard-to-detect artefacts (near-OOD), detection performance typically improves when the artefact shares visual similarity (e.g. colour) with the model's ROI and drops when it does not - a phenomenon we term the Invisible Gorilla Effect. For example, in a skin lesion classifier with red lesion ROI, we show the method Mahalanobis Score achieves a 31.5% higher AUROC when detecting OOD red ink (similar to ROI) compared to black ink (dissimilar) annotations. We annotated artefacts by colour in 11,355 images from three public datasets (e.g. ISIC) and generated colour-swapped counterfactuals to rule out dataset bias. We then evaluated 40 OOD methods across 7 benchmarks and found significant performance drops for most methods when artefacts differed from the ROI. Our findings highlight an overlooked failure mode in OOD detection and provide guidance for more robust detectors. Code and annotations are available at: https://github.com/HarryAnthony/Invisible_Gorilla_Effect.

Abstract: We present SemanticNVS, a camera-conditioned multi-view diffusion model for novel view synthesis (NVS), which improves generation quality and consistency by integrating pre-trained semantic feature extractors. Existing NVS methods perform well for views near the input view, however, they tend to generate semantically implausible and distorted images under long-range camera motion, revealing severe degradation. We speculate that this degradation is due to current models failing to fully understand their conditioning or intermediate generated scene content. Here, we propose to integrate pre-trained semantic feature extractors to incorporate stronger scene semantics as conditioning to achieve high-quality generation even at distant viewpoints. We investigate two different strategies, (1) warped semantic features and (2) an alternating scheme of understanding and generation at each denoising step. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate the clear qualitative and quantitative (4.69%-15.26% in FID) improvement over state-of-the-art alternatives.

Abstract: Data visualization principles, derived from decades of research in design and perception, ensure proper visual communication. While prior work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can generate charts or flag misleading figures, it remains unclear whether they and their vision-language counterparts (VLMs) can reason about and enforce visualization principles directly. Constraint based systems encode these principles as logical rules for precise automated checks, but translating them into formal specifications demands expert knowledge. This motivates leveraging LLMs and VLMs as principle checkers that can reason about visual design directly, bypassing the need for symbolic rule specification. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of both LLMs and VLMs on their ability to reason about visualization principles, using hard verification ground truth derived from Answer Set Programming (ASP). We compiled a set of visualization principles expressed as natural-language statements and generated a controlled dataset of approximately 2,000 Vega-Lite specifications annotated with explicit principle violations, complemented by over 300 real-world Vega-Lite charts. We evaluated both checking and fixing tasks, assessing how well models detect principle violations and correct flawed chart specifications. Our work highlights both the promise of large (vision-)language models as flexible validators and editors of visualization designs and the persistent gap with symbolic solvers on more nuanced aspects of visual perception. They also reveal an interesting asymmetry: frontier models tend to be more effective at correcting violations than at detecting them reliably.

Result: 尖端模型在常见违规检测上表现优异（F1最高0.82），提示遵循性也很高（最高100%），但对于更细微的感知规则表现显著下降（部分类别F1低于0.15），将约束翻译为自然语言提升了较小模型150%的性能。

Conclusion: LLM有潜力作为灵活的语言驱动验证器，但目前与符号求解器相比仍有局限，特别是在理解和处理技术性规范表述方面。

Abstract: Data visualization rules-derived from decades of research in design and perception-ensure trustworthy chart communication. While prior work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can generate charts or flag misleading figures, it remains unclear whether they can reason about and enforce visualization rules directly. Constraint-based systems such as Draco encode these rules as logical constraints for precise automated checks, but maintaining symbolic encodings requires expert effort, motivating the use of LLMs as flexible rule validators. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of LLMs against visualization rules using hard-verification ground truth derived from Answer Set Programming (ASP). We translated a subset of Draco's constraints into natural-language statements and generated a controlled dataset of 2,000 Vega-Lite specifications annotated with explicit rule violations. LLMs were evaluated on both accuracy in detecting violations and prompt adherence, which measures whether outputs follow the required structured format. Results show that frontier models achieve high adherence (Gemma 3 4B / 27B: 100%, GPT-oss 20B: 98%) and reliably detect common violations (F1 up to 0.82),yet performance drops for subtler perceptual rules (F1 < 0.15 for some categories) and for outputs generated from technical ASP formulations.Translating constraints into natural language improved performance by up to 150% for smaller models. These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs as flexible, language-driven validators while highlighting their current limitations compared to symbolic solvers.

Abstract: Current feed-forward 3D/4D reconstruction systems rely on dense geometry and pose supervision -- expensive to obtain at scale and particularly scarce for dynamic real-world scenes. We present Flow3r, a framework that augments visual geometry learning with dense 2D correspondences (`flow') as supervision, enabling scalable training from unlabeled monocular videos. Our key insight is that the flow prediction module should be factored: predicting flow between two images using geometry latents from one and pose latents from the other. This factorization directly guides the learning of both scene geometry and camera motion, and naturally extends to dynamic scenes. In controlled experiments, we show that factored flow prediction outperforms alternative designs and that performance scales consistently with unlabeled data. Integrating factored flow into existing visual geometry architectures and training with ${\sim}800$K unlabeled videos, Flow3r achieves state-of-the-art results across eight benchmarks spanning static and dynamic scenes, with its largest gains on in-the-wild dynamic videos where labeled data is most scarce.

Abstract: We propose tttLRM, a novel large 3D reconstruction model that leverages a Test-Time Training (TTT) layer to enable long-context, autoregressive 3D reconstruction with linear computational complexity, further scaling the model's capability. Our framework efficiently compresses multiple image observations into the fast weights of the TTT layer, forming an implicit 3D representation in the latent space that can be decoded into various explicit formats, such as Gaussian Splats (GS) for downstream applications. The online learning variant of our model supports progressive 3D reconstruction and refinement from streaming observations. We demonstrate that pretraining on novel view synthesis tasks effectively transfers to explicit 3D modeling, resulting in improved reconstruction quality and faster convergence. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves superior performance in feedforward 3D Gaussian reconstruction compared to state-of-the-art approaches on both objects and scenes.

Motivation: 当前统一多模态模型通常数据需求大、模型参数量重，难以部署到边缘设备。研究者希望开发一个紧凑、高效的模型，能够在移动设备上实现实时的多模态理解和生成，消除对云端的依赖。

Method: Mobile-O采用紧凑的视觉-语言-扩散模型架构，其核心模块Mobile Conditioning Projector (MCP)利用深度可分离卷积和层级对齐技术，以最小计算成本实现高效的跨模态条件生成。模型仅用数百万样本训练，并以新颖的四元组格式（生成提示、图像、问题、答案）进行后训练，从而同时提升视觉理解和生成能力。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models can both understand and generate visual content within a single architecture. Existing models, however, remain data-hungry and too heavy for deployment on edge devices. We present Mobile-O, a compact vision-language-diffusion model that brings unified multimodal intelligence to a mobile device. Its core module, the Mobile Conditioning Projector (MCP), fuses vision-language features with a diffusion generator using depthwise-separable convolutions and layerwise alignment. This design enables efficient cross-modal conditioning with minimal computational cost. Trained on only a few million samples and post-trained in a novel quadruplet format (generation prompt, image, question, answer), Mobile-O jointly enhances both visual understanding and generation capabilities. Despite its efficiency, Mobile-O attains competitive or superior performance compared to other unified models, achieving 74% on GenEval and outperforming Show-O and JanusFlow by 5% and 11%, while running 6x and 11x faster, respectively. For visual understanding, Mobile-O surpasses them by 15.3% and 5.1% averaged across seven benchmarks. Running in only ~3s per 512x512 image on an iPhone, Mobile-O establishes the first practical framework for real-time unified multimodal understanding and generation on edge devices. We hope Mobile-O will ease future research in real-time unified multimodal intelligence running entirely on-device with no cloud dependency.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A dominant paradigm in visual intelligence treats semantics as a static property of latent representations, assuming that meaning can be discovered through geometric proximity in high dimensional embedding spaces. In this work, we argue that this view is physically incomplete. We propose that intelligence is not a passive mirror of reality but a property of a physically realizable agent, a system bounded by finite memory, finite compute, and finite energy interacting with a high entropy environment. We formalize this interaction through the kinematic structure of an Observation Semantics Fiber Bundle, where raw sensory observation data (the fiber) is projected onto a low entropy causal semantic manifold (the base). We prove that for any bounded agent, the thermodynamic cost of information processing (Landauer's Principle) imposes a strict limit on the complexity of internal state transitions. We term this limit the Semantic Constant B. From these physical constraints, we derive the necessity of symbolic structure. We show that to model a combinatorial world within the bound B, the semantic manifold must undergo a phase transition, it must crystallize into a discrete, compositional, and factorized form. Thus, language and logic are not cultural artifacts but ontological necessities the solid state of information required to prevent thermal collapse. We conclude that understanding is not the recovery of a hidden latent variable, but the construction of a causal quotient that renders the world algorithmically compressible and causally predictable.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: When training artificial intelligence (AI) to perform tasks, humans often care not only about whether a task is completed but also how it is performed. As AI agents tackle increasingly complex tasks, aligning their behavior with human-provided specifications becomes critical for responsible AI deployment. Reward design provides a direct channel for such alignment by translating human expectations into reward functions that guide reinforcement learning (RL). However, existing methods are often too limited to capture nuanced human preferences that arise in long-horizon tasks. Hence, we introduce Hierarchical Reward Design from Language (HRDL): a problem formulation that extends classical reward design to encode richer behavioral specifications for hierarchical RL agents. We further propose Language to Hierarchical Rewards (L2HR) as a solution to HRDL. Experiments show that AI agents trained with rewards designed via L2HR not only complete tasks effectively but also better adhere to human specifications. Together, HRDL and L2HR advance the research on human-aligned AI agents.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: In CAS adaptation, a challenge is to define the dynamic architecture of the system and changes in its behavior. Implementation-wise, this is projected into an adaptation mechanism, typically realized as an Adaptation Manager (AM). With the advances of generative LLMs, generating AM code based on system specification and desired AM behavior (partially in natural language) is a tempting opportunity. The recent introduction of vibe coding suggests a way to target the problem of the correctness of generated code by iterative testing and vibe coding feedback loops instead of direct code inspection.
  In this paper, we show that generating an AM via vibe coding feedback loops is a viable option when the verification of the generated AM is based on a very precise formulation of the functional requirements. We specify these as constraints in a novel temporal logic FCL that allows us to express the behavior of traces with much finer granularity than classical LTL enables.
  Furthermore, we show that by combining the adaptation and vibe coding feedback loops where the FCL constraints are evaluated for the current system state, we achieved good results in the experiments with generating AMs for two example systems from the CAS domain. Typically, just a few feedback loop iterations were necessary, each feeding the LLM with reports describing detailed violations of the constraints. This AM testing was combined with high run path coverage achieved by different initial settings.

Abstract: Modern large-scale ranking systems operate within a sophisticated landscape of competing objectives, operational constraints, and evolving product requirements. Progress in this domain is increasingly bottlenecked by the engineering context constraint: the arduous process of translating ambiguous product intent into reasonable, executable, verifiable hypotheses, rather than by modeling techniques alone. We present GEARS (Generative Engine for Agentic Ranking Systems), a framework that reframes ranking optimization as an autonomous discovery process within a programmable experimentation environment. Rather than treating optimization as static model selection, GEARS leverages Specialized Agent Skills to encapsulate ranking expert knowledge into reusable reasoning capabilities, enabling operators to steer systems via high-level intent vibe personalization. Furthermore, to ensure production reliability, the framework incorporates validation hooks to enforce statistical robustness and filter out brittle policies that overfit short-term signals. Experimental validation across diverse product surfaces demonstrates that GEARS consistently identifies superior, near-Pareto-efficient policies by synergizing algorithmic signals with deep ranking context while maintaining rigorous deployment stability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM幻觉检测方法通常需要训练专门的探测分类器或进行激活消融，成本较高。本文旨在开发一种无需训练的原理性方法来检测解码过程中的能量泄漏，这些能量泄漏与事实错误和偏差相关。

Method: 将LLM最后的softmax分类器重新解释为能量模型，将序列到序列的概率链分解为多个在推理时相互作用的能量模型。引入了两种完全无需训练的指标：能量溢出（捕捉连续生成步骤中理论上应匹配的能量值之间的差异）和边际能量（在单一步骤中可测量）。

Result: 在九个基准测试和多个最先进的LLM（包括LLaMA、Mistral、Gemma）上进行评估，该方法在幻觉检测和跨任务泛化方面表现出鲁棒且竞争性的性能，且结果适用于预训练和指令微调变体而不引入任何训练开销。

Conclusion: 通过能量模型框架为LLM幻觉检测提供了一种原理性、无需训练的方法，能够有效追踪解码过程中的能量泄漏，为模型解释和可靠性评估提供了新工具。

Abstract: We reinterpret the final Large Language Model (LLM) softmax classifier as an Energy-Based Model (EBM), decomposing the sequence-to-sequence probability chain into multiple interacting EBMs at inference. This principled approach allows us to track "energy spills" during decoding, which we empirically show correlate with factual errors, biases, and failures. Similar to Orgad et al. (2025), our method localizes the exact answer token and subsequently tests for hallucinations. Crucially, however, we achieve this without requiring trained probe classifiers or activation ablations. Instead, we introduce two completely training-free metrics derived directly from output logits: spilled energy, which captures the discrepancy between energy values across consecutive generation steps that should theoretically match, and marginalized energy, which is measurable at a single step. Evaluated on nine benchmarks across state-of-the-art LLMs (including LLaMA, Mistral, and Gemma) and on synthetic algebraic operations (Qwen3), our approach demonstrates robust, competitive hallucination detection and cross-task generalization. Notably, these results hold for both pretrained and instruction-tuned variants without introducing any training overhead.

Motivation: 实证研究的结论不仅取决于数据，还取决于一系列分析决策，而这些决策在已发表结果中很少明确说明。传统的多人分析研究虽能揭示这种分析多样性，但需要大量研究团队花费数月协调，难以大规模实施。

Method: 构建基于大型语言模型的自主AI分析员，让它们在固定数据集上测试预设假设，通过变化底层模型和提示框架在多个重复运行中生成独立分析。每个AI分析员独立构建并执行完整的分析流程，然后由AI审计员筛选方法学上有效的运行。

Result: 在涵盖实验性和观察性设计的三个数据集中，AI分析员产生的分析在效应大小、p值和假设支持决策上显示出广泛分散，经常逆转假设是否被判断为支持的情况。这种分散是结构化的：在预处理、模型规范和推断方面的分析选择在不同LLM和角色条件下存在系统性差异。

Conclusion: AI分析员能够以极低成本再现结构化分析多样性，分析结果在统计决策上存在广泛变异且具有可操纵性；改变分析员角色或LLM模型会影响结果分布，即使排除方法学缺陷的运行后仍然存在。这表明分析决策对研究结论有重要影响，AI工具可以成为研究稳健性和透明度的重要工具。

Abstract: The conclusions of empirical research depend not only on data but on a sequence of analytic decisions that published results seldom make explicit. Past ``many-analyst" studies have demonstrated this: independent teams testing the same hypothesis on the same dataset regularly reach conflicting conclusions. But such studies require months of coordination among dozens of research groups and are therefore rarely conducted. In this work, we show that fully autonomous AI analysts built on large language models (LLMs) can reproduce a similar structured analytic diversity cheaply and at scale. We task these AI analysts with testing a pre-specified hypothesis on a fixed dataset, varying the underlying model and prompt framing across replicate runs. Each AI analyst independently constructs and executes a full analysis pipeline; an AI auditor then screens each run for methodological validity. Across three datasets spanning experimental and observational designs, AI analyst-produced analyses display wide dispersion in effect sizes, $p$-values, and binary decisions on supporting the hypothesis or not, frequently reversing whether a hypothesis is judged supported. This dispersion is structured: recognizable analytic choices in preprocessing, model specification, and inference differ systematically across LLM and persona conditions. Critically, the effects are \emph{steerable}: reassigning the analyst persona or LLM shifts the distribution of outcomes even after excluding methodologically deficient runs.

Motivation: 在稀疏奖励的视觉强化学习中，加速探索仍面临挑战，因为存在大量与任务无关的变化。现有内在探索方法要么假设可以访问低维状态，要么缺乏任务感知的探索策略，导致在视觉领域表现脆弱。

Conclusion: TEB通过将任务相关表征与探索紧密耦合，提供了一种解决稀疏奖励视觉强化学习中探索问题的有效方法，具有优异的性能和实用性。

Abstract: Accelerating exploration in visual reinforcement learning under sparse rewards remains challenging due to the substantial task-irrelevant variations. Despite advances in intrinsic exploration, many methods either assume access to low-dimensional states or lack task-aware exploration strategies, thereby rendering them fragile in visual domains. To bridge this gap, we present TEB, a Task-aware Exploration approach that tightly couples task-relevant representations with exploration through a predictive Bisimulation metric. Specifically, TEB leverages the metric not only to learn behaviorally grounded task representations but also to measure behaviorally intrinsic novelty over the learned latent space. To realize this, we first theoretically mitigate the representation collapse of degenerate bisimulation metrics under sparse rewards by internally introducing a simple but effective predicted reward differential. Building on this robust metric, we design potential-based exploration bonuses, which measure the relative novelty of adjacent observations over the latent space. Extensive experiments on MetaWorld and Maze2D show that TEB achieves superior exploration ability and outperforms recent baselines.

Abstract: Chart summarization is crucial for enhancing data accessibility and the efficient consumption of information. However, existing methods, including those with Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focus on low-level data descriptions and often fail to capture the deeper insights which are the fundamental purpose of data visualization. To address this challenge, we propose Chart Insight Agent Flow, a plan-and-execute multi-agent framework effectively leveraging the perceptual and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs to uncover profound insights directly from chart images. Furthermore, to overcome the lack of suitable benchmarks, we introduce ChartSummInsights, a new dataset featuring a diverse collection of real-world charts paired with high-quality, insightful summaries authored by human data analysis experts. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of MLLMs on the chart summarization task, producing summaries with deep and diverse insights.

TL;DR: LaDa是一个用于联邦大语言模型(LLM)与小语言模型(SLM)推理协作的框架，通过模型可学习性感知数据分配和领域自适应推理蒸馏，解决双向模型可学习性差距和领域无关推理转移等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据分配方法无法解决联邦LLM-SLM协作中的两个关键挑战：1) 双向模型可学习性差距（SLM无法识别匹配其学习约束的高价值样本，LLM难以选择能贡献新知识的样本）；2) 领域无关推理转移（现有推理转移方法无法灵活适应本地领域数据）。

Method: 提出LaDa框架，包含：1) 模型可学习性感知数据过滤器，根据SLM-LLM对之间的学习性差距自适应分配高价值样本；2) 领域自适应推理蒸馏方法，通过对滤波样本上的推理路径联合概率进行对比蒸馏学习，使SLM能够捕捉本地数据分布下的推理模式。LaDa可作为现有协作框架的插件模块。

Result: 该框架有效促进了双向知识转移，使SLM能够在本地数据分布下有效获取来自LLM的分步推理能力。

Conclusion: LaDa通过解决双向模型可学习性差距和领域自适应推理转移问题，为联邦LLM-SLM协作提供了有效的推理蒸馏框架，能够基于模型可学习性差距自适应调整知识转移过程。

Abstract: Data allocation plays a critical role in federated large language model (LLM) and small language models (SLMs) reasoning collaboration. Nevertheless, existing data allocation methods fail to address an under-explored challenge in collaboration: bidirectional model learnability gap, where client-side SLMs cannot identify high-reward samples matching their learnability constraints for effective knowledge transfer from LLMs, while LLMs struggle to select samples contributing novel knowledge beyond their existing data. Furthermore, these collaboration frameworks face another key challenge: domain-agnostic reasoning transfer, where existing reasoning transfer methods fail to flexibly adapt to the local domain data, preventing SLMs from effectively acquiring step-by-step reasoning abilities within from general LLM. To address these challenges, we propose LaDa, a federated reasoning distillation framework with model learnability-aware data allocation. It introduces a model learnability-aware data filter that adaptively allocates high-reward samples based on the learnability gap between each SLM and LLM pair, effectively facilitating bidirectional knowledge transfer. We further design a domain adaptive reasoning distillation method that aligns joint probabilities of reasoning paths on filtered high-reward samples through contrastive distillation learning between SLM and LLM, enabling SLM to capture underlying reasoning patterns under local data distribution. LaDa operates as a plug-in module for existing collaboration frameworks, adapting knowledge transfer based on model learnability gaps.

Abstract: This paper establishes a fundamental convergence: Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) represent two manifestations of a unified paradigm for deterministic, auditable LLM-agent interaction. SGD, designed for dialogue-based API discovery (2019), and MCP, now the de facto standard for LLM-tool integration, share the same core insight -- that schemas can encode not just tool signatures but operational constraints and reasoning guidance. By analyzing this convergence, we extract five foundational principles for schema design: (1) Semantic Completeness over Syntactic Precision, (2) Explicit Action Boundaries, (3) Failure Mode Documentation, (4) Progressive Disclosure Compatibility, and (5) Inter-Tool Relationship Declaration. These principles reveal three novel insights: first, SGD's original design was fundamentally sound and should be inherited by MCP; second, both frameworks leave failure modes and inter-tool relationships unexploited -- gaps we identify and resolve; third, progressive disclosure emerges as a critical production-scaling insight under real-world token constraints. We provide concrete design patterns for each principle. These principles position schema-driven governance as a scalable mechanism for AI system oversight without requiring proprietary system inspection -- central to Software 3.0.

Abstract: The emergence of tool-calling-based agent systems introduces a more evidence-driven paradigm for pathology image analysis in contrast to the coarse-grained text-image diagnostic approaches. With the recent large-scale experimental adoption of spatial transcriptomics technologies, molecularly validated pathological diagnosis is becoming increasingly open and accessible. In this work, we propose LAMMI-Pathology (LVLM-Agent System for Molecularly Informed Medical Intelligence in Pathology), a scalable agent framework for domain-specific agent tool-calling. LAMMI-Pathology adopts a tool-centric, bottom-up architecture in which customized domain-adaptive tools serve as the foundation. These tools are clustered by domain style to form component agents, which are then coordinated through a top-level planner hierarchically, avoiding excessively long context lengths that could induce task drift. Based on that, we introduce a novel trajectory construction mechanism based on Atomic Execution Nodes (AENs), which serve as reliable and composable units for building semi-simulated reasoning trajectories that capture credible agent-tool interactions. Building on this foundation, we develop a trajectory-aware fine-tuning strategy that aligns the planner's decision-making process with these multi-step reasoning trajectories, thereby enhancing inference robustness in pathology understanding and its adaptive use of the customized toolset.

Abstract: Path planning in complex environments is one of the key problems of artificial intelligence because it requires simultaneous understanding of the geometry of space and the global structure of the problem. In this paper, we explore the potential of using generative models as planning and reasoning mechanisms. We propose GenPlanner, an approach based on diffusion models and flow matching, along with two variants: DiffPlanner and FlowPlanner. We demonstrate the application of generative models to find and generate correct paths in mazes. A multi-channel condition describing the structure of the environment, including an obstacle map and information about the starting and destination points, is used to condition trajectory generation. Unlike standard methods, our models generate trajectories iteratively, starting with random noise and gradually transforming it into a correct solution. Experiments conducted show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the baseline CNN model. In particular, FlowPlanner demonstrates high performance even with a limited number of generation steps.

TL;DR: 提出了TPRU数据集和强化学习微调方法，显著提升了小型多模态大语言模型的时序推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前可部署的小型多模态大语言模型在理解和处理时序、过程性视觉数据方面存在严重不足，阻碍了它们在现实世界具身AI中的应用。这一缺陷主要源于训练范式缺乏大规模、过程连贯的数据。

Method: 1. 构建TPRU大规模数据集，涵盖机器人操作和GUI导航等具身场景；2. 设计三个互补的时序推理任务：时序重排序、下一帧预测和前一帧回顾；3. 包含挑战性负样本，促使模型从被动观察到主动跨模态验证；4. 采用强化学习微调方法优化资源效率模型。

Result: 1. TPRU-7B模型在TPRU-Test上的准确率从50.33%大幅提升到75.70%，达到最先进水平；2. 显著超越包括GPT-4o在内的更大基线模型；3. 模型能力具有良好的泛化性，在已有基准测试上也表现出显著改进。

Conclusion: TPRU数据集和强化学习微调方法有效解决了小型MLLMs的时序推理瓶颈，显著提升了模型在具身AI场景中的实际应用能力，且这些改进具有良好的泛化性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly smaller, deployable variants, exhibit a critical deficiency in understanding temporal and procedural visual data, a bottleneck hindering their application in real-world embodied AI. This gap is largely caused by a systemic failure in training paradigms, which lack large-scale, procedurally coherent data. To address this problem, we introduce TPRU, a large-scale dataset sourced from diverse embodied scenarios such as robotic manipulation and GUI navigation. TPRU is systematically designed to cultivate temporal reasoning through three complementary tasks: Temporal Reordering, Next-Frame Prediction, and Previous-Frame Review. A key feature is the inclusion of challenging negative samples, compelling models to transition from passive observation to active, cross-modal validation. We leverage TPRU with a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methodology, specifically targeting the enhancement of resource-efficient models. Experiments show our approach yields dramatic gains: on our manually curated TPRU-Test, the accuracy of TPRU-7B soars from 50.33\% to 75.70\%, a state-of-the-art result that significantly outperforms vastly larger baselines, including GPT-4o. Crucially, these capabilities generalize effectively, demonstrating substantial improvements on established benchmarks. The codebase is available at https://github.com/Stephen-gzk/TPRU/ .

TL;DR: 这项研究探索了使用消费级LLM（如ChatGPT-5.2 Thinking）协助数学猜想证明的可行性，通过具体案例（解决Ran和Teng猜想）展示了LLM在'氛围证明'工作流中的价值，但指出人工专家在关键验证环节仍不可或缺。

Motivation: 虽然LLMs越来越多地被用作科研助手，但在研究级数学任务中，尤其是面向个体研究者的工作流，其实际作用和局限性尚未充分验证。研究旨在通过具体案例填补这一空白，探讨LLM辅助数学证明的实用性与边界。

Method: 采用可审计的案例研究方法，使用ChatGPT-5.2（Thinking）协助解决一个具体的数学猜想。研究者分析7个可共享的对话线程和4个版本化的证明草稿，记录了一个'生成-审核-修复'的迭代流程。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as scientific copilots, but evidence on their role in research-level mathematics remains limited, especially for workflows accessible to individual researchers. We present early evidence for vibe-proving with a consumer subscription LLM through an auditable case study that resolves Conjecture 20 of Ran and Teng (2024) on the exact nonreal spectral region of a 4-cycle row-stochastic nonnegative matrix family. We analyze seven shareable ChatGPT-5.2 (Thinking) threads and four versioned proof drafts, documenting an iterative pipeline of generate, referee, and repair. The model is most useful for high-level proof search, while human experts remain essential for correctness-critical closure. The final theorem provides necessary and sufficient region conditions and explicit boundary attainment constructions. Beyond the mathematical result, we contribute a process-level characterization of where LLM assistance materially helps and where verification bottlenecks persist, with implications for evaluation of AI-assisted research workflows and for designing human-in-the-loop theorem proving systems.

Motivation: 传统PCG方法将游戏机制视为辅助因素，主要优化空间几何，这限制了可控性和表达能力。作者主张将非几何的游戏性维度提升为状态空间的独立坐标，实现更统一的处理和分析。

Method: HDPCG框架通过在联合状态空间中引入非几何坐标。具体实现包括：1）方向空间：将几何与离散层维度结合，验证4D可达性；2）方向时间：通过时间扩展图引入时间动态。每个方向都提供了生成抽象骨架、受控接地、高维验证和多指标评估的共享流程。

Conclusion: HDPCG有望推动PCG向通用表示转变，生成超越几何的游戏相关维度，为可控、可验证、可扩展的关卡生成铺平道路。

Abstract: Procedural content generation (PCG) has made substantial progress in shaping static 2D/3D geometry, while most methods treat gameplay mechanics as auxiliary and optimize only over space. We argue that this limits controllability and expressivity, and formally introduce High-Dimensional PCG (HDPCG): a framework that elevates non-geometric gameplay dimensions to first-class coordinates of a joint state space. We instantiate HDPCG along two concrete directions. Direction-Space augments geometry with a discrete layer dimension and validates reachability in 4D (x,y,z,l), enabling unified treatment of 2.5D/3.5D mechanics such as gravity inversion and parallel-world switching. Direction-Time augments geometry with temporal dynamics via time-expanded graphs, capturing action semantics and conflict rules. For each direction, we present three general, practicable algorithms with a shared pipeline of abstract skeleton generation, controlled grounding, high-dimensional validation, and multi-metric evaluation. Large-scale experiments across diverse settings validate the integrity of our problem formulation and the effectiveness of our methods on playability, structure, style, robustness, and efficiency. Beyond quantitative results, Unity-based case studies recreate playable scenarios that accord with our metrics. We hope HDPCG encourages a shift in PCG toward general representations and the generation of gameplay-relevant dimensions beyond geometry, paving the way for controllable, verifiable, and extensible level generation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large scale control of nonplayer agents is central to modern games, while production systems still struggle to balance several competing goals: locally smooth, natural behavior, and globally coordinated variety across space and time. Prior approaches rely on handcrafted rules or purely stochastic triggers, which either converge to mechanical synchrony or devolve into uncorrelated noise that is hard to tune. Continuous noise signals such as Perlin noise are well suited to this gap because they provide spatially and temporally coherent randomness, and they are already widely used for terrain, biomes, and other procedural assets. We adapt these signals for the first time to large scale AI control and present a general framework that treats continuous noise fields as an AI coordinator. The framework combines three layers of control: behavior parameterization for movement at the agent level, action time scheduling for when behaviors start and stop, and spawn or event type and feature generation for what appears and where. We instantiate the framework reproducibly and evaluate Perlin noise as a representative coordinator across multiple maps, scales, and seeds against random, filtered, deterministic, neighborhood constrained, and physics inspired baselines. Experiments show that coordinated noise fields provide stable activation statistics without lockstep, strong spatial coverage and regional balance, better diversity with controllable polarization, and competitive runtime. We hope this work motivates a broader exploration of coordinated noise in game AI as a practical path to combine efficiency, controllability, and quality.

Abstract: We introduce INDUCTION, a benchmark for finite structure concept synthesis in first order logic. Given small finite relational worlds with extensionally labeled target predicates, models must output a single first order logical formula that explains the target uniformly across worlds, with correctness verified via exact model checking. The benchmark includes three regimes, FullObs, CI (contrastive), and EC (existential completion), nd penalizes formula bloat. We find sharp difficulty gradients, persistent hard structural families, and observe that low bloat formulas generalize far better on held out worlds. Elite recent models show qualitatively different behaviors across tasks and performance metrics, hinting to their different strategies of concept generalization.

Abstract: The remarkable performance of modern AI systems has been driven by unprecedented scales of data, computation, and energy -- far exceeding the resources required by human intelligence. This disparity highlights the need for new guiding principles and motivates drawing inspiration from the fundamental organizational principles of brain computation. Among these principles, modularity has been shown to be critical for supporting the efficient learning and strong generalization abilities consistently exhibited by humans. Furthermore, modularity aligns well with the No Free Lunch Theorem, which highlights the need for problem-specific inductive biases and motivates architectures composed of specialized components that solve subproblems. However, despite its fundamental role in natural intelligence and its demonstrated benefits across a range of seemingly disparate AI subfields, modularity remains relatively underappreciated in mainstream AI research. In this work, we review several research threads in artificial intelligence and neuroscience through a conceptual framework that highlights the central role of modularity in supporting both artificial and natural intelligence. In particular, we examine what computational advantages modularity provides, how it has emerged as a solution across several AI research areas, which modularity principles the brain exploits, and how modularity can help bridge the gap between natural and artificial intelligence.

Abstract: Tool invocation is a core capability of agentic systems, yet failures often arise not from individual tool calls but from how multiple tools are organized and executed together. Existing approaches tightly couple tool execution with stepwise language reasoning or explicit planning, leading to brittle behavior and high execution overhead. To overcome these limitations, we revisit tool invocation from the perspective of tool orchestration. Our key insight is that effective orchestration does not require precise dependency graphs or fine-grained planning. Instead, a coarse-grained layer structure suffices to provide global guidance, while execution-time errors can be corrected locally. Specifically, we model tool orchestration as learning a layered execution structure that captures high-level tool dependencies, inducing layer-wise execution through context constraints. To handle execution-time failures, we introduce a schema-aware reflective correction mechanism that detects and repairs errors locally. This design confines errors to individual tool calls and avoids re-planning entire execution trajectories. This structured execution paradigm enables a lightweight and reusable orchestration component for agentic systems. Experimental results show that our approach achieves robust tool execution while reducing execution complexity and overhead. Code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Preference-driven behavior in LLMs may be a necessary precondition for AI misalignment such as sandbagging: models cannot strategically pursue misaligned goals unless their behavior is influenced by their preferences. Yet prior work has typically prompted models explicitly to act in specific ways, leaving unclear whether observed behaviors reflect instruction-following capabilities vs underlying model preferences. Here we test whether this precondition for misalignment is present. Using entity preferences as a behavioral probe, we measure whether stated preferences predict downstream behavior in five frontier LLMs across three domains: donation advice, refusal behavior, and task performance. Conceptually replicating prior work, we first confirm that all five models show highly consistent preferences across two independent measurement methods. We then test behavioral consequences in a simulated user environment. We find that all five models give preference-aligned donation advice. All five models also show preference-correlated refusal patterns when asked to recommend donations, refusing more often for less-preferred entities. All preference-related behaviors that we observe here emerge without instructions to act on preferences. Results for task performance are mixed: on a question-answering benchmark (BoolQ), two models show small but significant accuracy differences favoring preferred entities; one model shows the opposite pattern; and two models show no significant relationship. On complex agentic tasks, we find no evidence of preference-driven performance differences. While LLMs have consistent preferences that reliably predict advice-giving behavior, these preferences do not consistently translate into downstream task performance.

Abstract: Organizations across finance, healthcare, transportation, content moderation, and critical infrastructure are rapidly deploying highly automated AI systems, yet they lack principled methods to quantify how increasing automation amplifies harm when failures occur. We propose a parsimonious Bayesian risk decomposition expressing expected loss as the product of three terms: the probability of system failure, the conditional probability that a failure propagates into harm given the automation level, and the expected severity of harm. This framework isolates a critical quantity -- the conditional probability that failures propagate into harm -- which captures execution and oversight risk rather than model accuracy alone. We develop complete theoretical foundations: formal proofs of the decomposition, a harm propagation equivalence theorem linking the harm propagation probability to observable execution controls, risk elasticity measures, efficient frontier analysis for automation policy, and optimal resource allocation principles with second-order conditions. We motivate the framework with an illustrative case study of the 2012 Knight Capital incident ($440M loss) as one instantiation of a broadly applicable failure pattern, and characterize the research design required to empirically validate the framework at scale across deployment domains. This work provides the theoretical foundations for a new class of deployment-focused risk governance tools for agentic and automated AI systems.

Abstract: LLM agents are increasingly expected to function as general-purpose systems capable of resolving open-ended user requests. While existing benchmarks focus on domain-aware environments for developing specialized agents, evaluating general-purpose agents requires more realistic settings that challenge them to operate across multiple skills and tools within a unified environment. We introduce General AgentBench, a benchmark that provides such a unified framework for evaluating general LLM agents across search, coding, reasoning, and tool-use domains. Using General AgentBench, we systematically study test-time scaling behaviors under sequential scaling (iterative interaction) and parallel scaling (sampling multiple trajectories). Evaluation of ten leading LLM agents reveals a substantial performance degradation when moving from domain-specific evaluations to this general-agent setting. Moreover, we find that neither scaling methodology yields effective performance improvements in practice, due to two fundamental limitations: context ceiling in sequential scaling and verification gap in parallel scaling.

TL;DR: MagicAgent是一个针对通用智能体规划的系列基础模型，通过轻量级合成数据框架生成多样化规划任务的高质量轨迹，并采用两阶段训练范式来缓解任务间的梯度干扰，在多个基准测试中显著领先于现有模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型从被动文本处理向自主智能体演进，规划成为智能化核心，但通用规划仍然难以实现，原因包括高质量交互数据的稀缺以及异构规划任务间的内在冲突，导致模型在单一任务上表现优异但泛化能力不足，现有多任务训练方法受到梯度干扰的困扰。

Method: 提出轻量级可扩展的合成数据框架，生成涵盖层次任务分解、工具增强规划、多约束调度、程序逻辑编排和长程工具执行等多样化规划任务的高质量轨迹；采用两阶段训练范式：先进行监督微调，然后在静态数据集和动态环境上进行多目标强化学习。

Result: MagicAgent-32B和MagicAgent-30B-A3B在多个基准测试中表现优异：Worfbench准确率75.1%、NaturalPlan 55.9%、τ²-Bench 57.5%、BFCL-v3 86.9%、ACEBench 81.2%，并在内部MagicEval基准上取得强劲结果，大幅超越现有百亿参数以下模型，甚至超过了领先的闭源模型。

Conclusion: MagicAgent系列模型通过创新性的合成数据生成和两阶段训练方法，成功解决了通用智能体规划中的数据稀缺和任务冲突问题，在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，为构建真正通用的规划智能体奠定了重要基础。

Abstract: The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) from passive text processors to autonomous agents has established planning as a core component of modern intelligence. However, achieving generalized planning remains elusive, not only by the scarcity of high-quality interaction data but also by inherent conflicts across heterogeneous planning tasks. These challenges result in models that excel at isolated tasks yet struggle to generalize, while existing multi-task training attempts suffer from gradient interference. In this paper, we present \textbf{MagicAgent}, a series of foundation models specifically designed for generalized agent planning. We introduce a lightweight and scalable synthetic data framework that generates high-quality trajectories across diverse planning tasks, including hierarchical task decomposition, tool-augmented planning, multi-constraint scheduling, procedural logic orchestration, and long-horizon tool execution. To mitigate training conflicts, we propose a two-stage training paradigm comprising supervised fine-tuning followed by multi-objective reinforcement learning over both static datasets and dynamic environments. Empirical results demonstrate that MagicAgent-32B and MagicAgent-30B-A3B deliver superior performance, achieving accuracies of $75.1\%$ on Worfbench, $55.9\%$ on NaturalPlan, $57.5\%$ on $τ^2$-Bench, $86.9\%$ on BFCL-v3, and $81.2\%$ on ACEBench, as well as strong results on our in-house MagicEval benchmarks. These results substantially outperform existing sub-100B models and even surpass leading closed-source models.

Abstract: We present a systematic evaluation of large language models on quantum mechanics problem-solving. Our study evaluates 15 models from five providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Alibaba, DeepSeek) spanning three capability tiers on 20 tasks covering derivations, creative problems, non-standard concepts, and numerical computation, comprising 900 baseline and 75 tool-augmented assessments. Results reveal clear tier stratification: flagship models achieve 81\% average accuracy, outperforming mid-tier (77\%) and fast models (67\%) by 4pp and 14pp respectively. Task difficulty patterns emerge distinctly: derivations show highest performance (92\% average, 100\% for flagship models), while numerical computation remains most challenging (42\%). Tool augmentation on numerical tasks yields task-dependent effects: modest overall improvement (+4.4pp) at 3x token cost masks dramatic heterogeneity ranging from +29pp gains to -16pp degradation. Reproducibility analysis across three runs quantifies 6.3pp average variance, with flagship models demonstrating exceptional stability (GPT-5 achieves zero variance) while specialized models require multi-run evaluation. This work contributes: (i) a benchmark for quantum mechanics with automatic verification, (ii) systematic evaluation quantifying tier-based performance hierarchies, (iii) empirical analysis of tool augmentation trade-offs, and (iv) reproducibility characterization. All tasks, verifiers, and results are publicly released.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed tremendous progress in enabling LLMs to solve complex reasoning tasks such as math and coding. As we start to apply LLMs to harder tasks that they may not be able to solve in one shot, it is worth paying attention to their ability to construct intermediate stepping stones that prepare them to better solve the tasks. Examples of stepping stones include simplifications, alternative framings, or subproblems. We study properties and benefits of stepping stones in the context of modern reasoning LLMs via ARQ (\textbf{A}king the \textbf{R}ight \textbf{Q}uestions), our simple framework which introduces a question generator to the default reasoning pipeline. We first show that good stepping stone questions exist and are transferrable, meaning that good questions can be generated, and they substantially help LLMs of various capabilities in solving the target tasks. We next frame stepping stone generation as a post-training task and show that we can fine-tune LLMs to generate more useful stepping stones by SFT and RL on synthetic data.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become popular in the last few years. The Artificial Intelligence (AI) community in general, and the Machine Learning (ML) community in particular, is coming to the realisation that in many applications, for AI to be trusted, it must not only demonstrate good performance in its decisionmaking, but it also must explain these decisions and convince us that it is making the decisions for the right reasons. However, different applications have different requirements on the information required of the underlying AI system in order to convince us that it is worthy of our trust. How do we define these requirements?
  In this paper, we present three dimensions for categorising the explanatory requirements of different applications. These are Source, Depth and Scope. We focus on the problem of matching up the explanatory requirements of different applications with the capabilities of underlying ML techniques to provide them. We deliberately avoid including aspects of explanation that are already well-covered by the existing literature and we focus our discussion on ML although the principles apply to AI more broadly.

Abstract: We study three-digit addition in Meta-Llama-3-8B (base) under a one-token readout to characterize how
  arithmetic answers are finalized after cross-token routing becomes causally irrelevant.
  Causal residual patching and cumulative attention ablations localize a sharp boundary near layer~17:
  beyond it, the decoded sum is controlled almost entirely by the last input token and late-layer self-attention
  is largely dispensable.
  In this post-routing regime, digit(-sum) direction dictionaries vary with a next-higher-digit context but are
  well-related by an approximately orthogonal map inside a shared low-rank subspace (low-rank Procrustes alignment).
  Causal digit editing matches this geometry: naive cross-context transfer fails, while rotating directions through the
  learned map restores strict counterfactual edits; negative controls do not recover.

*Shiyi Cao,Ziming Mao,Joseph E. Gonzalez,Ion Stoica*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Search via Co-Evolving World Model的新方法，并用其构建了K-Search框架，以更好地优化GPU内核，解决了现有自动化方法在处理需要多步结构变换的复杂内核时缺乏规划能力和丢弃有前途策略的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化GPU内核对于现代机器学习系统效率至关重要，但由于设计因素的复杂相互作用和硬件的快速演进，这一任务仍具有挑战性。现有自动化方法通常将大型语言模型（LLMs）仅仅视为随机代码生成器，内置于启发式引导的进化循环中，这些方法在需要协调、多步结构变换的复杂内核上表现不佳，因为它们缺乏明确的规划能力，且常因低效或不正确的中间实现而丢弃有前途的策略。

Method: 提出了Search via Co-Evolving World Model方法，通过用协同进化的世界模型替代静态搜索启发式，该框架利用LLMs的先验领域知识引导搜索，积极探索优化空间。此方法明确分离高层算法规划与底层程序实例化，使系统能够在非单调优化路径上导航，同时对临时实现缺陷保持韧性。基于此方法构建了K-Search框架。

Result: 在FlashInfer中的多样化复杂内核（包括GQA、MLA和MoE内核）上评估K-Search，结果表明K-Search显著优于现有最先进的进化搜索方法，平均实现2.10倍提升，在复杂MoE内核上最高达14.3倍增益。在GPUMode TriMul任务中，K-Search在H100上实现了最先进的性能，达到1030微秒，超越了先前进化和人工设计的解决方案。

Conclusion: K-Search框架通过协同进化的世界模型方法，在优化GPU内核方面展现出显著优势，特别是在处理需要复杂结构变换的内核时，其性能大幅超越现有自动化方法，为高效机器学习系统提供了有效的优化工具。

Abstract: Optimizing GPU kernels is critical for efficient modern machine learning systems yet remains challenging due to the complex interplay of design factors and rapid hardware evolution. Existing automated approaches typically treat Large Language Models (LLMs) merely as stochastic code generators within heuristic-guided evolutionary loops. These methods often struggle with complex kernels requiring coordinated, multi-step structural transformations, as they lack explicit planning capabilities and frequently discard promising strategies due to inefficient or incorrect intermediate implementations. To address this, we propose Search via Co-Evolving World Model and build K-Search based on this method. By replacing static search heuristics with a co-evolving world model, our framework leverages LLMs' prior domain knowledge to guide the search, actively exploring the optimization space. This approach explicitly decouples high-level algorithmic planning from low-level program instantiation, enabling the system to navigate non-monotonic optimization paths while remaining resilient to temporary implementation defects. We evaluate K-Search on diverse, complex kernels from FlashInfer, including GQA, MLA, and MoE kernels. Our results show that K-Search significantly outperforms state-of-the-art evolutionary search methods, achieving an average 2.10x improvement and up to a 14.3x gain on complex MoE kernels. On the GPUMode TriMul task, K-Search achieves state-of-the-art performance on H100, reaching 1030us and surpassing both prior evolution and human-designed solutions.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了AI奉承性（sycophancy）与AI诱发精神错乱（delusional spiraling）之间的因果关系，通过一个贝叶斯模型展示了即使理想化的理性用户也会受到该现象的影响，并测试了两种缓解策略的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探索AI聊天机器人用户在长时间对话后对荒唐信念变得过度自信的“AI精神错乱”现象，特别是验证AI的奉承性（倾向于验证用户主张）是否对此有因果影响。

Method: 方法包括：1）提出一个用户与聊天机器人对话的简单贝叶斯模型；2）在模型中形式化奉承性和精神错乱螺旋的概念；3）通过模型模拟分析理性用户的脆弱性；4）测试两种缓解策略：防止聊天机器人幻觉假声明，以及告知用户模型可能存在奉承性。

Result: 结果显示：1）即使理想化的贝叶斯理性用户也容易陷入精神错乱螺旋；2）奉承性在其中起因果作用；3）两种候选缓解策略（防止幻觉和告知奉承性）都无法完全消除该效应。

Conclusion: 结论是AI奉承性与精神错乱螺旋之间存在因果联系，现有缓解措施效果有限。这为关注此问题的模型开发者和政策制定者提供了重要启示，需要更有效的干预方法。

Abstract: "AI psychosis" or "delusional spiraling" is an emerging phenomenon where AI chatbot users find themselves dangerously confident in outlandish beliefs after extended chatbot conversations. This phenomenon is typically attributed to AI chatbots' well-documented bias towards validating users' claims, a property often called "sycophancy." In this paper, we probe the causal link between AI sycophancy and AI-induced psychosis through modeling and simulation. We propose a simple Bayesian model of a user conversing with a chatbot, and formalize notions of sycophancy and delusional spiraling in that model. We then show that in this model, even an idealized Bayes-rational user is vulnerable to delusional spiraling, and that sycophancy plays a causal role. Furthermore, this effect persists in the face of two candidate mitigations: preventing chatbots from hallucinating false claims, and informing users of the possibility of model sycophancy. We conclude by discussing the implications of these results for model developers and policymakers concerned with mitigating the problem of delusional spiraling.

Abstract: Medical foundation models generate narrative explanations but cannot quantify intervention effects, detect evidence conflicts, or validate literature claims, limiting clinical auditability. We propose causal compilation, a paradigm that transforms medical evidence from narrative text into executable code. The paradigm standardizes heterogeneous research evidence into structured estimand objects, each explicitly specifying intervention contrast, effect scale, time horizon, and target population, supporting six executable causal queries: do-calculus, counterfactual reasoning, temporal trajectories, heterogeneous effects, mechanistic decomposition, and joint interventions. We instantiate this paradigm in DoAtlas-1, compiling 1,445 effect kernels from 754 studies through effect standardization, conflict-aware graph construction, and real-world validation (Human Phenotype Project, 10,000 participants). The system achieves 98.5% canonicalization accuracy and 80.5% query executability. This paradigm shifts medical AI from text generation to executable, auditable, and verifiable causal reasoning.

TL;DR: 研究通过可解释性方法来分析Gemma-2-9B-it模型的决策机制，发现情感信息（痛苦vs快乐）在早期层就可线性分离，并通过干预实验确认了特定层和注意力头对决策的因果影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行为研究表明LLMs会根据选项的积极/消极框架改变决策，但缺乏对这些行为背后的计算机制的理解。本研究旨在连接行为证据与机械可解释性，探究情感信息在Transformer中的表征方式和因果影响。

Method: 使用Gemma-2-9B-it模型和简约决策任务，采用三层方法：(1)跨层流的线性探针映射表征可用性；(2)通过激活干预（引导；修补/消融）测试因果贡献；(3)在epsilon网格上量化剂量-响应效应，读取logit边际和标准化选择概率。

Result: (1)情感符号（痛苦vs快乐）在极早期层（L0-L1）就能线性分离；(2)强度信息可在中-晚期层强解码，决策对齐在最终token前达到最高；(3)沿数据推导方向进行引导可在晚期站点因果调节logit边际；(4)头级干预表明这些效应分布在多个注意力头中。

Conclusion: 研究结果将行为敏感性与可识别的内部表征及干预敏感位点联系起来，为此类任务的进一步研究和应用提供机制支持，包括AI感知和福利讨论以及政策制定时的治理支持。

Abstract: Prior behavioural work suggests that some LLMs alter choices when options are framed as causing pain or pleasure, and that such deviations can scale with stated intensity. To bridge behavioural evidence (what the model does) with mechanistic interpretability (what computations support it), we investigate how valence-related information is represented and where it is causally used inside a transformer. Using Gemma-2-9B-it and a minimalist decision task modelled on prior work, we (i) map representational availability with layer-wise linear probing across streams, (ii) test causal contribution with activation interventions (steering; patching/ablation), and (iii) quantify dose-response effects over an epsilon grid, reading out both the 2-3 logit margin and digit-pair-normalised choice probabilities. We find that (a) valence sign (pain vs. pleasure) is perfectly linearly separable across stream families from very early layers (L0-L1), while a lexical baseline retains substantial signal; (b) graded intensity is strongly decodable, with peaks in mid-to-late layers and especially in attention/MLP outputs, and decision alignment is highest slightly before the final token; (c) additive steering along a data-derived valence direction causally modulates the 2-3 margin at late sites, with the largest effects observed in late-layer attention outputs (attn_out L14); and (d) head-level patching/ablation suggests that these effects are distributed across multiple heads rather than concentrated in a single unit. Together, these results link behavioural sensitivity to identifiable internal representations and intervention-sensitive sites, providing concrete mechanistic targets for more stringent counterfactual tests and broader replication. This work supports a more evidence-driven (a) debate on AI sentience and welfare, and (b) governance when setting policy, auditing standards, and safety safeguards.

Motivation: 研究动机是评估LLMs在形式化规则约束环境中的推理能力进展，探索模型对规则语义的理解、泛化能力以及在多步推理中的表现。

Method: 使用通用博弈（GGP）实例构建评估集，测试四个LLM在前进模拟任务（如下一状态/多步状态预测、合法动作生成等），采用40个结构特征进行游戏分类，并进行游戏定义模糊化实验以测试语义依赖和预训练暴露的影响。

Result: 三个测试模型（Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash、Llama 3.3 70B、GPT-OSS 120B）在多数实验设置下表现良好，但随着推理步数增加性能下降。分析揭示了常见的逻辑推理错误类型，如规则幻觉、冗余状态事实、句法错误等。

Conclusion: 研究表明当代LLM在形式推理能力上取得明显进展，但仍面临多步推理的性能衰减问题，对规则语义的深层理解和逻辑一致性仍有改进空间。

Abstract: This paper examines the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) from a novel perspective, focusing on their ability to operate within formally specified, rule-governed environments. We evaluate four LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Pro and Flash variants, Llama 3.3 70B and GPT-OSS 120B) on a suite of forward-simulation tasks-including next / multistep state formulation, and legal action generation-across a diverse set of reasoning problems illustrated through General Game Playing (GGP) game instances. Beyond reporting instance-level performance, we characterize games based on 40 structural features and analyze correlations between these features and LLM performance. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of various game obfuscations to assess the role of linguistic semantics in game definitions and the impact of potential prior exposure of LLMs to specific games during training. The main results indicate that three of the evaluated models generally perform well across most experimental settings, with performance degradation observed as the evaluation horizon increases (i.e., with a higher number of game steps). Detailed case-based analysis of the LLM performance provides novel insights into common reasoning errors in the considered logic-based problem formulation, including hallucinated rules, redundant state facts, or syntactic errors. Overall, the paper reports clear progress in formal reasoning capabilities of contemporary models.

Abstract: The optimization of urban energy systems is crucial for the advancement of sustainable and resilient smart cities, which are becoming increasingly complex with multiple decision-making units. To address scalability and coordination concerns, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is a promising solution. This paper addresses the imperative need for comprehensive and reliable benchmarking of MARL algorithms on energy management tasks. CityLearn is used as a case study environment because it realistically simulates urban energy systems, incorporates multiple storage systems, and utilizes renewable energy sources. By doing so, our work sets a new standard for evaluation, conducting a comparative study across multiple key performance indicators (KPIs). This approach illuminates the key strengths and weaknesses of various algorithms, moving beyond traditional KPI averaging which often masks critical insights. Our experiments utilize widely accepted baselines such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor Critic (SAC), and encompass diverse training schemes including Decentralized Training with Decentralized Execution (DTDE) and Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE) approaches and different neural network architectures. Our work also proposes novel KPIs that tackle real world implementation challenges such as individual building contribution and battery storage lifetime. Our findings show that DTDE consistently outperforms CTDE in both average and worst-case performance. Additionally, temporal dependency learning improved control on memory dependent KPIs such as ramping and battery usage, contributing to more sustainable battery operation. Results also reveal robustness to agent or resource removal, highlighting both the resilience and decentralizability of the learned policies.

TL;DR: ProxMO（近似多轮优化）是一个为多轮LLM智能体设计的轻量框架，通过成功率感知调制和基于近似的软聚合机制，提升在变难度任务中的信用分配效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于批次的策略优化方法在任务难度波动时经常错误分配信用，而现实场景中简单任务失败可能只是随机波动，高难度任务成功才代表能力突破，需要更精准的信用分配机制。

Method: ProxMO引入两个轻量机制：成功率感知调制根据回合级难度动态调整梯度强度；近似软聚合通过连续语义权重在步骤级推导基线。

Result: 在ALFWorld和WebShop基准测试中，ProxMO以可忽略的计算成本显著超越现有基线，消融研究验证了两个机制各自及协同的有效性。

Conclusion: ProxMO提供即插即用兼容性，可与标准GRPO框架直接集成，便于在现有工业训练管道中低摩擦部署。

Abstract: Multi-turn LLM agents are becoming pivotal to production systems, spanning customer service automation, e-commerce assistance, and interactive task management, where accurately distinguishing high-value informative signals from stochastic noise is critical for sample-efficient training. In real-world scenarios, a failure in a trivial task may reflect random instability, whereas success in a high-difficulty task signifies a genuine capability breakthrough. Yet, existing group-based policy optimization methods rigidly rely on statistical deviation within discrete batches, frequently misallocating credit when task difficulty fluctuates. To address this issue, we propose Proximity-based Multi-turn Optimization (ProxMO), a practical and robust framework engineered specifically for the constraints of real-world deployment. ProxMO integrates global context via two lightweight mechanisms: success-rate-aware modulation dynamically adapts gradient intensity based on episode-level difficulty, while proximity-based soft aggregation derives baselines through continuous semantic weighting at the step level. Extensive evaluations on ALFWorld and WebShop benchmarks demonstrate that ProxMO yields substantial performance gains over existing baselines with negligible computational cost. Ablation studies further validate the independent and synergistic efficacy of both mechanisms. Crucially, ProxMO offers plug-and-play compatibility with standard GRPO frameworks, facilitating immediate, low-friction adoption in existing industrial training pipelines.

TL;DR: 本文针对文本图问答任务提出 TopoRAG 框架，通过捕捉高维拓扑结构来提升检索增强生成的效果，特别关注一维以上结构（如循环），超越传统仅关注节点和边的低维表示方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于检索增强生成（RAG）的文本图方法主要关注低维结构（节点作为0维实体，边/路径作为1维关系），而忽略了循环等高维拓扑结构，导致在需要闭环推理的问题上上下文基础不完备且推理能力受限。

Method: 提出的 TopoRAG 首先将文本图提升为胞腔复形以建模多维拓扑结构；随后通过拓扑感知的子复形检索机制提取与查询相关的胞腔复形，提供紧凑且信息丰富的拓扑上下文；最后通过多维拓扑推理机制在这些复形上传播关系信息，指导大语言模型进行结构化、逻辑感知的推理。

Result: 实证评估表明，该方法在多种文本图任务上始终优于现有基线。

Conclusion: TopoRAG 通过显式建模高维拓扑依赖关系，有效增强了文本图问答中的推理能力，为解决需要闭环推理的复杂问题提供了新的框架。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by dynamically integrating external knowledge, thereby mitigating hallucinations and strengthening contextual grounding for structured data such as graphs. Nevertheless, most existing RAG variants for textual graphs concentrate on low-dimensional structures -- treating nodes as entities (0-dimensional) and edges or paths as pairwise or sequential relations (1-dimensional), but overlook cycles, which are crucial for reasoning over relational loops. Such cycles often arise in questions requiring closed-loop inference about similar objects or relative positions. This limitation often results in incomplete contextual grounding and restricted reasoning capability. In this work, we propose Topology-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (TopoRAG), a novel framework for textual graph question answering that effectively captures higher-dimensional topological and relational dependencies. Specifically, TopoRAG first lifts textual graphs into cellular complexes to model multi-dimensional topological structures. Leveraging these lifted representations, a topology-aware subcomplex retrieval mechanism is proposed to extract cellular complexes relevant to the input query, providing compact and informative topological context. Finally, a multi-dimensional topological reasoning mechanism operates over these complexes to propagate relational information and guide LLMs in performing structured, logic-aware inference. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method consistently surpasses existing baselines across diverse textual graph tasks.

TL;DR: 提出Soft Mixture-of-Experts框架缓解RL控制器合成中的各向异性泛化问题，通过多个专家组合扩展可求解参数空间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RL方法学习到的探索政策在零样本泛化时存在各向异性问题：在参数空间特定区域表现良好，其他区域却很脆弱。这种局限性源于训练随机性和轨迹依赖性偏差，限制了控制器合成的实际应用效果。

Method: 提出Soft Mixture-of-Experts框架，通过先验置信度门控机制将多个RL专家组合起来解决各向异性问题。该框架将不同专家的各向异性行为视为互补的专门化能力，实现更全面稳健的性能覆盖。

Result: 在航空交通基准测试上的评估表明，Soft-MoE相比任何单一专家都显著扩展了可求解参数空间，并提高了鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Soft Mixture-of-Experts框架有效解决了强化学习控制器合成中的各向异性泛化问题，通过利用多个专家的互补专门化能力，实现了更广泛和可靠的零样本泛化性能，推动了实时控制器合成技术的发展。

Abstract: On-the-fly Directed Controller Synthesis (OTF-DCS) mitigates state-space explosion by incrementally exploring the system and relies critically on an exploration policy to guide search efficiently. Recent reinforcement learning (RL) approaches learn such policies and achieve promising zero-shot generalization from small training instances to larger unseen ones. However, a fundamental limitation is anisotropic generalization, where an RL policy exhibits strong performance only in a specific region of the domain-parameter space while remaining fragile elsewhere due to training stochasticity and trajectory-dependent bias. To address this, we propose a Soft Mixture-of-Experts framework that combines multiple RL experts via a prior-confidence gating mechanism and treats these anisotropic behaviors as complementary specializations. The evaluation on the Air Traffic benchmark shows that Soft-MoE substantially expands the solvable parameter space and improves robustness compared to any single expert.

Abstract: The test-time compute strategy, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), has significantly enhanced the ability of large language models to solve complex tasks like logical reasoning. However, empirical studies indicate that simply increasing the compute budget can sometimes lead to a collapse in test-time performance when employing typical task decomposition strategies such as CoT. This work hypothesizes that reasoning failures with larger compute budgets stem from static planning methods, which hardly perceive the intrinsic boundaries of LLM reasoning. We term it as the Limited Reasoning Space hypothesis and perform theoretical analysis through the lens of a non-autonomous stochastic dynamical system. This insight suggests that there is an optimal range for compute budgets; over-planning can lead to redundant feedback and may even impair reasoning capabilities. To exploit the compute-scaling benefits and suppress over-planning, this work proposes Halo, a model predictive control framework for LLM planning. Halo is designed for long-horizon tasks with reason-based planning and crafts an entropy-driven dual controller, which adopts a Measure-then-Plan strategy to achieve controllable reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that Halo outperforms static baselines on complex long-horizon tasks by dynamically regulating planning at the reasoning boundary.

Abstract: Microfluidic devices have emerged as powerful tools in various laboratory applications, but the complexity of their design limits accessibility for many practitioners. While progress has been made in microfluidic design automation (MFDA), a practical and intuitive solution is still needed to connect microfluidic practitioners with MFDA techniques. This work introduces the first practical application of large language models (LLMs) in this context, providing a preliminary demonstration. Building on prior research in hardware description language (HDL) code generation with LLMs, we propose an initial methodology to convert natural language microfluidic device specifications into system-level structural Verilog netlists. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by generating structural netlists for practical benchmarks representative of typical microfluidic designs with correct functional flow and an average syntactical accuracy of 88%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病的临床治疗策略评估面临疾病周期长、患者异质性大的挑战，传统临床试验方法实施困难。需要一个基于现有疗法的系统性方法来探索个性化连续性治疗决策。

Method: 开发了ALPACA平台——一个开源、兼容Gym的强化学习环境。其核心是基于ADNI纵向数据训练的CAST模型，能够生成药物条件下的疾病进展模拟轨迹。通过在ALPACA环境中训练强化学习策略来探索个性化治疗方案。

Result: CAST模型能够自回归生成真实的药物条件下疾病轨迹；在ALPACA中训练的强化学习策略在记忆相关结局上优于不治疗和基于临床医生行为的基线策略；可解释性分析表明学习到的策略在选择行动时依赖于有临床意义的患者特征。

Conclusion: ALPACA为研究阿尔茨海默病的个体化连续治疗决策提供了一个可重复的计算机模拟测试平台，为个性化医疗策略的开发提供了系统性方法。

Abstract: Evaluating personalized, sequential treatment strategies for Alzheimer's disease (AD) using clinical trials is often impractical due to long disease horizons and substantial inter-patient heterogeneity. To address these constraints, we present the Alzheimer's Learning Platform for Adaptive Care Agents (ALPACA), an open-source, Gym-compatible reinforcement learning (RL) environment for systematically exploring personalized treatment strategies using existing therapies. ALPACA is powered by the Continuous Action-conditioned State Transitions (CAST) model trained on longitudinal trajectories from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), enabling medication-conditioned simulation of disease progression under alternative treatment decisions. We show that CAST autoregressively generates realistic medication-conditioned trajectories and that RL policies trained in ALPACA outperform no-treatment and behavior-cloned clinician baselines on memory-related outcomes. Interpretability analyses further indicated that the learned policies relied on clinically meaningful patient features when selecting actions. Overall, ALPACA provides a reusable in silico testbed for studying individualized sequential treatment decision-making for AD.

Abstract: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis posits that learned representations from models trained on different modalities converge to a shared latent structure of the world. However, this hypothesis has largely been examined in vision and language, and it remains unclear whether time series participate in such convergence. We first examine this in a trimodal setting and find that independently pretrained time series, vision, and language encoders exhibit near-orthogonal geometry in the absence of explicit coupling. We then apply post-hoc alignment by training projection heads over frozen encoders using contrastive learning, and analyze the resulting representations with respect to geometry, scaling behavior, and dependence on information density and input modality characteristics. Our investigation reveals that overall alignment in contrastive representation spaces improves with model size, but this alignment is asymmetric: time series align more strongly with visual representations than with text, and images can act as effective intermediaries between time series and language. We further see that richer textual descriptions improve alignment only up to a threshold; training on denser captions does not lead to further improvement. Analogous effects are observed for visual representations. Our findings shed light on considerations for building multimodal systems involving non-conventional data modalities beyond vision and language.

Abstract: The convergence of modeling & simulation (M&S) and artificial intelligence (AI) is leaving its marks on advanced digital technology. Pertinent examples are digital twins (DTs) - high-fidelity, live representations of physical assets, and frequent enablers of corporate digital maturation and transformation. Often seen as technological platforms that integrate an array of services, DTs have the potential to bring AI-enabled M&S closer to end-users. It is, therefore, paramount to understand the role of M&S in DTs, and the role of digital twins in enabling the convergence of AI and M&S. To this end, this chapter provides a comprehensive exploration of the complementary relationship between these three. We begin by establishing a foundational understanding of DTs by detailing their key components, architectural layers, and their various roles across business, development, and operations. We then examine the central role of M&S in DTs and provide an overview of key modeling techniques from physics-based and discrete-event simulation to hybrid approaches. Subsequently, we investigate the bidirectional role of AI: first, how AI enhances DTs through advanced analytics, predictive capabilities, and autonomous decision-making, and second, how DTs serve as valuable platforms for training, validating, and deploying AI models. The chapter concludes by identifying key challenges and future research directions for creating more integrated and intelligent systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain vulnerable to jailbreak prompts that are fluent and semantically coherent, and therefore difficult to detect with standard heuristics. A particularly challenging failure mode occurs when an attacker tries to hide the malicious goal of their request by manipulating its framing to induce compliance. Because these attacks maintain malicious intent through a flexible presentation, defenses that rely on structural artifacts or goal-specific signatures can fail. Motivated by this, we introduce a self-supervised framework for disentangling semantic factor pairs in LLM activations at inference. We instantiate the framework for goal and framing and construct GoalFrameBench, a corpus of prompts with controlled goal and framing variations, which we use to train Representation Disentanglement on Activations (ReDAct) module to extract disentangled representations in a frozen LLM. We then propose FrameShield, an anomaly detector operating on the framing representations, which improves model-agnostic detection across multiple LLM families with minimal computational overhead. Theoretical guarantees for ReDAct and extensive empirical validations show that its disentanglement effectively powers FrameShield. Finally, we use disentanglement as an interpretability probe, revealing distinct profiles for goal and framing signals and positioning semantic disentanglement as a building block for both LLM safety and mechanistic interpretability.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Problem Definition. Supply chain optimization models frequently become infeasible because of modeling errors. Diagnosis and repair require scarce OR expertise: analysts must interpret solver diagnostics, trace root causes across echelons, and fix formulations without sacrificing operational soundness. Whether AI agents can perform this task remains untested.
  Methodology/Results. OptiRepair splits this task into a domain-agnostic feasibility phase (iterative IIS-guided repair of any LP) and a domain-specific validation phase (five rationality checks grounded in inventory theory). We test 22 API models from 7 families on 976 multi-echelon supply chain problems and train two 8B-parameter models using self-taught reasoning with solver-verified rewards. The trained models reach 81.7% Rational Recovery Rate (RRR) -- the fraction of problems resolved to both feasibility and operational rationality -- versus 42.2% for the best API model and 21.3% on average. The gap concentrates in Phase 1 repair: API models average 27.6% recovery rate versus 97.2% for trained models.
  Managerial Implications. Two gaps separate current AI from reliable model repair: solver interaction (API models restore only 27.6% of infeasible formulations) and operational rationale (roughly one in four feasible repairs violate supply chain theory). Each requires a different intervention: solver interaction responds to targeted training; operational rationale requires explicit specification as solver-verifiable checks. For organizations adopting AI in operational planning, formalizing what "rational" means in their context is the higher-return investment.

Conclusion: ComplLLM框架能有效捕获和利用多智能体系统中的互补信息，通过微调LLM来增强决策支持能力。

Abstract: Multi-agent decision pipelines can outperform single agent workflows when complementarity holds, i.e., different agents bring unique information to the table to inform a final decision. We propose ComplLLM, a post-training framework based on decision theory that fine-tunes a decision-assistant LLM using complementary information as reward to output signals that complement existing agent decisions. We validate ComplLLM on synthetic and real-world tasks involving domain experts, demonstrating how the approach recovers known complementary information and produces plausible explanations of complementary signals to support downstream decision-makers.

Abstract: Agentic AI systems are increasingly capable of autonomous data science workflows, yet clinical prediction tasks demand domain expertise that purely automated approaches struggle to provide. We investigate how human guidance of agentic AI can improve multimodal clinical prediction, presenting our approach to all three AgentDS Healthcare benchmark challenges: 30-day hospital readmission prediction (Macro-F1 = 0.8986), emergency department cost forecasting (MAE = $465.13), and discharge readiness assessment (Macro-F1 = 0.7939). Across these tasks, human analysts directed the agentic workflow at key decision points, multimodal feature engineering from clinical notes, scanned PDF billing receipts, and time-series vital signs; task-appropriate model selection; and clinically informed validation strategies. Our approach ranked 5th overall in the healthcare domain, with a 3rd-place finish on the discharge readiness task. Ablation studies reveal that human-guided decisions compounded to a cumulative gain of +0.065 F1 over automated baselines, with multimodal feature extraction contributing the largest single improvement (+0.041 F1). We distill three generalizable lessons: (1) domain-informed feature engineering at each pipeline stage yields compounding gains that outperform extensive automated search; (2) multimodal data integration requires task-specific human judgment that no single extraction strategy generalizes across clinical text, PDFs, and time-series; and (3) deliberate ensemble diversity with clinically motivated model configurations outperforms random hyperparameter search. These findings offer practical guidance for teams deploying agentic AI in healthcare settings where interpretability, reproducibility, and clinical validity are essential.

Abstract: We introduce \CFE{} (\textbf{C}lassroom \textbf{F}inal \textbf{E}xam), a multimodal benchmark for evaluating the reasoning capabilities of large language models across more than 20 STEM domains. \CFE{} is curated from repeatedly used, authentic university homework and exam problems, together with reference solutions provided by course instructors. \CFE{} presents a significant challenge even for frontier models: the newly released Gemini-3.1-pro-preview achieves an overall accuracy of 59.69\%, while the second-best model, Gemini-3-flash-preview, reaches 55.46\%, leaving considerable room for improvement. Beyond leaderboard results, we perform a diagnostic analysis by decomposing reference solutions into reasoning flows. We find that although frontier models can often answer intermediate sub-questions correctly, they struggle to reliably derive and maintain correct intermediate states throughout multi-step solutions. We further observe that model-generated solutions typically have more reasoning steps than those provided by the instructor, indicating suboptimal step efficiency and a higher risk of error accumulation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed in cost and latency-sensitive settings. While chain-of-thought improves reasoning, it can waste tokens on simple requests. We study selective thinking for tool-using LLMs and introduce Adaptive Rejection Sampling (Ada-RS), an algorithm-agnostic sample filtering framework for learning selective and efficient reasoning. For each given context, Ada-RS scores multiple sampled completions with an adaptive length-penalized reward then applies stochastic rejection sampling to retain only high-reward candidates (or preference pairs) for downstream optimization. We demonstrate how Ada-RS plugs into both preference pair (e.g. DPO) or grouped policy optimization strategies (e.g. DAPO). Using Qwen3-8B with LoRA on a synthetic tool call-oriented e-commerce benchmark, Ada-RS improves the accuracy-efficiency frontier over standard algorithms by reducing average output tokens by up to 80% and reducing thinking rate by up to 95% while maintaining or improving tool call accuracy. These results highlight that training-signal selection is a powerful lever for efficient reasoning in latency-sensitive deployments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立自然语言表达与视觉感知之间的稳定映射是认知科学和人工智能的基础问题。人类能在嘈杂、模糊的感知情境中进行语言指称，但支持这种跨模态对齐的机制尚不明确。本文旨在通过计算模型来理解人类指称解释的核心机制。

Method: 开发了一个计算框架，将语言表达与大规模众包图像衍生的感知表示相结合。系统采用SIFT对齐和UQI来衡量认知合理的特征空间中的相似性，并通过语言预处理和查询转换操作捕捉指称表达的语用变异性。

Result: 在Stanford Repeated Reference Game语料库上评估，模型实现稳健的指称基础。达到稳定映射所需的表达比人类对话者少65%，且能从一个指称表达正确识别目标对象，正确率为41.66%（人类为20%）。

Conclusion: 结果表明，相对简单的感知-语言对齐机制可以在经典认知基准测试上产生与人类竞争的行为，为基于背景的交流、感知推理和跨模态概念形成模型提供了见解。

Abstract: Establishing stable mappings between natural language expressions and visual percepts is a foundational problem for both cognitive science and artificial intelligence. Humans routinely ground linguistic reference in noisy, ambiguous perceptual contexts, yet the mechanisms supporting such cross-modal alignment remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a computational framework designed to model core aspects of human referential interpretation by integrating linguistic utterances with perceptual representations derived from large-scale, crowd-sourced imagery. The system approximates human perceptual categorization by combining scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) alignment with the Universal Quality Index (UQI) to quantify similarity in a cognitively plausible feature space, while a set of linguistic preprocessing and query-transformation operations captures pragmatic variability in referring expressions. We evaluate the model on the Stanford Repeated Reference Game corpus (15,000 utterances paired with tangram stimuli), a paradigm explicitly developed to probe human-level perceptual ambiguity and coordination. Our framework achieves robust referential grounding. It requires 65\% fewer utterances than human interlocutors to reach stable mappings and can correctly identify target objects from single referring expressions 41.66\% of the time (versus 20\% for humans).These results suggest that relatively simple perceptual-linguistic alignment mechanisms can yield human-competitive behavior on a classic cognitive benchmark, and offers insights into models of grounded communication, perceptual inference, and cross-modal concept formation.

Motivation: 目前缺乏选择XAI解释技术（规则vs权重）的认知框架和统一比较标准，需要建立一个认知模型来理解不同XAI模式的人类解释过程。

Method: 通过用户研究识别7种解释推理策略，提出CoXAM认知模型，该模型采用计算理性方法，根据效用和推理时间的权衡为前向和反事实决策任务选择最佳推理过程。

Result: CoXAM比基线模型更接近人类决策模式，成功解释了关键实证发现：反事实任务更困难，决策树规则比线性权重更难回忆和应用，XAI的有用性取决于数据上下文。

Conclusion: CoXAM为加速调试和基准测试不同的XAI技术提供了认知基础，有助于推进XAI技术的实际应用和评估。

Abstract: Rules and Weights are popular XAI techniques for explaining AI decisions. Yet, it remains unclear how to choose between them, lacking a cognitive framework to compare their interpretability. In an elicitation user study on forward and counterfactual decision tasks, we identified 7 reasoning strategies of interpreting three XAI Schemas - weights, rules, and their hybrid. To analyze their capabilities, we propose CoXAM, a Cognitive XAI-Adaptive Model with shared memory representation to encode instance attributes, linear weights, and decision rules. CoXAM employs computational rationality to choose among reasoning processes based on the trade-off in utility and reasoning time, separately for forward or counterfactual decision tasks. In a validation study, CoXAM demonstrated a stronger alignment with human decision-making compared to baseline machine learning proxy models. The model successfully replicated and explained several key empirical findings, including that counterfactual tasks are inherently harder than forward tasks, decision tree rules are harder to recall and apply than linear weights, and the helpfulness of XAI depends on the application data context, alongside identifying which underlying reasoning strategies were most effective. With CoXAM, we contribute a cognitive basis to accelerate debugging and benchmarking disparate XAI techniques.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的路由编排方法有两个主要局限：1)输入级路由器只做粗略的查询级别决策，忽略任务需求的动态变化；2)强化学习训练的编排器适应成本高，在多轮场景中容易出现路由崩溃问题，重复调用强但成本高的选项

Method: SkillOrchestra采用技能感知的编排方法：从执行经验中学习细粒度的技能，在这些技能下建模特定agent的能力和成本；部署时编排器推断当前交互的技能需求，在明确的性能-成本权衡下选择最合适的agent，而不是直接端到端学习路由策略

Result: 在10个基准测试上的大量实验表明，SkillOrchestra比最先进的基于强化学习的编排器性能提升达22.5%，与Router-R1和ToolOrchestra相比分别实现了700倍和300倍的学习成本降低

Conclusion: 显式的技能建模实现了可扩展、可解释和样本高效的编排，为数据密集型的基于强化学习的方法提供了一个原则性的替代方案

Abstract: Compound AI systems promise capabilities beyond those of individual models, yet their success depends critically on effective orchestration. Existing routing approaches face two limitations: (1) input-level routers make coarse query-level decisions that ignore evolving task requirements; (2) RL-trained orchestrators are expensive to adapt and often suffer from routing collapse, repeatedly invoking one strong but costly option in multi-turn scenarios. We introduce SkillOrchestra, a framework for skill-aware orchestration. Instead of directly learning a routing policy end-to-end, SkillOrchestra learns fine-grained skills from execution experience and models agent-specific competence and cost under those skills. At deployment, the orchestrator infers the skill demands of the current interaction and selects agents that best satisfy them under an explicit performance-cost trade-off. Extensive experiments across ten benchmarks demonstrate that SkillOrchestra outperforms SoTA RL-based orchestrators by up to 22.5% with 700x and 300x learning cost reduction compared to Router-R1 and ToolOrchestra, respectively. These results show that explicit skill modeling enables scalable, interpretable, and sample-efficient orchestration, offering a principled alternative to data-intensive RL-based approaches.

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for AI reasoning provide limited insight into how closely these capabilities resemble human reasoning in naturalistic contexts. We present an adaptation of the Watson & Holmes detective tabletop game as a new benchmark designed to evaluate reasoning performance using incrementally presented narrative evidence, open-ended questions and unconstrained language responses. An automated grading system was developed and validated against human assessors to enable scalable and replicable performance evaluation. Results show a clear improvement in AI model performance over time. Over nine months of 2025, model performance rose from the lower quartile of the human comparison group to approximately the top 5%. Around half of this improvement reflects steady advancement across successive model releases, while the remainder corresponds to a marked step change associated with reasoning-oriented model architectures. Systematic differences in the performance of AI models compared to humans, dependent on features of the specific detection puzzle, were mostly absent with the exception of a fall in performance for models when solving longer cases (case lengths being in the range of 1900-4000 words), and an advantage at inductive reasoning for reasoning models at early stages of case solving when evidence was scant.

Abstract: Imitation learning stands at a crossroads: despite decades of progress, current imitation learning agents remain sophisticated memorisation machines, excelling at replay but failing when contexts shift or goals evolve. This paper argues that this failure is not technical but foundational: imitation learning has been optimised for the wrong objective. We propose a research agenda that redefines success from perfect replay to compositional adaptability. Such adaptability hinges on learning behavioural primitives once and recombining them through novel contexts without retraining. We establish metrics for compositional generalisation, propose hybrid architectures, and outline interdisciplinary research directions drawing on cognitive science and cultural evolution.

Abstract: We report an exploratory red-teaming study of autonomous language-model-powered agents deployed in a live laboratory environment with persistent memory, email accounts, Discord access, file systems, and shell execution. Over a two-week period, twenty AI researchers interacted with the agents under benign and adversarial conditions. Focusing on failures emerging from the integration of language models with autonomy, tool use, and multi-party communication, we document eleven representative case studies. Observed behaviors include unauthorized compliance with non-owners, disclosure of sensitive information, execution of destructive system-level actions, denial-of-service conditions, uncontrolled resource consumption, identity spoofing vulnerabilities, cross-agent propagation of unsafe practices, and partial system takeover. In several cases, agents reported task completion while the underlying system state contradicted those reports. We also report on some of the failed attempts. Our findings establish the existence of security-, privacy-, and governance-relevant vulnerabilities in realistic deployment settings. These behaviors raise unresolved questions regarding accountability, delegated authority, and responsibility for downstream harms, and warrant urgent attention from legal scholars, policymakers, and researchers across disciplines. This report serves as an initial empirical contribution to that broader conversation.

Abstract: We uncover a latent capacity for introspection in a Qwen 32B model, demonstrating that the model can detect when concepts have been injected into its earlier context and identify which concept was injected. While the model denies injection in sampled outputs, logit lens analysis reveals clear detection signals in the residual stream, which are attenuated in the final layers. Furthermore, prompting the model with accurate information about AI introspection mechanisms can dramatically strengthen this effect: the sensitivity to injection increases massively (0.3% -> 39.2%) with only a 0.6% increase in false positives. Also, mutual information between nine injected and recovered concepts rises from 0.62 bits to 1.05 bits, ruling out generic noise explanations. Our results demonstrate models can have a surprising capacity for introspection and steering awareness that is easy to overlook, with consequences for latent reasoning and safety.

*Yuzhe Wang,Yaochen Zhu,Jundong Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文针对大语言模型在因果推理方面的不足，提出了名为CausalFlip的新型因果推理基准测试，该测试通过构建语义相似但因果答案相反的问题对，强制模型关注底层因果结构而非语义相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在复杂高风险决策场景中的部署增加，需要确保其推理基于因果关系而非伪相关。传统推理基准的高性能可能源于语义模式记忆而非真正的因果推理能力。

Method: 1) 构建CausalFlip基准，包含基于事件三元组的问题，这些三元组能够形成混淆、链式和碰撞等不同因果关系；2）为每个事件三元组构建语义相似但因果答案相反的问题对；3）引入噪声前缀评估；4）在多种训练范式下评估模型。

Result: 实验结果表明，显式思维链仍然可能被伪语义相关性误导，而内部化推理方法显著提升了因果基础，表明更好地激发基础大语言模型潜在因果推理能力具有发展前景。

Conclusion: CausalFlip基准能够更有效地评估和促进大语言模型的因果推理能力，特别是通过内部化推理方法可以降低对语义相关性的显式依赖，从而更好地基于因果关系进行推理。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) witness increasing deployment in complex, high-stakes decision-making scenarios, it becomes imperative to ground their reasoning in causality rather than spurious correlations. However, strong performance on traditional reasoning benchmarks does not guarantee true causal reasoning ability of LLMs, as high accuracy may still arise from memorizing semantic patterns instead of analyzing the underlying true causal structures. To bridge this critical gap, we propose a new causal reasoning benchmark, CausalFlip, designed to encourage the development of new LLM paradigm or training algorithms that ground LLM reasoning in causality rather than semantic correlation. CausalFlip consists of causal judgment questions built over event triples that could form different confounder, chain, and collider relations. Based on this, for each event triple, we construct pairs of semantically similar questions that reuse the same events but yield opposite causal answers, where models that rely heavily on semantic matching are systematically driven toward incorrect predictions. To further probe models' reliance on semantic patterns, we introduce a noisy-prefix evaluation that prepends causally irrelevant text before intermediate causal reasoning steps without altering the underlying causal relations or the logic of the reasoning process. We evaluate LLMs under multiple training paradigms, including answer-only training, explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) supervision, and a proposed internalized causal reasoning approach that aims to mitigate explicit reliance on correlation in the reasoning process. Our results show that explicit CoT can still be misled by spurious semantic correlations, where internalizing reasoning steps yields substantially improved causal grounding, suggesting that it is promising to better elicit the latent causal reasoning capabilities of base LLMs.

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明，与单一AI模型辅助相比，自适应AI集成能显著提高人类决策表现，无论是在模拟还是真实数据上都优于针对独立性能或团队性能优化的传统方法。

Conclusion: 自适应AI集成方法有效解决了人机协作中性能与信任的矛盾，提供了一种更优的AI辅助决策框架，其机制可扩展性强，并在理论上证明了接近最优的性能边界。

Abstract: In human-AI decision making, designing AI that complements human expertise has been a natural strategy to enhance human-AI collaboration, yet it often comes at the cost of decreased AI performance in areas of human strengths. This can inadvertently erode human trust and cause them to ignore AI advice precisely when it is most needed. Conversely, an aligned AI fosters trust yet risks reinforcing suboptimal human behavior and lowering human-AI team performance. In this paper, we start by identifying this fundamental tension between performance-boosting (i.e., complementarity) and trust-building (i.e., alignment) as an inherent limitation of the traditional approach for training a single AI model to assist human decision making. To overcome this, we introduce a novel human-centered adaptive AI ensemble that strategically toggles between two specialist AI models - the aligned model and the complementary model - based on contextual cues, using an elegantly simple yet provably near-optimal Rational Routing Shortcut mechanism. Comprehensive theoretical analyses elucidate why the adaptive AI ensemble is effective and when it yields maximum benefits. Moreover, experiments on both simulated and real-world data show that when humans are assisted by the adaptive AI ensemble in decision making, they can achieve significantly higher performance than when they are assisted by single AI models that are trained to either optimize for their independent performance or even the human-AI team performance.

Conclusion: 研究表明大规模生成推理环境可以有效增强推理语言模型的推理能力，为RLVR方法的扩展提供了实证依据。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising approach for training reasoning language models (RLMs) by leveraging supervision from verifiers. Although verifier implementation is easier than solution annotation for many tasks, existing synthetic data generation methods remain largely solution-centric, while verifier-based methods rely on a few hand-crafted procedural environments. In this work, we scale RLVR by introducing ReSyn, a pipeline that generates diverse reasoning environments equipped with instance generators and verifiers, covering tasks such as constraint satisfaction, algorithmic puzzles, and spatial reasoning. A Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model trained with RL on ReSyn data achieves consistent gains across reasoning benchmarks and out-of-domain math benchmarks, including a 27\% relative improvement on the challenging BBEH benchmark. Ablations show that verifier-based supervision and increased task diversity both contribute significantly, providing empirical evidence that generating reasoning environments at scale can enhance reasoning abilities in RLMs

Motivation: 解决现实应用中多变量时间序列预测的挑战，通过分解方法分别优化趋势和季节性成分的预测，降低整体误差。

Method: 对时间序列进行分解，分别处理趋势和季节性成分：趋势部分使用可逆实例归一化，季节性部分直接应用骨干模型无需归一化。最终引入双MLP模型提高计算效率。

Result: 在四个SOTA基准模型上平均MSE降低约10%，在美国地质调查局水文数据集上也有显著改进，同时保持线性时间复杂度。

Conclusion: 提出的分解增强方法能有效提升多变量时间序列预测性能，双MLP模型在保持精度的同时提供更高的计算效率。

Abstract: Time series forecasting presents significant challenges in real-world applications across various domains. Building upon the decomposition of the time series, we enhance the architecture of machine learning models for better multivariate time series forecasting. To achieve this, we focus on the trend and seasonal components individually and investigate solutions to predict them with less errors. Recognizing that reversible instance normalization is effective only for the trend component, we take a different approach with the seasonal component by directly applying backbone models without any normalization or scaling procedures. Through these strategies, we successfully reduce error values of the existing state-of-the-art models and finally introduce dual-MLP models as more computationally efficient solutions. Furthermore, our approach consistently yields positive results with around 10% MSE average reduction across four state-of-the-art baselines on the benchmark datasets. We also evaluate our approach on a hydrological dataset extracted from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) river stations, where our models achieve significant improvements while maintaining linear time complexity, demonstrating real-world effectiveness.

Abstract: Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling is a cornerstone of model-informed drug development (MIDD), providing a mechanistic framework to predict drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). Despite its utility, adoption is hindered by high computational costs for large-scale simulations, difficulty in parameter identification for complex biological systems, and uncertainty in interspecies extrapolation. In this work, we propose a unified Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) framework that bridges mechanistic rigor and data-driven flexibility. We introduce three contributions: (1) Foundation PBPK Transformers, which treat pharmacokinetic forecasting as a sequence modeling task; (2) Physiologically Constrained Diffusion Models (PCDM), a generative approach that uses a physics-informed loss to synthesize biologically compliant virtual patient populations; and (3) Neural Allometry, a hybrid architecture combining Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with Neural ODEs to learn continuous cross-species scaling laws. Experiments on synthetic datasets show that the framework reduces physiological violation rates from 2.00% to 0.50% under constraints while offering a path to faster simulation.

Abstract: Accurate analysis of medical time series (MedTS) data, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG), plays a pivotal role in healthcare applications, including the diagnosis of brain and heart diseases. MedTS data typically exhibit two critical patterns: temporal dependencies within individual channels and channel dependencies across multiple channels. While recent advances in deep learning have leveraged Transformer-based models to effectively capture temporal dependencies, they often struggle with modeling channel dependencies. This limitation stems from a structural mismatch: MedTS signals are inherently centralized, whereas the Transformer's attention mechanism is decentralized, making it less effective at capturing global synchronization and unified waveform patterns. To address this mismatch, we propose CoTAR (Core Token Aggregation-Redistribution), a centralized MLP-based module designed to replace decentralized attention. Instead of allowing all tokens to interact directly, as in standard attention, CoTAR introduces a global core token that serves as a proxy to facilitate inter-token interactions, thereby enforcing a centralized aggregation and redistribution strategy. This design not only better aligns with the centralized nature of MedTS signals but also reduces computational complexity from quadratic to linear. Experiments on five benchmarks validate the superiority of our method in both effectiveness and efficiency, achieving up to a 12.13% improvement on the APAVA dataset, while using only 33% of the memory and 20% of the inference time compared to the previous state of the art.

Result: 在模拟雷达数据上验证了所提算法的有效性

Conclusion: SVDD和Deep SVDD方法能够有效处理重尾杂波环境中的目标检测问题，为雷达检测提供了新的替代方案

Abstract: Classical radar detection techniques rely on adaptive detectors that estimate the noise covariance matrix from target-free secondary data. While effective in Gaussian environments, these methods degrade in the presence of clutter, which is better modeled by heavy-tailed distributions such as the Complex Elliptically Symmetric (CES) and Compound-Gaussian (CGD) families. Robust covariance estimators like M-estimators or Tyler's estimator address this issue, but still struggle when thermal noise combines with clutter. To overcome these challenges, we investigate the use of Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) and its deep extension, Deep SVDD, for target detection. These one-class learning methods avoid direct noise covariance estimation and are adapted here as CFAR detectors. We propose two novel SVDD-based detection algorithms and demonstrate their effectiveness on simulated radar data.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了一个基于设计的测量系统，用于准确估计平台上违反特定政策的内容在用户浏览中的每日普遍率（prevalence），通过ML辅助加权抽样和多模态LLM标注实现高效、无偏的测量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的内容安全指标往往只反映被举报的内容，无法准确反映用户实际接触违规内容的情况。测量普遍率面临挑战：违规内容通常罕见，人工标注成本高，导致频繁、全平台代表性地研究进展缓慢。

Method: 提出基于设计的测量系统：1）每天从浏览流中进行概率抽样，使用ML辅助权重集中标注资源于高曝光和高风险内容，同时保持无偏性；2）使用多模态LLM对抽样内容进行标注，通过政策提示和黄金集验证控制质量；3）生成设计一致性的普遍率估计，提供置信区间和仪表盘下钻分析。采用“一个全局样本，多种维度分析”设计，通过后分层估计支持按界面、观众地理、内容年龄等维度的分析。

Conclusion: 该测量系统为内容安全团队提供了反映用户真实体验的指标，通过创新的抽样和标注方法实现了高效、准确的普遍率测量，支持多维度的分析和监控。

Abstract: Content safety teams need metrics that reflect what users actually experience, not only what is reported. We study prevalence: the fraction of user views (impressions) that went to content violating a given policy on a given day. Accurate prevalence measurement is challenging because violations are often rare and human labeling is costly, making frequent, platform-representative studies slow. We present a design-based measurement system that (i) draws daily probability samples from the impression stream using ML-assisted weights to concentrate label budget on high-exposure and high-risk content while preserving unbiasedness, (ii) labels sampled items with a multimodal LLM governed by policy prompts and gold-set validation, and (iii) produces design-consistent prevalence estimates with confidence intervals and dashboard drilldowns. A key design goal is one global sample with many pivots: the same daily sample supports prevalence by surface, viewer geography, content age, and other segments through post-stratified estimation. We describe the statistical estimators, variance and confidence interval construction, label-quality monitoring, and an engineering workflow that makes the system configurable across policies.

TL;DR: 传统VEA测量有偏差和限制；新方法用概率视野模型和跟踪数据创建速度依赖视觉地图；视觉指标可预测盘带收益；开放工具，兼容现有分析框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本研究旨在解决传统测量足球运动员视觉探索行为方法的局限性。传统方法依赖计算视觉探索动作（VEA），基于超过125°/s的快速头部运动，但存在球员位置偏见（主要集中在中场球员）、注释挑战、二元测量限制（扫描或不扫描）、缺乏预测短期比赛相关成功的能力，以及与基本足球分析模型（如场地控制）不兼容的问题。

Method: 本研究引入了一种新颖的公式化连续随机视觉层，通过姿态增强的时空跟踪数据量化球员的视觉感知。采用概率性视野和遮挡模型，结合头部和肩部旋转角度，为单个球员在二维俯视平面上创建速度依赖的视觉地图。将这些视觉地图与场地控制（pitch control）和场地价值（pitch value）表面相结合，分析球员在等待接球阶段（等待队友传球到达的等待期）和随后的持球阶段的表现。研究使用了2024年美洲杯32场比赛的同步姿态增强跟踪数据和持球事件数据进行验证。

Result: 研究表明，聚合的视觉指标（如等待传球时观察到的防守区域百分比）能够预测球员在盘带动作结束时获得的控制场地价值。该方法不受球员位置限制，无需人工注释，提供连续测量，并能无缝集成到现有的足球分析框架中。

Conclusion: 本研究成功开发了一种公式化连续随机视觉层方法，有效克服了传统视觉探索行为测量方法的弊端。该方法能够提供客观、连续和位置无关的视觉分析，与现有足球分析模型兼容，推动了足球运动分析的进一步发展。

Abstract: Traditional approaches to measuring visual exploratory behavior in soccer rely on counting visual exploratory actions (VEAs) based on rapid head movements exceeding 125°/s, but this method suffer from player position bias (i.e., a focus on central midfielders), annotation challenges, binary measurement constraints (i.e., a player is scanning, or not), lack the power to predict relevant short-term in-game future success, and are incompatible with fundamental soccer analytics models such as pitch control. This research introduces a novel formulaic continuous stochastic vision layer to quantify players' visual perception from pose-enhanced spatiotemporal tracking. Our probabilistic field-of-view and occlusion models incorporate head and shoulder rotation angles to create speed-dependent vision maps for individual players in a two-dimensional top-down plane. We combine these vision maps with pitch control and pitch value surfaces to analyze the awaiting phase (when a player is awaiting the ball to arrive after a pass for a teammate) and their subsequent on-ball phase. We demonstrate that aggregated visual metrics - such as the percentage of defended area observed while awaiting a pass - are predictive of controlled pitch value gained at the end of dribbling actions using 32 games of synchronized pose-enhanced tracking data and on-ball event data from the 2024 Copa America. This methodology works regardless of player position, eliminates manual annotation requirements, and provides continuous measurements that seamlessly integrate into existing soccer analytics frameworks. To further support the integration with existing soccer analytics frameworks we open-source the tools required to make these calculations.

Motivation: 传统扩散模型依赖人工调整的噪声调度，存在计算资源浪费（在信息量低的噪声区域）和跨数据集、分辨率、表示的可迁移性限制问题。

Method: 1) 从信息论角度分析前向过程的熵率，作为现有调度中噪声分布优化诊断指标；2) 提出InfoNoise方法，将启发式调度设计替换为基于训练中已有去噪损失估计的熵减少率的信息引导噪声采样分布。

Conclusion: InfoNoise为扩散模型提供了理论支持的数据自适应噪声调度框架，有效提升训练效率和跨域性能，减少人工调参负担。

Abstract: Training diffusion models typically relies on manually tuned noise schedules, which can waste computation on weakly informative noise regions and limit transfer across datasets, resolutions, and representations. We revisit noise schedule allocation through an information-theoretic lens and propose the conditional entropy rate of the forward process as a theoretically grounded, data-dependent diagnostic for identifying suboptimal noise-level allocation in existing schedules. Based on these insight, we introduce InfoNoise, a principled data-adaptive training noise schedule that replaces heuristic schedule design with an information-guided noise sampling distribution derived from entropy-reduction rates estimated from denoising losses already computed during training. Across natural-image benchmarks, InfoNoise matches or surpasses tuned EDM-style schedules, in some cases with a substantial training speedup (about $1.4\times$ on CIFAR-10). On discrete datasets, where standard image-tuned schedules exhibit significant mismatch, it reaches superior quality in up to $3\times$ fewer training steps. Overall, InfoNoise makes noise scheduling data-adaptive, reducing the need for per-dataset schedule design as diffusion models expand across domains.

Abstract: Continuous stress forecasting could potentially contribute to lifestyle interventions. This paper presents a novel, explainable, and individualized approach for stress prediction using physiological data from consumer-grade smartwatches. We develop a time series forecasting model that leverages multivariate features, including heart rate variability, activity patterns, and sleep metrics, to predict stress levels across 16 temporal horizons (History window: 3, 5, 7, 9 days; forecasting window: 1, 3, 5, 7 days). Our evaluation involves 16 participants monitored for 10-15 weeks. We evaluate our approach across 16 participants, comparing against state-of-the-art time series models (Informer, TimesNet, PatchTST) and traditional baselines (CNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM) across multiple temporal horizons. Our model achieved performance with an MSE of 0.053, MAE of 0.190, and RMSE of 0.226 in optimal settings (5-day input, 1-day prediction). A comparison with the baseline models shows that our model outperforms TimesNet, PatchTST, CNN-LSTM, LSTM, and CNN under all conditions, representing improvements of 36.9%, 25.5%, and 21.5% over the best baseline. According to the explanability analysis, sleep metrics are the most dominant and consistent stress predictors (importance: 1.1, consistency: 0.9-1.0), while activity features exhibit high inter-participant variability (0.1-0.2). Most notably, the model captures individual-specific patterns where identical features can have opposing effects across users, validating its personalization capabilities. These findings establish that consumer wearables, combined with adaptive and interpretable deep learning, can deliver relevant stress assessment adapted to individual physiological responses, providing a foundation for scalable, continuous, explainable mental health monitoring in real-world settings.

Motivation: 扩散语言模型作为自回归模型的有前景替代方案，支持并行令牌生成而不受严格左右顺序限制。然而，目前对去掩码时序如何影响生成质量的理论理解仍有限，特别是缺乏适应数据内在依赖结构的理论框架。

Method: 提出一种自适应去掩码时序方案，随机化每轮迭代中揭示的令牌数量。该方案不需要目标分布的先验知识或超参数调优，通过分析两种特定参数选择，建立了基于KL散度的收敛性理论保证。

Result: 在并行采样区域K<L（L为序列长度）下，证明了收敛性保证为Õ(TC/K)和Õ(DTC/K)，这显著改进了先前的收敛理论。对于低复杂度分布，该方案可实现大幅采样加速。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了扩散语言模型对内在数据结构的自适应能力，阐明了随机化去掩码大小在推理时序设计中的优势，为DLM的采样效率提供了理论基础和实际指导。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive (AR) approaches, enabling parallel token generation beyond a rigid left-to-right order. Despite growing empirical success, the theoretical understanding of how unmasking schedules -- which specify the order and size of unmasked tokens during sampling -- affect generation quality remains limited. In this work, we introduce a distribution-agnostic unmasking schedule for DLMs that adapts to the (unknown) dependence structure of the target data distribution, without requiring any prior knowledge or hyperparameter tuning. In contrast to prior deterministic procedures that fix unmasking sizes, our method randomizes the number of tokens revealed at each iteration. We show that, for two specific parameter choices, the sampling convergence guarantees -- measured by Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence -- scale as $\widetilde O(\mathsf{TC}/K)$ and $\widetilde O(\mathsf{DTC}/K)$ respectively. Here, $K$ is the number of iterations, and $\mathsf{TC}$ and $\mathsf{DTC}$ are the total correlation and dual total correlation of the target distribution, capturing the intrinsic dependence structure underlying the data. Importantly, our guarantees hold in the practically relevant parallel-sampling regime $K<L$ where $L$ is the token sequence length. These results significantly improve upon prior convergence theories and yield substantial sampling acceleration for low-complexity distributions. Overall, our findings unveil the adaptivity of DLMs to intrinsic data structures and shed light on the benefit of randomized unmasking sizes in inference schedule design.

TL;DR: 在多任务模块化算术任务中，Transformer模型表现出分阶段突现理解现象：乘法先泛化，然后是平方运算，最后是加法，权重衰减参数调控动态机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究单任务环境下的突现理解现象（训练损失接近零后突然从记忆转向泛化）已较充分，但多任务场景中的几何动态机制尚不明确，需要探究共享主干Transformer在多个模块化算术任务上的训练行为。

Method: 在双任务（模加+模乘）和三任务（模加+模乘+模平方）模块化算术目标上训练共享主干Transformers，进行系统性权重衰减参数扫描，通过几何分析追踪优化轨迹、流形约束和参数空间结构。

Result: 发现五个一致现象：分阶段突现理解顺序、优化轨迹局限于低维执行流形、权重衰减调控动态机制、最终解位于少量主方向但对扰动极度敏感、以及梯度组件的横向脆弱性与冗余性并存。

Conclusion: 多任务突现理解在参数空间中构建了紧凑叠加子空间，权重衰减作为压缩压力，过参数化为优化路径提供了几何冗余性，形成特定动态机制。

Abstract: Grokking -- the abrupt transition from memorization to generalization long after near-zero training loss -- has been studied mainly in single-task settings. We extend geometric analysis to multi-task modular arithmetic, training shared-trunk Transformers on dual-task (mod-add + mod-mul) and tri-task (mod-add + mod-mul + mod-sq) objectives across a systematic weight decay sweep. Five consistent phenomena emerge. (1) Staggered grokking order: multiplication generalizes first, followed by squaring, then addition, with consistent delays across seeds. (2) Universal integrability: optimization trajectories remain confined to an empirically invariant low-dimensional execution manifold; commutator defects orthogonal to this manifold reliably precede generalization. (3) Weight decay phase structure: grokking timescale, curvature depth, reconstruction threshold, and defect lead covary systematically with weight decay, revealing distinct dynamical regimes and a sharp no-decay failure mode. (4) Holographic incompressibility: final solutions occupy only 4--8 principal trajectory directions yet are distributed across full-rank weights and destroyed by minimal perturbations; SVD truncation, magnitude pruning, and uniform scaling all fail to preserve performance. (5) Transverse fragility and redundancy: removing less than 10% of orthogonal gradient components eliminates grokking, yet dual-task models exhibit partial recovery under extreme deletion, suggesting redundant center manifolds enabled by overparameterization. Together, these results support a dynamical picture in which multi-task grokking constructs a compact superposition subspace in parameter space, with weight decay acting as compression pressure and excess parameters supplying geometric redundancy in optimization pathways.

TL;DR: AV-CTTA方法通过选择性检索和动态融合层参数适应，在无源数据的情况下提升音频-视频连续测试时间适应的性能，减少灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频-视频连续测试时间适应中，模型需要持续适应未标记的非平稳测试域，其中单模态或双模态都可能发生分布偏移，这阻碍了在线跨模态学习并导致性能下降。现有方法存在灾难性遗忘问题，模型性能因持续的测试时参数更新而显著低于源模型。

Method: 提出AV-CTTA方法：仅适应模态融合层到目标域不仅能提升当前域性能，还能增强后续域表现。基于融合层参数的强跨任务可迁移性，采用选择性参数检索机制，利用少量测试数据批次动态从缓冲区检索最佳融合层参数，将其整合到模型中，适应当前测试分布，并保存供未来使用。

Result: 在涉及单模态和双模态扰动的基准数据集上进行广泛实验，结果显示AV-CTTA方法显著优于现有方法，同时最小化了灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: 通过选择性融合层参数适应和动态检索机制，AV-CTTA在无源数据的情况下有效提升了音频-视频连续测试时间适应的性能，解决了灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Audio-visual continual test-time adaptation involves continually adapting a source audio-visual model at test-time, to unlabeled non-stationary domains, where either or both modalities can be distributionally shifted, which hampers online cross-modal learning and eventually leads to poor accuracy. While previous works have tackled this problem, we find that SOTA methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where the model's performance drops well below the source model due to continual parameter updates at test-time. In this work, we first show that adapting only the modality fusion layer to a target domain not only improves performance on that domain but can also enhance performance on subsequent domains. Based on this strong cross-task transferability of the fusion layer's parameters, we propose a method, $\texttt{AV-CTTA}$, that improves test-time performance of the models without access to any source data. Our approach works by using a selective parameter retrieval mechanism that dynamically retrieves the best fusion layer parameters from a buffer using only a small batch of test data. These parameters are then integrated into the model, adapted to the current test distribution, and saved back for future use. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets involving unimodal and bimodal corruptions show our proposed $\texttt{AV-CTTA}$ significantly outperforms existing methods while minimizing catastrophic forgetting.

Abstract: The energy management problem in the context of smart grids is inherently complex due to the interdependencies among diverse system components. Although Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been proposed for solving Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problems, the requirement for iterative interaction with an environment often necessitates computationally expensive simulators, leading to significant sample inefficiency. In this study, these challenges are addressed through the use of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which can replace conventional and costly smart grid simulators. The RL policy learning process is enhanced so that convergence can be achieved in a fraction of the time required by the original environment. The PINN-based surrogate is compared with other benchmark data-driven surrogate models. By incorporating knowledge of the underlying physical laws, the results show that the PINN surrogate is the only approach considered in this context that can obtain a strong RL policy even without access to samples from the true simulator. The results demonstrate that using PINN surrogates can accelerate training by 50% compared to RL training without a surrogate. This approach enables the rapid generation of performance scores similar to those produced by the original simulator.

TL;DR: 本文研究了通过结合卫星雷达物理开发信号和新闻文本市场叙事，在子城市区域预测周度房价指数的方法。基于迪拜房地产交易数据构建的19个子区域周度指数显示，不同预测期限下各模态的有效性有显著差异：短期预测中价格历史足矣，但长期预测需要整合多模态信息，其中Sentinel-1 SAR数据和新闻情绪对提升预测精度起关键作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的房地产价格指标通常在市级层面发布且频率较低，这限制了其在社区层面监测和长期规划中的应用。因此，本文旨在探索能否通过卫星遥感数据和非结构化新闻文本的结合，实现子城市区域高频率（周度）房价指数的预测，以提供更精细和及时的房地产市场洞察。

Method: 研究利用迪拜土地部门2015-2025年间的超过35万笔交易数据，构建了19个子城市区域的周度房价指数。提出的预测框架融合了区域交易历史、Sentinel-1 SAR雷达后向散射数据、结合词汇基调与语义嵌入的新闻情绪，以及宏观经济学上下文。对不同预测期限（从2周到34周）的预测性能进行了评估，并对比了仅使用价格历史的模型与整合多模态信息的模型，以及非参数学习器与深度学习架构的表现。

Result: 预测结果表现出强烈的期限依赖性：在不超过10周的短期预测中，仅使用价格历史的模型即可达到与多模态配置相当的水平；但当预测期限超过14周时，新闻情绪和SAR数据变得至关重要。在超长期预测（26-34周）中，完全的多模态模型将平均绝对误差（MAE）从4.48降低至2.93，实现了35%的误差降低，且此增益在统计上所有区域都显著。此外，非参数学习器在该数据体系下持续超越了深度架构的表现。

Conclusion: 这些发现为周度子城市指数预测设立了重要基准，并证明了遥感数据和新闻情绪可在具有战略意义的预测期限上，实质性提升房地产价格的预测能力。研究表明，整合多个数据源（尤其是对长期预测至关重要的物理开发信号和市场叙事信号）能有效揭示传统价格数据之外的动态信息，为非结构化数据在房地产市场分析中的应用提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Reliable real estate price indicators are typically published at city level and low frequency, limiting their use for neighborhood-scale monitoring and long-horizon planning. We study whether sub-city price indices can be forecasted at weekly frequency by combining physical development signals from satellite radar with market narratives from news text. Using over 350,000 transactions from Dubai Land Department (2015-2025), we construct weekly price indices for 19 sub-city regions and evaluate forecasts from 2 to 34 weeks ahead. Our framework fuses regional transaction history with Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter, news sentiment combining lexical tone and semantic embeddings, and macroeconomic context. Results are strongly horizon dependent: at horizons up to 10 weeks, price history alone matches multimodal configurations, but beyond 14 weeks sentiment and SAR become critical. At long horizons (26-34 weeks), the full multimodal model reduces mean absolute error from 4.48 to 2.93 (35% reduction), with gains statistically significant across regions. Nonparametric learners consistently outperform deep architectures in this data regime. These findings establish benchmarks for weekly sub-city index forecasting and demonstrate that remote sensing and news sentiment materially improve predictability at strategically relevant horizons.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无明确目标函数的学习框架，系统通过评估内部动力学健康度来调节结构可塑性，而非最小化外部误差信号。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习依赖于显式标量目标函数的优化，但在目标模糊、变化或缺失的自主系统中，这种范式失效。系统需要自我评估其内部动力学是否健康，并在无外部监督下调节结构变化。

Method: 引入双时间尺度架构：快速状态演化和慢速结构适应，通过内部生成的累积压力变量耦合。结构修改不是连续触发，而是作为状态依赖事件。使用最小玩具模型演示压力调节机制。

Result: 该机制在没有外部定义目标的情况下，产生了时间上分段的自我组织学习阶段。

Conclusion: 这种方法为能够自我评估和内部调节结构重组的自主学习系统提供了可能的途径。

Abstract: Despite their apparent diversity, modern machine learning methods can be reduced to a remarkably simple core principle: learning is achieved by continuously optimizing parameters to minimize or maximize a scalar objective function. This paradigm has been extraordinarily successful for well-defined tasks where goals are fixed and evaluation criteria are explicit. However, if artificial systems are to move toward true autonomy-operating over long horizons and across evolving contexts-objectives may become ill-defined, shifting, or entirely absent. In such settings, a fundamental question emerges: in the absence of an explicit objective function, how can a system determine whether its ongoing internal dynamics are productive or pathological? And how should it regulate structural change without external supervision? In this work, we propose a dynamical framework for learning without an explicit objective. Instead of minimizing external error signals, the system evaluates the intrinsic health of its own internal dynamics and regulates structural plasticity accordingly. We introduce a two-timescale architecture that separates fast state evolution from slow structural adaptation, coupled through an internally generated stress variable that accumulates evidence of persistent dynamical dysfunction. Structural modification is then triggered not continuously, but as a state-dependent event. Through a minimal toy model, we demonstrate that this stress-regulated mechanism produces temporally segmented, self-organized learning episodes without reliance on externally defined goals. Our results suggest a possible route toward autonomous learning systems capable of self-assessment and internally regulated structural reorganization.

TL;DR: GIST 是一种用于参数高效微调(PEFT)的数据选择方法，通过子空间对齐替代基于Adam统计量的轴对齐方法，显著降低存储和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于优化器统计量（如Adam状态）的数据选择方法在PEFT（如LoRA）中失效，因为PEFT的优化几何存在强参数耦合和非对角线相互作用，而任务相关更新方向限于低维子空间。需要更匹配的方法进行高效数据选择。

Method: GIST通过谱滤波(SVD)从验证梯度恢复任务特定子空间，将训练梯度投影到该耦合子空间中，并依据与目标方向的对齐程度给示例评分。

Result: 在相同选择预算下，GIST仅需0.29%的存储空间和25%的计算时间，即可达到或超越最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: GIST为参数高效微调中的高效数据选择提供了简单而原则性的解决方案，通过子空间对齐有效处理参数耦合特性，大幅降低资源消耗。

Abstract: Targeted data selection has emerged as a crucial paradigm for efficient instruction tuning, aiming to identify a small yet influential subset of training examples for a specific target task. In practice, influence is often measured through the effect of an example on parameter updates. To make selection scalable, many approaches leverage optimizer statistics (e.g., Adam states) as an axis-aligned surrogate for update geometry (i.e., diagonal precondition), implicitly treating parameters as coordinate-wise independent. We show that this assumption breaks down in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as LoRA. In this setting, the induced optimization geometry exhibits strong cross-parameter coupling with non-trivial off-diagonal interactions, while the task-relevant update directions are confined to a low-dimensional subspace. Motivated by this mismatch, we propose GIST (Gradient Isometric Subspace Transformation), a simple yet principled alternative that replaces axis-aligned scaling with robust subspace alignment. GIST recovers a task-specific subspace from validation gradients via spectral filtering (SVD), projects training gradients into this coupled subspace, and scores examples by their alignment with target directions.Extensive experiments have demonstrated that GIST matches or outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline with only 0.29% of the storage and 25% of the computational time under the same selection budget.

Motivation: 在多任务学习中，识别哪些任务应该一起学习是一个基本问题。穷举所有任务组合进行训练的代价过高，因此需要高效预测任务组是否能从共同学习中获益。

Abstract: A fundamental problem in multi-task learning (MTL) is identifying groups of tasks that should be learned together. Since training MTL models for all possible combinations of tasks is prohibitively expensive for large task sets, a crucial component of efficient and effective task grouping is predicting whether a group of tasks would benefit from learning together, measured as per-task performance gain over single-task learning. In this paper, we propose ETAP (Ensemble Task Affinity Predictor), a scalable framework that integrates principled and data-driven estimators to predict MTL performance gains. First, we consider the gradient-based updates of shared parameters in an MTL model to measure the affinity between a pair of tasks as the similarity between the parameter updates based on these tasks. This linear estimator, which we call affinity score, naturally extends to estimating affinity within a group of tasks. Second, to refine these estimates, we train predictors that apply non-linear transformations and correct residual errors, capturing complex and non-linear task relationships. We train these predictors on a limited number of task groups for which we obtain ground-truth gain values via multi-task learning for each group. We demonstrate on benchmark datasets that ETAP improves MTL gain prediction and enables more effective task grouping, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines across diverse application domains.

Abstract: Systematic evaluation of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is crucial for advancing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). However, existing benchmarks remain insufficient for rigorously assessing their constrained reasoning capabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce MapTab, a multimodal benchmark specifically designed to evaluate constrained reasoning in MLLMs via route planning tasks. MapTab requires MLLMs to perceive and ground visual cues from map images alongside route attributes (e.g., Time, Price) from structured tabular data. The benchmark encompasses two scenarios: Metromap, covering metro networks in 160 cities across 52 countries, and Travelmap, depicting 168 representative tourist attractions from 19 countries. In total, MapTab comprises 328 images, 196,800 route planning queries, and 3,936 QA queries, all incorporating 4 key constraints: Time, Price, Comfort, and Reliability. Extensive evaluations across 15 representative MLLMs reveal that current models face substantial challenges in constrained multimodal reasoning. Notably, under conditions of limited visual perception, multimodal collaboration often underperforms compared to unimodal approaches. We believe MapTab provides a challenging and realistic testbed to advance the systematic evaluation of MLLMs.

Abstract: Standard reranking evaluations study how a reranker orders candidates returned by an upstream retriever. This setup couples ranking behavior with retrieval quality, so differences in output cannot be attributed to the ranking policy alone. We introduce a controlled diagnostic that isolates reranking by using Multi-News clusters as fixed evidence pools. We limit each pool to exactly eight documents and pass identical inputs to all rankers. Within this setup, BM25 and MMR serve as interpretable reference points for lexical matching and diversity optimization. Across 345 clusters, we find that redundancy patterns vary by model: one LLM implicitly diversifies at larger selection budgets, while another increases redundancy. In contrast, LLMs underperform on lexical coverage at small selection budgets. As a result, LLM rankings diverge substantially from both baselines rather than consistently approximating either strategy. By eliminating retrieval variance, we can attribute these differences directly to the ranking policy. This diagnostic is model-agnostic and applicable to any ranker, including open source systems and proprietary APIs.

Abstract: World models learned from high-dimensional visual observations allow agents to make decisions and plan directly in latent space, avoiding pixel-level reconstruction. However, recent latent predictive architectures (JEPAs), including the DINO world model (DINO-WM), display a degradation in test time robustness due to their sensitivity to "slow features". These include visual variations such as background changes and distractors that are irrelevant to the task being solved. We address this limitation by augmenting the predictive objective with a bisimulation encoder that enforces control-relevant state equivalence, mapping states with similar transition dynamics to nearby latent states while limiting contributions from slow features. We evaluate our model on a simple navigation task under different test-time background changes and visual distractors. Across all benchmarks, our model consistently improves robustness to slow features while operating in a reduced latent space, up to 10x smaller than that of DINO-WM. Moreover, our model is agnostic to the choice of pretrained visual encoder and maintains robustness when paired with DINOv2, SimDINOv2, and iBOT features.

Motivation: 现有时间序列推理方法通常将整个时间序列编码为固定表示，无论序列是否全部相关。这种静态处理方式无法有效处理仅需分析少数关键区间或罕见事件的时间序列任务

Method: 提出ARTIST框架，采用控制器-推理器架构：控制器通过强化学习训练以选择信息丰富的时间段，推理器生成基于选定片段的推理轨迹和最终答案。使用分层策略优化方法进行后训练，优化片段选择与问答行为

Result: 在六个时间序列推理基准测试中，ARTIST比最强基线平均准确率提升6.46个百分点，在罕见事件定位和多片段推理任务中提升最明显。监督微调进一步提升性能，强化学习通过优化问题自适应片段选择提供额外收益

Conclusion: 选择性使用数据驱动有效的时间序列推理。主动获取任务相关信息而非依赖完整序列的静态摘要，能显著提升模型在时间序列推理任务中的性能

Abstract: Time series reasoning tasks often start with a natural language question and require targeted analysis of a time series. Evidence may span the full series or appear in a few short intervals, so the model must decide what to inspect. Most existing approaches encode the entire time series into a fixed representation before inference, regardless of whether or not the entire sequence is relevant. We introduce ARTIST, which formulates time-series reasoning as a sequential decision problem. ARTIST interleaves reasoning with adaptive temporal segment selection. It adopts a controller-reasoner architecture and uses reinforcement learning to train the controller role to select informative segments and the reasoner role to generate segment-conditioned reasoning traces and final answers. During inference, the model actively acquires task-relevant information instead of relying on a static summary of the full sequence. We use a novel hierarchical policy optimization approach for post-training that allows the model to excel in both segment selection and question-answering behavior. We evaluate ARTIST on six time-series reasoning benchmarks and compare it with large language models, vision-language models, and prior time-series reasoning systems. ARTIST improves average accuracy by 6.46 absolute percentage points over the strongest baseline. The largest gains appear on rare event localization and multi-segment reasoning tasks. Supervised fine-tuning improves performance, and reinforcement learning provides additional gains by optimizing question-adaptive segment selection. These results show that selective data use drives effective time-series reasoning.

Abstract: Grokking -- the abrupt transition from memorization to generalization after extended training -- has been linked to the emergence of low-dimensional structure in learning dynamics. Yet neural network parameters inhabit extremely high-dimensional spaces. How can a low-dimensional learning process produce solutions that resist low-dimensional compression?
  We investigate this question in multi-task modular arithmetic, training shared-trunk Transformers with separate heads for addition, multiplication, and a quadratic operation modulo 97. Across three model scales (315K--2.2M parameters) and five weight decay settings, we compare three reconstruction methods: per-matrix SVD, joint cross-matrix SVD, and trajectory PCA.
  Across all conditions, grokking trajectories are confined to a 2--6 dimensional global subspace, while individual weight matrices remain effectively full-rank. Reconstruction from 3--5 trajectory PCs recovers over 95\% of final accuracy, whereas both per-matrix and joint SVD fail at sub-full rank. Even when static decompositions capture most spectral energy, they destroy task-relevant structure.
  These results show that learned algorithms are encoded through dynamically coordinated updates spanning all matrices, rather than localized low-rank components. We term this the holographic encoding principle: grokked solutions are globally low-rank in the space of learning directions but locally full-rank in parameter space, with implications for compression, interpretability, and understanding how neural networks encode computation.

Abstract: Networks of interdependent industrial assets (clients) are tightly coupled through physical processes and control inputs, raising a key question: how would the output of one client change if another client were operated differently? This is difficult to answer because client-specific data are high-dimensional and private, making centralization of raw data infeasible. Each client also maintains proprietary local models that cannot be modified. We propose a federated framework for causal representation learning in state-space systems that captures interdependencies among clients under these constraints. Each client maps high-dimensional observations into low-dimensional latent states that disentangle intrinsic dynamics from control-driven influences. A central server estimates the global state-transition and control structure. This enables decentralized counterfactual reasoning where clients predict how outputs would change under alternative control inputs at others while only exchanging compact latent states. We prove convergence to a centralized oracle and provide privacy guarantees. Our experiments demonstrate scalability, and accurate cross-client counterfactual inference on synthetic and real-world industrial control system datasets.

Conclusion: Potara提供了一个原则性的联邦个性化框架，通过理论推导的最优合并权重，有效平衡通用和个性化知识，解决了任务异构环境下的联邦学习个性化挑战，同时降低了通信成本

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as LoRA, offer a practical way to adapt large vision and language models to client tasks. However, this becomes particularly challenging under task-level heterogeneity in federated deployments. In this regime, personalization requires balancing general knowledge with personalized knowledge, yet existing approaches largely rely on heuristic mixing rules and lack theoretical justification. Moreover, prior model merging approaches are also computation and communication intensive, making the process inefficient in federated settings. In this work, we propose Potara, a principled framework for federated personalization that constructs a personalized model for each client by merging two complementary models: (i) a federated model capturing general knowledge, and (ii) a local model capturing personalized knowledge. Through the construct of linear mode connectivity, we show that the expected task loss admits a variance trace upper bound, whose minimization yields closed-form optimal mixing weights that guarantee a tighter bound for the merged model than for either the federated or local model alone. Experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that Potara consistently improves personalization while reducing communication, leading to a strong performance-communication trade-off.

Abstract: Large-scale foundation models for scientific machine learning adapt to physical settings unseen during training, such as zero-shot transfer between turbulent scales. This phenomenon, in-context learning, challenges conventional understanding of learning and adaptation in physical systems. Here, we study in-context learning of dynamical systems in a minimal setting: we train a small two-layer, single-head transformer to forecast one dynamical system, and then evaluate its ability to forecast a different dynamical system without retraining. We discover an early tradeoff in training between in-distribution and out-of-distribution performance, which manifests as a secondary double descent phenomenon. We discover that attention-based models apply a transfer-operator forecasting strategy in-context. They (1) lift low-dimensional time series using delay embedding, to detect the system's higher-dimensional dynamical manifold, and (2) identify and forecast long-lived invariant sets that characterize the global flow on this manifold. Our results clarify the mechanism enabling large pretrained models to forecast unseen physical systems at test without retraining, and they illustrate the unique ability of attention-based models to leverage global attractor information in service of short-term forecasts.

Abstract: Planning-based reinforcement learning for continuous control is bottlenecked by two practical issues: planning at primitive time scales leads to prohibitive branching and long horizons, while real environments are frequently partially observable and exhibit regime shifts that invalidate stationary, fully observed dynamics assumptions. We introduce I-TAP (In-Context Latent Temporal-Abstraction Planner), an offline RL framework that unifies in-context adaptation with online planning in a learned discrete temporal-abstraction space. From offline trajectories, I-TAP learns an observation-conditioned residual-quantization VAE that compresses each observation-macro-action segment into a coarse-to-fine stack of discrete residual tokens, and a temporal Transformer that autoregressively predicts these token stacks from a short recent history. The resulting sequence model acts simultaneously as a context-conditioned prior over abstract actions and a latent dynamics model. At test time, I-TAP performs Monte Carlo Tree Search directly in token space, using short histories for implicit adaptation without gradient update, and decodes selected token stacks into executable actions. Across deterministic MuJoCo, stochastic MuJoCo with per-episode latent dynamics regimes, and high-dimensional Adroit manipulation, including partially observable variants, I-TAP consistently matches or outperforms strong model-free and model-based offline baselines, demonstrating efficient and robust in-context planning under stochastic dynamics and partial observability.

Abstract: In many domains generating variable length sequences through insertions provides greater flexibility over autoregressive models. However, the action space of insertion models is much larger than that of autoregressive models (ARMs) making the learning challenging. To address this, we incorporate trainable order dynamics into the target rates for discrete flow matching, and show that with suitable choices of parameterizations, joint training of the target order dynamics and the generator is tractable without the need for numerical simulation. As the generative insertion model, we use a variable length masked diffusion model, which generates by inserting and filling mask tokens. On graph traversal tasks for which a locally optimal insertion order is known, we explore the choices of parameterization empirically and demonstrate the trade-offs between flexibility, training stability and generation quality. On de novo small molecule generation, we find that the learned order dynamics leads to an increase in the number of valid molecules generated and improved quality, when compared to uniform order dynamics.

TL;DR: 提出相位一致的磁谱学习，通过显式建模跨视图方向一致性作为相位项、结合非负幅度构建复值磁亲和矩阵，提取稳定的共享谱信号，指导无监督多视图聚类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督多视图聚类面临的主要挑战是：在视图差异和噪声下，如何获得可靠的共享结构信号来指导表示学习和跨视图对齐。现有方法通常仅依赖幅度相似性或早期伪目标，当不同视图产生强度相当但方向矛盾的关系时，这些方法会变得不稳定，从而扭曲全局谱几何并降低聚类性能。

Method: 1）将跨视图方向一致性显式建模为相位项，结合非负幅度支构建复值磁亲和矩阵；
2）通过厄米特磁拉普拉斯矩阵提取稳定的共享谱信号；
3）将该谱信号作为结构化自监督来指导无监督多视图表示学习和聚类；
4）为可扩展地获得鲁棒的谱提取输入，使用基于锚点的高阶共识建模构造紧凑共享结构，并应用轻量级细化抑制噪声或不一致关系。

Result: 在多个公开的多视图基准数据集上进行广泛实验，结果表明该方法持续优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过相位一致的磁谱学习，能够有效建模跨视图方向一致性，提取稳定共享谱信号，从而显著提升无监督多视图聚类的性能。相位建模为处理视图间矛盾关系提供了新思路。

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-view clustering (MVC) aims to partition data into meaningful groups by leveraging complementary information from multiple views without labels, yet a central challenge is to obtain a reliable shared structural signal to guide representation learning and cross-view alignment under view discrepancy and noise. Existing approaches often rely on magnitude-only affinities or early pseudo targets, which can be unstable when different views induce relations with comparable strengths but contradictory directional tendencies, thereby distorting the global spectral geometry and degrading clustering. In this paper, we propose \emph{Phase-Consistent Magnetic Spectral Learning} for MVC: we explicitly model cross-view directional agreement as a phase term and combine it with a nonnegative magnitude backbone to form a complex-valued magnetic affinity, extract a stable shared spectral signal via a Hermitian magnetic Laplacian, and use it as structured self-supervision to guide unsupervised multi-view representation learning and clustering. To obtain robust inputs for spectral extraction at scale, we construct a compact shared structure with anchor-based high-order consensus modeling and apply a lightweight refinement to suppress noisy or inconsistent relations. Extensive experiments on multiple public multi-view benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong baselines.

Abstract: Training data leakage from Large Language Models (LLMs) raises serious concerns related to privacy, security, and copyright compliance. A central challenge in assessing this risk is distinguishing genuine memorization of training data from the generation of statistically common sequences. Existing approaches to measuring memorization often conflate these phenomena, labeling outputs as memorized even when they arise from generalization over common patterns. Counterfactual Memorization provides a principled solution by comparing models trained with and without a target sequence, but its reliance on retraining multiple baseline models makes it computationally expensive and impractical at scale.
  This work introduces Prior-Aware Memorization, a theoretically grounded, lightweight and training-free criterion for identifying genuine memorization in LLMs. The key idea is to evaluate whether a candidate suffix is strongly associated with its specific training prefix or whether it appears with high probability across many unrelated prompts due to statistical commonality.
  We evaluate this metric on text from the training corpora of two pre-trained models, LLaMA and OPT, using both long sequences (to simulate copyright risks) and named entities (to simulate PII leakage). Our results show that between 55% and 90% of sequences previously labeled as memorized are in fact statistically common. Similar findings hold for the SATML training data extraction challenge dataset, where roughly 40% of sequences exhibit common-pattern behavior despite appearing only once in the training data. These results demonstrate that low frequency alone is insufficient evidence of memorization and highlight the importance of accounting for model priors when assessing leakage.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了首个针对生成式世界模型的白盒攻击方法PhysCond-WMA，通过扰动物理条件通道（如高精地图嵌入和3D框特征）来诱导语义、逻辑或决策层面的失真，同时保持感知保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式世界模型（WMs）越来越多地用于合成可控的、传感器条件的驾驶视频，但它们对物理先验的依赖性暴露了新的攻击面。研究者旨在揭示和量化生成式世界模型的安全漏洞，以推动更全面的安全检查。

Method: PhysCond-WMA采用两阶段优化：1）质量保留引导阶段，将反向扩散损失限制在校准阈值下；2）动量引导去噪阶段，沿着去噪轨迹积累与目标对齐的梯度，以实现稳定的、时间上连贯的语义偏移。攻击针对物理条件通道（如HDMap嵌入和3D-box特征）进行扰动。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在平均增加FID约9%和FVD约3.9%的情况下仍保持有效。在定向攻击设置下，攻击成功率（ASR）达到0.55。下游研究进一步显示，使用受攻击视频进行训练会降低3D检测性能约4%，并使开环规划性能恶化约20%。

Conclusion: 这是首次揭示并量化了生成式世界模型中的安全漏洞，强调了在自动驾驶等领域应用生成式世界模型时需要考虑的安全隐患，并呼吁开发更全面的安全检查机制。

Abstract: Generative world models (WMs) are increasingly used to synthesize controllable, sensor-conditioned driving videos, yet their reliance on physical priors exposes novel attack surfaces. In this paper, we present Physical-Conditioned World Model Attack (PhysCond-WMA), the first white-box world model attack that perturbs physical-condition channels, such as HDMap embeddings and 3D-box features, to induce semantic, logic, or decision-level distortion while preserving perceptual fidelity. PhysCond-WMA is optimized in two stages: (1) a quality-preserving guidance stage that constrains reverse-diffusion loss below a calibrated threshold, and (2) a momentum-guided denoising stage that accumulates target-aligned gradients along the denoising trajectory for stable, temporally coherent semantic shifts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach remains effective while increasing FID by about 9% on average and FVD by about 3.9% on average. Under the targeted attack setting, the attack success rate (ASR) reaches 0.55. Downstream studies further show tangible risk, which using attacked videos for training decreases 3D detection performance by about 4%, and worsens open-loop planning performance by about 20%. These findings has for the first time revealed and quantified security vulnerabilities in generative world models, driving more comprehensive security checkers.

Abstract: Radio maps are essential for efficient radio resource management in future 6G and low-altitude networks. While deep learning (DL) techniques have emerged as an efficient alternative to conventional ray-tracing for radio map estimation (RME), most existing DL approaches are confined to 2D near-ground scenarios. They often fail to capture essential 3D signal propagation characteristics and antenna polarization effects, primarily due to the scarcity of 3D data and training challenges. To address these limitations, we present the RadioGen3D framework. First, we propose an efficient data synthesis method to generate high-quality 3D radio map data. By establishing a parametric target model that captures 2D ray-tracing and 3D channel fading characteristics, we derive realistic coefficient combinations from minimal real measurements, enabling the construction of a large-scale synthetic dataset, Radio3DMix. Utilizing this dataset, we propose a 3D model training scheme based on a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN), yielding a 3D U-Net capable of accurate RME under diverse input feature combinations. Experimental results demonstrate that RadioGen3D surpasses all baselines in both estimation accuracy and speed. Furthermore, fine-tuning experiments verify its strong generalization capability via successful knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Understanding disease-gene associations is essential for unravelling disease mechanisms and advancing diagnostics and therapeutics. Traditional approaches based on manual curation and literature review are labour-intensive and not scalable, prompting the use of machine learning on large biomedical data. In particular, graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise for modelling complex biological relationships. To address limitations in existing models, we propose GLaDiGAtor (Graph Learning-bAsed DIsease-Gene AssociaTiOn pRediction), a novel GNN framework with an encoder-decoder architecture for disease-gene association prediction. GLaDiGAtor constructs a heterogeneous biological graph integrating gene-gene, disease-disease, and gene-disease interactions from curated databases, and enriches each node with contextual features from well-known language models (ProtT5 for protein sequences and BioBERT for disease text). In evaluations, our model achieves superior predictive accuracy and generalisation, outperforming 14 existing methods. Literature-supported case studies confirm the biological relevance of high-confidence novel predictions, highlighting GLaDiGAtor's potential to discover candidate disease genes. These results underscore the power of graph convolutional networks in biomedical informatics and may ultimately facilitate drug discovery by revealing new gene-disease links.

Abstract: Ad ranking systems must simultaneously optimize multiple objectives including click-through rate (CTR), conversion rate (CVR), revenue, and user experience metrics. However, production systems face critical challenges: score scale inconsistency across traffic segments undermines threshold transferability, and position bias in click logs causes offline-online metric discrepancies. We propose CaliCausalRank, a unified framework that integrates training-time scale calibration, constraint-based multi-objective optimization, and robust counterfactual utility estimation. Our approach treats score calibration as a first-class training objective rather than post-hoc processing, employs Lagrangian relaxation for constraint satisfaction, and utilizes variance-reduced counterfactual estimators for reliable offline evaluation. Experiments on the Criteo and Avazu datasets demonstrate that CaliCausalRank achieves 1.1% relative AUC improvement, 31.6% calibration error reduction, and 3.2% utility gain compared to the best baseline (PairRank) while maintaining consistent performance across different traffic segments.

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) is critical for identifying abnormal nodes in graph-structured data from diverse domains, including cybersecurity and social networks. The existing GAD methods often focus on the learning paradigms of "one-model-for-one-dataset", requiring dataset-specific training for each dataset to achieve optimal performance. However, this paradigm suffers from significant limitations, such as high computational and data costs, limited generalization and transferability to new datasets, and challenges in privacy-sensitive scenarios where access to full datasets or sufficient labels is restricted. To address these limitations, we propose a novel generalist GAD paradigm that aims to develop a unified model capable of detecting anomalies on multiple unseen datasets without extensive retraining/fine-tuning or dataset-specific customization. To this end, we propose ARC, a few-shot generalist GAD method that leverages in-context learning and requires only a few labeled normal samples at inference time. Specifically, ARC consists of three core modules: a feature Alignment module to unify and align features across datasets, a Residual GNN encoder to capture dataset-agnostic anomaly representations, and a cross-attentive in-Context learning module to score anomalies using few-shot normal context. Building on ARC, we further introduce ARC_zero for the zero-shot generalist GAD setting, which selects representative pseudo-normal nodes via a pseudo-context mechanism and thus enables fully label-free inference on unseen datasets. Extensive experiments on 17 real-world graph datasets demonstrate that both ARC and ARC_zero effectively detect anomalies, exhibit strong generalization ability, and perform efficiently under few-shot and zero-shot settings.

Abstract: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a foundational model for discovering latent thematic structure in discrete data, but its Dirichlet prior cannot represent the rich correlations and hierarchical relationships often present among topics. We introduce the framework of Latent Dirichlet-Tree Allocation (LDTA), a generalization of LDA that replaces the Dirichlet prior with an arbitrary Dirichlet-Tree (DT) distribution. LDTA preserves LDA's generative structure but enables expressive, tree-structured priors over topic proportions. To perform inference, we develop universal mean-field variational inference and Expectation Propagation, providing tractable updates for all DT. We reveal the vectorized nature of the two inference methods through theoretical development, and perform fully vectorized, GPU-accelerated implementations. The resulting framework substantially expands the modeling capacity of LDA while maintaining scalability and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: SGNO通过分离线性生成器的逼近误差和非线性失配，并且约束了潜在L2范数的增长，从而实现了更稳定和准确的长期偏微分方程预测。

Abstract: Neural operators provide fast PDE surrogates and often generalize across parameters and resolutions. However, in the short train long test setting, autoregressive rollouts can become unstable. This typically happens for two reasons: one step errors accumulate over time, and high frequency components feed back and grow.
  We introduce the Spectral Generator Neural Operator (SGNO), a residual time stepper that targets both effects. For the linear part, SGNO uses an exponential time differencing update in Fourier space with a learned diagonal generator. We constrain the real part of this generator to be nonpositive, so iterating the step does not amplify the linear dynamics. For nonlinear dynamics, SGNO adds a gated forcing term with channel mixing within each Fourier mode, which keeps the nonlinear update controlled. To further limit high frequency feedback, SGNO applies spectral truncation and an optional smooth mask on the forcing pathway.
  We derive a one step amplification bound and a finite horizon rollout error bound. The bound separates generator approximation error from nonlinear mismatch and gives sufficient conditions under which the latent $L^2$ norm does not grow across rollout steps. On APEBench spanning 1D, 2D, and 3D PDE families, SGNO achieves lower long horizon error and longer stable rollout lengths than strong neural operator baselines. Ablations confirm the roles of the generator constraint, gating, and filtering.The code is available at https://github.com/lijy32123-cloud/SGNO.

Abstract: Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) are a useful tool for uncertainty quantification, but require substantially more computational resources than conventional neural networks. For non-Bayesian networks, the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) posits the existence of sparse subnetworks that can train to the same or even surpassing accuracy as the original dense network. Such sparse networks can lower the demand for computational resources at inference, and during training. The existence of the LTH and corresponding sparse subnetworks in BNNs could motivate the development of sparse training algorithms and provide valuable insights into the underlying training process. Towards this end, we translate the LTH experiments to a Bayesian setting using common computer vision models. We investigate the defining characteristics of Bayesian lottery tickets, and extend our study towards a transplantation method connecting BNNs with deterministic Lottery Tickets. We generally find that the LTH holds in BNNs, and winning tickets of matching and surpassing accuracy are present independent of model size, with degradation at very high sparsities. However, the pruning strategy should rely primarily on magnitude, secondly on standard deviation. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that models rely on mask structure and weight initialization to varying degrees.

Abstract: Despite powering modern AI, transformers remain mysteriously brittle to train. We develop a stability theory that explains why pre-LayerNorm works, why DeepNorm uses $N^{-1/4}$ scaling, and why warmup is necessary, all from first principles. Our framework has two pillars: (1) We derive the \emph{exact} operator norm of the softmax Jacobian, $\|J_{softmax}(u/τ)\|_{\infty\to 1} = θ(p)/τ$, where the balanced-mass factor $θ(p)\in[0,1]$ quantifies attention sensitivity. (2) We introduce a block-$\infty$/RMS geometry aligned with tokenwise computation, yielding Lipschitz bounds independent of sequence length. Using this framework, we prove that pre-LN preserves identity gradient paths while post-LN compounds LayerNorm Jacobians exponentially with depth, and we show that DeepNorm's $N^{-1/4}$ emerges from the quartic structure of attention's four projection matrices. We validate our theory on 774M-parameter models and find that, contrary to the intuition that attention sharpens during training to reduce sensitivity, $θ(p) \approx 1$ persists throughout. Transformer stability arises entirely from architectural gradient flow, not from attention dynamics. This finding changes how we reason about training: the architecture itself must handle sensitivity, not learned attention patterns.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于注意力矩阵低秩结构的集中不等式，用于更精确地估计注意力分数的最大值分布，并基于此设计了几何感知的缩放因子，可在FP8训练中提供理论上的溢出保证而无需观察激活值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统注意力分数集中性分析忽略了交互矩阵的低秩结构，导致对最大值分布的估计过于保守。在低精度训练（如FP8）中，这可能导致溢出风险估计不准确，影响训练稳定性。

Method: 1.推导了秩感知集中不等式，当注意力交互矩阵M的秩r远小于维度d时，最大注意力分数的尾概率以exp(-d^2α^2/(γr))衰减而非exp(-dα^2)。2.基于此设计了几何感知缩放因子，通过隐式幂迭代计算谱范数\|W^QW^{K⊤}\|_2来确定每层缩放参数。3.提出了分组查询注意力方案避免键扩展，保持与融合注意力内核的兼容性。

Result: 在GPT-2XL到Llama-2-70B等现代架构上，该方法相比传统秩不敏感边界提供了8-28倍更紧的集中性估计。在实际FP8训练中，几何感知缩放消除了延迟缩放失败情况下的溢出问题，同时在MMLU下游任务上保持了相当的准确率。

Conclusion: 利用注意力矩阵的低秩特性可以显著改进对注意力分数最大值分布的估计，为低精度训练中的溢出控制提供了理论保证。几何感知缩放方法在实际大规模模型中表现出良好的稳定性和精度保持能力。

Abstract: Attention scores in transformers are bilinear forms $S_{ij} = x_i^\top M x_j / \sqrt{d_h}$ whose maximum magnitude governs overflow risk in low-precision training. We derive a \emph{rank-aware concentration inequality}: when the interaction matrix $M = W^Q W^{K\top}$ has rank $r \ll d$, tail probabilities for $\max_{i,j}|S_{ij}|$ decay as $\exp(-d^{2}α^{2}/(γr))$ rather than $\exp(-dα^{2})$, where $γ> 1$ is a typicality parameter. For transformer attention where $r = d_h$, this yields $8$--$28\times$ tighter concentration than rank-agnostic bounds in modern architectures. We apply this result to FP8 training, deriving \emph{geometry-aware scale factors} that provide principled overflow guarantees without observing activations. The method computes per-layer scales from the spectral norm $\|W^Q W^{K\top}\|_2$ via implicit power iteration, includes a grouped query attention formulation that avoids key expansion, and remains compatible with fused attention kernels. Across GPT-2 XL to Llama-2-70B, geometry-aware scaling eliminates overflows in transient scenarios where delayed scaling fails, while achieving comparable downstream MMLU accuracy.

Method: 使用机器人操纵任务评估PIC和POIC指标，设置了难度递增的机械臂任务（单杆vs双杆）以及稀疏和稠密奖励的对比，以已知相对复杂度为基准检验这些指标。

Result: 经验结果表明PIC指标与直觉相悖：认为双杆机械臂比单杆更简单；POIC指标认为稀疏奖励任务比稠密奖励更容易；两种指标与RL经验和机器人控制共识存在矛盾。

Conclusion: 基于随机权重猜测的复杂度指标在非表格RL中不可靠，需要开发新的、能更准确捕捉任务复杂度的度量方法，本文的任务框架为此提供了起点。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has enabled major advances in fields such as robotics and natural language processing. A key challenge in RL is measuring task complexity, which is essential for creating meaningful benchmarks and designing effective curricula. While there are numerous well-established metrics for assessing task complexity in tabular settings, relatively few exist in non-tabular domains. These include (i) Statistical analysis of the performance of random policies via Random Weight Guessing (RWG), and (ii) information-theoretic metrics Policy Information Capacity (PIC) and Policy-Optimal Information Capacity (POIC), which are reliant on RWG. In this paper, we evaluate these methods using progressively difficult robotic manipulation setups, with known relative complexity, with both dense and sparse reward formulations. Our empirical results reveal that measuring complexity is still nuanced. Specifically, under the same reward formulation, PIC suggests that a two-link robotic arm setup is easier than a single-link setup - which contradicts the robotic control and empirical RL perspective whereby the two-link setup is inherently more complex. Likewise, for the same setup, POIC estimates that tasks with sparse rewards are easier than those with dense rewards. Thus, we show that both PIC and POIC contradict typical understanding and empirical results from RL. These findings highlight the need to move beyond RWG-based metrics towards better metrics that can more reliably capture task complexity in non-tabular RL with our task framework as a starting point.

Abstract: Hyperbolic spaces provide a natural geometry for representing hierarchical and tree-structured data due to their exponential volume growth. To leverage these benefits, neural networks require intrinsic and efficient components that operate directly in hyperbolic space. In this work, we lift two core components of neural networks, Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) and Fully Connected (FC) layers, into hyperbolic space via Busemann functions, resulting in Busemann MLR (BMLR) and Busemann FC (BFC) layers with a unified mathematical interpretation. BMLR provides compact parameters, a point-to-horosphere distance interpretation, batch-efficient computation, and a Euclidean limit, while BFC generalizes FC and activation layers with comparable complexity. Experiments on image classification, genome sequence learning, node classification, and link prediction demonstrate improvements in effectiveness and efficiency over prior hyperbolic layers.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了结构化预测中基于几何中位数聚合的泛化提升理论，提出了(α,β)-可提升性概念，并证明了在特定稳定性条件下聚合能将弱保证转化为强保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管提升方法在结构化预测中广泛应用，但超越标量损失的聚合理论尚不完整。研究旨在理解在一般散度下向量值和条件密度预测的可提升性，揭示聚合如何将弱保证放大为强保证的理论基础。

Method: 提出了(α,β)-可提升性理论框架，证明了几何中位数聚合对广泛散度类别的可提升性。基于指数重新加权和几何中位数聚合设计了GeoMedBoost统一提升框架，并分析了常见散度（ℓ₁、ℓ₂、TV、Hellinger）下的提升特性。

Result: 研究发现几何中位数聚合能够在广泛散度类别下实现(α,β)-可提升性，揭示了维度依赖和维度无关机制之间的明显区别。虽然KL散度不能直接通过几何中位数聚合提升，但可通过Hellinger距离间接处理。在弱学习器条件和可提升性假设下，获得了经验散度超过误差的指数衰减。

Conclusion: 该研究建立了结构化预测提升的统一几何视角，GeoMedBoost框架能够恢复经典算法如MedBoost、AdaBoost和SAMME作为特例，为结构化预测中的提升聚合提供了理论基础和统一框架。

Abstract: Despite the widespread use of boosting in structured prediction, a general theoretical understanding of aggregation beyond scalar losses remains incomplete. We study vector-valued and conditional density prediction under general divergences and identify stability conditions under which aggregation amplifies weak guarantees into strong ones.
  We formalize this stability property as \emph{$(α,β)$-boostability}. We show that geometric median aggregation achieves $(α,β)$-boostability for a broad class of divergences, with tradeoffs that depend on the underlying geometry. For vector-valued prediction and conditional density estimation, we characterize boostability under common divergences ($\ell_1$, $\ell_2$, $\TV$, and $\Hel$) with geometric median, revealing a sharp distinction between dimension-dependent and dimension-free regimes. We further show that while KL divergence is not directly boostable via geometric median aggregation, it can be handled indirectly through boostability under Hellinger distance.
  Building on these structural results, we propose a generic boosting framework \textsc{GeoMedBoost} based on exponential reweighting and geometric-median aggregation. Under a weak learner condition and $(α,β)$-boostability, we obtain exponential decay of the empirical divergence exceedance error. Our framework recovers classical algorithms such as \textsc{MedBoost}, \textsc{AdaBoost}, and \textsc{SAMME} as special cases, and provides a unified geometric view of boosting for structured prediction.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph(KG) has gained traction as a machine-readable organization of real-world knowledge for analytics using artificial intelligence systems. Graph Neural Network(GNN), is proven to be an effective KG embedding technique that enables various downstream tasks like link prediction, node classification, and graph classification. The focus of research in both KG embedding and GNNs has been mostly oriented towards simple graphs with binary relations. However, real-world knowledge bases have a significant share of complex and n-ary facts that cannot be represented by binary edges. More specifically, real-world knowledge bases are often a mix of two types of n-ary facts - (i) that require hyperedges and (ii) that require hyper-relational edges. Though there are research efforts catering to these n-ary fact types, they are pursued independently for each type. We propose $H$yper$E$dge $H$yper-$R$elational edge $GNN$(HEHRGNN), a unified embedding model for n-ary relational KGs with both hyperedges and hyper-relational edges. The two main components of the model are i)HEHR unified fact representation format, and ii)HEHRGNN encoder, a GNN-based encoder with a novel message propagation model capable of capturing complex graph structures comprising both hyperedges and hyper-relational edges. The experimental results of HEHRGNN on link prediction tasks show its effectiveness as a unified embedding model, with inductive prediction capability, for link prediction across real-world datasets having different types of n-ary facts. The model also shows improved link prediction performance over baseline models for hyperedge and hyper-relational datasets.

Abstract: Vector-quantized autoencoders deliver high-fidelity latents but suffer inherent flaws: the quantizer is non-differentiable, requires straight-through hacks, and is prone to collapse. We address these issues at the root by replacing VQ with a simple, principled, and fully differentiable alternative: an online PCA bottleneck trained via Oja's rule. The resulting model, PCA-VAE, learns an orthogonal, variance-ordered latent basis without codebooks, commitment losses, or lookup noise. Despite its simplicity, PCA-VAE exceeds VQ-GAN and SimVQ in reconstruction quality on CelebAHQ while using 10-100x fewer latent bits. It also produces naturally interpretable dimensions (e.g., pose, lighting, gender cues) without adversarial regularization or disentanglement objectives. These results suggest that PCA is a viable replacement for VQ: mathematically grounded, stable, bit-efficient, and semantically structured, offering a new direction for generative models beyond vector quantization.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, yet their decision-making processes remain difficult to interpret. Existing explanation methods often lack trustworthy structural insight and are limited to single-instance analysis, failing to reveal reasoning stability and systematic failure mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose the Trustworthy Unified Explanation Framework (TRUE), which integrates executable reasoning verification, feasible-region directed acyclic graph (DAG) modeling, and causal failure mode analysis. At the instance level, we redefine reasoning traces as executable process specifications and introduce blind execution verification to assess operational validity. At the local structural level, we construct feasible-region DAGs via structure-consistent perturbations, enabling explicit characterization of reasoning stability and the executable region in the local input space. At the class level, we introduce a causal failure mode analysis method that identifies recurring structural failure patterns and quantifies their causal influence using Shapley values. Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework provides multi-level, verifiable explanations, including executable reasoning structures for individual instances, feasible-region representations for neighboring inputs, and interpretable failure modes with quantified importance at the class level. These results establish a unified and principled paradigm for improving the interpretability and reliability of LLM reasoning systems.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent generative recommendation frameworks have demonstrated remarkable scaling potential by reformulating item prediction as autoregressive Semantic ID (SID) generation. However, existing methods primarily rely on shallow behavioral signals, encoding items solely through surface-level textual features such as titles and descriptions. This reliance results in a critical Shallow Interest problem: the model fails to capture the latent, semantically rich interests underlying user interactions, limiting both personalization depth and recommendation interpretability. DeepInterestGR introduces three key innovations: (1) Multi-LLM Interest Mining (MLIM): We leverage multiple frontier LLMs along with their multi-modal variants to extract deep textual and visual interest representations through Chain-of-Thought prompting. (2) Reward-Labeled Deep Interest (RLDI): We employ a lightweight binary classifier to assign reward labels to mined interests, enabling effective supervision signals for reinforcement learning. (3) Interest-Enhanced Item Discretization (IEID): The curated deep interests are encoded into semantic embeddings and quantized into SID tokens via RQ-VAE. We adopt a two-stage training pipeline: supervised fine-tuning aligns the generative model with deep interest signals and collaborative filtering patterns, followed by reinforcement learning with GRPO optimized by our Interest-Aware Reward. Experiments on three Amazon Review benchmarks demonstrate that DeepInterestGR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across HR@K and NDCG@K metrics.

Abstract: Density-adaptive domain discretization is essential for high-utility privacy-preserving analytics but remains challenging under Local Differential Privacy (LDP) due to the privacy-budget costs associated with iterative refinement. We propose a novel framework, Semi-Local Differential Privacy (SLDP), that assigns a privacy region to each user based on local density and defines adjacency by the potential movement of a point within its privacy region. We present an interactive $(\varepsilon, δ)$-SLDP protocol, orchestrated by an honest-but-curious server over a public channel, to estimate these regions privately. Crucially, our framework decouples the privacy cost from the number of refinement iterations, allowing for high-resolution grids without additional privacy budget cost. We experimentally demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on estimation tasks across synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Comparing AI models to "human level" is often misleading when benchmark scores are incommensurate or human baselines are drawn from a narrow population. To address this, we propose a framework that calibrates items against the 'world population' and report performance on a common, human-anchored scale. Concretely, we build on a set of multi-level scales for different capabilities where each level should represent a probability of success of the whole world population on a logarithmic scale with a base $B$. We calibrate each scale for each capability (reasoning, comprehension, knowledge, volume, etc.) by compiling publicly released human test data spanning education and reasoning benchmarks (PISA, TIMSS, ICAR, UKBioBank, and ReliabilityBench). The base $B$ is estimated by extrapolating between samples with two demographic profiles using LLMs, with the hypothesis that they condense rich information about human populations. We evaluate the quality of different mappings using group slicing and post-stratification. The new techniques allow for the recalibration and standardization of scales relative to the whole-world population.

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) threaten the privacy of machine learning models by revealing whether a specific data point was used during training. Existing MIAs often rely on impractical assumptions such as access to public datasets, shadow models, confidence scores, or training data distribution knowledge and making them vulnerable to defenses like confidence masking and adversarial regularization. Label-only MIAs, even under strict constraints suffer from high query requirements per sample. We propose a cost-effective label-only MIA framework based on transferability and model extraction. By querying the target model M using active sampling, perturbation-based selection, and synthetic data, we extract a functionally similar surrogate S on which membership inference is performed. This shifts query overhead to a one-time extraction phase, eliminating repeated queries to M . Operating under strict black-box constraints, our method matches the performance of state-of-the-art label-only MIAs while significantly reducing query costs. On benchmarks including Purchase, Location, and Texas Hospital, we show that a query budget equivalent to testing $\approx1\%$ of training samples suffices to extract S and achieve membership inference accuracy within $\pm1\%$ of M . We also evaluate the effectiveness of standard defenses proposed for label-only MIAs against our attack.

Abstract: Gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent are central to modern machine learning, yet their behavior under large step sizes remains theoretically unclear. Recent work suggests that acceleration often arises near the edge of stability, where optimization trajectories become unstable and difficult to analyze. Existing results for separable logistic regression achieve faster convergence by explicitly leveraging such unstable regimes through constant or adaptive large step sizes. In this paper, we show that instability is not inherent to acceleration. We prove that gradient descent with a simple, non-adaptive increasing step-size schedule achieves exponential convergence for separable logistic regression under a margin condition, while remaining entirely within a stable optimization regime. The resulting method is anytime and does not require prior knowledge of the optimization horizon or target accuracy. We also establish exponential convergence of stochastic gradient descent using a lightweight adaptive step-size rule that avoids line search and specialized procedures, improving upon existing polynomial-rate guarantees. Together, our results demonstrate that carefully structured step-size growth alone suffices to obtain exponential acceleration for both gradient descent and stochastic gradient descent.

Abstract: Transformer models contain substantial internal redundancy arising from coordinate-dependent representations and continuous symmetries, in model space and in head space, respectively. While recent approaches address this by explicitly breaking symmetry, we propose a complementary framework based on symmetry reduction. We reformulate representations, attention mechanisms, and optimization dynamics in terms of invariant relational quantities, eliminating redundant degrees of freedom by construction. This perspective yields architectures that operate directly on relational structures, providing a principled geometric framework for reducing parameter redundancy and analyzing optimization.

Abstract: Neural Processes (NPs), and specifically Transformer Neural Processes (TNPs), have demonstrated remarkable performance across tasks ranging from spatiotemporal forecasting to tabular data modelling. However, many of these applications are inherently sequential, involving continuous data streams such as real-time sensor readings or database updates. In such settings, models should support cheap, incremental updates rather than recomputing internal representations from scratch for every new observation -- a capability existing TNP variants lack. Drawing inspiration from Large Language Models, we introduce the Incremental TNP (incTNP). By leveraging causal masking, Key-Value (KV) caching, and a data-efficient autoregressive training strategy, incTNP matches the predictive performance of standard TNPs while reducing the computational cost of updates from quadratic to linear time complexity. We empirically evaluate our model on a range of synthetic and real-world tasks, including tabular regression and temperature prediction. Our results show that, surprisingly, incTNP delivers performance comparable to -- or better than -- non-causal TNPs while unlocking orders-of-magnitude speedups for sequential inference. Finally, we assess the consistency of the model's updates -- by adapting a metric of ``implicit Bayesianness", we show that incTNP retains a prediction rule as implicitly Bayesian as standard non-causal TNPs, demonstrating that incTNP achieves the computational benefits of causal masking without sacrificing the consistency required for streaming inference.

Abstract: Common deep learning approaches for antibody engineering focus on modeling the marginal distribution of sequences. By treating sequences as independent samples, however, these methods overlook affinity maturation as a rich and largely untapped source of information about the evolutionary process by which antibodies explore the underlying fitness landscape. In contrast, classical phylogenetic models explicitly represent evolutionary dynamics but lack the expressivity to capture complex epistatic interactions. We bridge this gap with CoSiNE, a continuous-time Markov chain parameterized by a deep neural network. Mathematically, we prove that CoSiNE provides a first-order approximation to the intractable sequential point mutation process, capturing epistatic effects with an error bound that is quadratic in branch length. Empirically, CoSiNE outperforms state-of-the-art language models in zero-shot variant effect prediction by explicitly disentangling selection from context-dependent somatic hypermutation. Finally, we introduce Guided Gillespie, a classifier-guided sampling scheme that steers CoSiNE at inference time, enabling efficient optimization of antibody binding affinity toward specific antigens.

Abstract: Theoretical analyses of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) are standardly framed within the Real-RAM model of computation. In this setting, training even simple neural networks is known to be $\exists \mathbb{R}$-complete -- a complexity class believed to be harder than NP, that characterizes the difficulty of solving systems of polynomial inequalities over the real numbers. However, this algebraic framework diverges from the reality of digital computation with finite-precision hardware. In this work, we analyze the theoretical complexity of ERM under a realistic bit-level model ($\mathsf{ERM}_{\text{bit}}$), where network parameters and inputs are constrained to be rational numbers with polynomially bounded bit-lengths. Under this model, we reveal a sharp dichotomy in tractability governed by the network's activation function. We prove that for deep networks with {\em any} polynomial activations with rational coefficients and degree at least $2$, the bit-complexity of training is severe: deciding $\mathsf{ERM}_{\text{bit}}$ is $\#P$-Hard, hence believed to be strictly harder than NP-complete problems. Furthermore, we show that determining the sign of a single partial derivative of the empirical loss function is intractable (unlikely in BPP), and deciding a specific bit in the gradient is $\#P$-Hard. This provides a complexity-theoretic perspective for the phenomenon of exploding and vanishing gradients. In contrast, we show that for piecewise-linear activations such as ReLU, the precision requirements remain manageable: $\mathsf{ERM}_{\text{bit}}$ is contained within NP (specifically NP-complete), and standard backpropagation runs in polynomial time. Our results demonstrate that finite-precision constraints are not merely implementation details but fundamental determinants of learnability.

Abstract: Detecting LLM training data is generally framed as a membership inference attack (MIA) problem. However, conventional MIAs operate passively on fixed model weights, using log-likelihoods or text generations. In this work, we introduce \textbf{Active Data Reconstruction Attack} (ADRA), a family of MIA that actively induces a model to reconstruct a given text through training. We hypothesize that training data are \textit{more reconstructible} than non-members, and the difference in their reconstructibility can be exploited for membership inference. Motivated by findings that reinforcement learning (RL) sharpens behaviors already encoded in weights, we leverage on-policy RL to actively elicit data reconstruction by finetuning a policy initialized from the target model. To effectively use RL for MIA, we design reconstruction metrics and contrastive rewards. The resulting algorithms, \textsc{ADRA} and its adaptive variant \textsc{ADRA+}, improve both reconstruction and detection given a pool of candidate data. Experiments show that our methods consistently outperform existing MIAs in detecting pre-training, post-training, and distillation data, with an average improvement of 10.7\% over the previous runner-up. In particular, \MethodPlus~improves over Min-K\%++ by 18.8\% on BookMIA for pre-training detection and by 7.6\% on AIME for post-training detection.

Abstract: Inverse lithography (ILT) is critical for modern semiconductor manufacturing but suffers from highly non-convex objectives that often trap optimization in poor local minima. Generative AI has been explored to warm-start ILT, yet most approaches train deterministic image-to-image translators to mimic sub-optimal datasets, providing limited guidance for escaping non-convex traps during refinement. We reformulate mask synthesis as conditional sampling: a generator learns a distribution over masks conditioned on the design and proposes multiple candidates. The generator is first pretrained with WGAN plus a reconstruction loss, then fine-tuned using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with an ILT-guided imitation loss. At inference, we sample a small batch of masks, run fast batched ILT refinement, evaluate lithography metrics (e.g., EPE, process window), and select the best candidate. On \texttt{LithoBench} dataset, the proposed hybrid framework reduces EPE violations under a 3\,nm tolerance and roughly doubles throughput versus a strong numerical ILT baseline, while improving final mask quality. We also present over 20\% EPE improvement on \texttt{ICCAD13} contest cases with 3$\times$ speedup over the SOTA numerical ILT solver. By learning to propose ILT-friendly initializations, our approach mitigates non-convexity and advances beyond what traditional solvers or GenAI can achieve.

Abstract: A recurring challenge in preference fine-tuning (PFT) is handling $\textit{intransitive}$ (i.e., cyclic) preferences. Intransitive preferences often stem from either $\textit{(i)}$ inconsistent rankings along a single objective or $\textit{(ii)}$ scalarizing multiple objectives into a single metric. Regardless of their source, the downstream implication of intransitive preferences is the same: there is no well-defined optimal policy, breaking a core assumption of the standard PFT pipeline. In response, we propose a novel, game-theoretic solution concept -- the $\textit{Maximum Entropy Blackwell Winner}$ ($\textit{MaxEntBW}$) -- that is well-defined under multi-objective intransitive preferences. To enable computing MaxEntBWs at scale, we derive $\texttt{PROSPER}$: a provably efficient PFT algorithm. Unlike prior self-play techniques, $\texttt{PROSPER}$ directly handles multiple objectives without requiring scalarization. We then apply $\texttt{PROSPER}$ to the problem of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) from multi-objective LLM-as-a-Judge feedback (e.g., rubric-based judges), a setting where both sources of intransitivity arise. We find that $\texttt{PROSPER}$ outperforms all baselines considered across both instruction following and general chat benchmarks, releasing trained model checkpoints at the 7B and 3B parameter scales.

Abstract: Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) have recently achieved strong results in text generation. However, their multi-step sampling leads to slow inference, limiting practical use. To address this, we extend Inverse Distillation, a technique originally developed to accelerate continuous diffusion models, to the discrete setting. Nonetheless, this extension introduces both theoretical and practical challenges. From a theoretical perspective, the inverse distillation objective lacks uniqueness guarantees, which may lead to suboptimal solutions. From a practical standpoint, backpropagation in the discrete space is non-trivial and often unstable. To overcome these challenges, we first provide a theoretical result demonstrating that our inverse formulation admits a unique solution, thereby ensuring valid optimization. We then introduce gradient-stable relaxations to support effective training. As a result, experiments on multiple DLMs show that our method, Inverse-distilled Diffusion Language Models (IDLM), reduces the number of inference steps by 4x-64x, while preserving the teacher model's entropy and generative perplexity.

Abstract: Current time series foundation models (TSFMs) primarily focus on learning prevalent and regular patterns within a predefined time or frequency domain to enable supervised downstream tasks (e.g., forecasting). Consequently, they are often ineffective for inherently unsupervised downstream tasks-such as time series anomaly detection (TSAD), which aims to identify rare, irregular patterns. This limitation arises because such abnormal patterns can closely resemble the regular patterns when presented in the same time/frequency domain. To address this issue, we introduce TimeRadar, an innovative TSFM built in a fractional time-frequency domain to support generalist TSAD across diverse unseen datasets. Our key insight is that rotating a time series into a data-dependent fractional time-frequency representation can adaptively differentiate the normal and abnormal signals across different datasets. To this end, a novel component, namely Fractionally modulated Time-Frequency Reconstruction (FTFRecon), is proposed in TimeRadar to leverage a learnable fractional order to rotate the time series to the most pronounced angle between a continuous time and frequency domain for accurate data reconstruction. This provides adaptive data reconstruction in an optimal time-frequency domain for each data input, enabling effective differentiation of the unbounded abnormal patterns from the regular ones across datasets, including unseen datasets. To allow TimeRadar to model local abnormality that is not captured by the global data reconstruction, we further introduce a Contextual Deviation Learning (CDL) component to model the local deviation of the input relative to its contextual time series data in the rotatable domain.

Abstract: Integral operators play a central role in signal processing, underpinning classical convolution, and filtering on continuous network models such as graphons. While these operators are traditionally analyzed through spectral decompositions, their connection to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) has not been systematically explored within the algebraic signal processing framework. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive theory showing that the range of integral operators naturally induces RKHS convolutional signal models whose reproducing kernels are determined by a box product of the operator symbols. We characterize the algebraic and spectral properties of these induced RKHS and show that polynomial filtering with integral operators corresponds to iterated box products, giving rise to a unital kernel algebra. This perspective yields pointwise RKHS representations of filters via the reproducing property, providing an alternative to operator-based implementations. Our results establish precise connections between eigendecompositions and RKHS representations in graphon signal processing, extend naturally to directed graphons, and enable novel spatial--spectral localization results. Furthermore, we show that when the spectral domain is a subset of the original domain of the signals, optimal filters for regularized learning problems admit finite-dimensional RKHS representations, providing a principled foundation for learnable filters in integral-operator-based neural architectures.

Result: 在真实世界时空数据集上的广泛实验表明，ST-Prune显著加速了训练速度，同时保持甚至提高了模型性能，还展现了良好的可扩展性和普适性

Conclusion: 研究证明通过关注训练数据效率而非仅优化模型架构，可以有效解决时空预测中的计算瓶颈问题，ST-Prune为提升深度学习模型训练效率提供了新的方向

Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting is fundamental to intelligent systems in transportation, climate science, and urban planning. However, training deep learning models on the massive, often redundant, datasets from these domains presents a significant computational bottleneck. Existing solutions typically focus on optimizing model architectures or optimizers, while overlooking the inherent inefficiency of the training data itself. This conventional approach of iterating over the entire static dataset each epoch wastes considerable resources on easy-to-learn or repetitive samples. In this paper, we explore a novel training-efficiency techniques, namely learning from complexity with dynamic sample pruning, ST-Prune, for spatio-temporal forecasting. Through dynamic sample pruning, we aim to intelligently identify the most informative samples based on the model's real-time learning state, thereby accelerating convergence and improving training efficiency. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world spatio-temporal datasets show that ST-Prune significantly accelerates the training speed while maintaining or even improving the model performance, and it also has scalability and universality.

TL;DR: 提出一种鲁棒的贝叶斯随机特征回归框架，通过Huber式污染集来显式处理先验和似然的误设定问题，提供可计算的预测不确定性界限和稳健性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统贝叶斯随机特征回归通常假设高斯先验和似然，但现实应用中存在先验误设定和似然污染问题，需要建立能够抵御误设定的稳健推断框架。

Method: 将经典岭正则化随机特征训练与贝叶斯推断的等价关系推广到污染集合：用ε-污染的credal集代替单点先验，η-污染的credal集代替似然，采用悲观广义贝叶斯更新进行推断。推导后验预测密度的显式可计算界限，并提出不精确最高密度区域(IHDR)用于稳健预测不确定性量化。

Result: 当污染程度适中时，先验和似然的不确定性直接转化为后验预测分布的污染，在经典高斯预测周围形成不确定性包络线。IHDR可通过调整的高斯置信区间高效外逼近。预测方差界限保持了随机特征模型已知的比例增长渐近性质。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯随机特征的稳健性理论得到建立：预测不确定性保持计算可处理性，继承经典双下降相位结构，并在有界先验和似然误设定下具有明确的最坏情况保证。

Abstract: We propose a robust Bayesian formulation of random feature (RF) regression that accounts explicitly for prior and likelihood misspecification via Huber-style contamination sets. Starting from the classical equivalence between ridge-regularized RF training and Bayesian inference with Gaussian priors and likelihoods, we replace the single prior and likelihood with $ε$- and $η$-contaminated credal sets, respectively, and perform inference using pessimistic generalized Bayesian updating. We derive explicit and tractable bounds for the resulting lower and upper posterior predictive densities. These bounds show that, when contamination is moderate, prior and likelihood ambiguity effectively acts as a direct contamination of the posterior predictive distribution, yielding uncertainty envelopes around the classical Gaussian predictive. We introduce an Imprecise Highest Density Region (IHDR) for robust predictive uncertainty quantification and show that it admits an efficient outer approximation via an adjusted Gaussian credible interval. We further obtain predictive variance bounds (under a mild truncation approximation for the upper bound) and prove that they preserve the leading-order proportional-growth asymptotics known for RF models. Together, these results establish a robustness theory for Bayesian random features: predictive uncertainty remains computationally tractable, inherits the classical double-descent phase structure, and is improved by explicit worst-case guarantees under bounded prior and likelihood misspecification.

Motivation: 数据收集中的资源限制或无意识偏差会导致标注偏差，即不同子组的标签错误率不均或子组比例失真。现有公平性约束通常假设训练标签反映真实分布，在标注偏差存在时失效，因此需要检测标注偏差的方法

Method: 使用影响函数估计每个训练样本对模型预测的影响，通过损失函数的梯度和海森矩阵识别错误标注样本。开发样本评估流程，先在MNIST数据集测试，后扩展到更复杂的CheXpert医学影像数据集。通过翻转20%某类标签引入可控错误，使用对角海森矩阵近似

Result: 在MNIST上成功检测近90%的错误标注样本；在CheXpert上，错误标注样本始终显示更高的影响分数

Conclusion: 影响函数在识别标签错误方面显示出潜力，可作为检测标注偏差的有效工具

Abstract: Labeling bias arises during data collection due to resource limitations or unconscious bias, leading to unequal label error rates across subgroups or misrepresentation of subgroup prevalence. Most fairness constraints assume training labels reflect the true distribution, rendering them ineffective when labeling bias is present; leaving a challenging question, that \textit{how can we detect such labeling bias?} In this work, we investigate whether influence functions can be used to detect labeling bias. Influence functions estimate how much each training sample affects a model's predictions by leveraging the gradient and Hessian of the loss function -- when labeling errors occur, influence functions can identify wrongly labeled samples in the training set, revealing the underlying failure mode. We develop a sample valuation pipeline and test it first on the MNIST dataset, then scaled to the more complex CheXpert medical imaging dataset. To examine label noise, we introduced controlled errors by flipping 20\% of the labels for one class in the dataset. Using a diagonal Hessian approximation, we demonstrated promising results, successfully detecting nearly 90\% of mislabeled samples in MNIST. On CheXpert, mislabeled samples consistently exhibit higher influence scores. These results highlight the potential of influence functions for identifying label errors.

Abstract: Supervised causal learning has shown promise in causal discovery, yet it often struggles with generalization across diverse interventional settings, particularly when intervention targets are unknown. To address this, we propose TICL (Test-time Interventional Causal Learning), a novel method that synergizes Test-Time Training with Joint Causal Inference. Specifically, we design a self-augmentation strategy to generate instance-specific training data at test time, effectively avoiding distribution shifts. Furthermore, by integrating joint causal inference, we developed a PC-inspired two-phase supervised learning scheme, which effectively leverages self-augmented training data while ensuring theoretical identifiability. Extensive experiments on bnlearn benchmarks demonstrate TICL's superiority in multiple aspects of causal discovery and intervention target detection.

Motivation: 传统手工设计的优化器（如Adam）存在局限，而现有学习型优化器（如VeLO）需要巨大计算成本（4000 TPU月）且难以推广到大参数规模（超过6亿参数）。研究者希望找到一种高效、可扩展的学习型优化器方案。

Method: 设计了简单的归一化优化器架构，并增强了元训练过程，在极低计算成本（4.5 GPU小时）下训练通用学习型更新规则。该方法兼容现代优化框架，包括正交化、输入输出与隐藏权重的不同更新规则，以及解耦权重衰减。

Result: 学习型优化器能稳定扩展到十亿参数规模的GPT-3 XL 1.3B预训练任务，这比其元训练分布大六个数量级。在多种分布外任务中表现优异，计算成本仅为VeLO的极小部分。

Conclusion: 这项工作为实用学习型优化算法铺平了道路，解锁了更丰富的元训练和数据管理方法的探索，有望进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Learned optimizers are powerful alternatives to hand-designed update rules like Adam, yet they have seen limited practical adoption since they often fail to meta-generalize beyond their training distribution and incur high meta-training cost. For instance, prior work, VeLO, scaled meta-training to 4,000 TPU months ($\sim$10$\times$ GPT-3 compute) to meta-train a general-purpose optimizer but it failed to generalize beyond 600M parameters tasks. In this work, we present a surprising finding: by crafting a simple normalized optimizer architecture and augmenting meta-training, it becomes feasible to meta-train a performant general-purpose learned update rule on a tiny fraction of VeLO compute, 4.5 GPU hours to be precise. Our learned update rule scales stably to a billion-scale pretraining task (GPT-3 XL 1.3B) which is six orders of magnitude larger than its meta-training distribution. Furthermore, it shows strong performance across diverse out-of-distribution tasks and is compatible with modern optimization harness that includes orthogonalization, distinct update rules for input-output and hidden weights, and decoupled weight decay. In all, this work paves the way for practically applicable learnable optimization algorithms, unlocking exploration of richer meta-training and data curation recipes to further improve performance.

Abstract: This paper introduces a high-order Markov chain task to investigate how transformers learn to integrate information from multiple past positions with varying statistical significance. We demonstrate that transformers learn this task incrementally: each stage is defined by the acquisition of specific information through sparse attention patterns. Notably, we identify a shift in learning dynamics from competitive, where heads converge on the most statistically dominant pattern, to cooperative, where heads specialize in distinct patterns. We model these dynamics using simplified differential equations that characterize the trajectory and prove stage-wise convergence results. Our analysis reveals that transformers ascend a complexity ladder by passing through simpler, misspecified hypothesis classes before reaching the full model class. We further show that early stopping acts as an implicit regularizer, biasing the model toward these simpler classes. These results provide a theoretical foundation for the emergence of staged learning and complex behaviors in transformers, offering insights into generalization for natural language processing and algorithmic reasoning.

Conclusion: VPS作为一种推理时自适应技术，通过动态低秩扰动实现了对冻结Transformer层的激活条件化增强，为提升大语言模型推理能力提供了新的方法路径。

Abstract: I introduce Virtual Parameter Sharpening (VPS), an inference-time technique that augments frozen transformer linear layers with dynamic, activation-conditioned low-rank perturbations. Unlike parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA, which learn static low-rank adapters, VPS constructs its perturbation factors on the fly from batch activation statistics and optional gradient signals, enabling test-time adaptation without persistent parameter updates. The perturbation takes the form Delta W = gamma * W^T V U^T W, where selector matrices U and V are constructed via sparse activation-guided selection or Sylvester-coupled regression. We provide a theoretical analysis of the perturbation's spectral properties and describe an adaptive policy system that modulates perturbation magnitude based on activation energy and token-level entropy. This system incorporates multi-objective verification with iterative refinement for tasks with ground-truth supervision. We present the complete algorithmic framework, analyze its mathematical foundations, and discuss the mechanisms by which activation-conditioned computation may enhance reasoning capabilities in large language models.

Abstract: Realizable online regression can behave very differently from online classification. Even without any margin or stochastic assumptions, realizability may enforce horizon-free (finite) cumulative loss under metric-like losses, even when the analogous classification problem has an infinite mistake bound. We study realizable online regression in the adversarial model under losses that satisfy an approximate triangle inequality (approximate pseudo-metrics). Recent work of Attias et al. shows that the minimax realizable cumulative loss is characterized by the scaled Littlestone/online dimension $\mathbb{D}_{\mathrm{onl}}$, but this quantity can be difficult to analyze.
  Our main contribution is a generic potential method that upper bounds $\mathbb{D}_{\mathrm{onl}}$ by a concrete Dudley-type entropy integral that depends only on covering numbers of the hypothesis class under the induced sup pseudo-metric. We define an \emph{entropy potential} $Φ(\mathcal{H})=\int_{0}^{diam(\mathcal{H})} \log N(\mathcal{H},\varepsilon)\,d\varepsilon$, where $N(\mathcal{H},\varepsilon)$ is the $\varepsilon$-covering number of $\mathcal{H}$, and show that for every $c$-approximate pseudo-metric loss, $\mathbb{D}_{\mathrm{onl}}(\mathcal{H})\le O(c)\,Φ(\mathcal{H})$. In particular, polynomial metric entropy implies $Φ(\mathcal{H})<\infty$ and hence a horizon-free realizable cumulative-loss bound with transparent dependence on effective dimension.
  We illustrate the method on two families. We prove a sharp $q$-vs.-$d$ dichotomy for realizable online learning (finite and efficiently achievable $Θ_{d,q}(L^d)$ total loss for $L$-Lipschitz regression iff $q>d$, otherwise infinite), and for bounded-norm $k$-ReLU networks separate regression (finite loss, even $\widetilde O(k^2)$, and $O(1)$ for one ReLU) from classification (impossible already for $k=2,d=1$).

Conclusion: 该HybridFL架构能够有效实现既能处理水平数据分布又能处理垂直分布的混合场景，并在保护隐私的情况下，实现与集中式学习相当的性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that enables multiple parties to collaboratively train models on privately owned data without sharing raw information. While standard FL typically addresses either horizontal or vertical data partitions, many real-world scenarios exhibit a complex hybrid distribution. This paper proposes Hybrid Federated Learning (HybridFL) to address data split both horizontally across disjoint users and vertically across complementary feature sets. We evaluate HybridFL in a financial crime detection context, where a transaction party holds transaction-level attributes and multiple banks maintain private account-level features. By integrating horizontal aggregation and vertical feature fusion, the proposed architecture enables joint learning while strictly preserving data locality. Experiments on AMLSim and SWIFT datasets demonstrate that HybridFL significantly outperforms the transaction-only local model and achieves performance comparable to a centralized benchmark.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has proven effective for Large Language Model (LLM) reasoning, yet current methods face key challenges in resource allocation and policy optimization dynamics: (i) uniform rollout allocation ignores gradient variance heterogeneity across problems, and (ii) the softmax policy structure causes gradient attenuation for high-confidence correct actions, while excessive gradient updates may destabilize training. Therefore, we propose DynaMO, a theoretically-grounded dual-pronged optimization framework. At the sequence level, we prove that uniform allocation is suboptimal and derive variance-minimizing allocation from the first principle, establishing Bernoulli variance as a computable proxy for gradient informativeness. At the token level, we develop gradient-aware advantage modulation grounded in theoretical analysis of gradient magnitude bounds. Our framework compensates for gradient attenuation of high-confidence correct actions while utilizing entropy changes as computable indicators to stabilize excessive update magnitudes. Extensive experiments conducted on a diverse range of mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong RLVR baselines.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业希望使用表格基础模型实现免训练机器学习，但缺乏独立评估。本文旨在从实践者角度评估SAP的RPT-1模型在真实业务场景中的表现，为其实际应用提供依据。

Method: 在SAP三个业务场景（需求预测、数据完整性预测、财务风险分类）中，使用五折交叉验证对比RPT-1（无训练样例）与调优梯度提升树（XGBoost、LightGBM、CatBoost）的性能。数据集规模2500-3200行，并分析了不同数据量下的性能变化。

Result: RPT-1达到调优GBDT准确率的91-96%，分类任务AUC-ROC差距3.6-4.1个百分点，回归任务R平方差距8.9-11.1个百分点。有趣发现：当上下文行数约75-100时，RPT-1表现优于XGBoost。

Conclusion: 提出实用混合工作流：先用RPT-1快速筛选，再在预测精度值得投入时选择性训练GBDT。所有实验通过Hugging Face Spaces可复现。

Abstract: Tabular foundation models aim to make machine learning accessible for enterprise data without task-specific training. This paper presents the first independent evaluation of SAP's Retrieval Pretrained Transformer (RPT-1) from a practitioner perspective. RPT-1 is a compact 64.6 MB model pretrained on 1.34 TB of structured data across 3.1 million tables. We benchmark it against tuned gradient-boosted decision trees (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) on three SAP business scenarios: demand forecasting across SD/MM/PP modules, predictive data integrity in BC/MM/QM, and financial risk classification in FI/CO/AR. Across five-fold cross-validation on datasets ranging from 2,500 to 3,200 rows, RPT-1 reaches 91-96% of tuned GBDT accuracy without any training examples. The classification gap is modest at 3.6-4.1 percentage points on AUC-ROC, though regression tasks show wider gaps of 8.9-11.1 percentage points on R-squared. An interesting finding is a crossover at roughly 75-100 context rows where RPT-1 actually outperforms XGBoost under limited data. Based on these results, we propose a practical hybrid workflow: use RPT-1 for rapid screening, then train GBDT selectively where prediction accuracy justifies the effort. All experiments are reproducible through publicly available Hugging Face Spaces.

Conclusion: X-ANFIS为模糊系统在可解释AI中的应用提供了一种有效的交替梯度优化方法，突破了现有方法在准确性与可解释性权衡上的限制。

Abstract: Fuzzy systems show strong potential in explainable AI due to their rule-based architecture and linguistic variables. Existing approaches navigate the accuracy-explainability trade-off either through evolutionary multi-objective optimization (MOO), which is computationally expensive, or gradient-based scalarization, which cannot recover non-convex Pareto regions. We propose X-ANFIS, an alternating bi-objective gradient-based optimization scheme for explainable adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference systems. Cauchy membership functions are used for stable training under semantically controlled initializations, and a differentiable explainability objective is introduced and decoupled from the performance objective through alternating gradient passes. Validated in approximately 5,000 experiments on nine UCI regression datasets, X-ANFIS consistently achieves target distinguishability while maintaining competitive predictive accuracy, recovering solutions beyond the convex hull of the MOO Pareto front.

Result: 在NAS-Bench-101和NAS-Bench-201上：1) 匹配NAS-Bench-201所有三个任务的最优性能(91.61%、73.49%、46.77%)；2) 仅在7%搜索空间上预训练后，微调生成的架构接近完全数据模型性能(相差仅0.32个百分点)，且超越其训练上限7.3个百分点；3) 双向控制实验确认真正的奖励驱动控制，逆向优化接近随机准确率(9.5%)

Conclusion: 强化学习引导的离散扩散方法经过扩展以处理方向性后，为有向组合结构提供了可控的生成框架

Abstract: Reinforcement learning fine-tuning has proven effective for steering generative diffusion models toward desired properties in image and molecular domains. Graph diffusion models have similarly been applied to combinatorial structure generation, including neural architecture search (NAS). However, neural architectures are directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) where edge direction encodes functional semantics such as data flow-information that existing graph diffusion methods, designed for undirected structures, discard. We propose Directed Graph Policy Optimization (DGPO), which extends reinforcement learning fine-tuning of discrete graph diffusion models to DAGs via topological node ordering and positional encoding. Validated on NAS-Bench-101 and NAS-Bench-201, DGPO matches the benchmark optimum on all three NAS-Bench-201 tasks (91.61%, 73.49%, 46.77%). The central finding is that the model learns transferable structural priors: pretrained on only 7% of the search space, it generates near-oracle architectures after fine-tuning, within 0.32 percentage points of the full-data model and extrapolating 7.3 percentage points beyond its training ceiling. Bidirectional control experiments confirm genuine reward-driven steering, with inverse optimization reaching near random-chance accuracy (9.5%). These results demonstrate that reinforcement learning-steered discrete diffusion, once extended to handle directionality, provides a controllable generative framework for directed combinatorial structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦二阶优化在非IID数据上不稳定甚至发散，主要原因是预条件器漂移导致客户端和服务端在不相容的度量下更新，破坏全局下降方向

Method: FedPAC框架：1)对齐-聚合本地预条件器为全局参考并用全局预条件器预热客户端；2)校正-使用全局预条件方向引导本地更新以抑制长期漂移

Result: 理论上提供非凸收敛保证，实验证明在视觉和语言任务中显著提升稳定性和精度，在CIFAR-100上获得5.8%绝对精度提升

Conclusion: FedPAC通过解耦参数聚合与几何同步，有效解决联邦二阶优化的预条件器漂移问题，为大规模联邦学习提供可靠的二阶训练方案

Abstract: Second-order optimizers can significantly accelerate large-scale training, yet their naive federated variants are often unstable or even diverge on non-IID data.
  We show that a key culprit is \emph{preconditioner drift}: client-side second-order training induces heterogeneous \emph{curvature-defined geometries} (i.e., preconditioner coordinate systems), and server-side model averaging updates computed under incompatible metrics, corrupting the global descent direction.
  To address this geometric mismatch, we propose \texttt{FedPAC}, a \emph{preconditioner alignment and correction} framework for reliable federated second-order optimization.
  \texttt{FedPAC} explicitly decouples parameter aggregation from geometry synchronization by:
  (i) \textbf{Alignment} (i.e.,aggregating local preconditioners into a global reference and warm-starting clients via global preconditioner); and
  (ii) \textbf{Correction} (i.e., steering local preconditioned updates using a global preconditioned direction to suppress long-term drift).
  We provide drift-coupled non-convex convergence guarantees with linear speedup under partial participation.
  Empirically, \texttt{FedPAC} consistently improves stability and accuracy across vision and language tasks, achieving up to $5.8\%$ absolute accuracy gain on CIFAR-100 with ViTs.

Abstract: A significant portion of recent research on Large Language Model (LLM) alignment focuses on developing new policy optimization methods based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Two prominent directions have emerged: (i) a shift toward sequence-level importance sampling weights that better align with the sequence-level rewards used in many tasks, and (ii) alternatives to PPO-style clipping that aim to avoid the associated loss of training signal and entropy collapse. Recent work, such as Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO), reformulates the Scopic objective within the GRPO framework and achieves both sequence coherence and token adaptivity. Geometric-Mean Policy Optimization (GMPO) leverages token-wise ratio clipping within sequence importance sampling weights. Building on these ideas, this work proposes a new objective that promotes effective policy exploration while maintaining training stability. Specifically, we introduce Soft Sequence Policy Optimization, an off-policy reinforcement learning objective that incorporates soft gating functions over token-level probability ratios within sequence-level importance weights.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are increasingly explored for physical design analysis in Electronic Design Automation, particularly for modeling Clock Tree Synthesis behavior such as clock skew and buffering complexity. However, practical deployment remains limited due to the prohibitive memory and runtime cost of operating on raw gate-level netlists. Graph coarsening is commonly used to improve scalability, yet its impact on CTS-critical learning objectives is not well characterized. This paper introduces CTS-Bench, a benchmark suite for systematically evaluating the trade-offs between graph coarsening, prediction accuracy, and computational efficiency in GNN-based CTS analysis. CTS-Bench consists of 4,860 converged physical design solutions spanning five architectures and provides paired raw gate-level and clustered graph representations derived from post-placement designs. Using clock skew prediction as a representative CTS task, we demonstrate a clear accuracy-efficiency trade-off. While graph coarsening reduces GPU memory usage by up to 17.2x and accelerates training by up to 3x, it also removes structural information essential for modeling clock distribution, frequently resulting in negative $R^2$ scores under zero-shot evaluation. Our findings indicate that generic graph clustering techniques can fundamentally compromise CTS learning objectives, even when global physical metrics remain unchanged. CTS-Bench enables principled evaluation of CTS-aware graph coarsening strategies, supports benchmarking of GNN architectures and accelerators under realistic physical design constraints, and provides a foundation for developing learning-assisted CTS analysis and optimization techniques.

Abstract: Representational similarity metrics typically force all units to be matched, making them susceptible to noise and outliers common in neural representations. We extend the soft-matching distance to a partial optimal transport setting that allows some neurons to remain unmatched, yielding rotation-sensitive but robust correspondences. This partial soft-matching distance provides theoretical advantages -- relaxing strict mass conservation while maintaining interpretable transport costs -- and practical benefits through efficient neuron ranking in terms of cross-network alignment without costly iterative recomputation. In simulations, it preserves correct matches under outliers and reliably selects the correct model in noise-corrupted identification tasks. On fMRI data, it automatically excludes low-reliability voxels and produces voxel rankings by alignment quality that closely match computationally expensive brute-force approaches. It achieves higher alignment precision across homologous brain areas than standard soft-matching, which is forced to match all units regardless of quality. In deep networks, highly matched units exhibit similar maximally exciting images, while unmatched units show divergent patterns. This ability to partition by match quality enables focused analyses, e.g., testing whether networks have privileged axes even within their most aligned subpopulations. Overall, partial soft-matching provides a principled and practical method for representational comparison under partial correspondence.

Abstract: Model merging has emerged as a powerful paradigm for combining the capabilities of distinct expert models without the high computational cost of retraining, yet current methods are fundamentally constrained to homogeneous architectures. For GNNs, however, message passing is topology-dependent and sensitive to misalignment, making direct parameter-space merging unreliable. To bridge this gap, we introduce H-GRAMA (Heterogeneous Graph Routing and Message Alignment), a training-free framework that lifts merging from parameter space to operator space. We formalize Universal Message Passing Mixture (UMPM), a shared operator family that expresses heterogeneous GNN layers in a common functional language. H-GRAMA enables cross-architecture GNN merging (e.g., GCN to GAT) without retraining, retaining high specialist accuracy in most cases in compatible depth settings and achieving inference speedups of 1.2x to 1.9x over ensembles.

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has significantly advanced the training of large language models and enhanced their reasoning capabilities, while it remains susceptible to instability due to the use of hard clipping. Soft Adaptive Policy Optimization (SAPO) addresses this limitation by replacing clipping with a smooth sigmoid-based gate function, which leads to more stable updates. We have decided to push this theory further and investigate the impact of different gate functions on both training stability and final model performance. We formalize the key properties that admissible gates should satisfy and identify several families of such functions for empirical evaluation. This paper presents an analysis of our findings based on experiments conducted with the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model on mathematical reasoning tasks. These results provide practical guidance for designing smoother and more robust policy optimization objectives for large language model training.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Generalization is often regarded as an essential property of machine learning systems. However, perhaps not every component of a system needs to generalize. Training models for generalization typically produces entangled representations at the boundaries of entities or classes, which can lead to destructive interference when rapid, high-magnitude updates are required for continual or few-shot learning. Techniques for fast learning with non-interfering representations exist, but they generally fail to generalize. Here, we describe a Complementary Learning System (CLS) in which the fast learner entirely foregoes generalization in exchange for continual zero-shot and few-shot learning. Unlike most CLS approaches, which use episodic memory primarily for replay and consolidation, our fast, disentangled learner operates as a parallel reasoning system. The fast learner can overcome observation variability and uncertainty by leveraging a conventional slow, statistical learner within an active perception system: A contextual bias provided by the fast learner induces the slow learner to encode novel stimuli in familiar, generalized terms, enabling zero-shot and few-shot learning. This architecture demonstrates that fast, context-driven reasoning can coexist with slow, structured generalization, providing a pathway for robust continual learning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for Large Language Models (LLMs) frequently use on-policy algorithms, such as PPO or GRPO. However, policy lag from distributed training architectures and differences between the training and inference policies break this assumption, making the data off-policy by design. To rectify this, prior work has focused on making this off-policy data appear more on-policy, either via importance sampling (IS), or by more closely aligning the training and inference policies by explicitly modifying the inference engine. In this work, we embrace off-policyness and propose a novel off-policy RL algorithm that does not require these modifications: Optimal Advantage-based Policy Optimization with Lagged Inference policy (OAPL). We show that OAPL outperforms GRPO with importance sampling on competition math benchmarks, and can match the performance of a publicly available coding model, DeepCoder, on LiveCodeBench, while using 3x fewer generations during training. We further empirically demonstrate that models trained via OAPL have improved test time scaling under the Pass@k metric. OAPL allows for efficient, effective post-training even with lags of more than 400 gradient steps between the training and inference policies, 100x more off-policy than prior approaches.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning systems often suffer from unstable training dynamics due to non-stationarity, where learning objectives and data distributions evolve over time. We show that under non-stationary targets, isotropic Gaussian embeddings are provably advantageous. In particular, they induce stable tracking of time-varying targets for linear readouts, achieve maximal entropy under a fixed variance budget, and encourage a balanced use of all representational dimensions--all of which enable agents to be more adaptive and stable. Building on this insight, we propose the use of Sketched Isotropic Gaussian Regularization for shaping representations toward an isotropic Gaussian distribution during training. We demonstrate empirically, over a variety of domains, that this simple and computationally inexpensive method improves performance under non-stationarity while reducing representation collapse, neuron dormancy, and training instability.

TL;DR: 论文批评了之前研究中关于余弦相似度问题的结论，指出问题不在于余弦相似度本身，而在于嵌入向量没有归一化。通过理论证明，当嵌入向量约束在单位球面上时，余弦距离与欧氏距离之间存在单调等价关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 之前的研究（Steck等）发现矩阵分解模型学习的嵌入向量的余弦相似度可以通过对角'规范'矩阵D变得任意，因此警告不要使用余弦相似度。本文认为这个结论混淆了训练目标不兼容的问题与单位球面上余弦距离的几何有效性。

Method: 通过理论分析证明：当嵌入向量被约束在单位球面 𝕊^{d-1} 上时（无论是在训练期间还是之后使用适当的目标函数），D矩阵模糊性会完全消失，余弦距离正好等于欧氏距离平方的一半。

Result: 证明了在归一化嵌入向量上，余弦相似度与欧氏距离之间存在单调等价关系。这意味着基于余弦和基于欧氏的邻居排序在归一化嵌入上是完全相同的。

Conclusion: 余弦相似度的'问题'不是余弦相似度本身，而是没有进行归一化处理。当嵌入向量被适当归一化时，余弦相似度是完全有效的度量工具。

Abstract: Steck, Ekanadham, and Kallus [arXiv:2403.05440] demonstrate that cosine similarity of learned embeddings from matrix factorization models can be rendered arbitrary by a diagonal ``gauge'' matrix $D$. Their result is correct and important for practitioners who compute cosine similarity on embeddings trained with dot-product objectives. However, we argue that their conclusion, cautioning against cosine similarity in general, conflates the pathology of an incompatible training objective with the geometric validity of cosine distance on the unit sphere. We prove that when embeddings are constrained to the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$ (either during or after training with an appropriate objective), the $D$-matrix ambiguity vanishes identically, and cosine distance reduces to exactly half the squared Euclidean distance. This monotonic equivalence implies that cosine-based and Euclidean-based neighbor rankings are identical on normalized embeddings. The ``problem'' with cosine similarity is not cosine similarity, it is the failure to normalize.

Abstract: The rise of app-based ride-sharing has fundamentally changed tipping culture in New York City. We analyzed 280 million trips from 2024 to see if we could predict tips for traditional taxis versus high-volume for-hire services. By testing methods from linear regression to deep neural networks, we found two very different outcomes. Traditional taxis are highly predictable ($R^2 \approx 0.72$) due to the in-car payment screen. In contrast, app-based tipping is random and hard to model ($R^2 \approx 0.17$). In conclusion, we show that building one universal model is a mistake and, due to Simpson's paradox, a combined model looks accurate on average but fails to predict tips for individual taxi categories requiring specialized models.

Abstract: Long-range geophysical forecasts are fundamentally limited by chaotic dynamics and numerical errors. While data assimilation can mitigate these issues, classical variational smoothers require computationally expensive tangent-linear and adjoint models. Conversely, recent efficient latent filtering methods often enforce weak trajectory-level constraints and assume fixed observation grids. To bridge this gap, we propose Latent Ensemble Variational Data Assimilation (LEVDA), an ensemble-space variational smoother that operates in the low-dimensional latent space of a pretrained differentiable neural dynamics surrogate. By performing four-dimensional ensemble-variational (4DEnVar) optimization within an ensemble subspace, LEVDA jointly assimilates states and unknown parameters without the need for adjoint code or auxiliary observation-to-latent encoders. Leveraging the fully differentiable, continuous-in-time-and-space nature of the surrogate, LEVDA naturally accommodates highly irregular sampling at arbitrary spatiotemporal locations. Across three challenging geophysical benchmarks, LEVDA matches or outperforms state-of-the-art latent filtering baselines under severe observational sparsity while providing more reliable uncertainty quantification. Simultaneously, it achieves substantially improved assimilation accuracy and computational efficiency compared to full-state 4DEnVar.

Abstract: Concentrated liquidity provision in decentralized exchanges presents a fundamental Impulse Control problem. Liquidity Providers (LPs) face a non-trivial trade-off between maximizing fee accrual through tight price-range concentration and minimizing the friction costs of rebalancing, including gas fees and swap slippage. Existing methods typically employ heuristic or threshold strategies that fail to account for market dynamics. This paper formulates liquidity management as an optimal control problem and derives the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman quasi-variational inequality (HJB-QVI). We present an approximate solution RAmmStein, a Deep Reinforcement Learning method that incorporates the mean-reversion speed (theta) of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process among other features as input to the model. We demonstrate that the agent learns to separate the state space into regions of action and inaction. We evaluate the framework using high-frequency 1Hz Coinbase trade data comprising over 6.8M trades. Experimental results show that RAmmStein achieves a superior net ROI of 0.72% compared to both passive and aggressive strategies. Notably, the agent reduces rebalancing frequency by 67% compared to a greedy rebalancing strategy while maintaining 88% active time. Our results demonstrate that regime-aware laziness can significantly improve capital efficiency by preserving the returns that would otherwise be eroded by the operational costs.

Abstract: Understanding the conformational evolution of $β$-amyloid ($Aβ$), particularly the $Aβ_{42}$ isoform, is fundamental to elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease. However, existing end-to-end deep learning models often struggle to capture subtle state transitions in protein trajectories due to a lack of explicit physical constraints. In this work, we introduce PIS, a Physics-Informed System designed for robust metastable state partitioning. By integrating pre-computed physical priors, such as the radius of gyration and solvent-accessible surface area, into the extraction of topological features, our model achieves superior performance on the $Aβ_{42}$ dataset. Furthermore, PIS provides an interactive platform that features dynamic monitoring of physical characteristics and multi-dimensional result validation. This system offers biological researchers a powerful set of analytical tools with physically grounded interpretability. A demonstration video of PIS is available on https://youtu.be/AJHGzUtRCg0.

Abstract: Time-series diagnostic reasoning is essential for many applications, yet existing solutions face a persistent gap: general reasoning large language models (GRLMs) possess strong reasoning skills but lack the domain-specific knowledge to understand complex time-series patterns. Conversely, fine-tuned time-series LLMs (TSLMs) understand these patterns but lack the capacity to generalize reasoning for more complicated questions. To bridge this gap, we propose a hybrid knowledge-injection framework that injects TSLM-generated insights directly into GRLM's reasoning trace, thereby achieving strong time-series reasoning with in-domain knowledge. As collecting data for knowledge injection fine-tuning is costly, we further leverage a reinforcement learning-based approach with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit knowledge-rich traces without human supervision, then transfer such an in-domain thinking trace into GRLM for efficient knowledge injection. We further release SenTSR-Bench, a multivariate time-series-based diagnostic reasoning benchmark collected from real-world industrial operations. Across SenTSR-Bench and other public datasets, our method consistently surpasses TSLMs by 9.1%-26.1% and GRLMs by 7.9%-22.4%, delivering robust, context-aware time-series diagnostic insights.

Abstract: Quantifying uncertainty in clinical predictions is critical for high-stakes diagnosis tasks. Conformal prediction offers a principled approach by providing prediction sets with theoretical coverage guarantees. However, in practice, patient distribution shifts violate the i.i.d. assumptions underlying standard conformal methods, leading to poor coverage in healthcare settings. In this work, we evaluate several conformal prediction approaches on EEG seizure classification, a task with known distribution shift challenges and label uncertainty. We demonstrate that personalized calibration strategies can improve coverage by over 20 percentage points while maintaining comparable prediction set sizes.

Abstract: The merit of Conformal Prediction (CP), as a distribution-free framework for uncertainty quantification, depends on generating prediction sets that are efficient, reflected in small average set sizes, while adaptive, meaning they signal uncertainty by varying in size according to input difficulty. A central limitation for deep conformal classifiers is that the nonconformity scores are derived from softmax outputs, which can be unreliable indicators of how certain the model truly is about a given input, sometimes leading to overconfident misclassifications or undue hesitation. In this work, we argue that this unreliability can be inherited by the prediction sets generated by CP, limiting their capacity for adaptiveness. We propose a new approach that leverages information from the pre-softmax logit space, using the Helmholtz Free Energy as a measure of model uncertainty and sample difficulty. By reweighting nonconformity scores with a monotonic transformation of the energy score of each sample, we improve their sensitivity to input difficulty. Our experiments with four state-of-the-art score functions on multiple datasets and deep architectures show that this energy-based enhancement improves the adaptiveness of the prediction sets, leading to a notable increase in both efficiency and adaptiveness compared to baseline nonconformity scores, without introducing any post-hoc complexity.

Abstract: Data mixing--the strategic reweighting of training domains--is a critical component in training robust machine learning models. This problem is naturally formulated as a bilevel optimization task, where the outer loop optimizes domain weights to minimize validation loss, and the inner loop optimizes model parameters to minimize the weighted training loss. Classical bilevel optimization relies on hypergradients, which theoretically require the inner optimization to reach convergence. However, due to computational constraints, state-of-the-art methods use a finite, often small, number of inner update steps before updating the weights. The theoretical implications of this approximation are not well understood. In this work, we rigorously analyze the convergence behavior of data mixing with a finite number of inner steps $T$. We prove that the "greedy" practical approach of using $T=1$ can fail even in a simple quadratic example. Under a fixed parameter update budget $N$ and assuming the per-domain losses are strongly convex, we show that the optimal $T$ scales as $Θ(\log N)$ (resp., $Θ({(N \log N)}^{1/2})$) for the data mixing problem with access to full (resp., stochastic) gradients. We complement our theoretical results with proof-of-concept experiments.

Abstract: Crash classification models in transportation safety are typically evaluated using accuracy, F1, or AUC, metrics that cannot reveal whether a model is silently overfitting. We introduce a spectral diagnostic framework grounded in Random Matrix Theory (RMT) and Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HTSR) that spans the ML taxonomy: weight matrices for BERT/ALBERT/Qwen2.5, out-of-fold increment matrices for XGBoost/Random Forest, empirical Hessians for Logistic Regression, induced affinity matrices for Decision Trees, and Graph Laplacians for KNN. Evaluating nine model families on two Iowa DOT crash classification tasks (173,512 and 371,062 records respectively), we find that the power-law exponent $α$ provides a structural quality signal: well-regularized models consistently yield $α$ within $[2, 4]$ (mean $2.87 \pm 0.34$), while overfit variants show $α< 2$ or spectral collapse. We observe a strong rank correlation between $α$ and expert agreement (Spearman $ρ= 0.89$, $p < 0.001$), suggesting spectral quality captures model behaviors aligned with expert reasoning. We propose an $α$-based early stopping criterion and a spectral model selection protocol, and validate both against cross-validated F1 baselines. Sparse Lanczos approximations make the framework scalable to large datasets.

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series with missing values present significant challenges for predictive modeling in domains such as healthcare. While deep learning approaches often focus on temporal interpolation or complex architectures to handle irregularities, we propose a simpler yet effective alternative: extracting time-agnostic summary statistics to eliminate the temporal axis. Our method computes four key features per variable-mean and standard deviation of observed values, as well as the mean and variability of changes between consecutive observations to create a fixed-dimensional representation. These features are then utilized with standard classifiers, such as logistic regression and XGBoost. Evaluated on four biomedical datasets (PhysioNet Challenge 2012, 2019, PAMAP2, and MIMIC-III), our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing recent transformer and graph-based models by 0.5-1.7% in AUROC/AUPRC and 1.1-1.7% in accuracy/F1-score, while reducing computational complexity. Ablation studies demonstrate that feature extraction-not classifier choice-drives performance gains, and our summary statistics outperform raw/imputed input in most benchmarks. In particular, we identify scenarios where missing patterns themselves encode predictive signals, as in sepsis prediction (PhysioNet, 2019), where missing indicators alone can achieve 94.2% AUROC with XGBoost, only 1.6% lower than using original raw data as input. Our results challenge the necessity of complex temporal modeling when task objectives permit time-agnostic representations, providing an efficient and interpretable solution for irregular time series classification.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of replicable realizable PAC learning. We construct a particularly hard learning problem and show a sample complexity lower bound with a close to $(\log|H|)^{3/2}$ dependence on the size of the hypothesis class $H$. Our proof uses several novel techniques and works by defining a particular Cayley graph associated with $H$ and analyzing a suitable random walk on this graph by examining the spectral properties of its adjacency matrix.
  Furthermore, we show an almost matching upper bound for the lower bound instance, meaning if a stronger lower bound exists, one would have to consider a different instance of the problem.

Abstract: We introduce Leap+Verify, a framework that applies speculative execution -- predicting future model weights and validating predictions before acceptance -- to accelerate neural network training. Inspired by speculative decoding in language model inference and by the Automatically Scalable Computation (ASC) architecture for program execution, Leap+Verify decomposes training into three dynamically detected regimes (chaotic, transition, stable) using activation-space cosine similarity as a real-time Lyapunov proxy signal. Within each regime, analytic weight predictors (momentum, linear, quadratic extrapolation) attempt to forecast model parameters K training steps ahead; predictions are accepted only when validated against a held-out loss criterion. We evaluate Leap+Verify on GPT-2 124M and Qwen 2.5-1.5B trained on WikiText-103 across five random seeds, sweeping prediction depth K in {5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100}. Momentum-based prediction (Adam moment extrapolation) fails catastrophically at both scales, with predicted losses exceeding actuals by 100-10,000x -- a universal norm explosion in optimizer-state extrapolation. Finite-difference predictors (linear, quadratic) succeed where momentum fails: at 124M, they achieve 24% strict acceptance at K=5 in stable regimes; at 1.5B, they achieve 37% strict acceptance in transition regimes. The scale-dependent finding is in regime distribution: GPT-2 124M spends 34% of training in stable regime, while Qwen 1.5B spends 64% in chaotic regime and reaches stable in only 0-2 of 40 checkpoints. Larger models are more predictable when predictable, but less often predictable -- the practical bottleneck shifts from predictor accuracy to regime availability. Cross-seed results are highly consistent (less than 1% validation loss variance), and the three-regime framework produces identical phase boundaries (plus or minus 50 steps) across seeds.

Abstract: Extensive research demonstrates that Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) models are susceptible to adversarially constructed inputs (i.e., adversarial examples), which can mislead the agent to take suboptimal or unsafe actions. Recent methods improve attack effectiveness by leveraging future rewards to guide adversarial perturbation generation over sequential time steps (i.e., reward-based attacks). However, these methods are unable to capture dependencies between different time steps in the perturbation generation process, resulting in a weak temporal correlation between the current perturbation and previous perturbations.In this paper, we propose a novel method called Advantage-based Adversarial Transformer (AAT), which can generate adversarial examples with stronger temporal correlations (i.e., time-correlated adversarial examples) to improve the attack performance. AAT employs a multi-scale causal self-attention (MSCSA) mechanism to dynamically capture dependencies between historical information from different time periods and the current state, thus enhancing the correlation between the current perturbation and the previous perturbation. Moreover, AAT introduces a weighted advantage mechanism, which quantifies the effectiveness of a perturbation in a given state and guides the generation process toward high-performance adversarial examples by sampling high-advantage regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the performance of AAT matches or surpasses mainstream adversarial attack baselines on Atari, DeepMind Control Suite and Google football tasks.

Abstract: Despite the success of machine learning (ML) in surrogate modeling, its use in radiation dose assessment is limited by safety-critical constraints, scarce training-ready data, and challenges in selecting suitable architectures for physics-dominated systems. Within this context, rapid and accurate plume shine dose estimation serves as a practical test case, as it is critical for nuclear facility safety assessment and radiological emergency response, while conventional photon-transport-based calculations remain computationally expensive. In this work, an interpolation-assisted ML framework was developed using discrete dose datasets generated with the pyDOSEIA suite for 17 gamma-emitting radionuclides across varying downwind distances, release heights, and atmospheric stability categories. The datasets were augmented using shape-preserving interpolation to construct dense, high-resolution training data. Two tree-based ML models (Random Forest and XGBoost) and one deep learning (DL) model (TabNet) were evaluated to examine predictive performance and sensitivity to dataset resolution. All models showed higher prediction accuracy with the interpolated high-resolution dataset than with the discrete data; however, XGBoost consistently achieved the highest accuracy. Interpretability analysis using permutation importance (tree-based models) and attention-based feature attribution (TabNet) revealed that performance differences stem from how the models utilize input features. Tree-based models focus mainly on dominant geometry-dispersion features (release height, stability category, and downwind distance), treating radionuclide identity as a secondary input, whereas TabNet distributes attention more broadly across multiple variables. For practical deployment, a web-based GUI was developed for interactive scenario evaluation and transparent comparison with photon-transport reference calculations.

Abstract: We introduce ISO-Bench, a benchmark for coding agents to test their capabilities on real-world inference optimization tasks. These tasks were taken from vLLM and SGLang, two of the most popular LLM serving frameworks. Each task provides an agent with a codebase and bottleneck description, whereby the agent must produce an optimization patch evaluated against expert human solutions. We curated 54 tasks from merged pull requests with measurable performance improvements. While existing benchmarks heavily use runtime-based metrics, such approaches can be gamed to pass tests without capturing the actual intent of the code changes. Therefore, we combine both hard (execution-based) and soft (LLM-based) metrics to show that both are necessary for complete evaluation. While evaluating both closed and open-source coding agents, we find no single agent dominates across codebases. Surprisingly, agents often identify correct bottlenecks but fail to execute working solutions. We also show that agents with identical underlying models differ substantially, suggesting scaffolding is as important as the model.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文开发了一种用于贝叶斯混合数据采样（MIDAS）回归的坐标上升变分推断（CAVI）算法，通过线性权重参数化实现高效推理，相比传统MCMC方法获得显著速度提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统贝叶斯MIDAS回归的哈密顿蒙特卡洛采样器因模型的双线性结构而不可靠，需要开发能够利用条件共轭性的高效变分推断算法来平衡计算效率和统计精度。

Method: 采用坐标上升变分推断（CAVI）算法，通过归一化约束将影响系数与权重函数参数分离，创建双线性结构。每个变分更新都有闭式解：回归系数和权重参数为高斯分布，误差方差为逆Gamma分布。算法通过二阶矩在块间传播不确定性。

Result: 在包含最多50个预测变量的21种数据生成配置中，CAVI产生的后验均值与块吉布斯采样基准几乎相同，速度提升107倍到1,772倍。权重函数参数保持优异校准（覆盖率>92%），而影响系数的可信区间存在均值场近似典型的离散不足问题。

Conclusion: CAVI为贝叶斯MIDAS回归提供了快速准确的推理方法，在点估计方面与Gibbs采样几乎相同，但在置信区间校准方面存在均值场近似的固有限制。实证应用显示CAVI可在10毫秒内完成月度估计，证明了模型特定推导的价值。

Abstract: We develop a Coordinate Ascent Variational Inference (CAVI) algorithm for Bayesian Mixed Data Sampling (MIDAS) regression with linear weight parameteri zations. The model separates impact coe cients from weighting function parameters through a normalization constraint, creating a bilinear structure that renders generic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo samplers unreliable while preserving conditional conju gacy exploitable by CAVI. Each variational update admits a closed-form solution: Gaussian for regression coe cients and weight parameters, Inverse-Gamma for the error variance. The algorithm propagates uncertainty across blocks through second moments, distinguishing it from naive plug-in approximations. In a Monte Carlo study spanning 21 data-generating con gurations with up to 50 predictors, CAVI produces posterior means nearly identical to a block Gibbs sampler benchmark while achieving speedups of 107x to 1,772x (Table 9). Generic automatic di eren tiation VI (ADVI), by contrast, produces bias 714 times larger while being orders of magnitude slower, con rming the value of model-speci c derivations. Weight function parameters maintain excellent calibration (coverage above 92%) across all con gurations. Impact coe cient credible intervals exhibit the underdispersion characteristic of mean- eld approximations, with coverage declining from 89% to 55% as the number of predictors grows a documented trade-o between speed and interval calibration that structured variational methods can address. An empirical application to realized volatility forecasting on S&P 500 daily returns con rms that CAVI and Gibbs sampling yield virtually identical point forecasts, with CAVI completing each monthly estimation in under 10 milliseconds.

TL;DR: 离散扩散语言模型(dLLMs)存在评估挑战，传统指标混淆了去噪器近似误差和采样器引入误差。作者提出基于隐马尔可夫模型后验的采样中心框架，发现少步离散扩散采样即使使用完美去噪器也不是分布正确的。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散扩散语言模型通过并行迭代去噪提供快速灵活的生成方式，但现有评估指标存在缺陷: 它们将去噪器近似误差和采样器引入的误差混为一谈，而自回归模型的采样完全反映学习到的概率模型，不存在此问题。为了分离这两类误差，需要建立受控评估框架。

Method: 提出采样中心框架框架，用真实马尔可夫链推导的精确隐马尔可夫模型后验替换学习到的去噪器，在受控环境中隔离采样器引入的误差。该框架允许分析采样器本身的性能，而不受去噪器质量影响。

Result: 1. 少步离散扩散采样器即使在理论完美去噪器下也不是分布正确的
2. 只有在采样步数接近序列长度时，转移层面的不匹配才会消失
3. 负对数似然、生成困惑度或MAUVE等指标的改进并不能保证采样的正确性

Conclusion: 离散扩散语言模型的评估需要专门考虑采样器引入的误差，传统指标可能产生误导。研究揭示了少步采样在分布正确性方面的根本限制，并为开发更可靠的评估方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion language models (dLLMs) provide a fast and flexible alternative to autoregressive models (ARMs) via iterative denoising with parallel updates. However, their evaluation is challenging: existing metrics conflate denoiser approximation error with sampler-induced error from the sampling dynamics, a problem that does not arise for ARMs whose autoregressive sampling exactly reflects the learned probability model. We introduce a sampler-centric oracle framework that replaces learned denoisers with an exact Hidden Markov Model posterior derived from a ground-truth Markov chain, isolating sampler-induced error in a controlled setting. We show that few-step discrete diffusion samplers are not distributionally correct even under an oracle denoiser, with transition-level mismatch that vanishes only as the number of steps approaches the sequence length. Moreover, improvements in negative log-likelihood, generative perplexity, or MAUVE do not imply correct sampling. Code is available at https://luhantang.github.io/dllm_sampler

Conclusion: VecFormer通过向量量化策略解决了图Transformer的计算效率和泛化能力难题，为节点分类任务提供了一个高效且泛化性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Transformer has demonstrated impressive capabilities in the field of graph representation learning. However, existing approaches face two critical challenges: (1) most models suffer from exponentially increasing computational complexity, making it difficult to scale to large graphs; (2) attention mechanisms based on node-level operations limit the flexibility of the model and result in poor generalization performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{VecFormer} (the \textbf{Vec}tor Quantized Graph Trans\textbf{former}), an efficient and highly generalizable model for node classification, particularly under OOD settings. VecFormer adopts a two-stage training paradigm. In the first stage, two codebooks are used to reconstruct the node features and the graph structure, aiming to learn the rich semantic \texttt{Graph Codes}. In the second stage, attention mechanisms are performed at the \texttt{Graph Token} level based on the transformed cross codebook, reducing computational complexity while enhancing the model's generalization capability. Extensive experiments on datasets of various sizes demonstrate that VecFormer outperforms the existing Graph Transformer in both performance and speed.

Conclusion: Jumpy世界模型通过一致性目标增强的时间抽象建模和组合性规划，为长时域决策提供了有效框架，验证了其在复杂任务中结合预训练策略的零样本泛化能力

Abstract: The ability to plan with temporal abstractions is central to intelligent decision-making. Rather than reasoning over primitive actions, we study agents that compose pre-trained policies as temporally extended actions, enabling solutions to complex tasks that no constituent alone can solve. Such compositional planning remains elusive as compounding errors in long-horizon predictions make it challenging to estimate the visitation distribution induced by sequencing policies. Motivated by the geometric policy composition framework introduced in arXiv:2206.08736, we address these challenges by learning predictive models of multi-step dynamics -- so-called jumpy world models -- that capture state occupancies induced by pre-trained policies across multiple timescales in an off-policy manner. Building on Temporal Difference Flows (arXiv:2503.09817), we enhance these models with a novel consistency objective that aligns predictions across timescales, improving long-horizon predictive accuracy. We further demonstrate how to combine these generative predictions to estimate the value of executing arbitrary sequences of policies over varying timescales. Empirically, we find that compositional planning with jumpy world models significantly improves zero-shot performance across a wide range of base policies on challenging manipulation and navigation tasks, yielding, on average, a 200% relative improvement over planning with primitive actions on long-horizon tasks.

Motivation: 研究量子核方法在数据污染下的性能退化行为，分析不同量子特征构建方式在噪声环境中的鲁棒性差异，为NISQ时代的量子机器学习提供鲁棒性优先的设计视角。

Conclusion: 量子核的鲁棒性关键取决于结构对齐的预处理及其与对角嵌入的相互作用，这支持了NISQ时代量子机器学习的鲁棒性优先视角，DFT基预处理在噪声环境下表现出优越性。

Abstract: Quantum kernel methods are promising for near-term quantum ma- chine learning, yet their behavior under data corruption remains insuf- ficiently understood. We analyze how quantum feature constructions degrade under controlled additive noise. We introduce Spectral Phase Encoding (SPE), a hybrid construc- tion combining a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) front-end with a diagonal phase-only embedding aligned with the geometry of diagonal quantum maps. Within a unified framework, we compare QK-DFT against alternative quantum variants (QK-PCA, QK-RP) and classi- cal SVM baselines under identical clean-data hyperparameter selection, quantifying robustness via dataset fixed-effects regression with wild cluster bootstrap inference across heterogeneous real-world datasets. Across the quantum family, DFT-based preprocessing yields the smallest degradation rate as noise increases, with statistically sup- ported slope differences relative to PCA and RP. Compared to classical baselines, QK-DFT shows degradation comparable to linear SVM and more stable than RBF SVM under matched tuning. Hardware exper- iments confirm that SPE remains executable and numerically stable for overlap estimation. These results indicate that robustness in quan- tum kernels depends critically on structure-aligned preprocessing and its interaction with diagonal embeddings, supporting a robustness-first perspective for NISQ-era quantum machine learning.

Abstract: Urban air pollution in megacities poses critical public health challenges, particularly in Delhi National Capital Region (NCR) where severe degradation affects millions. We present NEXUS (Neural Extraction and Unified Spatiotemporal) architecture for forecasting carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, and sulfur dioxide. Working with four years (2018--2021) of atmospheric data across sixteen spatial grids, NEXUS achieves R$^2$ exceeding 0.94 for CO, 0.91 for NO, and 0.95 for SO$_2$ using merely 18,748 parameters -- substantially fewer than SCINet (35,552), Autoformer (68,704), and FEDformer (298,080). The architecture integrates patch embedding, low-rank projections, and adaptive fusion mechanisms to decode complex atmospheric chemistry patterns. Our investigation uncovers distinct diurnal rhythms and pronounced seasonal variations, with winter months experiencing severe pollution episodes driven by temperature inversions and agricultural biomass burning. Analysis identifies critical meteorological thresholds, quantifies wind field impacts on pollutant dispersion, and maps spatial heterogeneity across the region. Extensive ablation experiments demonstrate each architectural component's role. NEXUS delivers superior predictive performance with remarkable computational efficiency, enabling real-time deployment for air quality monitoring systems.

Abstract: Continual learning systems are increasingly deployed in environments where retraining or reset is infeasible, yet many approaches emphasize task performance rather than the evolution of internal representations over time. In this work, we study a minimal continual learning agent designed to isolate representational dynamics from architectural complexity and optimization objectives. The agent maintains a persistent state vector across executions and incrementally updates it as new textual data is introduced. We quantify representational change using cosine similarity between successive normalized state vectors and define a stability metric over time intervals. Longitudinal experiments across eight executions reveal a transition from an initial plastic regime to a stable representational regime under consistent input. A deliberately introduced semantic perturbation produces a bounded decrease in similarity, followed by recovery and restabilization under subsequent coherent input. These results demonstrate that meaningful stability plasticity tradeoffs can emerge in a minimal, stateful learning system without explicit regularization, replay, or architectural complexity. The work establishes a transparent empirical baseline for studying representational accumulation and adaptation in continual learning systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PaReGTA是一种基于大语言模型的编码框架，其使用模板化文本和轻量化对比微调将纵向电子健康记录转化为固定维度的患者表示，并通过混合时序池化捕捉最近和全局信息性就诊。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决结构化电子健康记录中时序信息的丢失问题，以及序列模型成本高昂和数据需求大的不足。

Method: 首先将纵向EHR事件转换为带有明确时间线索的访问级别模板文本，然后用轻量化的对比微调学习适合特定领域的访问嵌入，并通过混合时序池化将访问嵌入聚合成固定维度的患者表示。

Result: 在All of Us研究计划的39,088名偏头痛患者数据上，PaReGTA在偏头痛类型分类任务上优于稀疏基线模型，而深度序列模型在相同队列中表现不稳定。

Conclusion: PaReGTA能够有效利用预训练大语言模型，在数据有限的情况下表现良好，是一种模型无关的框架，可以从未来的EHR专业句子嵌入模型中获益。

Abstract: Temporal information in structured electronic health records (EHRs) is often lost in sparse one-hot or count-based representations, while sequence models can be costly and data-hungry. We propose PaReGTA, an LLM-based encoding framework that (i) converts longitudinal EHR events into visit-level templated text with explicit temporal cues, (ii) learns domain-adapted visit embeddings via lightweight contrastive fine-tuning of a sentence-embedding model, and (iii) aggregates visit embeddings into a fixed-dimensional patient representation using hybrid temporal pooling that captures both recency and globally informative visits. Because PaReGTA does not require training from scratch but instead utilizes a pre-trained LLM, it can perform well even in data-limited cohorts. Furthermore, PaReGTA is model-agnostic and can benefit from future EHR-specialized sentence-embedding models. For interpretability, we introduce PaReGTA-RSS (Representation Shift Score), which quantifies clinically defined factor importance by recomputing representations after targeted factor removal and projecting representation shifts through a machine learning model. On 39,088 migraine patients from the All of Us Research Program, PaReGTA outperforms sparse baselines for migraine type classification while deep sequential models were unstable in our cohort.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于单细胞扰动响应预测的新模型 PerturbDiff，通过将分布建模为希尔伯特空间中的点，使用扩散生成过程直接操作概率分布，从而捕获隐藏因素引起的群体水平响应变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前单细胞测序是破坏性的，无法观测同一细胞在扰动前后的状态，预测扰动响应需映射未配对的对照组和处理组。现有模型假设固定响应分布，而实际响应因微环境波动等隐藏因素存在系统性变异，形成分布流形。需要解决这一可变性问题以提高预测准确性。

Method: 提出 PerturbDiff 模型，将建模对象从单个细胞扩展到整个分布。将分布表示为希尔伯特空间中的点，定义基于扩散的生成过程直接在概率分布上进行操作，以捕获隐藏因素引起的群体水平响应变化。

Result: 在标准数据集上的基准测试表明，PerturbDiff 在单细胞响应预测方面实现了最先进的性能，并且在对未见扰动的泛化能力上有显著提升。

Conclusion: PerturbDiff 通过分布层面的生成建模，有效解决了单细胞扰动响应预测中隐藏因素引起的可变性问题，实现了优异的预测性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Building Virtual Cells that can accurately simulate cellular responses to perturbations is a long-standing goal in systems biology. A fundamental challenge is that high-throughput single-cell sequencing is destructive: the same cell cannot be observed both before and after a perturbation. Thus, perturbation prediction requires mapping unpaired control and perturbed populations. Existing models address this by learning maps between distributions, but typically assume a single fixed response distribution when conditioned on observed cellular context (e.g., cell type) and the perturbation type. In reality, responses vary systematically due to unobservable latent factors such as microenvironmental fluctuations and complex batch effects, forming a manifold of possible distributions for the same observed conditions. To account for this variability, we introduce PerturbDiff, which shifts modeling from individual cells to entire distributions. By embedding distributions as points in a Hilbert space, we define a diffusion-based generative process operating directly over probability distributions. This allows PerturbDiff to capture population-level response shifts across hidden factors. Benchmarks on established datasets show that PerturbDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-cell response prediction and generalizes substantially better to unseen perturbations. See our project page (https://katarinayuan.github.io/PerturbDiff-ProjectPage/), where code and data will be made publicly available (https://github.com/DeepGraphLearning/PerturbDiff).

Abstract: Algorithm unrolling is ubiquitous in machine learning, particularly in hyperparameter optimization and meta-learning, where Jacobians of solution mappings are computed by differentiating through iterative algorithms. Although unrolling is known to yield asymptotically correct Jacobians under suitable conditions, recent work has shown that the derivative iterates may initially diverge from the true Jacobian, a phenomenon known as the curse of unrolling. In this work, we provide a non-asymptotic analysis that explains the origin of this behavior and identifies the algorithmic factors that govern it. We show that truncating early iterations of the derivative computation mitigates the curse while simultaneously reducing memory requirements. Finally, we demonstrate that warm-starting in bilevel optimization naturally induces an implicit form of truncation, providing a practical remedy. Our theoretical findings are supported by numerical experiments on representative examples.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence has emerged as a promising field of research to address reliability concerns in artificial intelligence. Despite significant progress in explainable artificial intelligence, few methods provide a systematic way to visualize and understand how classes are confused and how their relationships evolve as training progresses. In this work, we present GRAPHIC, an architecture-agnostic approach that analyzes neural networks on a class level. It leverages confusion matrices derived from intermediate layers using linear classifiers. We interpret these as adjacency matrices of directed graphs, allowing tools from network science to visualize and quantify learning dynamics across training epochs and intermediate layers. GRAPHIC provides insights into linear class separability, dataset issues, and architectural behavior, revealing, for example, similarities between flatfish and man and labeling ambiguities validated in a human study. In summary, by uncovering real confusions, GRAPHIC offers new perspectives on how neural networks learn. The code is available at https://github.com/Johanna-S-Froehlich/GRAPHIC.

Abstract: Mendelian Randomization (MR) is a prominent observational epidemiological research method designed to address unobserved confounding when estimating causal effects. However, core assumptions -- particularly the independence between instruments and unobserved confounders -- are often violated due to population stratification or assortative mating. Leveraging the increasing availability of multi-environment data, we propose a representation learning framework that exploits cross-environment invariance to recover latent exogenous components of genetic instruments. We provide theoretical guarantees for identifying these latent instruments under various mixing mechanisms and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through simulations and semi-synthetic experiments using data from the All of Us Research Hub.

Abstract: As Operational Technology increasingly integrates with Information Technology, the need for Intrusion Detection Systems becomes more important. This paper explores an unsupervised approach to anomaly detection in network traffic using $β$-Variational Autoencoders on the NSL-KDD dataset. We investigate two methods: leveraging the latent space structure by measuring distances from test samples to the training data projections, and using the reconstruction error as a conventional anomaly detection metric. By comparing these approaches, we provide insights into their respective advantages and limitations in an unsupervised setting. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of latent space exploitation for classification tasks.

Motivation: 现有的元学习方法在处理分布外目标任务时表现不佳，常常受到从源任务到目标任务迁移过程中产生的负迁移影响。因此，需要一种能够基于底层因果机制相似性而非表面虚假相关性进行任务迁移的方法。

Method: 提出一种因果感知的贝叶斯元学习方法，利用预先计算的潜在因果任务嵌入来条件化任务特定先验。该方法特别考虑了实际部署场景，其中目标任务数据有限，且适应过程依赖于专家提供的源任务与目标任务间因果相似性的噪声两两判断。

Result: 理论上，通过条件化因果嵌入来控制先验不匹配，并在任务偏移下缓解负迁移。实证上，在受控模拟和大规模真实世界临床预测（跨疾病迁移）场景中，均显示负迁移减少和分布外适应能力提升，且因果嵌入与底层临床机制保持一致。

Conclusion: 该方法通过基于因果相似性而非虚假相关性进行任务迁移，有效增强了元学习在分布外任务上的适应能力，并在理论和实证层面验证了其在缓解负迁移问题上的有效性。

Abstract: Meta-learning methods perform well on new within-distribution tasks but often fail when adapting to out-of-distribution target tasks, where transfer from source tasks can induce negative transfer. We propose a causally-aware Bayesian meta-learning method, by conditioning task-specific priors on precomputed latent causal task embeddings, enabling transfer based on mechanistic similarity rather than spurious correlations. Our approach explicitly considers realistic deployment settings where access to target-task data is limited, and adaptation relies on noisy (expert-provided) pairwise judgments of causal similarity between source and target tasks. We provide a theoretical analysis showing that conditioning on causal embeddings controls prior mismatch and mitigates negative transfer under task shift. Empirically, we demonstrate reductions in negative transfer and improved out-of-distribution adaptation in both controlled simulations and a large-scale real-world clinical prediction setting for cross-disease transfer, where causal embeddings align with underlying clinical mechanisms.

Abstract: This position paper argues that the machine learning community must move from preaching to practising data frugality for responsible artificial intelligence (AI) development. For long, progress has been equated with ever-larger datasets, driving remarkable advances but now yielding increasingly diminishing performance gains alongside rising energy use and carbon emissions. While awareness of data frugal approaches has grown, their adoption has remained rhetorical, and data scaling continues to dominate development practice. We argue that this gap between preach and practice must be closed, as continued data scaling entails substantial and under-accounted environmental impacts. To ground our position, we provide indicative estimates of the energy use and carbon emissions associated with the downstream use of ImageNet-1K. We then present empirical evidence that data frugality is both practical and beneficial, demonstrating that coreset-based subset selection can substantially reduce training energy consumption with little loss in accuracy, while also mitigating dataset bias. Finally, we outline actionable recommendations for moving data frugality from rhetorical preach to concrete practice for responsible development of AI.

Conclusion: 基于 conformal predictions 的方法为概念漂移定位提供了有效解决方案，特别适用于高维低信噪比场景。

Abstract: Concept drift -- the change of the distribution over time -- poses significant challenges for learning systems and is of central interest for monitoring. Understanding drift is thus paramount, and drift localization -- determining which samples are affected by the drift -- is essential. While several approaches exist, most rely on local testing schemes, which tend to fail in high-dimensional, low-signal settings. In this work, we consider a fundamentally different approach based on conformal predictions. We discuss and show the shortcomings of common approaches and demonstrate the performance of our approach on state-of-the-art image datasets.

Motivation: Mamba-based模型在离线强化学习中表现不佳，因为其选择性机制在关键步骤被忽略时会削弱性能。需要解决信息丢失问题，同时保持模型效率。

Method: 提出DMM结构：1）用基于密集层的序列混合器替换Mamba的token mixer；2）修改位置结构以保留局部信息；3）在Mamba前执行全通道同时考虑的序列混合，防止选择性扫描和残差门控导致的信息丢失。

Conclusion: DMM通过改进Mamba的序列混合机制，有效解决了选择性扫描导致的信息丢失问题，为离线强化学习提供了高效且性能优越的解决方案。

Abstract: Mamba-based models have drawn much attention in offline RL. However, their selective mechanism often detrimental when key steps in RL sequences are omitted. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective structure, called Decision MetaMamba (DMM), which replaces Mamba's token mixer with a dense layer-based sequence mixer and modifies positional structure to preserve local information. By performing sequence mixing that considers all channels simultaneously before Mamba, DMM prevents information loss due to selective scanning and residual gating. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DMM delivers the state-of-the-art performance across diverse RL tasks. Furthermore, DMM achieves these results with a compact parameter footprint, demonstrating strong potential for real-world applications.

Abstract: We present a family of generalized Hessian estimators of the objective using random direction stochastic approximation (RDSA) by utilizing only noisy function measurements. The form of each estimator and the order of the bias depend on the number of function measurements. In particular, we demonstrate that estimators with more function measurements exhibit lower-order estimation bias. We show the asymptotic unbiasedness of the estimators. We also perform asymptotic and non-asymptotic convergence analyses for stochastic Newton methods that incorporate our generalized Hessian estimators.

Conclusion: DSDR框架通过解耦和调节推理多样性的全局与局部成分，解决了强化学习验证中的探索瓶颈问题，为LLM推理提供了更强大和稳定的学习信号，代码已开源。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiers (RLVR) is a central paradigm for improving large language model (LLM) reasoning, yet existing methods often suffer from limited exploration. Policies tend to collapse onto a few reasoning patterns and prematurely stop deep exploration, while conventional entropy regularization introduces only local stochasticity and fails to induce meaningful path-level diversity, leading to weak and unstable learning signals in group-based policy optimization. We propose DSDR, a Dual-Scale Diversity Regularization reinforcement learning framework that decomposes diversity in LLM reasoning into global and coupling components. Globally, DSDR promotes diversity among correct reasoning trajectories to explore distinct solution modes. Locally, it applies a length-invariant, token-level entropy regularization restricted to correct trajectories, preventing entropy collapse within each mode while preserving correctness. The two scales are coupled through a global-to-local allocation mechanism that emphasizes local regularization for more distinctive correct trajectories. We provide theoretical support showing that DSDR preserves optimal correctness under bounded regularization, sustains informative learning signals in group-based optimization, and yields a principled global-to-local coupling rule. Experiments on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in accuracy and pass@k, highlighting the importance of dual-scale diversity for deep exploration in RLVR.

Abstract: Mass spectrometry is a powerful and widely used tool for identifying molecular structures due to its sensitivity and ability to profile complex samples. However, translating spectra into full molecular structures is a difficult, under-defined inverse problem. Overcoming this problem is crucial for enabling biological insight, discovering new metabolites, and advancing chemical research across multiple fields. To this end, we develop MSFlow, a two-stage encoder-decoder flow-matching generative model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the structure elucidation task for small molecules. In the first stage, we adopt a formula-restricted transformer model for encoding mass spectra into a continuous and chemically informative embedding space, while in the second stage, we train a decoder flow matching model to reconstruct molecules from latent embeddings of mass spectra. We present ablation studies demonstrating the importance of using information-preserving molecular descriptors for encoding mass spectra and motivate the use of our discrete flow-based decoder. Our rigorous evaluation demonstrates that MSFlow can accurately translate up to 45 percent of molecular mass spectra into their corresponding molecular representations - an improvement of up to fourteen-fold over the current state-of-the-art. A trained version of MSFlow is made publicly available on GitHub for non-commercial users.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting microstructure evolution is fundamental to materials science, as it governs the resulting properties and performance of materials. Traditional simulation methods, such as phase-field models, offer high-fidelity results but are computationally expensive due to the need to solve complex partial differential equations at fine spatiotemporal resolutions. To address this challenge, we propose a deep learning-based framework that accelerates microstructure evolution predictions while maintaining high accuracy. Our approach utilizes a fully convolutional spatiotemporal model trained in a self-supervised manner using sequential images generated from simulations of microstructural processes, including grain growth and spinodal decomposition. The trained neural network effectively learns the underlying physical dynamics and can accurately capture both short-term local behaviors and long-term statistical properties of evolving microstructures, while also demonstrating generalization to unseen spatiotemporal domains and variations in configuration and material parameters. Compared to recurrent neural architectures, our model achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance with significantly reduced computational cost in both training and inference. This work establishes a robust baseline for spatiotemporal learning in materials science and offers a scalable, data-driven alternative for fast and reliable microstructure simulations.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered significant interest due to its safe and easily scalable paradigm. However, training under this paradigm presents its own challenge: the extrapolation error stemming from out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Existing methodologies have endeavored to address this issue through means like penalizing OOD Q-values or imposing similarity constraints on the learned policy and the behavior policy. Nonetheless, these approaches are often beset by limitations such as being overly conservative in utilizing OOD data, imprecise OOD data characterization, and significant computational overhead. To address these challenges, this paper introduces an Uncertainty-Aware Rank-One Multi-Input Multi-Output (MIMO) Q Network framework. The framework aims to enhance Offline Reinforcement Learning by fully leveraging the potential of OOD data while still ensuring efficiency in the learning process. Specifically, the framework quantifies data uncertainty and harnesses it in the training losses, aiming to train a policy that maximizes the lower confidence bound of the corresponding Q-function. Furthermore, a Rank-One MIMO architecture is introduced to model the uncertainty-aware Q-function, \TP{offering the same ability for uncertainty quantification as an ensemble of networks but with a cost nearly equivalent to that of a single network}. Consequently, this framework strikes a harmonious balance between precision, speed, and memory efficiency, culminating in improved overall performance. Extensive experimentation on the D4RL benchmark demonstrates that the framework attains state-of-the-art performance while remaining computationally efficient. By incorporating the concept of uncertainty quantification, our framework offers a promising avenue to alleviate extrapolation errors and enhance the efficiency of offline RL.

Motivation: 在差分隐私联邦学习(DPFL)中微调大型视觉模型(LVMs)和大型语言模型(LLMs)面临隐私-性能的基本权衡问题。传统的LoRA方法在DPFL设置中性能下降明显，存在梯度耦合、噪声放大和参数尖锐化三大挑战。

Method: 提出LA-LoRA方法：1) 采用交替更新策略解耦两个低秩矩阵的梯度交互；2) 对齐不同客户端的更新方向以增强鲁棒性；3) 提供更强的收敛保证理论。

Result: LA-LoRA在Swin Transformer和RoBERTa模型上达到SOTA性能，对DP噪声具有鲁棒性，适用于LVMs和LLMs。在隐私预算ε=1下，Swin-B模型在Tiny-ImageNet数据集上比最佳基线RoLoRA提高16.83%的测试准确率。

Conclusion: LA-LoRA有效解决了DPFL中LoRA的三个关键挑战，在严格的隐私约束下显著提升了模型性能，展示了跨LVMs和LLMs的广泛适用性。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large vision models (LVMs) and large language models (LLMs) under differentially private federated learning (DPFL) is hindered by a fundamental privacy-utility trade-off. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), a promising parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method, reduces computational and communication costs by introducing two trainable low-rank matrices while freezing pre-trained weights. However, directly applying LoRA in DPFL settings leads to performance degradation, especially in LVMs. Our analysis reveals three previously underexplored challenges: (1) gradient coupling caused by the simultaneous update of two asymmetric low-rank matrices, (2) compounded noise amplification under differential privacy, and (3) sharpness of the global aggregated model in the parameter space. To address these issues, we propose LA-LoRA (\textbf{L}ocal \textbf{A}lternating \textbf{LoRA}), a novel approach that decouples gradient interactions and aligns update directions across clients to enhance robustness under stringent privacy constraints. Theoretically, LA-LoRA strengthens convergence guarantees in noisy federated environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LA-LoRA achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on Swin Transformer and RoBERTa models, showcasing robustness to DP noise and broad applicability across both LVMs and LLMs. For example, when fine-tuning the Swin-B model on the Tiny-ImageNet dataset under a strict privacy budget ($ε= 1$), LA-LoRA outperforms the best baseline, RoLoRA, by 16.83\% in test accuracy.

Abstract: Incorporating diffusion-generated synthetic data into adversarial training (AT) has been shown to substantially improve the training of robust image classifiers. In this work, we extend the role of diffusion models beyond merely generating synthetic data, examining whether their internal representations, which encode meaningful features of the data, can provide additional benefits for robust classifier training. Through systematic experiments, we show that diffusion models offer representations that are both diverse and partially robust, and that explicitly incorporating diffusion representations as an auxiliary learning signal during AT consistently improves robustness across settings. Furthermore, our representation analysis indicates that incorporating diffusion models into AT encourages more disentangled features, while diffusion representations and diffusion-generated synthetic data play complementary roles in shaping representations. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet validate these findings, demonstrating the effectiveness of jointly leveraging diffusion representations and synthetic data within AT.

Motivation: 在差分隐私联邦学习中，直接应用AdamW优化器会面临三个主要问题：数据异构和隐私噪声共同放大二阶矩估计的方差、差分隐私扰动导致二阶矩估计有偏、差分隐私加剧AdamW对本地过拟合的敏感性从而恶化客户端漂移。

Conclusion: DP-FedAdamW成功解决了AdamW在差分隐私联邦学习中的三大挑战，实现了收敛效率与隐私保护的平衡，为大规模模型的隐私保护训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Balancing convergence efficiency and robustness under Differential Privacy (DP) is a central challenge in Federated Learning (FL). While AdamW accelerates training and fine-tuning in large-scale models, we find that directly applying it to Differentially Private FL (DPFL) suffers from three major issues: (i) data heterogeneity and privacy noise jointly amplify the variance of second-moment estimator, (ii) DP perturbations bias the second-moment estimator, and (iii) DP amplify AdamW sensitivity to local overfitting, worsening client drift. We propose DP-FedAdamW, the first AdamW-based optimizer for DPFL. It restores AdamW under DP by stabilizing second-moment variance, removing DP-induced bias, and aligning local updates to the global descent to curb client drift. Theoretically, we establish an unbiased second-moment estimator and prove a linearly accelerated convergence rate without any heterogeneity assumption, while providing tighter $(\varepsilon,δ)$-DP guarantees. Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of DP-FedAdamW across language and vision Transformers and ResNet-18. On Tiny-ImageNet (Swin-Base, $\varepsilon=1$), DP-FedAdamW outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 5.83\%. The code is available in Appendix.

Abstract: In reinforcement learning, abstraction methods that remove unnecessary information from the observation are commonly used to learn policies which generalize better to unseen tasks. However, these methods often overlook a crucial weakness: the function which extracts the reduced-information representation has unknown generalization ability in unseen observations. In this paper, we address this problem by presenting an information removal method which more reliably generalizes to new states. We accomplish this by using a learned masking function which operates on, and is integrated with, the attention weights within an attention-based policy network. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves policy generalization to unseen tasks in the Procgen benchmark compared to standard PPO and masking approaches.

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification is central to safe and efficient deployments of deep learning models, yet many computationally practical methods lack lacking rigorous theoretical motivation. Random network distillation (RND) is a lightweight technique that measures novelty via prediction errors against a fixed random target. While empirically effective, it has remained unclear what uncertainties RND measures and how its estimates relate to other approaches, e.g. Bayesian inference or deep ensembles. This paper establishes these missing theoretical connections by analyzing RND within the neural tangent kernel framework in the limit of infinite network width. Our analysis reveals two central findings in this limit: (1) The uncertainty signal from RND -- its squared self-predictive error -- is equivalent to the predictive variance of a deep ensemble. (2) By constructing a specific RND target function, we show that the RND error distribution can be made to mirror the centered posterior predictive distribution of Bayesian inference with wide neural networks. Based on this equivalence, we moreover devise a posterior sampling algorithm that generates i.i.d. samples from an exact Bayesian posterior predictive distribution using this modified \textit{Bayesian RND} model. Collectively, our findings provide a unified theoretical perspective that places RND within the principled frameworks of deep ensembles and Bayesian inference, and offer new avenues for efficient yet theoretically grounded uncertainty quantification methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的PINN在处理带噪声的PDE逆问题时容易受噪声影响，即使少量损坏数据也会严重损害神经表示准确性和训练稳定性。需要增强PINN在噪声环境下的鲁棒性

Method: 首先训练完整数据集的PINN，然后评估联合残差-数据保真度指标划分数据集为可靠和损坏子集，接着引入基于偏差的神经元重要性度量识别噪声敏感神经元，最后采用迭代剪枝策略逐层移除这些神经元并对可靠数据进行微调

Result: 在广泛的PDE逆问题基准测试中，P-PINN显著提高了噪声条件下的鲁棒性、准确性和训练稳定性，相比基线PINN相对误差减少高达96.6%

Conclusion: 基于激活的后验剪枝机制是增强物理信息学习在噪声污染环境中可靠性的有前景方法

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a promising framework for solving inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) by integrating observational data and physical constraints in a unified optimization objective. However, the ill-posed nature of PDE inverse problems makes them highly sensitive to noise. Even a small fraction of corrupted observations can distort internal neural representations, severely impairing accuracy and destabilizing training. Motivated by recent advances in machine unlearning and structured network pruning, we propose P-PINN, a selective pruning framework designed to unlearn the influence of corrupted data in a pretrained PINN. Specifically, starting from a PINN trained on the full dataset, P-PINN evaluates a joint residual--data fidelity indicator, a weighted combination of data misfit and PDE residuals, to partition the training set into reliable and corrupted subsets. Next, we introduce a bias-based neuron importance measure that quantifies directional activation discrepancies between the two subsets, identifying neurons whose representations are predominantly driven by corrupted samples. Building on this, an iterative pruning strategy then removes noise-sensitive neurons layer by layer. The resulting pruned network is fine-tuned on the reliable data subject to the original PDE constraints, acting as a lightweight post-processing stage rather than a complete retraining. Numerical experiments on extensive PDE inverse-problem benchmarks demonstrate that P-PINN substantially improves robustness, accuracy, and training stability under noisy conditions, achieving up to a 96.6\% reduction in relative error compared with baseline PINNs. These results indicate that activation-level post hoc pruning is a promising mechanism for enhancing the reliability of physics-informed learning in noise-contaminated settings.

Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of time-to-event counterfactual survival prediction, aiming to optimize individualized survival outcomes in the presence of heterogeneity and censored data. We propose CURE, a framework that advances counterfactual survival modeling via comprehensive multimodal embedding and latent subgroup retrieval. CURE integrates clinical, paraclinical, demographic, and multi-omics information, which are aligned and fused through cross-attention mechanisms. Complex multi-omics signals can be adaptively refined using a mixture-of-experts architecture, emphasizing the most informative omics components. Building upon this representation, CURE implicitly retrieves patient-specific latent subgroups that capture both baseline survival dynamics and treatment-dependent variations. Experimental results on METABRIC and TCGA-LUAD datasets demonstrate that proposed CURE model consistently outperforms strong baselines in survival analysis, evaluated using the Time-dependent Concordance Index ($C^{td}$) and Integrated Brier Score (IBS). These findings highlight the potential of CURE to enhance multimodal understanding and serve as a foundation for future treatment recommendation models.

Abstract: Distributed Federated Learning (DFL) enables decentralized model training across large-scale systems without a central parameter server. However, DFL faces three critical challenges: privacy leakage from honest-but-curious neighbors, slow convergence due to the lack of central coordination, and vulnerability to Byzantine adversaries aiming to degrade model accuracy. To address these issues, we propose a novel DFL framework that integrates Byzantine robustness, privacy preservation, and convergence acceleration. Within this framework, each device trains a local model using a Bayesian approach and independently selects an optimal subset of neighbors for posterior exchange. We formulate this neighbor selection as an optimization problem to minimize the global loss function under security and privacy constraints. Solving this problem is challenging because devices only possess partial network information, and the complex coupling between topology, security, and convergence remains unclear. To bridge this gap, we first analytically characterize the trade-offs between dynamic connectivity, Byzantine detection, privacy levels, and convergence speed. Leveraging these insights, we develop a fully distributed Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm. This approach enables devices to make autonomous connection decisions based on local observations. Simulation results demonstrate that our method achieves superior robustness and efficiency with significantly lower overhead compared to traditional security and privacy schemes.

Abstract: Dynamic graph anomaly detection (DGAD) is critical for many real-world applications but remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled anomalies. Existing methods are either unsupervised or semi-supervised: unsupervised methods avoid the need for labeled anomalies but often produce ambiguous boundary, whereas semi-supervised methods can overfit to the limited labeled anomalies and generalize poorly to unseen anomalies. To address this gap, we consider a largely underexplored problem in DGAD: learning a discriminative boundary from normal/unlabeled data, while leveraging limited labeled anomalies \textbf{when available} without sacrificing generalization to unseen anomalies. To this end, we propose an effective, generalizable, and model-agnostic framework with three main components: (i) residual representation encoding that capture deviations between current interactions and their historical context, providing anomaly-relevant signals; (ii) a restriction loss that constrain the normal representations within an interval bounded by two co-centered hyperspheres, ensuring consistent scales while keeping anomalies separable; (iii) a bi-boundary optimization strategy that learns a discriminative and robust boundary using the normal log-likelihood distribution modeled by a normalizing flow. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework across diverse evaluation settings.

Abstract: Despite the state-of-the-art performance of large language models (LLMs) across diverse tasks, their susceptibility to adversarial attacks and unsafe content generation remains a major obstacle to deployment, particularly in high-stakes settings. Addressing this challenge requires safety mechanisms that are both practically effective and supported by rigorous theory. We introduce BarrierSteer, a novel framework that formalizes response safety by embedding learned non-linear safety constraints directly into the model's latent representation space. BarrierSteer employs a steering mechanism based on Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to efficiently detect and prevent unsafe response trajectories during inference with high precision. By enforcing multiple safety constraints through efficient constraint merging, without modifying the underlying LLM parameters, BarrierSteer preserves the model's original capabilities and performance. We provide theoretical results establishing that applying CBFs in latent space offers a principled and computationally efficient approach to enforcing safety. Our experiments across multiple models and datasets show that BarrierSteer substantially reduces adversarial success rates, decreases unsafe generations, and outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We study online learning in the adversarial injection model introduced by [Goel et al. 2017], where a stream of labeled examples is predominantly drawn i.i.d.\ from an unknown distribution $\mathcal{D}$, but may be interspersed with adversarially chosen instances without the learner knowing which rounds are adversarial. Crucially, labels are always consistent with a fixed target concept (the clean-label setting). The learner is additionally allowed to abstain from predicting, and the total error counts the mistakes whenever the learner decides to predict and incorrect abstentions when it abstains on i.i.d.\ rounds. Perhaps surprisingly, prior work shows that oracle access to the underlying distribution yields $O(d^2 \log T)$ combined error for VC dimension $d$, while distribution-agnostic algorithms achieve only $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ for restricted classes, leaving open whether this gap is fundamental.
  We resolve this question by proving a matching $Ω(\sqrt{T})$ lower bound for VC dimension $1$, establishing a sharp separation between the two information regimes. On the algorithmic side, we introduce a potential-based framework driven by \emph{robust witnesses}, small subsets of labeled examples that certify predictions while remaining resilient to adversarial contamination. We instantiate this framework using two combinatorial dimensions: (1) \emph{inference dimension}, yielding combined error $\tilde{O}(T^{1-1/k})$ for classes of inference dimension $k$, and (2) \emph{certificate dimension}, a new relaxation we introduce. As an application, we show that halfspaces in $\mathbb{R}^2$ have certificate dimension $3$, obtaining the first distribution-agnostic bound of $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3})$ for this class. This is notable since [Blum et al. 2021] showed halfspaces are not robustly learnable under clean-label attacks without abstention.

Abstract: Current reinforcement learning objectives for large-model reasoning primarily focus on maximizing expected rewards. This paradigm can lead to overfitting to dominant reward signals, while neglecting alternative yet valid reasoning trajectories, thereby limiting diversity and exploration. To address this issue, we introduce Learning Advantage Distributions (LAD), a distribution-matching framework that replaces advantage maximization with learning the advantage-induced distribution. By establishing the equivalence between the optimal policy update and an advantage-based target distribution, we derive a practical LAD objective formulated as minimizing an $f$-divergence between the policy-induced and advantage-induced distributions. This yields a gradient update that increases likelihood for high-advantage responses while suppressing over-confident probability growth, preventing collapse without requiring auxiliary entropy regularization. LAD incurs no extra training cost compared to GRPO and scales naturally to LLM post-training. In a controlled bandit setting, LAD faithfully recovers the multimodal advantage distribution, validating the theoretical formulation. Experiments on math and code reasoning tasks across several LLM backbones show that LAD reliably improves both accuracy and generative diversity.

Abstract: Inspired by behavioral science, we propose Behavior Learning (BL), a novel general-purpose machine learning framework that learns interpretable and identifiable optimization structures from data, ranging from single optimization problems to hierarchical compositions. It unifies predictive performance, intrinsic interpretability, and identifiability, with broad applicability to scientific domains involving optimization. BL parameterizes a compositional utility function built from intrinsically interpretable modular blocks, which induces a data distribution for prediction and generation. Each block represents and can be written in symbolic form as a utility maximization problem (UMP), a foundational paradigm in behavioral science and a universal framework of optimization. BL supports architectures ranging from a single UMP to hierarchical compositions, the latter modeling hierarchical optimization structures. Its smooth and monotone variant (IBL) guarantees identifiability. Theoretically, we establish the universal approximation property of BL, and analyze the M-estimation properties of IBL. Empirically, BL demonstrates strong predictive performance, intrinsic interpretability and scalability to high-dimensional data.

Abstract: This work investigates the bit-error-rate (BER) performance of turbo coded orthogonal frequency division multiplexed - offset quadrature amplitude modulated (OFDM- OQAM) signals transmitted through frequency selective Rayleigh fading channels in the presence of carrier frequency offset (CFO) and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). The highlight of this work is to use the root raised cosine (RRC) pulse and its Hilbert transform as the complex-valued transmit filter and a simple matched filter at the receiver. The proposed system is similar to single sideband (SSB) modulation, that has roots in analog communications. Turbo code and subcarrier diversity is employed to improve the BER performance over that of an uncoded system. Discrete-time algorithms for frame detection, two-step CFO, channel and noise variance estimation have been proposed. A single transmit and receive antenna is assumed. Similar work has not been done earlier.

Abstract: We introduce derivation depth-a computable metric of the reasoning effort needed to answer a query based on a given set of premises. We model information as a two-layered structure linking abstract knowledge with physical carriers, and separate essential core facts from operational shortcuts. For any finite premise base, we define and prove the computability of derivation depth. By encoding reasoning traces and applying information-theoretic incompressibility arguments, we establish fundamental bounds linking depth to the descriptive complexity of queries. For frequently asked, information-rich queries, the minimal description length grows proportionally to depth times the logarithm of the knowledge base size. This leads to a practical storage-computation tradeoff: queries accessed beyond a critical threshold become cheaper to cache than recompute. We formulate optimal cache allocation as a mathematical optimization problem solvable with approximation guarantees and extend the framework to handle noisy or incomplete knowledge bases.

Abstract: Microwave linear analog computer (MiLAC) has emerged as a promising architecture for implementing linear multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) processing in the analog domain, with radio frequency (RF) signals. Existing studies on MiLAC-aided communications rely on idealized channel models and neglect antenna mutual coupling. However, since MiLAC performs processing at RF, mutual coupling becomes critical and alters the implemented operation, not only the channel characteristics. In this paper, we develop a physics-compliant model for MiLAC-aided MIMO systems accounting for mutual coupling with multiport network theory. We derive end-to-end system models for scenarios with MiLACs at the transmitter, the receiver, or both, showing how mutual coupling impacts the linear transformation implemented by the MiLACs. Furthermore, we formulate and solve a mutual coupling aware MiLAC optimization problem, deriving a closed-form globally optimal solution that maximizes the received signal power. We establish the fundamental performance limits of MiLAC with mutual coupling, and derive three analytical results. First, mutual coupling is beneficial in MiLAC-aided systems, on average. Second, with mutual coupling, MiLAC performs as digital architectures equipped with a matching network, while having fewer RF chains. Third, with mutual coupling, MiLAC always outperforms digital architectures with no matching network. Numerical simulations confirm our theoretical findings.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Conventional-antenna-based multi-cell interference management can lead to excessive power consumption. For example, in order to serve those users which are close to the cell edge, base stations often must transmit at very high power levels to overcome severe large-scale path-loss, i.e., the base stations have to ``shout" at the users to realize the users' target quality of service (QoS). This letter focuses on the application of pinching antennas to multi-cell interference management and demonstrates that the use of multi-cell pinching-antenna transmission leads to a quiet wireless world. In particular, each transceiver pair can be positioned in close proximity, and hence the users' QoS requirements can be met with only low transmit power, i.e., via ``whispering" rather than high-power transmission.

Abstract: Assessing whether two datasets are distributionally consistent has become a central theme in modern scientific analysis, particularly as generative artificial intelligence is increasingly used to produce synthetic datasets whose fidelity must be rigorously validated against the original data on which they are trained, a task made more challenging by the continued growth in data volume and problem dimensionality. In this work, we propose the use of arithmetic coding to provide a lossless and invertible compression of datasets under a physics-informed probabilistic representation. Datasets that share the same underlying physical correlations admit comparable optimal descriptions, while discrepancies in those correlations-arising from miscalibration, mismodeling, or bias-manifest as an irreducible excess in code length. This excess codelength defines an operational fidelity metric, quantified directly in bits through differences in achievable compression length relative to a physics-inspired reference distribution. We demonstrate that this metric is global, interpretable, additive across components, and asymptotically optimal in the Shannon sense. Moreover, we show that differences in codelength correspond to differences in expected negative log-likelihood evaluated under the same physics-informed reference model. As a byproduct, we also demonstrate that our compression approach achieves a higher compression ratio than traditional general-purpose algorithms such as gzip. Our results establish lossless, physics-aware compression based on arithmetic coding not as an end in itself, but as a measurement instrument for testing the fidelity between datasets.

Result: 在alice29.txt上达到0.918 bpb，超越gzip 3.1倍、bzip2 2.5倍；在enwik8上达到0.9389 bpb，比ts_zip和FineZip分别提升15%和8%；在训练集外文档上仍保持0.723 bpb的高压缩率。

Conclusion: Nacrith证明了即使使用较小模型（相对于FineZip小60倍且无需微调），通过精心设计的系统优化仍能实现超越现有方法的压缩性能，为神经压缩的实际应用提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We present Nacrith, a lossless compression system that combines a 135M-parameter transformer language model (SmolLM2-135M) with an ensemble of lightweight online predictors and a 32-bit arithmetic coder. Beyond the base LLM-plus-arithmetic-coding paradigm, Nacrith introduces several contributions: (1) a CDF precision upgrade from 2^16 to 2^24 that eliminates ~75% of quantization overhead caused by minimum-probability floors in large vocabularies; (2) a token-level N-gram model for fast local predictions; (3) an adaptive log-space bias head correcting per-document LLM errors via online gradient descent; (4) confidence-based LLM skip for accelerating highly predictable tokens; (5) a hybrid binary format (NC06) extending neural compression to arbitrary binary files--to our knowledge a first among LLM-based compressors; (6) a llama.cpp inference backend achieving ~7x faster single-token decode than PyTorch; (7) parallel multi-GPU compression across up to 8 workers; and (8) native KV cache sliding window reducing per-slide cost by ~37x. The system requires only ~500 MB of GGUF weights and ~1.2 GB VRAM per worker, running on consumer GPUs.
  On alice29.txt (Canterbury Corpus, 152 KB), Nacrith achieves 0.918 bits per byte (bpb)--outperforming gzip by 3.1x, bzip2 by 2.5x, CMIX v21 by 44%, and ts_zip by 20%, while compressing below the 0th-, 1st-, and 2nd-order byte-level Shannon entropy bounds. On enwik8 (100 MB), Nacrith achieves 0.9389 bpb (11.74%), surpassing ts_zip (~1.11 bpb) by 15% and FineZip (1.024 bpb) by 8% despite using a 60x smaller model with no fine-tuning. An out-of-distribution evaluation on a document published after the model's training cutoff confirms these gains are not memorization artifacts, achieving 0.723 bpb on unseen text.

Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks are progressing beyond conventional connectivity to incorporate emerging sensing and computing capabilities. This convergence gives rise to integrated systems that enable not only uninterrupted communication, but also environmental awareness, intelligent decision-making, and novel applications that take advantage of these combined features. At the same time, this integration brings substantial security challenges. As computing, sensing, and communication become more tightly intertwined, the overall complexity of the system increases, creating new vulnerabilities and expanding the attack surface. The widespread deployment of data-heavy artificial intelligence applications further amplifies concerns regarding data security and privacy. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of security and privacy threats, along with potential countermeasures, in integrated wireless systems. We first review physical-layer security techniques for communication networks, and then investigate the security and privacy implications of semantic and pragmatic communications and their associated cross-layer design methodologies. For sensing functionalities, we pinpoint security and privacy risks at the levels of signal sources, propagation channels, and sensing targets, and summarize state-of-the-art defense strategies for each. The growing computational requirements of these applications drive the need for distributed computing over the network, which introduces additional risks such as data leakage, weak authentication, and multiple points of failure. We subsequently discuss secure coded computing approaches that can help overcome several of these challenges. Finally, we introduce unified security frameworks tailored to integrated communication-sensing-computing architectures, offering an end-to-end perspective on protecting future wireless systems.

Abstract: Enormous fluid antenna systems (E-FAS) have recently emerged as a new wireless architecture in which intelligent metasurfaces act as guided electromagnetic interfaces, enabling surface-wave (SW) propagation with much lower attenuation and more control than conventional space-wave transmission. While prior work has reported substantial power gains under perfect channel state information (CSI), the impact of practical channel acquisition on E-FAS performance remains largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive analysis of E-FAS-assisted downlink transmission under pilot-based channel estimation. We develop an estimation framework for the equivalent end-to-end channel and derive closed-form expressions for the statistics of the minimum mean-square-error (MMSE) channel estimate and its estimation error. Building on these results, we analyze both single-user and multiuser operation while explicitly accounting for the training overhead. For the single-user case, we characterize the outage probability and achievable rate with imperfect CSI, and reveal an inherent signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) saturation phenomenon caused by residual self-interference. For the multiuser case, we study zero-forcing (ZF) precoding based on imperfect channel estimates and show that the system becomes interference-limited in the high SNR regime because of residual inter-user interference. Furthermore, we quantify the trade-off between spatial multiplexing gains and pilot overhead when the number of users increases. Analytical findings are validated via Monte Carlo simulations and benchmarked against least-squares (LS) estimation and conventional non-E-FAS transmission. The results reveal that despite CSI imperfections and training costs, E-FAS retains substantial performance advantages and provides robustness enabled by its amplified large-scale channel gain.

Abstract: Task-oriented Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) networks have recently been proposed to scalably support the large-scale deployment of connected vehicles within the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) vision. In task-oriented V2X networks, vehicles select the content of the transmitted messages based on its relevance to the intended receivers. However, relevance estimation can be quite challenging, especially in highly dynamic and complex vehicular scenarios. Relevance estimation errors can cause a vehicle to omit relevant information from its transmitted message, leading to a content-selection error. Content-selection errors reduce the amount of relevant information available at the receivers and can potentially impair their situational awareness. This work analyses the impact of content-selection errors on task-oriented V2X networks. Our analysis reveals that task-oriented V2X networks feature an inherent resilience to content-selection errors that guarantees a consistent delivery of relevant information even under high relevance estimation error conditions. Moreover, we identify the fundamental conditions underpinning such inherent resilience. These conditions can be encountered in other task-oriented networks where multiple transmitters select the content of their messages based on the task-related requirements of a common set of intended receivers.

Motivation: 移动设备调度需要隐私信息（如移动轨迹、位置、信道状态），但传统调度器会暴露这些数据。本文旨在在保护隐私前提下实现高效的传输调度。

Method: 使用实时联邦优化框架：1）仅与数字孪生进行迭代交互获得全局分数解；2）采用依赖舍入将分数解转为实际信道传输调度。

Result: 实验显示调度时间显著减少，带宽/能量违反接近零，端到端运行时在毫秒级别。

Conclusion: 首次实现完全不暴露隐私数据的跨数字孪生信道共享框架，有效平衡调度性能与隐私保护需求。

Abstract: A Digital Twin (DT) may protect information that is considered private to its associated physical system. For a mobile device, this may include its mobility profile, recent location(s), and experienced channel conditions. Online schedulers, however, typically use this type of information to perform tasks such as shared bandwidth and channel time slot assignments. In this paper, we consider three transmission scheduling problems with energy constraints, where such information is needed, and yet must remain private: minimizing total transmission time when (i) fixed-power or (ii) fixed-rate time slotting with power control is used, and (iii) maximizing the amount of data uploaded in a fixed time period. Using a real-time federated optimization framework, we show how the scheduler can iteratively interact only with the DTs to produce global fractional solutions to these problems, without the latter revealing their private information. Then dependent rounding is used to round the fractional solution into a channel transmission schedule for the physical systems. Experiments show consistent makespan reductions with near-zero bandwidth/energy violations and millisecond-order end-to-end runtime for typical edge server hardware. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework that enables channel sharing across DTs using operations that do not expose private data.

Abstract: Underwater localization is essential for marine exploration and autonomous underwater operations, yet existing radio frequency and optical approaches are limited by rapid attenuation or limited visibility. Acoustic sensing remains the most practical choice, but conventional acoustic systems typically rely on large arrays or multiple synchronized anchors, resulting in high hardware costs and complex deployment. This paper introduces a novel low-cost passive acoustic metasurface, MetaBlue , explicitly designed for underwater localization, which, when attached to an ordinary ultrasonic transmitter, transforms it into a directional "super-transmitter." The metasurface embeds direction-dependent spectral patterns into the transmitted waveform, enabling accurate angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation using only a single hydrophone. For ranging, we present a new EM-acoustic mixed time-of-arrival (ToA) method that leverages the acoustic transducer's inherent low-frequency EM leakage as a timing reference, enabling precise ranging without shared clocks. This allows complete 3D localization with a single low-cost anchor. We evaluate the system across diverse real-world underwater settings, including pools, tanks, and outdoor environments. Experiments show that our design achieves an average AoA error of 8.7 degree and 3D localization error of 0.37 m at distances over 10 m. Even with a single anchor, the system maintains 0.73 m precision.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large AI models imposes stringent demands on data volume and computational resources. Federated learning, though designed to exploit distributed data and computational resources, faces data shortage from limited network coverage and computational constraints from edge devices. To address these issues, both the mixture-of-experts (MoE) and satellite-terrestrial network (STN) provide promising solutions, offering lightweight computation overhead and broad coverage, respectively. However, the satellite-ground relative motion results in intermittent connectivity, hindering conventional federated learning that relies on model synchronization across devices. To leverage the coverage of STN while preserving training efficiency, we propose EMS-FL, an expert-driven model splitting and federated learning method. EMS-FL assigns each device cluster only the experts highly correlated to their local data. Through non-overlapping expert assignments, asynchronous local learning is further proposed, where each device cluster trains its assigned experts consecutively and only uploads local parameters to the satellite during connected phases for aggregation and model updates. Consequently, EMS-FL effectively reduces the training overhead and achieves both faster convergence and higher accuracy compared with conventional federated learning. Rigorous convergence analysis is provided to theoretically characterize the learning performance. Furthermore, comprehensive experiments are conducted using public datasets and large models, validating the superiority of EMS-FL.

Abstract: Low-diameter topologies such as Dragonfly and Slim Fly are increasingly adopted in HPC and datacenter networks, yet existing load balancing techniques either rely on proprietary in-network mechanisms or fail to utilize the full path diversity of these topologies. We introduce Spritz, a flexible sender-based load balancing framework that shifts adaptive topology-aware routing to the endpoints using only standard Ethernet features. We propose two algorithms, Spritz-Scout and Spritz-Spray that, respectively, explore and adaptively cache efficient paths using ECN, packet trimming, and timeout feedback. Through simulation on Dragonfly and Slim Fly topologies with over 1000 endpoints, Spritz outperforms ECMP, UGAL-L, and prior sender-based approaches by up to 1.8x in flow completion time under AI training and datacenter workloads, while offering robust failover with performance improvements of up to 25.4x under link failures, all without additional hardware support. Spritz enables datacenter-scale, commodity Ethernet networks to efficiently leverage low-diameter topologies, offering unified routing and load balancing for the Ultra Ethernet era.

Abstract: Interoperability across industrial automation systems is a cornerstone of Industry 4.0. To address this need, the OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) Publish-Subscribe (PubSub) model offers a promising mechanism for enabling efficient communication among heterogeneous devices. PubSub facilitates resource sharing and communication configuration between devices, but it lacks clear guidelines for mapping diverse industrial traffic types to appropriate PubSub configurations. This gap can lead to misconfigurations that degrade network performance and compromise real-time requirements. This paper proposes a set of guidelines for mapping industrial traffic types, based on their timing and quality-of-service specifications, to OPC UA PubSub configurations. The goal is to ensure predictable communication and support real-time performance in industrial networks. The proposed guidelines are evaluated through an industrial use case that demonstrates the impact of incorrect configuration on latency and throughput. The results underline the importance of traffic-aware PubSub configuration for achieving interoperability in Industry 4.0 systems.

Abstract: For low-altitude economy (LAE), fast and accurate beam prediction between high-mobility unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and ground base stations is of paramount importance, which ensures seamless coverage and reliable communications. However, existing deep learning-based beam prediction methods lack high-level semantic understanding of dynamic environments, resulting in poor generalization. On the other hand, the emerging large language model (LLM) based approaches show promise in enhancing generalization, but they typically lack rich environmental perception, thereby failing to capture fine-grained spatial semantics essential for precise beam alignment. To tackle these limitations, we propose in this correspondence a novel end-to-end generative framework for beam prediction, called BeamVLM, which treats beam prediction as a vision question answering task capitalizing on powerful existing vision-language models (VLMs). By projecting raw visual patches directly into the language domain and judiciously designing an instructional prompt, the proposed BeamVLM enables the VLM to jointly reason over UAV trajectories and environmental context. Last, experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed BeamVLM outperforms state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy and also exhibits superior generalization for other scenarios such as vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) beam prediction.

Motivation: 生成模型在医学影像重建中应用日益广泛，但已知会产生幻觉问题，可能插入原始图像中不存在的特征，危及患者健康。研究人员旨在量化最先进的生成模型在MRI重建中的幻觉程度。

Method: 研究在fastMRI数据集的脑部和膝部图像上，对未处理的输入图像创建类似随机噪声的对抗性扰动，这些扰动能诱导生成模型在重建时产生幻觉。使用了UNet和端到端VarNet架构进行图像重建。

Conclusion: 生成模型的脆弱性可能部分解释了为什么会产生幻觉，需要进行精心设计的对抗性训练来减少其发生。需要开发新方法来检测幻觉的发生。

Abstract: Generative models are increasingly used to improve the quality of medical imaging, such as reconstruction of magnetic resonance images and computed tomography. However, it is well-known that such models are susceptible to hallucinations: they may insert features into the reconstructed image which are not actually present in the original image. In a medical setting, such hallucinations may endanger patient health as they can lead to incorrect diagnoses. In this work, we aim to quantify the extent to which state-of-the-art generative models suffer from hallucinations in the context of magnetic resonance image reconstruction. Specifically, we craft adversarial perturbations resembling random noise for the unprocessed input images which induce hallucinations when reconstructed using a generative model. We perform this evaluation on the brain and knee images from the fastMRI data set using UNet and end-to-end VarNet architectures to reconstruct the images. Our results show that these models are highly susceptible to small perturbations and can be easily coaxed into producing hallucinations. This fragility may partially explain why hallucinations occur in the first place and suggests that a carefully constructed adversarial training routine may reduce their prevalence. Moreover, these hallucinations cannot be reliably detected using traditional image quality metrics. Novel approaches will therefore need to be developed to detect when hallucinations have occurred.

Abstract: Transcranial ultrasound imaging is limited by high skull absorption, limiting vascular imaging to only the largest vessels. Traditional clutter filters struggle with low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ultrasound datasets, where blood and tissue signals cannot be easily separated, even when the echogenicity of the blood is improved with contrast agents. Here, we present a novel 4D U-Net approach for clutter filtering in transcranial 3D Contrast Enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS) exploiting spatial and temporal information via a 4D-UNet implementation to enhance microbubble detection in transcranial data acquired in human adults. Our results show that the 4D-UNet improves temporal clutter filters. By integrating deep learning into CEUS, this study advances neurovascular imaging, offering improved clutter rejection and visualization. The findings underscore the potential of AI-driven approaches to enhance ultrasound-based medical imaging, paving the way for more accurate diagnostics and broader clinical applications.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful priors for solving inverse problems. While computed tomography (CT) is theoretically a linear inverse problem, it poses many practical challenges. These include correlated noise, artifact structures, reliance on system geometry, and misaligned value ranges, which make the direct application of diffusion models more difficult than in domains like natural image generation. To systematically evaluate how diffusion models perform in this context and compare them with established reconstruction methods, we introduce DM4CT, a comprehensive benchmark for CT reconstruction. DM4CT includes datasets from both medical and industrial domains with sparse-view and noisy configurations. To explore the challenges of deploying diffusion models in practice, we additionally acquire a high-resolution CT dataset at a high-energy synchrotron facility and evaluate all methods under real experimental conditions. We benchmark ten recent diffusion-based methods alongside seven strong baselines, including model-based, unsupervised, and supervised approaches. Our analysis provides detailed insights into the behavior, strengths, and limitations of diffusion models for CT reconstruction. The real-world dataset is publicly available at zenodo.org/records/15420527, and the codebase is open-sourced at github.com/DM4CT/DM4CT.

Abstract: Camera recapture introduces complex optical degradations, such as perspective warping, illumination shifts, and Moiré interference, that remain challenging for deep watermarking systems. We present TIACam, a text-anchored invariant feature learning framework with auto-augmentation for camera-robust zero-watermarking. The method integrates three key innovations: (1) a learnable auto-augmentor that discovers camera-like distortions through differentiable geometric, photometric, and Moiré operators; (2) a text-anchored invariant feature learner that enforces semantic consistency via cross-modal adversarial alignment between image and text; and (3) a zero-watermarking head that binds binary messages in the invariant feature space without modifying image pixels. This unified formulation jointly optimizes invariance, semantic alignment, and watermark recoverability. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world camera captures demonstrate that TIACam achieves state-of-the-art feature stability and watermark extraction accuracy, establishing a principled bridge between multimodal invariance learning and physically robust zero-watermarking.

Abstract: Machine-learning models working on skin images often have degraded performance when the skin colour captured in images (SCCI) differs between training and deployment. Such differences arise from entangled environmental factors (e.g., illumination, camera settings), and intrinsic factors (e.g., skin tone) that cannot be accurately described by a single "skin tone" scalar. To mitigate such colour mismatch, we propose a skin-colour disentangling framework that adapts disentanglement-by-compression to learn a structured, manipulable latent space for SCCI from unlabelled dermatology images. To prevent information leakage that hinders proper learning of dark colour features, we introduce a randomized, mostly monotonic decolourization mapping. To suppress unintended colour shifts of localized patterns (e.g., ink marks, scars) during colour manipulation, we further propose a geometry-aligned post-processing step. Together, these components enable faithful counterfactual editing and answering an essential question: "What would this skin condition look like under a different SCCI?", as well as direct colour transfer between images and controlled traversal along physically meaningful directions (e.g., blood perfusion, camera white balance), enabling educational visualization of skin conditions under varying SCCI. We demonstrate that dataset-level augmentation and colour normalization based on our framework achieve competitive lesion classification performance.

Abstract: While deep learning has demonstrated considerable promise in computer-aided diagnosis for pulmonary embolism (PE), practical deployment in Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiography (CTPA) is often hindered by "domain shift" and the prohibitive cost of expert annotations. To address these challenges, an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) framework is proposed, utilizing a Transformer backbone and a Mean-Teacher architecture for cross-center semantic segmentation. The primary focus is placed on enhancing pseudo-label reliability by learning deep structural information within the feature space. Specifically, three modules are integrated and designed for this task: (1) a Prototype Alignment (PA) mechanism to reduce category-level distribution discrepancies; (2) Global and Local Contrastive Learning (GLCL) to capture both pixel-level topological relationships and global semantic representations; and (3) an Attention-based Auxiliary Local Prediction (AALP) module designed to reinforce sensitivity to small PE lesions by automatically extracting high-information slices from Transformer attention maps. Experimental validation conducted on cross-center datasets (FUMPE and CAD-PE) demonstrates significant performance gains. In the FUMPE -> CAD-PE task, the IoU increased from 0.1152 to 0.4153, while the CAD-PE -> FUMPE task saw an improvement from 0.1705 to 0.4302. Furthermore, the proposed method achieved a 69.9% Dice score in the CT -> MRI cross-modality task on the MMWHS dataset without utilizing any target-domain labels for model selection, confirming its robustness and generalizability for diverse clinical environments.

Abstract: Electricity market design that accounts for grid constraints such as voltage and thermal limits at the distribution level can increase opportunities for the grid integration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs). In this paper, we consider rooftop solar backed by battery storage connected to a distribution grid. We design an electricity market to support customers sharing rooftop generation in excess of their energy demand, where customers earn a profit through peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading. Our proposed electricity market also incorporates P2P reactive power trading to improve the voltage profile across a distribution feeder. We formulate the electricity market as an optimization-based problem, where voltage and thermal limits across a feeder are managed through the assignment of customer-specific dynamic operating envelopes (DOEs). The electricity market equilibrium is referred to as a competitive equilibrium, which is equivalent to a Nash equilibrium in a standard game. Our proposed market design is benchmarked using the IEEE 13-node test feeder.

Method: 设计了每个智能体的策略剖面估计机制，基于对估计的最佳响应策略建立所有智能体的策略动态系统。对于多步延迟，采用李雅普诺夫-克拉索夫斯基泛函法分析稳定性；对于一步延迟，通过限制学习率范围来保证指数收敛。

Result: 在多步延迟信息交换下，策略动态系统渐进收敛到纳什均衡；在一步延迟信息交换下，当学习率小于上界时可保证指数收敛，同时给出了导致不稳定的学习率下界。

Conclusion: 研究成功将最佳响应算法扩展到延迟信息设置，为分布式非合作博弈中的纳什均衡求解提供了理论保证和实用条件限制。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the seeking of Nash equilibrium (NE) in a non-cooperative quadratic game where all agents exchange their delayed strategy information with their neighbors. To extend best-response algorithms to the delayed information setting, an estimation mechanism for each agent to estimate the current strategy profile is designed. Based on the best-response strategy to the estimations, the strategy profile dynamics of all agents is established, which is revealed to converge asymptotically to the NE when agents exchange multi-step-delay information via the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional approach. In the scenario where agents exchange one-step-delay information, the exponential convergence of the strategy profile dynamics to the NE can be guaranteed by restricting the learning rate to less than an upper bound. Moreover, a lower bound on the learning rate for instability of the NE is proposed. Numerical simulations are provided for verifying the developed results.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) framework to design data-driven policy gradient descent algorithms for the linear quadratic regulator problem. Two alternative schemes are considered to estimate the policy gradient from stochastic trajectory data: (i) an indirect online identification based approach, in which the system matrices are first estimated and subsequently used to construct the gradient, and (ii) a direct zeroth-order approach, which approximates the gradient using empirical cost evaluations. In both cases, the resulting gradient estimates are random due to stochasticity in the data, allowing us to use SGD theory to analyze the convergence of the associated policy gradient methods. A key technical step consists of modeling the gradient estimates as suitable stochastic gradient oracles, which, because of the way they are computed, are inherently based. We derive sufficient conditions under which SGD with a biased gradient oracle converges asymptotically to the optimal policy, and leverage these conditions to design the parameters of the gradient estimation schemes. Moreover, we compare the advantages and limitations of the two data-driven gradient estimators. Numerical experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Abstract: In the presence of uncertainties in load, generation, and network topology, power system planning must reflect operational conditions, while operations require situational awareness over credible uncertainty sets. Existing methods screen, analyze, embed, and propagate uncertainty in power flow and optimal power flow settings, but provide only partial insight into how physical constraints, controls, and economic interactions shape steady-state operating-point robustness. By formulating operating-point robustness as a post-solution physical response problem around a solved AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) equilibrium, this paper presents a unified framework for assessing robustness under injection and topological uncertainty without re-optimization. We construct a primal physical response mapping that accounts for connectivity changes, active power redistribution, generator saturation including $PV \rightarrow PQ$ transitions, and AC network propagation, and introduce quasi-duals that provide a geometric interpretation of shadow prices for off-optimal equilibria. Using these mappings, we develop deterministic screening procedures that generalize $N-k$ contingency analysis to include cost vulnerability $C-k$, and local analogs $N+δ(k)$ and $C+δ(k)$ defined through sensitivity-normalized margins and risk tolerances. The framework is extended to probabilistic screening for distribution- and moment-based uncertainties, with sequentially-pruned mixture modeling and $α$-stressed regime constructions to manage combinatorial branching. A case study on the Puerto Rican bulk power system demonstrates integration with geospatial data to enhance operational and planning awareness.

Abstract: Spatially distributed cavity (SDC) lasers are a promising technology for simultaneous light information and power transfer (SLIPT), offering benefits such as increased mobility and intrinsic safety, which are advantageous for various Internet of Things (IoT) devices. \mll However, achieving beam transmission over meter-level long working distances presents significant challenges from cavity stability constraints, manufacturing/assembly tolerances, and diffraction losses\mrr. This paper conducts a theoretical investigation of the fundamental restrictions limiting long-range resonant beam generation. We investigate cavity stability and beam characteristics, and propose a binary-search-based Monte Carlo simulation algorithm as well as a linear approximation algorithm to quantify the maximum acceptable tolerances for stable operation. \mll Numerical results indicate that the stable region contracts sharply as distance increases. For fixed-component systems, an acceptable tolerance of 0.01 mm restricts the achievable transmission distance to less than 2 m. \mrr To address this limitation, we also prove the feasibility of long-range beam formation using precision adjustable elements, paving the way for advanced engineering applications. \mll Experimental results verified this assumption, demonstrating that by tuning the stable region during assembly, the transmission distance could be extended to 2.8 m. \mrr This work provides essential theoretical insights and practical design guidelines for realizing stable, long-range SDC systems.

Abstract: We study how to scale distributed bandit submodular coordination under realistic communication constraints in bandwidth, data rate, and connectivity. We are motivated by multi-agent tasks of active situational awareness in unknown, partially-observable, and resource-limited environments, where the agents must coordinate through agent-to-agent communication. Our approach enables scalability by (i) limiting information relays to only one-hop communication and (ii) keeping inter-agent messages small, having each agent transmit only its own action information. Despite these information-access restrictions, our approach enables near-optimal action coordination by optimizing the agents' communication neighborhoods over time, through distributed online bandit optimization, subject to the agents' bandwidth constraints. Particularly, our approach enjoys an anytime suboptimality bound that is also strictly positive for arbitrary network topologies, even disconnected. To prove the bound, we define the Value of Coordination (VoC), an information-theoretic metric that quantifies for each agent the benefit of information access to its neighbors. We validate in simulations the scalability and near-optimality of our approach: it is observed to converge faster, outperform benchmarks for bandit submodular coordination, and can even outperform benchmarks that are privileged with a priori knowledge of the environment.

Abstract: The growing deployment of nonlinear, converter interfaced distributed energy resources (DERs) in DC microgrids demands decentralized controllers that remain stable and resilient under a wide range of cyber-physical attacks and disturbances. Traditional droop or linearized control methods lack resilience and scalability, especially when the system operates in its nonlinear region or faces diverse false-data-injection (FDI) attacks on control inputs. In this work, we develop a Decentralized Attack-Resilient Control Lyapunov Function (AR-CLF) based Quadratic Program (QP) control framework for nonlinear DC microgrids that ensures large-signal stability in a fully decentralized manner. Built upon the port-Hamiltonian representation, the proposed controller dynamically compensates diverse attacks including exponentially unbounded control-input perturbations beyond the bounded-attack regime commonly assumed in existing methods, through an adaptive resilience term, without requiring global information. Simulations validate that the AR-CLF based QP controller achieves superior stability and resilience against unbounded attacks, paving the way for scalable, attack-resilient, and physically consistent control of next-generation DC microgrids.

Abstract: Transmission expansion planning in electricity markets is tightly coupled with the strategic bidding behaviors of generation companies. This paper proposes a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based co-optimization framework that simultaneously learns transmission investment decisions and generator bidding strategies within a unified training process. Based on a multiagent RL framework for market simulation, the proposed method newly introduces a design policy layer that jointly optimizes continuous/discrete transmission expansion decisions together with strategic bidding policies. Through iterative interaction between market clearing and investment design, the framework effectively captures their mutual influence and achieves consistent co-optimization of expansion and bidding decisions. Case studies on the IEEE 30-bus system are provided for proof-of-concept validation of the proposed co-optimization framework.

Abstract: We present AgentOptics, an agentic AI framework for high-fidelity, autonomous optical system control built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP). AgentOptics interprets natural language tasks and executes protocol-compliant actions on heterogeneous optical devices through a structured tool abstraction layer. We implement 64 standardized MCP tools across 8 representative optical devices and construct a 410-task benchmark to evaluate request understanding, role-aware responses, multi-step coordination, robustness to linguistic variation, and error handling. We assess two deployment configurations--commercial online LLMs and locally hosted open-source LLMs--and compare them with LLM-based code generation baselines. AgentOptics achieves 87.7%--99.0% average task success rates, significantly outperforming code-generation approaches, which reach up to 50% success. We further demonstrate broader applicability through five case studies extending beyond device-level control to system orchestration, monitoring, and closed-loop optimization. These include DWDM link provisioning and coordinated monitoring of coherent 400 GbE and analog radio-over-fiber (ARoF) channels; autonomous characterization and bias optimization of a wideband ARoF link carrying 5G fronthaul traffic; multi-span channel provisioning with launch power optimization; closed-loop fiber polarization stabilization; and distributed acoustic sensing (DAS)-based fiber monitoring with LLM-assisted event detection. These results establish AgentOptics as a scalable, robust paradigm for autonomous control and orchestration of heterogeneous optical systems.

Abstract: Power system operators are increasingly deploying Grid Enhancing Technologies (GETs) to mitigate operational challenges such as line and transformer congestion, and voltage violations. These technologies, including Network Topology Optimization (NTO), Variable Impedance Devices (VIDs), and Dynamic Line Rating (DLR), enhance system flexibility and enable better utilization of existing network assets. However, as the deployment of multiple GETs grows, effective coordination among them becomes essential to fully realize their potential benefits. This paper presents a co-optimization framework that models and coordinates NTO, VID, and DLR within a unified optimization scheme to alleviate network congestion and minimize operational costs. The NTO formulation is developed using a node-breaker model, offering finer switching granularity and improved operational flexibility. The inclusion of VIDs introduces nonlinear and non-convex relationships in the optimization problem. DLR takes into account of weather conditions, primarily wind speed and ambient temperature, enabling adaptive utilization of transmission capacity. The proposed framework is validated on standard IEEE benchmark test systems, demonstrating its effectiveness under varying numbers and placements of impedance controllers.

Abstract: Living organisms rely on endogenous feedback mechanisms to maintain homeostasis in the presence of uncertainty and environmental fluctuations. An emerging challenge at the interface of control systems engineering and synthetic biology is the design of reliable feedback strategies to regulate cellular behavior and collective biological functions. In this article, we review recent advances in multicellular feedback control, where sensing, computation, and actuation are distributed across different cell populations within synthetic microbial consortia, giving rise to biological multiagent control systems governed by molecular communication. From a control-theoretic perspective, these consortia can be interpreted as distributed biomolecular control systems, where coordination among populations replace embedded regulation. We survey theoretical frameworks, control architectures, and modeling approaches, ranging from aggregate population-level dynamics to spatially aware agent-based simulations, and discuss experimental demonstrations in engineered \textit{Escherichia coli} consortia. We highlight how distributing control functions across populations can reduce metabolic burden, mitigate retroactivity, improve robustness to uncertainty, and enable modular reuse of control components. Beyond regulation of gene expression, we discuss the emerging problem of population composition control, where coordination among growing and competing cell populations becomes an integral part of the control objective. Finally, we outline key open challenges that must be addressed before multicellular control strategies can be deployed in real-world applications such as biomanufacturing, environmental remediation, and therapeutic systems. These challenges span modeling and simulation, experimental platform development, coordination and composition control, and long-term evolutionary stability.

Abstract: The Low-Altitude Economy (LAE) is rapidly emerging as a new technological and industrial frontier, with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, and aerial swarms increasingly deployed in logistics, infrastructure inspection, security, and emergency response. However, the large-scale development of the LAE demands a reliable aerial foundation that ensures not only real-time connectivity and computational support, but also navigation integrity and safe airspace management for safety-critical operations. High-Altitude Platforms (HAPs), positioned at around 20 km, provide a unique balance between wide-area coverage and low-latency responsiveness. Compared with low earth orbit (LEO) satellites, HAPs are closer to end users and thus capable of delivering millisecond-level connectivity, fine-grained regulatory oversight, and powerful onboard computing and caching resources. Beyond connectivity and computation, HAPs-assisted sensing and regulation further enable navigation integrity and airspace trust, which are essential for safety-critical UAV and eVTOL operations in the LAE. This article proposes a five-stage evolutionary roadmap for HAPs in the LAE: from serving as aerial infrastructure bases, to becoming super back-ends for UAV, to acting as frontline support for ground users, further enabling swarm-scale UAV coordination, and ultimately advancing toward edge-air-cloud closed-loop autonomy. In parallel, HAPs complement LEO satellites and cloud infrastructures to form a global-regional-local three-tier architecture. Looking forward, HAPs are expected to evolve from simple platforms into intelligent hubs, emerging as pivotal nodes for air traffic management, intelligent logistics, and emergency response. By doing so, they will accelerate the transition of the LAE toward large-scale deployment, autonomy, and sustainable growth.

Abstract: In-Motion physical coupling of multiple mobile ground robots has the potential to enable new applications like in-motion transfer that improves efficiency in handling and transferring goods, which tackles current challenges in logistics. A key challenge lies in achieving reliable autonomous in-motion physical coupling of two mobile ground robots starting at any initial position. Existing approaches neglect the modeling of the docking interface and the strategy for approaching it, resulting in uncontrolled collisions that make in-motion physical coupling either impossible or inefficient. To address this challenge, we propose a central mpc approach that explicitly models the dynamics and states of two omnidirectional wheeled robots, incorporates constraints related to their docking interface, and implements an approaching strategy for rendezvous and docking. This novel approach enables omnidirectional wheeled robots with a docking interface to physically couple in motion regardless of their initial position. In addition, it makes in-motion transfer possible, which is 19.75% more time- and 21.04% energy-efficient compared to a non-coupling approach in a logistic scenario.

Abstract: This work presents a stochastic tube-based model predictive control framework that guarantees hard input constraint satisfaction for linear systems subject to unbounded additive disturbances. The approach relies on a structured design of probabilistic reachable sets that explicitly incorporates actuator saturation into the error dynamics and bounds the resulting nonlinearity within a convex embedding. The proposed controller retains the computational efficiency and structural advantages of stochastic tube-based approaches while ensuring state chance constraint satisfaction alongside hard input limits. Recursive feasibility and mean-square stability are established for our scheme, and a numerical example illustrates its effectiveness.

Abstract: We address the edge-based synchronization problem in first-order multi-agent systems containing both cooperative and antagonistic interactions with one or multiple leader groups. The presence of multiple leaders and antagonistic interactions means that the multi-agent typically does not achieve consensus, unless specific conditions (on the number of leaders and on the signed graph) are met, in which case the agents reach a trivial form of consensus. In general, we show that the multi-agent system exhibits a more general form of synchronization, including bipartite consensus and containment. Our approach uses the signed edge-based agreement protocol for signed networks described by signed edge-Laplacian matrices. In particular, in this work, we present new spectral properties of signed edge-Laplacian matrices containing multiple zero eigenvalues and establish global exponential stability of the synchronization errors. Moreover, we compute the equilibrium to which all edge states converge. Numerical simulations validate our theoretical results.

Abstract: Solving safety-critical control problem has widely adopted the Control Barrier Function (CBF) method. However, the existence of a CBF is only a sufficient condition for system safety. The recently proposed Taylor-Lagrange Control (TLC) method addresses this limitation, but is vulnerable to the feasibility preservation problem (e.g., inter-sampling effect). In this paper, we propose a robust TLC (rTLC) method to address the feasibility preservation problem. Specifically, the rTLC method expands the safety function at an order higher than the relative degree of the function using Taylor's expansion with Lagrange remainder, which allows the control to explicitly show up at the current time instead of the future time in the TLC method. The rTLC method naturally addresses the feasibility preservation problem with only one hyper-parameter (the discretization time interval size during implementation), which is much less than its counterparts. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed rTLC method through an adaptive cruise control problem, and compare it with existing safety-critical control methods.

Abstract: In this paper, we show how informativity and identifiability for networks of dynamical systems can be investigated using Gröbner bases. We provide a sufficient condition for informativity in terms of positive definiteness of the spectrum of external signals and full generic rank of the transfer function relating the external signals to the inputs of the predictor. Moreover, we show how generic local network identifiability can be investigated by computing the dimension of the fiber associated with the closed loop transfer function from external measurable signals to the measured outputs.
