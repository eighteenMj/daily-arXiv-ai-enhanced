However, existing active reconstruction methods often rely on hand-crafted geometric heuristics, which can lead to redundant observations without substantially improving reconstruction quality. To address this limitation, we propose AREA3D, an active reconstruction agent that leverages feed-forward 3D reconstruction models and vision-language guidance. Our framework decouples view-uncertainty modeling from the underlying feed-forward reconstructor, enabling precise uncertainty estimation without expensive online optimization. In addition, an integrated vision-language model provides high-level semantic guidance, encouraging informative and diverse viewpoints beyond purely geometric cues. Extensive experiments on both scene-level and object-level benchmarks demonstrate that AREA3D achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy, particularly in the sparse-view regime.

Existing studies consider maintaining similar error across different resolutions as indicative of successful multi-resolution generalization. However, deep learning models serving as alternatives to numerical solvers should reduce error as resolution increases. The fundamental limitation is, the upper bound of physical law frequencies that low-resolution data can represent is constrained by its Nyquist frequency, making it difficult for models to process signals containing unseen frequency components during high-resolution inference. This results in errors being anchored at low resolution, incorrectly interpreted as successful generalization. We define this fundamental phenomenon as a new problem distinct from existing issues: Scale Anchoring. Therefore, we propose architecture-agnostic Frequency Representation Learning. It alleviates Scale Anchoring through resolution-aligned frequency representations and spectral consistency training: on grids with higher Nyquist frequencies, the frequency response in high-frequency bands of FRL-enhanced variants is more stable. This allows errors to decrease with resolution and significantly outperform baselines within our task and resolution range, while incurring only modest computational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa'\u5c3a\u5ea6\u951a\u5b9a'\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u73b0\u6709\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65f6\u7a7a\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\uff0c\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8bef\u5dee\u88ab\u9501\u5b9a\u5728\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u9519\u8bef\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u6cdb\u5316\u6210\u529f\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u67b6\u6784\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u9891\u7387\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u9891\u7387\u8868\u793a\u548c\u8c31\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u5dee\u80fd\u968f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8ba4\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\u5373\u6210\u529f\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u968f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u5dee\u3002\u6839\u672c\u9650\u5236\u662f\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5948\u594e\u65af\u7279\u9891\u7387\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u80fd\u8868\u793a\u7684\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u9891\u7387\u4e0a\u9650\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u672a\u89c1\u7684\u9891\u7387\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u9020\u6210\u8bef\u5dee\u9501\u5b9a\u5728\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9891\u7387\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff1a1) \u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u9891\u7387\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e0d\u540c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u9891\u7387\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fde\u7eed\u6269\u5c55\uff1b2) \u8c31\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u8c31\u5339\u914d\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4fdd\u6301\u9891\u7387\u54cd\u5e94\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5728\u9ad8\u5948\u594e\u65af\u7279\u9891\u7387\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u4e5f\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u9891\u5e26\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u67b6\u6784\u65e0\u5173\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u8f83\u5c0f\u3002", "result": "FRL\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u9ad8\u5948\u594e\u65af\u7279\u9891\u7387\u7f51\u683c\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u9ad8\u9891\u5e26\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u8bef\u5dee\u80fd\u968f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\uff0c\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u53ea\u5e26\u6765\u9002\u5ea6\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u5c3a\u5ea6\u951a\u5b9a\u65b0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9891\u7387\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65f6\u7a7a\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u771f\u6b63\u5b9e\u73b0\u968f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u800c\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4e3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

We empirically observe there exists feature invariance in deterministic sampling, and present InvarDiff, a training-free acceleration method that exploits the relative temporal invariance across timestep-scale and layer-scale. From a few deterministic runs, we compute a per-timestep, per-layer, per-module binary cache plan matrix and use a re-sampling correction to avoid drift when consecutive caches occur. Using quantile-based change metrics, this matrix specifies which module at which step is reused rather than recomputed. The same invariance criterion is applied at the step scale to enable cross-timestep caching, deciding whether an entire step can reuse cached results. During inference, InvarDiff performs step-first and layer-wise caching guided by this matrix. When applied to DiT and FLUX, our approach reduces redundant compute while preserving fidelity.

Accurate identification of the culprit vessel and assessment of stenosis severity are essential for guiding individualized therapy. Although coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is the first-line non-invasive modality for CAD diagnosis, its dependence on high-end equipment, radiation exposure, and strict patient cooperation limits large-scale use. With advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and the widespread availability of electrocardiography (ECG), AI-ECG offers a promising alternative for CAD screening. In this study, we developed an interpretable AI-ECG model to predict severe or complete stenosis of the four major coronary arteries on CCTA. On the internal validation set, the model's AUCs for the right coronary artery (RCA), left main coronary artery (LM), left anterior descending artery (LAD), and left circumflex artery (LCX) were 0.794, 0.818, 0.744, and 0.755, respectively; on the external validation set, the AUCs reached 0.749, 0.971, 0.667, and 0.727, respectively. Performance remained stable in a clinically normal-ECG subset, indicating robustness beyond overt ECG abnormalities.

Live concerts, collaborative composition, and interactive experiences are driving the Musical Metaverse (MM), but the requirements of the underlying network and service infrastructures hinder its growth. These challenges underscore the need for a novel modeling and simulation paradigm tailored to the unique characteristics of MM sessions, along with specialized service provisioning strategies capable of capturing their interactive, heterogeneous, and multicast-oriented nature. To this end, we make a first attempt to formally model and analyze the problem of service provisioning for MM sessions in 5G/6G networks. We first formalize service and network graph models for the MM, using \"live audience interaction in a virtual concert\" as a reference scenario. We then present MuMeNet, a novel discrete-event network simulator specifically tailored to the requirements and the traffic dynamics of the MM. We showcase the effectiveness of MuMeNet by running a linear programming based orchestration policy on the reference scenario and providing performance analysis under realistic MM workloads.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, it remains a challenging problem in real-world conditions, where traditional methods are not applicable due to the lack of accurate floor plans, physical access to place calibration patterns, or synchronized video streams. This paper presents a novel two-stage calibration method that overcomes these limitations. In the first stage, partial calibration of individual cameras is performed based on an operator's annotation of natural geometric primitives (parallel, perpendicular, and vertical lines, or line segments of equal length). This allows estimating key parameters (roll, pitch, focal length) and projecting the camera's Effective Field of View (EFOV) onto the horizontal plane in a base 3D coordinate system. In the second stage, precise system calibration is achieved through interactive manipulation of the projected EFOV polygons. The operator adjusts their position, scale, and rotation to align them with the floor plan or, in its absence, using virtual calibration elements projected onto all cameras in the system. This determines the remaining extrinsic parameters (camera position and yaw). Calibration requires only a static image from each camera, eliminating the need for physical access or synchronized video. The method is implemented as a practical web service. Comparative analysis and demonstration videos confirm the method's applicability, accuracy, and flexibility, enabling the deployment of precise multi-camera tracking systems in scenarios previously considered infeasible.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u591a\u76f8\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6807\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u5143\uff08\u5e73\u884c\u3001\u5782\u76f4\u7b49\u7ebf\uff09\u5bf9\u5355\u4e2a\u76f8\u673a\u8fdb\u884c\u90e8\u5206\u6807\u5b9a\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u64cd\u4f5c\u76f8\u673a\u6709\u6548\u89c6\u573a\u591a\u8fb9\u5f62\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6807\u5b9a\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9700\u6bcf\u53f0\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u9759\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7269\u7406\u8bbf\u95ee\u6216\u540c\u6b65\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u76f8\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6807\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cbe\u786e\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u653e\u7f6e\u6807\u5b9a\u56fe\u6848\u6216\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u4e0d\u540c\u6b65\u800c\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u6807\u5b9a\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1. \u5229\u7528\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u51e0\u4f55\u57fa\u5143\uff08\u5e73\u884c\u7ebf\u3001\u5782\u76f4\u7ebf\u3001\u7b49\u957f\u7ebf\u6bb5\uff09\u5bf9\u5355\u4e2a\u76f8\u673a\u8fdb\u884c\u90e8\u5206\u6807\u5b9a\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u76f8\u673a\u6709\u6548\u89c6\u573a\u5728\u6c34\u5e73\u9762\u4e0a\u7684\u6295\u5f71\n2. \u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u64cd\u4f5c\u6295\u5f71\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u8fb9\u5f62\uff08\u8c03\u6574\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\uff09\u6765\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u6216\u65e0\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u865a\u62df\u6807\u5b9a\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u5916\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u5269\u4f59\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u6574\u4e2a\u6d41\u7a0b\u4ee5\u7f51\u9875\u670d\u52a1\u5f62\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u591a\u76f8\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6807\u5b9a\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u9759\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u5373\u53ef\u5b8c\u6210\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7269\u7406\u8bbf\u95ee\u6216\u540c\u6b65\u89c6\u9891\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6f14\u793a\u89c6\u9891\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6807\u5b9a\u65b9\u6cd5\u514b\u670d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97\u5148\u524d\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u591a\u76f8\u673a\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u90e8\u7f72\u6210\u4e3a\u53ef\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cbe\u786e\u5e73\u9762\u56fe\u3001\u65e0\u6cd5\u653e\u7f6e\u6807\u5b9a\u56fe\u6848\u6216\u89c6\u9891\u6d41\u4e0d\u540c\u6b65\u7684\u590d\u6742\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002"}}

This paper presents ARCAS, a real-time augmented reality collision avoidance system that provides personalized spatial alerts to VRUs via wearable AR headsets. By fusing roadside 360-degree 3D LiDAR with SLAM-based headset tracking and an automatic 3D calibration procedure, ARCAS accurately overlays world-locked 3D bounding boxes and directional arrows onto approaching hazards in the user's passthrough view. The system also enables multi-headset coordination through shared world anchoring. Evaluated in real-world pedestrian interactions with e-scooters and vehicles (180 trials), ARCAS nearly doubled pedestrians' time-to-collision and increased counterparts' reaction margins by up to 4x compared to unaided-eye conditions.

To address this, we introduce ChromouVQA, a large-scale, multi-task benchmark based on Ishihara-style chromatic camouflaged images. We extend classic dot plates with multiple fill geometries and vary chromatic separation, density, size, occlusion, and rotation, recording full metadata for reproducibility. The benchmark covers nine vision-question-answering tasks, including recognition, counting, comparison, and spatial reasoning. Evaluations of humans and VLMs reveal large gaps, especially under subtle chromatic contrast or disruptive geometric fills. We also propose a model-agnostic contrastive recipe aligning silhouettes with their camouflaged renderings, improving recovery of global shapes.

However, existing approaches typically rely on uniform random masking, implicitly assuming all features are equally predictable. In reality, laboratory tests exhibit substantial heterogeneity in volatility: some biomarkers (e.g., sodium) remain stable, while others (e.g., lactate) fluctuate considerably and are more difficult to model. Clinically, volatile biomarkers often signal acute pathophysiology and require more sophisticated modeling to capture their complex temporal patterns. We propose a volatility-aware pretraining strategy, Coefficient of Variation Masking (CV-Masking), that adaptively adjusts masking probabilities according to the intrinsic variability of each feature. Combined with a value-only masking objective aligned with clinical workflows, CV-Masking yields systematic improvements over random and variance-based strategies. Experiments on a large panel of laboratory tests show that CV-Masking enhances reconstruction, improves downstream predictive performance, and accelerates convergence, producing more robust and clinically meaningful EHR representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCV-Masking\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5185\u5728\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u8c03\u6574\u63a9\u7801\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u968f\u673a\u63a9\u7801\u63d0\u5347EHR\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MAE\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u5747\u5300\u968f\u673a\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u6240\u6709\u7279\u5f81\u540c\u7b49\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u68c0\u6d4b\u6307\u6807\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u2014\u2014\u4e00\u4e9b\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u4e9b\u6ce2\u52a8\u5267\u70c8\u4e14\u66f4\u96be\u5efa\u6a21\u3002\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e0a\uff0c\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u5e38\u63d0\u793a\u6025\u6027\u75c5\u7406\u751f\u7406\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6ce2\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565CV-Masking\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5185\u5728\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u6574\u63a9\u7801\u6982\u7387\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7eaf\u503c\u63a9\u7801\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u53d8\u5f02\u7cfb\u6570\u8861\u91cf\u7279\u5f81\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u68c0\u6d4b\u9762\u677f\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCV-Masking\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u4e0b\u6e38\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u4e34\u5e8a\u610f\u4e49\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684EHR\u8868\u793a", "conclusion": "CV-Masking\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684EHR\u8868\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e3a\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411"}}

We propose two new unsupervised metrics for faithfulness evaluation using insights from information theory and thermodynamics. Our approach treats an LLM as a bipartite information engine where hidden layers act as a Maxwell demon controlling transformations of context $C $ into answer $A$ via prompt $Q$. We model Question-Context-Answer (QCA) triplets as probability distributions over shared topics. Topic transformations from $C$ to $Q$ and $A$ are modeled as transition matrices ${\\bf Q}$ and ${\\bf A}$ encoding the query goal and actual result, respectively. Our semantic faithfulness (SF) metric quantifies faithfulness for any given QCA triplet by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between these matrices. Both matrices are inferred simultaneously via convex optimization of this KL divergence, and the final SF metric is obtained by mapping the minimal divergence onto the unit interval [0,1], where higher scores indicate greater faithfulness. Furthermore, we propose a thermodynamics-based semantic entropy production (SEP) metric in answer generation, and show that high faithfulness generally implies low entropy production. The SF and SEP metrics can be used jointly or separately for LLM evaluation and hallucination control.

This scarcity introduces epistemic uncertainty, i.e., reducible uncertainty stemming from incomplete knowledge of the underlying data distribution, which fundamentally limits predictive performance. This review paper examines formal methodologies that address data-limited regimes through two complementary approaches: quantifying epistemic uncertainty and mitigating data scarcity via synthetic data augmentation. We begin by reviewing generalized Bayesian learning frameworks that characterize epistemic uncertainty through generalized posteriors in the model parameter space, as well as ``post-Bayes'' learning frameworks. We continue by presenting information-theoretic generalization bounds that formalize the relationship between training data quantity and predictive uncertainty, providing a theoretical justification for generalized Bayesian learning. Moving beyond methods with asymptotic statistical validity, we survey uncertainty quantification methods that provide finite-sample statistical guarantees, including conformal prediction and conformal risk control. Finally, we examine recent advances in data efficiency by combining limited labeled data with abundant model predictions or synthetic data.

However, segmentation remains challenging given the small size of many nuclei, limited intrathalamic contrast and image resolution, and inter-subject anatomical variability. In this work, we present CATNUS (Coordinate-Aware Thalamic Nuclei Segmentation), segmenting 13 thalamic nuclei (or nuclear groups) using a 3D U-Net architecture enhanced with coordinate convolution layers, which provide more precise localization of both large and small nuclei. To support broad clinical applicability, we provide pre-trained model variants that can operate on quantitative T1 maps as well as on widely used magnetization-prepared rapid gradient echo (MPRAGE) and fast gray matter acquisition T1 inversion recovery (FGATIR) sequences. We benchmarked CATNUS against established methods, including FreeSurfer, THOMAS and HIPS-THOMAS, demonstrating improved segmentation accuracy and robust test-retest reliability across multiple nuclei. Furthermore, CATNUS demonstrated strong out-of-distribution generalization on traveling-subject datasets spanning multiple scanners, field strengths, and vendors, producing reliable and anatomically coherent segmentations across diverse acquisition conditions. Overall, CATNUS provides an accurate and generalizable solution for thalamic nuclei segmentation, with strong potential to facilitate large-scale neuroimaging studies and support real-world clinical assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5750\u6807\u5377\u79ef\u6539\u8fdb3D U-Net\u5b9e\u73b013\u4e2a\u4e18\u8111\u6838\u56e2\u51c6\u786e\u5206\u5272", "motivation": "\u51c6\u786e\u5206\u5272\u4e18\u8111\u6838\u56e2\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u6838\u56e2\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5c0f\u3001\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3001\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6709\u9650\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u7b49\u6311\u6218", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCATNUS(C\u5750\u6807\u611f\u77e5\u4e18\u8111\u6838\u56e2\u5206\u5272)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u75283D U-Net\u67b6\u6784\u589e\u5f3a\u5750\u6807\u5377\u79ef\u5c42\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u529b", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4FreeSurfer\u3001THOMAS\u548cHIPS-THOMAS\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cCATNUS\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6838\u56e2\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u91cd\u6d4b\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u8de8\u5e73\u53f0\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a", "conclusion": "CATNUS\u4e3a\u4e18\u8111\u6838\u56e2\u5206\u5272\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u652f\u6301\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u795e\u7ecf\u5f71\u50cf\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528"}}

Our approach combines a lightweight U-Net transfer encoder with a diffusion-based generative model. The simpler U-Net is first pretrained on a long time series of coarse resolution data to learn spatiotemporal representations; its encoder is then frozen and transferred to a larger downscaling model as physically meaningful latent features. Our application uses NASA's MERRA-2 reanalysis as the low resolution source domain (50 km) and the GEOS-5 Nature Run (G5NR) as the high resolution target (7 km). Our study area included a large area in Asia, which was made computationally tractable by splitting into two subregions and four seasons. We conducted domain similarity analysis using Wasserstein distances confirmed minimal distributional shift between MERRA-2 and G5NR, validating the safety of parameter frozen transfer. Across seasonal regional splits, our model achieved excellent performance (R2 = 0.65 to 0.94), outperforming comparison models including deterministic U-Nets, variational autoencoders, and prior transfer learning baselines. Out of data evaluations using semivariograms, ACF/PACF, and lag-based RMSE/R2 demonstrated that the predicted downscaled images preserved physically consistent spatial variability and temporal autocorrelation, enabling stable autoregressive reconstruction beyond the G5NR record. These results show that transfer enhanced diffusion models provide a robust and physically coherent solution for downscaling a long time series of coarse resolution images with limited training periods. This advancement has significant implications for improving environmental exposure assessment and long term environmental monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5728\u4e9a\u6d32\u533a\u57df\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u7cbe\u7ec6\u73af\u5883\u76d1\u6d4b\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u7269\u7406\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7U-Net\u8fc1\u79fb\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u9996\u5148\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3U-Net\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u5176\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u51bb\u7ed3\u5e76\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002\u4f7f\u7528MERRA-2\u518d\u5206\u6790\u6570\u636e\uff0850\u516c\u91cc\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6e90\u57df\uff0cGEOS-5 Nature Run\uff087\u516c\u91cc\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u76ee\u6807\u57df\uff0c\u5c06\u7814\u7a76\u533a\u57df\u6309\u5b63\u8282\u548c\u5b50\u533a\u57df\u5206\u5272\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b63\u8282\u533a\u57df\u5212\u5206\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff08R2=0.65-0.94\uff09\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027U-Net\u3001\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u5148\u524d\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u534a\u53d8\u5f02\u51fd\u6570\u3001ACF/PACF\u548c\u6ede\u540eRMSE/R2\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728G5NR\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e4b\u5916\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fc1\u79fb\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u56fe\u50cf\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5bf9\u6539\u5584\u73af\u5883\u66b4\u9732\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u957f\u671f\u73af\u5883\u76d1\u6d4b\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

We present a systematic evaluation of tokenization approaches for clinical time series modeling using transformer-based architectures, revealing task-dependent and sometimes counterintuitive findings about temporal and value feature importance. Through controlled ablations across four clinical prediction tasks on MIMIC-IV, we demonstrate that explicit time encodings provide no consistent statistically significant benefit for the evaluated downstream tasks. Value features show task-dependent importance, affecting mortality prediction but not readmission, suggesting code sequences alone can carry sufficient predictive signal. We further show that frozen pretrained code encoders dramatically outperform their trainable counterparts while requiring dramatically fewer parameters. Larger clinical encoders provide consistent improvements across tasks, benefiting from frozen embeddings that eliminate computational overhead. Our controlled evaluation enables fairer tokenization comparisons and demonstrates that simpler, parameter-efficient approaches can, in many cases, achieve strong performance, though the optimal tokenization strategy remains task-dependent.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e0d\u540cTokenization\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5b58\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u66f4\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4e5f\u80fd\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u4ecd\u9700\u57fa\u4e8e\u5177\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u5404\u79cdTokenization\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u7f3a\u4e4f\u516c\u5e73\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4ee5\u6307\u5bfc\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728MIMIC-IV\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u56db\u4e2a\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u7167\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u3001\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u3001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5927\u5c0f\u53ca\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u6027\u7b49Tokenization\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "1.\u663e\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u672a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b2.\u503c\u7279\u5f81\u5177\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u4f46\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u518d\u5165\u9662\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b3.\u51bb\u7ed3\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u7248\u672c\u4e14\u6240\u9700\u53c2\u6570\u66f4\u5c11\uff1b4.\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e26\u6765\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u53d7\u76ca\u4e8e\u51bb\u7ed3\u5d4c\u5165\u6d88\u9664\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u6570\u4e34\u5e8a\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u80fd\u591f\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u6700\u4f18Tokenization\u7b56\u7565\u4ecd\u7136\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5177\u4f53\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u7167\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

For this nominal system, a stabilizing law is derived from an offline dataset that has been acquired from the plant during experiments, such that the system states exponentially converge to a subspace.

We introduce FlowEO, a novel framework that leverages generative models for image-space UDA in Earth observation. We leverage flow matching to learn a semantically preserving mapping that transports from the source to the target image distribution. This allows us to tackle challenging domain adaptation configurations for classification and semantic segmentation of Earth observation images. We conduct extensive experiments across four datasets covering adaptation scenarios such as SAR to optical translation and temporal and semantic shifts caused by natural disasters.

In this work we look at this question and we attempt to define the upper bounds, not just of A.I., but rather of any machine-computable process (a.k.a. an algorithm). To answer this question however, one must first precisely define A.G.I. We borrow prior work's definition of A.G.I. [1] that best describes the sentiment of the term, as used by the leading developers of A.I. That is, the ability to be creative and innovate in some field of study in a way that unlocks new and previously unknown functional capabilities in that field. Based on this definition we draw new bounds on the limits of computation. We formally prove that no algorithm can demonstrate new functional capabilities that were not already present in the initial algorithm itself. Therefore, no algorithm (and thus no A.I. model) can be truly creative in any field of study, whether that is science, engineering, art, sports, etc. In contrast, A.I. models can demonstrate existing functional capabilities, as well as combinations and permutations of existing functional capabilities. We conclude this work by discussing the implications of this proof both as it regards to the future of A.I. development, as well as to what it means for the origins of human intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our method is iterative and has three stages: (1) generate diverse multimodal instruction-response pairs at varying quality levels, (2) generate reasoning traces and judgments for each pair, removing the ones that do not match our expected quality levels, and (3) training on correct judge answers and their reasoning traces. We evaluate the resulting judge on Multimodal RewardBench and VL-RewardBench across domains: correctness, preference, reasoning, safety, and visual question-answering. Our method improves a Llama-3.2-11B multimodal judge from 0.38 to 0.51 in overall accuracy on VL-RewardBench, often outperforming much larger models including Llama-3.2-90B, GPT-4o, and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, with particularly strong gains in general, hallucination, and reasoning dimensions.

The aim of this work is to demonstrate that possibility theory is not merely an alternative, but provides a fundamental resolution to DST paradoxes.

This paper attempts to introduce a concept of a tiered embedder in fine-grained image generation, which integrates semantic information from both super and child classes, allowing the diffusion model to better incorporate semantic information and address the issue of semantic entanglement. To address the issue of insufficient detail in fine-grained images, we introduce the concept of super-resolution during the perceptual information generation stage, enhancing the detailed features of fine-grained images through enhancement and degradation models.

This paper introduces a completely innovative architecture and concept: combining the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with a specific clinical application, known as MCP-AI. This integration allows intelligent agents to reason over extended periods, collaborate securely, and adhere to authentic clinical logic, representing a significant shift away from traditional Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) and prompt-based Large Language Models (LLMs). As healthcare systems become more complex, the need for autonomous, context-aware clinical reasoning frameworks has become urgent. We present MCP-AI, a novel architecture for explainable medical decision-making built upon the Model Context Protocol (MCP) a modular, executable specification for orchestrating generative and descriptive AI agents in real-time workflows. Each MCP file captures clinical objectives, patient context, reasoning state, and task logic, forming a reusable and auditable memory object. Unlike conventional CDSS or stateless prompt-based AI systems, MCP-AI supports adaptive, longitudinal, and collaborative reasoning across care settings. MCP-AI is validated through two use cases: (1) diagnostic modeling of Fragile X Syndrome with comorbid depression, and (2) remote coordination for Type 2 Diabetes and hypertension. In either scenario, the protocol facilitates physician-in-the-loop validation, streamlines clinical processes, and guarantees secure transitions of AI responsibilities between healthcare providers. The system connects with HL7/FHIR interfaces and adheres to regulatory standards, such as HIPAA and FDA SaMD guidelines.

We introduce a multifidelity learning framework that corrects coarse quantum solutions to high-fidelity accuracy using sparse classical training data, facilitating the path toward practical quantum utility for scientific computing. The approach trains a low-fidelity surrogate on abundant quantum solver outputs, then learns correction mappings through a multifidelity neural architecture that balances linear and nonlinear transformations. Demonstrated on benchmark nonlinear PDEs including viscous Burgers equation and incompressible Navier-Stokes flows via quantum lattice Boltzmann methods, the framework successfully corrects coarse quantum predictions and achieves temporal extrapolation well beyond the classical training window. This strategy illustrates how one can reduce expensive high-fidelity simulation requirements while producing predictions that are competitive with classical accuracy.

Under such limited information, ensuring robust or classical quantitative safety over finite or infinite horizons is generally infeasible. To address this challenge, we propose a data-driven framework that provides theoretical one-step safety guarantees in the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) sense. This one-step guarantee can be applied recursively at each time step, thereby yielding step-by-step safety assurances over extended horizons. Our approach formulates barrier certificate conditions based solely on sampled data and establishes PAC safety guarantees by leveraging the VC dimension, scenario approaches, Markov's inequality, and Hoeffding's inequality. Two sampling procedures are proposed, and three methods are proposed to derive PAC safety guarantees. The properties and comparative advantages of these three methods are thoroughly discussed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed methods are demonstrated through several numerical examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Through a comparative analysis of influence functions across language and vision tasks, we identify subsets of training data with negligible impact on model outputs.

However, evaluation of rendering aesthetics, a growing domain relevant to photographic editing, content creation, and AI-generated imagery, remains underexplored due to the lack of datasets that reflect the inherently subjective nature of style preference. In this work, a novel benchmark dataset designed to model human aesthetic judgments of image rendering styles is introduced: the Dataset for Evaluating the Aesthetics of Rendering (DEAR). Built upon the MIT-Adobe FiveK dataset, DEAR incorporates pairwise human preference scores collected via large-scale crowdsourcing, with each image pair evaluated by 25 distinct human evaluators with a total of 13,648 of them participating overall. These annotations capture nuanced, context-sensitive aesthetic preferences, enabling the development and evaluation of models that go beyond traditional distortion-based IQA, focusing on a new task: Evaluation of Aesthetics of Rendering (EAR). The data collection pipeline is described, human voting patterns are analyzed, and multiple use cases are outlined, including style preference prediction, aesthetic benchmarking, and personalized aesthetic modeling. To the best of the authors' knowledge, DEAR is the first dataset to systematically address image aesthetics of rendering assessment grounded in subjective human preferences.

The benchmark enables quantitative comparison of \"self-control\" across model families, decoding strategies, and temptation types. Beyond single-model evaluation, we outline how micro-level akrasia may compound into macro-level instability in multi-agent systems that may be interpreted as \"scheming\" or deliberate misalignment.

This paper formulates the noise covariance estimation as a bilevel optimization problem that factorizes the joint likelihood of primary and supervisory measurements to reconcile information exploitation with computational tractability. The factorization converts the nested Bayesian dependency into a Markov-chain structure, allowing efficient computation. At the lower level, a Kalman filter with state augmentation performs such computation.

Event cameras offer sparse, motion-driven sensing with low power consumption, but produce asynchronous event streams rather than RGB video. We propose a hybrid capture paradigm that records sparse RGB keyframes alongside continuous event streams, then reconstructs full RGB video offline -- reducing capture power consumption while maintaining standard video output for downstream applications. We introduce the Image and Event to Video (IE2Video) task: reconstructing RGB video sequences from a single initial frame and subsequent event camera data. We investigate two architectural strategies: adapting an autoregressive model (HyperE2VID) for RGB generation, and injecting event representations into a pretrained text-to-video diffusion model (LTX) via learned encoders and low-rank adaptation. Our experiments demonstrate that the diffusion-based approach achieves 33\\% better perceptual quality than the autoregressive baseline (0.283 vs 0.422 LPIPS).

We propose RKHS--SHAP-based Advanced Actor--Critic (RSA2C), an attribution-aware, kernelized, two-timescale AC algorithm, including Actor, Value Critic, and Advantage Critic. The Actor is instantiated in a vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) with a Mahalanobis-weighted operator-valued kernel, while the Value Critic and Advantage Critic reside in scalar RKHSs. These RKHS-enhanced components use sparsified dictionaries: the Value Critic maintains its own dictionary, while the Actor and Advantage Critic share one. State attributions, computed from the Value Critic via RKHS--SHAP (kernel mean embedding for on-manifold expectations and conditional mean embedding for off-manifold expectations), are converted into Mahalanobis-gated weights that modulate Actor gradients and Advantage Critic targets. Theoretically, we derive a global, non-asymptotic convergence bound under state perturbations, showing stability through the perturbation-error term and efficiency through the convergence-error term.

However, they suffer from limited multi-rationale semantic modeling, insufficient logical robustness, and are susceptible to misleading interpretations in complex scenarios. Therefore, we propose a Multi-rationale INtegrated Discriminative (MIND) reasoning framework, which is designed to endow MLLMs with human-like cognitive abilities of \"Understand -> Rethink -> Correct\", and achieves a paradigm evolution from passive imitation-based reasoning to active discriminative reasoning. Specifically, we introduce a Rationale Augmentation and Discrimination (RAD) paradigm, which automatically and efficiently expands existing datasets by generating diverse rationales, providing a unified and extensible data foundation. Meanwhile, we design a Progressive Two-stage Correction Learning (P2CL) strategy. The first phase enhances multi-rationale positive learning, while the second phase enables active logic discrimination and correction. In addition, to mitigate representation entanglement in the multi-rationale semantic space, we propose a Multi-rationale Contrastive Alignment (MCA) optimization strategy, which achieves semantic aggregation of correct reasoning and boundary separation of incorrect reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MIND reasoning framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple public datasets covering scientific, commonsense, and mathematical scenarios. It provides a new perspective for advancing MLLMs towards higher levels of cognitive intelligence.

We introduce the Continuous Flow Operator (CFO), a framework that learns continuous-time PDE dynamics without the computational burden of standard continuous approaches, e.g., neural ODE. The key insight is repurposing flow matching to directly learn the right-hand side of PDEs without backpropagating through ODE solvers. CFO fits temporal splines to trajectory data, using finite-difference estimates of time derivatives at knots to construct probability paths whose velocities closely approximate the true PDE dynamics. A neural operator is then trained via flow matching to predict these analytic velocity fields. This approach is inherently time-resolution invariant: training accepts trajectories sampled on arbitrary, non-uniform time grids while inference queries solutions at any temporal resolution through ODE integration. Across four benchmarks (Lorenz, 1D Burgers, 2D diffusion-reaction, 2D shallow water), CFO demonstrates superior long-horizon stability and remarkable data efficiency. CFO trained on only 25% of irregularly subsampled time points outperforms autoregressive baselines trained on complete data, with relative error reductions up to 87%. Despite requiring numerical integration at inference, CFO achieves competitive efficiency, outperforming autoregressive baselines using only 50% of their function evaluations, while uniquely enabling reverse-time inference and arbitrary temporal querying.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

By orchestrating specialized TxAgents (Executors) with long-context foundation models (Analysts), we mitigate the reasoning deficits observed in monolithic models. Beyond simple modularity, we demonstrate that a Stratified Ensemble strategy significantly outperforms global pooling by preserving evidentiary diversity, effectively addressing the information bottleneck. Furthermore, our stress tests reveal critical scaling insights: (1) a \\textit{Context-Performance Paradox}, where extending reasoning contexts beyond 12k tokens introduces noise that degrades accuracy; and (2) the \\textit{Curse of Dimensionality} in action spaces, where expanding toolsets necessitates hierarchical retrieval strategies.

We introduce Correlation Aware Restoration with Diffusion (CARD), a training-free extension of DDRM that explicitly handles correlated Gaussian noise.

Then, the diffusion restoration steps are replaced with noise-whitened updates, which inherits DDRM's closed-form sampling efficiency while now being able to handle correlated noise. To emphasize the importance of addressing correlated noise, we contribute CIN-D, a novel correlated noise dataset captured across diverse illumination conditions to evaluate restoration methods on real rolling-shutter sensor noise.

Raaijmakers"], "title": "Ontology Learning with LLMs: A Benchmark Study on Axiom Identification", "comment": "Submitted to Semantic Web Journal, under review", "summary": "Ontologies are an important tool for structuring domain knowledge, but their development is a complex task that requires significant modelling and domain expertise. Ontology learning, aimed at automating this process, has seen advancements in the past decade with the improvement of Natural Language Processing techniques, and especially with the recent growth of Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper investigates the challenge of identifying axioms: fundamental ontology components that define logical relations between classes and properties. In this work, we introduce an Ontology Axiom Benchmark OntoAxiom, and systematically test LLMs on that benchmark for axiom identification, evaluating different prompting strategies, ontologies, and axiom types. The benchmark consists of nine medium-sized ontologies with together 17.118 triples, and 2.771 axioms. We focus on subclass, disjoint, subproperty, domain, and range axioms. To evaluate LLM performance, we compare twelve LLMs with three shot settings and two prompting strategies: a Direct approach where we query all axioms at once, versus an Axiom-by-Axiom (AbA) approach, where each prompt queries for one axiom only. Our findings show that the AbA prompting leads to higher F1 scores than the direct approach. However, performance varies across axioms, suggesting that certain axioms are more challenging to identify.

Capturing their 4-dimensional structures, composition and spatio-temporal configuration in-the-wild, though extremely interesting, is equally hard. Therefore, existing works often focus on one object at a time, while relying on some category-specific parametric shape model for dynamic objects. This can lead to inconsistent scene configurations, in addition to being limited to the modeled object categories. We propose COM4D (Compositional 4D), a method that consistently and jointly predicts the structure and spatio-temporal configuration of 4D/3D objects using only static multi-object or dynamic single object supervision. We achieve this by a carefully designed training of spatial and temporal attentions on 2D video input. The training is disentangled into learning from object compositions on the one hand, and single object dynamics throughout the video on the other, thus completely avoiding reliance on 4D compositional training data. At inference time, our proposed attention mixing mechanism combines these independently learned attentions, without requiring any 4D composition examples. By alternating between spatial and temporal reasoning, COM4D reconstructs complete and persistent 4D scenes with multiple interacting objects directly from monocular videos. Furthermore, COM4D provides state-of-the-art results in existing separate problems of 4D object and composed 3D reconstruction despite being purely data-driven.", "AI": {"tldr": "COM4D\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u591a\u4e2a\u7269\u4f534D\u573a\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u522b\u5b66\u4e60\u7269\u4f53\u7ec4\u5408\u548c\u5355\u4e2a\u7269\u4f53\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u65e0\u97004D\u7ec4\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u573a\u666f\u7531\u591a\u4e2a\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u7269\u4f53\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u4e00\u6b21\u53ea\u80fd\u5173\u6ce8\u4e00\u4e2a\u7269\u4f53\uff0c\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5f62\u72b6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u573a\u666f\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u7c7b\u522b", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u57282D\u89c6\u9891\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5c06\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u7269\u4f53\u7ec4\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5355\u4e2a\u7269\u4f53\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u5bf94D\u7ec4\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6df7\u5408\u673a\u5236\u7ed3\u5408\u72ec\u7acb\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b", "result": "COM4D\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u76f4\u63a5\u91cd\u5efa\u5b8c\u6574\u4e14\u6301\u4e45\u7684\u5305\u542b\u591a\u4e2a\u4ea4\u4e92\u7269\u4f53\u76844D\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u57284D\u7269\u4f53\u6062\u590d\u548c\u7ec4\u54083D\u91cd\u5efa\u7b49\u73b0\u6709\u5206\u79bb\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7ed3\u679c", "conclusion": "COM4D\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e00\u81f4\u5730\u8054\u5408\u9884\u6d4b4D/3D\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u65f6\u7a7a\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u65e0\u97004D\u7ec4\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b"}}

Recent advances in Stochastic Local Search (SLS) algorithms for solving (W)PMS have mainly focused on designing clause weighting schemes. However, existing methods often fail to adequately distinguish between PMS and WPMS, typically employing uniform update strategies for clause weights and overlooking critical structural differences between the two problem types. In this work, we present a novel clause weighting scheme that, for the first time, updates the clause weights of PMS and WPMS instances according to distinct conditions. This scheme also introduces a new initialization method, which better accommodates the unique characteristics of both instance types. Furthermore, we propose a decimation method that prioritizes satisfying unit and hard clauses, effectively complementing our proposed clause weighting scheme. Building on these methods, we develop a new SLS solver for (W)PMS named DeepDist. Experimental results on benchmarks from the anytime tracks of recent MaxSAT Evaluations show that DeepDist outperforms state-of-the-art SLS solvers. Notably, a hybrid solver combining DeepDist with TT-Open-WBO-Inc surpasses the performance of the MaxSAT Evaluation 2024 winners, SPB-MaxSAT-c-Band and SPB-MaxSAT-c-FPS, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

This paper proposes Language Action-guided Reinforcement Learning (LA-RL) with Safety Guarantees, a novel framework that integrates the semantic reasoning of large language models (LLMs) into the actor-critic architecture with an improved safety layer. Within this framework, task-specific reward shaping harmonizes the dual objectives of maximizing driving efficiency and ensuring safety, guiding decision-making based on both environmental insights and clearly defined goals. To enhance safety, LA-RL incorporates a safety-critical planner that combines model predictive control (MPC) with discrete control barrier functions (DCBFs). This layer formally constrains the LLM-informed policy to a safe action set, employs a slack mechanism that enhances solution feasibility, prevents overly conservative behavior and allows for greater policy exploration without compromising safety. Extensive experiments demonstrate that it significantly outperforms several current state-of-the-art methods, offering a more adaptive, reliable, and robust solution for autonomous highway driving. Compared to existing SOTA, it achieves approximately 20$\\%$ higher success rate than the knowledge graph (KG) based baseline and about 30$\\%$ higher than the retrieval augmented generation (RAG) based baseline. In low-density environments, LA-RL achieves a 100$\\%$ success rate. These results confirm its enhanced exploration of the state-action space and its ability to autonomously adopt more efficient, proactive strategies in complex, mixed-traffic highway environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Prior work has introduced datasets and benchmarks aimed at improving temporal reasoning, but these have emphasized other video content, including sports, cooking, and movies. No existing benchmark focuses exclusively on the unique challenges of temporal understanding in ego-centric AD footage. To fill this gap, the Temporal Understanding in Autonomous Driving (TAD) benchmark is presented, which evaluates VLMs' ability to capture the dynamic relationships between actions in AD. TAD comprises nearly 6,000 question-answer (QA) pairs, spanning 7 human-designed tasks. In addition, an evaluation is performed that consists of 9 closed- and open-source generalist models as well as SoTA AD specialist models. When applied to TAD, current SoTA models demonstrated substandard accuracies, largely due to imperfect fine-grained motion understanding. To improve motion understanding and overall accuracy on TAD, two novel training-free solutions are proposed: Scene-CoT, that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and TCogMap, which incorporates an ego-centric temporal cognitive map. The proposed approaches are integrated with existing VLMs and improve average accuracy on TAD by up to 17.72%. By introducing TAD, benchmarking multiple SoTA models, and proposing effective enhancements, this work aims to catalyze future research on temporal understanding in AD.

In this paper, we test sensitivity and robustness of an artificial intelligence (AI) weather forecasting model: NVIDIAs FourCastNetv2 (FCNv2). We conduct two experiments designed to assess model output under different levels of injected noise in the models initial condition. First, we perturb the initial condition of Hurricane Florence from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset (September 13-16, 2018) with varying amounts of Gaussian noise and examine the impact on predicted trajectories and forecasted storm intensity. Second, we start FCNv2 with fully random initial conditions and observe how the model responds to nonsensical inputs. Our results indicate that FCNv2 accurately preserves hurricane features under low to moderate noise injection. Even under high levels of noise, the model maintains the general storm trajectory and structure, although positional accuracy begins to degrade. FCNv2 consistently underestimates storm intensity and persistence across all levels of injected noise. With full random initial conditions, the model generates smooth and cohesive forecasts after a few timesteps, implying the models tendency towards stable, smoothed outputs.

Stich"], "title": "Non-Convex Federated Optimization under Cost-Aware Client Selection", "comment": null, "summary": "Different federated optimization algorithms typically employ distinct client-selection strategies: some methods communicate only with a randomly sampled subset of clients at each round, while others need to periodically communicate with all clients or use a hybrid scheme that combines both strategies. However, existing metrics for comparing optimization methods typically do not distinguish between these strategies, which often incur different communication costs in practice. To address this disparity, we introduce a simple and natural model of federated optimization that quantifies communication and local computation complexities. This new model allows for several commonly used client-selection strategies and explicitly associates each with a distinct cost. Within this setting, we propose a new algorithm that achieves the best-known communication and local complexities among existing federated optimization methods for non-convex optimization. This algorithm is based on the inexact composite gradient method with a carefully constructed gradient estimator and a special procedure for solving the auxiliary subproblem at each iteration. The gradient estimator is based on SAGA, a popular variance-reduced gradient estimator. We first derive a new variance bound for it, showing that SAGA can exploit functional similarity. We then introduce the Recursive-Gradient technique as a general way to potentially improve the error bound of a given conditionally unbiased gradient estimator, including both SAGA and SVRG. By applying this technique to SAGA, we obtain a new estimator, RG-SAGA, which has an improved error bound compared to the original one.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u672c\u5730\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8eSAGA\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86RG-SAGA\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u672c\u5730\u590d\u6742\u5ea6", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u968f\u673a\u62bd\u6837\u3001\u5168\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u3001\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6848\uff09\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u6bd4\u8f83\u6307\u6807\u672a\u533a\u5206\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u672c\u5730\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "1. \u5efa\u7acb\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5173\u8054\u4e0d\u540c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u6210\u672c\n2. \u57fa\u4e8eSAGA\u65b9\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\n3. \u63d0\u51fa\u9012\u5f52\u68af\u5ea6\uff08Recursive-Gradient\uff09\u6280\u672f\u6539\u8fdb\u6709\u6761\u4ef6\u65e0\u504f\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\n4. \u5c06\u9012\u5f52\u68af\u5ea6\u6280\u672f\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eSAGA\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u6539\u8fdb\u7684RG-SAGA\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\n5. \u57fa\u4e8eRG-SAGA\u548c\u7cbe\u5fc3\u6784\u9020\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e0d\u7cbe\u786e\u590d\u5408\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5", "result": "1. \u4e3aSAGA\u63a8\u5bfc\u65b0\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u754c\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5176\u80fd\u5229\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\n2. \u9012\u5f52\u68af\u5ea6\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u6539\u8fdbSAGA\u548cSVRG\u7b49\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\n3. \u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u8054\u90a6\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5df2\u77e5\u6700\u4f73\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u672c\u5730\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b0\u8054\u90a6\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u7edf\u4e00\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u540c\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6210\u672c\uff0cRG-SAGA\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u672c\u5730\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u8054\u90a6\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

To this end, we propose evolutionary reasoning optimization (ERO) framework which performs survival of the fittest over a population of LLMs to search for individual with strong reasoning ability. Given a reasoning task, ERO first initializes multiple LLMs as a population, after which an evolutionary strategy evolves the population to maximize quantified reasoning score of the best individual. Based on experiments on representative testsuites, we claim two surprising empirical discoveries: i) the latest LLMs such as GPT-5 still show limited system 2 reasoning ability; ii) with simple evolution-loop of ERO, a relatively weak model (Qwen-7B) could be enhanced to emerge powerful reasoning ability.

However, accurate task-specific trust evaluation of multi-hop collaborators can be extremely complex. The reason is that their trust evaluation is determined by a combination of diverse trust-related perspectives with different characteristics, including historical collaboration reliability, volatile and sensitive conditions of available resources for collaboration, as well as continuously evolving network topologies. To address this challenge, this paper presents a graph neural network (GNN)-aided distributed agentic AI (GADAI) framework, in which different aspects of devices' task-specific trustworthiness are separately evaluated and jointly integrated to facilitate multi-hop collaborator selection. GADAI first utilizes a GNN-assisted model to infer device trust from historical collaboration data. Specifically, it employs GNN to propagate and aggregate trust information among multi-hop neighbours, resulting in more accurate device reliability evaluation. Considering the dynamic and privacy-sensitive nature of device resources, a privacy-preserving resource evaluation mechanism is implemented using agentic AI. Each device hosts a large AI model-driven agent capable of autonomously determining whether its local resources meet the requirements of a given task, ensuring both task-specific and privacy-preserving trust evaluation. By combining the outcomes of these assessments, only the trusted devices can coordinate a task-oriented multi-hop cooperation path through their agents in a distributed manner. Experimental results show that our proposed GADAI outperforms the comparison algorithms in planning multi-hop paths that maximize the value of task completion.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This set forms a rank space made up of multiple individual ranks, whose expressiveness directly shapes the model's adaptability. However, quantitative analysis reveals low-rank adaptation exhibits significant redundancy in the rank space, with many ranks contributing almost no practical information. This hinders the model's ability to learn more diverse knowledge to address the various challenges in RGB-T tracking. To address this issue, we propose the Group Orthogonal Low-Rank Adaptation (GOLA) framework for RGB-T tracking, which effectively leverages the rank space through structured parameter learning. Specifically, we adopt a rank decomposition partitioning strategy utilizing singular value decomposition to quantify rank importance, freeze crucial ranks to preserve the pretrained priors, and cluster the redundant ranks into groups to prepare for subsequent orthogonal constraints. We further design an inter-group orthogonal constraint strategy. This constraint enforces orthogonality between rank groups, compelling them to learn complementary features that target diverse challenges, thereby alleviating information redundancy. Experimental results demonstrate that GOLA effectively reduces parameter redundancy and enhances feature representation capabilities, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods across four benchmark datasets and validating its effectiveness in RGB-T tracking tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We argue this conclusion misidentifies the bottleneck: it confuses the ocean with the net. Pattern repositories are the necessary System-1 substrate; the missing component is a System-2 coordination layer that selects, constrains, and binds these patterns. We formalize this layer via UCCT, a theory of semantic anchoring that models reasoning as a phase transition governed by effective support (rho_d), representational mismatch (d_r), and an adaptive anchoring budget (gamma log k).

A state-feedback controller is developed by the {nonovershooting backstepping} method to simultaneously achieve exponential output regulation and enforce safety constraints on the system output, which is the state furthest from the control input. To handle unmeasured PDE states and external disturbances, a state observer and a disturbance estimator are designed. Explicit bounds on the estimation errors are derived and used to construct a robust safe regulator that accounts for the uncertainties. The proposed control scheme guarantees that: 1) If the system output is initially within the safe region, it remains there; otherwise, it will be rescued to the safety within a prescribed time; 2) The output tracking error converges to zero exponentially; 3) The observer accurately estimates both the distributed states and external disturbances, with estimation errors converging to zero exponentially; 4) All signals in the closed-loop system remain bounded.

While Shapley value based methods provide principled feature attributions, existing formulations cannot tractably evaluate higher order interactions: the Shapley Taylor Interaction Index (STII) requires exponential scale enumeration of subsets, and current tensor based approaches such as the Marginal SHAP Tensor (MST) are restricted to first order effects. The central problem is that no existing framework simultaneously preserves the axiomatic exactness of STII and avoids the exponential computational blow up inherent to high order discrete derivatives. Here we show that high order Shapley interactions can be represented exactly as tensor network contractions, enabling polynomial time and polylog depth computation under Tensor Train (TT) structure. We introduce Interaction Tensor SHAP (IT SHAP), which reformulates STII as the contraction of a Value Tensor and a Weight Tensor, and assume a finite state TT representation of the Weight Tensor with polynomial TT ranks. Under TT structured model and distribution tensors, we show that IT SHAP reduces the exponential complex Theta(4^n) of STII to NC2 parallel time. These results demonstrate that IT SHAP provides a unified, axiomatic, and computationally tractable formulation of main effects and higher order interactions in high dimensional models.

We argue that while attention-based pruning inherently holds the potential to identify the most relevant visual tokens, its effectiveness in shallow decoder layers is limited by factors such as positional encoding bias and insufficient information interaction. In this paper, we propose an improved attention-based pruning framework, termed ShaRP, that integrates segment-aware causal masking, positional debiasing, and token deduplication for enhanced token selection. It enables effective pruning at shallow layers while maintaining stable performance under high compression rates without retraining.

To organize the processes into networks, we introduced a two-step method that grouped them into clinically meaningful clusters. We then generated explanation-augmented relationships between clusters. Experts found that networks produced by our multi-step approach outperformed those built with direct prompting for clinical utility and interpretability, with up to 90% preferring our approach. In addition, the networks were rated favorably by experts, with scores for clinical relevance, novelty, and usefulness ranging from 72-75%. Our findings provide a proof of concept for using LLMs to create clinically relevant networks from therapy transcripts. Advantages of our approach include bottom-up case conceptualization from client utterances in therapy sessions and identification of latent themes. Networks generated from our pipeline may be used in clinical settings and supervision and training. Future research should examine whether these networks improve treatment outcomes relative to other methods of treatment personalization, including statistically estimated networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Current systems rely on linear or linearized models of glucose homeostasis, which may compromise prediction accuracy and, in turn, timely decision-making by the controller. Physiological variability further complicates insulin requirements, underscoring the need for controllers that adapt dynamically and reduce user burden. Methods: We introduce the University of Bern (UniBE) hAID system, a framework based on successive linearization model predictive control (MPC). The controller integrates basal insulin infusion with the insulin bolus delivery module for meal-related and corrective bolus dosing, adapting bounds in real time to glucose dynamics while accounting for both automated and user-initiated inputs. In-silico evaluation was conducted using the commercial version of the FDA-accepted UVa/Padova metabolic simulator across nine scenarios involving persistent and time-varying errors in meal timing, carbohydrate estimation, and basal insulin profiles. Results: In the baseline scenario, UniBE achieved a mean time in range of 92.0+-13.2%, with time below range at 0.1+-0.2% and time above range at 7.9+-13.2%. Across perturbation scenarios, time in range remained between 75.1 and 92.8%, with low hypoglycemia incidence, demonstrating resilience to clinically relevant disturbances.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u7684UniBE hAID\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u4e34\u5e8a\u6270\u52a8\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u5728\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u767e\u5206\u6bd4(TIR)\u548c\u4f4e\u4f4e\u8840\u7cd6\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6df7\u5408\u81ea\u52a8\u80f0\u5c9b\u7d20\u8f93\u9001(hAID)\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u7528\u7ebf\u6027/\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u52a0\u4e0a\u751f\u7406\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u4f7f\u80f0\u5c9b\u7d20\u9700\u6c42\u590d\u6742\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u5e76\u51cf\u8f7b\u7528\u6237\u8d1f\u62c5\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236(MPC)\u7684UniBE hAID\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u57fa\u7840\u80f0\u5c9b\u7d20\u8f93\u6ce8\u548c\u9910\u65f6/\u7ea0\u6b63\u5927\u5242\u91cf\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u8c03\u6574\u8fb9\u754c\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u8840\u7cd6\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u81ea\u52a8\u548c\u7528\u6237\u8f93\u5165\u3002\u4f7f\u7528FDA\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684UVa/Padova\u4ee3\u8c22\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u57289\u79cd\u6d89\u53ca\u9910\u65f6\u3001\u78b3\u6c34\u5316\u5408\u7269\u4f30\u7b97\u548c\u57fa\u7840\u80f0\u5c9b\u7d20\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u62df\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u51c6\u573a\u666f\u4e2dUniBE\u8fbe\u523092.0\u00b113.2%\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5728\u8303\u56f4\u5185(TIR)\uff0c\u4f4e\u8840\u7cd6\u65f6\u95f40.1\u00b10.2%\uff0c\u9ad8\u8840\u7cd6\u65f6\u95f47.9\u00b113.2%\u3002\u6270\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u4e0bTIR\u4fdd\u6301\u572875.1-92.8%\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c\u4f4e\u8840\u7cd6\u53d1\u751f\u7387\u4f4e\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "UniBE hAID\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c55\u793a\u51fa\u5bf9\u5e38\u89c1\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u7ef4\u6301\u8840\u7cd6\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u4f4e\u8840\u7cd6\u98ce\u9669\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u53471\u578b\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u7ba1\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Unlike human experts who primarily rely on key areas to arrive at a diagnosis, existing slide-level multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for pathology rely on heavy slide-level encoders that process thousands of patch features in a brute-force manner, resulting in excessive computational cost. In this work, we revisit the WSI-language modeling paradigm and show that tile-level features exhibit strong global and local redundancy, whereas only a small subset of tiles are truly task-relevant. Motivated by this observation, we introduce an efficient MLLM framework, called LoC-Path, that replaces the expensive slide-level encoder with redundancy-reducing modules. We first design a Sparse Token Merger (STM) and an MAE-pretrained resampler to remove local redundancy and compress globally redundant tile tokens into a compact slide-level representation set. We then propose a Cross-Attention Routing Adapter (CARA) and a Token Importance Scorer (TIS) to integrate the compressed visual representation with the language model in a computation-efficient manner.

Peer-reviewed publications form the foundation upon which new research and knowledge are built. Errors that persist in the literature can propagate unnoticed, creating confusion in follow-up studies and complicating reproducibility. The accelerating pace of research and the increasing demands on the peer-review system make such mistakes harder to detect and avoid. To address this, we developed a Paper Correctness Checker based on GPT-5 to systematically identify mistakes in papers previously published at top AI conferences and journals. Our analysis focuses on objective mistakes-e.g., errors in formulas, derivations, calculations, figures, and tables-that have a clearly verifiable ground truth. We intentionally exclude subjective considerations such as novelty, importance, or writing quality. We find that published papers contain a non-negligible number of objective mistakes and that the average number of mistakes per paper has increased over time-from 3.8 in NeurIPS 2021 to 5.9 in NeurIPS 2025 (55.3% increase); from 4.1 in ICLR 2018 to 5.2 in ICLR 2025; and from 5.0 in TMLR 2022/23 to 5.5 in TMLR 2025. Human experts reviewed 316 potential mistakes identified by the AI Checker and confirmed that 263 were actual mistakes, corresponding to a precision of 83.2%. While most identified issues are relatively minor, correcting them would reduce confusion in the literature and strengthen reproducibility. The AI Checker also surfaced potentially more substantive mistakes that could affect the interpretation of results. Moreover, we show that the AI Checker can propose correct fixes for 75.8% of the identified mistakes.

The discrete-time dynamic evolution of each cognitive state is modeled using a first-order affine difference equation. Reliance is defined as a single discrete-valued state, whose evolution at each time step depends on the cognitive states satisfying certain threshold conditions. Using data collected from 16 participants, we estimate participant-specific model parameters based on their reliance on the automation and intermittently self-reported cognitive states during a continuous drive in a vehicle simulator. The model can be estimated using a single user's trajectory data (e.g. 8 minutes of driving), making it suitable for online parameter adaptation methods.

Traditional operational paradigms, which rely on static optimization of history-based load forecasting, often fail to capture the complex nature of real-time operational conditions, such as operator-issued maintenance mandates, emergency topology changes, or event-driven load surges. To address this challenge, we introduce InstructMPC, a closed-loop framework that integrates Large Language Models~(LLMs) to generate context-aware predictions, enabling the controller to optimize power system operation. Our method employs a Contextual Disturbances Predictor~(CDP) module to translate contextual information into predictive disturbance trajectories, which are then incorporated into the Model Predictive Control~(MPC) optimization. Unlike conventional open-loop forecasting frameworks, InstructMPC features an online tuning mechanism where the predictor's parameters are continuously updated based on the realized control cost with a theoretical guarantee, achieving a regret bound of $O(\\sqrt{T \\log T})$ for linear dynamics when optimized via a tailored loss function, ensuring task-aware learning and adaption to non-stationary grid conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recent learning-based methods attempt to overcome this challenge by training motion estimators to filter dynamic objects and focus on the static background. However, their performance is largely limited by the availability of large-scale motion segmentation datasets, resulting in inaccurate segmentation and, therefore, inferior structural 3D understanding. In this work, we introduce the Dynamic Prior (\\ourmodel) to robustly identify dynamic objects without task-specific training, leveraging the powerful reasoning capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and the fine-grained spatial segmentation capacity of SAM2. \\ourmodel can be seamlessly integrated into state-of-the-art pipelines for camera pose optimization, depth reconstruction, and 4D trajectory estimation.

Although high-dimensional text can encode rich contextual information, it also poses unique challenges for causal identification and estimation. In particular, the positivity assumption, which requires sufficient treatment overlap across confounder values, is often violated at the observational level, when massive text is represented in feature spaces. Redundant or spurious textual features inflate dimensionality, producing extreme propensity scores, unstable weights, and inflated variance in effect estimates. We address these challenges with Confounding-Aware Token Rationalization (CATR), a framework that selects a sparse necessary subset of tokens using a residual-independence diagnostic designed to preserve confounding information sufficient for unconfoundedness. By discarding irrelevant texts while retaining key signals, CATR mitigates observational-level positivity violations and stabilizes downstream causal effect estimators. Experiments on synthetic data and a real-world study using the MIMIC-III database demonstrate that CATR yields more accurate, stable, and interpretable causal effect estimates than existing baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A common solution is applying downscaling methods, which include dynamical downscaling and statistical downscaling, to the outputs of global models. This work focuses on statistical downscaling, which establishes statistical relationships between low-resolution and high-resolution historical data using statistical models. Deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for this task, giving rise to various high-performance super-resolution models, which can be directly applied for downscaling, such as diffusion models and Generative Adversarial Networks. This work relies on a diffusion-based downscaling framework named CorrDiff. In contrast to the original work of CorrDiff, the region considered in this work is nearly 20 times larger, and we not only consider surface variables as in the original work, but also encounter high-level variables (six pressure levels) as target downscaling variables. In addition, a global residual connection is added to improve accuracy. In order to generate the 3km forecasts for the China region, we apply our trained models to the 25km global grid forecasts of CMA-GFS, an operational global model of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), and SFF, a data-driven deep learning-based weather model developed from Spherical Fourier Neural Operators (SFNO). CMA-MESO, a high-resolution regional model, is chosen as the baseline model. The experimental results demonstrate that the forecasts downscaled by our method generally outperform the direct forecasts of CMA-MESO in terms of MAE for the target variables. Our forecasts of radar composite reflectivity show that CorrDiff, as a generative model, can generate fine-scale details that lead to more realistic predictions compared to the corresponding deterministic regression models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u57fa\u4e8eCorrDiff\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u7edf\u8ba1\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e2d\u56fd\u533a\u57df\u7684\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece25km\u5168\u7403\u7f51\u683c\u52303km\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9884\u62a5\u7684\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u9996\u6b21\u5904\u7406\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u53d8\u91cf\uff08\u5730\u8868+6\u4e2a\u6c14\u538b\u5c42\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u6570\u503c\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u9884\u62a5\u662f\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u52a8\u529b\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff1b\u7edf\u8ba1\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5c24\u5176\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5efa\u7acb\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0e\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5386\u53f2\u6570\u636e\u95f4\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eCorrDiff\uff08\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u6539\u8fdb\uff1a\u533a\u57df\u6269\u5927\u8fd120\u500d\uff0c\u65b0\u589e\u9ad8\u7a7a\u53d8\u91cf\uff086\u4e2a\u6c14\u538b\u5c42\uff09\uff0c\u6dfb\u52a0\u5168\u5c40\u6b8b\u5dee\u8fde\u63a5\u63d0\u5347\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u5e94\u7528\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e3aCMA-GFS\uff0825km\u5168\u7403\u7f51\u683c\uff09\u548cSFF\uff08SFNO\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5929\u6c14\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u56fd\u533a\u57df3km\u9884\u62a5\u3002", "result": "\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u540e\u7684\u9884\u62a5\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u53d8\u91cf\u7684MAE\u4e0a\u666e\u904d\u4f18\u4e8eCMA-MESO\u533a\u57df\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u62a5\u3002\u96f7\u8fbe\u7ec4\u5408\u53cd\u5c04\u7387\u9884\u62a5\u663e\u793a\uff0cCorrDiff\u4f5c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u62a5\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5929\u6c14\u964d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u62a5\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Our analysis reveals that the commonly used benchmarks do not reflect the true challenge of generalizing to novel targets. We also investigate whether large-scale self-supervised pretraining can bridge this generalization gap and we provide preliminary evidence of its potential. Furthermore, we probe the efficacy of simple methods that leverage limited test-target data to improve scoring function performance. Our findings underscore the need for more rigorous evaluation protocols and offer practical guidance for designing scoring functions with predictive power extending to novel protein targets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u86cb\u767d\u8d28-\u914d\u4f53\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u65b0\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u9776\u70b9\u4e0a\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5e38\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u771f\u5b9e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6709\u9650\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u5229\u7528\u65b9\u6cd5", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28-\u914d\u4f53\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u65b0\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u9776\u70b9\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u80fd\u5426\u8d85\u8d8a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6cdb\u5316\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "1) \u5728\u6a21\u62df\u5177\u6709\u6709\u9650\u5df2\u77e5\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u9776\u70b9\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5212\u5206\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff1b2) \u8c03\u67e5\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5f25\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\uff1b3) \u6d4b\u8bd5\u5229\u7528\u6709\u9650\u6d4b\u8bd5\u9776\u70b9\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u5347\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "1) \u5e38\u7528\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u672a\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u5411\u65b0\u9776\u70b9\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6311\u6218\uff1b2) \u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f25\u5408\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u521d\u6b65\u8bc1\u636e\uff1b3) \u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u6709\u9650\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u6539\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u65b0\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u9776\u70b9\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Despite mining's evolution into a capital-intensive industry, there is little guidance on when to purchase new Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) hardware, and no prior computational frameworks address this decision problem. We address this gap by formulating hardware acquisition as a time series classification task, predicting whether purchasing ASIC machines yields profitable (Return on Investment (ROI) >= 1), marginal (0 < ROI < 1), or unprofitable (ROI <= 0) returns within one year. We propose MineROI-Net, an open source Transformer-based architecture designed to capture multi-scale temporal patterns in mining profitability. Evaluated on data from 20 ASIC miners released between 2015 and 2024 across diverse market regimes, MineROI-Net outperforms LSTM-based and TSLANet baselines, achieving 83.7% accuracy and 83.1% macro F1-score. The model demonstrates strong economic relevance, achieving 93.6% precision in detecting unprofitable periods and 98.5% precision for profitable ones, while avoiding misclassification of profitable scenarios as unprofitable and vice versa.

These methods, in turn, commonly suffer from mode collapse into redundant structures or drift toward infeasible designs when constructive reasoning is not well grounded. We introduce RevoNAD, a reflective evolutionary orchestrator that effectively bridges LLM-based reasoning with feedback-aligned architectural search. First, RevoNAD presents a Multi-round Multi-expert Consensus to transfer isolated design rules into meaningful architectural clues. Then, Adaptive Reflective Exploration adjusts the degree of exploration leveraging reward variance; it explores when feedback is uncertain and refines when stability is reached. Finally, Pareto-guided Evolutionary Selection effectively promotes architectures that jointly optimize accuracy, efficiency, latency, confidence, and structural diversity. Across CIFAR10, CIFAR100, ImageNet16-120, COCO-5K, and Cityscape, RevoNAD achieves state-of-the-art performance.

However, existing methods struggle to fully balance sufficient interaction and flexible implementation due to vast representation difference. Considering abundant and hierarchical information in VLM's layers from low-level details to high-level semantics, we propose \\textbf{ParaUni}. It extracts features from variants VLM's layers in a \\textbf{Para}llel way for comprehensive information interaction and retains a flexible separation architecture to enhance generation in \\textbf{Uni}fied multimodal model. Concretely, visual features from all VLM's layers are fed in parallel into a Layer Integration Module (LIM), which efficiently integrates fine-grained details and semantic abstractions and provides the fused representation as a condition to the diffusion model. To further enhance performance, we reveal that these hierarchical layers respond unequally to different rewards in Reinforcement Learning (RL).

However, designing more compact and efficient deformation schemes together with rate-distortion-optimized compression strategies for dynamic 3DGS representations remains an underexplored area. Prior methods either rely on space-time 4DGS with overspecified, short-lived Gaussian primitives or on canonical 3DGS with deformation that lacks explicit temporal control. To address this, we present TED-4DGS, a temporally activated and embedding-based deformation scheme for rate-distortion-optimized 4DGS compression that unifies the strengths of both families. TED-4DGS is built on a sparse anchor-based 3DGS representation. Each canonical anchor is assigned learnable temporal-activation parameters to specify its appearance and disappearance transitions over time, while a lightweight per-anchor temporal embedding queries a shared deformation bank to produce anchor-specific deformation. For rate-distortion compression, we incorporate an implicit neural representation (INR)-based hyperprior to model anchor attribute distributions, along with a channel-wise autoregressive model to capture intra-anchor correlations. With these novel elements, our scheme achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance on several real-world datasets.

In response, this study highlights the advantages of non-ideal negative samples and proposes the IdealTSF framework, which integrates both ideal positive and negative samples for time series forecasting. IdealTSF consists of three progressive steps: pretraining, training, and optimization. It first pretrains the model by extracting knowledge from negative sample data, then transforms the sequence data into ideal positive samples during training. Additionally, a negative optimization mechanism with adversarial disturbances is applied. Extensive experiments demonstrate that negative sample data unlocks significant potential within the basic attention architecture for time series forecasting.

To bridge this gap, we introduce Affective Image Stylization (AIS), a task that applies artistic styles to evoke specific emotions while preserving content. We present EmoStyle, a framework designed to address key challenges in AIS, including the lack of training data and the emotion-style mapping. First, we construct EmoStyleSet, a content-emotion-stylized image triplet dataset derived from ArtEmis to support AIS. We then propose an Emotion-Content Reasoner that adaptively integrates emotional cues with content to learn coherent style queries. Given the discrete nature of artistic styles, we further develop a Style Quantizer that converts continuous style features into emotion-related codebook entries. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations, including user studies, demonstrate that EmoStyle enhances emotional expressiveness while maintaining content consistency. Moreover, the learned emotion-aware style dictionary is adaptable to other generative tasks, highlighting its potential for broader applications. Our work establishes a foundation for emotion-driven image stylization, expanding the creative potential of AI-generated art.", "AI": {"tldr": "EmoStyle\u6846\u67b6\u9996\u6b21\u63d0\u51fa\u60c5\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u5185\u5bb9-\u60c5\u611f-\u98ce\u683c\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u4e09\u5143\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u60c5\u611f\u5185\u5bb9\u63a8\u7406\u5668\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u91cf\u5316\u5668\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u60c5\u611f\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u827a\u672f\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u63d0\u5347AI\u751f\u6210\u827a\u672f\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u6ce8\u91cd\u89c6\u89c9\u5916\u89c2\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u827a\u672f\u98ce\u683c\u6240\u627f\u8f7d\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5f25\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u60c5\u611f\u56fe\u50cf\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u5e94\u7528\u827a\u672f\u98ce\u683c\u6765\u5524\u8d77\u7279\u5b9a\u60c5\u611f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u57fa\u4e8eArtEmis\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u96c6EmoStyleSet\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u60c5\u611f\u5185\u5bb9\u63a8\u7406\u5668\u6765\u6574\u5408\u60c5\u611f\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u67e5\u8be2\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9\u827a\u672f\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u98ce\u683c\u91cf\u5316\u5668\u5c06\u8fde\u7eed\u98ce\u683c\u7279\u5f81\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u60c5\u611f\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7801\u672c\u6761\u76ee\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\uff09\u8bc1\u660e\uff0cEmoStyle\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5185\u5bb9\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u60c5\u611f\u611f\u77e5\u98ce\u683c\u8bcd\u5178\u53ef\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u60c5\u611f\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86AI\u751f\u6210\u827a\u672f\u7684\u521b\u4f5c\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u60c5\u611f-\u98ce\u683c\u6620\u5c04\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

This study examines how ensembles balance accuracy and overfitting across four tabular classification tasks: Breast Cancer, Heart Disease, Pima Diabetes, and Credit Card Fraud. Using repeated stratified cross validation with statistical significance testing, we compare linear models, a single decision tree, and nine ensemble methods. The results show that ensembles can reach high accuracy without large gaps by reducing variance through averaging or controlled boosting. On nearly linear and clean data, linear models already generalize well and ensembles offer little additional benefit. On datasets with meaningful nonlinear structure, tree based ensembles increase test accuracy by 5 to 7 points while keeping gaps below 3 percent. On noisy or highly imbalanced datasets, ensembles remain competitive but require regularization to avoid fitting noise or majority class patterns. We also compute simple dataset complexity indicators, such as linearity score, Fisher ratio, and noise estimate, which explain when ensembles are likely to control variance effectively.

However, existing methods often struggle to generalize across different k-space undersampling patterns, requiring the training of a separate model for each specific pattern, which limits their practical applicability. To address this challenge, we propose UniFS, a Unified Frequency-Spatial Fusion model designed to handle multiple k-space undersampling patterns for MCMR tasks without any need for retraining. UniFS integrates three key modules: a Cross-Modal Frequency Fusion module, an Adaptive Mask-Based Prompt Learning module, and a Dual-Branch Complementary Refinement module. These modules work together to extract domain-invariant features from diverse k-space undersampling patterns while dynamically adapt to their own variations. Another limitation of existing MCMR methods is their tendency to focus solely on spatial information while neglect frequency characteristics, or extract only shallow frequency features, thus failing to fully leverage complementary cross-modal frequency information. To relieve this issue, UniFS introduces an adaptive prompt-guided frequency fusion module for k-space learning, significantly enhancing the model's generalization performance. We evaluate our model on the BraTS and HCP datasets with various k-space undersampling patterns and acceleration factors, including previously unseen patterns, to comprehensively assess UniFS's generalizability. Experimental results across multiple scenarios demonstrate that UniFS achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Code: https://github.com/mm1129/concept_based_rare_detector_2025", "summary": "Rare-object detection remains a challenging task in autonomous driving systems, particularly when relying solely on point cloud data. Although Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong capabilities in image understanding, their potential to enhance 3D object detection through intelligent data mining has not been fully explored. This paper proposes a novel cross-modal framework that leverages 2D VLMs to identify and mine rare objects from driving scenes, thereby improving 3D object detection performance. Our approach synthesizes complementary techniques such as object detection, semantic feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and multi-faceted outlier detection into a cohesive, explainable pipeline that systematically identifies rare but critical objects in driving scenes. By combining Isolation Forest and t-SNE-based outlier detection methods with concept-based filtering, the framework effectively identifies semantically meaningful rare objects. A key strength of this approach lies in its ability to extract and annotate targeted rare object concepts such as construction vehicles, motorcycles, and barriers.

In this case, most existing video underwater enhancement methods are performed by directly applying the single-image enhancement model frame by frame, but a natural issue is lacking temporal consistency. To relieve the problem, we rethink the temporal manifold inherent in natural videos and observe a temporal consistency prior in dynamic scenes from the local temporal frequency perspective. Building upon the specific prior and no paired-data condition, we propose an implicit representation manner for enhanced video signals, which is conducted in the wavelet-based temporal consistency field, WaterWave. Specifically, under the constraints of the prior, we progressively filter and attenuate the inconsistent components while preserving motion details and scenes, achieving a natural-flowing video. Furthermore, to represent temporal frequency bands more accurately, an underwater flow correction module is designed to rectify estimated flows considering the transmission in underwater scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WaterWave significantly enhances the quality of videos generated using single-image underwater enhancements.

In this paper, we introduce Credal and Interval Deep Evidential Classifications (CDEC and IDEC, respectively) as novel approaches to address UQ in classification tasks. CDEC and IDEC leverage a credal set (closed and convex set of probabilities) and an interval of evidential predictive distributions, respectively, allowing us to avoid overfitting to the training data and to systematically assess both epistemic (reducible) and aleatoric (irreducible) uncertainties. When those surpass acceptable thresholds, CDEC and IDEC have the capability to abstain from classification and flag an excess of epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty, as relevant. Conversely, within acceptable uncertainty bounds, CDEC and IDEC provide a collection of labels with robust probabilistic guarantees. CDEC and IDEC are trained using standard backpropagation and a loss function that draws from the theory of evidence. They overcome the shortcomings of previous efforts, and extend the current evidential deep learning literature. Through extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, together with their natural OoD shifts (F-MNIST/K-MNIST, SVHN/Intel, TinyImageNet), we show that CDEC and IDEC achieve competitive predictive accuracy, state-of-the-art OoD detection under epistemic and total uncertainty, and tight, well-calibrated prediction regions that expand reliably under distribution shift.

These methods have demonstrated remarkable empirical success but have limited theoretical understanding. Existing theoretical work is limited to sparse autoencoders with tied-weight constraints, leaving the broader family of SDL methods without formal grounding.

However, effective MSA is challenged by alignment and fusion issues. Alignment requires synchronizing both temporal and semantic information across modalities, while fusion involves integrating these aligned features into a unified representation. Existing methods often address alignment or fusion in isolation, leading to limitations in performance and efficiency. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel framework called Dual-stream Alignment with Hierarchical Bottleneck Fusion (DashFusion). Firstly, dual-stream alignment module synchronizes multimodal features through temporal and semantic alignment. Temporal alignment employs cross-modal attention to establish frame-level correspondences among multimodal sequences. Semantic alignment ensures consistency across the feature space through contrastive learning. Secondly, supervised contrastive learning leverages label information to refine the modality features. Finally, hierarchical bottleneck fusion progressively integrates multimodal information through compressed bottleneck tokens, which achieves a balance between performance and computational efficiency. We evaluate DashFusion on three datasets: CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS. Experimental results demonstrate that DashFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our alignment and fusion techniques.

Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME) is a widely used technique that explains the prediction of any classifier by learning an interpretable model locally around the predicted instance. However, it assumes that the local decision boundary is linear and fails to capture the non-linear relationships, leading to incorrect explanations. In this paper, we propose a novel method that can generate high-fidelity explanations. Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) is used to model non-linear local boundaries that effectively captures the underlying behavior of the reference model, thereby enhancing the local fidelity of the explanation. Additionally, we utilize the N-ball sampling technique, which samples directly from the desired distribution instead of reweighting samples as done in LIME, further improving the faithfulness score. We evaluate our method on three UCI datasets across different classifiers and varying kernel widths. Experimental results show that our method yields more faithful explanations compared to baselines, achieving an average reduction of 37% in root mean square error, significantly improving local fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A dead leaves model is a generative model comprised of distributions for object position, shape, color and texture. An image is generated from a dead leaves model by sampling objects (\"leaves\") from these distributions until a stopping criterion is reached, usually when the image is fully covered or until a given number of leaves was sampled. Here, we describe a theoretical approach, based on previous work, to derive a Bayesian ideal observer for the partition of a given set of pixels based on independent dead leaves model distributions. Extending previous work, we provide step-by-step explanations for the computation of the posterior probability as well as describe factors that determine the feasibility of practically applying this computation.

Although PPO-Clip mitigates this issue through importance clipping, it still overlooks the global distributional shift of actions. To address these challenges, we propose using the entropy ratio between the current and previous policies as a new global metric that effectively quantifies the relative change in policy exploration throughout updates. Building on this metric, we introduce an \\textbf{Entropy Ratio Clipping} (ERC) mechanism that imposes bidirectional constraints on the entropy ratio. This stabilizes policy updates at the global distribution level and compensates for the inability of PPO-clip to regulate probability shifts of un-sampled actions.

However, efforts to validate and replicate their successes have reported mixed results. To better understand the effectiveness of these optimizers at scale, in this work we investigate how to scale preconditioned optimizers via hyperparameter transfer, building on prior works such as $\u03bc$P. We study how the optimal learning rate and weight decay should scale with model width and depth for a wide range of optimizers, including Shampoo, SOAP, and Muon, accounting for the impact of commonly used techniques such as blocking and grafting. We find that scaling the learning rate according to $\u03bc$P improves transfer, but can still suffer from significant finite-width deviations that cause drifting optimal learning rates, which we show can be mitigated by blocking and explicit spectral normalization. For compute-optimal scaling, we find scaling independent weight decay as $1/\\mathrm{width}$ is nearly optimal across optimizers. Applying these scaling rules, we show Muon and Shampoo consistently achieve $1.4\\times$ and $1.3\\times$ speedup over AdamW for training Llama-architecture language models of sizes ranging from $190$M to $1.4$B, whereas the speedup vanishes rapidly with scale under incorrect scaling.

To address these challenges, we propose ProPhy, a Progressive Physical Alignment Framework that enables explicit physics-aware conditioning and anisotropic generation.

Medical image registration methods rely on local intensity-based similarity measures, which fail to capture global semantic structure and often yield mismatches in low-contrast or anatomically variable regions. Recent advances in diffusion models suggest that their intermediate representations encode rich geometric and semantic information. We present MedDIFT, a training-free 3D correspondence framework that leverages multi-scale features from a pretrained latent medical diffusion model as voxel descriptors. MedDIFT fuses diffusion activations into rich voxel-wise descriptors and matches them via cosine similarity, with an optional local-search prior. On a publicly available lung CT dataset, MedDIFT achieves correspondence accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art learning-based UniGradICON model and surpasses conventional B-spline-based registration, without requiring any task-specific model training.

Given a task manifold (input space), a modular decomposition, and access to module-level representations, we estimate empirical jets, which are local linear response maps that describe how each module reacts to small structured perturbations of the input. We propose an empirical notion of \\emph{mirage} regimes, where multiple distinct modular decompositions induce indistinguishable jets and thus remain observationally equivalent, and contrast this with an \\emph{identifiable} regime, where the observed jets single out a decomposition up to natural symmetries. In the setting of two-module linear regression pipelines we prove a jet-identifiability theorem. Under mild rank assumptions and access to module-level jets, the internal factorisation is uniquely determined, whereas risk-only evaluation admits a large family of mirage decompositions that implement the same input-to-output map. We then present an algorithm (MoJet) for empirical jet estimation and mirage diagnostics, and illustrate the framework using linear and deep regression as well as pipeline classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To simplify the cloth dynamics, existing methods mostly rely on linear blend skinning to obtain low-frequency posed garment shape and only regress high-frequency wrinkles. However, due to the lack of explicit skinning supervision, such skinning-based approach often produces misaligned shapes when posing the garment, consequently corrupts the high-frequency signals and fails to recover high-fidelity wrinkles. To tackle this issue, we propose a skinning-free approach by independently estimating posed (i) vertex position for low-frequency posed garment shape, and (ii) vertex normal for high-frequency local wrinkle details. In this way, each frequency modality can be effectively decoupled and directly supervised by the geometry of the deformed garment. To further improve the visual quality of animation, we propose to encode both vertex attributes as rendered texture images, so that 3D garment deformation can be equivalently achieved via 2D image transfer. This enables us to leverage powerful pretrained image models to recover fine-grained visual details in wrinkles, while maintaining superior scalability for garments of diverse topologies without relying on manual UV partition. Finally, we propose a multimodal fusion to incorporate constraints from both frequency modalities and robustly recover deformed 3D garments from transferred images. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves animation quality on various garment types and recovers finer wrinkles than state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u76843D\u670d\u88c5\u53d8\u5f62\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u72ec\u7acb\u4f30\u8ba1\u9876\u70b9\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u6cd5\u7ebf\uff0c\u5c06\u4f4e\u9891\u5f62\u72b6\u4e0e\u9ad8\u9891\u8936\u76b1\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u4f20\u8f93\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u6062\u590d\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ebf\u6027\u6df7\u5408\u8499\u76ae\u83b7\u53d6\u4f4e\u9891\u59ff\u6001\u670d\u88c5\u5f62\u72b6\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u663e\u5f0f\u8499\u76ae\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u5728\u59ff\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u7ecf\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u5f62\u72b6\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7834\u574f\u9ad8\u9891\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e76\u65e0\u6cd5\u6062\u590d\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u8936\u76b1\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u514d\u8499\u76ae\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u72ec\u7acb\u4f30\u8ba1\u9876\u70b9\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff08\u4f4e\u9891\u5f62\u72b6\uff09\u548c\u9876\u70b9\u6cd5\u7ebf\uff08\u9ad8\u9891\u8936\u76b1\u7ec6\u8282\uff09\n2. \u5c06\u9876\u70b9\u5c5e\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u7eb9\u7406\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b02D\u56fe\u50cf\u4f20\u8f93\u76843D\u670d\u88c5\u53d8\u5f62\n3. \u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u6062\u590d\u8936\u76b1\u7ec6\u8282\n4. \u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u6574\u5408\u4e24\u79cd\u9891\u7387\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u7ea6\u675f", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u670d\u88c5\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u52a8\u753b\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u8936\u76b1\u7ec6\u8282\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709skin-based\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5f62\u72b6\u9519\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u89e3\u8026\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u4f20\u8f93\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u7ec6\u8282\u4e30\u5bcc\u76843D\u670d\u88c5\u53d8\u5f62\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

While data filtering has emerged as a pretraining-time mitigation, it faces significant challenges: labeling whether data is harmful is expensive at scale, and given improving sample efficiency with larger models, even small amounts of mislabeled content could give rise to dangerous capabilities. To address risks associated with mislabeled harmful content, prior work proposed Gradient Routing (Cloud et al., 2024) -- a technique that localizes target knowledge into a dedicated subset of model parameters so they can later be removed. We explore an improved variant of Gradient Routing, which we call Selective GradienT Masking (SGTM), with particular focus on evaluating its robustness to label noise. SGTM zero-masks selected gradients such that target domain examples only update their dedicated parameters. We test SGTM's effectiveness in two applications: removing knowledge of one language from a model trained on a bilingual synthetic dataset, and removing biology knowledge from a model trained on English Wikipedia. In both cases SGTM provides better retain/forget trade-off in the presence of labeling errors compared to both data filtering and a previously proposed instantiation of Gradient Routing. Unlike shallow unlearning approaches that can be quickly undone through fine-tuning, SGTM exhibits strong robustness to adversarial fine-tuning, requiring seven times more fine-tuning steps to reach baseline performance on the forget set compared to a finetuning-based unlearning method (RMU).

However, these approaches rely on autoregressive next-token prediction, which is inherently slow. In this work, we introduce Fast SceneScript, a novel structured language model for accurate and efficient 3D scene layout estimation. Our method employs multi-token prediction (MTP) to reduce the number of autoregressive iterations and significantly accelerate inference. While MTP improves speed, unreliable token predictions can significantly reduce accuracy.

Recent advancements in generative AI, particularly large language model-based assistants and \"copilots\", open new possibilities, as they may enable end users to generate and refine programming code and build apps directly from natural language prompts. This approach, here referred to as AI-assisted end-user coding, promises greater flexibility, broader applicability, faster development, improved reusability, and reduced vendor lock-in compared to the established visual LCNC platforms. This paper investigates whether AI-assisted end-user coding is a feasible paradigm for end-user development, which may complement or even replace the LCNC model in the future. To explore this, we conducted a case study in which non-programmers were asked to develop a basic web app through interaction with AI assistants.The majority of study participants successfully completed the task in reasonable time and also expressed support for AI-assisted end-user coding as a viable approach for end-user development.

Mobile laser scanning (MLS) has shown to be highly promising for extremely accurate, tree level inventory. In this study, we present NormalView, a sensor-agnostic projection-based deep learning method for classifying tree species from point cloud data. NormalView embeds local geometric information into two-dimensional projections, in the form of normal vector estimates, and uses the projections as inputs to an image classification network, YOLOv11. In addition, we inspected the effect of multispectral radiometric intensity information on classification performance. We trained and tested our model on high-density MLS data (7 species, ~5000 pts/m^2), as well as high-density airborne laser scanning (ALS) data (9 species, >1000 pts/m^2). On the MLS data, NormalView achieves an overall accuracy (macro-average accuracy) of 95.5 % (94.8 %), and 91.8 % (79.1 %) on the ALS data. We found that having intensity information from multiple scanners provides benefits in tree species classification, and the best model on the multispectral ALS dataset was a model using intensity information from all three channels of the multispectral ALS. This study demonstrates that projection-based methods, when enhanced with geometric information and coupled with state-of-the-art image classification backbones, can achieve exceptional results.

However, large codebooks and effects caused by reflections or blockages of beams make an optimal beam selection challenging. In contrast to previous work and standardization efforts that opt for supervised learning to train classifiers to predict the next best beam based on previously selected beams we formulate the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and model the environment as the codebook itself. At each time step, we select a candidate beam conditioned on the belief state of the unobservable optimal beam and previously probed beams.

This reliance on costly-to-acquire paired data remains a significant bottleneck. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel, unsupervised training framework based on Optimal Transport capable of training arbitrary ISP architectures in both unpaired and paired modes. We are the first to successfully apply Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) for this complex, cross-domain translation task. Our UOT-based framework provides robustness to outliers in the target sRGB data, allowing it to discount atypical samples that would be prohibitively costly to map. A key component of our framework is a novel ``committee of expert discriminators,'' a hybrid adversarial regularizer. This committee guides the optimal transport mapping by providing specialized, targeted gradients to correct specific ISP failure modes, including color fidelity, structural artifacts, and frequency-domain realism. To demonstrate the superiority of our approach, we retrained existing state-of-the-art ISP architectures using our paired and unpaired setups. Our experiments show that while our framework, when trained in paired mode, exceeds the performance of the original paired methods across all metrics, our unpaired mode concurrently achieves quantitative and qualitative performance that rivals, and in some cases surpasses, the original paired-trained counterparts.

Our pretext task trains a feature extractor solely on camera-captured photographs by classifying categorical EXIF tags (\\eg, camera model and scene type) and pairwise-ranking ordinal and continuous EXIF tags (\\eg, focal length and aperture value). Using these EXIF-induced features, we first perform one-class detection by modeling the distribution of photographic images with a Gaussian mixture model and flagging low-likelihood samples as AI-generated. We then extend to binary detection that treats the learned extractor as a strong regularizer for a classifier of the same architecture, operating on high-frequency residuals from spatially scrambled patches. Extensive experiments across various generative models demonstrate that our EXIF-induced detectors substantially advance the state of the art, delivering strong generalization to in-the-wild samples and robustness to common benign image perturbations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While classical analyses emphasize numerical stability of Jacobian products, we show that stability alone is insufficient: learnability is governed instead by the \\emph{effective learning rates} $\u03bc_{t,\\ell}$, per-lag and per-neuron quantities obtained from first-order expansions of gate-induced Jacobian products in Backpropagation Through Time. These effective learning rates act as multiplicative filters that control both the magnitude and anisotropy of gradient transport. Under heavy-tailed ($\u03b1$-stable) gradient noise, we prove that the minimal sample size required to detect a dependency at lag~$\\ell$ satisfies $N(\\ell)\\propto f(\\ell)^{-\u03b1}$, where $f(\\ell)=\\|\u03bc_{t,\\ell}\\|_1$ is the effective learning rate envelope. This leads to an explicit formula for $\\mathcal{H}_N$ and closed-form scaling laws for logarithmic, polynomial, and exponential decay of $f(\\ell)$. The theory predicts that broader or more heterogeneous gate spectra produce slower decay of $f(\\ell)$ and hence larger learnability windows, whereas heavier-tailed noise compresses $\\mathcal{H}_N$ by slowing statistical concentration. By linking gate-induced time-scale structure, gradient noise, and sample complexity, the framework identifies the effective learning rates as the fundamental quantities that govern when -- and for how long -- gated recurrent networks can learn long-range temporal dependencies.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Despite rapid empirical progress, its theoretical foundations remain limited: existing methods (gradient, distribution, trajectory matching) are built on heterogeneous surrogate objectives and optimization assumptions, which makes it difficult to analyze their common principles or provide general guarantees. Moreover, it is still unclear under what conditions distilled data can retain the effectiveness of full datasets when the training configuration, such as optimizer, architecture, or augmentation, changes. To answer these questions, we propose a unified theoretical framework, termed configuration--dynamics--error analysis, which reformulates major DD approaches under a common generalization-error perspective and provides two main results: (i) a scaling law that provides a single-configuration upper bound, characterizing how the error decreases as the distilled sample size increases and explaining the commonly observed performance saturation effect; and (ii) a coverage law showing that the required distilled sample size scales linearly with configuration diversity, with provably matching upper and lower bounds. In addition, our unified analysis reveals that various matching methods are interchangeable surrogates, reducing the same generalization error, clarifying why they can all achieve dataset distillation and providing guidance on how surrogate choices affect sample efficiency and robustness. Experiments across diverse methods and configurations empirically confirm the derived laws, advancing a theoretical foundation for DD and enabling theory-driven design of compact, configuration-robust dataset distillation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

These aberrations arise from distortions in the optical wavefront and can be mathematically represented using Zernike polynomials. Existing methods often address only mild aberrations on limited sample types and modalities, typically treating the problem as a black-box mapping without leveraging the underlying optical physics of wavefront distortions. We propose ZRNet, a physics-informed framework that jointly performs Zernike coefficient prediction and optical image Restoration. We contribute a Zernike Graph module that explicitly models physical relationships between Zernike polynomials based on their azimuthal degrees-ensuring that learned corrections align with fundamental optical principles. To further enforce physical consistency between image restoration and Zernike prediction, we introduce a Frequency-Aware Alignment (FAA) loss, which better aligns Zernike coefficient prediction and image features in the Fourier domain. Extensive experiments on CytoImageNet demonstrates that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both image restoration and Zernike coefficient prediction across diverse microscopy modalities and biological samples with complex, large-amplitude aberrations.

However, their high computational and memory costs pose challenges for deployment. Model quantization has emerged as a promising solution to reduce storage overhead and accelerate inference. Nevertheless, existing quantization methods for diffusion models struggle to mitigate outliers in activation matrices during inference, leading to substantial performance degradation under low-bit quantization scenarios. To address this, we propose HQ-DM, a novel Quantization-Aware Training framework that applies Single Hadamard Transformation to activation matrices.

However, it remains an open question of how to best determine which of the many possible model checkpoints resulting from a large training run to use as the starting point. This becomes especially important when data for the target task of interest is scarce, unlabeled and out-of-distribution. In such scenarios, common methods relying on in-distribution validation data become unreliable or inapplicable. This work proposes a novel approach for model selection that operates reliably on just a few unlabeled examples from the target task. Our approach is based on a novel concept: Neural Coherence, which entails characterizing a model's activation statistics for source and target domains, allowing one to define model selection methods with high data-efficiency. We provide experiments where models are pre-trained on ImageNet1K and examine target domains consisting of Food-101, PlantNet-300K and iNaturalist. We also evaluate it in many meta-learning settings. Our approach significantly improves generalization across these different target domains compared to established baselines. We further demonstrate the versatility of Neural Coherence as a powerful principle by showing its effectiveness in training data selection.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While agentic pipelines improve video reasoning capabilities, prevailing frameworks rely on a query-agnostic captioner to perceive video information, which wastes computation on irrelevant content and blurs fine-grained temporal and spatial information. Motivated by active perception theory, we argue that LVU agents should actively decide what, when, and where to observe, and continuously assess whether the current observation is sufficient to answer the query. We present Active Video Perception (AVP), an evidence-seeking framework that treats the video as an interactive environment and acquires compact, queryrelevant evidence directly from pixels. Concretely, AVP runs an iterative plan-observe-reflect process with MLLM agents. In each round, a planner proposes targeted video interactions, an observer executes them to extract time-stamped evidence, and a reflector evaluates the sufficiency of the evidence for the query, either halting with an answer or triggering further observation. Across five LVU benchmarks, AVP achieves highest performance with significant improvements. Notably, AVP outperforms the best agentic method by 5.7% in average accuracy while only requires 18.4% inference time and 12.4% input tokens.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing accelerators -- such as sparse attention and step-distilled samplers -- typically target a single dimension in isolation and quickly encounter diminishing returns, as the remaining bottlenecks become dominant. In this work, we introduce USV (Unified Sparsification for Video diffusion models), an end-to-end trainable framework that overcomes this limitation by jointly orchestrating sparsification across both the model's internal computation and its sampling process. USV learns a dynamic, data- and timestep-dependent sparsification policy that prunes redundant attention connections, adaptively merges semantically similar tokens, and reduces denoising steps, treating them not as independent tricks but as coordinated actions within a single optimization objective. This multi-dimensional co-design enables strong mutual reinforcement among previously disjoint acceleration strategies. Extensive experiments on large-scale video generation benchmarks demonstrate that USV achieves up to 83.3% speedup in the denoising process and 22.7% end-to-end acceleration, while maintaining high visual fidelity.

Recent approaches such as MindJourney attempt to mitigate this gap through test-time scaling where a world model imagines action-conditioned trajectories and a heuristic verifier selects helpful views from such trajectories. In this work, we systematically examine how such test-time verifiers behave across benchmarks, uncovering both their promise and their pitfalls. Our uncertainty-based analyses show that MindJourney's verifier provides little meaningful calibration, and that random scoring often reduces answer entropy equally well, thus exposing systematic action biases and unreliable reward signals. To mitigate these, we introduce a Verification through Spatial Assertions (ViSA) framework that grounds the test-time reward in verifiable, frame-anchored micro-claims. This principled verifier consistently improves spatial reasoning on the SAT-Real benchmark and corrects trajectory-selection biases through more balanced exploratory behavior. However, on the challenging MMSI-Bench, none of the verifiers, including ours, achieve consistent scaling, suggesting that the current world models form an information bottleneck where imagined views fail to enrich fine-grained reasoning. Together, these findings chart the bad, good, and ugly aspects of test-time verification for world-model-based reasoning.

An emerging approach to address this problem relies on \\emph{disagreement discrepancy} -- a measure of how the disagreement between two models changes under a shifting distribution. The process of maximizing this measure has seen applications in bounding error under shifts, testing for harmful shifts, and training more robust models. However, this optimization involves the non-differentiable zero-one loss, necessitating the use of practical surrogate losses. We prove that existing surrogates for disagreement discrepancy are not Bayes consistent, revealing a fundamental flaw: maximizing these surrogates can fail to maximize the true disagreement discrepancy. To address this, we introduce new theoretical results providing both upper and lower bounds on the optimality gap for such surrogates. Guided by this theory, we propose a novel disagreement loss that, when paired with cross-entropy, yields a provably consistent surrogate for disagreement discrepancy. Empirical evaluations across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method provides more accurate and robust estimates of disagreement discrepancy than existing approaches, particularly under challenging adversarial conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, most CTVG methods assume that personalized concepts remain static and do not expand incrementally over time. Additionally, they struggle with forgetting and concept neglect when continuously learning new concepts, including subjects and motions. To resolve the above challenges, we develop a novel Continual Customized Video Diffusion (CCVD) model, which can continuously learn new concepts to generate videos across various text-to-video generation tasks by tackling forgetting and concept neglect. To address catastrophic forgetting, we introduce a concept-specific attribute retention module and a task-aware concept aggregation strategy. They can capture the unique characteristics and identities of old concepts during training, while combining all subject and motion adapters of old concepts based on their relevance during testing. Besides, to tackle concept neglect, we develop a controllable conditional synthesis to enhance regional features and align video contexts with user conditions, by incorporating layer-specific region attention-guided noise estimation.

However, most existing classification frameworks face challenges in multicenter studies, as they often neglect inter-site heterogeneity and lack mechanisms to quantify uncertainty, which limits their robustness and clinical applicability. To address these issues, we proposed Uncertainty-Guided Federated Domain Adaptation (UG-FedDA), a novel multicenter AD classification framework that integrates uncertainty quantification (UQ) with federated domain adaptation to handle cross-site structure magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) heterogeneity under privacy constraints. Our approach extracts multi-template region-of-interest (RoI) features using a self-attention transformer, capturing both regional representations and their interactions. UQ is integrated to guide feature alignment, mitigating source-target distribution shifts by down-weighting uncertain samples. Experiments are conducted on three public datasets: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), the Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle study (AIBL), and the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS). UG-FedDA achieved consistent cross-domain improvements in accuracy, sensitivity, and area under the ROC curve across three classification tasks: AD vs. normal controls (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) vs. AD, and NC vs. MCI. For NC vs. AD, UG-FedDA achieves accuracies of 90.54%, 89.04%, and 77.78% on ADNI, AIBL and OASIS datasets, respectively.

To sustain this ecosystem, we need fair mechanisms to attribute and compensate content providers based on their contributions to generated answers.

MaxShapley is a special case of the celebrated Shapley value; it leverages a decomposable max-sum utility function to compute attributions with linear computation in the number of documents, as opposed to the exponential cost of Shapley values. We evaluate MaxShapley on three multi-hop QA datasets (HotPotQA, MuSiQUE, MS MARCO); MaxShapley achieves comparable attribution quality to exact Shapley computation, while consuming a fraction of its tokens--for instance, it gives up to an 8x reduction in resource consumption over prior state-of-the-art methods at the same attribution accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Despite these exceptional capabilities, controllable video models often hallucinate - generating future video frames that are misaligned with physical reality - which raises serious concerns in many tasks such as robot policy evaluation and planning. However, state-of-the-art video models lack the ability to assess and express their confidence, impeding hallucination mitigation. To rigorously address this challenge, we propose C3, an uncertainty quantification (UQ) method for training continuous-scale calibrated controllable video models for dense confidence estimation at the subpatch level, precisely localizing the uncertainty in each generated video frame. Our UQ method introduces three core innovations to empower video models to estimate their uncertainty. First, our method develops a novel framework that trains video models for correctness and calibration via strictly proper scoring rules. Second, we estimate the video model's uncertainty in latent space, avoiding training instability and prohibitive training costs associated with pixel-space approaches. Third, we map the dense latent-space uncertainty to interpretable pixel-level uncertainty in the RGB space for intuitive visualization, providing high-resolution uncertainty heatmaps that identify untrustworthy regions. Through extensive experiments on large-scale robot learning datasets (Bridge and DROID) and real-world evaluations, we demonstrate that our method not only provides calibrated uncertainty estimates within the training distribution, but also enables effective out-of-distribution detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we instead begin from an explicit target distribution, obtained by filtering out incorrect answers while preserving the relative probabilities of correct ones. Starting from a pre-trained LLM, we approximate this target distribution using the $\u03b1$-divergence family, which unifies prior approaches and enables direct control of the precision-diversity trade-off by interpolating between mode-seeking and mass-covering divergences.

To fully evaluate potential safety risks in the visual reasoning task, we propose Visual Reasoning Sequential Attack (VRSA), which induces MLLMs to gradually externalize and aggregate complete harmful intent by decomposing the original harmful text into several sequentially related sub-images.

While editing in the RAW domain provides greater accuracy and flexibility, most edits are performed on the camera's display-referred output (e.g., 8-bit sRGB JPEG) since RAW images are rarely stored. Existing RAW reconstruction methods can recover RAW data from sRGB images, but these approaches are typically optimized for pixel-wise RAW reconstruction fidelity and tend to degrade under diverse rendering styles and editing operations. We introduce a plug-and-play, edit-aware loss function that can be integrated into any existing RAW reconstruction framework to make the recovered RAWs more robust to different rendering styles and edits. Our loss formulation incorporates a modular, differentiable image signal processor (ISP) that simulates realistic photofinishing pipelines with tunable parameters. During training, parameters for each ISP module are randomly sampled from carefully designed distributions that model practical variations in real camera processing. The loss is then computed in sRGB space between ground-truth and reconstructed RAWs rendered through this differentiable ISP. Incorporating our loss improves sRGB reconstruction quality by up to 1.5-2 dB PSNR across various editing conditions. Moreover, when applied to metadata-assisted RAW reconstruction methods, our approach enables fine-tuning for target edits, yielding further gains.

Simultaneously, existing deep learning models exhibit high computational complexity, which limits their practical deployment for real-time underwater applications. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel underwater image enhancement model, called Adaptive Frequency Fusion and Illumination Aware Network (AQUA-Net). It integrates a residual encoder decoder with dual auxiliary branches, which operate in the frequency and illumination domains. The frequency fusion encoder enriches spatial representations with frequency cues from the Fourier domain and preserves fine textures and structural details. Inspired by Retinex, the illumination-aware decoder performs adaptive exposure correction through a learned illumination map that separates reflectance from lighting effects. This joint spatial, frequency, and illumination design enables the model to restore color balance, visual contrast, and perceptual realism under diverse underwater conditions. Additionally, we present a high-resolution, real-world underwater video-derived dataset from the Mediterranean Sea, which captures challenging deep-sea conditions with realistic visual degradations to enable robust evaluation and development of deep learning models. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that AQUA-Net performs on par with SOTA in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations while using less number of parameters.

To address these limitations, we propose Neural Implicit Craniofacial Model (NICE) which employs implicit neural representations for accurate anatomical reconstruction and surgical outcome prediction. NICE comprises a shape module, which employs region-specific implicit Signed Distance Function (SDF) decoders to reconstruct the facial surface, maxilla, and mandible, and a surgery module, which employs region-specific deformation decoders. These deformation decoders are driven by a shared surgical latent code to effectively model the complex, nonlinear biomechanical response of the facial surface to skeletal movements, incorporating anatomical prior knowledge. The deformation decoders output point-wise displacement fields, enabling precise modeling of surgical outcomes.

In particular, the latter opens up applications in the context of explainable AI (XAI) and robustness tests due to the possibility of evaluating the sensitivity to parameter changes, which we demonstrate with experiments. Our resulting synthetic traffic sign recognition dataset Synset Signset Germany contains a total of 105500 images of 211 different German traffic sign classes, including newly published (2020) and thus comparatively rare traffic signs. In addition to a mask and a segmentation image, we also provide extensive metadata including the stochastically selected environment and imaging effect parameters for each image. We evaluate the degree of realism of Synset Signset Germany on the real-world German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) and in comparison to CATERED, a state-of-the-art synthetic traffic sign recognition dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing approaches improve instruction adherence via supervised or reinforcement learning, yet single-turn success rates remain limited due to inherent stochasticity and a lack of deliberation. In this work, we propose a deliberative editing framework to 'think' while they edit, which simulates the human cognitive loop by iteratively executing a Think-while-Edit cycle: Critiquing results and Refining instructions , followed by Repeating the generation until satisfactory. Specifically, we train a single MLLM, EditThinker, to act as the reasoning engine of this framework, which jointly produce the critique score, reasoning process, and refined instructions. We employ reinforcement learning to align the EditThinker's thinking with its editing, thereby generating more targeted instruction improvements. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the instruction-following capability of any image editing model by a large margin. We will release our data construction framework, datasets, and models to benefit the community.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd'\u601d\u8003\u578b'\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7'\u8fb9\u601d\u8003\u8fb9\u7f16\u8f91'\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aEditThinker\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u53d7\u76ca\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u800c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u7f8e\u5b66\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5df2\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u6216\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6539\u8fdb\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u968f\u673a\u6027\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u601d\u8003\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5355\u8f6e\u6210\u529f\u7387\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd'\u601d\u8003\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6'\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u6267\u884cThink-while-Edit\u5faa\u73af\uff08\u6279\u5224\u7ed3\u679c\u3001\u7ec6\u5316\u6307\u4ee4\u3001\u91cd\u590d\u751f\u6210\u76f4\u5230\u6ee1\u610f\uff09\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u7f16\u8f91\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u4e00\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bEditThinker\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u751f\u6210\u6279\u5224\u8bc4\u5206\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u7ec6\u5316\u6307\u4ee4\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u5176\u601d\u8003\u4e0e\u7f16\u8f91\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4efb\u4f55\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8f83\u5927\u5e45\u5ea6\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165'\u601d\u8003\u578b'\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\u548cEditThinker\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u627f\u8bfa\u5c06\u53d1\u5e03\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u793e\u533a\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}
