Abstract: Culverts and sewer pipes are critical components of drainage systems, and their failure can lead to serious risks to public safety and the environment. In this thesis, we explore methods to improve automated defect segmentation in culverts and sewer pipes. Collecting and annotating data in this field is cumbersome and requires domain knowledge. Having a large dataset for structural defect detection is therefore not feasible. Our proposed methods are tested under conditions with limited annotated data to demonstrate applicability to real-world scenarios. Overall, this thesis proposes three methods to significantly enhance defect segmentation and handle data scarcity. This can be addressed either by enhancing the training data or by adjusting a models architecture.
  First, we evaluate preprocessing strategies, including traditional data augmentation and dynamic label injection. These techniques significantly improve segmentation performance, increasing both Intersection over Union (IoU) and F1 score. Second, we introduce FORTRESS, a novel architecture that combines depthwise separable convolutions, adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN), and multi-scale attention mechanisms. FORTRESS achieves state-of-the-art performance on the culvert sewer pipe defect dataset, while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters, as well as its computational cost. Finally, we investigate few-shot semantic segmentation and its applicability to defect detection. Few-shot learning aims to train models with only limited data available. By employing a bidirectional prototypical network with attention mechanisms, the model achieves richer feature representations and achieves satisfactory results across evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated strong performance on a wide range of vision-language tasks, raising interest in their potential use for biometric applications. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art MLLMs for heterogeneous face recognition (HFR), where enrollment and probe images are from different sensing modalities, including visual (VIS), near infrared (NIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and thermal camera. We benchmark multiple open-source MLLMs across several cross-modality scenarios, including VIS-NIR, VIS-SWIR, and VIS-THERMAL face recognition. The recognition performance of MLLMs is evaluated using biometric protocols and based on different metrics, including Acquire Rate, Equal Error Rate (EER), and True Accept Rate (TAR). Our results reveal substantial performance gaps between MLLMs and classical face recognition systems, particularly under challenging cross-spectral conditions, in spite of recent advances in MLLMs. Our findings highlight the limitations of current MLLMs for HFR and also the importance of rigorous biometric evaluation when considering their deployment in face recognition systems.

Method: CURE通过公共数据集对多模态指令模型进行微调，包括短语基础、基础报告生成和解剖学基础报告生成三个阶段，采用动态调整采样策略，基于模型性能强调更难的样本以提高空间和文本对齐。

Result: CURE将基础准确性提高了+0.37 IoU，报告质量提升了+0.188 CXRFEScore，幻觉减少了18.6%。

Conclusion: CURE是一种数据高效框架，无需额外数据即可显著提升医学影像报告的基础准确性和报告可靠性，模型权重和代码已公开。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models can automate the generation of radiology reports but struggle with accurate visual grounding and factual consistency. Existing models often misalign textual findings with visual evidence, leading to unreliable or weakly grounded predictions. We present CURE, an error-aware curriculum learning framework that improves grounding and report quality without any additional data. CURE fine-tunes a multimodal instructional model on phrase grounding, grounded report generation, and anatomy-grounded report generation using public datasets. The method dynamically adjusts sampling based on model performance, emphasizing harder samples to improve spatial and textual alignment. CURE improves grounding accuracy by +0.37 IoU, boosts report quality by +0.188 CXRFEScore, and reduces hallucinations by 18.6%. CURE is a data-efficient framework that enhances both grounding accuracy and report reliability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了DuFal（双频感知学习）框架，通过双路径架构整合频域和空间域处理，解决稀疏视角CBCT重建中高频细节恢复的挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN方法偏向学习低频信息，难以恢复稀疏视角CBCT重建中的高频解剖细节

Method: 开发了高局部分解傅里叶神经算子（HLF-FNO），包含全局高频增强分支和局部高频增强分支；设计了谱通道分解方案减少参数；采用交叉注意力频率融合模块整合空间和频率特征；最终通过强度场解码管道重建CT体数据

Result: 在LUNA16和ToothFairy数据集上，DuFal在极稀疏视角设置下显著优于现有SOTA方法，能更好地保留高频解剖特征

Conclusion: DuFal框架能有效解决稀疏视角CBCT重建中高频信息恢复的难题，为医学影像重建提供了创新方案

Abstract: Sparse-view Cone-Beam Computed Tomography reconstruction from limited X-ray projections remains a challenging problem in medical imaging due to the inherent undersampling of fine-grained anatomical details, which correspond to high-frequency components. Conventional CNN-based methods often struggle to recover these fine structures, as they are typically biased toward learning low-frequency information. To address this challenge, this paper presents DuFal (Dual-Frequency-Aware Learning), a novel framework that integrates frequency-domain and spatial-domain processing via a dual-path architecture. The core innovation lies in our High-Local Factorized Fourier Neural Operator, which comprises two complementary branches: a Global High-Frequency Enhanced Fourier Neural Operator that captures global frequency patterns and a Local High-Frequency Enhanced Fourier Neural Operator that processes spatially partitioned patches to preserve spatial locality that might be lost in global frequency analysis. To improve efficiency, we design a Spectral-Channel Factorization scheme that reduces the Fourier Neural Operator parameter count. We also design a Cross-Attention Frequency Fusion module to integrate spatial and frequency features effectively. The fused features are then decoded through a Feature Decoder to produce projection representations, which are subsequently processed through an Intensity Field Decoding pipeline to reconstruct a final Computed Tomography volume. Experimental results on the LUNA16 and ToothFairy datasets demonstrate that DuFal significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in preserving high-frequency anatomical features, particularly under extremely sparse-view settings.

*Morteza Poudineh,Marc Lalonde*

TL;DR: 提出了一个融合视觉-语言模型与偏差统计的少样本异常检测框架，通过可学习提示词和偏差引导的损失函数提升异常定位能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CLIP的少样本异常检测方法存在正常/异常提示区分度弱、缺乏原理性评分机制的问题，难以应对有限监督和多样缺陷的挑战

Method: 提出偏差引导的提示学习框架：1) 使用可学习上下文向量替代固定提示前缀；2) 引入异常特定的后缀令牌实现类别感知对齐；3) 结合Top-K多重实例学习的偏差损失，将补丁特征建模为高斯分布偏差

Result: 在MVTecAD和VISA基准测试中取得优于PromptAD等基线的像素级检测性能，消融实验验证了可学习提示、偏差评分和Top-K MIL策略的有效性

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合视觉-语言模型的语义能力和偏差统计的可靠性，显著提高了少样本异常检测的区分度和可解释性，为工业缺陷检测等应用提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Few-normal shot anomaly detection (FNSAD) aims to detect abnormal regions in images using only a few normal training samples, making the task highly challenging due to limited supervision and the diversity of potential defects. Recent approaches leverage vision-language models such as CLIP with prompt-based learning to align image and text features. However, existing methods often exhibit weak discriminability between normal and abnormal prompts and lack principled scoring mechanisms for patch-level anomalies. We propose a deviation-guided prompt learning framework that integrates the semantic power of vision-language models with the statistical reliability of deviation-based scoring. Specifically, we replace fixed prompt prefixes with learnable context vectors shared across normal and abnormal prompts, while anomaly-specific suffix tokens enable class-aware alignment. To enhance separability, we introduce a deviation loss with Top-K Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), modeling patch-level features as Gaussian deviations from the normal distribution. This allows the network to assign higher anomaly scores to patches with statistically significant deviations, improving localization and interpretability. Experiments on the MVTecAD and VISA benchmarks demonstrate superior pixel-level detection performance compared to PromptAD and other baselines. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of learnable prompts, deviation-based scoring, and the Top-K MIL strategy.

TL;DR: LASAGNA是一个统一框架，能够同时生成图像及其组成图层（逼真的背景和高质量透明前景），提供更好的可控性和一致性，并支持物理真实的视觉效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像生成模型在编辑现有图像中的特定元素时，常常难以产生可控且一致的结果。现有的分层表示方法在合成关系上不够连贯，且对象图层缺乏真实的视觉效果（如阴影和反射）。

Method: 提出了LASAGNA框架，通过从多种条件输入（文本提示、前景、背景和位置遮罩）中高效学习正确的图像合成方式。同时构建了LASAGNA-48K数据集（包含干净背景和具有物理真实效果的RGBA前景）和LASAGNABENCH评估基准。

Conclusion: LASAGNA通过分层表示解决了图像编辑中的可控性和一致性问题，提供了更好的用户体验。相关数据集和评估基准将被公开发布以促进社区研究。

Abstract: Recent image generation models have shown impressive progress, yet they often struggle to yield controllable and consistent results when users attempt to edit specific elements within an existing image. Layered representations enable flexible, user-driven content creation, but existing approaches often fail to produce layers with coherent compositing relationships, and their object layers typically lack realistic visual effects such as shadows and reflections. To overcome these limitations, we propose LASAGNA, a novel, unified framework that generates an image jointly with its composing layers--a photorealistic background and a high-quality transparent foreground with compelling visual effects. Unlike prior work, LASAGNA efficiently learns correct image composition from a wide range of conditioning inputs--text prompts, foreground, background, and location masks--offering greater controllability for real-world applications. To enable this, we introduce LASAGNA-48K, a new dataset composed of clean backgrounds and RGBA foregrounds with physically grounded visual effects. We also propose LASAGNABENCH, the first benchmark for layer editing. We demonstrate that LASAGNA excels in generating highly consistent and coherent results across multiple image layers simultaneously, enabling diverse post-editing applications that accurately preserve identity and visual effects. LASAGNA-48K and LASAGNABENCH will be publicly released to foster open research in the community. The project page is https://rayjryang.github.io/LASAGNA-Page/.

Abstract: The proliferation of XR devices has made egocentric hand pose estimation a vital task, yet this perspective is inherently challenged by frequent finger occlusions. To address this, we propose a novel approach that leverages the rich information in dorsal hand skin deformation, unlocked by recent advances in dense visual featurizers. We introduce a dual-stream delta encoder that learns pose by contrasting features from a dynamic hand with a baseline relaxed position. Our evaluation demonstrates that, using only cropped dorsal images, our method reduces the Mean Per Joint Angle Error (MPJAE) by 18% in self-occluded scenarios (fingers >=50% occluded) compared to state-of-the-art techniques that depend on the whole hand's geometry and large model backbones. Consequently, our method not only enhances the reliability of downstream tasks like index finger pinch and tap estimation in occluded scenarios but also unlocks new interaction paradigms, such as detecting isometric force for a surface "click" without visible movement while minimizing model size.

Abstract: Generalizing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to novel video domains is essential for real-world deployment but remains challenging due to the scarcity of labeled data. While In-Context Learning (ICL) offers a training-free adaptation path, standard methods rely on large annotated pools, which are often impractical in specialized environments like industrial or surgical settings since they require the experts' annotations. To bridge this gap, we introduce VIOLA (Video In-cOntext Learning with minimal Annotation), a label-efficient framework that synergizes minimal expert supervision with abundant unlabeled data. First, to maximize the efficiency of a strict annotation budget, we propose density-uncertainty-weighted sampling. Unlike standard diversity or uncertainty strategies that risk selecting visual outliers, our method leverages density estimation to identify samples that are simultaneously diverse, representative, and informative. Second, to utilize the remaining unlabeled data without noise propagation, we construct a hybrid pool and introduce confidence-aware retrieval and confidence-aware prompting. These mechanisms explicitly model label reliability, retrieving demonstrations based on a composite score of similarity and confidence while enabling the MLLM to adaptively distinguish between verified ground truths and noisy pseudo-labels. Extensive experiments across nine diverse benchmarks using four MLLMs demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms various baselines in low-resource settings, achieving robust adaptation with minimal annotation costs.

TL;DR: 本文分析了条件扩散模型在细粒度人脸生成中的身份一致性缺陷，提出了相对分类准确率(RCA)指标来评估语义可控性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成模型评估指标（如FID和IS）在评估细粒度、单领域任务的身份一致性时存在不足，本文旨在解决这一缺陷。

Method: 使用类别条件DDPM生成K-pop偶像人脸（32x32），并提出相对分类准确率(RCA)指标，通过对比随机分类器的性能来校准评估结果。

Result: 模型在视觉质量上表现出色（FID 8.93），但在语义模式上存在严重塌陷（RCA 0.27），特别是在视觉模糊的身份类别中。

Conclusion: RCA框架为条件生成模型的身份一致性验证提供了严格标准，揭示了高分辨率需求和类内模糊性是身份错位的关键因素。

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have achieved remarkable success in high-fidelity image generation. However, evaluating their semantic controllability-specifically for fine-grained, single-domain tasks-remains challenging. Standard metrics like FID and Inception Score (IS) often fail to detect identity misalignment in such specialized contexts. In this work, we investigate Class-Conditional DDPMs for K-pop idol face generation (32x32), a domain characterized by high inter-class similarity. We propose a calibrated metric, Relative Classification Accuracy (RCA), which normalizes generative performance against an oracle classifier's baseline. Our evaluation reveals a critical trade-off: while the model achieves high visual quality (FID 8.93), it suffers from severe semantic mode collapse (RCA 0.27), particularly for visually ambiguous identities. We analyze these failure modes through confusion matrices and attribute them to resolution constraints and intra-gender ambiguity. Our framework provides a rigorous standard for verifying identity consistency in conditional generative models.

Abstract: Most prior deepfake detection methods lack explainable outputs. With the growing interest in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), researchers have started exploring their use in interpretable deepfake detection. However, a major obstacle in applying MLLMs to this task is the scarcity of high-quality datasets with detailed forgery attribution annotations, as textual annotation is both costly and challenging - particularly for high-fidelity forged images or videos. Moreover, multiple studies have shown that reinforcement learning (RL) can substantially enhance performance in visual tasks, especially in improving cross-domain generalization. To facilitate the adoption of mainstream MLLM frameworks in deepfake detection with reduced annotation cost, and to investigate the potential of RL in this context, we propose an automated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data generation framework based on Self-Blended Images, along with an RL-enhanced deepfake detection framework. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our CoT data construction pipeline, tailored reward mechanism, and feedback-driven synthetic data generation approach. Our method achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches across multiple cross-dataset benchmarks. Implementation details are available at https://github.com/deon1219/rlsbi.

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) is a great endeavour in developing intelligent perception AI systems. However, the pioneer research has predominantly focus on single-task CL, which restricts the potential in multi-task and multimodal scenarios. Beyond the well-known issue of catastrophic forgetting, the multi-task CL also brings semantic obfuscation across multimodal alignment, leading to severe model degradation during incremental training steps. In this paper, we extend CL to continual panoptic perception (CPP), integrating multimodal and multi-task CL to enhance comprehensive image perception through pixel-level, instance-level, and image-level joint interpretation. We formalize the CL task in multimodal scenarios and propose an end-to-end continual panoptic perception model. Concretely, CPP model features a collaborative cross-modal encoder (CCE) for multimodal embedding. We also propose a malleable knowledge inheritance module via contrastive feature distillation and instance distillation, addressing catastrophic forgetting from task-interactive boosting manner. Furthermore, we propose a cross-modal consistency constraint and develop CPP+, ensuring multimodal semantic alignment for model updating under multi-task incremental scenarios. Additionally, our proposed model incorporates an asymmetric pseudo-labeling manner, enabling model evolving without exemplar replay. Extensive experiments on multimodal datasets and diverse CL tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model, particularly in fine-grained CL tasks.

Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction plays a pivotal role in the realm of autonomous driving, as it provides a comprehensive understanding of the driving environment. Most existing methods construct dense scene representations for occupancy prediction, overlooking the inherent sparsity of real-world driving scenes. Recently, 3D superquadric representation has emerged as a promising sparse alternative to dense scene representations due to the strong geometric expressiveness of superquadrics. However, existing superquadric frameworks still suffer from insufficient temporal modeling, a challenging trade-off between query sparsity and geometric expressiveness, and inefficient superquadric-to-voxel splatting. To address these issues, we propose SuperOcc, a novel framework for superquadric-based 3D occupancy prediction. SuperOcc incorporates three key designs: (1) a cohesive temporal modeling mechanism to simultaneously exploit view-centric and object-centric temporal cues; (2) a multi-superquadric decoding strategy to enhance geometric expressiveness without sacrificing query sparsity; and (3) an efficient superquadric-to-voxel splatting scheme to improve computational efficiency. Extensive experiments on the SurroundOcc and Occ3D benchmarks demonstrate that SuperOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining superior efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/Yzichen/SuperOcc.

Abstract: Real-time understanding of long video streams remains challenging for multimodal large language models (VLMs) due to redundant frame processing and rapid forgetting of past context. Existing streaming systems rely on fixed-interval decoding or cache pruning, which either produce repetitive outputs or discard crucial temporal information. We introduce Event-VStream, an event-aware framework that represents continuous video as a sequence of discrete, semantically coherent events. Our system detects meaningful state transitions by integrating motion, semantic, and predictive cues, and triggers language generation only at those boundaries. Each event embedding is consolidated into a persistent memory bank, enabling long-horizon reasoning while maintaining low latency. Across OVOBench-Realtime, and long-form Ego4D evaluations, Event-VStream achieves competitive performance. It improves over a VideoLLM-Online-8B baseline by +10.4 points on OVOBench-Realtime, achieves performance close to Flash-VStream-7B despite using only a general-purpose LLaMA-3-8B text backbone, and maintains around 70% GPT-5 win rate on 2-hour Ego4D streams.

Abstract: The recent surge in popularity of Nano-Banana and Seedream 4.0 underscores the community's strong interest in multi-image composition tasks. Compared to single-image editing, multi-image composition presents significantly greater challenges in terms of consistency and quality, yet existing models have not disclosed specific methodological details for achieving high-quality fusion. Through statistical analysis, we identify Human-Object Interaction (HOI) as the most sought-after category by the community. We therefore systematically analyze and implement a state-of-the-art solution for multi-image composition with a primary focus on HOI-centric tasks. We present Skywork UniPic 3.0, a unified multimodal framework that integrates single-image editing and multi-image composition. Our model supports an arbitrary (1~6) number and resolution of input images, as well as arbitrary output resolutions (within a total pixel budget of 1024x1024). To address the challenges of multi-image composition, we design a comprehensive data collection, filtering, and synthesis pipeline, achieving strong performance with only 700K high-quality training samples. Furthermore, we introduce a novel training paradigm that formulates multi-image composition as a sequence-modeling problem, transforming conditional generation into unified sequence synthesis. To accelerate inference, we integrate trajectory mapping and distribution matching into the post-training stage, enabling the model to produce high-fidelity samples in just 8 steps and achieve a 12.5x speedup over standard synthesis sampling. Skywork UniPic 3.0 achieves state-of-the-art performance on single-image editing benchmark and surpasses both Nano-Banana and Seedream 4.0 on multi-image composition benchmark, thereby validating the effectiveness of our data pipeline and training paradigm. Code, models and dataset are publicly available.

Abstract: Few-shot recognition in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery remains a critical bottleneck for real-world applications due to extreme data scarcity. A promising strategy involves synthesizing a large dataset with a generative adversarial network (GAN), pre-training a model via self-supervised learning (SSL), and then fine-tuning on the few labeled samples. However, this approach faces a fundamental paradox: conventional GANs themselves require abundant data for stable training, contradicting the premise of few-shot learning. To resolve this, we propose the consistency-regularized generative adversarial network (Cr-GAN), a novel framework designed to synthesize diverse, high-fidelity samples even when trained under these severe data limitations. Cr-GAN introduces a dual-branch discriminator that decouples adversarial training from representation learning. This architecture enables a channel-wise feature interpolation strategy to create novel latent features, complemented by a dual-domain cycle consistency mechanism that ensures semantic integrity. Our Cr-GAN framework is adaptable to various GAN architectures, and its synthesized data effectively boosts multiple SSL algorithms. Extensive experiments on the MSTAR and SRSDD datasets validate our approach, with Cr-GAN achieving a highly competitive accuracy of 71.21% and 51.64%, respectively, in the 8-shot setting, significantly outperforming leading baselines, while requiring only ~5 of the parameters of state-of-the-art diffusion models.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has introduced complex security challenges, particularly at the intersection of textual and visual safety. While existing schemes have explored the security vulnerabilities of MLLMs, the investigation into their visual safety boundaries remains insufficient. In this paper, we propose Beyond Visual Safety (BVS), a novel image-text pair jailbreaking framework specifically designed to probe the visual safety boundaries of MLLMs. BVS employs a "reconstruction-then-generation" strategy, leveraging neutralized visual splicing and inductive recomposition to decouple malicious intent from raw inputs, thereby leading MLLMs to be induced into generating harmful images. Experimental results demonstrate that BVS achieves a remarkable jailbreak success rate of 98.21\% against GPT-5 (12 January 2026 release). Our findings expose critical vulnerabilities in the visual safety alignment of current MLLMs.

Conclusion: 提出的三个轻量级改进能有效提升SAR数据的土地利用/土地覆盖语义分割性能，特别是对罕见类别和细长结构的检测效果

Abstract: This work focuses on national-scale land-use/land-cover (LULC) semantic segmentation using ALOS-2 single-polarization (HH) SAR data over Japan, together with a companion binary water detection task. Building on SAR-W-MixMAE self-supervised pretraining [1], we address common SAR dense-prediction failure modes, boundary over-smoothing, missed thin/slender structures, and rare-class degradation under long-tailed labels, without increasing pipeline complexity. We introduce three lightweight refinements: (i) injecting high-resolution features into multi-scale decoding, (ii) a progressive refine-up head that alternates convolutional refinement and stepwise upsampling, and (iii) an $α$-scale factor that tempers class reweighting within a focal+dice objective. The resulting model yields consistent improvements on the Japan-wide ALOS-2 LULC benchmark, particularly for under-represented classes, and improves water detection across standard evaluation metrics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文评估了视觉语言模型（VLM）在细粒度时尚属性预测任务中的表现，重点考察了其对属性适用性的检测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在时尚零售应用中，精准的属性预测对商品目录完善、视觉搜索和推荐系统至关重要。传统的视觉语言模型在零样本设置下虽能完成预测，但其在多属性时尚任务中的系统性评估仍不足，尤其在处理属性适用性条件判断（如某些属性在特定场景下不适用）方面存在挑战。

Method: 研究者引入了一个三层评估框架，将任务分解为：（1）整体任务性能（包含NA类）；（2）属性适用性检测；（3）属性可确定时的细粒度分类。基于DeepFashion-MultiModal数据集（明确包含NA标签），对九个不同规模的VLM模型（包括旗舰、高效和超高效版本）进行了基准测试，并与基于预训练Fashion-CLIP嵌入的分类器进行了对比。实验涉及5000张图像和18个属性。

Result: 结果显示：（1）零样本VLM获得了64.0%的宏观F1分数，比基于Fashion-CLIP嵌入的逻辑回归模型提高了三倍；（2）VLM在细粒度分类任务（第三层：70.8% F1）表现出色，但在属性适用性检测（第二层：34.1% NA-F1）方面存在瓶颈；（3）高效模型能以更低的成本达到旗舰模型90%以上的性能，为实际部署提供了可行路径。

Conclusion: 该诊断框架有助于实践者准确定位错误来源（是可见性检测问题还是分类问题），从而指导生产系统的针对性改进。研究表明，当前VLM的主要瓶颈在于属性适用性检测，而高效模型在成本可控的情况下提供了有竞争力的性能，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Fine-grained attribute prediction is essential for fashion retail applications including catalog enrichment, visual search, and recommendation systems. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer zero-shot prediction without task-specific training, yet their systematic evaluation on multi-attribute fashion tasks remains underexplored. A key challenge is that fashion attributes are often conditional. For example, "outer fabric" is undefined when no outer garment is visible. This requires models to detect attribute applicability before attempting classification. We introduce a three-tier evaluation framework that decomposes this challenge: (1) overall task performance across all classes (including NA class: suggesting attribute is not applicable) for all attributes, (2) attribute applicability detection, and (3) fine-grained classification when attributes are determinable. Using DeepFashion-MultiModal, which explicitly defines NA (meaning attribute doesn't exist or is not visible) within attribute label spaces, we benchmark nine VLMs spanning flagship (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro), efficient (GPT-5 Mini, Gemini 2.5 Flash), and ultra-efficient tiers (GPT-5 Nano, Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite) against classifiers trained on pretrained Fashion-CLIP embeddings on 5,000 images across 18 attributes. Our findings reveal that: (1) zero-shot VLMs achieve 64.0% macro-F1, a threefold improvement over logistic regression on pretrained Fashion-CLIP embeddings; (2) VLMs excel at fine-grained classification (Tier 3: 70.8% F1) but struggle with applicability detection (Tier 2: 34.1% NA-F1), identifying a key bottleneck; (3) efficient models achieve over 90% of flagship performance at lower cost, offering practical deployment paths. This diagnostic framework enables practitioners to pinpoint whether errors stem from visibility detection or classification, guiding targeted improvements for production systems.

Abstract: The successful adaptation of foundation models to multi-modal medical imaging is a critical yet unresolved challenge. Existing models often struggle to effectively fuse information from multiple sources and adapt to the heterogeneous nature of pathological tissues. To address this, we introduce a novel framework for adapting foundation models to multi-modal medical imaging, featuring two key technical innovations: sub-region-aware modality attention and adaptive prompt engineering. The attention mechanism enables the model to learn the optimal combination of modalities for each tumor sub-region, while the adaptive prompting strategy leverages the inherent capabilities of foundation models to refine segmentation accuracy. We validate our framework on the BraTS 2020 brain tumor segmentation dataset, demonstrating that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods, particularly in the challenging necrotic core sub-region. Our work provides a principled and effective approach to multi-modal fusion and prompting, paving the way for more accurate and robust foundation model-based solutions in medical imaging.

TL;DR: 提出首个任意分辨率深度图像隐写框架ARDIS，解决现有方法要求秘密图像与载体图像分辨率一致的限制问题，实现了跨分辨率的忠实恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度图像隐写方法要求秘密图像与载体图像分辨率完全一致，导致两大挑战：分辨率不一致时预处理会损失细节，且当分辨率值未知时无法恢复到原始分辨率。需要突破这种离散映射范式。

Method: 1）在隐藏阶段设计频率解耦架构，将秘密图像分解为分辨率对齐的全局基和分辨率无关的高频潜码；2）在恢复阶段提出潜码引导的隐式重建器，通过连续隐函数查询并渲染高频残差；3）为实现盲恢复，引入隐式分辨率编码策略，将离散分辨率转换为密集特征图并隐藏在特征域冗余空间中。

Result: 实验结果表明，ARDIS在不可见性和跨分辨率恢复保真度方面显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: ARDIS通过从离散映射转向参考引导的连续信号重建范式，有效解决了分辨率不匹配问题，实现了任意分辨率的秘密图像恢复，是深度图像隐写领域的重要进展。

Abstract: Deep image steganography (DIS) has achieved significant results in capacity and invisibility. However, current paradigms enforce the secret image to maintain the same resolution as the cover image during hiding and revealing. This leads to two challenges: secret images with inconsistent resolutions must undergo resampling beforehand which results in detail loss during recovery, and the secret image cannot be recovered to its original resolution when the resolution value is unknown. To address these, we propose ARDIS, the first Arbitrary Resolution DIS framework, which shifts the paradigm from discrete mapping to reference-guided continuous signal reconstruction. Specifically, to minimize the detail loss caused by resolution mismatch, we first design a Frequency Decoupling Architecture in hiding stage. It disentangles the secret into a resolution-aligned global basis and a resolution-agnostic high-frequency latent to hide in a fixed-resolution cover. Second, for recovery, we propose a Latent-Guided Implicit Reconstructor to perform deterministic restoration. The recovered detail latent code modulates a continuous implicit function to accurately query and render high-frequency residuals onto the recovered global basis, ensuring faithful restoration of original details. Furthermore, to achieve blind recovery, we introduce an Implicit Resolution Coding strategy. By transforming discrete resolution values into dense feature maps and hiding them in the redundant space of the feature domain, the reconstructor can correctly decode the secret's resolution directly from the steganographic representation. Experimental results demonstrate that ARDIS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both invisibility and cross-resolution recovery fidelity.

Method: 提出ES-mHC框架，使用结构化、定向的超连接矩阵显式建模不同电磁频谱分组（残差流）之间的交互，将特征表示与交互结构解耦。

Result: 学习的超连接矩阵展现出连贯的空间模式和非对称交互行为，为模型内部动态提供了机制性解释；提高扩展率可加速结构化交互模式的出现。

Conclusion: ES-mHC将高光谱图像分类从纯黑盒预测任务转变为结构透明的部分白盒学习过程，提高了模型的可解释性和内部信息流的可视化分析能力。

Abstract: In hyperspectral image classification (HSIC), most deep learning models rely on opaque spectral-spatial feature mixing, limiting their interpretability and hindering understanding of internal decision mechanisms. We present physical spectrum-aware white-box mHC, named ES-mHC, a hyper-connection framework that explicitly models interactions among different electromagnetic spectrum groupings (residual stream in mHC) interactions using structured, directional matrices. By separating feature representation from interaction structure, ES-mHC promotes electromagnetic spectrum grouping specialization, reduces redundancy, and exposes internal information flow that can be directly visualized and spatially analyzed. Using hyperspectral image classification as a representative testbed, we demonstrate that the learned hyper-connection matrices exhibit coherent spatial patterns and asymmetric interaction behaviors, providing mechanistic insight into the model internal dynamics. Furthermore, we find that increasing the expansion rate accelerates the emergence of structured interaction patterns. These results suggest that ES-mHC transforms HSIC from a purely black-box prediction task into a structurally transparent, partially white-box learning process.

TL;DR: FeTal-SAM是一个基于Segment Anything Model的胎儿脑MRI分割方法，通过多图谱配准生成密集提示，实现无需重新训练的灵活分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习分割方法需要大量标注数据且难以适应标签定义变化，同时缺乏对分割机制的可解释性。本研究旨在解决胎儿脑MRI分割中标签定义不灵活、模型需要重新训练以及分割过程缺乏洞察的问题。

Method: 结合图谱引导提示和基础模型原理，利用多图谱配准生成空间对齐标签模板作为密集提示，并配含边界框提示，驱动SAM解码器进行逐结构二元分割，最终融合重建完整3D分割体积。

Result: 在两个数据集上验证，对于高对比度结构（皮质板、小脑）可获得与专用训练的SOTA相当的Dice分数，同时保持对任意解剖结构的分割灵活性。对低对比度结构的准确性略有下降，但整体展现了无需重复训练即可分割的能力。

Conclusion: FeTal-SAM作为通用分割模型具有临床应用潜力，为构建适应性强、无需重新训练的胎儿脑MRI分析工具迈出了有前景的一步。

Abstract: This paper presents FeTal-SAM, a novel adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) tailored for fetal brain MRI segmentation. Traditional deep learning methods often require large annotated datasets for a fixed set of labels, making them inflexible when clinical or research needs change. By integrating atlas-based prompts and foundation-model principles, FeTal-SAM addresses two key limitations in fetal brain MRI segmentation: (1) the need to retrain models for varying label definitions, and (2) the lack of insight into whether segmentations are driven by genuine image contrast or by learned spatial priors. We leverage multi-atlas registration to generate spatially aligned label templates that serve as dense prompts, alongside a bounding-box prompt, for SAM's segmentation decoder. This strategy enables binary segmentation on a per-structure basis, which is subsequently fused to reconstruct the full 3D segmentation volumes. Evaluations on two datasets, the dHCP dataset and an in-house dataset demonstrate FeTal-SAM's robust performance across gestational ages. Notably, it achieves Dice scores comparable to state-of-the-art baselines which were trained for each dataset and label definition for well-contrasted structures like cortical plate and cerebellum, while maintaining the flexibility to segment any user-specified anatomy. Although slightly lower accuracy is observed for subtle, low-contrast structures (e.g., hippocampus, amygdala), our results highlight FeTal-SAM's potential to serve as a general-purpose segmentation model without exhaustive retraining. This method thus constitutes a promising step toward clinically adaptable fetal brain MRI analysis tools.

Conclusion: 首次将2DGS引入低光图像增强，展示了显式高斯表示在保持边缘和抑制伪影方面的优势，实现了无监督的高质量增强

Abstract: Significant progress has been made in low-light image enhancement with respect to visual quality. However, most existing methods primarily operate in the pixel domain or rely on implicit feature representations. As a result, the intrinsic geometric structural priors of images are often neglected. 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) has emerged as a prominent explicit scene representation technique characterized by superior structural fitting capabilities and high rendering efficiency. Despite these advantages, the utilization of 2DGS in low-level vision tasks remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, LL-GaussianMap is proposed as the first unsupervised framework incorporating 2DGS into low-light image enhancement. Distinct from conventional methodologies, the enhancement task is formulated as a gain map generation process guided by 2DGS primitives. The proposed method comprises two primary stages. First, high-fidelity structural reconstruction is executed utilizing 2DGS. Then, data-driven enhancement dictionary coefficients are rendered via the rasterization mechanism of Gaussian splatting through an innovative unified enhancement module. This design effectively incorporates the structural perception capabilities of 2DGS into gain map generation, thereby preserving edges and suppressing artifacts during enhancement. Additionally, the reliance on paired data is circumvented through unsupervised learning. Experimental results demonstrate that LL-GaussianMap achieves superior enhancement performance with an extremely low storage footprint, highlighting the effectiveness of explicit Gaussian representations for image enhancement.

Conclusion: 提出的LL-GaussianImage框架首次实现了2DGS压缩域内低光增强，避免了传统流程的缺陷，为压缩域图像处理开辟了新方向

Abstract: 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) is an emerging explicit scene representation method with significant potential for image compression due to high fidelity and high compression ratios. However, existing low-light enhancement algorithms operate predominantly within the pixel domain. Processing 2DGS-compressed images necessitates a cumbersome decompression-enhancement-recompression pipeline, which compromises efficiency and introduces secondary degradation. To address these limitations, we propose LL-GaussianImage, the first zero-shot unsupervised framework designed for low-light enhancement directly within the 2DGS compressed representation domain. Three primary advantages are offered by this framework. First, a semantic-guided Mixture-of-Experts enhancement framework is designed. Dynamic adaptive transformations are applied to the sparse attribute space of 2DGS using rendered images as guidance to enable compression-as-enhancement without full decompression to a pixel grid. Second, a multi-objective collaborative loss function system is established to strictly constrain smoothness and fidelity during enhancement, suppressing artifacts while improving visual quality. Third, a two-stage optimization process is utilized to achieve reconstruction-as-enhancement. The accuracy of the base representation is ensured through single-scale reconstruction and network robustness is enhanced. High-quality enhancement of low-light images is achieved while high compression ratios are maintained. The feasibility and superiority of the paradigm for direct processing within the compressed representation domain are validated through experimental results.

Abstract: Neuron segmentation in electron microscopy (EM) aims to reconstruct the complete neuronal connectome; however, current deep learning-based methods are limited by their reliance on large-scale training data and extensive, time-consuming manual annotations. Traditional methods augment the training set through geometric and photometric transformations; however, the generated samples remain highly correlated with the original images and lack structural diversity. To address this limitation, we propose a diffusion-based data augmentation framework capable of generating diverse and structurally plausible image-label pairs for neuron segmentation. Specifically, the framework employs a resolution-aware conditional diffusion model with multi-scale conditioning and EM resolution priors to enable voxel-level image synthesis from 3D masks. It further incorporates a biology-guided mask remodeling module that produces augmented masks with enhanced structural realism. Together, these components effectively enrich the training set and improve segmentation performance. On the AC3 and AC4 datasets under low-annotation regimes, our method improves the ARAND metric by 32.1% and 30.7%, respectively, when combined with two different post-processing methods.

Abstract: Spatial reasoning in vision language models (VLMs) remains fragile when semantics hinge on subtle temporal or geometric cues. We introduce a synthetic benchmark that probes two complementary skills: situational awareness (recognizing whether an interaction is harmful or benign) and spatial awareness (tracking who does what to whom, and reasoning about relative positions and motion). Through minimal video pairs, we test three challenges: distinguishing violence from benign activity, binding assailant roles across viewpoints, and judging fine-grained trajectory alignment. While we evaluate recent VLMs in a training-free setting, the benchmark is applicable to any video classification model. Results show performance only slightly above chance across tasks. A simple aid, stable color cues, partly reduces assailant role confusions but does not resolve the underlying weakness. By releasing data and code, we aim to provide reproducible diagnostics and seed exploration of lightweight spatial priors to complement large-scale pretraining.

Abstract: A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a deep learning algorithm that has been specifically designed for computer vision applications. The CNNs proved successful in handling the increasing amount of data in many computer vision problems, where classical machine learning algorithms were insufficient. Flowers have many uses in our daily lives, from decorating to making medicines to detoxifying the environment. Identifying flower types requires expert knowledge. However, accessing experts at any time and in any location may not always be feasible. In this study a mobile application based on CNNs was developed to recognize different types of flowers to provide non-specialists with quick and easy access to information about flower types. The study employed three distinct CNN models, namely MobileNet, DenseNet121, and Xception, to determine the most suitable model for the mobile application. The classification performances of the models were evaluated by training them with seven different optimization algorithms. The DenseNet-121 architecture, which uses the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization algorithm, was the most successful, achieving 95.84 % accuracy, 96.00% precision, recall, and F1-score. This result shows that CNNs can be used for flower classification in mobile applications.

Abstract: We introduce a lightweight experimentation pipeline designed to lower the barrier for applying machine learning (ML) methods for classifying images in ecological research. We enable ecologists to experiment with ML models independently, thus they can move beyond off-the-shelf models and generate insights tailored to local datasets and specific classification tasks and target variables. Our tool combines a simple command-line interface for preprocessing, training, and evaluation with a graphical interface for annotation, error analysis, and model comparison. This design enables ecologists to build and iterate on compact, task-specific classifiers without requiring advanced ML expertise. As a proof of concept, we apply the pipeline to classify red deer (Cervus elaphus) by age and sex from 3392 camera trap images collected in the Veldenstein Forest, Germany. Using 4352 cropped images containing individual deer labeled by experts, we trained and evaluated multiple backbone architectures with a wide variety of parameters and data augmentation strategies. Our best-performing models achieved 90.77% accuracy for age classification and 96.15% for sex classification. These results demonstrate that reliable demographic classification is feasible even with limited data to answer narrow, well-defined ecological problems. More broadly, the framework provides ecologists with an accessible tool for developing ML models tailored to specific research questions, paving the way for broader adoption of ML in wildlife monitoring and demographic analysis.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the remarkable success of deep learning in remote sensing image interpretation, driven by the availability of large-scale benchmark datasets. However, this reliance on massive training data also brings two major challenges: (1) high storage and computational costs, and (2) the risk of data leakage, especially when sensitive categories are involved. To address these challenges, this study introduces the concept of dataset distillation into the field of remote sensing image interpretation for the first time. Specifically, we train a text-to-image diffusion model to condense a large-scale remote sensing dataset into a compact and representative distilled dataset. To improve the discriminative quality of the synthesized samples, we propose a classifier-driven guidance by injecting a classification consistency loss from a pre-trained model into the diffusion training process. Besides, considering the rich semantic complexity of remote sensing imagery, we further perform latent space clustering on training samples to select representative and diverse prototypes as visual style guidance, while using a visual language model to provide aggregated text descriptions. Experiments on three high-resolution remote sensing scene classification benchmarks show that the proposed method can distill realistic and diverse samples for downstream model training. Code and pre-trained models are available online (https://github.com/YonghaoXu/DPD).

Abstract: The increasing global demand for sustainable agriculture necessitates intelligent monitoring systems that optimize resource utilization and plant health management. Traditional farming methods rely on manual observation and periodic watering, often leading to water wastage, inconsistent plant growth, and delayed response to environmental changes. This paper presents a comprehensive IoT-based smart plant monitoring system that integrates multiple environmental sensors with automated irrigation and cloud analytics. The proposed system utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller to collect real-time data from DHT22 (temperature/humidity), HC-SR04 (water level), and soil moisture sensors, with visual feedback through an OLED display and auditory alerts via a buzzer.

Abstract: With the growing demand for device-free and privacy-preserving sensing solutions, Wi-Fi sensing has emerged as a promising approach for human pose estimation (HPE). However, existing methods often process vast amounts of channel state information (CSI) data directly, ultimately straining networking resources. This paper introduces TinySense, an efficient compression framework that enhances the scalability of Wi-Fi-based human sensing. Our approach is based on a new vector quantization-based generative adversarial network (VQGAN). Specifically, by leveraging a VQGAN-learned codebook, TinySense significantly reduces CSI data while maintaining the accuracy required for reliable HPE. To optimize compression, we employ the K-means algorithm to dynamically adjust compression bitrates to cluster a large-scale pre-trained codebook into smaller subsets. Furthermore, a Transformer model is incorporated to mitigate bitrate loss, enhancing robustness in unreliable networking conditions. We prototype TinySense on an experimental testbed using Jetson Nano and Raspberry Pi to measure latency and network resource use. Extensive results demonstrate that TinySense significantly outperforms state-of-the-art compression schemes, achieving up to 1.5x higher HPE accuracy score (PCK20) under the same compression rate. It also reduces latency and networking overhead, respectively, by up to 5x and 2.5x. The code repository is available online at here.

Abstract: Background: Coronary angiography (CAG) is a cornerstone imaging modality for assessing coronary artery disease and guiding interventional treatment decisions. However, in real-world clinical settings, angiographic images are often characterized by complex lesion morphology, severe class imbalance, label uncertainty, and limited computational resources, posing substantial challenges to conventional deep learning approaches in terms of robustness and generalization.Methods: The proposed framework is built upon a pretrained convolutional neural network to construct a lightweight hybrid neural representation.

Furthermore, a brain-inspired attention-modulated loss function, combining Focal Loss with label smoothing, is employed to enhance sensitivity to hard samples and uncertain annotations. Class-imbalance-aware sampling and cosine annealing with warm restarts are adopted to mimic rhythmic regulation and attention allocation mechanisms observed in biological neural systems.Results: Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight brain-inspired model achieves strong and stable performance in binary coronary angiography classification, yielding competitive accuracy, recall, F1-score, and AUC metrics while maintaining high computational efficiency.Conclusion: This study validates the effectiveness of brain-inspired learning mechanisms in lightweight medical image analysis and provides a biologically plausible and deployable solution for intelligent clinical decision support under limited computational resources.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to securing machine learning model deployments against potential distribution shifts in practical applications, the Total Variation Out-of-Distribution (TV-OOD) detection method. Existing methods have produced satisfactory results, but TV-OOD improves upon these by leveraging the Total Variation Network Estimator to calculate each input's contribution to the overall total variation. By defining this as the total variation score, TV-OOD discriminates between in- and out-of-distribution data. The method's efficacy was tested across a range of models and datasets, consistently yielding results in image classification tasks that were either comparable or superior to those achieved by leading-edge out-of-distribution detection techniques across all evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Contrast medium plays a pivotal role in radiological imaging, as it amplifies lesion conspicuity and improves detection for the diagnosis of tumor-related diseases. However, depending on the patient's health condition or the medical resources available, the use of contrast medium is not always feasible. Recent work has explored AI-based image translation to synthesize contrast-enhanced images directly from non-contrast scans, aims to reduce side effects and streamlines clinical workflows. Progress in this direction has been constrained by data limitations: (1) existing public datasets focus almost exclusively on brain-related paired MR modalities; (2) other collections include partially paired data but suffer from missing modalities/timestamps and imperfect spatial alignment; (3) explicit labeling of CT vs. CTC or DCE phases is often absent; (4) substantial resources remain private. To bridge this gap, we introduce the first public, fully paired, pan-cancer medical imaging dataset spanning 11 human organs. The MR data include complete dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) sequences covering all three phases (DCE1-DCE3), while the CT data provide paired non-contrast and contrast-enhanced acquisitions (CTC). The dataset is curated for anatomical correspondence, enabling rigorous evaluation of 1-to-1, N-to-1, and N-to-N translation settings (e.g., predicting DCE phases from non-contrast inputs). Built upon this resource, we establish a comprehensive benchmark. We report results from representative baselines of contemporary image-to-image translation. We release the dataset and benchmark to catalyze research on safe, effective contrast synthesis, with direct relevance to multi-organ oncology imaging workflows. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/YifanChen02/PMPBench.

TL;DR: 研究了视觉基础模型（VFM）预训练目标与下游任务对齐对性能的影响，通过前列腺多参数MR影像的五项任务测试发现，预训练与下游任务越对齐，性能提升越大且收敛越快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉基础模型虽然在预训练上投入巨大计算资源，但下游任务改进却不均衡，推测这是由于预训练目标与下游视觉成像任务（如分割、分类、图像合成）需求不匹配导致的。

Method: 在前列腺多参数MR影像这一具体临床领域，评估了两种VFM模型的重建型MAE模型（ProFound）和对比较学习模型（ProViCNet），通过简单最大均值差异（MMD）等指标衡量预训练与下游任务的差异程度。

Result: 预训练与下游任务对齐度越好（以微调前后相同特征的MMD度量），性能提升越大、收敛越快。

Conclusion: 设计预训练目标时应考虑下游任务的适用性，任务对齐是关键。

Abstract: Foundation models leverage large-scale pretraining to capture extensive knowledge, demonstrating generalization in a wide range of language tasks. By comparison, vision foundation models (VFMs) often exhibit uneven improvements across downstream tasks, despite substantial computational investment. We postulate that this limitation arises from a mismatch between pretraining objectives and the demands of downstream vision-and-imaging tasks. Pretraining strategies like masked image reconstruction or contrastive learning shape representations for tasks such as recovery of generic visual patterns or global semantic structures, which may not align with the task-specific requirements of downstream applications including segmentation, classification, or image synthesis. To investigate this in a concrete real-world clinical area, we assess two VFMs, a reconstruction-focused MAE-based model (ProFound) and a contrastive-learning-based model (ProViCNet), on five prostate multiparametric MR imaging tasks, examining how such task alignment influences transfer performance, i.e., from pretraining to fine-tuning. Our findings indicate that better alignment between pretraining and downstream tasks, measured by simple divergence metrics such as maximum-mean-discrepancy (MMD) between the same features before and after fine-tuning, correlates with greater performance improvements and faster convergence, emphasizing the importance of designing and analyzing pretraining objectives with downstream applicability in mind.

Conclusion: RadJEPA展示了不依赖语言监督的自监督学习在放射学图像分析中的有效性，为数据稀缺场景提供了有前景的解决方案

Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision language models guide the learning of visual representations; however, this form of supervision is constrained by the availability of paired image text data, raising the question of whether robust radiology encoders can be learned without relying on language supervision. In this work, we introduce RadJEPA, a self-supervised framework built on a Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture that learns without language supervision. Pre-trained solely on unlabeled chest X-ray images, the model learns to predict latent representations of masked image regions. This predictive objective differs fundamentally from both image text pre-training and DINO-style self-distillation: rather than aligning global representations across views or modalities, RadJEPA explicitly models latent-space prediction. We evaluate the learned encoder on disease classification, semantic segmentation, and report generation tasks. Across benchmarks, RadJEPA achieves performance exceeding state-of-the-art approaches, including Rad-DINO.

Abstract: Understanding where and how emotions are represented in large-scale foundation models remains an open problem, particularly in multimodal affective settings. Despite the strong empirical performance of recent affective models, the internal architectural mechanisms that support affective understanding and generation are still poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic mechanistic study of affective modeling in multimodal foundation models. Across multiple architectures, training strategies, and affective tasks, we analyze how emotion-oriented supervision reshapes internal model parameters. Our results consistently reveal a clear and robust pattern: affective adaptation does not primarily focus on the attention module, but instead localizes to the feed-forward gating projection (\texttt{gate\_proj}). Through controlled module transfer, targeted single-module adaptation, and destructive ablation, we further demonstrate that \texttt{gate\_proj} is sufficient, efficient, and necessary for affective understanding and generation. Notably, by tuning only approximately 24.5\% of the parameters tuned by AffectGPT, our approach achieves 96.6\% of its average performance across eight affective tasks, highlighting substantial parameter efficiency. Together, these findings provide empirical evidence that affective capabilities in foundation models are structurally mediated by feed-forward gating mechanisms and identify \texttt{gate\_proj} as a central architectural locus of affective modeling.

Abstract: In the realm of Virtual Reality (VR) and Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), real-time emotion recognition shows promise for supporting individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in improving social skills. This task requires a strict latency-accuracy trade-off, with motion-to-photon (MTP) latency kept below 140 ms to maintain contingency. However, most off-the-shelf Deep Learning models prioritize accuracy over the strict timing constraints of commodity hardware. As a first step toward accessible VR therapy, we benchmark State-of-the-Art (SOTA) models for Zero-Shot Facial Expression Recognition (FER) on virtual characters using the UIBVFED dataset. We evaluate Medium and Nano variants of YOLO (v8, v11, and v12) for face detection, alongside general-purpose Vision Transformers including CLIP, SigLIP, and ViT-FER.Our results on CPU-only inference demonstrate that while face detection on stylized avatars is robust (100% accuracy), a "Latency Wall" exists in the classification stage. The YOLOv11n architecture offers the optimal balance for detection (~54 ms). However, general-purpose Transformers like CLIP and SigLIP fail to achieve viable accuracy (<23%) or speed (>150 ms) for real-time loops. This study highlights the necessity for lightweight, domain-specific architectures to enable accessible, real-time AI in therapeutic settings.

Motivation: 手术环境中的3D手部姿态估计对技能评估、机器人辅助干预和流程分析至关重要，但面临强烈光照、频繁遮挡、统一手套外观以及标注数据稀缺等挑战。

Method: 采用无需领域微调的多视图管道，整合现成预训练模型进行人体检测、全身姿态估计和2D手部关键点预测，通过约束优化获得3D姿态，并构建包含6.8万帧标注数据的手术数据集。

Result: 定量实验显示，该方法相比基线在2D平均关节误差降低31%，3D平均关节位置误差降低76%。

Conclusion: 研究为手术计算机视觉中的3D手部姿态估计建立了强基线，提供了无需训练的管道和标注数据集，促进该领域未来发展。

Abstract: Purpose: Accurate 3D hand pose estimation supports surgical applications such as skill assessment, robot-assisted interventions, and geometry-aware workflow analysis. However, surgical environments pose severe challenges, including intense and localized lighting, frequent occlusions by instruments or staff, and uniform hand appearance due to gloves, combined with a scarcity of annotated datasets for reliable model training.
  Method: We propose a robust multi-view pipeline for 3D hand pose estimation in surgical contexts that requires no domain-specific fine-tuning and relies solely on off-the-shelf pretrained models. The pipeline integrates reliable person detection, whole-body pose estimation, and state-of-the-art 2D hand keypoint prediction on tracked hand crops, followed by a constrained 3D optimization. In addition, we introduce a novel surgical benchmark dataset comprising over 68,000 frames and 3,000 manually annotated 2D hand poses with triangulated 3D ground truth, recorded in a replica operating room under varying levels of scene complexity.
  Results: Quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines, achieving a 31% reduction in 2D mean joint error and a 76% reduction in 3D mean per-joint position error.
  Conclusion: Our work establishes a strong baseline for 3D hand pose estimation in surgery, providing both a training-free pipeline and a comprehensive annotated dataset to facilitate future research in surgical computer vision.

Abstract: Deep neural network models degrade significantly in the long-tailed data distribution, with the overall training data dominated by a small set of classes in the head, and the tail classes obtaining less training examples. Addressing the imbalance in the classes, attention in the related literature was given mainly to the adjustments carried out in the decision space in terms of either corrections performed at the logit level in order to compensate class-prior bias, with the least attention to the optimization process resulting from the adjustments introduced through the differences in the confidences among the samples. In the current study, we present the design of a class and confidence-aware re-weighting scheme for long-tailed learning. This scheme is purely based upon the loss level and has a complementary nature to the existing methods performing the adjustment of the logits. In the practical implementation stage of the proposed scheme, we use an Ω(p_t, f_c) function. This function enables the modulation of the contribution towards the training task based upon the confidence value of the prediction, as well as the relative frequency of the corresponding class. Our observations in the experiments are corroborated by significant experimental results performed on the CIFAR-100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018 datasets under various values of imbalance factors that clearly authenticate the theoretical discussions above.

Motivation: 神经分割对于构建神经连接组、解析大脑功能组织至关重要，但由于神经元形态不规则且结构密集交织，该任务具有挑战性。现有CNN和Transformer方法分别受到局部依赖或体素细节损失限制，需要一种新的方法以同时有效捕获长距离依赖并保留微细节。

Conclusion: NeuroMamba通过多视角建模和Mamba低计算复杂度的结合，同时解决了长距离依赖和细节保留的挑战，极大提升了神经元分割质量，有望促进神经科学和连接组学的发展。

Abstract: Neuron segmentation is the cornerstone of reconstructing comprehensive neuronal connectomes, which is essential for deciphering the functional organization of the brain. The irregular morphology and densely intertwined structures of neurons make this task particularly challenging. Prevailing CNN-based methods often fail to resolve ambiguous boundaries due to the lack of long-range context, whereas Transformer-based methods suffer from boundary imprecision caused by the loss of voxel-level details during patch partitioning. To address these limitations, we propose NeuroMamba, a multi-perspective framework that exploits the linear complexity of Mamba to enable patch-free global modeling and synergizes this with complementary local feature modeling, thereby efficiently capturing long-range dependencies while meticulously preserving fine-grained voxel details. Specifically, we design a channel-gated Boundary Discriminative Feature Extractor (BDFE) to enhance local morphological cues. Complementing this, we introduce the Spatial Continuous Feature Extractor (SCFE), which integrates a resolution-aware scanning mechanism into the Visual Mamba architecture to adaptively model global dependencies across varying data resolutions. Finally, a cross-modulation mechanism synergistically fuses these multi-perspective features. Our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across four public EM datasets, validating its exceptional adaptability to both anisotropic and isotropic resolutions. The source code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: 论文提出了EvolSplat4D框架，在静态和动态城市场景的新视角合成任务中实现了更高质量的4D重建，其性能优于当前的每场景优化和前馈方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 静态与动态城市场景的神经视角合成对自动驾驶仿真很重要，但已有方法往往难以兼顾计算效率与重建质量。基于神经辐射场或3D高斯溅射的方法虽然重建质量高，但每次场景都需耗时优化；而前馈方法多采用逐像素高斯表示，在复杂动态环境中容易导致三维不一致。因此需要一种能平衡时间与质量的通用性方案。

Method: 提出EvolSplat4D，为一种前馈式框架，通过三个专门分支统一体素基和像素基高斯预测。1) 对于近距静态区域，从3D特征体直接预测多帧一致的3D高斯几何，并辅以语义增强的图像渲染模块预测外观。2) 对于动态物体，采用物体中心化正则空间与运动调整渲染模块聚合时序特征，确保噪声运动先验下的稳定4D重建。3) 对于远景，设计高效逐像素高斯分支以保证全场景覆盖。

Result: 在KITTI-360、KITTI、Waymo、PandaSet数据集上进行了实验评估，结果表明EvolSplat4D能在静态和动态场景中实现更优的准确度与一致性，表现超越每场景优化方法和当前最佳的前馈基线方法。

Conclusion: EvolSplat4D是一种新颖的多分支前馈式框架，能统一体素基与像素基高斯预测，在静态及动态城市场景的新型视角合成任务中，既保持了高质量重建又避免对每场景优化的依赖，其有效性得到了实验验证。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis (NVS) of static and dynamic urban scenes is essential for autonomous driving simulation, yet existing methods often struggle to balance reconstruction time with quality. While state-of-the-art neural radiance fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting approaches achieve photorealism, they often rely on time-consuming per-scene optimization. Conversely, emerging feed-forward methods frequently adopt per-pixel Gaussian representations, which lead to 3D inconsistencies when aggregating multi-view predictions in complex, dynamic environments. We propose EvolSplat4D, a feed-forward framework that moves beyond existing per-pixel paradigms by unifying volume-based and pixel-based Gaussian prediction across three specialized branches. For close-range static regions, we predict consistent geometry of 3D Gaussians over multiple frames directly from a 3D feature volume, complemented by a semantically-enhanced image-based rendering module for predicting their appearance. For dynamic actors, we utilize object-centric canonical spaces and a motion-adjusted rendering module to aggregate temporal features, ensuring stable 4D reconstruction despite noisy motion priors. Far-Field scenery is handled by an efficient per-pixel Gaussian branch to ensure full-scene coverage. Experimental results on the KITTI-360, KITTI, Waymo, and PandaSet datasets show that EvolSplat4D reconstructs both static and dynamic environments with superior accuracy and consistency, outperforming both per-scene optimization and state-of-the-art feed-forward baselines.

Abstract: Modern foundational Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and video world models have advanced significantly in mathematical, common-sense, and visual reasoning, but their grasp of the underlying physics remains underexplored. Existing benchmarks attempting to measure this matter rely on synthetic, Visual Question Answer templates or focus on perceptual video quality that is tangential to measuring how well the video abides by physical laws. To address this fragmentation, we introduce PhysicsMind, a unified benchmark with both real and simulation environments that evaluates law-consistent reasoning and generation over three canonical principles: Center of Mass, Lever Equilibrium, and Newton's First Law. PhysicsMind comprises two main tasks: i) VQA tasks, testing whether models can reason and determine physical quantities and values from images or short videos, and ii) Video Generation(VG) tasks, evaluating if predicted motion trajectories obey the same center-of-mass, torque, and inertial constraints as the ground truth. A broad range of recent models and video generation models is evaluated on PhysicsMind and found to rely on appearance heuristics while often violating basic mechanics. These gaps indicate that current scaling and training are still insufficient for robust physical understanding, underscoring PhysicsMind as a focused testbed for physics-aware multimodal models. Our data will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: The emergence of visual foundation models has revolutionized visual odometry~(VO) and SLAM, enabling pose estimation and dense reconstruction within a single feed-forward network. However, unlike traditional pipelines that leverage keyframe methods to enhance efficiency and accuracy, current foundation model based methods, such as VGGT-Long, typically process raw image sequences indiscriminately. This leads to computational redundancy and degraded performance caused by low inter-frame parallax, which provides limited contextual stereo information. Integrating traditional geometric heuristics into these methods is non-trivial, as their performance depends on high-dimensional latent representations rather than explicit geometric metrics. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel keyframe-based feed-forward VO. Instead of relying on hand-crafted rules, our approach employs reinforcement learning to derive an adaptive keyframe policy in a data-driven manner, aligning selection with the intrinsic characteristics of the underlying foundation model. We train our agent on TartanAir dataset and conduct extensive evaluations across several real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistent and substantial improvements over state-of-the-art feed-forward VO methods.

Abstract: Virtual immunohistochemistry (IHC) aims to computationally synthesize molecular staining patterns from routine Hematoxylin and Eosin (H\&E) images, offering a cost-effective and tissue-efficient alternative to traditional physical staining. However, this task is particularly challenging: H\&E morphology provides ambiguous cues about protein expression, and similar tissue structures may correspond to distinct molecular states. Most existing methods focus on direct appearance synthesis to implicitly achieve cross-modal generation, often resulting in semantic inconsistencies due to insufficient structural priors. In this paper, we propose Pathology-Aware Integrated Next-Scale Transformation (PAINT), a visual autoregressive framework that reformulates the synthesis process as a structure-first conditional generation task. Unlike direct image translation, PAINT enforces a causal order by resolving molecular details conditioned on a global structural layout. Central to this approach is the introduction of a Spatial Structural Start Map (3S-Map), which grounds the autoregressive initialization in observed morphology, ensuring deterministic, spatially aligned synthesis. Experiments on the IHC4BC and MIST datasets demonstrate that PAINT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in structural fidelity and clinical downstream tasks, validating the potential of structure-guided autoregressive modeling.

TL;DR: 基于扩散模型的医学图像分割，支持文本描述和多模态迁移


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统医学影像分割方法无法响应自然语言提示，而且不能生成多个候选分割结果，限制了人机交互和跨模态适应性。扩散模型虽有潜力，但从头训练成本高且功能局限。

Method: 提出ProGiDiff通过ControlNet风格的条件控制机制，利用预训练扩散模型生成分割掩码，能够根据文本提示进行多类别分割，并可通过少量样本低秩适应实现跨模态迁移。

Result: CT图像器官分割实验显示优于现有方法，特别是在专家参与的多候选分割中表现突出，而且学习到的条件机制能高效迁移到MRI分割。

Conclusion: ProGiDiff成功打通了自然语言提示与医学图像分割的桥梁，实现了灵活的器官分割和跨模态适应，为基于扩散模型的医学图像分析提供了新思路。

Abstract: Widely adopted medical image segmentation methods, although efficient, are primarily deterministic and remain poorly amenable to natural language prompts. Thus, they lack the capability to estimate multiple proposals, human interaction, and cross-modality adaptation. Recently, text-to-image diffusion models have shown potential to bridge the gap. However, training them from scratch requires a large dataset-a limitation for medical image segmentation. Furthermore, they are often limited to binary segmentation and cannot be conditioned on a natural language prompt. To this end, we propose a novel framework called ProGiDiff that leverages existing image generation models for medical image segmentation purposes. Specifically, we propose a ControlNet-style conditioning mechanism with a custom encoder, suitable for image conditioning, to steer a pre-trained diffusion model to output segmentation masks. It naturally extends to a multi-class setting simply by prompting the target organ. Our experiment on organ segmentation from CT images demonstrates strong performance compared to previous methods and could greatly benefit from an expert-in-the-loop setting to leverage multiple proposals. Importantly, we demonstrate that the learned conditioning mechanism can be easily transferred through low-rank, few-shot adaptation to segment MR images.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个名为Distracting Token Pruning（DTP）的即插即用框架，用于动态检测和修剪视觉-语言动作模型中与任务无关的图像标记，以纠正模型的视觉注意力模式，从而提高任务成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉-语言动作模型在处理机器人操作任务时，可能会过度关注任务无关区域的图像标记（即分心标记），这会干扰模型生成期望的动作标记，从而影响任务成功率。

Method: 引入一个简单而有效的即插即用Distracting Token Pruning框架，该框架能够动态检测和修剪这些分心的图像标记，而不改变原始模型架构或增加额外输入。

Conclusion: 分心标记修剪方法有效纠正了视觉-语言动作模型的注意力模式，提高了任务成功率，并揭示了视觉-语言动作模型中的一个普遍现象，为未来研究提供了指导。

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable progress in robotic manipulation by leveraging the powerful perception abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to understand environments and directly output actions. However, by default, VLA models may overly attend to image tokens in the task-irrelevant region, which we describe as 'distracting tokens'. This behavior can disturb the model from the generation of the desired action tokens in each step, affecting the success rate of tasks. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet effective plug-and-play Distracting Token Pruning (DTP) framework, which dynamically detects and prunes these distracting image tokens. By correcting the model's visual attention patterns, we aim to improve the task success rate, as well as exploring the performance upper boundaries of the model without altering its original architecture or adding additional inputs. Experiments on the SIMPLER Benchmark (Li et al., 2024) show that our method consistently achieving relative improvements in task success rates across different types of novel VLA models, demonstrating generalizability to transformer-based VLAs. Further analysis reveals a negative correlation between the task success rate and the amount of attentions in the task-irrelevant region for all models tested, highlighting a common phenomenon of VLA models that could guide future research.

Motivation: 尽管基础模型在多种视觉任务上表现出强大的泛化能力，但其在联邦学习环境中的部署受到高计算需求、大量通信开销和高推理成本的限制。

Method: 开发了双尺度联邦框架（DSFedMed），实现了中央基础模型和轻量级客户端模型之间的互知识蒸馏。采用生成的高质量医学图像替代真实公共数据集，并提出可学习性引导的样本选择策略，以提高双尺度蒸馏的效率和效果。

Result: 在五个医学图像分割数据集上的评估表明，与现有联邦基础模型基线相比，DSFedMed实现了Dice分数平均提升2%，同时使通信成本和推理时间减少了近90%。

Conclusion: DSFedMed在资源有限的联邦部署中实现了显著的效率提升和可扩展性，验证了该框架在降低通信和计算开销的同时提升分割性能的有效性。

Abstract: Foundation Models (FMs) have demonstrated strong generalization across diverse vision tasks. However, their deployment in federated settings is hindered by high computational demands, substantial communication overhead, and significant inference costs. We propose DSFedMed, a dual-scale federated framework that enables mutual knowledge distillation between a centralized foundation model and lightweight client models for medical image segmentation. To support knowledge distillation, a set of high-quality medical images is generated to replace real public datasets, and a learnability-guided sample selection strategy is proposed to enhance efficiency and effectiveness in dual-scale distillation. This mutual distillation enables the foundation model to transfer general knowledge to lightweight clients, while also incorporating client-specific insights to refine the foundation model. Evaluations on five medical imaging segmentation datasets show that DSFedMed achieves an average 2 percent improvement in Dice score while reducing communication costs and inference time by nearly 90 percent compared to existing federated foundation model baselines. These results demonstrate significant efficiency gains and scalability for resource-limited federated deployments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了MoRo框架，通过掩码建模从单目视频中重建被遮挡的人体动作，结合多种数据集训练的多模态先验知识，实现实时、鲁棒的动作恢复


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单目视频人体动作重建方法在面对现实世界频繁遮挡时存在局限性：回归方法对缺失观测脆弱；优化和扩散方法虽更鲁棒但推理速度慢且预处理复杂。需要一种既能处理遮挡又能高效推理的解决方案

Method: MoRo采用生成式掩码建模框架，将动作重建视为视频条件任务。设计了跨模态学习方案，集成三个先验：（1）基于MoCap数据集训练的运动轨迹先验；（2）基于图像-姿态数据集训练的帧级姿态先验；（3）基于视频-动作数据微调的掩码Transformer，融合视觉线索与运动动态。框架在全局坐标系中一致地恢复动作

Result: 在EgoBody和RICH数据集上的大量实验表明，MoRo在遮挡情况下显著优于现有最先进方法，在准确性、动作真实感方面表现突出，在非遮挡场景中性能相当。在单个H200 GPU上达到70 FPS的实时推理速度

Conclusion: MoRo是一个遮挡鲁棒的端到端生成框架，通过掩码建模有效处理遮挡，同时保持高效推理。结合多模态先验知识和跨数据集学习策略，在现实世界遮挡场景中实现了高质量的人体动作重建，平衡了准确性和实时性需求

Abstract: Human motion reconstruction from monocular videos is a fundamental challenge in computer vision, with broad applications in AR/VR, robotics, and digital content creation, but remains challenging under frequent occlusions in real-world settings.Existing regression-based methods are efficient but fragile to missing observations, while optimization- and diffusion-based approaches improve robustness at the cost of slow inference speed and heavy preprocessing steps. To address these limitations, we leverage recent advances in generative masked modeling and present MoRo: Masked Modeling for human motion Recovery under Occlusions. MoRo is an occlusion-robust, end-to-end generative framework that formulates motion reconstruction as a video-conditioned task, and efficiently recover human motion in a consistent global coordinate system from RGB videos. By masked modeling, MoRo naturally handles occlusions while enabling efficient, end-to-end inference. To overcome the scarcity of paired video-motion data, we design a cross-modality learning scheme that learns multi-modal priors from a set of heterogeneous datasets: (i) a trajectory-aware motion prior trained on MoCap datasets, (ii) an image-conditioned pose prior trained on image-pose datasets, capturing diverse per-frame poses, and (iii) a video-conditioned masked transformer that fuses motion and pose priors, finetuned on video-motion datasets to integrate visual cues with motion dynamics for robust inference. Extensive experiments on EgoBody and RICH demonstrate that MoRo substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and motion realism under occlusions, while performing on-par in non-occluded scenarios. MoRo achieves real-time inference at 70 FPS on a single H200 GPU.

Abstract: Pixel-wise capabilities are essential for building interactive intelligent systems. However, pixel-wise multi-modal LLMs (MLLMs) remain difficult to scale due to complex region-level encoders, specialized segmentation decoders, and incompatible training objectives. To address these challenges, we present SAMTok, a discrete mask tokenizer that converts any region mask into two special tokens and reconstructs the mask using these tokens with high fidelity. By treating masks as new language tokens, SAMTok enables base MLLMs (such as the QwenVL series) to learn pixel-wise capabilities through standard next-token prediction and simple reinforcement learning, without architectural modifications and specialized loss design. SAMTok builds on SAM2 and is trained on 209M diverse masks using a mask encoder and residual vector quantizer to produce discrete, compact, and information-rich tokens. With 5M SAMTok-formatted mask understanding and generation data samples, QwenVL-SAMTok attains state-of-the-art or comparable results on region captioning, region VQA, grounded conversation, referring segmentation, scene graph parsing, and multi-round interactive segmentation. We further introduce a textual answer-matching reward that enables efficient reinforcement learning for mask generation, delivering substantial improvements on GRES and GCG benchmarks. Our results demonstrate a scalable and straightforward paradigm for equipping MLLMs with strong pixel-wise capabilities. Our code and models are available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CIR基准数据集通常查询类别有限，无法捕捉真实场景的多样性需求。为了填补这一评估空白，需要构建一个更全面、细粒度的基准来评估模型在多类别场景下的性能。

Method: 利用图像编辑技术实现对修改类型和内容的精确控制，构建了一个合成多类别查询的流水线，并以此创建了EDIR基准数据集，包含5000个高质量查询，涵盖5个主类别和15个子类别。

Result: 对13个多模态嵌入模型的全面评估显示存在显著能力差距，即使是顶级模型（如RzenEmbed和GME）在所有子类别上也无法保持稳定性能。通过对比分析揭示了现有基准的内在局限性，如模态偏见和类别覆盖不足。

Conclusion: EDIR基准数据集为CIR任务提供了更严格的评估标准，实验表明某些类别可以通过针对性数据训练解决，而另一些类别则暴露了当前模型架构的内在限制，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) is a pivotal and complex task in multimodal understanding. Current CIR benchmarks typically feature limited query categories and fail to capture the diverse requirements of real-world scenarios. To bridge this evaluation gap, we leverage image editing to achieve precise control over modification types and content, enabling a pipeline for synthesizing queries across a broad spectrum of categories. Using this pipeline, we construct EDIR, a novel fine-grained CIR benchmark. EDIR encompasses 5,000 high-quality queries structured across five main categories and fifteen subcategories. Our comprehensive evaluation of 13 multimodal embedding models reveals a significant capability gap; even state-of-the-art models (e.g., RzenEmbed and GME) struggle to perform consistently across all subcategories, highlighting the rigorous nature of our benchmark. Through comparative analysis, we further uncover inherent limitations in existing benchmarks, such as modality biases and insufficient categorical coverage. Furthermore, an in-domain training experiment demonstrates the feasibility of our benchmark. This experiment clarifies the task challenges by distinguishing between categories that are solvable with targeted data and those that expose intrinsic limitations of current model architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像生成水印多在后处理阶段在像素空间进行，会带来计算开销与视觉伪影。探索潜在空间水印以减少开销、提升效率与不可察觉性，并实现跨生成模型统一的潜在水印框架。

Method: 在生成模型的潜在空间中训练后处理水印模型（latent watermarkers），再将水印信息蒸馏到生成模型本身或潜在解码器中，实现in-model latent watermarking，提升速度与鲁棒性。

Result: 潜在水印在保持不可察觉性相当的情况下达到了竞争性的鲁棒性，相比像素空间基线实现高达20倍加速。实验亦表明蒸馏潜在水印比蒸馏像素空间水印效果更好，即更高效且更鲁棒。

Conclusion: DistSeal展示了潜在空间水印在扩散与自回归模型上的有效性，提出一种既高效又鲁棒的解决方案，并证明蒸馏潜在水印优于蒸馏像素空间水印。

Abstract: Existing approaches for watermarking AI-generated images often rely on post-hoc methods applied in pixel space, introducing computational overhead and potential visual artifacts. In this work, we explore latent space watermarking and introduce DistSeal, a unified approach for latent watermarking that works across both diffusion and autoregressive models. Our approach works by training post-hoc watermarking models in the latent space of generative models. We demonstrate that these latent watermarkers can be effectively distilled either into the generative model itself or into the latent decoder, enabling in-model watermarking. The resulting latent watermarks achieve competitive robustness while offering similar imperceptibility and up to 20x speedup compared to pixel-space baselines. Our experiments further reveal that distilling latent watermarkers outperforms distilling pixel-space ones, providing a solution that is both more efficient and more robust.

Motivation: 当前大多数先进的动画3D对象生成方法难以实际应用，存在设置受限、运行时长久或质量有限等问题。需要一种能快速生成可用于生产的动画3D网格的方法。

Method: 提出基于“时序3D扩散”框架的ActionMesh模型：1）调整现有3D扩散模型，在时序维度上生成一组同步的潜变量，表示随时间变化的独立3D形状；2）设计时序3D自编码器，将独立形状序列转换为预定义参考形状的对应变形，从而构建动画。

Result: 在标准视频转4D基准测试（Consistent4D、Objaverse）上，实现了最先进的几何精度和时间一致性性能，能以前所未有的速度和质量生成动画3D网格。

Conclusion: ActionMesh能够从多样化输入快速生成具有拓扑一致性的动画3D网格，支持无绑定设置，使纹理映射和重定向等应用成为可能，为实际应用提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Generating animated 3D objects is at the heart of many applications, yet most advanced works are typically difficult to apply in practice because of their limited setup, their long runtime, or their limited quality. We introduce ActionMesh, a generative model that predicts production-ready 3D meshes "in action" in a feed-forward manner. Drawing inspiration from early video models, our key insight is to modify existing 3D diffusion models to include a temporal axis, resulting in a framework we dubbed "temporal 3D diffusion". Specifically, we first adapt the 3D diffusion stage to generate a sequence of synchronized latents representing time-varying and independent 3D shapes. Second, we design a temporal 3D autoencoder that translates a sequence of independent shapes into the corresponding deformations of a pre-defined reference shape, allowing us to build an animation. Combining these two components, ActionMesh generates animated 3D meshes from different inputs like a monocular video, a text description, or even a 3D mesh with a text prompt describing its animation. Besides, compared to previous approaches, our method is fast and produces results that are rig-free and topology consistent, hence enabling rapid iteration and seamless applications like texturing and retargeting. We evaluate our model on standard video-to-4D benchmarks (Consistent4D, Objaverse) and report state-of-the-art performances on both geometric accuracy and temporal consistency, demonstrating that our model can deliver animated 3D meshes with unprecedented speed and quality.

Result: 在透视到360°图像和视频生成任务上取得SOTA性能，超越使用真实相机信息的方法；在零样本相机视场角和方向估计基准上表现出竞争力。

Conclusion: 提出了无需相机参数的几何无关框架，实现了高质量的透视到全景生成，揭示了模型对几何的深层理解，展示了在计算机视觉任务中的广泛实用性。

Abstract: Lifting perspective images and videos to 360° panoramas enables immersive 3D world generation. Existing approaches often rely on explicit geometric alignment between the perspective and the equirectangular projection (ERP) space. Yet, this requires known camera metadata, obscuring the application to in-the-wild data where such calibration is typically absent or noisy. We propose 360Anything, a geometry-free framework built upon pre-trained diffusion transformers. By treating the perspective input and the panorama target simply as token sequences, 360Anything learns the perspective-to-equirectangular mapping in a purely data-driven way, eliminating the need for camera information. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on both image and video perspective-to-360° generation, outperforming prior works that use ground-truth camera information. We also trace the root cause of the seam artifacts at ERP boundaries to zero-padding in the VAE encoder, and introduce Circular Latent Encoding to facilitate seamless generation. Finally, we show competitive results in zero-shot camera FoV and orientation estimation benchmarks, demonstrating 360Anything's deep geometric understanding and broader utility in computer vision tasks.

Abstract: Discrete video VAEs underpin modern text-to-video generation and video understanding systems, yet existing tokenizers typically learn visual codebooks at a single scale with limited vocabularies and shallow language supervision, leading to poor cross-modal alignment and zero-shot transfer. We introduce PyraTok, a language-aligned pyramidal tokenizer that learns semantically structured discrete latents across multiple spatiotemporal resolutions. PyraTok builds on a pretrained video VAE and a novel Language aligned Pyramidal Quantization (LaPQ) module that discretizes encoder features at several depths using a shared large binary codebook, yielding compact yet expressive video token sequences. To tightly couple visual tokens with language, PyraTok jointly optimizes multi-scale text-guided quantization and a global autoregressive objective over the token hierarchy. Across ten benchmarks, PyraTok delivers state-of-the-art (SOTA) video reconstruction, consistently improves text-to-video quality, and sets new SOTA zero-shot performance on video segmentation, temporal action localization, and video understanding, scaling robustly to up to 4K/8K resolutions.

Abstract: We study Compositional Video Understanding (CVU), where models must recognize verbs and objects and compose them to generalize to unseen combinations. We find that existing Zero-Shot Compositional Action Recognition (ZS-CAR) models fail primarily due to an overlooked failure mode: object-driven verb shortcuts. Through systematic analysis, we show that this behavior arises from two intertwined factors: severe sparsity and skewness of compositional supervision, and the asymmetric learning difficulty between verbs and objects. As training progresses, the existing ZS-CAR model increasingly ignores visual evidence and overfits to co-occurrence statistics. Consequently, the existing model does not gain the benefit of compositional recognition in unseen verb-object compositions. To address this, we propose RCORE, a simple and effective framework that enforces temporally grounded verb learning. RCORE introduces (i) a composition-aware augmentation that diversifies verb-object combinations without corrupting motion cues, and (ii) a temporal order regularization loss that penalizes shortcut behaviors by explicitly modeling temporal structure. Across two benchmarks, Sth-com and our newly constructed EK100-com, RCORE significantly improves unseen composition accuracy, reduces reliance on co-occurrence bias, and achieves consistently positive compositional gaps. Our findings reveal object-driven shortcuts as a critical limiting factor in ZS-CAR and demonstrate that addressing them is essential for robust compositional video understanding.

TL;DR: 本文基于奖励反馈学习，针对视频扩散模型中相机可控性不足的问题，提出了一种高效的相机感知3D解码器，通过将视频隐变量解码为3D高斯表示来量化奖励，从而提升视频-相机对齐质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于相机控制的视频扩散模型虽然改善了视频与相机的对齐，但相机可控性仍然有限。直接应用现有ReFL方法面临三大挑战：1) 现有奖励模型缺乏评估视频-相机对齐的能力；2) 将隐变量解码为RGB视频计算奖励带来巨大计算开销；3) 3D几何信息在视频解码过程中通常被忽略。

Method: 提出高效的相机感知3D解码器，将视频隐变量和相机姿态解码为3D高斯表示。相机姿态既作为输入，也作为投影参数。视频隐变量与相机姿态的不对齐会导致3D结构几何畸变，产生模糊渲染。基于这一特性，以渲染新视角与真实视角的像素级一致性作为奖励进行优化。此外，引入可见性项，仅对通过几何变形得到的确定性区域进行选择性监督。

Result: 在RealEstate10K和WorldScore基准上进行的大量实验证明了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 通过将视频隐变量解码为3D表示并结合相机感知机制，本方法显著提升了视频扩散模型的相机可控性，同时避免了直接RGB解码带来的计算负担，有效解决了现有方法在视频-相机对齐评估和几何信息利用方面的不足。

Abstract: Recent advances in camera-controlled video diffusion models have significantly improved video-camera alignment. However, the camera controllability still remains limited. In this work, we build upon Reward Feedback Learning and aim to further improve camera controllability. However, directly borrowing existing ReFL approaches faces several challenges. First, current reward models lack the capacity to assess video-camera alignment. Second, decoding latent into RGB videos for reward computation introduces substantial computational overhead. Third, 3D geometric information is typically neglected during video decoding. To address these limitations, we introduce an efficient camera-aware 3D decoder that decodes video latent into 3D representations for reward quantization. Specifically, video latent along with the camera pose are decoded into 3D Gaussians. In this process, the camera pose not only acts as input, but also serves as a projection parameter. Misalignment between the video latent and camera pose will cause geometric distortions in the 3D structure, resulting in blurry renderings. Based on this property, we explicitly optimize pixel-level consistency between the rendered novel views and ground-truth ones as reward. To accommodate the stochastic nature, we further introduce a visibility term that selectively supervises only deterministic regions derived via geometric warping. Extensive experiments conducted on RealEstate10K and WorldScore benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Motivation: 在5G下行控制信道的盲解码场景中，用户设备需要处理多个候选，其中许多不包含有效控制信息。这需要更有效的早期终止机制来节省计算资源和功耗

Method: 1. 从传统极化码出发，选择性剪枝极化内核
2. 修改合成比特信道容量以确保早期可用的非冻结比特
3. 提出了针对PPP码的冻结比特图设计策略

Result: PPP码相较于传统极化码具有显著的性能提升，特别在较大块长度时效果更明显。相比聚合或分割等现有方法，PPP码效率更高且不需要额外的硬件支持

Conclusion: PPP码是一种有效的极化码变体，通过确保早期可用信息比特，显著改善了盲解码中的早期终止性能，为下行信令传输提供了更优的解决方案

Abstract: We introduce a new family of polar-like codes, called Partially Polarized Polar (PPP) codes. PPP codes are constructed from conventional polar codes by selectively pruning polarization kernels, thereby modifying the synthesized bit-channel capacities to ensure a guaranteed number of non-frozen bits available early in decoding. These early-access information bits enable more effective early termination, which is particularly valuable for blind decoding in downlink control channels, where user equipment (UE) must process multiple candidates, many of which carry no valid control information. Our results show that PPP codes offer substantial performance gains over conventional polar codes, particularly at larger block lengths where hardware limitations restrict straightforward scaling. Compared with existing methods such as aggregation or segmentation, PPP codes achieve higher efficiency without the need for additional hardware support.

Abstract: The quantum hashing bound guarantees that rates up to $1-H(p_I, p_X, p_Y, p_Z)$ are achievable for memoryless Pauli channels, but it is not generally tight. A known way to improve achievable rates for certain asymmetric Pauli channels is to apply a small inner stabilizer code to a few channel uses, decode, and treat the resulting logical noise as an induced Pauli channel; reapplying the hashing argument to this induced channel can beat the baseline hashing bound. We generalize this induced-channel viewpoint to arbitrary stabilizer codes used purely as channel transforms. Given any $ [\![ n, k ]\!] $ stabilizer generator set, we construct a full symplectic tableau, compute the induced joint distribution of logical Pauli errors and syndromes under the physical Pauli channel, and obtain an achievable rate via a hashing bound with decoder side information. We perform a structured search over small transforms and report instances that improve the baseline hashing bound for a family of Pauli channels with skewed and independent errors studied in prior work.

TL;DR: 该论文介绍了一类新的(G,f)-散度度量，通过应用非递减函数G于f-散度构造而成，并在信息度量和子可加性理论方面进行了深入研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的f-散度在信息论中扮演重要角色，但研究者希望通过引入函数G扩展这一框架，从而获得更一般的信息度量工具，特别关注子可加性这一关键性质。

Method: 定义(G,f)-散度和相应的(G,f)-信息度量，研究其在乘积分布和乘积信道上的子可加性。建立了降维原则，证明对于广泛的G类函数，只需在二元字母表上验证散度子可加性。针对特定G函数推导了保证子可加性的充分条件。

Result: 为三类特殊G函数（x, log(1+x), -log(1-x)）推导出了保证子可加性的可处理的充分条件，覆盖了许多标准f-散度。建立了降维原则简化子可加性验证。

Conclusion: (G,f)-散度框架扩展了经典f-散度理论，其子可加性性质在信道编码有限码长逆定理、二元假设检验以及球堆积指数框架扩展等方面具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: We introduce a two-parameter family of discrepancy measures, termed \emph{$(G,f)$-divergences}, obtained by applying a non-decreasing function $G$ to an $f$-divergence $D_f$. Building on Csiszár's formulation of mutual $f$-information, we define a corresponding $(G,f)$-information measure $
I_{G,f}(X;Y)$. A central theme of the paper is subadditivity over product distributions and product channels. We develop reduction principles showing that, for broad classes of $G$, it suffices to verify divergence subadditivity on binary alphabets. Specializing to the functions $G(x)\in\{x,\log(1+x),-\log(1-x)\}$, we derive tractable sufficient conditions on $f$ that guarantee subadditivity, covering many standard $f$-divergences. Finally, we present applications to finite-blocklength converses for channel coding, bounds in binary hypothesis testing, and an extension of the Shannon--Gallager--Berlekamp sphere-packing exponent framework to subadditive $(G,f)$-divergences.

TL;DR: 本文针对ISAC信道建模中的关键缺陷，提出环境语义作为统一抽象，通过生成式AI构建语义孪生信道模型来平衡准确性与复杂性，以支持可控仿真、数据集生成和标准化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前通信感知一体化（ISAC）信道建模存在显著矛盾：统计模型面向通信优化但忽略关键的感知特征，确定性模型虽精确但计算效率低下，无法支撑系统级ISAC评估。因此需要一种能够统一环境和信道行为的抽象——环境语义。

Method: 首先明确了环境语义在ISAC信道建模中的必要性和含义，并建立语义与多级可观测信道结构的关联。其次，提出语义导向的信道建模原则，在保持环境语义的同时抽象不必要细节。最后，引入生成式AI赋能的语义孪生信道模型（STCM），从语义条件下生成物理可信的信道实现。

Result: 通过案例研究表明，STCM在具有挑战性的多视图场景中保持了语义一致性，证实了该模型能够支持可控仿真、数据集生成和可复现的ISAC基准测试，为未来设计和标准化提供了实用路径。

Conclusion: 环境语义为ISAC信道建模的矛盾提供了理论框架，生成式AI支持的语义孪生信道模型则实现了精度与复杂性的平衡，有望推动ISAC的仿真、数据生成和标准化进程。

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) increasingly exposes a gap in today's channel modeling. Efficient statistical models focus on coarse communication-centric metrics, and therefore miss the weak but critical multipath signatures for sensing, whereas deterministic models are computationally inefficient to scale for system-level ISAC evaluation. This gap calls for a unifying abstraction that can couple what the environment means for sensing with how the channel behaves for communication, namely, environmental semantics. This article clarifies the meaning and essentiality of environmental semantics in ISAC channel modeling and establishes how semantics is connected to observable channel structures across multiple semantic levels. Based on this perspective, a semantics-oriented channel modeling principle was advocated, which preserves environmental semantics while abstracting unnecessary detail to balance accuracy and complexity. Then, a generative AI-empowered semantic twin channel model (STCM) was introduced to generate a family of physically plausible channel realizations representative of a semantic condition. Case studies further show semantic consistency under challenging multi-view settings, suggesting a practical path to controllable simulation, dataset generation, and reproducible ISAC benchmarking toward future design and standardization.

Abstract: It is well known that there is a strong connection between entropy inequalities and submodularity, since the entropy of a collection of random variables is a submodular function. Unifying frameworks for information inequalities arising from submodularity were developed by Madiman and Tetali (2010) and Sason (2022). Madiman and Tetali (2010) established strong and weak fractional inequalities that subsume classical results such as Han's inequality and Shearer's lemma. Sason (2022) introduced a convex-functional framework for generalizing Han's inequality, and derived unified inequalities for submodular and supermodular functions. In this work, we build on these frameworks and make three contributions. First, we establish convex-functional generalizations of the strong and weak Madiman and Tetali inequalities for submodular functions. Second, using a special case of the strong Madiman-Tetali inequality, we derive a new Loomis-Whitney-type projection inequality for finite point sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$, which improves upon the classical Loomis-Whitney bound by incorporating slice-level structural information. Finally, we study an extremal graph theory problem that recovers and extends the previously known results of Sason (2022) and Boucheron et al., employing Shearer's lemma in contrast to the use of Han's inequality in those works.

Abstract: Channel estimation is a fundamental challenge in massive multiple-input multiple-output systems, where estimation accuracy governs the spectral efficiency and link reliability. In this work, we introduce Recursive Flow (RC-Flow), a novel solver that leverages pre-trained flow matching priors to robustly recover channel state information from noisy, under-determined measurements. Different from conventional open-loop generative models, our approach establishes a closed-loop refinement framework via a serial restart mechanism and anchored trajectory rectification. By synergizing flow-consistent prior directions with data-fidelity proximal projections, the proposed RC-Flow achieves robust channel reconstruction and delivers state-of-the-art performance across diverse noise levels, particularly in noise-dominated scenarios. The framework is further augmented by an adaptive dual-scheduling strategy, offering flexible management of the trade-off between convergence speed and reconstruction accuracy. Theoretically, we analyze the Jacobian spectral radius of the recursive operator to prove its global asymptotic stability. Numerical results demonstrate that RC-Flow reduces inference latency by two orders of magnitude while achieving a 2.7 dB performance gain in low signal-to-noise ratio regimes compared to the score-based baseline.

Abstract: Set Shaping Theory (SST) moves beyond the classical fixed-space model by constructing bijective mappings the original sequence set into structured regions of a larger sequence space. These shaped subsets are characterized by a reduced average information content, measured by the product of the empirical entropy and the length, yielding (N +k)H0(f(s)) < NH0(s), which represents the universal coding limit when the source distribution is unknown. The principal experimental difficulty in applying Set Shaping Theory to non-uniform sequences arises from the need to order the sequences of both the original and transformed sets according to their information content. An exact ordering of these sets entails exponential complexity, rendering a direct implementation impractical. In this article, we show that this obstacle can be overcome by performing an approximate but informative ordering that preserves the structural requirements of SST while achieving the shaping gain predicted by the theory. This result extends previous experimental findings obtained for uniformly distributed sequences and demonstrates that the shaping advantage of SST persists for non-uniform sequences. Finally, to ensure full reproducibility, the software implementing the proposed method has been made publicly available on GitHub, enabling independent verification of the results reported in this work

Abstract: The problem of blind identification of channel codes at a receiver involves identifying a code chosen by a transmitter from a known code-family, by observing the transmitted codewords through the channel. Most existing approaches for code-identification are contingent upon the codes in the family having some special structure, and are often computationally expensive otherwise. Further, rigorous analytical guarantees on the performance of these existing techniques are largely absent. This work presents a new method for code-identification on the binary symmetric channel (BSC), inspired by the framework of subspace codes for operator channels, carefully combining principles of hamming-metric and subspace-metric decoding. We refer to this method as the minimum denoised subspace discrepancy decoder. We present theoretical guarantees for code-identification using this decoder, for bounded-weight errors, and also present a bound on the probability of error when used on the BSC. Simulations demonstrate the improved performance of our decoder for random linear codes beyond existing general-purpose techniques, across most channel conditions and even with a limited number of received vectors.

TL;DR: 论文通过覆盖数组方法，为下行大规模随机接入（DMRA）问题构建确定性变长码，将开销降低至不超过1+log₂e bits，无需依赖随机编码并突破了与用户总数相关的对数级开销限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在下行大规模随机接入场景中，基站向大规模用户中的小部分活跃用户传输消息。传统方法显式编码活跃用户身份会产生与总用户数对数的显著开销。最近研究表明开销可降至与总用户数无关的上界，但尚需确定性构造方法以改进随机编码方案。

Method: 将DMRA码设计识别为组合学中的覆盖数组问题，利用覆盖数组理论构建确定性变长码，提供系统的构造方法而非依赖随机编码论证。

Result: 证明了存在确定性构造的变长码，其开销不大于1+log₂e bits，显著改善了之前的上界，为DMRA提供了更优的确定性编码方案。

Conclusion: 通过覆盖数组框架建立了DMRA码设计的确定性构造，将开销严格限定在1+log₂e bits内，为大规模随机接入系统提供了理论基础和实用编码方法。

Abstract: In downlink massive random access (DMRA), a base station transmits messages to a typically small subset of active users, selected randomly from a massive number of total users. Explicitly encoding the identities of active users would incur a significant overhead scaling logarithmically with the number of total users. Recently, via a random coding argument, Song, Attiah and Yu have shown that the overhead can be reduced to within some upper bound irrespective of the number of total users. In this remark, recognizing that the code design for DMRA is an instance of covering arrays in combinatorics, we show that there exists deterministic construction of variable-length codes that incur an overhead no greater than $1 + log_2 e$ bits.

Abstract: Neural networks possess incredible capabilities for extracting abstract features from data. Electromagnetic computing harnesses wave propagation to execute computational operations. Metasurfaces, composed of subwavelength meta-atoms, are capable of engineering electromagnetic waves in unprecedented ways. What happens when combining these three cutting-edge technologies? This question has sparked a surge of interest in designing physical neural networks using stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) technology, with the aim of implementing various computational tasks by directly processing electromagnetic waves. SIMs open up an exciting avenue toward high-speed, massively parallel, and low-power signal processing in the electromagnetic domain. This article provides a comprehensive overview of SIM technology, commencing with its evolutionary development. We subsequently examine its theoretical foundations and existing SIM prototypes in depth. Furthermore, the optimization/training strategies conceived to configure SIMs for achieving the desired functionalities are discussed from two different perspectives. Additionally, we explore the diverse applications of SIM technology across the communication, sensing, and computing domains, presenting experimental evidence that highlights its distinctive advantages in supporting multiple functions within a single device. Finally, we identify critical technical challenges that must be addressed to deploy SIMs in next-generation wireless networks and shed light on promising research directions to unlock their full potential.

Abstract: The low-altitude economy is integral to the advancement of numerous sectors, necessitating the development of advanced low-altitude surveillance techniques. Nevertheless, conventional methods encounter limitations of high deployment costs and low signal strength. This study proposes a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) network for low-altitude surveillance. This network employs RISs to reflect ISAC signals into low-altitude space for sensing. To enhance signal strength, we employ active RIS (ARIS) to amplify the signals. Moreover, in order to avoid error propagation and data association in traditional sensing methods, we model low-altitude surveillance as an imaging problem based on compressed sensing theory, which can be solved through the subspace pursuit algorithm. We derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of the proposed RIS-aided low-altitude imaging system and analyze the impacts of various system parameters on sensing performance, providing guidance for ISAC system configuration. Numerical results show that ARIS outperforms passive RIS under identical power constraints, achieving effective imaging and target detection at altitudes up to 300 meters.

Abstract: Tri-hybrid beamforming architectures have been proposed to enable energy-efficient communications systems in extra-largescale antenna arrays using low-cost programmable metasurface antennas. We study the tri-hybrid beamforming design for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) to improve both communications and sensing performances. Specifically, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem that balances communications signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the sensing power at a target direction, subject to constraints on the total power consumption and physical limitations inherent to the trihybrid beamforming architecture. We develop an efficient iterative algorithm in which the variables are updated in a closed form at each iteration, leading to a low-complexity and fast-execution design. Numerical results show that the tri-hybrid architecture improves spatial gain and energy efficiency, though with reduced beam alignment capability compared to conventional hybrid beamforming architectures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的纠错码虽然可以达到香农容量，但往往译码复杂度较高。如何构建既接近容量、又能高效译码的纠错码是一个重要问题，特别是当噪声模型为对抗性错误时难度更大。

Method: 该方法的核心是构造张量Reed-Muller码(TRM码)，其码字是多元多项式的求值向量。作者提出了两种具体构造：第一种采用三层张量(t=3)，第二种适用于任意t≥4。关键工具是一个多项式时间的译码算法，能够纠正接近于最小距离一半的错误。

Result: 1) 第一种构造实现了n^{-ω(log n)}的错误概率和O(n log log n)的译码时间；2) 第二种构造实现了2^{-n^{(1/2-1/2(t-2)-o(1))}}的错误概率和O(n log n)的译码时间。两种构造都能在容量以下的任意固定速率R下工作。

Conclusion: 张量Reed-Muller码结合了接近容量的性能和准线性时间译码的优势，为构造高效可译码提供了一种有效途径。文中提出的通用张量码译码算法是关键技术贡献，为更广泛的码类提供了有效的错误纠正能力。

Abstract: Define the codewords of the Tensor Reed-Muller code $\mathsf{TRM}(r_1,m_1;r_2,m_2;\dots;r_t,m_t)$ to be the evaluation vectors of all multivariate polynomials in the variables $\left\{x_{ij}\right\}_{i=1,\dots,t}^{j=1,\dots m_i}$ with degree at most $r_i$ in the variables $x_{i1},x_{i2},\dots,x_{im_i}$. The generator matrix of $\mathsf{TRM}(r_1,m_1;\dots;r_t,m_t)$ is thus the tensor product of the generator matrices of the Reed-Muller codes $\mathsf{RM}(r_1,m_1),\dots, \mathsf{RM}(r_t,m_t)$.
  We show that for any constant rate $R$ below capacity, one can construct a Tensor Reed-Muller code $\mathsf{TRM}(r_1,m_1;\dotsc;r_t,m_t)$ of rate $R$ that is decodable in quasilinear time. For any blocklength $n$, we provide two constructions of such codes:
  1) Our first construction (with $t=3$) has error probability $n^{-ω(\log n)}$ and decoding time $O(n\log\log n)$.
  2) Our second construction, for any $t\geq 4$, has error probability $2^{-n^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2(t-2)}-o(1)}}$ and decoding time $O(n\log n)$.
  One of our main tools is a polynomial-time algorithm for decoding an arbitrary tensor code $C=C_1\otimes\dotsc\otimes C_t$ from $\frac{d_{\min}(C)}{2\max\{d_{\min}(C_1),\dotsc,d_{\min}(C_t) \}}-1$ adversarial errors. Crucially, this algorithm does not require the codes $C_1,\dotsc,C_t$ to themselves be decodable in polynomial time.

Abstract: The work considers the $N$-server distributed computing setting with $K$ users requesting functions that are arbitrary multi-variable polynomial evaluations of $L$ real (potentially non-linear) basis subfunctions. Our aim is to seek efficient task-allocation and data-communication techniques that reduce computation and communication costs. Towards this, we take a tensor-theoretic approach, in which we represent the requested non-linearly decomposable functions using a properly designed tensor $\bar{\mathcal{F}}$, whose sparse decomposition into a tensor $\bar{\mathcal{E}}$ and matrix $\mathbf{D}$ directly defines the task assignment, connectivity, and communication patterns. We here design an achievable scheme, employing novel fixed-support SVD-based tensor factorization methods and careful multi-dimensional tiling of subtensors, yielding computation and communication protocols whose costs are derived here, and which are shown to perform substantially better than the state of art.

Motivation: 现有基于数据新鲜度的指标无法准确衡量驱动行为的及时性，特别是在需要控制权限或能量可用性的约束条件下。需要开发新指标来捕捉驱动行为的端到端及时性，理解系统参数对行为及时性的影响。

Conclusion: 提出的AoAI指标和分析结果为理解驱动系统的及时性语义提供了新视角，揭示了系统参数对行为及时性的复杂影响，有助于设计更有效的通信驱动系统。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the timeliness of actions in communication systems where actuation is constrained by control permissions or energy availability. Building on the Age of Actuation (AoA) metric, which quantifies the timeliness of actions independently of data freshness, we introduce a new metric, the \emph{Age of Actuated Information (AoAI)}. AoAI captures the end-to-end timeliness of actions by explicitly accounting for the age of the data packet at the moment it is actuated. We analyze and characterize both AoA and AoAI in discrete-time systems with data storage capabilities under multiple actuation scenarios. The actuator requires both a data packet and an actuation opportunity, which may be provided by a controller or enabled by harvested energy. Data packets may be stored either in a single-packet buffer or an infinite-capacity queue for future actuation. For these settings, we derive closed-form expressions for the average AoA and AoAI and investigate their structural differences. While AoA and AoAI coincide in instantaneous actuation systems, they differentiate when data buffering is present. Our results reveal counterintuitive regimes in which increasing update or actuation rates degrade action timeliness for both AoA and AoAI. Moreover, as part of the analysis, we obtain a novel closed-form characterization of the steady-state distribution of a Geo/Geo/1 queue operating under the FCFS discipline, expressed solely in terms of the queue length and the age of the head-of-line packet. The proposed metrics and analytical results provide new insights into the semantics of timeliness in systems where information ultimately serves the purpose of actuation.

Motivation: 磁悬浮球系统在精密应用中有重要价值，但系统非线性且不稳定。研究旨在开发有效的控制策略以实现稳定悬浮，并比较不同控制方法的性能。

Method: 建立系统状态空间模型并确定平衡点。进行反馈线性化，验证系统可控性与可观性。研究三种控制策略：基于极点配置的状态反馈控制、全阶观测器设计、以及基于LQR的最优状态反馈控制。通过Simulink仿真验证线性化和非线性模型的性能。

Abstract: This paper presents the modeling, control design, and performance analysis of a Magnetic Ball Suspension System (MBSS), a nonlinear and inherently unstable electromechanical system used in various precision applications. The system's primary objective is to levitate a steel ball using electromagnetic force without physical contact, thereby eliminating frictional losses. A comprehensive state-space model was developed, capturing both the mechanical and electrical dynamics. The equilibrium points of the system were determined through feedback linearization using the Jacobian matrix. To ensure system stability, controllability and observability analyses were conducted, confirming that state feedback and observer-based control strategies could be effectively implemented. Three distinct control methods were explored: pole placement-based state feedback control, full-order observer design, and optimal state feedback control using the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR). Each control strategy was validated through Simulink simulations for both linearized and nonlinear models. Simulation results demonstrated that the linearized system consistently achieved desired performance with minimal oscillations, whereas the nonlinear system exhibited significant transient oscillations before stabilization. The full-order observer enhanced estimation accuracy, enabling effective control where direct state measurement was impractical. The LQR-based control offered improved robustness and minimized control effort, though its performance was comparable to standard state feedback in some cases.

Conclusion: 研究表明，在结构化、标准参照的以二元问题为基础的框架下，GenAI可对工程数学评估进行与人类专家水平相当的评分，其核心贡献在于一种能够将高质量、可扩展的形成性反馈直接融入考核流程的方法。未来的工作应进一步调查学生对GenAI评分与反馈的接受程度。

Abstract: PURPOSE OR GOAL: This study investigates how GenAI can be integrated with a criterion-referenced grading framework to improve the efficiency and quality of grading for mathematical assessments in engineering. It specifically explores the challenges demonstrators face with manual, model solution-based grading and how a GenAI-supported system can be designed to reliably identify student errors, provide high-quality feedback, and support human graders. The research also examines human graders' perceptions of the effectiveness of this GenAI-assisted approach. ACTUAL OR ANTICIPATED OUTCOMES: The study found that GenAI achieved an overall grading accuracy of 92.5%, comparable to two experienced human graders. The two researchers, who also served as subject demonstrators, perceived the GenAI as a helpful second reviewer that improved accuracy by catching small errors and provided more complete feedback than they could manually. A central outcome was the significant enhancement of formative feedback. However, they noted the GenAI tool is not yet reliable enough for autonomous use, especially with unconventional solutions. CONCLUSIONS/RECOMMENDATIONS/SUMMARY: This study demonstrates that GenAI, when paired with a structured, criterion-referenced framework using binary questions, can grade engineering mathematical assessments with an accuracy comparable to human experts. Its primary contribution is a novel methodological approach that embeds the generation of high-quality, scalable formative feedback directly into the assessment workflow. Future work should investigate student perceptions of GenAI grading and feedback.

Abstract: Adaptive traffic signal control (TSC) has demonstrated strong effectiveness in managing dynamic traffic flows. However, conventional methods often struggle when unforeseen traffic incidents occur (e.g., accidents and road maintenance), which typically require labor-intensive and inefficient manual interventions by traffic police officers. Large Language Models (LLMs) appear to be a promising solution thanks to their remarkable reasoning and generalization capabilities. Nevertheless, existing works often propose to replace existing TSC systems with LLM-based systems, which can be (i) unreliable due to the inherent hallucinations of LLMs and (ii) costly due to the need for system replacement. To address the issues of existing works, we propose a hierarchical framework that augments existing TSC systems with LLMs, whereby a virtual traffic police agent at the upper level dynamically fine-tunes selected parameters of signal controllers at the lower level in response to real-time traffic incidents. To enhance domain-specific reliability in response to unforeseen traffic incidents, we devise a self-refined traffic language retrieval system (TLRS), whereby retrieval-augmented generation is employed to draw knowledge from a tailored traffic language database that encompasses traffic conditions and controller operation principles. Moreover, we devise an LLM-based verifier to update the TLRS continuously over the reasoning process. Our results show that LLMs can serve as trustworthy virtual traffic police officers that can adapt conventional TSC methods to unforeseen traffic incidents with significantly improved operational efficiency and reliability.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to stability analysis for grid-connected converters utilizing Scaled Relative Graphs (SRG). Our method effectively decouples grid and converter dynamics, thereby establishing a comprehensive and efficient framework for evaluating closed-loop stability. Our analysis accommodates both linear and non-linear loads, enhancing its practical applicability. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our stability assessment remains unaffected by angular variations resulting from dq-frame transformations, significantly increasing the method's robustness and versatility. The effectiveness of our approach is validated in several simulation case studies, which illustrate its broad applicability in modern power systems.

Abstract: This paper presents the Dynamic Tactile Sensing System that utilizes robotic tactile sensing in conjunction with reinforcement learning to locate and characterize embedded inclusions. A dual arm robot is integrated with an optical Tactile Imaging Sensor that utilizes the Soft Actor Critic Algorithm to acquire tactile data based on a pixel intensity reward. A Dynamic Interrogation procedure for tactile exploration is developed that enables the robot to first localize inclusion and refine their positions for precise imaging.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the model reduction problem for linear hybrid systems via the interconnection-based technique called moment matching. We consider two classical interconnections, namely the direct and swapped interconnections, in the hybrid setting, and we present families of reduced-order models for each interconnection via a hybrid characterisation of the steady-state responses. By combining the results for each interconnection, the design of a reduced-order model that achieves moment matching simultaneously for both interconnections is studied. In addition, we show that the presented results have simplified counterparts when the jumps of the hybrid system are periodic. A numerical simulation is finally given to illustrate the results.

Method: 提出一个安全临界控制框架，明确纳入过程噪声和测量噪声引起的不确定性，并合成能够适应不确定性水平的控制器。该框架在线性设置下存在闭式解。

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效处理状态估计不确定性，为随机系统在噪声测量下的安全控制提供了理论保证，并在不同类别系统上验证了有效性。

Abstract: Ensuring safety for autonomous systems under uncertainty remains challenging, particularly when safety of the true state is required despite the true state not being fully known. Control barrier functions (CBFs) have become widely adopted as safety filters. However, standard CBF formulations do not explicitly account for state estimation uncertainty and its propagation, especially for stochastic systems evolving on manifolds. In this paper, we propose a safety-critical control framework with a provable bound on the finite-time safety probability for stochastic systems under noisy state information. The proposed framework explicitly incorporates the uncertainty arising from both process and measurement noise, and synthesizes controllers that adapt to the level of uncertainty. The framework admits closed-form solutions in linear settings, and experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness on systems whose state spaces range from Euclidean space to Lie groups.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The computational burden of attention in long-context language models has motivated two largely independent lines of work: sparse attention mechanisms that reduce complexity by attending to selected tokens, and gated attention variants that improve training sta-bility while mitigating the attention sink phenomenon. We observe that these approaches address complementary weaknesses and propose Gated Sparse Attention (GSA), an architecture that realizes the benefits of both. GSA incorporates a gated lightning indexer with sigmoid activations that produce bounded, interpretable selection scores, an adaptive sparsity controller that modulates the number of attended tokens based on local uncertainty, and dual gating at the value and output stages. We establish theoretical foundations for the approach, including complexity analysis, expressiveness results, and convergence guarantees. In experiments with 1.7B parameter models trained on 400B tokens, GSA matches the efficiency of sparse-only baselines (12-16x speedup at 128K context) while achieving the quality gains associated with gated attention: perplexity improves from 6.03 to 5.70, RULER scores at 128K context nearly double, and attention to the first token, a proxy for attention sinks, drops from 47% to under 4%. Training stability improves markedly, with loss spikes reduced by 98%.

Abstract: The rapid development of automated scientific survey generation technology has made it increasingly important to establish a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the quality of generated surveys.Nearly all existing evaluation benchmarks rely on flawed selection criteria such as citation counts and structural coherence to select human-written surveys as the ground truth survey datasets, and then use surface-level metrics such as structural quality and reference relevance to evaluate generated surveys.However, these benchmarks have two key issues: (1) the ground truth survey datasets are unreliable because of a lack academic dimension annotations; (2) the evaluation metrics only focus on the surface quality of the survey such as logical coherence. Both issues lead to existing benchmarks cannot assess to evaluate their deep "academic value", such as the core research objectives and the critical analysis of different studies. To address the above problems, we propose DeepSurvey-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate the academic value of generated surveys. Specifically, our benchmark propose a comprehensive academic value evaluation criteria covering three dimensions: informational value, scholarly communication value, and research guidance value. Based on this criteria, we construct a reliable dataset with academic value annotations, and evaluate the deep academic value of the generated surveys. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our benchmark is highly consistent with human performance in assessing the academic value of generated surveys.

Abstract: In recent years, the rapid evolution of large vision-language models (LVLMs) has driven a paradigm shift in multimodal fake news detection (MFND), transforming it from traditional feature-engineering approaches to unified, end-to-end multimodal reasoning frameworks. Early methods primarily relied on shallow fusion techniques to capture correlations between text and images, but they struggled with high-level semantic understanding and complex cross-modal interactions. The emergence of LVLMs has fundamentally changed this landscape by enabling joint modeling of vision and language with powerful representation learning, thereby enhancing the ability to detect misinformation that leverages both textual narratives and visual content. Despite these advances, the field lacks a systematic survey that traces this transition and consolidates recent developments. To address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of MFND through the lens of LVLMs. We first present a historical perspective, mapping the evolution from conventional multimodal detection pipelines to foundation model-driven paradigms. Next, we establish a structured taxonomy covering model architectures, datasets, and performance benchmarks. Furthermore, we analyze the remaining technical challenges, including interpretability, temporal reasoning, and domain generalization. Finally, we outline future research directions to guide the next stage of this paradigm shift. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey to systematically document and analyze the transformative role of LVLMs in combating multimodal fake news.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The rapid emergence of new entities -- driven by cultural shifts, evolving trends, and personalized user data -- poses a significant challenge for existing Speech Large Language Models (Speech LLMs). While these models excel at general conversational tasks, their static training knowledge limits their ability to recognize domain-specific terms such as contact names, playlists, or technical jargon. Existing solutions primarily rely on prompting, which suffers from poor scalability: as the entity list grows, prompting encounters context window limitations, increased inference latency, and the "lost-in-the-middle" phenomenon. An alternative approach, Generative Error Correction (GEC), attempts to rewrite transcripts via post-processing but frequently suffers from "over-correction", introducing hallucinations of entities that were never spoken.
  In this work, we introduce LOGIC (Logit-Space Integration for Contextual Biasing), an efficient and robust framework that operates directly in the decoding layer. Unlike prompting, LOGIC decouples context injection from input processing, ensuring constant-time complexity relative to prompt length. Extensive experiments using the Phi-4-MM model across 11 multilingual locales demonstrate that LOGIC achieves an average 9% relative reduction in Entity WER with a negligible 0.30% increase in False Alarm Rate.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We propose a novel way to evaluate sycophancy of LLMs in a direct and neutral way, mitigating various forms of uncontrolled bias, noise, or manipulative language, deliberately injected to prompts in prior works. A key novelty in our approach is the use of LLM-as-a-judge, evaluation of sycophancy as a zero-sum game in a bet setting. Under this framework, sycophancy serves one individual (the user) while explicitly incurring cost on another. Comparing four leading models - Gemini 2.5 Pro, ChatGpt 4o, Mistral-Large-Instruct-2411, and Claude Sonnet 3.7 - we find that while all models exhibit sycophantic tendencies in the common setting, in which sycophancy is self-serving to the user and incurs no cost on others, Claude and Mistral exhibit "moral remorse" and over-compensate for their sycophancy in case it explicitly harms a third party. Additionally, we observed that all models are biased toward the answer proposed last. Crucially, we find that these two phenomena are not independent; sycophancy and recency bias interact to produce `constructive interference' effect, where the tendency to agree with the user is exacerbated when the user's opinion is presented last.

Abstract: The unification of neural and symbolic approaches to artificial intelligence remains a central open challenge. In this work, we introduce a tensor network formalism, which captures sparsity principles originating in the different approaches in tensor decompositions. In particular, we describe a basis encoding scheme for functions and model neural decompositions as tensor decompositions. The proposed formalism can be applied to represent logical formulas and probability distributions as structured tensor decompositions. This unified treatment identifies tensor network contractions as a fundamental inference class and formulates efficiently scaling reasoning algorithms, originating from probability theory and propositional logic, as contraction message passing schemes. The framework enables the definition and training of hybrid logical and probabilistic models, which we call Hybrid Logic Network. The theoretical concepts are accompanied by the python library tnreason, which enables the implementation and practical use of the proposed architectures.

Abstract: This paper examines how to make large language models reliable for high-stakes legal work by reducing hallucinations. It distinguishes three AI paradigms: (1) standalone generative models ("creative oracle"), (2) basic retrieval-augmented systems ("expert archivist"), and (3) an advanced, end-to-end optimized RAG system ("rigorous archivist"). The authors introduce two reliability metrics -False Citation Rate (FCR) and Fabricated Fact Rate (FFR)- and evaluate 2,700 judicial-style answers from 12 LLMs across 75 legal tasks using expert, double-blind review. Results show that standalone models are unsuitable for professional use (FCR above 30%), while basic RAG greatly reduces errors but still leaves notable misgrounding. Advanced RAG, using techniques such as embedding fine-tuning, re-ranking, and self-correction, reduces fabrication to negligible levels (below 0.2%). The study concludes that trustworthy legal AI requires rigor-focused, retrieval-based architectures emphasizing verification and traceability, and provides an evaluation framework applicable to other high-risk domains.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) toward multimodal, high-stakes enterprise applications has outpaced the development of domain specific evaluation benchmarks. Existing datasets often rely on general-domain corpora or purely textual retrieval, failing to capture the complexity of specialized technical documents where information is inextricably multimodal and reasoning requires synthesizing disjoint evidence. We address this gap by introducing MiRAGE, a Multiagent framework for RAG systems Evaluation, that leverages a collaborative swarm of specialized agents to generate verified, domain-specific, multimodal, and multi-hop Question-Answer datasets. MiRAGE orchestrates a swarm of specialized agents: a recursive context optimization loop to aggregate scattered evidence, an adversarial verifier agent to guarantee factual grounding, and an agent to recognize the expert persona and the relevant domain to mimic expert cognitive workflows. Extensive empirical evaluation across four distinct domains (regulations, finance, quantitative biology, and journalism) demonstrates that MiRAGE generates datasets with significantly higher reasoning complexity (>2.3 average hops) and factual faithfulness. Our ablation studies point that MiRAGE can be powered by LLMs if textual descriptions of the images are available. Visual grounding still remains a frontier. By automating the creation of gold standard evaluation datasets that reflect the latent thematic structure of proprietary corpora, MiRAGE provides the necessary infrastructure to rigorously benchmark the next generation information retrieval systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了TRACK基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在面临新旧知识冲突时，如何在多步推理中传播更新知识。研究发现提供更新事实反而可能降低模型推理性能，且性能随更新事实增多而恶化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的LLMs知识更新方法（上下文更新或知识编辑）会在知识冲突时传播错误推理，而现有基准主要关注单知识更新和事实回忆，缺乏对这种更新影响下游多步推理的评估。

Method: 作者构建了TRACK基准测试，涵盖WIKI、CODE和MATH三种推理密集型场景，引入多个现实的冲突来模拟真实世界的复杂性，系统地测试LLMs在多步推理中传播冲突知识的能力。

Result: 实验显示，为模型提供更新事实进行推理反而可能比不提供更新事实表现更差，且性能下降随着提供的更新事实增多而加剧。这种失败既源于无法忠实整合更新事实，也源于即使知识整合后仍存在推理缺陷。

Conclusion: TRACK为测量和指导未来在多步推理中传播冲突知识的研究进展，提供了一个严谨的新基准，揭示了当前LLMs在这方面的严重局限性。

Abstract: A common solution for mitigating outdated or incorrect information in Large Language Models (LLMs) is to provide updated facts in-context or through knowledge editing. However, these methods introduce knowledge conflicts when the knowledge update fails to overwrite the model's parametric knowledge, which propagate to faulty reasoning. Current benchmarks for this problem, however, largely focus only on single knowledge updates and fact recall without evaluating how these updates affect downstream reasoning. In this work, we introduce TRACK (Testing Reasoning Amid Conflicting Knowledge), a new benchmark for studying how LLMs propagate new knowledge through multi-step reasoning when it conflicts with the model's initial parametric knowledge. Spanning three reasoning-intensive scenarios (WIKI, CODE, and MATH), TRACK introduces multiple, realistic conflicts to mirror real-world complexity. Our results on TRACK reveal that providing updated facts to models for reasoning can worsen performance compared to providing no updated facts to a model, and that this performance degradation exacerbates as more updated facts are provided. We show this failure stems from both inability to faithfully integrate updated facts, but also flawed reasoning even when knowledge is integrated. TRACK provides a rigorous new benchmark to measure and guide future progress on propagating conflicting knowledge in multi-step reasoning.

Motivation: 当前基于Transformer的迁移学习在情感分析等应用AI任务中取得了显著准确率提升，但研究发现这种提升伴随着中立性缺失和情感极化问题，这对依赖情感分析结果的产业应用构成了严重可靠性挑战。

Method: 通过实验观察发现，Transformer模型在提升某一类情感（如积极或消极）准确率的同时，往往导致其他类别（特别是中立情感）的准确性下降，造成情感预测结果的极化现象。

Result: 实验结果表明，Transformer模型在情感分析中的准确率提升通常伴随着中立性识别能力的显著下降，形成"准确率提升-中立性丧失"的权衡关系，这对实际应用场景产生了负面影响。

Conclusion: 虽然Transformer提高了情感分析的整体准确率，但中立性的缺失和情感极化问题限制了其在产业级应用中的可靠性和实用性，需要开发新的方法来平衡准确率与中立性保持。

Abstract: The use of Transfer Learning & Transformers has steadily improved accuracy and has significantly contributed in solving complex computation problems. However, this transformer led accuracy improvement in Applied AI Analytics specifically in sentiment analytics comes with the dark side. It is observed during experiments that a lot of these improvements in transformer led accuracy of one class of sentiment has been at the cost of polarization of another class of sentiment and the failing of neutrality. This lack of neutrality poses an acute problem in the Applied NLP space, which relies heavily on the computational outputs of sentiment analytics for reliable industry ready tasks.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of traffic crash severity is critical for improving emergency response and public safety planning. Although recent large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning capabilities, their single-agent architectures often struggle with heterogeneous, domain-specific crash data and tend to generate biased or unstable predictions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes TransportAgents, a hybrid multi-agent framework that integrates category-specific LLM reasoning with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) integration module. Each specialized agent focuses on a particular subset of traffic information, such as demographics, environmental context, or incident details, to produce intermediate severity assessments that are subsequently fused into a unified prediction. Extensive experiments on two complementary U.S. datasets, the Consumer Product Safety Risk Management System (CPSRMS) and the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System (NEISS), demonstrate that TransportAgents consistently outperforms both traditional machine learning and advanced LLM-based baselines. Across three representative backbones, including closed-source models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o, as well as open-source models such as LLaMA-3.3, the framework exhibits strong robustness, scalability, and cross-dataset generalizability. A supplementary distributional analysis further shows that TransportAgents produces more balanced and well-calibrated severity predictions than standard single-agent LLM approaches, highlighting its interpretability and reliability for safety-critical decision support applications.

Motivation: 当前世界模型存在『视觉混淆』问题——误将高保真视频生成等同于对物理与因果动态的理解，但实际这些模型常在安全关键决策中违反不变约束、干预失效。医疗等试错成本高昂的领域迫切需要能支持反事实推理的可靠世界模型。

Method: 1. 系统性分析现有世界模型在视觉保真度与真实世界理解间的认知偏差；2. 提出重构世界模型为『行动仿真器』的三要素：结构化4D时空接口、领域约束感知的动态建模、闭环决策评估框架；3. 以医疗决策为『认知压力测试』场景，验证模型在反事实推理、干预规划和长时域预见方面的实效性。

Result: 研究表明：1. 像素级预测精度与物理因果理解存在本质脱节；2. 传统视觉评估指标无法反映模型在安全关键场景中的可靠性；3. 基于约束感知和结构化接口的仿真器在医疗等高风险领域展现出更强的决策支撑能力。

Conclusion: 世界模型的价值应由其支持反事实推理和长时域规划的能力决定，而非视觉逼真度。未来研究应转向构建领域约束内化的行动仿真器，并通过闭环决策任务（如医疗干预）作为核心评估标准。

Abstract: A world model is an AI system that simulates how an environment evolves under actions, enabling planning through imagined futures rather than reactive perception. Current world models, however, suffer from visual conflation: the mistaken assumption that high-fidelity video generation implies an understanding of physical and causal dynamics. We show that while modern models excel at predicting pixels, they frequently violate invariant constraints, fail under intervention, and break down in safety-critical decision-making. This survey argues that visual realism is an unreliable proxy for world understanding. Instead, effective world models must encode causal structure, respect domain-specific constraints, and remain stable over long horizons. We propose a reframing of world models as actionable simulators rather than visual engines, emphasizing structured 4D interfaces, constraint-aware dynamics, and closed-loop evaluation. Using medical decision-making as an epistemic stress test, where trial-and-error is impossible and errors are irreversible, we demonstrate that a world model's value is determined not by how realistic its rollouts appear, but by its ability to support counterfactual reasoning, intervention planning, and robust long-horizon foresight.

Abstract: Whether Large Language Models (LLMs) truly possess human-like Theory of Mind (ToM) capabilities has garnered increasing attention. However, existing benchmarks remain largely restricted to narrow paradigms like false belief tasks, failing to capture the full spectrum of human cognitive mechanisms. We introduce CogToM, a comprehensive, theoretically grounded benchmark comprising over 8000 bilingual instances across 46 paradigms, validated by 49 human annotator.A systematic evaluation of 22 representative models, including frontier models like GPT-5.1 and Qwen3-Max, reveals significant performance heterogeneities and highlights persistent bottlenecks in specific dimensions. Further analysis based on human cognitive patterns suggests potential divergences between LLM and human cognitive structures. CogToM offers a robust instrument and perspective for investigating the evolving cognitive boundaries of LLMs.

Abstract: Healthcare organizations are beginning to embed agentic AI into routine workflows, including clinical documentation support and early-warning monitoring. As these capabilities diffuse across departments and vendors, health systems face agent sprawl, causing duplicated agents, unclear accountability, inconsistent controls, and tool permissions that persist beyond the original use case. Existing AI governance frameworks emphasize lifecycle risk management but provide limited guidance for the day-to-day operations of agent fleets. We propose a Unified Agent Lifecycle Management (UALM) blueprint derived from a rapid, practice-oriented synthesis of governance standards, agent security literature, and healthcare compliance requirements. UALM maps recurring gaps onto five control-plane layers: (1) an identity and persona registry, (2) orchestration and cross-domain mediation, (3) PHI-bounded context and memory, (4) runtime policy enforcement with kill-switch triggers, and (5) lifecycle management and decommissioning linked to credential revocation and audit logging. A companion maturity model supports staged adoption. UALM offers healthcare CIOs, CISOs, and clinical leaders an implementable pattern for audit-ready oversight that preserves local innovation and enables safer scaling across clinical and administrative domains.

Abstract: Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) -- generations that are plausible but factually unfaithful -- remain a critical barrier to high-stakes deployment. Current detection methods typically rely on computationally expensive external retrieval loops or opaque black-box LLM judges requiring 70B+ parameters. In this work, we introduce [Model Name], a hybrid detection framework that combines neuroscience-inspired signal design with supervised machine learning. We extract interpretable signals grounded in Predictive Coding (quantifying surprise against internal priors) and the Information Bottleneck (measuring signal retention under perturbation). Through systematic ablation, we demonstrate three key enhancements: Entity-Focused Uptake (concentrating on high-value tokens), Context Adherence (measuring grounding strength), and Falsifiability Score (detecting confident but contradictory claims).
  Evaluating on HaluBench (n=200, perfectly balanced), our theory-guided baseline achieves 0.8017 AUROC. BASE supervised models reach 0.8274 AUROC, while IMPROVED features boost performance to 0.8669 AUROC (4.95% gain), demonstrating consistent improvements across architectures. This competitive performance is achieved while using 75x less training data than Lynx (200 vs 15,000 samples), 1000x faster inference (5ms vs 5s), and remaining fully interpretable. Crucially, we report a negative result: the Rationalization signal fails to distinguish hallucinations, suggesting that LLMs generate coherent reasoning for false premises ("Sycophancy").
  This work demonstrates that domain knowledge encoded in signal architecture provides superior data efficiency compared to scaling LLM judges, achieving strong performance with lightweight (less than 1M parameter), explainable models suitable for production deployment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然在能力上取得了显著进展，但其不可靠性仍然是高风险领域部署的关键障碍。为了构建可扩展、可靠和可信赖的下一代AI系统，需要将不确定性从被动指标转变为主动控制机制。

Method: 通过调查分析，将不确定性作为主动控制信号应用于三个前沿领域：1) 高级推理中优化计算和触发自我校正；2) 自主智能体中管理工具使用和信息寻求的元认知决策；3) 强化学习中缓解奖励攻击并通过内在奖励实现自我改进。这些方法基于贝叶斯方法和符合性预测等新兴理论框架。

Result: 展示了不确定性作为主动控制信号如何在多个关键领域提升LLMs的可靠性：在推理中实现更有效的计算分配，在智能体中改善决策过程，在强化学习中防止奖励博弈。这些方法共同推动构建更加可靠和可信的AI系统。

Conclusion: 掌握不确定性作为主动控制信号的新趋势对于构建下一代可扩展、可靠和可信赖的AI至关重要。调查提供了全面的综述、批判性分析和实用设计模式，为这一变革性趋势提供了统一的视角。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable capabilities, their unreliability remains a critical barrier to deployment in high-stakes domains. This survey charts a functional evolution in addressing this challenge: the evolution of uncertainty from a passive diagnostic metric to an active control signal guiding real-time model behavior. We demonstrate how uncertainty is leveraged as an active control signal across three frontiers: in \textbf{advanced reasoning} to optimize computation and trigger self-correction; in \textbf{autonomous agents} to govern metacognitive decisions about tool use and information seeking; and in \textbf{reinforcement learning} to mitigate reward hacking and enable self-improvement via intrinsic rewards. By grounding these advancements in emerging theoretical frameworks like Bayesian methods and Conformal Prediction, we provide a unified perspective on this transformative trend. This survey provides a comprehensive overview, critical analysis, and practical design patterns, arguing that mastering the new trend of uncertainty is essential for building the next generation of scalable, reliable, and trustworthy AI.

Conclusion: 这是建立先进AI系统多语言安全测试共享框架的初步尝试，呼吁与更广泛研究社区和行业继续合作。

Abstract: As frontier AI models are deployed globally, it is essential that their behaviour remains safe and reliable across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. To examine how current model safeguards hold up in such settings, participants from the International Network for Advanced AI Measurement, Evaluation and Science, including representatives from Singapore, Japan, Australia, Canada, the EU, France, Kenya, South Korea and the UK conducted a joint multilingual evaluation exercise. Led by Singapore AISI, two open-weight models were tested across ten languages spanning high and low resourced groups: Cantonese English, Farsi, French, Japanese, Korean, Kiswahili, Malay, Mandarin Chinese and Telugu. Over 6,000 newly translated prompts were evaluated across five harm categories (privacy, non-violent crime, violent crime, intellectual property and jailbreak robustness), using both LLM-as-a-judge and human annotation.
  The exercise shows how safety behaviours can vary across languages. These include differences in safeguard robustness across languages and harm types and variation in evaluator reliability (LLM-as-judge vs. human review). Further, it also generated methodological insights for improving multilingual safety evaluations, such as the need for culturally contextualised translations, stress-tested evaluator prompts and clearer human annotation guidelines. This work represents an initial step toward a shared framework for multilingual safety testing of advanced AI systems and calls for continued collaboration with the wider research community and industry.

Abstract: While Text-to-SQL remains the dominant approach for database interaction, real-world analytics increasingly require the flexibility of general-purpose programming languages such as Python or Pandas to manage file-based data and complex analytical workflows. Despite this growing need, the reliability of Text-to-Python in core data retrieval remains underexplored relative to the mature SQL ecosystem. To address this gap, we introduce BIRD-Python, a benchmark designed for cross-paradigm evaluation. We systematically refined the original dataset to reduce annotation noise and align execution semantics, thereby establishing a consistent and standardized baseline for comparison. Our analysis reveals a fundamental paradigmatic divergence: whereas SQL leverages implicit DBMS behaviors through its declarative structure, Python requires explicit procedural logic, making it highly sensitive to underspecified user intent. To mitigate this challenge, we propose the Logic Completion Framework (LCF), which resolves ambiguity by incorporating latent domain knowledge into the generation process. Experimental results show that (1) performance differences primarily stem from missing domain context rather than inherent limitations in code generation, and (2) when these gaps are addressed, Text-to-Python achieves performance parity with Text-to-SQL. These findings establish Python as a viable foundation for analytical agents-provided that systems effectively ground ambiguous natural language inputs in executable logical specifications.

Abstract: The combination of verifiable languages and LLMs has significantly influenced both the mathematical and computer science communities because it provides a rigorous foundation for theorem proving. Recent advancements in the field provide foundation models and sophisticated agentic systems pushing the boundaries of formal mathematical reasoning to approach the natural language capability of LLMs. However, little attention has been given to the formal physics reasoning, which also heavily relies on similar problem-solving and theorem-proving frameworks. To solve this problem, this paper presents, to the best of our knowledge, the first approach to enhance formal theorem proving in the physics domain. We compose a dedicated dataset PhysLeanData for the task. It is composed of theorems sampled from PhysLean and data generated by a conjecture-based formal data generation pipeline. In the training pipeline, we leverage DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B, a strong open-source mathematical theorem prover, and apply Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to train our model PhysProver. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that, using only $\sim$5K training samples, PhysProver achieves an overall 2.4\% improvement in multiple sub-domains. Furthermore, after formal physics training, we observe 1.3\% gains on the MiniF2F-Test benchmark, which indicates non-trivial generalization beyond physics domains and enhancement for formal math capability as well. The results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, which provides a paradigm for extending formal provers outside mathematical domains. To foster further research, we will release both our dataset and model to the community.

Abstract: Tabular data is a fundamental form of data structure. The evolution of table analysis tools reflects humanity's continuous progress in data acquisition, management, and processing. The dynamic changes in table columns arise from technological advancements, changing needs, data integration, etc. However, the standard process of training AI models on tables with fixed columns and then performing inference is not suitable for handling dynamically changed tables. Therefore, new methods are needed for efficiently handling such tables in an unsupervised manner. In this paper, we introduce a new task, Tabular Incremental Inference (TabII), which aims to enable trained models to incorporate new columns during the inference stage, enhancing the practicality of AI models in scenarios where tables are dynamically changed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this new task can be framed as an optimization problem based on the information bottleneck theory, which emphasizes that the key to an ideal tabular incremental inference approach lies in minimizing mutual information between tabular data and representation while maximizing between representation and task labels. Under this guidance, we design a TabII method with Large Language Model placeholders and Pretrained TabAdapter to provide external knowledge and Incremental Sample Condensation blocks to condense the task-relevant information given by incremental column attributes. Experimental results across eight public datasets show that TabII effectively utilizes incremental attributes, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Method: 提出SigEnt-SAC off-policy actor-critic方法，使用sigmoid有界熵项防止负熵驱动的优化偏离分布动作，减少Q函数振荡，仅需单条专家轨迹。

Result: 在D4RL基准上显著减轻Q函数振荡，更快达到100%成功率；在四个真实机器人任务中，仅需少量真实交互就能从原始图像和稀疏奖励中学习成功策略。

Conclusion: SigEnt-SAC为现实世界RL部署提供了一条低成本、实用的途径，仅需少量数据和最小交互就能学习有效策略。

Abstract: Deploying reinforcement learning in the real world remains challenging due to sample inefficiency, sparse rewards, and noisy visual observations. Prior work leverages demonstrations and human feedback to improve learning efficiency and robustness. However, offline-to-online methods need large datasets and can be unstable, while VLA-assisted RL relies on large-scale pretraining and fine-tuning. As a result, a low-cost real-world RL method with minimal data requirements has yet to emerge. We introduce \textbf{SigEnt-SAC}, an off-policy actor-critic method that learns from scratch using a single expert trajectory. Our key design is a sigmoid-bounded entropy term that prevents negative-entropy-driven optimization toward out-of-distribution actions and reduces Q-function oscillations. We benchmark SigEnt-SAC on D4RL tasks against representative baselines. Experiments show that SigEnt-SAC substantially alleviates Q-function oscillations and reaches a 100\% success rate faster than prior methods. Finally, we validate SigEnt-SAC on four real-world robotic tasks across multiple embodiments, where agents learn from raw images and sparse rewards; results demonstrate that SigEnt-SAC can learn successful policies with only a small number of real-world interactions, suggesting a low-cost and practical pathway for real-world RL deployment.

Abstract: AI agents are rapidly advancing from passive language models to autonomous systems executing complex, multi-step tasks. Yet their overconfidence in failure remains a fundamental barrier to deployment in high-stakes settings. Existing calibration methods, built for static single-turn outputs, cannot address the unique challenges of agentic systems, such as compounding errors along trajectories, uncertainty from external tools, and opaque failure modes. To address these challenges, we introduce, for the first time, the problem of Agentic Confidence Calibration and propose Holistic Trajectory Calibration (HTC), a novel diagnostic framework that extracts rich process-level features ranging from macro dynamics to micro stability across an agent's entire trajectory. Powered by a simple, interpretable model, HTC consistently surpasses strong baselines in both calibration and discrimination, across eight benchmarks, multiple LLMs, and diverse agent frameworks. Beyond performance, HTC delivers three essential advances: it provides interpretability by revealing the signals behind failure, enables transferability by applying across domains without retraining, and achieves generalization through a General Agent Calibrator (GAC) that achieves the best calibration (lowest ECE) on the out-of-domain GAIA benchmark. Together, these contributions establish a new process-centric paradigm for confidence calibration, providing a framework for diagnosing and enhancing the reliability of AI agents.

Abstract: Many theorists of creativity maintain that intentional agency is a necessary condition of creativity. We argue that this requirement, which we call the Intentional Agency Condition (IAC), should be rejected as a general condition of creativity, while retaining its relevance in specific contexts. We show that recent advances in generative AI have rendered the IAC increasingly problematic, both descriptively and functionally. We offer two reasons for abandoning it at the general level. First, we present corpus evidence indicating that authors and journalists are increasingly comfortable ascribing creativity to generative AI, despite its lack of intentional agency. This development places pressure on the linguistic intuitions that have traditionally been taken to support the IAC. Second, drawing on the method of conceptual engineering, we argue that the IAC no longer fulfils its core social function. Rather than facilitating the identification and encouragement of reliable sources of novel and valuable products, it now feeds into biases that distort our assessments of AI-generated outputs. We therefore propose replacing the IAC with a consistency requirement, according to which creativity tracks the reliable generation of novel and valuable products. Nonetheless, we explain why the IAC should be retained in specific local domains.

Abstract: Recent advances in Deep Research Agents (DRAs) are transforming automated knowledge discovery and problem-solving. While the majority of existing efforts focus on enhancing policy capabilities via post-training, we propose an alternative paradigm: self-evolving the agent's ability by iteratively verifying the policy model's outputs, guided by meticulously crafted rubrics. This approach gives rise to the inference-time scaling of verification, wherein an agent self-improves by evaluating its generated answers to produce iterative feedback and refinements. We derive the rubrics based on an automatically constructed DRA Failure Taxonomy, which systematically classifies agent failures into five major categories and thirteen sub-categories. We present DeepVerifier, a rubrics-based outcome reward verifier that leverages the asymmetry of verification and outperforms vanilla agent-as-judge and LLM judge baselines by 12%-48% in meta-evaluation F1 score. To enable practical self-evolution, DeepVerifier integrates as a plug-and-play module during test-time inference. The verifier produces detailed rubric-based feedback, which is fed back to the agent for iterative bootstrapping, refining responses without additional training. This test-time scaling delivers 8%-11% accuracy gains on challenging subsets of GAIA and XBench-DeepResearch when powered by capable closed-source LLMs. Finally, to support open-source advancement, we release DeepVerifier-4K, a curated supervised fine-tuning dataset of 4,646 high-quality agent steps focused on DRA verification. These examples emphasize reflection and self-critique, enabling open models to develop robust verification capabilities.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLM) benchmarks tell us when models fail, but not why they fail. A wrong answer on a reasoning dataset may stem from formatting issues, calculation errors, or dataset noise rather than weak reasoning. Without disentangling such causes, benchmarks remain incomplete and cannot reliably guide model improvement. We introduce ErrorMap, the first method to chart the sources of LLM failure. It extracts a model's unique "failure signature", clarifies what benchmarks measure, and broadens error identification to reduce blind spots. This helps developers debug models, aligns benchmark goals with outcomes, and supports informed model selection. ErrorMap works on any model or dataset with the same logic. Applying our method to 35 datasets and 83 models we generate ErrorAtlas, a taxonomy of model errors, revealing recurring failure patterns. ErrorAtlas highlights error types that are currently underexplored in LLM research, such as omissions of required details in the output and question misinterpretation. By shifting focus from where models succeed to why they fail, ErrorMap and ErrorAtlas enable advanced evaluation - one that exposes hidden weaknesses and directs progress. Unlike success, typically measured by task-level metrics, our approach introduces a deeper evaluation layer that can be applied globally across models and tasks, offering richer insights into model behavior and limitations. We make the taxonomy and code publicly available with plans to periodically update ErrorAtlas as new benchmarks and models emerge.

Abstract: Text-Based Person Search (TBPS) holds unique value in real-world surveillance bridging visual perception and language understanding, yet current paradigms utilizing pre-training models often fail to transfer effectively to complex open-world scenarios. The reliance on "Passive Observation" leads to multifaceted spurious correlations and spatial semantic misalignment, causing a lack of robustness against distribution shifts. To fundamentally resolve these defects, this paper proposes ICON (Invariant Counterfactual Optimization with Neuro-symbolic priors), a framework integrating causal and topological priors. First, we introduce Rule-Guided Spatial Intervention to strictly penalize sensitivity to bounding box noise, forcibly severing location shortcuts to achieve geometric invariance. Second, Counterfactual Context Disentanglement is implemented via semantic-driven background transplantation, compelling the model to ignore background interference for environmental independence. Then, we employ Saliency-Driven Semantic Regularization with adaptive masking to resolve local saliency bias and guarantee holistic completeness. Finally, Neuro-Symbolic Topological Alignment utilizes neuro-symbolic priors to constrain feature matching, ensuring activated regions are topologically consistent with human structural logic. Experimental results demonstrate that ICON not only maintains leading performance on standard benchmarks but also exhibits exceptional robustness against occlusion, background interference, and localization noise. This approach effectively advances the field by shifting from fitting statistical co-occurrences to learning causal invariance.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Planetary surfaces are typically analyzed using high-level semantic concepts in natural language, yet vast orbital image archives remain organized at the pixel level. This mismatch limits scalable, open-ended exploration of planetary surfaces. Here we present MarScope, a planetary-scale vision-language framework enabling natural language-driven, label-free mapping of Martian landforms. MarScope aligns planetary images and text in a shared semantic space, trained on over 200,000 curated image-text pairs. This framework transforms global geomorphic mapping on Mars by replacing pre-defined classifications with flexible semantic retrieval, enabling arbitrary user queries across the entire planet in 5 seconds with F1 scores up to 0.978. Applications further show that it extends beyond morphological classification to facilitate process-oriented analysis and similarity-based geomorphological mapping at a planetary scale. MarScope establishes a new paradigm where natural language serves as a direct interface for scientific discovery over massive geospatial datasets.

Abstract: The Decision Transformer (DT) has established a powerful sequence modeling approach to offline reinforcement learning. It conditions its action predictions on Return-to-Go (RTG), using it both to distinguish trajectory quality during training and to guide action generation at inference. In this work, we identify a critical redundancy in this design: feeding the entire sequence of RTGs into the Transformer is theoretically unnecessary, as only the most recent RTG affects action prediction. We show that this redundancy can impair DT's performance through experiments. To resolve this, we propose the Decoupled DT (DDT). DDT simplifies the architecture by processing only observation and action sequences through the Transformer, using the latest RTG to guide the action prediction. This streamlined approach not only improves performance but also reduces computational cost. Our experiments show that DDT significantly outperforms DT and establishes competitive performance against state-of-the-art DT variants across multiple offline RL tasks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The rise of live streaming has transformed online interaction, enabling massive real-time engagement but also exposing platforms to complex risks such as scams and coordinated malicious behaviors. Detecting these risks is challenging because harmful actions often accumulate gradually and recur across seemingly unrelated streams. To address this, we propose CS-VAR (Cross-Session Evidence-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Detector) for live streaming risk assessment. In CS-VAR, a lightweight, domain-specific model performs fast session-level risk inference, guided during training by a Large Language Model (LLM) that reasons over retrieved cross-session behavioral evidence and transfers its local-to-global insights to the small model. This design enables the small model to recognize recurring patterns across streams, perform structured risk assessment, and maintain efficiency for real-time deployment. Extensive offline experiments on large-scale industrial datasets, combined with online validation, demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CS-VAR. Furthermore, CS-VAR provides interpretable, localized signals that effectively empower real-world moderation for live streaming.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can aid synthesis planning in chemistry, but standard prompting methods often yield hallucinated or outdated suggestions. We study LLM interactions with a reaction knowledge graph by casting reaction path retrieval as a Text2Cypher (natural language to graph query) generation problem, and define single- and multi-step retrieval tasks. We compare zero-shot prompting to one-shot variants using static, random, and embedding-based exemplar selection, and assess a checklist-driven validator/corrector loop. To evaluate our framework, we consider query validity and retrieval accuracy. We find that one-shot prompting with aligned exemplars consistently performs best. Our checklist-style self-correction loop mainly improves executability in zero-shot settings and offers limited additional retrieval gains once a good exemplar is present. We provide a reproducible Text2Cypher evaluation setup to facilitate further work on KG-grounded LLMs for synthesis planning. Code is available at https://github.com/Intelligent-molecular-systems/KG-LLM-Synthesis-Retrieval.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Designing faster algorithms for solving Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems is highly desired across numerous practical domains, as a vast array of complex real-world challenges can be effectively modeled as MILP formulations. Solving these problems typically employs the branch-and-bound algorithm, the core of which can be conceived as searching for a path of nodes (or sub-problems) that contains the optimal solution to the original MILP problem. Traditional approaches to finding this path rely heavily on hand-crafted, intuition-based heuristic strategies, which often suffer from unstable and unpredictable performance across different MILP problem instances. To address this limitation, we introduce DeepBound, a deep learning-based node selection algorithm that automates the learning of such human intuition from data. The core of DeepBound lies in learning to prioritize nodes containing the optimal solution, thereby improving solving efficiency. DeepBound introduces a multi-level feature fusion network to capture the node representations. To tackle the inherent node imbalance in branch-and-bound trees, DeepBound employs a pairwise training paradigm that enhances the model's ability to discriminate between nodes. Extensive experiments on three NP-hard MILP benchmarks demonstrate that DeepBound achieves superior solving efficiency over conventional heuristic rules and existing learning-based approaches, obtaining optimal feasible solutions with significantly reduced computation time. Moreover, DeepBound demonstrates strong generalization capability on large and complex instances. The analysis of its learned features reveals that the method can automatically discover more flexible and robust feature selection, which may effectively improve and potentially replace human-designed heuristic rules.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索长期对话中显式情感动力学对LLM智能体行为的影响，解决现有方法在时序一致性与可控恢复方面的不足。

Method: 引入外部情感子系统，基于Valence-Arousal-Dominance（VAD）状态，通过一阶/二阶动力学规则进行状态更新，并将情感状态注入生成过程（不修改模型参数）。

Result: 无状态智能体缺乏连贯轨迹与恢复能力；二阶动力学引入的情感惯性与滞后现象稳定了状态但降低了响应性，一阶动态则可在保持响应的同时实现可靠恢复。

Conclusion: 外显情感动力学结构有潜力提升LLM智能体的长期交互一致性；一阶动态的平衡性更佳，而二阶动态的稳态效果需权衡稳定性与响应性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents often exhibit abrupt shifts in tone and persona during extended interaction, reflecting the absence of explicit temporal structure governing agent-level state. While prior work emphasizes turn-local sentiment or static emotion classification, the role of explicit affective dynamics in shaping long-horizon agent behavior remains underexplored. This work investigates whether imposing dynamical structure on an external affective state can induce temporal coherence and controlled recovery in multi-turn dialogue. We introduce an agent-level affective subsystem that maintains a continuous Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) state external to the language model and governed by first- and second-order update rules. Instantaneous affective signals are extracted using a fixed, memoryless estimator and integrated over time via exponential smoothing or momentum-based dynamics. The resulting affective state is injected back into generation without modifying model parameters. Using a fixed 25-turn dialogue protocol, we compare stateless, first-order, and second-order affective dynamics. Stateless agents fail to exhibit coherent trajectories or recovery, while state persistence enables delayed responses and reliable recovery. Second-order dynamics introduce affective inertia and hysteresis that increase with momentum, revealing a trade-off between stability and responsiveness.

Motivation: 气候虚假信息在社交媒体上广泛传播，特别是具有误导性的图像和视频，这些内容难以检测且可能阻碍气候行动。现有视觉语言模型仅依赖训练时的知识，无法有效处理涉及近期事件或更新的虚假信息。

Method: 通过从外部来源检索最新信息（如反向图像搜索结果、在线事实核查、可信专家内容等），将视觉语言模型与实时知识结合，系统化评估图像及其声明的准确性、误导性、虚假性或无法验证性。

Conclusion: 结合外部知识检索的视觉语言模型能显著提升对气候虚假信息的检测效果，有助于在快速变化的信息环境中维护科学理解，为应对数字时代的虚假信息挑战提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Climate disinformation has become a major challenge in today digital world, especially with the rise of misleading images and videos shared widely on social media. These false claims are often convincing and difficult to detect, which can delay actions on climate change. While vision-language models (VLMs) have been used to identify visual disinformation, they rely only on the knowledge available at the time of training. This limits their ability to reason about recent events or updates. The main goal of this paper is to overcome that limitation by combining VLMs with external knowledge. By retrieving up-to-date information such as reverse image results, online fact-checks, and trusted expert content, the system can better assess whether an image and its claim are accurate, misleading, false, or unverifiable. This approach improves the model ability to handle real-world climate disinformation and supports efforts to protect public understanding of science in a rapidly changing information landscape.

Motivation: 随着LLM在教育应用中的普及，需要基于证据的方法来设计和评估能够产生个性化、教学对齐输出的LLM提示。

Method: 设计了六种包含不同教学策略的提示模板，采用锦标赛式的评估框架，使用Glicko2评分系统，由八位评委在格式、对话支持、学习者适用性三个维度上评估来自三个教育部署的120个真实用户交互生成的问题对。

Conclusion: 该方法论展示了教育技术研究者如何系统评估和改进提示设计，推动教育应用从临时性提示工程转向基于证据的提示开发。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly common in educational applications, there is a growing need for evidence-based methods to design and evaluate LLM prompts that produce personalized and pedagogically aligned out-puts. This study presents a generalizable, systematic approach for evaluating prompts, demonstrated through an analysis of LLM-generated follow-up questions in a structured dialogue activity. Six prompt templates were designed and tested. The templates incorporated established prompt engineering patterns, with each prompt emphasizing distinct pedagogical strategies. The prompt templates were compared through a tournament-style evaluation framework that can be adapted for other educational applications. The tournament employed the Glicko2 rating system with eight judges evaluating question pairs across three dimensions: format, dialogue support, and appropriateness for learners. Data was sourced from 120 authentic user interactions across three distinct educational deployments. Results showed that a single prompt related to strategic reading out-performed other templates with win probabilities ranging from 81% to 100% in pairwise comparisons. This prompt combined persona and context manager pat-terns and was designed to support metacognitive learning strategies such as self-directed learning. The methodology showcases how educational technology re- searchers can systematically evaluate and improve prompt designs, moving beyond ad-hoc prompt engineering toward evidence-based prompt development for educational applications.

Motivation: 大型语言模型与强化学习结合的最先进神经定理证明器（如DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5）经过复杂训练已取得优异成绩。本研究旨在探究这些高度训练的模型在推理时是否仍能受益于简单的结构指导。

Method: 在miniF2F基准测试上评估一种轻量级干预——对15种常见战术骨架使用固定的提示调度方法。相比标准采样方法，该方法在相同样本数量（k=16）和相同最大生成长度（1024个token）下进行评估。

Result: 该方法在pass@16指标上达到21.7%，而相同模型的标准采样方法仅为15.2%，相对提升43%。

Conclusion: 即使经过强化学习训练的高能力证明器也未能充分利用战术语言中的结构先验，简单的推理时指导仍能作为一种廉价且互补的提升手段。

Abstract: State-of-the-art neural theorem provers like DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5 combine large language models with reinforcement learning, achieving impressive results through sophisticated training. We ask: do these highly-trained models still benefit from simple structural guidance at inference time? We evaluate a lightweight intervention -- a fixed prompt schedule over 15 common tactic skeletons -- on the miniF2F benchmark. This simple approach yields 21.7% pass@16 compared to 15.2% for standard sampling from the same model, a 43% relative improvement using the same number of samples (k=16) and same maximum generation length (1024 tokens). Our results suggest that even capable RL-trained provers underutilize structural priors available in the tactic language, and that simple inference-time guidance remains a cheap, complementary boost.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess strong representation and reasoning capabilities, but their application to structure-based drug design (SBDD) is limited by insufficient understanding of protein structures and unpredictable molecular generation. To address these challenges, we propose Exploration-Augmented Latent Inference for LLMs (ELILLM), a framework that reinterprets the LLM generation process as an encoding, latent space exploration, and decoding workflow. ELILLM explicitly explores portions of the design problem beyond the model's current knowledge while using a decoding module to handle familiar regions, generating chemically valid and synthetically reasonable molecules. In our implementation, Bayesian optimization guides the systematic exploration of latent embeddings, and a position-aware surrogate model efficiently predicts binding affinity distributions to inform the search. Knowledge-guided decoding further reduces randomness and effectively imposes chemical validity constraints. We demonstrate ELILLM on the CrossDocked2020 benchmark, showing strong controlled exploration and high binding affinity scores compared with seven baseline methods. These results demonstrate that ELILLM can effectively enhance LLMs capabilities for SBDD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户不应因使用的语言而受到系统性歧视，跨语言用户应能获得同等质量的AI响应。当前需要验证LLMs是否存在语言偏见，以及语言如何与文化和上下文交互影响回答质量。

Method: 基于WildChat数据集构建真实世界开放性问题集；使用LLM-as-Judge方法识别回答中的文化背景；通过翻译CulturalBench基准在多种语言上进行跨文化评估。

Result: LLMs在低资源语言上的开放性问题回答质量显著较低；语言选择显著影响模型使用的文化背景信息；文化背景差异影响下游回答质量。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs存在明显的语言不平等问题，低资源语言用户获得的信息质量较差。语言与文化背景紧密交织，需要系统性方法来减少这种偏见，确保语言公平性。

Abstract: Users should not be systemically disadvantaged by the language they use for interacting with LLMs; i.e. users across languages should get responses of similar quality irrespective of language used. In this work, we create a set of real-world open-ended questions based on our analysis of the WildChat dataset and use it to evaluate whether responses vary by language, specifically, whether answer quality depends on the language used to query the model. We also investigate how language and culture are entangled in LLMs such that choice of language changes the cultural information and context used in the response by using LLM-as-a-Judge to identify the cultural context present in responses. To further investigate this, we evaluate LLMs on a translated subset of the CulturalBench benchmark across multiple languages. Our evaluations reveal that LLMs consistently provide lower quality answers to open-ended questions in low resource languages. We find that language significantly impacts the cultural context used by the model. This difference in context impacts the quality of the downstream answer.

TL;DR: 提出了零计算专家（null expert）方法，在保持因果性的同时实现数据稀疏性，提高混合专家层的计算效率，特别适用于视觉-语言模型训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合专家层通过权重稀疏性实现计算效率，但数据稀疏性（每个专家只处理部分token）提供了互补的优势。现有的专家选择路由虽能直接实现数据稀疏性，但在自回归模型中违反因果性，造成训练-推理不匹配。本文旨在恢复因果性token选择MoE中的数据稀疏性。

Method: 在路由池中引入零计算（null）专家。当token路由到null专家时，这些槽位不消耗计算。通过标准的负载平衡目标训练模型均衡地使用所有专家（包括null专家），从而在期望上实现数据稀疏性，同时避免因果性违反。特别适用于视觉-语言模型训练，因为视觉编码器产生许多低信息token而文本token更密集。

Result: 在匹配的预期FLOPs下，结合权重稀疏性和数据稀疏性比仅使用权重稀疏性产生更高效的计算边界，训练损失和下游性能均有提升。模型学习到隐式的模态感知分配，与文本token相比，视觉token更积极地路由到null专家，无需显式的模态路由。

Conclusion: 通过引入null专家，在保持因果性的token选择MoE中实现了数据稀疏性，显著提高了视觉-语言模型训练的计算效率，同时提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts layers achieve compute efficiency through weight sparsity: each token activates only a subset of experts. Data sparsity, where each expert processes only a subset of tokens, offers a complementary axis. Expert-choice routing implements data sparsity directly but violates causality in autoregressive models, creating train-inference mismatch. We recover data sparsity within causal token-choice MoE by leveraging zero-compute (null) experts within the routing pool. When a token routes to null experts, those slots consume no compute. The standard load balancing objective trains the model to uniformly use all experts (real and null) therefore creating data sparsity in expectation without the causality violations. We evaluate on vision-language model training, where data heterogeneity is pronounced: vision encoders produce many low-information tokens while text tokens are denser. At matched expected FLOPs, composing weight and data sparsity yields a more compute-efficient frontier than weight sparsity alone, with gains in training loss and downstream performance. The model learns implicit modality-aware allocation, routing vision tokens to null experts more aggressively than text, without explicit modality routing.

Conclusion: GOAT为注意力机制提供了新的理论视角和实用框架，通过可学习先验增强了注意力机制的表达能力和泛化性能。

Abstract: We generalize the attention mechanism by viewing it through the lens of Entropic Optimal Transport, revealing that standard attention corresponds to a transport problem regularized by an implicit uniform prior. We introduce Generalized Optimal transport Attention with Trainable priors (GOAT), a new attention mechanism that replaces this naive assumption with a learnable, continuous prior. This prior maintains full compatibility with optimized kernels such as FlashAttention. GOAT also provides an EOT-based explanation of attention sinks and materializes a solution for them, avoiding the representational trade-offs of standard attention. Finally, by absorbing spatial information into the core attention computation, GOAT learns an extrapolatable prior that combines the flexibility of learned positional embeddings with the length generalization of fixed encodings.

Abstract: High-Performance Computing (HPC) schedulers must balance user performance with facility-wide resource constraints. The task boils down to selecting the optimal number of nodes for a given job. We present a surrogate-assisted multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) framework to automate this complex decision. Our core hypothesis is that surrogate models informed by attention-based embeddings of job telemetry can capture performance dynamics more effectively than standard regression techniques. We pair this with an intelligent sample acquisition strategy to ensure the approach is data-efficient. On two production HPC datasets, our embedding-informed method consistently identified higher-quality Pareto fronts of runtime-power trade-offs compared to baselines. Furthermore, our intelligent data sampling strategy drastically reduced training costs while improving the stability of the results. To our knowledge, this is the first work to successfully apply embedding-informed surrogates in a MOBO framework to the HPC scheduling problem, jointly optimizing for performance and power on production workloads.

Motivation: 现代数据集包含质量差异较大的样本，直接在异构数据上训练扩散模型往往导致次优结果，需要一种方法能系统性提升数据集质量以优化模型学习。

Method: 提出数据集-模型协同进化过程：每轮迭代中，将合成改进的样本视为噪声数据（噪声水平逐轮递减），利用 Ambient Diffusion 技术在数据损坏下学习，逐步提升数据集和模型质量，避免破坏性自消耗循环。

Result: 该框架在无条件和文本条件图像生成以及蛋白质设计任务中取得最先进性能，并为循环过程提供了理论依据。

Conclusion: Ambient Dataloops 通过迭代精炼数据集的协同进化机制，能有效提升扩散模型对基础数据分布的学习能力，是一种有理论支撑的实用框架。

Abstract: We propose Ambient Dataloops, an iterative framework for refining datasets that makes it easier for diffusion models to learn the underlying data distribution. Modern datasets contain samples of highly varying quality, and training directly on such heterogeneous data often yields suboptimal models. We propose a dataset-model co-evolution process; at each iteration of our method, the dataset becomes progressively higher quality, and the model improves accordingly. To avoid destructive self-consuming loops, at each generation, we treat the synthetically improved samples as noisy, but at a slightly lower noisy level than the previous iteration, and we use Ambient Diffusion techniques for learning under corruption. Empirically, Ambient Dataloops achieve state-of-the-art performance in unconditional and text-conditional image generation and de novo protein design. We further provide a theoretical justification for the proposed framework that captures the benefits of the data looping procedure.

Abstract: Internal activations of diffusion models encode rich semantic information, but interpreting such representations remains challenging. While Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have shown promise in disentangling latent representations, existing SAE-based methods for diffusion model understanding rely on unsupervised approaches that fail to align sparse features with human-understandable concepts. This limits their ability to provide reliable semantic control over generated images. We introduce CASL (Concept-Aligned Sparse Latents), a supervised framework that aligns sparse latent dimensions of diffusion models with semantic concepts. CASL first trains an SAE on frozen U-Net activations to obtain disentangled latent representations, and then learns a lightweight linear mapping that associates each concept with a small set of relevant latent dimensions. To validate the semantic meaning of these aligned directions, we propose CASL-Steer, a controlled latent intervention that shifts activations along the learned concept axis. Unlike editing methods, CASL-Steer is used solely as a causal probe to reveal how concept-aligned latents influence generated content. We further introduce the Editing Precision Ratio (EPR), a metric that jointly measures concept specificity and the preservation of unrelated attributes. Experiments show that our method achieves superior editing precision and interpretability compared to existing approaches. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to achieve supervised alignment between latent representations and semantic concepts in diffusion models.

Abstract: The prevalence and low cost of LLMs have led to a rise of synthetic content. From review sites to court documents, ``natural'' content has been contaminated by data points that appear similar to natural data, but are in fact LLM-generated. In this work we revisit fundamental learning theory questions in this, now ubiquitous, setting. We model this scenario as a sequence of learning tasks where the input is a mix of natural and synthetic data, and the learning algorithms are oblivious to the origin of any individual example.
  We study the possibilities and limitations of ERM in this setting. For the problem of estimating the mean of an arbitrary $d$-dimensional distribution, we find that while ERM converges to the true mean, it is outperformed by an algorithm that assigns non-uniform weights to examples from different generations of data. For the PAC learning setting, the disparity is even more stark. We find that ERM does not always converge to the true concept, echoing the model collapse literature. However, we show there are algorithms capable of learning the correct hypothesis for arbitrary VC classes and arbitrary amounts of contamination.

Motivation: 现代深度学习训练受GPU内存和计算限制，RandNLA虽有压缩技术但缺乏统一生产级库阻碍其广泛应用

Method: 开发Panther库，集成RandNLA算法，提供线性层、卷积、注意力等组件的高效替代，通过C++/CUDA后端优化CPU/GPU性能

Result: BERT中替换PyTorch标准层后，仅需几行代码即可实现高达75%内存节省，同时保持可比性能

Conclusion: Panther有效整合RandNLA技术，易于采用，为深度学习提供实用的模型压缩解决方案

Abstract: Training modern deep learning models is increasingly constrained by GPU memory and compute limits. While Randomized Numerical Linear Algebra (RandNLA) offers proven techniques to compress these models, the lack of a unified, production-grade library prevents widely adopting these methods. We present Panther, a PyTorch-compatible library that consolidates established RandNLA algorithms into a single high-performance framework. Panther engineers efficient, drop-in replacements for standard components including sketched linear layers, 2D convolution, multi-head attention, and randomized matrix decompositions (such as pivoted CholeskyQR). By implementing a custom C++/CUDA backend (pawX), Panther provides an optimized implementation that can run on both CPUs and GPUs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RandNLA techniques and Panther's ease of adoption. By replacing standard PyTorch linear layers with Panther layers (requiring only a few lines of code) we achieve significant memory savings (up to 75%) on BERT while maintaining comparable loss.

Abstract: Graph neural network (GNN) have demonstrated exceptional performance in solving critical problems across diverse domains yet remain susceptible to backdoor attacks. Existing studies on backdoor attack for graph classification are limited to single target attack using subgraph replacement based mechanism where the attacker implants only one trigger into the GNN model. In this paper, we introduce the first multi-targeted backdoor attack for graph classification task, where multiple triggers simultaneously redirect predictions to different target labels. Instead of subgraph replacement, we propose subgraph injection which preserves the structure of the original graphs while poisoning the clean graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, where our attack achieves high attack success rates for all target labels with minimal impact on the clean accuracy. Experimental results on five dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our attack framework compared to the conventional subgraph replacement-based attack. Our analysis on four GNN models confirms the generalization capability of our attack which is effective regardless of the GNN model architectures and training parameters settings. We further investigate the impact of the attack design parameters including injection methods, number of connections, trigger sizes, trigger edge density and poisoning ratios. Additionally, our evaluation against state-of-the-art defenses (randomized smoothing and fine-pruning) demonstrates the robustness of our proposed multi-target attacks. This work highlights the GNN vulnerability against multi-targeted backdoor attack in graph classification task.

Abstract: Emergency Department overcrowding is a critical issue that compromises patient safety and operational efficiency, necessitating accurate demand forecasting for effective resource allocation. This study evaluates and compares three distinct predictive models: Seasonal AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average with eXogenous regressors (SARIMAX), EXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for forecasting daily ED arrivals over a seven-day horizon. Utilizing data from an Australian tertiary referral hospital spanning January 2017 to December 2021, this research distinguishes itself by decomposing demand into eight specific ward categories and stratifying patients by clinical complexity. To address data distortions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the study employs the Prophet model to generate synthetic counterfactual values for the anomalous period. Experimental results demonstrate that all three proposed models consistently outperform a seasonal naive baseline. XGBoost demonstrated the highest accuracy for predicting total daily admissions with a Mean Absolute Error of 6.63, while the statistical SARIMAX model proved marginally superior for forecasting major complexity cases with an MAE of 3.77. The study concludes that while these techniques successfully reproduce regular day-to-day patterns, they share a common limitation in underestimating sudden, infrequent surges in patient volume.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Standard autoregressive decoding in large language models (LLMs) is inherently short-sighted, often failing to find globally optimal reasoning paths due to its token-by-token generation process. While inference-time strategies like foresight sampling attempt to mitigate this by simulating future steps, they typically rely on ad-hoc heuristics for valuing paths and pruning the search space. This paper introduces Martingale Foresight Sampling (MFS), a principled framework that reformulates LLM decoding as a problem of identifying an optimal stochastic process. By modeling the quality of a reasoning path as a stochastic process, we leverage Martingale theory to design a theoretically-grounded algorithm. Our approach replaces heuristic mechanisms with principles from probability theory: step valuation is derived from the Doob Decomposition Theorem to measure a path's predictable advantage, path selection uses Optional Stopping Theory for principled pruning of suboptimal candidates, and an adaptive stopping rule based on the Martingale Convergence Theorem terminates exploration once a path's quality has provably converged. Experiments on six reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MFS surpasses state-of-the-art methods in accuracy while significantly improving computational efficiency. Code will be released at https://github.com/miraclehetech/EACL2026-Martingale-Foresight-Sampling.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) accelerates autoregressive large language model (LLM) inference by decoupling generation and verification. While recent methods improve draft quality by tightly coupling the drafter with the target model, the verification mechanism itself remains largely unchanged, relying on strict token-level rejection sampling. In practice, modern LLMs frequently operate in low-margin regimes where the target model exhibits weak preference among top candidates. In such cases, rejecting plausible runner-up tokens yields negligible information gain while incurring substantial rollback cost, leading to a fundamental inefficiency in verification. We propose Margin-Aware Speculative Verification, a training-free and domain-agnostic verification strategy that adapts to the target model's local decisiveness. Our method conditions verification on decision stability measured directly from the target logits and relaxes rejection only when strict verification provides minimal benefit. Importantly, the approach modifies only the verification rule and is fully compatible with existing target-coupled speculative decoding frameworks. Extensive experiments across model scales ranging from 8B to 235B demonstrate that our method delivers consistent and significant inference speedups over state-of-the-art baselines while preserving generation quality across diverse benchmarks.

Abstract: Volunteer-led lake monitoring yields irregular, seasonal time series with many gaps arising from ice cover, weather-related access constraints, and occasional human errors, complicating forecasting and early warning of harmful algal blooms. We study Secchi Disk Depth (SDD) forecasting on a 30-lake, data-rich subset drawn from three decades of in situ records collected across Maine lakes. Missingness is handled via Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE), and we evaluate performance with a normalized Mean Absolute Error (nMAE) metric for cross-lake comparability. Among six candidates, ridge regression provides the best mean test performance. Using ridge regression, we then quantify the minimal sample size, showing that under a backward, recent-history protocol, the model reaches within 5% of full-history accuracy with approximately 176 training samples per lake on average. We also identify a minimal feature set, where a compact four-feature subset matches the thirteen-feature baseline within the same 5% tolerance. Bringing these results together, we introduce a joint feasibility function that identifies the minimal training history and fewest predictors sufficient to achieve the target of staying within 5% of the complete-history, full-feature baseline. In our study, meeting the 5% accuracy target required about 64 recent samples and just one predictor per lake, highlighting the practicality of targeted monitoring. Hence, our joint feasibility strategy unifies recent-history length and feature choice under a fixed accuracy target, yielding a simple, efficient rule for setting sampling effort and measurement priorities for lake researchers.

TL;DR: 提出基于临床测试和MRI的机器学习方法，改进对非典型阿尔茨海默病（atAD）的诊断，相比仅使用海马体体积的方法显著提高了诊断准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病（AD）的传统诊断方法（如认知测试和海马体体积评估）对典型AD（tAD）准确率高，但对占相当比例的非典型AD（atAD）患者经常误诊。需要一种基于临床标准和MRI的非侵入性方法来提高对atAD的诊断准确性。

Method: 1. 收集来自一个私有数据集和两个公共数据集（NACC和ADNI）的1410名受试者数据，分为四组（tAD、atAD、非AD、认知正常）。2. 使用临床特征和海马体体积以及全脑MRI特征进行多组atAD vs. 非AD分类实验。3. 采用Boruta统计方法识别和可视化区分诊断组的显著脑区。

Result: 1. 结合重要MRI特征的方法表现最佳，优于仅使用海马体体积。2. 机器学习方法在NACC数据集上将atAD正确诊断率（召回率）从52%提高到69%，在ADNI数据集上从34%提高到77%，同时保持高精度。

Conclusion: 该方法仅使用临床测试和MRI数据，能显著提高非遗忘型atAD在临床环境中的诊断准确性，具有重要临床应用价值。

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD), defined as an abnormal buildup of amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain can be diagnosed with high accuracy based on protein biomarkers via PET or CSF analysis. However, due to the invasive nature of biomarker collection, most AD diagnoses are made in memory clinics using cognitive tests and evaluation of hippocampal atrophy based on MRI. While clinical assessment and hippocampal volume show high diagnostic accuracy for amnestic or typical AD (tAD), a substantial subgroup of AD patients with atypical presentation (atAD) are routinely misdiagnosed. To improve diagnosis of atAD patients, we propose a machine learning approach to distinguish between atAD and non-AD cognitive impairment using clinical testing battery and MRI data collected as standard-of-care. We develop and evaluate our approach using 1410 subjects across four groups (273 tAD, 184 atAD, 235 non-AD, and 685 cognitively normal) collected from one private data set and two public data sets from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We perform multiple atAD vs. non-AD classification experiments using clinical features and hippocampal volume as well as a comprehensive set of MRI features from across the brain. The best performance is achieved by incorporating additional important MRI features, which outperforms using hippocampal volume alone. Furthermore, we use the Boruta statistical approach to identify and visualize significant brain regions distinguishing between diagnostic groups. Our ML approach improves the percentage of correctly diagnosed atAD cases (the recall) from 52% to 69% for NACC and from 34% to 77% for ADNI, while achieving high precision. The proposed approach has important implications for improving diagnostic accuracy for non-amnestic atAD in clinical settings using only clinical testing battery and MRI.

Motivation: 机器学习模型在部署时通常进行量化以节省资源，但作者发现低比特量化会严重破坏遗忘效果，恢复模型本应遗忘的敏感或私有知识，这对实际部署的安全性构成威胁。

Method: 首先分析量化阈值对遗忘权重更新的影响，揭示典型遗忘更新幅度太小无法跨越量化阈值。为此提出logits空间hinge损失：对每个遗忘样本，强制要求遗忘后模型的输出logits与原始模型相差至少半个量化步长的边界，从而确保量化后遗忘信息保持可区分性。

Result: 在语言和分类任务（包括Twitter假新闻数据集）上的实验表明，该方法在4比特量化下能有效保持遗忘效果，而现有方法在量化后几乎完全恢复被遗忘的知识。

Conclusion: 量化过程会严重破坏机器学习遗忘的效果，需要专门设计量化感知的遗忘算法。所提出的logits空间hinge损失方法能有效抵御量化带来的信息恢复，提升实际部署中模型遗忘的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific knowledge (e.g., copyrighted or private data) from a trained model without full retraining. In practice, models are often quantized (e.g., 4-bit) for deployment, but we find that quantization can catastrophically restore forgotten information [1]. In this paper, we (1) analyze why low-bit quantization undermines unlearning, and (2) propose a quantization-aware unlearning method to mitigate this. We first compute weight-change statistics and bucket overlaps in quantization to show that typical unlearning updates are too small to cross quantization thresholds. Building on this insight, we introduce a logits space hinge loss: for each forget example, we force the output logits of the unlearned model to differ from the original model by at least a margin (half the quantization step). This ensures forgotten examples remain distinguishable even after quantization. We evaluate on language and classification tasks (including a Twitter misinformation dataset) and show our method preserves forgetting under 4-bit quantization, whereas existing methods almost entirely recover the forgotten knowledge.

Abstract: Deep learning models, particularly Transformers, are often criticized as "black boxes" and lack interpretability. We propose Prism, a white-box attention-based architecture derived from the principles of Maximizing Coding Rate Reduction ($\text{MCR}^2$). By modeling the attention mechanism as a gradient ascent process on a distinct signal-noise manifold, we introduce two physical constraints: an overcomplete dictionary to expand the representational phase space, and an irrational frequency separation ($π$-RoPE) to enforce incoherence between signal and noise subspaces. We demonstrate that these geometric inductive biases can be viewed as a physical constraint and they are sufficient to induce unsupervised functional disentanglement alone. Using TinyStories as a controlled testbed for verifying spectral dynamics, we observe that Prism spontaneously specializes its attention heads into spectrally distinct regimes: low-frequency heads capturing long-range causal dependencies (signal) and high-frequency heads handling local syntactic constraints (noise). Our results suggest that interpretability and performance are not a trade-off, but can be unified through principled geometric construction.

Motivation: 现有方法如Tent、EATA等在短期演化偏移下表现良好，但在测试分布快速变化或长时间跨度下难以适应，特别是在CCC benchmark中处理750万样本的持续变化时存在困难。

Method: 基于RDumb扩展，引入两种漂移检测机制：基于熵的漂移评分和基于KL散度的漂移评分，并结合自适应重置策略，当累积适应变得有害时能够及时检测和恢复。

Result: 在CCC-medium基准下的9次运行中，RDumb++比RDumb获得了约3%的绝对准确度提升，并在整个数据流中保持了稳定的适应能力。

Conclusion: 漂移感知重置对于防止模型崩溃和实现可靠的长期持续测试时适应至关重要。

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) seeks to update a pretrained model during deployment using only the incoming, unlabeled data stream. Although prior approaches such as Tent, EATA etc. provide meaningful improvements under short evolving shifts, they struggle when the test distribution changes rapidly or over extremely long horizons. This challenge is exemplified by the CCC benchmark, where models operate over streams of 7.5M samples with continually changing corruption types and severities. We propose RDumb++, a principled extension of RDumb that introduces two drift-detection mechanisms i.e entropy-based drift scoring and KL-divergence drift scoring, together with adaptive reset strategies. These mechanisms allow the model to detect when accumulated adaptation becomes harmful and to recover before prediction collapse occurs. Across CCC-medium with three speeds and three seeds (nine runs, each containing one million samples), RDumb++ consistently surpasses RDumb, yielding approx 3% absolute accuracy gains while maintaining stable adaptation throughout the entire stream. Ablation experiments on drift thresholds and reset strengths further show that drift-aware resetting is essential for preventing collapse and achieving reliable long-horizon CTTA.

Abstract: A key task in ML is to optimize models at various stages, e.g. by choosing hyperparameters or picking a stopping point. A traditional ML approach is to use validation loss, i.e. to apply the training loss function on a validation set to guide these optimizations. However, ML for healthcare has a distinct goal from traditional ML: Models must perform well relative to specific clinical requirements, vs. relative to the loss function used for training. These clinical requirements can be captured more precisely by tailored metrics. Since many optimization tasks do not require the driving metric to be differentiable, they allow a wider range of options, including the use of metrics tailored to be clinically-relevant. In this paper we describe two controlled experiments which show how the use of clinically-tailored metrics provide superior model optimization compared to validation loss, in the sense of better performance on the clinical task. The use of clinically-relevant metrics for optimization entails some extra effort, to define the metrics and to code them into the pipeline. But it can yield models that better meet the central goal of ML for healthcare: strong performance in the clinic.

Abstract: Real-world scientific applications frequently encounter incomplete observational data due to sensor limitations, geographic constraints, or measurement costs. Although neural operators significantly advanced PDE solving in terms of computational efficiency and accuracy, their underlying assumption of fully-observed spatial inputs severely restricts applicability in real-world applications. We introduce the first systematic framework for learning neural operators from partial observation. We identify and formalize two fundamental obstacles: (i) the supervision gap in unobserved regions that prevents effective learning of physical correlations, and (ii) the dynamic spatial mismatch between incomplete inputs and complete solution fields. Specifically, our proposed Latent Autoregressive Neural Operator~(\ours) introduces two novel components designed explicitly to address the core difficulties of partial observations: (i) a mask-to-predict training strategy that creates artificial supervision by strategically masking observed regions, and (ii) a Physics-Aware Latent Propagator that reconstructs solutions through boundary-first autoregressive generation in latent space. Additionally, we develop POBench-PDE, a dedicated and comprehensive benchmark designed specifically for evaluating neural operators under partial observation conditions across three PDE-governed tasks. \ours achieves state-of-the-art performance with 18--69$\%$ relative L2 error reduction across all benchmarks under patch-wise missingness with less than 50$\%$ missing rate, including real-world climate prediction. Our approach effectively addresses practical scenarios involving up to 75$\%$ missing rate, to some extent bridging the existing gap between idealized research settings and the complexities of real-world scientific computing.

Abstract: Managing perishable products with limited lifetimes is a fundamental challenge in inventory management, as poor ordering decisions can quickly lead to stockouts or excessive waste. We study a perishable inventory system with random lead times in which both the demand process and the lead time distribution are unknown. We consider a practical setting where orders are placed using limited historical data together with observed covariates and current system states. To improve learning efficiency under limited data, we adopt a marginal cost accounting scheme that assigns each order a single lifetime cost and yields a unified loss function for end-to-end learning. This enables training a deep learning-based policy that maps observed covariates and system states directly to order quantities. We develop two end-to-end variants: a purely black-box approach that outputs order quantities directly (E2E-BB), and a structure-guided approach that embeds the projected inventory level (PIL) policy, capturing inventory effects through explicit computation rather than additional learning (E2E-PIL). We further show that the objective induced by E2E-PIL is homogeneous of degree one, enabling a boosting technique from operational data analytics (ODA) that yields an enhanced policy (E2E-BPIL). Experiments on synthetic and real data establish a robust performance ordering: E2E-BB is dominated by E2E-PIL, which is further improved by E2E-BPIL. Using an excess-risk decomposition, we show that embedding heuristic policy structure reduces effective model complexity and improves learning efficiency with only a modest loss of flexibility. More broadly, our results suggest that deep learning-based decision tools are more effective and robust when guided by human knowledge, highlighting the value of integrating advanced analytics with inventory theory.

Abstract: This paper introduces a neural network-based nonlinear shrinkage estimator of covariance matrices for the purpose of minimum variance portfolio optimization. It is a hybrid approach that integrates statistical estimation with machine learning. Starting from the Ledoit-Wolf (LW) shrinkage estimator, we decompose the LW covariance matrix into its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and apply a lightweight transformer-based neural network to learn a nonlinear eigenvalue shrinkage function. Trained with portfolio risk as the loss function, the resulting precision matrix (the inverse covariance matrix) estimator directly targets portfolio risk minimization. By conditioning on the sample-to-dimension ratio, the approach remains scalable across different sample sizes and asset universes. Empirical results on stock daily returns from Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P500) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves lower out-of-sample realized risk than benchmark approaches. This highlights the promise of integrating structural statistical models with data-driven learning.

Abstract: 1-identification is a fundamental multi-armed bandit formulation on pure exploration. An agent aims to determine whether there exists a qualified arm whose mean reward is not less than a known threshold $μ_0$, or to output \textsf{None} if it believes such an arm does not exist. The agent needs to guarantee its output is correct with probability at least $1-δ$, while making expected total pulling times $\mathbb{E}τ$ as small as possible. We work on 1-identification with two main contributions. (1) We utilize an optimization formulation to derive a new lower bound of $\mathbb{E}τ$, when there is at least one qualified arm. (2) We design a new algorithm, deriving tight upper bounds whose gap to lower bounds are up to a polynomial of logarithm factor across all problem instance. Our result complements the analysis of $\mathbb{E}τ$ when there are multiple qualified arms, which is an open problem left by history literature.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can call tools effectively, yet they remain brittle in multi-turn execution: following a tool call error, smaller models often degenerate into repetitive invalid re-invocations, failing to interpret error feedback and self-correct. This brittleness hinders reliable real-world deployment, where the execution errors are inherently inevitable during tool interaction procedures. We identify a key limitation of current approaches: standard reinforcement learning (RL) treats errors as sparse negative rewards, providing no guidance on how to recover, while pre-collected synthetic error-correction datasets suffer from distribution mismatch with the model's on-policy error modes. To bridge this gap, we propose Fission-GRPO, a framework that converts execution errors into corrective supervision within the RL training loop. Our core mechanism fissions each failed trajectory into a new training instance by augmenting it with diagnostic feedback from a finetuned Error Simulator, then resampling recovery rollouts on-policy. This enables the model to learn from the precise errors it makes during exploration, rather than from static, pre-collected error cases. On the BFCL v4 Multi-Turn, Fission-GRPO improves the error recovery rate of Qwen3-8B by 5.7% absolute, crucially, yielding a 4% overall accuracy gain (42.75% to 46.75%) over GRPO and outperforming specialized tool-use agents.

Abstract: Bayesian optimisation is a sample efficient method for finding a global optimum of expensive black-box objective functions. Historic datasets from related problems can be exploited to help improve performance of Bayesian optimisation by adapting transfer learning methods to various components of the Bayesian optimisation pipeline. In this study we perform an empirical analysis of various ensemble-based transfer learning Bayesian optimisation methods and pipeline components. We expand on previous work in the literature by contributing some specific pipeline components, and three new real-time transfer learning Bayesian optimisation benchmarks. In particular we propose to use a weighting strategy for ensemble surrogate model predictions based on regularised regression with weights constrained to be positive, and a related component for handling the case when transfer learning is not improving Bayesian optimisation performance. We find that in general, two components that help improve transfer learning Bayesian optimisation performance are warm start initialisation and constraining weights used with ensemble surrogate model to be positive.

Abstract: Transformer-based models, despite their promise for long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), suffer from an inherent low-pass filtering effect that limits their effectiveness. This issue arises due to undifferentiated propagation of frequency components across layers, causing a progressive attenuation of high-frequency information crucial for capturing fine-grained temporal variations. To address this limitation, we propose Dualformer, a principled dual-domain framework that rethinks frequency modeling from a layer-wise perspective. Dualformer introduces three key components: (1) a dual-branch architecture that concurrently models complementary temporal patterns in both time and frequency domains; (2) a hierarchical frequency sampling module that allocates distinct frequency bands to different layers, preserving high-frequency details in lower layers while modeling low-frequency trends in deeper layers; and (3) a periodicity-aware weighting mechanism that dynamically balances contributions from the dual branches based on the harmonic energy ratio of inputs, supported theoretically by a derived lower bound. This design enables structured frequency modeling and adaptive integration of time-frequency features, effectively preserving high-frequency information and enhancing generalization. Extensive experiments conducted on eight widely used benchmarks demonstrate Dualformer's robustness and superior performance, particularly on heterogeneous or weakly periodic data. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Akira-221/Dualformer.

TL;DR: 本文提出了RLSEdit方法，用于处理大语言模型的连续流式编辑问题，在长期编辑任务中实现了编辑成功率和整体稳定性的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型编辑方法面临可塑性-稳定性困境：定位后编辑的'硬写入'会积累干扰，而零空间式的'硬保护'只保护显式约束的内容，导致过去的编辑可能被覆盖且未约束行为可能偏离，在处理大量编辑时会降低通用能力。

Method: RLSEdit将编辑建模为带软约束的在线二次优化问题，最小化累积键值拟合目标，并包含控制与预训练权重和指定锚映射偏离的两个正则化项。通过Woodbury恒等式实现高效的在线递归更新，每次编辑成本与历史长度无关，仅与当前编辑规模相关。

Result: 在多个模型系列上的实验表明，RLSEdit能稳定扩展到10K次编辑，在编辑成功率和整体稳定性方面优于强基线方法，关键能保留早期编辑，并在GLUE和推理/代码基准上保持通用能力。

Conclusion: RLSEdit为长序列模型编辑提供了一个有效的在线优化框架，通过精心设计的正则化方法平衡了编辑遵从性和模型保护，在处理大量编辑时保持了较好的稳定性和能力保留。

Abstract: Model editing updates a pre-trained LLM with new facts or rules without re-training, while preserving unrelated behavior. In real deployment, edits arrive as long streams, and existing editors often face a plasticity-stability dilemma: locate-then-edit "hard writes" can accumulate interference over time, while null-space-style "hard preservation" preserves only what is explicitly constrained, so past edits can be overwritten and unconstrained behaviors may deviate, degrading general capabilities in the many-edits regime. We propose RLSEdit, a recursive least-squares editor for long sequential editing. RLSEdit formulates editing as an online quadratic optimization with soft constraints, minimizing a cumulative key-value fitting objective with two regularizers that control for both deviation from the pre-trained weights and from a designated anchor mapping. The resulting update admits an efficient online recursion via the Woodbury identity, with per-edit cost independent of history length and scaling only with the current edit size. We further provide deviation bounds and an asymptotic characterization of the adherence-preservation trade-off in the many-edits regime. Experiments on multiple model families demonstrate stable scaling to 10K edits, outperforming strong baselines in both edit success and holistic stability -- crucially retaining early edits, and preserving general capabilities on GLUE and held-out reasoning/code benchmarks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We propose Zero-Error Horizon (ZEH) for trustworthy LLMs, which represents the maximum range that a model can solve without any errors. While ZEH itself is simple, we demonstrate that evaluating the ZEH of state-of-the-art LLMs yields abundant insights. For example, by evaluating the ZEH of GPT-5.2, we found that GPT-5.2 cannot even compute the parity of a short string like 11000, and GPT-5.2 cannot determine whether the parentheses in ((((()))))) are balanced. This is surprising given the excellent capabilities of GPT-5.2. The fact that LLMs make mistakes on such simple problems serves as an important lesson when applying LLMs to safety-critical domains. By applying ZEH to Qwen2.5 and conducting detailed analysis, we found that while ZEH correlates with accuracy, the detailed behaviors differ, and ZEH provides clues about the emergence of algorithmic capabilities. Finally, while computing ZEH incurs significant computational cost, we discuss how to mitigate this cost by achieving up to one order of magnitude speedup using tree structures and online softmax.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) unlock new ways of learning from graph-structured data, proving highly effective in capturing complex relationships and patterns. Federated GNNs (FGNNs) have emerged as a prominent distributed learning paradigm for training GNNs over decentralized data. However, FGNNs face two significant challenges: high communication overhead from multiple rounds of parameter exchanges and non-IID data characteristics across clients. To address these issues, we introduce CeFGC, a novel FGNN paradigm that facilitates efficient GNN training over non-IID data by limiting communication between the server and clients to three rounds only. The core idea of CeFGC is to leverage generative diffusion models to minimize direct client-server communication. Each client trains a generative diffusion model that captures its local graph distribution and shares this model with the server, which then redistributes it back to all clients. Using these generative models, clients generate synthetic graphs combined with their local graphs to train local GNN models. Finally, clients upload their model weights to the server for aggregation into a global GNN model. We theoretically analyze the I/O complexity of communication volume to show that CeFGC reduces to a constant of three communication rounds only. Extensive experiments on several real graph datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CeFGC against state-of-the-art competitors, reflecting our superior performance on non-IID graphs by aligning local and global model objectives and enriching the training set with diverse graphs.

Conclusion: LLM驱动内核生成是一个快速发展的新兴领域，但仍面临碎片化和系统性不足的挑战；本综述为此提供了结构化参考，并为下一代自动化内核优化奠定了基础。

Abstract: The performance of modern AI systems is fundamentally constrained by the quality of their underlying kernels, which translate high-level algorithmic semantics into low-level hardware operations. Achieving near-optimal kernels requires expert-level understanding of hardware architectures and programming models, making kernel engineering a critical but notoriously time-consuming and non-scalable process. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents have opened new possibilities for automating kernel generation and optimization. LLMs are well-suited to compress expert-level kernel knowledge that is difficult to formalize, while agentic systems further enable scalable optimization by casting kernel development as an iterative, feedback-driven loop. Rapid progress has been made in this area. However, the field remains fragmented, lacking a systematic perspective for LLM-driven kernel generation. This survey addresses this gap by providing a structured overview of existing approaches, spanning LLM-based approaches and agentic optimization workflows, and systematically compiling the datasets and benchmarks that underpin learning and evaluation in this domain. Moreover, key open challenges and future research directions are further outlined, aiming to establish a comprehensive reference for the next generation of automated kernel optimization. To keep track of this field, we maintain an open-source GitHub repository at https://github.com/flagos-ai/awesome-LLM-driven-kernel-generation.

Abstract: Drug-drug interaction (DDI) prediction is central to drug discovery and clinical development, particularly in the context of increasingly prevalent polypharmacy. Although existing computational methods achieve strong performance on standard benchmarks, they often fail to generalize to realistic deployment scenarios, where most candidate drug pairs involve previously unseen drugs and validated interactions are scarce. We demonstrate that proximity in the embedding spaces of prevailing molecule-centric DDI models does not reliably correspond to interaction labels, and that simply scaling up model capacity therefore fails to improve generalization. To address these limitations, we propose GenRel-DDI, a generalizable relation learning framework that reformulates DDI prediction as a relation-centric learning problem, in which interaction representations are learned independently of drug identities. This relation-level abstraction enables the capture of transferable interaction patterns that generalize to unseen drugs and novel drug pairs. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark demonstrate that GenRel-DDI consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with particularly large gains on strict entity-disjoint evaluations, highlighting the effectiveness and practical utility of relation learning for robust DDI prediction.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement and strong generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs), they have been increasingly incorporated into the active learning pipelines as annotators to reduce annotation costs. However, considering the annotation quality, labels generated by LLMs often fall short of real-world applicability. To address this, we propose a novel active learning framework, Mixture of LLMs in the Loop Active Learning, replacing human annotators with labels generated through a Mixture-of-LLMs-based annotation model, aimed at enhancing LLM-based annotation robustness by aggregating the strengths of multiple LLMs. To further mitigate the impact of the noisy labels, we introduce annotation discrepancy and negative learning to identify the unreliable annotations and enhance learning effectiveness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves performance comparable to human annotation and consistently outperforms single-LLM baselines and other LLM-ensemble-based approaches. Moreover, our framework is built on lightweight LLMs, enabling it to operate fully on local machines in real-world applications.

Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然经过对齐以降低风险，但其安全防护机制在面对越狱攻击时仍显脆弱。现有方法采用局部贪心归因，假设组件贡献独立，忽视了注意力头等组件间的协同交互对安全机制的共同作用。

Method: 提出全局优化安全向量提取(GOSV)框架：1）同时对所有注意力头进行全局优化；2）采用有害补丁和零消融两种互补的激活重补丁策略；3）识别出空间分布不同的恶意注入向量和安全抑制向量。

Result: 1）发现对齐LLMs中存在功能独立的安全路径；2）所有模型中重补丁约30%的总头数会导致完全安全崩溃；3）基于识别出的安全向量开发的白盒越狱攻击在实验中显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GOSV框架有效提升了LLM安全可解释性，揭示了注意力头在安全机制中的协同作用，证实了对齐模型中存在独立的安全功能通路，为理解LLM安全机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are aligned to mitigate risks, their safety guardrails remain fragile against jailbreak attacks. This reveals limited understanding of components governing safety. Existing methods rely on local, greedy attribution that assumes independent component contributions. However, they overlook the cooperative interactions between different components in LLMs, such as attention heads, which jointly contribute to safety mechanisms. We propose \textbf{G}lobal \textbf{O}ptimization for \textbf{S}afety \textbf{V}ector Extraction (GOSV), a framework that identifies safety-critical attention heads through global optimization over all heads simultaneously. We employ two complementary activation repatching strategies: Harmful Patching and Zero Ablation. These strategies identify two spatially distinct sets of safety vectors with consistently low overlap, termed Malicious Injection Vectors and Safety Suppression Vectors, demonstrating that aligned LLMs maintain separate functional pathways for safety purposes. Through systematic analyses, we find that complete safety breakdown occurs when approximately 30\% of total heads are repatched across all models. Building on these insights, we develop a novel inference-time white-box jailbreak method that exploits the identified safety vectors through activation repatching. Our attack substantially outperforms existing white-box attacks across all test models, providing strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed GOSV framework on LLM safety interpretability.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Inference in large-scale AI models is typically performed on dense parameter matrices, leading to inference cost and system complexity that scale unsustainably with model size. This limitation does not arise from insufficient model capacity, but from treating post-training inference systems as monolithic operators while ignoring internal structures formed during learning. We show that gradient update events in large models are highly localized and selective, leaving many parameter dependencies statistically indistinguishable from their initialization distribution after training. As a result, post-training inference systems are structurally non-uniform and inherently decomposable. Based on this observation, we introduce a post-training statistical criterion and a structural annealing procedure that removes unsupported dependencies and reveals stable, independent substructures. This work establishes a post-training, model-agnostic structural view of inference systems and enables structured, parallel inference without modifying model functionality or interfaces.

Abstract: Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) are currently a dominant approach for evaluating privacy in machine learning applications. Despite their significance in identifying records belonging to the training dataset, several concerns remain unexplored, particularly with regard to tabular data. In this paper, first, we provide an extensive review and analysis of MIAs considering two main learning paradigms: centralized and federated learning. We extend and refine the taxonomy for both. Second, we demonstrate the efficacy of MIAs in tabular data using several attack strategies, also including defenses. Furthermore, in a federated learning scenario, we consider the threat posed by an outsider adversary, which is often neglected. Third, we demonstrate the high vulnerability of single-outs (records with a unique signature) to MIAs. Lastly, we explore how MIAs transfer across model architectures. Our results point towards a general poor performance of these attacks in tabular data which contrasts with previous state-of-the-art. Notably, even attacks with limited attack performance can still successfully expose a large portion of single-outs. Moreover, our findings suggest that using different surrogate models makes MIAs more effective.

Motivation: 传统的分层变分自编码器（HVAE）在推断过程中面临计算效率瓶颈，特别是在处理深度模型时。本文旨在设计一种混合推断方法，结合摊销推断（速度快但质量较差）与迭代推断（质量高但慢）的优点，以实现高效率、高质量的后验估计。

Method: 提出线性可分离的变换域（如傅里叶空间）解码器架构，支持实时应用；设计混合推断框架，首先通过摊销推断获得初始后验估计，然后利用解码器梯度进行迭代细化；该方法可在不显著改变模型复杂性的情况下实现计算加速。

Result: IA-HVAE在推断速度上比传统HVAE提升35倍；在逆问题（去模糊和去噪）上，其重构质量优于基础HVAE；在精度和速度上，IA-HVAE均优于纯摊销推断和纯迭代推断方法。

Conclusion: IA-HVAE通过混合推断机制，成功结合了摊销推断的高速度和迭代推断的高精度优势，为深度生成模型的后验估计提供了新的解决方案，并在计算加速和逆问题性能上表现优异。

Abstract: In this paper we propose the Iterative Amortized Hierarchical Variational Autoencoder (IA-HVAE), which expands on amortized inference with a hybrid scheme containing an initial amortized guess and iterative refinement with decoder gradients. We achieve this by creating a linearly separable decoder in a transform domain (e.g. Fourier space), enabling real-time applications with very high model depths. The architectural change leads to a 35x speed-up for iterative inference with respect to the traditional HVAE. We show that our hybrid approach outperforms fully amortized and fully iterative equivalents in accuracy and speed respectively. Moreover, the IAHVAE shows improved reconstruction quality over a vanilla HVAE in inverse problems such as deblurring and denoising.

Conclusion: 研究表明整合多维度因素能有效预测医院访问模式，医院属性和声誉对不同人群的影响存在差异，为医疗资源配置和健康公平性政策提供了实证依据

Abstract: Healthcare visitation patterns are influenced by a complex interplay of hospital attributes, population socioeconomics, and spatial factors. However, existing research often adopts a fragmented approach, examining these determinants in isolation. This study addresses this gap by integrating hospital capacities, occupancy rates, reputation, and popularity with population SES and spatial mobility patterns to predict visitation flows and analyze influencing factors. Utilizing four years of SafeGraph mobility data and user experience data from Google Maps Reviews, five flow prediction models, Naive Regression, Gradient Boosting, Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), Deep Gravity, and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNN),were trained and applied to simulate visitation flows in Houston, Texas, U.S. The Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis and the Partial Dependence Plot (PDP) method were employed to examine the combined impacts of different factors on visitation patterns. The findings reveal that Deep Gravity outperformed other models. Hospital capacities, ICU occupancy rates, ratings, and popularity significantly influence visitation patterns, with their effects varying across different travel distances. Short-distance visits are primarily driven by convenience, whereas long-distance visits are influenced by hospital ratings. White-majority areas exhibited lower sensitivity to hospital ratings for short-distance visits, while Asian populations and those with higher education levels prioritized hospital rating in their visitation decisions. SES further influence these patterns, as areas with higher proportions of Hispanic, Black, under-18, and over-65 populations tend to have more frequent hospital visits, potentially reflecting greater healthcare needs or limited access to alternative medical services.

Abstract: We introduce $k$-lazyGD, an online learning algorithm that bridges the gap between greedy Online Gradient Descent (OGD, for $k=1$) and lazy GD/dual-averaging (for $k=T$), creating a spectrum between reactive and stable updates. We analyze this spectrum in Smoothed Online Convex Optimization (SOCO), where the learner incurs both hitting and movement costs. Our main contribution is establishing that laziness is possible without sacrificing hitting performance: we prove that $k$-lazyGD achieves the optimal dynamic regret $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{(P_T+1)T})$ for any laziness slack $k$ up to $Θ(\sqrt{T/P_T})$, where $P_T$ is the comparator path length. This result formally connects the allowable laziness to the comparator's shifts, showing that $k$-lazyGD can retain the inherently small movements of lazy methods without compromising tracking ability. We base our analysis on the Follow the Regularized Leader (FTRL) framework, and derive a matching lower bound. Since the slack depends on $P_T$, an ensemble of learners with various slacks is used, yielding a method that is provably stable when it can be, and agile when it must be.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: With the increasing flexibilization of processes, determining robust scheduling decisions has become an important goal. Traditionally, the flexibility index has been used to identify safe operating schedules by approximating the admissible uncertainty region using simple admissible uncertainty sets, such as hypercubes. Presently, available contextual information, such as forecasts, has not been considered to define the admissible uncertainty set when determining the flexibility index. We propose the conditional flexibility index (CFI), which extends the traditional flexibility index in two ways: by learning the parametrized admissible uncertainty set from historical data and by using contextual information to make the admissible uncertainty set conditional. This is achieved using a normalizing flow that learns a bijective mapping from a Gaussian base distribution to the data distribution. The admissible latent uncertainty set is constructed as a hypersphere in the latent space and mapped to the data space. By incorporating contextual information, the CFI provides a more informative estimate of flexibility by defining admissible uncertainty sets in regions that are more likely to be relevant under given conditions. Using an illustrative example, we show that no general statement can be made about data-driven admissible uncertainty sets outperforming simple sets, or conditional sets outperforming unconditional ones. However, both data-driven and conditional admissible uncertainty sets ensure that only regions of the uncertain parameter space containing realizations are considered. We apply the CFI to a security-constrained unit commitment example and demonstrate that the CFI can improve scheduling quality by incorporating temporal information.

Abstract: We study Constrained Online Convex Optimization (COCO), where a learner chooses actions iteratively, observes both unanticipated convex loss and convex constraint, and accumulates loss while incurring penalties for constraint violations. We introduce CLASP (Convex Losses And Squared Penalties), an algorithm that minimizes cumulative loss together with squared constraint violations. Our analysis departs from prior work by fully leveraging the firm non-expansiveness of convex projectors, a proof strategy not previously applied in this setting. For convex losses, CLASP achieves regret $O\left(T^{\max\{β,1-β\}}\right)$ and cumulative squared penalty $O\left(T^{1-β}\right)$ for any $β\in (0,1)$. Most importantly, for strongly convex problems, CLASP provides the first logarithmic guarantees on both regret and cumulative squared penalty. In the strongly convex case, the regret is upper bounded by $O( \log T )$ and the cumulative squared penalty is also upper bounded by $O( \log T )$.

Abstract: Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are sensitive infrastructure from both safety and economics perspectives, making their reliability critically important. Machine Learning (ML), specifically deep learning, is increasingly integrated in industrial CPS, but the inherent complexity of ML models results in non-transparent operation. Rigorous evaluation is needed to prevent models from exhibiting unexpected behaviour on future, unseen data. Explainable AI (XAI) can be used to uncover model reasoning, allowing a more extensive analysis of behaviour. We apply XAI to to improve predictive performance of ML models intended for industrial CPS. We analyse the effects of components from time-series data decomposition on model predictions using SHAP values. Through this method, we observe evidence on the lack of sufficient contextual information during model training. By increasing the window size of data instances, informed by the XAI findings, we are able to improve model performance.

Abstract: Computing the conditional mode of a distribution, better known as the $\mathit{maximum\ a\ posteriori}$ (MAP) assignment, is a fundamental task in probabilistic inference. However, MAP estimation is generally intractable, and remains hard even under many common structural constraints and approximation schemes. We introduce $\mathit{probably\ approximately\ correct}$ (PAC) algorithms for MAP inference that provide provably optimal solutions under variable and fixed computational budgets. We characterize tractability conditions for PAC-MAP using information theoretic measures that can be estimated from finite samples. Our PAC-MAP solvers are efficiently implemented using probabilistic circuits with appropriate architectures. The randomization strategies we develop can be used either as standalone MAP inference techniques or to improve on popular heuristics, fortifying their solutions with rigorous guarantees. Experiments confirm the benefits of our method in a range of benchmarks.

Abstract: Deep learning classifiers for Raman spectroscopy are increasingly reported to outperform classical chemometric approaches. However their evaluations are often conducted in isolation or compared against traditional machine learning methods or trivially adapted vision-based architectures that were not originally proposed for Raman spectroscopy. As a result, direct comparisons between existing deep learning models developed specifically for Raman spectral analysis on shared open-source datasets remain scarce. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents one of the first systematic benchmarks comparing three or more published Raman-specific deep learning classifiers across multiple open-source Raman datasets. We evaluate five representative deep learning architectures under a unified training and hyperparameter tuning protocol across three open-source Raman datasets selected to support standard evaluation, fine-tuning, and explicit distribution-shift testing. We report classification accuracies and macro-averaged F1 scores to provide a fair and reproducible comparison of deep learning models for Raman spectra based classification.

TL;DR: 论文研究了两种本征维度概念与核回归泛化性能的关系，提出了基于n宽度的误差界和估计算法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流形假设认为输入分布的低本征维度能显著提升机器学习方法的泛化性能。本文旨在探究核回归(KRR)背景下两种不同本征维度概念的关系及其对泛化性能的影响

Method: 分析了Minkowski维度和有效维度(基于Kolmogorov n宽度)的关系，建立了n宽度与积分算子特征值的联系，提出了通过有限样本估计n宽度上界的算法

Result: 导出了约束KRR的过量误差界O(n^{-(2+d_K)/(2+2d_K)+ε})，证明了对于接近均匀的分布，使用O(ε^{-d_ρ}log(1/ε))样本能以高概率计算ε精度的n宽度上界，实验显示对于某些核函数，有效维度可显著小于Minkowski维度

Conclusion: 展示了基于n宽度的有效维度对核回归泛化性能的重要影响，提供了计算有效维度的理论基础和实用算法，拓展了对高维数据下核方法性能的理解

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis suggests that the generalization performance of machine learning methods improves significantly when the intrinsic dimension of the input distribution's support is low. In the context of KRR, we investigate two alternative notions of intrinsic dimension. The first, denoted $d_ρ$, is the upper Minkowski dimension defined with respect to the canonical metric induced by a kernel function $K$ on a domain $Ω$. The second, denoted $d_K$, is the effective dimension, derived from the decay rate of Kolmogorov $n$-widths associated with $K$ on $Ω$. Given a probability measure $μ$ on $Ω$, we analyze the relationship between these $n$-widths and eigenvalues of the integral operator $φ\to \int_ΩK(\cdot,x)φ(x)dμ(x)$. We show that, for a fixed domain $Ω$, the Kolmogorov $n$-widths characterize the worst-case eigenvalue decay across all probability measures $μ$ supported on $Ω$. These eigenvalues are central to understanding the generalization behavior of constrained KRR, enabling us to derive an excess error bound of order $O(n^{-\frac{2+d_K}{2+2d_K} + ε})$ for any $ε> 0$, when the training set size $n$ is large. We also propose an algorithm that estimates upper bounds on the $n$-widths using only a finite sample from $μ$. For distributions close to uniform, we prove that $ε$-accurate upper bounds on all $n$-widths can be computed with high probability using at most $O\left(ε^{-d_ρ}\log\frac{1}ε\right)$ samples, with fewer required for small $n$. Finally, we compute the effective dimension $d_K$ for various fractal sets and present additional numerical experiments. Our results show that, for kernels such as the Laplace kernel, the effective dimension $d_K$ can be significantly smaller than the Minkowski dimension $d_ρ$, even though $d_K = d_ρ$ provably holds on regular domains.

TL;DR: Beat-SSL：ECG双上下文对比学习框架


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 获取带标签的ECG数据具有挑战性，而现有对比学习方法要么只关注全局上下文，要么未能利用ECG特异性特征，且依赖于硬对比目标，不足以捕捉ECG信号特征的连续性

Method: 提出Beat-SSL对比学习框架，通过节奏级和心跳级的双上下文学习，并采用软目标进行对比

Result: 在两个下游任务上评估：1）全局节奏评估的多标签分类任务，Beat-SSL达到了一个更大的ECG基础模型93%的性能；2）ECG分割任务，Beat-SSL超越了其他所有方法4%

Conclusion: Beat-SSL是一个有效的ECG对比学习框架，能够在有限标记数据的情况下通过双上下文学习和软目标对比提升下游任务性能

Abstract: Obtaining labelled ECG data for developing supervised models is challenging. Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a promising pretraining approach that enables effective transfer learning with limited labelled data. However, existing CL frameworks either focus solely on global context or fail to exploit ECG-specific characteristics. Furthermore, these methods rely on hard contrastive targets, which may not adequately capture the continuous nature of feature similarity in ECG signals. In this paper, we propose Beat-SSL, a contrastive learning framework that performs dual-context learning through both rhythm-level and heartbeat-level contrasting with soft targets. We evaluated our pretrained model on two downstream tasks: 1) multilabel classification for global rhythm assessment, and 2) ECG segmentation to assess its capacity to learn representations across both contexts. We conducted an ablation study and compared the best configuration with three other methods, including one ECG foundation model. Despite the foundation model's broader pretraining, Beat-SSL reached 93% of its performance in multilabel classification task and surpassed all other methods in the segmentation task by 4%.

Abstract: How can we use AI to discover a new state of the art for a scientific problem? Prior work in test-time scaling, such as AlphaEvolve, performs search by prompting a frozen LLM. We perform reinforcement learning at test time, so the LLM can continue to train, but now with experience specific to the test problem. This form of continual learning is quite special, because its goal is to produce one great solution rather than many good ones on average, and to solve this very problem rather than generalize to other problems. Therefore, our learning objective and search subroutine are designed to prioritize the most promising solutions. We call this method Test-Time Training to Discover (TTT-Discover). Following prior work, we focus on problems with continuous rewards. We report results for every problem we attempted, across mathematics, GPU kernel engineering, algorithm design, and biology. TTT-Discover sets the new state of the art in almost all of them: (i) Erdős' minimum overlap problem and an autocorrelation inequality; (ii) a GPUMode kernel competition (up to $2\times$ faster than prior art); (iii) past AtCoder algorithm competitions; and (iv) denoising problem in single-cell analysis. Our solutions are reviewed by experts or the organizers. All our results are achieved with an open model, OpenAI gpt-oss-120b, and can be reproduced with our publicly available code, in contrast to previous best results that required closed frontier models. Our test-time training runs are performed using Tinker, an API by Thinking Machines, with a cost of only a few hundred dollars per problem.

Abstract: We propose a novel training regime termed counterfactual training that leverages counterfactual explanations to increase the explanatory capacity of models. Counterfactual explanations have emerged as a popular post-hoc explanation method for opaque machine learning models: they inform how factual inputs would need to change in order for a model to produce some desired output. To be useful in real-world decision-making systems, counterfactuals should be plausible with respect to the underlying data and actionable with respect to the feature mutability constraints. Much existing research has therefore focused on developing post-hoc methods to generate counterfactuals that meet these desiderata. In this work, we instead hold models directly accountable for the desired end goal: counterfactual training employs counterfactuals during the training phase to minimize the divergence between learned representations and plausible, actionable explanations. We demonstrate empirically and theoretically that our proposed method facilitates training models that deliver inherently desirable counterfactual explanations and additionally exhibit improved adversarial robustness.

Abstract: Recent advancements in mobile and wireless networks are unlocking the full potential of robotic autonomy, enabling robots to take advantage of ultra-low latency, high data throughput, and ubiquitous connectivity. However, for robots to navigate and operate seamlessly, efficiently and reliably, they must have an accurate understanding of both their surrounding environment and the quality of radio signals. Achieving this in highly dynamic and ever-changing environments remains a challenging and largely unsolved problem. In this paper, we introduce MapViT, a two-stage Vision Transformer (ViT)-based framework inspired by the success of pre-train and fine-tune paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs). MapViT is designed to predict both environmental changes and expected radio signal quality. We evaluate the framework using a set of representative Machine Learning (ML) models, analyzing their respective strengths and limitations across different scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed two-stage pipeline enables real-time prediction, with the ViT-based implementation achieving a strong balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. This makes MapViT a promising solution for energy- and resource-constrained platforms such as mobile robots. Moreover, the geometry foundation model derived from the self-supervised pre-training stage improves data efficiency and transferability, enabling effective downstream predictions even with limited labeled data. Overall, this work lays the foundation for next-generation digital twin ecosystems, and it paves the way for a new class of ML foundation models driving multi-modal intelligence in future 6G-enabled systems.

Abstract: Dynamic resource allocation to parallel queues is a cornerstone of network scheduling, yet classical solutions often fail when accounting for the overhead of switching delays to queues with superior link conditions. In particular, system performance is further degraded when switching delays are stochastic and inhomogeneous. In this domain, the myopic, Max-Weight policy struggles, as it is agnostic to switching delays. This paper introduces ACI, a non-myopic, frame-based scheduling framework that directly amortizes these switching delays. We first use a Lyapunov drift analysis to prove that backlog-driven ACI is throughput-optimal with respect to a scaled capacity region; then validate ACI's effectiveness on multi-UAV networks with an FSO backhaul. Finally, we demonstrate how adapting its core urgency metric provides the flexibility to navigate the throughput-latency trade-off.

Abstract: The low-altitude economy (LAE) is an emerging economic paradigm which fosters integrated development across multiple fields. As a pivotal component of the LAE, low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) can restore communication by serving as aerial relays between the post-disaster areas and remote base stations (BSs). However, conventional approaches face challenges from vulnerable long-distance links between the UAVs and remote BSs, and data bottlenecks arising from massive data volumes and limited onboard UAV resources. In this work, we investigate a low-altitude multi-UAV-assisted data collection and semantic forwarding network, in which multiple UAVs collect data from ground users, form clusters, perform intra-cluster data aggregation with semantic extraction, and then cooperate as virtual antenna array (VAAs) to transmit the extracted semantic information to a remote BS via collaborative beamforming (CB). We formulate a data collection and semantic forwarding multi-objective optimization problem (DCSFMOP) that jointly maximizes both the user and semantic transmission rates while minimizing UAV energy consumption. The formulated DCSFMOP is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem that is inherently NP-hard and characterized by dynamically varying decision variable dimensionality. To address these challenges, we propose a large language model-enabled alternating optimization approach (LLM-AOA), which effectively handles the complex search space and variable dimensionality by optimizing different subsets of decision variables through tailored optimization strategies. Simulation results demonstrate that LLM-AOA outperforms AOA by approximately 26.8\% and 22.9\% in transmission rate and semantic rate, respectively.

TL;DR: 提出了ASUKA框架来解决图像修复中的两个关键问题：不需要的物体插入和颜色不一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式图像修复方法在处理大而不规则掩码时仍面临两个主要问题：模型可能凭空生成与周围环境不匹配的物体，以及修复区域经常出现明显的颜色偏移，导致纹理模糊和图像质量下降。

Method: ASUKA框架包含两个核心组件：使用重建先验引导生成模型减少物体幻觉，以及设计专门的VAE解码器将潜在特征到图像的解码过程视为局部协调任务来解决颜色一致性问题。该框架在U-Net和DiT两种代表性架构上实现，采用轻量级注入策略来最小化对模型原始生成能力的干扰。

Result: 在Places2数据集和提出的MISATO多样化基准上评估，ASUKA能有效抑制物体幻觉并提升颜色一致性，性能优于标准扩散模型、整流流模型和其他修复方法。

Conclusion: ASUKA为预训练修复模型提供了高效的后处理方法，通过结合重建先验和专门的VAE解码器，在不影响生成灵活性的前提下，显著改善了图像修复的自然度和质量。

Abstract: Generative image inpainting can produce realistic, high-fidelity results even with large, irregular masks. However, existing methods still face key issues that make inpainted images look unnatural. In this paper, we identify two main problems: (1) Unwanted object insertion: generative models may hallucinate arbitrary objects in the masked region that do not match the surrounding context. (2) Color inconsistency: inpainted regions often exhibit noticeable color shifts, leading to smeared textures and degraded image quality. We analyze the underlying causes of these issues and propose efficient post-hoc solutions for pre-trained inpainting models. Specifically, we introduce the principled framework of Aligned Stable inpainting with UnKnown Areas prior (ASUKA). To reduce unwanted object insertion, we use reconstruction-based priors to guide the generative model, suppressing hallucinated objects while preserving generative flexibility. To address color inconsistency, we design a specialized VAE decoder that formulates latent-to-image decoding as a local harmonization task. This design significantly reduces color shifts and produces more color-consistent results. We implement ASUKA on two representative inpainting architectures: a U-Net-based model and a DiT-based model. We analyze and propose lightweight injection strategies that minimize interference with the model's original generation capacity while ensuring the mitigation of the two issues. We evaluate ASUKA using the Places2 dataset and MISATO, our proposed diverse benchmark. Experiments show that ASUKA effectively suppresses object hallucination and improves color consistency, outperforming standard diffusion, rectified flow models, and other inpainting methods. Dataset, models and codes will be released in github.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种统一视觉表征架构 OpenVision 3，能同时支持图像理解与生成。它通过 ViT-VAE 解码重构图像与对比学习、图像描述目标联合训练，在语义与生成上均表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的视觉系统在图像理解与生成上通常是分开构建的。OpenVision 3 旨在学习单一的统一视觉表征，使得同一个模型既能用于理解任务（如视觉问答）也能用于生成任务（如图像重建），以促进更通用的视觉建模研究。

Method: 架构的核心是把 VAE 压缩的图像潜变量输入 ViT 编码器，并通过两种互补的路径进行训练：1）用 ViT-VAE 解码器重构原图，捕捉生成结构；2）用对比学习与图像描述目标优化语义特征。两者在共享潜空间中联合优化，以在语义与生成上实现协同。

Result: 下游实验显示：在 LLaVA-1.5 视觉问答框架中性能与标准 CLIP 编码器相当；在 RAE 框架进行图像生成时，其 gFID 评分显著优于基于 CLIP 的编码器。这表明统一模型在理解与生成两方面均能取得优越表现。

Conclusion: OpenVision 3 展示了一种统一视觉模型在图像理解与生成上的可行性与优势。这项工作为未来视觉统一建模提供了实证基础，激励进一步的研究。

Abstract: This paper presents a family of advanced vision encoder, named OpenVision 3, that learns a single, unified visual representation that can serve both image understanding and image generation. Our core architecture is simple: we feed VAE-compressed image latents to a ViT encoder and train its output to support two complementary roles. First, the encoder output is passed to the ViT-VAE decoder to reconstruct the original image, encouraging the representation to capture generative structure. Second, the same representation is optimized with contrastive learning and image-captioning objectives, strengthening semantic features. By jointly optimizing reconstruction- and semantics-driven signals in a shared latent space, the encoder learns representations that synergize and generalize well across both regimes. We validate this unified design through extensive downstream evaluations with the encoder frozen. For multimodal understanding, we plug the encoder into the LLaVA-1.5 framework: it performs comparably with a standard CLIP vision encoder (e.g., 62.4 vs 62.2 on SeedBench, and 83.7 vs 82.9 on POPE). For generation, we test it under the RAE framework: ours substantially surpasses the standard CLIP-based encoder (e.g., gFID: 1.89 vs 2.54 on ImageNet). We hope this work can spur future research on unified modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤恶性病变的早期检测对患者预后至关重要。现有基于ABCD规则的手工特征方法可能难以捕捉复杂形态特征，需要探索机器学习方法提升诊断性能。

Method: 使用HAM10000数据集的1000张图像，比较基于ABCD规则的自动TDS评分系统与多种机器学习方法（逻辑回归、随机森林、SVM）及深度学习模型（EfficientNet-B0迁移学习、自定义三层CNN）。

Result: 规则系统虽临床可解释性强，但性能受限；EfficientNet-B0因域偏移表现不佳；自定义CNN在经中值滤波的图像上达到78.5%准确率和86.5%召回率，相比传统方法提升19个百分点。

Conclusion: 直接像素级学习能捕捉超越手工特征的诊断模式，针对小规模医学数据集，从头训练的轻量级定制架构优于大型预训练模型。

Abstract: Early detection of malignant skin lesions is critical for improving patient outcomes in aggressive, metastatic skin cancers. This study evaluates a comprehensive system for preliminary skin lesion assessment that combines the clinically established ABCD rule of dermoscopy (analyzing Asymmetry, Borders, Color, and Dermoscopic Structures) with machine learning classification. Using a 1,000-image subset of the HAM10000 dataset, the system implements an automated, rule-based pipeline to compute a Total Dermoscopy Score (TDS) for each lesion. This handcrafted approach is compared against various machine learning solutions, including traditional classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM) and deep learning models. While the rule-based system provides high clinical interpretability, results indicate a performance bottleneck when reducing complex morphology to five numerical features. Experimental findings show that transfer learning with EfficientNet-B0 failed significantly due to domain shift between natural and medical images. In contrast, a custom three-layer Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained from scratch achieved 78.5% accuracy and 86.5% recall on median-filtered images, representing a 19-point accuracy improvement over traditional methods. The results demonstrate that direct pixel-level learning captures diagnostic patterns beyond handcrafted features and that purpose-built lightweight architectures can outperform large pretrained models for small, domain-specific medical datasets.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of cervical structures in transvaginal ultrasound (TVS) is critical for assessing the risk of spontaneous preterm birth (PTB), yet the scarcity of labeled data limits the performance of supervised learning approaches. This paper introduces the Fetal Ultrasound Grand Challenge (FUGC), the first benchmark for semi-supervised learning in cervical segmentation, hosted at ISBI 2025. FUGC provides a dataset of 890 TVS images, including 500 training images, 90 validation images, and 300 test images. Methods were evaluated using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff Distance (HD), and runtime (RT), with a weighted combination of 0.4/0.4/0.2. The challenge attracted 10 teams with 82 participants submitting innovative solutions. The best-performing methods for each individual metric achieved 90.26\% mDSC, 38.88 mHD, and 32.85 ms RT, respectively. FUGC establishes a standardized benchmark for cervical segmentation, demonstrates the efficacy of semi-supervised methods with limited labeled data, and provides a foundation for AI-assisted clinical PTB risk assessment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前地球观测基础模型存在架构僵化、难以处理异构传感器数据、受限于固定补丁大小等问题，限制了其在需要灵活计算-精度权衡的真实场景中的部署。

Method: 提出了THOR模型：1) 首个能够统一处理Copernicus Sentinel-1、-2和-3卫星数据（分辨率从10米到1000米）的架构；2) 采用新颖的随机化补丁和输入图像大小策略进行预训练；3) 使用单一权重集即可在推理时适应任意补丁大小。

Result: 1) 在THOR Pretrain新的大规模多传感器数据集上进行预训练；2) 在下游基准测试中取得最先进的性能；3) 在数据有限的情况下（如PANGAEA 10%分割）表现优异，验证了其灵活特征生成在不同气候和社会应用中的优势。

Conclusion: THOR通过解决输入异构性和部署刚性问题，提供了动态权衡计算成本和特征分辨率的能力，为地球观测基础模型的实际应用开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Current Earth observation foundation models are architecturally rigid, struggle with heterogeneous sensors and are constrained to fixed patch sizes. This limits their deployment in real-world scenarios requiring flexible computeaccuracy trade-offs. We propose THOR, a "computeadaptive" foundation model that solves both input heterogeneity and deployment rigidity. THOR is the first architecture to unify data from Copernicus Sentinel-1, -2, and -3 (OLCI & SLSTR) satellites, processing their native 10 m to 1000 m resolutions in a single model. We pre-train THOR with a novel randomized patch and input image size strategy. This allows a single set of pre-trained weights to be deployed at inference with any patch size, enabling a dynamic trade-off between computational cost and feature resolution without retraining. We pre-train THOR on THOR Pretrain, a new, large-scale multi-sensor dataset and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on downstream benchmarks, particularly in data-limited regimes like the PANGAEA 10% split, validating that THOR's flexible feature generation excels for diverse climate and society applications.

Abstract: Deep learning has substantially advanced medical image segmentation, yet achieving robust generalization across diverse imaging modalities and anatomical structures remains a major challenge. A key contributor to this limitation lies in how existing architectures, ranging from CNNs to Transformers and their hybrids, primarily encode spatial information while overlooking frequency-domain representations that capture rich structural and textural cues. Although few recent studies have begun exploring spectral information at the feature level, supervision-level integration of frequency cues-crucial for fine-grained object localization-remains largely untapped. To this end, we propose Phi-SegNet, a CNN-based architecture that incorporates phase-aware information at both architectural and optimization levels. The network integrates Bi-Feature Mask Former (BFMF) modules that blend neighboring encoder features to reduce semantic gaps, and Reverse Fourier Attention (RFA) blocks that refine decoder outputs using phase-regularized features. A dedicated phase-aware loss aligns these features with structural priors, forming a closed feedback loop that emphasizes boundary precision. Evaluated on five public datasets spanning X-ray, US, histopathology, MRI, and colonoscopy, Phi-SegNet consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance, with an average relative improvement of 1.54+/-1.26% in IoU and 0.98+/-0.71% in F1-score over the next best-performing model. In cross-dataset generalization scenarios involving unseen datasets from the known domain, Phi-SegNet also exhibits robust and superior performance, highlighting its adaptability and modality-agnostic design. These findings demonstrate the potential of leveraging spectral priors in both feature representation and supervision, paving the way for generalized segmentation frameworks that excel in fine-grained object localization.
