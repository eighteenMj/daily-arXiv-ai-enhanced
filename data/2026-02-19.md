TL;DR: 该研究提出了FlipSet基准来评估视觉语言模型的二级视觉视角采择能力，发现主流模型存在系统性自我中心偏差和组合性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉视角采择是社会认知的基础能力，但现有视觉语言模型在这方面的系统评估存在空白，需要构建诊断性基准来揭示模型在空间推理和社交认知整合方面的根本性局限。

Method: 开发FlipSet诊断基准，要求模型模拟二维字符串的180度旋转来评估二级视觉视角采择能力，避免三维场景复杂性干扰。评估了103个视觉语言模型，设计了控制实验来分离社交意识和空间操作能力。

Result: 模型表现出系统性自我中心偏差：大多数模型表现低于随机水平，约四分之三的错误重现了摄像头视角。模型在单独的社交认知和空间旋转任务上表现良好，但整合这两种能力时出现灾难性失败。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型缺乏将社交意识与空间操作绑定的机制，存在基于模型的空间推理的根本性局限。FlipSet为多模态系统的视角采择能力诊断提供了认知基础测试平台。

Abstract: Visual perspective taking--inferring how the world appears from another's viewpoint--is foundational to social cognition. We introduce FlipSet, a diagnostic benchmark for Level-2 visual perspective taking (L2 VPT) in vision-language models. The task requires simulating 180-degree rotations of 2D character strings from another agent's perspective, isolating spatial transformation from 3D scene complexity. Evaluating 103 VLMs reveals systematic egocentric bias: the vast majority perform below chance, with roughly three-quarters of errors reproducing the camera viewpoint. Control experiments expose a compositional deficit--models achieve high theory-of-mind accuracy and above-chance mental rotation in isolation, yet fail catastrophically when integration is required. This dissociation indicates that current VLMs lack the mechanisms needed to bind social awareness to spatial operations, suggesting fundamental limitations in model-based spatial reasoning. FlipSet provides a cognitively grounded testbed for diagnosing perspective-taking capabilities in multimodal systems.

*Jingwei Li,Jiaxin Tong,Pengfei Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MSBA-CLIP框架，结合多变量软混合增强与CLIP指导的伪造强度估计，提升Deepfake检测的准确性和泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Deepfake检测方法面临准确率有限、泛化性差的问题，这主要是由于不同伪造技术导致的显著分布偏移

Method: 1）利用CLIP的多模态对齐能力捕捉微妙伪造痕迹；2）提出多变量软混合增强（MSBA）策略，通过随机权重混合多种伪造方法合成的图像；3）设计多变量伪造强度估计（MFIE）模块，显式指导模型学习不同伪造模式和强度的特征

Result: 1）域内测试：准确率（Accuracy）提升3.32%，AUC提升4.02%，优于当前最佳基线方法；2）跨域评估：在五个数据集上平均AUC增益达3.27%；3）消融研究证实了两个组件的有效性

Conclusion: 尽管依赖大型视觉语言模型带来了较高的计算成本，但该研究为更通用、更鲁棒的Deepfake检测迈出了重要一步，显著提升了检测器的性能和泛化能力

Abstract: The proliferation of highly realistic facial forgeries necessitates robust detection methods. However, existing approaches often suffer from limited accuracy and poor generalization due to significant distribution shifts among samples generated by diverse forgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multivariate and Soft Blending Augmentation with CLIP-guided Forgery Intensity Estimation (MSBA-CLIP) framework. Our method leverages the multimodal alignment capabilities of CLIP to capture subtle forgery traces. We introduce a Multivariate and Soft Blending Augmentation (MSBA) strategy that synthesizes images by blending forgeries from multiple methods with random weights, forcing the model to learn generalizable patterns. Furthermore, a dedicated Multivariate Forgery Intensity Estimation (MFIE) module is designed to explicitly guide the model in learning features related to varied forgery modes and intensities. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. On in-domain tests, our method improves Accuracy and AUC by 3.32\% and 4.02\%, respectively, over the best baseline. In cross-domain evaluations across five datasets, it achieves an average AUC gain of 3.27\%. Ablation studies confirm the efficacy of both proposed components. While the reliance on a large vision-language model entails higher computational cost, our work presents a significant step towards more generalizable and robust deepfake detection.

Abstract: LiDAR sensors are often considered essential for autonomous driving, but high-resolution sensors remain expensive while affordable low-resolution sensors produce sparse point clouds that miss critical details. LiDAR super-resolution addresses this challenge by using deep learning to enhance sparse point clouds, bridging the gap between different sensor types and enabling cross-sensor compatibility in real-world deployments. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of LiDAR super-resolution methods for autonomous driving. Despite the importance of practical deployment, no systematic review has been conducted until now. We organize existing approaches into four categories: CNN-based architectures, model-based deep unrolling, implicit representation methods, and Transformer and Mamba-based approaches. We establish fundamental concepts including data representations, problem formulation, benchmark datasets and evaluation metrics. Current trends include the adoption of range image representation for efficient processing, extreme model compression and the development of resolution-flexible architectures. Recent research prioritizes real-time inference and cross-sensor generalization for practical deployment. We conclude by identifying open challenges and future research directions for advancing LiDAR super-resolution technology.

Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA) requires models to answer questions by integrating visual information with external knowledge. However, retrieved knowledge is often noisy, partially irrelevant, or misaligned with the visual content, while internal model knowledge is difficult to control and interpret. Naive aggregation of these sources limits reasoning effectiveness and reduces answer accuracy. To address this, we propose MaS-VQA, a selection-driven framework that tightly couples explicit knowledge filtering with implicit knowledge reasoning. MaS-VQA first retrieves candidate passages and applies a Mask-and-Select mechanism to jointly prune irrelevant image regions and weakly relevant knowledge fragments, producing compact, high-signal multimodal knowledge . This filtered knowledge then guides the activation of internal knowledge in a constrained semantic space, enabling complementary co-modeling of explicit and implicit knowledge for robust answer prediction. Experiments on Encyclopedic-VQA and InfoSeek demonstrate consistent performance gains across multiple MLLM backbones, and ablations verify that the selection mechanism effectively reduces noise and enhances knowledge utilization.

TL;DR: 本文提出了EarthSpatialBench，这是一个用于评估多模态大语言模型在地球影像上的空间推理能力的综合基准，包含超过32.5万个问答对，涵盖距离、方向、拓扑关系和复杂几何形状等维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有地球影像基准主要集中在2D空间定位、图像描述和粗略空间关系上，缺乏对定量方向距离推理、系统拓扑关系和复杂几何形状的支持，而这对具身AI等需要与物理世界精确交互的系统至关重要。

Method: 作者设计了EarthSpatialBench基准，包含定性/定量距离方向推理、系统拓扑关系、单对象/对象对/组合聚合查询，以及通过文本描述、视觉叠加和显式几何坐标（边界框、折线、多边形）表示的对象参考。

Result: 通过在开源和专有模型上的大量实验，该基准揭示了MLLMs在地球影像空间推理方面的局限性。

Conclusion: EarthSpatialBench填补了地球影像空间推理评估的空白，为提升MLLMs在需要精确物理世界交互的系统中的表现提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Benchmarking spatial reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has attracted growing interest in computer vision due to its importance for embodied AI and other agentic systems that require precise interaction with the physical world. However, spatial reasoning on Earth imagery has lagged behind, as it uniquely involves grounding objects in georeferenced images and quantitatively reasoning about distances, directions, and topological relations using both visual cues and vector geometry coordinates (e.g., 2D bounding boxes, polylines, and polygons). Existing benchmarks for Earth imagery primarily focus on 2D spatial grounding, image captioning, and coarse spatial relations (e.g., simple directional or proximity cues). They lack support for quantitative direction and distance reasoning, systematic topological relations, and complex object geometries beyond bounding boxes. To fill this gap, we propose \textbf{EarthSpatialBench}, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating spatial reasoning in MLLMs on Earth imagery. The benchmark contains over 325K question-answer pairs spanning: (1) qualitative and quantitative reasoning about spatial distance and direction; (2) systematic topological relations; (3) single-object queries, object-pair queries, and compositional aggregate group queries; and (4) object references expressed via textual descriptions, visual overlays, and explicit geometry coordinates, including 2D bounding boxes, polylines, and polygons. We conducted extensive experiments on both open-source and proprietary models to identify limitations in the spatial reasoning of MLLMs.

It provides information on the different object detection models available, open benchmark datasets, and studies on the use of object detection models in a range of applications. Additionally, controlled studies are provided to compare various strategies and produce some illuminating findings. Last but not least, a number of encouraging challenges and approaches are offered as suggestions for further investigation in both relevant deep learning approaches and object recognition.

### [7] [Can Vision-Language Models See Squares? Text-Recognition Mediates Spatial Reasoning Across Three Model Families](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15950)
*Yuval Levental*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 视觉语言模型（VLMs）在定位二进制网格中缺乏文本标识的填充单元格时存在根本性限制，即使视觉编码器相同，仅视觉元素从文本符号变为填充方块，模型性能即大幅下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型在空间定位非文本视觉元素时的能力局限，揭示其依赖文本识别路径而非原生视觉路径进行空间推理的潜在缺陷。

Method: 生成15个15x15的二进制网格（填充密度10.7%-41.8%），以两种图像类型呈现：文本符号（.和#）和无网格线的填充方块。使用三种前沿VLM（Claude Opus、ChatGPT 5.2和Gemini 3 Thinking）进行转录任务比较。

Result: 文本符号条件下，Claude和ChatGPT达到约91%单元格准确率和84% F1，Gemini为84%准确率和63% F1；填充方块条件下，所有模型性能崩溃至60-73%准确率和29-39% F1。不同模型展现出不同的失败模式：系统低估（Claude）、过度高估（ChatGPT）和模板幻觉（Gemini）。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型表现出对文本识别路径的高度依赖，其原生视觉路径在空间定位非文本元素时存在严重缺陷，文本与方块条件的性能差距达34-54个F1点，揭示了VLM空间推理能力的根本局限性。

Abstract: We present a simple experiment that exposes a fundamental limitation in vision-language models (VLMs): the inability to accurately localize filled cells in binary grids when those cells lack textual identity. We generate fifteen 15x15 grids with varying density (10.7%-41.8% filled cells) and render each as two image types -- text symbols (. and #) and filled squares without gridlines -- then ask three frontier VLMs (Claude Opus, ChatGPT 5.2, and Gemini 3 Thinking) to transcribe them. In the text-symbol condition, Claude and ChatGPT achieve approximately 91% cell accuracy and 84% F1, while Gemini achieves 84% accuracy and 63% F1. In the filled-squares condition, all three models collapse to 60-73% accuracy and 29-39% F1. Critically, all conditions pass through the same visual encoder -- the text symbols are images, not tokenized text. The text-vs-squares F1 gap ranges from 34 to 54 points across models, demonstrating that VLMs behave as if they possess a high-fidelity text-recognition pathway for spatial reasoning that dramatically outperforms their native visual pathway. Each model exhibits a distinct failure mode in the squares condition -- systematic under-counting (Claude), massive over-counting (ChatGPT), and template hallucination (Gemini) -- but all share the same underlying deficit: severely degraded spatial localization for non-textual visual elements.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: High-speed optical-resolution photoacoustic microscopy (OR-PAM) with bidirectional raster scanning doubles imaging speed but introduces coupled domain shift and geometric misalignment between forward and backward scan lines. Existing registration methods, constrained by brightness constancy assumptions, achieve limited alignment quality, while recent generative approaches address domain shift through complex architectures that lack temporal awareness across frames. We propose GPEReg-Net, a scene-appearance disentanglement framework that separates domain-invariant scene features from domain-specific appearance codes via Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN), enabling direct image-to-image registration without explicit deformation field estimation. To exploit temporal structure in sequential acquisitions, we introduce a Global Position Encoding (GPE) module that combines learnable position embeddings with sinusoidal encoding and cross-frame attention, allowing the network to leverage context from neighboring frames for improved temporal coherence. On the OR-PAM-Reg-4K benchmark (432 test samples), GPEReg-Net achieves NCC of 0.953, SSIM of 0.932, and PSNR of 34.49dB, surpassing the state-of-the-art by 3.8% in SSIM and 1.99dB in PSNR while maintaining competitive NCC. Code is available at https://github.com/JiahaoQin/GPEReg-Net.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Holstein-Friesian detection and re-identification (Re-ID) methods capture individuals well when targets are spatially separate. However, existing approaches, including YOLO-based species detection, break down when cows group closely together. This is particularly prevalent for species which have outline-breaking coat patterns. To boost both effectiveness and transferability in this setting, we propose a new detect-segment-identify pipeline that leverages the Open-Vocabulary Weight-free Localisation and the Segment Anything models as pre-processing stages alongside Re-ID networks. To evaluate our approach, we publish a collection of nine days CCTV data filmed on a working dairy farm. Our methodology overcomes detection breakdown in dense animal groupings, resulting in a 98.93% accuracy. This significantly outperforms current oriented bounding box-driven, as well as SAM species detection baselines with accuracy improvements of 47.52% and 27.13%, respectively. We show that unsupervised contrastive learning can build on this to yield 94.82% Re-ID accuracy on our test data. Our work demonstrates that Re-ID in crowded scenarios is both practical as well as reliable in working farm settings with no manual intervention. Code and dataset are provided for reproducibility.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Continuous monitoring of vital signs in Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) is essential for early detection of clinical deterioration and effective clinical decision-making. However, contact-based sensors such as pulse oximeters may cause skin irritation, increase infection risk, and lead to patient discomfort. Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) offers a contactless alternative to monitor heart rate using facial video, but remains underutilized in PICUs due to motion artifacts, occlusions, variable lighting, and domain shifts between laboratory and clinical data.
  We introduce a self-supervised pretraining framework for rPPG estimation in the PICU setting, based on a progressive curriculum strategy. The approach leverages the VisionMamba architecture and integrates an adaptive masking mechanism, where a lightweight Mamba-based controller assigns spatiotemporal importance scores to guide probabilistic patch sampling. This strategy dynamically increases reconstruction difficulty while preserving physiological relevance.
  To address the lack of labeled clinical data, we adopt a teacher-student distillation setup. A supervised expert model, trained on public datasets, provides latent physiological guidance to the student. The curriculum progresses through three stages: clean public videos, synthetic occlusion scenarios, and unlabeled videos from 500 pediatric patients.
  Our framework achieves a 42% reduction in mean absolute error relative to standard masked autoencoders and outperforms PhysFormer by 31%, reaching a final MAE of 3.2 bpm. Without explicit region-of-interest extraction, the model consistently attends to pulse-rich areas and demonstrates robustness under clinical occlusions and noise.

Abstract: Neuromorphic engineering has a data problem. Despite the meteoric rise in the number of neuromorphic datasets published over the past ten years, the conclusion of a significant portion of neuromorphic research papers still states that there is a need for yet more data and even larger datasets. Whilst this need is driven in part by the sheer volume of data required by modern deep learning approaches, it is also fuelled by the current state of the available neuromorphic datasets and the difficulties in finding them, understanding their purpose, and determining the nature of their underlying task. This is further compounded by practical difficulties in downloading and using these datasets. This review starts by capturing a snapshot of the existing neuromorphic datasets, covering over 423 datasets, and then explores the nature of their tasks and the underlying structure of the presented data. Analysing these datasets shows the difficulties arising from their size, the lack of standardisation, and difficulties in accessing the actual data. This paper also highlights the growth in the size of individual datasets and the complexities involved in working with the data. However, a more important concern is the rise of synthetic datasets, created by either simulation or video-to-events methods. This review explores the benefits of simulated data for testing existing algorithms and applications, highlighting the potential pitfalls for exploring new applications of neuromorphic technologies. This review also introduces the concepts of meta-datasets, created from existing datasets, as a way of both reducing the need for more data, and to remove potential bias arising from defining both the dataset and the task.

Abstract: We introduce SAM 3D Body (3DB), a promptable model for single-image full-body 3D human mesh recovery (HMR) that demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, with strong generalization and consistent accuracy in diverse in-the-wild conditions. 3DB estimates the human pose of the body, feet, and hands. It is the first model to use a new parametric mesh representation, Momentum Human Rig (MHR), which decouples skeletal structure and surface shape. 3DB employs an encoder-decoder architecture and supports auxiliary prompts, including 2D keypoints and masks, enabling user-guided inference similar to the SAM family of models. We derive high-quality annotations from a multi-stage annotation pipeline that uses various combinations of manual keypoint annotation, differentiable optimization, multi-view geometry, and dense keypoint detection. Our data engine efficiently selects and processes data to ensure data diversity, collecting unusual poses and rare imaging conditions. We present a new evaluation dataset organized by pose and appearance categories, enabling nuanced analysis of model behavior. Our experiments demonstrate superior generalization and substantial improvements over prior methods in both qualitative user preference studies and traditional quantitative analysis. Both 3DB and MHR are open-source.

Abstract: Vision-language foundation models have emerged as powerful general-purpose representation learners with strong potential for multimodal understanding, but their deterministic embeddings often fail to provide the reliability required for high-stakes biomedical applications. This work introduces MedProbCLIP, a probabilistic vision-language learning framework for chest X-ray and radiology report representation learning and bidirectional retrieval. MedProbCLIP models image and text representations as Gaussian embeddings through a probabilistic contrastive objective that explicitly captures uncertainty and many-to-many correspondences between radiographs and clinical narratives. A variational information bottleneck mitigates overconfident predictions, while MedProbCLIP employs multi-view radiograph encoding and multi-section report encoding during training to provide fine-grained supervision for clinically aligned correspondence, yet requires only a single radiograph and a single report at inference. Evaluated on the MIMIC-CXR dataset, MedProbCLIP outperforms deterministic and probabilistic baselines, including CLIP, CXR-CLIP, and PCME++, in both retrieval and zero-shot classification. Beyond accuracy, MedProbCLIP demonstrates superior calibration, risk-coverage behavior, selective retrieval reliability, and robustness to clinically relevant corruptions, underscoring the value of probabilistic vision-language modeling for improving the trustworthiness and safety of radiology image-text retrieval systems.

Abstract: Discrete image tokenization is a key bottleneck for scalable visual generation: a tokenizer must remain compact for efficient latent-space priors while preserving semantic structure and using discrete capacity effectively. Existing quantizers face a trade-off: vector-quantized tokenizers learn flexible geometries but often suffer from biased straight-through optimization, codebook under-utilization, and representation collapse at large vocabularies. Structured scalar or implicit tokenizers ensure stable, near-complete utilization by design, yet rely on fixed discretization geometries that may allocate capacity inefficiently under heterogeneous latent statistics.
  We introduce Learnable Geometric Quantization (LGQ), a discrete image tokenizer that learns discretization geometry end-to-end. LGQ replaces hard nearest-neighbor lookup with temperature-controlled soft assignments, enabling fully differentiable training while recovering hard assignments at inference. The assignments correspond to posterior responsibilities of an isotropic Gaussian mixture and minimize a variational free-energy objective, provably converging to nearest-neighbor quantization in the low-temperature limit. LGQ combines a token-level peakedness regularizer with a global usage regularizer to encourage confident yet balanced code utilization without imposing rigid grids.
  Under a controlled VQGAN-style backbone on ImageNet across multiple vocabulary sizes, LGQ achieves stable optimization and balanced utilization. At 16K codebook size, LGQ improves rFID by 11.88% over FSQ while using 49.96% fewer active codes, and improves rFID by 6.06% over SimVQ with 49.45% lower effective representation rate, achieving comparable fidelity with substantially fewer active entries.

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) is one of the most widely used and diagnostically information-dense imaging modalities, covering critical organs such as the heart, lungs, liver, and colon. Clinical interpretation relies on both slice-driven local features (e.g., sub-centimeter nodules, lesion boundaries) and volume-driven spatial representations (e.g., tumor infiltration, inter-organ anatomical relations). However, existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) remain fragmented in CT slice versus volumetric understanding: slice-driven LVLMs show strong generalization but lack cross-slice spatial consistency, while volume-driven LVLMs explicitly capture volumetric semantics but suffer from coarse granularity and poor compatibility with slice inputs. The absence of a unified modeling paradigm constitutes a major bottleneck for the clinical translation of medical LVLMs. We present OmniCT, a powerful unified slice-volume LVLM for CT scenarios, which makes three contributions: (i) Spatial Consistency Enhancement (SCE): volumetric slice composition combined with tri-axial positional embedding that introduces volumetric consistency, and an MoE hybrid projection enables efficient slice-volume adaptation; (ii) Organ-level Semantic Enhancement (OSE): segmentation and ROI localization explicitly align anatomical regions, emphasizing lesion- and organ-level semantics; (iii) MedEval-CT: the largest slice-volume CT dataset and hybrid benchmark integrates comprehensive metrics for unified evaluation. OmniCT consistently outperforms existing methods with a substantial margin across diverse clinical tasks and satisfies both micro-level detail sensitivity and macro-level spatial reasoning. More importantly, it establishes a new paradigm for cross-modal medical imaging understanding.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Text-to-video diffusion models deliver impressive results but remain slow because of the sequential denoising of 3D latents. Existing approaches to speed up inference either require expensive model retraining or use heuristic-based step skipping, which struggles to maintain video quality as the number of denoising steps decreases. Our work, CHAI, aims to use cross-inference caching to reduce latency while maintaining video quality. We introduce Cache Attention as an effective method for attending to shared objects/scenes across cross-inference latents. This selective attention mechanism enables effective reuse of cached latents across semantically related prompts, yielding high cache hit rates. We show that it is possible to generate high-quality videos using Cache Attention with as few as 8 denoising steps. When integrated into the overall system, CHAI is 1.65x - 3.35x faster than baseline OpenSora 1.2 while maintaining video quality.

Result: 在包含500个独特图像-问题对的大规模用户研究中，IRIS方法将歧义问题的回答准确率从35.2%大幅提升至77.2%（超过两倍提升），同时在非歧义查询上保持性能稳定。不同架构的先进VLM在整合注视数据后均表现出一致改进。

Conclusion: 实时眼动追踪数据能有效消解开放式VQA中的歧义，显著提升回答准确性。IRIS方法具有架构无关性，无需修改或重新训练现有模型。研究同时发布了新的基准数据集、实时交互协议和评估套件，为融合视觉-语言-眼动多模态交互研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: We introduce IRIS (Intent Resolution via Inference-time Saccades), a novel training-free approach that uses eye-tracking data in real-time to resolve ambiguity in open-ended VQA. Through a comprehensive user study with 500 unique image-question pairs, we demonstrate that fixations closest to the time participants start verbally asking their questions are the most informative for disambiguation in Large VLMs, more than doubling the accuracy of responses on ambiguous questions (from 35.2% to 77.2%) while maintaining performance on unambiguous queries. We evaluate our approach across state-of-the-art VLMs, showing consistent improvements when gaze data is incorporated in ambiguous image-question pairs, regardless of architectural differences. We release a new benchmark dataset to use eye movement data for disambiguated VQA, a novel real-time interactive protocol, and an evaluation suite.

TL;DR: 本研究通过构建诊断性基准测试，揭示了开放权重图像到图像编辑器中普遍存在且不同群体间不均衡的身份保持失败模式，并展示仅通过提示词修改即可在不更新模型的情况下显著减少少数群体的身份变更。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然文本到图像生成的人口统计学偏差已被广泛研究，但在指令引导的图像到图像编辑中，与人口统计特征相关的编辑失败模式仍未被充分探索。本研究旨在探究相同的编辑指令是否会因输入图像中人物的种族、性别和年龄等人口统计学特征而产生系统性不同的编辑结果。

Method: 研究建立了受控的基准测试，通过诊断性提示集生成和编辑不同种族、性别、年龄条件的肖像图像，并评估多个图像编辑器。采用视觉语言模型自动评分和人工评估相结合的方法，分析编辑器的表现。研究还通过添加提示词级别的身份约束（无需更新模型）来测试缓解身份变更的效果。

Result: 研究发现身份保持失败在图像编辑中普遍存在，且在不同人口统计群体间分布不均，受到隐性社会先验（如职业驱动的性别推断）的影响。实验表明，仅通过提示词级别的身份约束就能显著减少少数群体的身份变更，而对多数群体的画像影响较小，揭示了当前编辑器中不对称的身份先验。

Conclusion: 本研究表明身份保持是图像到图像编辑中一个核心且在不同人口统计特征间分布不均的失败模式，为此需要开发具有人口统计学鲁棒性的编辑系统。

Abstract: Demographic bias in text-to-image (T2I) generation is well studied, yet demographic-conditioned failures in instruction-guided image-to-image (I2I) editing remain underexplored. We examine whether identical edit instructions yield systematically different outcomes across subject demographics in open-weight I2I editors. We formalize two failure modes: Soft Erasure, where edits are silently weakened or ignored in the output image, and Stereotype Replacement, where edits introduce unrequested, stereotype-consistent attributes. We introduce a controlled benchmark that probes demographic-conditioned behavior by generating and editing portraits conditioned on race, gender, and age using a diagnostic prompt set, and evaluate multiple editors with vision-language model (VLM) scoring and human evaluation. Our analysis shows that identity preservation failures are pervasive, demographically uneven, and shaped by implicit social priors, including occupation-driven gender inference. Finally, we demonstrate that a prompt-level identity constraint, without model updates, can substantially reduce demographic change for minority groups while leaving majority-group portraits largely unchanged, revealing asymmetric identity priors in current editors. Together, our findings establish identity preservation as a central and demographically uneven failure mode in I2I editing and motivate demographic-robust editing systems.

Abstract: Transformer-based single-object trackers achieve state-of-the-art accuracy but rely on fixed-depth inference, executing the full encoder--decoder stack for every frame regardless of visual complexity, thereby incurring unnecessary computational cost in long video sequences dominated by temporally coherent frames. We propose UncL-STARK, an architecture-preserving approach that enables dynamic, uncertainty-aware depth adaptation in transformer-based trackers without modifying the underlying network or adding auxiliary heads. The model is fine-tuned to retain predictive robustness at multiple intermediate depths using random-depth training with knowledge distillation, thus enabling safe inference-time truncation. At runtime, we derive a lightweight uncertainty estimate directly from the model's corner localization heatmaps and use it in a feedback-driven policy that selects the encoder and decoder depth for the next frame based on the prediction confidence by exploiting temporal coherence in video. Extensive experiments on GOT-10k and LaSOT demonstrate up to 12\% GFLOPs reduction, 8.9\% latency reduction, and 10.8\% energy savings while maintaining tracking accuracy within 0.2\% of the full-depth baseline across both short-term and long-term sequences.

Abstract: Large-scale video repositories are increasingly available for modern video understanding and generation tasks. However, transforming raw videos into high-quality, task-specific datasets remains costly and inefficient. We present DataCube, an intelligent platform for automatic video processing, multi-dimensional profiling, and query-driven retrieval. DataCube constructs structured semantic representations of video clips and supports hybrid retrieval with neural re-ranking and deep semantic matching. Through an interactive web interface, users can efficiently construct customized video subsets from massive repositories for training, analysis, and evaluation, and build searchable systems over their own private video collections. The system is publicly accessible at https://datacube.baai.ac.cn/.

Abstract: We propose EasyControlEdge, adapting an image-generation foundation model to edge detection. In real-world edge detection (e.g., floor-plan walls, satellite roads/buildings, and medical organ boundaries), crispness and data efficiency are crucial, yet producing crisp raw edge maps with limited training samples remains challenging. Although image-generation foundation models perform well on many downstream tasks, their pretrained priors for data-efficient transfer and iterative refinement for high-frequency detail preservation remain underexploited for edge detection. To enable crisp and data-efficient edge detection using these capabilities, we introduce an edge-specialized adaptation of image-generation foundation models. To better specialize the foundation model for edge detection, we incorporate an edge-oriented objective with an efficient pixel-space loss. At inference, we introduce guidance based on unconditional dynamics, enabling a single model to control the edge density through a guidance scale. Experiments on BSDS500, NYUDv2, BIPED, and CubiCasa compare against state-of-the-art methods and show consistent gains, particularly under no-post-processing crispness evaluation and with limited training data.

Abstract: Multimodal fusion frameworks, which integrate diverse medical imaging modalities (e.g., MRI, CT), have shown great potential in applications such as skin cancer detection, dementia diagnosis, and brain tumor prediction. However, existing multimodal fusion methods face significant challenges. First, they often rely on computationally expensive models, limiting their applicability in low-resource environments. Second, they often employ cascaded attention modules, which potentially increase risk of information loss during inter-module transitions and hinder their capacity to effectively capture robust shared representations across modalities. This restricts their generalization in multi-disease analysis tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hybrid Parallel-Fusion Cascaded Attention Network (HyPCA-Net), composed of two core novel blocks: (a) a computationally efficient residual adaptive learning attention block for capturing refined modality-specific representations, and (b) a dual-view cascaded attention block aimed at learning robust shared representations across diverse modalities. Extensive experiments on ten publicly available datasets exhibit that HyPCA-Net significantly outperforms existing leading methods, with improvements of up to 5.2% in performance and reductions of up to 73.1% in computational cost.

Abstract: Self-supervised pretraining has transformed computer vision by enabling data-efficient fine-tuning, yet high-resolution training typically requires server-scale infrastructure, limiting in-domain foundation model development for many research laboratories. Masked Autoencoders (MAE) reduce computation by encoding only visible tokens, but combining MAE with hierarchical downsampling architectures remains structurally challenging due to dense grid priors and mask-aware design compromises. We introduce AFFMAE, a masking-friendly hierarchical pretraining framework built on adaptive, off-grid token merging. By discarding masked tokens and performing dynamic merging exclusively over visible tokens, AFFMAE removes dense-grid assumptions while preserving hierarchical scalability. We developed numerically stable mixed-precision Flash-style cluster attention kernels, and mitigate sparse-stage representation collapse via deep supervision. On high-resolution electron microscopy segmentation, AFFMAE matches ViT-MAE performance at equal parameter count while reducing FLOPs by up to 7x, halving memory usage, and achieving faster training on a single RTX 5090.

Abstract: Eyeframe lens tracing is an important process in the optical industry that requires sub-millimeter precision to ensure proper lens fitting and optimal vision correction. Traditional frame tracers rely on mechanical tools that need precise positioning and calibration, which are time-consuming and require additional equipment, creating an inefficient workflow for opticians. This work presents a novel approach based on artificial vision that utilizes multi-view information. The proposed algorithm operates on images captured from an InVision system. The full pipeline includes image acquisition, frame segmentation to isolate the eyeframe from background, depth estimation to obtain 3D spatial information, and multi-view processing that integrates segmented RGB images with depth data for precise frame contour measurement. To this end, different configurations and variants are proposed and analyzed on real data, providing competitive measurements from still color images with respect to other solutions, while eliminating the need for specialized tracing equipment and reducing workflow complexity for optical technicians.

Abstract: In the fast-evolving field of artificial intelligence, where models are increasingly growing in complexity and size, the availability of labeled data for training deep learning models has become a significant challenge. Addressing complex problems like object detection demands considerable time and resources for data labeling to achieve meaningful results. For companies developing such applications, this entails extensive investment in highly skilled personnel or costly outsourcing. This research work aims to demonstrate that enhancing feature extractors can substantially alleviate this challenge, enabling models to learn more effective representations with less labeled data. Utilizing a self-supervised learning strategy, we present a model trained on unlabeled data that outperforms state-of-the-art feature extractors pre-trained on ImageNet and particularly designed for object detection tasks. Moreover, the results demonstrate that our approach encourages the model to focus on the most relevant aspects of an object, thus achieving better feature representations and, therefore, reinforcing its reliability and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的空中视觉-惯性系统标定方法依赖专用标定操作或人工地面控制点，这在实际长期部署中成本高且不实用。需要一种能自动利用现有地理空间数据持续修正标定参数的方法。

Method: 通过将空中图像与公开可用的正射影像和高程模型导出的2D-3D对应关系对齐，同时估计内参和外参参数。使用地理参考卫星图像作为全局参考来检测和修正标定退化。

Result: 在六个大规模空中任务上测试，涵盖两年不同季节和环境条件。与现有方法相比（Kalibr、COLMAP、VINS-Mono），SCAR显著减少了中值重投影误差，并将标定改进转化为更低的视觉定位旋转误差和更高的位姿精度。

Conclusion: SCAR能够在无需人工干预的情况下，为长期空中操作提供准确、稳健且可重复的标定。这种方法通过利用外部地理空间数据实现了自主的标定精化。

Abstract: We introduce SCAR, a method for long-term auto-calibration refinement of aerial visual-inertial systems that exploits georeferenced satellite imagery as a persistent global reference. SCAR estimates both intrinsic and extrinsic parameters by aligning aerial images with 2D--3D correspondences derived from publicly available orthophotos and elevation models. In contrast to existing approaches that rely on dedicated calibration maneuvers or manually surveyed ground control points, our method leverages external geospatial data to detect and correct calibration degradation under field deployment conditions. We evaluate our approach on six large-scale aerial campaigns conducted over two years under diverse seasonal and environmental conditions. Across all sequences, SCAR consistently outperforms established baselines (Kalibr, COLMAP, VINS-Mono), reducing median reprojection error by a large margin, and translating these calibration gains into substantially lower visual localization rotation errors and higher pose accuracy. These results demonstrate that SCAR provides accurate, robust, and reproducible calibration over long-term aerial operations without the need for manual intervention.

Abstract: In indoor assistive perception for visually impaired users, 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) is expected to provide structurally coherent and semantically consistent occupancy under strictly monocular vision for safety-critical scene understanding. However, existing monocular SSC approaches often lack explicit modeling of voxel-feature reliability and regulated cross-scale information propagation during 2D-3D projection and multi-scale fusion, making them vulnerable to projection diffusion and feature entanglement and thus limiting structural stability.To address these challenges, this paper presents an Adaptive Multi-scale Attention Aggregation (AMAA) framework built upon the MonoScene pipeline. Rather than introducing a heavier backbone, AMAA focuses on reliability-oriented feature regulation within a monocular SSC framework. Specifically, lifted voxel features are jointly calibrated in semantic and spatial dimensions through parallel channel-spatial attention aggregation, while multi-scale encoder-decoder fusion is stabilized via a hierarchical adaptive feature-gating strategy that regulates information injection across scales.Experiments on the NYUv2 benchmark demonstrate consistent improvements over MonoScene without significantly increasing system complexity: AMAA achieves 27.25% SSC mIoU (+0.31) and 43.10% SC IoU (+0.59). In addition, system-level deployment on an NVIDIA Jetson platform verifies that the complete AMAA framework can be executed stably on embedded hardware. Overall, AMAA improves monocular SSC quality and provides a reliable and deployable perception framework for indoor assistive systems targeting visually impaired users.

Abstract: While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable success across a wide range of tasks, long-form video understanding remains a significant challenge. In this study, we focus on video understanding by MLLMs. This task is challenging because processing a full stream of RGB frames is computationally intractable and highly redundant, as self-attention have quadratic complexity with sequence length. In this paper, we propose ReMoRa, a video MLLM that processes videos by operating directly on their compressed representations. A sparse set of RGB keyframes is retained for appearance, while temporal dynamics are encoded as a motion representation, removing the need for sequential RGB frames. These motion representations act as a compact proxy for optical flow, capturing temporal dynamics without full frame decoding. To refine the noise and low fidelity of block-based motions, we introduce a module to denoise and generate a fine-grained motion representation. Furthermore, our model compresses these features in a way that scales linearly with sequence length. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ReMoRa through extensive experiments across a comprehensive suite of long-video understanding benchmarks. ReMoRa outperformed baseline methods on multiple challenging benchmarks, including LongVideoBench, NExT-QA, and MLVU.

Abstract: While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities for reasoning and self-correction at the textual level, these strengths provide minimal benefits for complex tasks centered on visual perception, such as Chart Parsing. Existing models often struggle with visually dense charts, leading to errors like data omission, misalignment, and hallucination. Inspired by the human strategy of using a finger as a ``visual anchor'' to ensure accuracy when reading complex charts, we propose a new paradigm named Visual Self-Refine (VSR). The core idea of VSR is to enable a model to generate pixel-level localization outputs, visualize them, and then feed these visualizations back to itself, allowing it to intuitively inspect and correct its own potential visual perception errors. We instantiate the VSR paradigm in the domain of Chart Parsing by proposing ChartVSR. This model decomposes the parsing process into two stages: a Refine Stage, where it iteratively uses visual feedback to ensure the accuracy of all data points' Pixel-level Localizations, and a Decode Stage, where it uses these verified localizations as precise visual anchors to parse the final structured data. To address the limitations of existing benchmarks, we also construct ChartP-Bench, a new and highly challenging benchmark for chart parsing. Our work also highlights VSR as a general-purpose visual feedback mechanism, offering a promising new direction for enhancing accuracy on a wide range of vision-centric tasks.

Abstract: Long-horizon multimodal agents depend on external memory; however, similarity-based retrieval often surfaces stale, low-credibility, or conflicting items, which can trigger overconfident errors. We propose Multimodal Memory Agent (MMA), which assigns each retrieved memory item a dynamic reliability score by combining source credibility, temporal decay, and conflict-aware network consensus, and uses this signal to reweight evidence and abstain when support is insufficient. We also introduce MMA-Bench, a programmatically generated benchmark for belief dynamics with controlled speaker reliability and structured text-vision contradictions. Using this framework, we uncover the "Visual Placebo Effect", revealing how RAG-based agents inherit latent visual biases from foundation models. On FEVER, MMA matches baseline accuracy while reducing variance by 35.2% and improving selective utility; on LoCoMo, a safety-oriented configuration improves actionable accuracy and reduces wrong answers; on MMA-Bench, MMA reaches 41.18% Type-B accuracy in Vision mode, while the baseline collapses to 0.0% under the same protocol.

Abstract: Object detection models are critical components of automated systems, such as autonomous vehicles and perception-based robots, but their sensitivity to adversarial attacks poses a serious security risk. Progress in defending these models lags behind classification, hindered by a lack of standardized evaluation. It is nearly impossible to thoroughly compare attack or defense methods, as existing work uses different datasets, inconsistent efficiency metrics, and varied measures of perturbation cost. This paper addresses this gap by investigating three key questions: (1) How can we create a fair benchmark to impartially compare attacks? (2) How well do modern attacks transfer across different architectures, especially from Convolutional Neural Networks to Vision Transformers? (3) What is the most effective adversarial training strategy for robust defense? To answer these, we first propose a unified benchmark framework focused on digital, non-patch-based attacks. This framework introduces specific metrics to disentangle localization and classification errors and evaluates attack cost using multiple perceptual metrics. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art attacks and a wide range of detectors. Our findings reveal two major conclusions: first, modern adversarial attacks against object detection models show a significant lack of transferability to transformer-based architectures. Second, we demonstrate that the most robust adversarial training strategy leverages a dataset composed of a mix of high-perturbation attacks with different objectives (e.g., spatial and semantic), which outperforms training on any single attack.

Abstract: Recent advances in garment pattern generation have shown promising progress. However, existing feed-forward methods struggle with diverse poses and viewpoints, while optimization-based approaches are computationally expensive and difficult to scale. This paper focuses on sewing pattern generation for garment modeling and fabrication applications that demand editable, separable, and simulation-ready garments. We propose DressWild, a novel feed-forward pipeline that reconstructs physics-consistent 2D sewing patterns and the corresponding 3D garments from a single in-the-wild image. Given an input image, our method leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to normalize pose variations at the image level, then extract pose-aware, 3D-informed garment features. These features are fused through a transformer-based encoder and subsequently used to predict sewing pattern parameters, which can be directly applied to physical simulation, texture synthesis, and multi-layer virtual try-on. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach robustly recovers diverse sewing patterns and the corresponding 3D garments from in-the-wild images without requiring multi-view inputs or iterative optimization, offering an efficient and scalable solution for realistic garment simulation and animation.

Abstract: Video recognition models are typically trained on fixed taxonomies which are often too coarse, collapsing distinctions in object, manner or outcome under a single label. As tasks and definitions evolve, such models cannot accommodate emerging distinctions and collecting new annotations and retraining to accommodate such changes is costly. To address these challenges, we introduce category splitting, a new task where an existing classifier is edited to refine a coarse category into finer subcategories, while preserving accuracy elsewhere. We propose a zero-shot editing method that leverages the latent compositional structure of video classifiers to expose fine-grained distinctions without additional data. We further show that low-shot fine-tuning, while simple, is highly effective and benefits from our zero-shot initialization. Experiments on our new video benchmarks for category splitting demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms vision-language baselines, improving accuracy on the newly split categories without sacrificing performance on the rest.

Abstract: Face morphing attacks are widely recognized as one of the most challenging threats to face recognition systems used in electronic identity documents. These attacks exploit a critical vulnerability in passport enrollment procedures adopted by many countries, where the facial image is often acquired without a supervised live capture process. In this paper, we propose a novel face morphing technique based on Arc2Face, an identity-conditioned face foundation model capable of synthesizing photorealistic facial images from compact identity representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by comparing the morphing attack potential metric on two large-scale sequestered face morphing attack detection datasets against several state-of-the-art morphing methods, as well as on two novel morphed face datasets derived from FEI and ONOT. Experimental results show that the proposed deep learning-based approach achieves a morphing attack potential comparable to that of landmark-based techniques, which have traditionally been regarded as the most challenging. These findings confirm the ability of the proposed method to effectively preserve and manage identity information during the morph generation process.

Conclusion: CLIP-MHAdapter以轻量级架构有效提升了CLIP在复杂街道场景中的细粒度属性分类性能，为相关应用提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: Street-view image attribute classification is a vital downstream task of image classification, enabling applications such as autonomous driving, urban analytics, and high-definition map construction. It remains computationally demanding whether training from scratch, initialising from pre-trained weights, or fine-tuning large models. Although pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP offer rich image representations, existing adaptation or fine-tuning methods often rely on their global image embeddings, limiting their ability to capture fine-grained, localised attributes essential in complex, cluttered street scenes. To address this, we propose CLIP-MHAdapter, a variant of the current lightweight CLIP adaptation paradigm that appends a bottleneck MLP equipped with multi-head self-attention operating on patch tokens to model inter-patch dependencies. With approximately 1.4 million trainable parameters, CLIP-MHAdapter achieves superior or competitive accuracy across eight attribute classification tasks on the Global StreetScapes dataset, attaining new state-of-the-art results while maintaining low computational cost. The code is available at https://github.com/SpaceTimeLab/CLIP-MHAdapter.

Abstract: Adversarial diffusion and diffusion-inversion methods have advanced unpaired image-to-image translation, but each faces key limitations. Adversarial approaches require target-domain adversarial loss during training, which can limit generalization to unseen data, while diffusion-inversion methods often produce low-fidelity translations due to imperfect inversion into noise-latent representations. In this work, we propose the Self-Supervised Semantic Bridge (SSB), a versatile framework that integrates external semantic priors into diffusion bridge models to enable spatially faithful translation without cross-domain supervision. Our key idea is to leverage self-supervised visual encoders to learn representations that are invariant to appearance changes but capture geometric structure, forming a shared latent space that conditions the diffusion bridges. Extensive experiments show that SSB outperforms strong prior methods for challenging medical image synthesis in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings, and extends easily to high-quality text-guided editing.

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps are crucial to autonomous driving, providing structured representations of road elements to support navigation and planning. However, existing query-based methods often employ random query initialization and depend on implicit temporal modeling, which lead to temporal inconsistencies and instabilities during the construction of a global map. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel end-to-end framework for consistent online HD vectorized map construction, which jointly performs map instance tracking and short-term prediction. First, we propose a Semantic-Aware Query Generator that initializes queries with spatially aligned semantic masks to capture scene-level context globally. Next, we design a History Rasterized Map Memory to store fine-grained instance-level maps for each tracked instance, enabling explicit historical priors. A History-Map Guidance Module then integrates rasterized map information into track queries, improving temporal continuity. Finally, we propose a Short-Term Future Guidance module to forecast the immediate motion of map instances based on the stored history trajectories. These predicted future locations serve as hints for tracked instances to further avoid implausible predictions and keep temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods with good efficiency.

Abstract: Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) requires identifying both immediate Point Anomalies and long-range Context Anomalies. However, existing foundation models face a fundamental trade-off: 1D temporal models provide fine-grained pointwise localization but lack a global contextual perspective, while 2D vision-based models capture global patterns but suffer from information bottlenecks due to a lack of temporal alignment and coarse-grained pointwise detection. To resolve this dilemma, we propose VETime, the first TSAD framework that unifies temporal and visual modalities through fine-grained visual-temporal alignment and dynamic fusion. VETime introduces a Reversible Image Conversion and a Patch-Level Temporal Alignment module to establish a shared visual-temporal timeline, preserving discriminative details while maintaining temporal sensitivity. Furthermore, we design an Anomaly Window Contrastive Learning mechanism and a Task-Adaptive Multi-Modal Fusion to adaptively integrate the complementary perceptual strengths of both modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VETime significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in zero-shot scenarios, achieving superior localization precision with lower computational overhead than current vision-based approaches.

Abstract: A core aspect of human perception is situated awareness, the ability to relate ourselves to the surrounding physical environment and reason over possible actions in context. However, most existing benchmarks for multimodal foundation models (MFMs) emphasize environment-centric spatial relations (relations among objects in a scene), while largely overlooking observer-centric relationships that require reasoning relative to agent's viewpoint, pose, and motion. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAW-Bench (Situated Awareness in the Real World), a novel benchmark for evaluating egocentric situated awareness using real-world videos. SAW-Bench comprises 786 self-recorded videos captured with Ray-Ban Meta (Gen 2) smart glasses spanning diverse indoor and outdoor environments, and over 2,071 human-annotated question-answer pairs. It probes a model's observer-centric understanding with six different awareness tasks. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals a human-model performance gap of 37.66%, even with the best-performing MFM, Gemini 3 Flash. Beyond this gap, our in-depth analysis uncovers several notable findings; for example, while models can exploit partial geometric cues in egocentric videos, they often fail to infer a coherent camera geometry, leading to systematic spatial reasoning errors. We position SAW-Bench as a benchmark for situated spatial intelligence, moving beyond passive observation to understanding physically grounded, observer-centric dynamics.

Abstract: Compositional generalization, the ability to reason about novel combinations of familiar concepts, is fundamental to human cognition and a critical challenge for machine learning. Object-centric (OC) representations, which encode a scene as a set of objects, are often argued to support such generalization, but systematic evidence in visually rich settings is limited. We introduce a Visual Question Answering benchmark across three controlled visual worlds (CLEVRTex, Super-CLEVR, and MOVi-C) to measure how well vision encoders, with and without object-centric biases, generalize to unseen combinations of object properties. To ensure a fair and comprehensive comparison, we carefully account for training data diversity, sample size, representation size, downstream model capacity, and compute. We use DINOv2 and SigLIP2, two widely used vision encoders, as the foundation models and their OC counterparts. Our key findings reveal that (1) OC approaches are superior in harder compositional generalization settings; (2) original dense representations surpass OC only on easier settings and typically require substantially more downstream compute; and (3) OC models are more sample efficient, achieving stronger generalization with fewer images, whereas dense encoders catch up or surpass them only with sufficient data and diversity. Overall, object-centric representations offer stronger compositional generalization when any one of dataset size, training data diversity, or downstream compute is constrained.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) aim to reason by jointly leveraging visual and textual modalities. While allocating additional inference-time computation has proven effective for large language models (LLMs), achieving similar scaling in VLMs remains challenging. A key obstacle is that visual inputs are typically provided only once at the start of generation, while textual reasoning (e.g., early visual summaries) is generated autoregressively, causing reasoning to become increasingly text-dominated and allowing early visual grounding errors to accumulate. Moreover, vanilla guidance for visual grounding during inference is often coarse and noisy, making it difficult to steer reasoning over long texts. To address these challenges, we propose \emph{Saliency-Aware Principle} (SAP) selection. SAP operates on high-level reasoning principles rather than token-level trajectories, which enable stable control over discrete generation under noisy feedback while allowing later reasoning steps to re-consult visual evidence when renewed grounding is required. In addition, SAP supports multi-route inference, enabling parallel exploration of diverse reasoning behaviors. SAP is model-agnostic and data-free, requiring no additional training. Empirical results show that SAP achieves competitive performance, especially in reducing object hallucination, under comparable token-generation budgets while yielding more stable reasoning and lower response latency than CoT-style long sequential reasoning.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have recently demonstrated impressive performance for video compression. However, since a separate INR must be overfit for each video, scaling to high-resolution videos while maintaining encoding efficiency remains a significant challenge. Hypernetwork-based approaches predict INR weights (hyponetworks) for unseen videos at high speeds, but with low quality, large compressed size, and prohibitive memory needs at higher resolutions. We address these fundamental limitations through three key contributions: (1) an approach that decomposes the weight prediction task spatially and temporally, by breaking short video segments into patch tubelets, to reduce the pretraining memory overhead by 20$\times$; (2) a residual-based storage scheme that captures only differences between consecutive segment representations, significantly reducing bitstream size; and (3) a temporal coherence regularization framework that encourages changes in the weight space to be correlated with video content. Our proposed method, TeCoNeRV, achieves substantial improvements of 2.47dB and 5.35dB PSNR over the baseline at 480p and 720p on UVG, with 36% lower bitrates and 1.5-3$\times$ faster encoding speeds. With our low memory usage, we are the first hypernetwork approach to demonstrate results at 480p, 720p and 1080p on UVG, HEVC and MCL-JCV.

Abstract: This article defines multi-twisted Goppa (MTG) codes as subfield subcodes of duals of multi-twisted Reed-Solomon (MTRS) codes and examines their properties. We show that if $t$ is the degree of the MTG polynomial defining an MTG code, its minimum distance is at least $t + 1$ under certain conditions. Extending earlier methods limited to single twist at last position, we use the extended Euclidean algorithm to efficiently decode MTG codes with a single twist at any position, correcting up to $\left\lfloor \tfrac{t}{2} \right\rfloor$ errors. This decoding method highlights the practical potential of these codes within the Niederreiter public key cryptosystem (PKC). Furthermore, we establish that the Niederreiter PKC based on MTG codes is secure against partial key recovery attacks. Additionally, we also reduce the public key size by constructing quasi-cyclic MTG codes using a non-trivial automorphism group.

Abstract: This paper proposes a scalable Bayesian optimization (BO) framework for dense base-station (BS) configuration design. BO can find an optimal BS configuration by iterating parameter search, channel simulation, and probabilistic modeling of the objective function. However, its performance is severely affected by the curse of dimensionality, thereby reducing its scalability. To overcome this limitation, the proposed method sequentially optimizes per-BS parameters based on block coordinate descent while fixing the remaining BS configurations, thereby reducing the effective dimensionality of each optimization step. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms naive optimization in dense deployment scenarios.

Abstract: This paper extends the foundational work of Dollma \emph{et al}. on codes for ordered composite DNA sequences. We consider the general setting with an alphabet of size $q$ and a resolution parameter $k$, moving beyond the binary ($q=2$) case primarily studied previously. We investigate error-correcting codes for substitution errors and deletion errors under several channel models, including $(e_1,\ldots,e_k)$-composite error/deletion, $e$-composite error/deletion, and the newly introduced $t$-$(e_1,\ldots,e_t)$-composite error/deletion model.
  We first establish equivalence relations among families of composite-error correcting codes (CECCs) and among families of composite-deletion correcting codes (CDCCs). This significantly reduces the number of distinct error-parameter sets that require separate analysis. We then derive novel and general upper bounds on the sizes of CECCs using refined sphere-packing arguments and probabilistic methods. These bounds together cover all values of parameters $q$, $k$, $(e_1,\ldots,e_k)$ and $e$. In contrast, previous bounds were only established for $q=2$ and limited choices of $k$, $(e_1,\ldots,e_k)$ and $e$. For CDCCs, we generalize a known non-asymptotic upper bound for $(1,0,\ldots,0)$-CDCCs and then provide a cleaner asymptotic bound.
  On the constructive side, for any $q\ge2$, we propose $(1,0,\ldots,0)$-CDCCs, $1$-CDCCs and $t$-$(1,\ldots,1)$-CDCCs with near-optimal redundancies. These codes have efficient and systematic encoders. For substitution errors, we design the first explicit encoding and decoding algorithms for the binary $(1,0,\ldots,0)$-CECC constructed by Dollma \emph{et al}, and extend the approach to general $q$. Furthermore, we give an improved construction of binary $1$-CECCs, a construction of nonbinary $1$-CECCs, and a construction of $t$-$(1,\ldots,1)$-CECCs. These constructions are also systematic.

Abstract: Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) enables ultra-low-power connectivity by allowing passive backscatter devices (BDs) to convey information through reflection of ambient signals. However, the cascaded AmBC channel suffers from severe double path loss and multiplicative fading, while accurate channel state information (CSI) acquisition is highly challenging due to the weak backscattered signal and the resource-limited nature of BDs. To address these challenges, this paper considers an AmBC system in which the reader is equipped with a pixel-based fluid antenna system (FAS). By dynamically selecting one antenna position from a dense set of pixels within a compact aperture, the FAS-enabled reader exploits spatial diversity through measurement-driven port selection, without requiring explicit CSI acquisition or multiple RF chains. The intrinsic rate-energy tradeoff at the BD is also incorporated by jointly optimizing the backscatter modulation coefficient under an energy harvesting (EH) neutrality constraint. To efficiently solve this problem, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based framework is developed to jointly determine the FAS port selection and modulation coefficient on an optimize-then-average (OTA) basis. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the achievable rate compared with conventional single-antenna readers, with gains preserved under imperfect observations, stringent EH constraints, and different pixel spacings.

Abstract: In this letter, we develop a continuous fluid antenna (FA) framework for uplink channel estimation in cell-free massive multiple-input and multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) systems. By modeling the wireless channel as a spatially correlated Gaussian random field, channel estimation is formulated as a Gaussian process (GP) regression problem with motion-constrained spatial sampling. Closed-form expressions for the linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) estimator and the corresponding estimation error are derived. A fundamental comparison with discrete port-based architectures is established under identical position constraints, showing that continuous FA sampling achieves equal or lower estimation error for any finite pilot budget, with strict improvement for non-degenerate spatial correlation models. Numerical results validate the analysis and show the performance gains of continuous FA sampling over discrete baselines.

Abstract: The Ingleton inequality is a classical linear information inequality that holds for representable matroids but fails to be universally valid for entropic vectors. Understanding the extent to which this inequality can be violated has been a longstanding problem in information theory. In this paper, we show that for a broad class
  of jointly distributed random variables $(X,Y)$ the Ingleton inequality holds up to a small additive error, even even though the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ is far from being extractable. Contrary to common intuition, strongly non-extractable mutual information does not lead to large violations of the Ingleton inequality in this setting. More precisely, we consider pairs $(X,Y)$ that are uniformly distributed on their joint support and whose associated biregular bipartite graph is an expander. For all auxiliary random variables $A$ and $B$ jointly distributed with $(X,Y)$, we establish a lower bound on the Ingleton quantity $I(X:Y | A) + I(X:Y | B) + I(A:B) - I(X:Y)$ in terms of the spectral parameters of the underlying graph. Our proof combines the expander mixing lemma with a partitioning technique for finite sets.

Abstract: In symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR), a user communicates with multiple servers to retrieve from them a message in a database, while not revealing the message index to any individual server (user privacy), and learning no additional information about the database (database privacy). We study the problem of SPIR on graph-replicated database systems, where each node of the graph represents a server and each link represents a message. Each message is replicated at exactly two servers; those at which the link representing the message is incident. To ensure database privacy, the servers share a set of common randomness, independent of the database and the user's desired message index. We study two cases of common randomness distribution to the servers: i) graph-replicated common randomness, and ii) fully-replicated common randomness. Given a graph-replicated database system, in i), we assign one randomness variable independently to every pair of servers sharing a message, while in ii), we assign an identical set of randomness variable to all servers, irrespective of the underlying graph. In both settings, our goal is to characterize the SPIR capacity, i.e., the maximum number of desired message symbols retrieved per downloaded symbol, and quantify the minimum amount of common randomness required to achieve the capacity. To this goal, in setting i), we derive a general lower bound on the SPIR capacity, and show it to be tight for path and regular graphs through a matching converse. Moreover, we establish that the minimum size of common randomness required for SPIR is equal to the message size. In setting ii), the SPIR capacity improves over the first, more restrictive setting. We show this through capacity lower bounds for a class of graphs, by constructing SPIR schemes from PIR schemes.

Abstract: Open Web 3.0 platforms increasingly operate as \emph{service ecosystems} (e.g., DeFi, DAOs, and decentralized social applications) where \emph{admission control} and \emph{account provisioning} must be delivered as an always-on service under bursty demand. Service operators face a fundamental tension: enforcing Sybil resistance (one-person-one-account) while preserving user privacy, yet keeping on-chain verification cost and admission latency predictable at scale. Existing credential-based ZK admission approaches typically require per-request on-chain verification, making the provisioning cost grow with the number of concurrent joiners. We present \textbf{ZK-AMS}, a scalable admission and provisioning layer that bridges real-world \emph{Personhood Credentials} to anonymous on-chain service accounts. ZK-AMS combines (i) zero-knowledge credential validation, (ii) a \emph{permissionless} batch submitter model, and (iii) a decentralized, privacy-preserving folding pipeline that uses Nova-style recursive aggregation together with multi-key homomorphic encryption, enabling batch settlement with \emph{constant} on-chain verification per batch. We implement ZK-AMS end-to-end on an Ethereum testbed and evaluate admission throughput, end-to-end latency, and gas consumption. Results show stable verification cost across batch sizes and substantially improved admission efficiency over non-recursive baselines, providing a practical and cost-predictable admission service for large-scale Web 3.0 communities.

Abstract: Future vehicular networks require continuous connectivity to serve highly mobile users in urban environments. To mitigate the coverage limitations of fixed terrestrial macro base stations (MBS) under non line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions, fleets of unmanned aerial base stations (UABSs) can be deployed as aerial base stations, dynamically repositioning to track vehicular users and traffic hotspots in coordination with the terrestrial network. This paper addresses cooperative multi-agent trajectory design under different service areas and takeoff configurations, where rapid and safe adaptation across scenarios is essential. We formulate the problem as a multi-task decentralized partially observable Markov decision process and solve it using centralized training and decentralized execution with double dueling deep Q-network (3DQN), enabling online training for real-world deployments. However, efficient exploration remains a bottleneck, with conventional strategies like $ε$-greedy requiring careful tuning. To overcome this, we propose the multi-agent meta-advisor with advisor override (MAMO). This framework guides agent exploration through a meta-policy learned jointly across tasks. It uses a dynamic override mechanism that allows agents to reject misaligned guidance when the advisor fails to generalize to a specific scenario. Simulation results across three realistic urban scenarios and multiple takeoff configurations show that MAMO achieves faster convergence and higher returns than tuned $ε$-greedy baselines, outperforming both an advisor-only ablation and a single generalized policy. Finally, we demonstrate that the learned UABS fleet significantly improves network performance compared to deployments without aerial support.

TL;DR: 该文提出一种近似多无人机通用路径规划问题(CEMUAVGRP)，采用两阶段迭代方法：通用路径阶段和近似路径阶段，通过自适应迭代局部搜索框架优化总距离


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无人机路径规划研究大多要求精确访问节点，但对许多监控任务而言，只需到达节点附近一定范围内即可完成任务。因此，研究近似访问的多无人机通用路径规划问题具有现实意义，可降低无人机的飞行距离和能耗

Method: 提出两阶段迭代方法：1）通用路径阶段使用变邻域下降启发式算法为每个无人机规划包含所需节点和边的路径；2）近似路径阶段使用二阶锥规划优化每个节点的代表性访问点。两阶段在自适应迭代局部搜索框架下迭代执行，形成AILS-VND-SOCP算法

Result: 通过大量实验和对比研究，证明了所提算法的有效性，同时验证了使用磁盘邻域（近似访问）相比精确访问的优越性，能够显著减少总飞行距离

Conclusion: CEMUAVGRP问题和AILS-VND-SOCP算法为多无人机监控任务提供了有效的路径规划解决方案，近似访问策略比精确访问更加实用和经济

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a close-enough multi-UAV general routing problem (CEMUAVGRP) where a fleet of homogeneous UAVs conduct monitoring tasks containing nodes, each of which has its disk neighborhood, and edges, aiming to minimize the total distance. A two-phase iterative method is proposed, partitioning the CEMUAVGRP into a general routing phase where a satisfactory route including required nodes and edges for each UAV is obtained without considering the disk neighborhoods of required nodes, and a close-enough routing phase where representative points are optimized for each required node in the determined route. To be specific, a variable neighborhood descent (VND) heuristic is proposed for the general routing phase, while a second-order cone programming (SOCP) procedure is applied in the close-enough routing phase. These two phases are performed in an iterative fashion under the framework of an adaptive iterated local search (AILS) algorithm until the predefined termination criteria are satisfied. Extensive experiments and comparative studies are conducted, demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed AILS-VND-SOCP algorithm and the superiority of disk neighborhoods.

Motivation: 旨在为去中心化能源市场提供一种隐私保护、通信成本低的协调方案，避免昂贵的集中式通信基础设施

Method: 将问题建模为去中心化部分可观察马尔可夫决策过程，基于多智能体强化学习（使用PPO、APPO、SAC算法），通过系统层面的绩效指标作为信息素信号，让智能体推断全局状态

Result: APPO-DTDE配置达到理论集中式基准（CTCE）的91.7%协调分，完全去中心化方法（DTDE）降低了电网平衡方差31%，表现出更优的电网稳定性，同时发现SAC算法在去中心化环境中因熵驱动的不稳定性而失败

Conclusion: 信息素信号为复杂电网协调提供了足够信息，是一种既具有鲁棒性又保护隐私的替代方案，但在效率与稳定性之间存在重要权衡：集中式实现更强分配效率，而去中心化则提供更好的物理稳定性

Abstract: This paper proposes implicit cooperation, a framework enabling decentralized agents to approximate optimal coordination in local energy markets without explicit peer-to-peer communication. We formulate the problem as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision problem that is solved through a multi-agent reinforcement learning task in which agents use stigmergic signals (key performance indicators at the system level) to infer and react to global states. Through a 3x3 factorial design on an IEEE 34-node topology, we evaluated three training paradigms (CTCE, CTDE, DTDE) and three algorithms (PPO, APPO, SAC). Results identify APPO-DTDE as the optimal configuration, achieving a coordination score of 91.7% relative to the theoretical centralized benchmark (CTCE). However, a critical trade-off emerges between efficiency and stability: while the centralized benchmark maximizes allocative efficiency with a peer-to-peer trade ratio of 0.6, the fully decentralized approach (DTDE) demonstrates superior physical stability. Specifically, DTDE reduces the variance of grid balance by 31% compared to hybrid architectures, establishing a highly predictable, import-biased load profile that simplifies grid regulation. Furthermore, topological analysis reveals emergent spatial clustering, where decentralized agents self-organize into stable trading communities to minimize congestion penalties. While SAC excelled in hybrid settings, it failed in decentralized environments due to entropy-driven instability. This research proves that stigmergic signaling provides sufficient context for complex grid coordination, offering a robust, privacy-preserving alternative to expensive centralized communication infrastructure.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel, open-source MARL simulation framework for studying implicit cooperation in LEMs, modeled as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process and implemented as a Gymnasium environment for MARL. Our framework features a modular market platform with plug-and-play clearing mechanisms, physically constrained agent models (including battery storage), a realistic grid network, and a comprehensive analytics suite to evaluate emergent coordination. The main contribution is a novel method to foster implicit cooperation, where agents' observations and rewards are enhanced with system-level key performance indicators to enable them to independently learn strategies that benefit the entire system and aim for collectively beneficial outcomes without explicit communication. Through representative case studies (available in a dedicated GitHub repository in https://github.com/salazarna/marlem, we show the framework's ability to analyze how different market configurations (such as varying storage deployment) impact system performance. This illustrates its potential to facilitate emergent coordination, improve market efficiency, and strengthen grid stability. The proposed simulation framework is a flexible, extensible, and reproducible tool for researchers and practitioners to design, test, and validate strategies for future intelligent, decentralized energy systems.

Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of consensus tracking with fixed-time convergence, for leader-follower multi-agent systems with double-integrator dynamics, where only a subset of followers has access to the state of the leader. The control scheme is divided into two steps. The first one is dedicated to the estimation of the leader state by each follower in a distributed way and in a fixed-time. Then, based on the estimate of the leader state, each follower computes its control law to track the leader in a fixed-time. In this paper, two control strategies are investigated and compared to solve the two mentioned steps. The first one is an autonomous protocol which ensures a fixed-time convergence for the observer and for the controller parts where the Upper Bound of the Settling-Time (UBST) is set a priory by the user. Then, the previous strategy is redesigned using time-varying gains to obtain a non-autonomous protocol. This enables to obtain less conservative estimates of the UBST while guaranteeing that the time-varying gains remain bounded. Some numerical examples show the effectiveness of the proposed consensus protocols.

Motivation: 在分布式光伏发电(DG)大规模接入的背景下，如何合理分配DG单元以最大化电网效益同时保证电网安全运行成为关键问题。当前方法在同时考虑电网负荷能力和多DG单元优化配置方面存在不足。

Method: 采用两阶段方法。第一阶段通过迭代方式确定电网及各节点的附加有功负荷能力，识别高负荷能力的候选节点。第二阶段采用蒙特卡洛方法，以最小化电压偏差和减少有功损耗为目标，优化DG单元的位置和大小。

Conclusion: 该文提出的两阶段方法在分布式光伏发电单元分配方面具有显著优势，能够有效降低电网损耗、改善电压分布，同时考虑电网负荷能力限制，为实际工程应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This research paper proposes an efficient methodology for the allocation of multiple photovoltaic (PV)-based distributed generation (DG) units in the radial distribution network (RDN), while considering the loading capacity of the network. The proposed method is structured using a two-stage approach. In the first stage, the additional active power loading capacity of the network and each individual bus is determined using an iterative approach. This analysis quantifies the network's additional active loadability limits and identifies buses with high active power loading capacity, which are considered candidate nodes for the placement of DG units. Subsequently, in the second stage, the optimal locations and sizes of DG units are determined using the Monte Carlo method, with the objectives of minimizing voltage deviation and reducing active power losses in the network. The methodology is validated on the standard IEEE 33-bus RDN to determine the optimal locations and sizes of DG units. The results demonstrate that the optimal allocation of one, two, and three DG units, achieved from proposed method, reduces network active power losses by 50.37%, 58.62%, and 65.16%, respectively, and also significantly enhances the voltage profile across all buses. When the obtained results are compared with the results of several existing studies, it is found that the proposed method allows for larger DG capacities and maintains better voltage profiles throughout the RDN.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个结合非线性动力学、感知心理物理学和高频触觉渲染的统一框架，用于提升手术模拟的真实感。通过Koopman算子将手术器械与软组织交互提升到增广状态空间，实现非线性动力学的线性预测与控制；基于韦伯-费希纳和史蒂文斯标度定律的贝叶斯校准模块使渲染力信号与人类感知阈值一致。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手术模拟系统在触觉渲染的真实感和感知一致性方面存在局限，传统的弹簧阻尼器和基于能量的渲染方法无法精确模拟非线性软组织动力学，且未充分考虑人类感知特性。

Method: 1. 使用Koopman算子将非线性软组织动力学映射到线性增广状态空间，实现高效预测与控制；2. 基于韦伯-费希纳和史蒂文斯定律设计贝叶斯校准模块，根据个体感知阈值自适应调整力信号；3. 实现高频触觉渲染框架，支持触诊、切口和骨铣等多种手术任务。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了手术模拟的触觉真实感和感知一致性，对手术培训和VR医学教育具有重要价值，未来可朝向闭环神经反馈触觉接口发展。

Abstract: We introduce a unified framework that combines nonlinear dynamics, perceptual psychophysics and high frequency haptic rendering to enhance realism in surgical simulation. The interaction of the surgical device with soft tissue is elevated to an augmented state space with a Koopman operator formulation, allowing linear prediction and control of the dynamics that are nonlinear by nature. To make the rendered forces consistent with human perceptual limits, we put forward a Bayesian calibration module based on WeberFechner and Stevens scaling laws, which progressively shape force signals relative to each individual's discrimination thresholds. For various simulated surgical tasks such as palpation, incision, and bone milling, the proposed system attains an average rendering latency of 4.3 ms, a force error of less than 2.8% and a 20% improvement in perceptual discrimination. Multivariate statistical analyses (MANOVA and regression) reveal that the system's performance is significantly better than that of conventional spring-damper and energy, based rendering methods. We end by discussing the potential impact on surgical training and VR, based medical education, as well as sketching future work toward closed, loop neural feedback in haptic interfaces.

Abstract: Memes are a popular element of modern web communication, used not only as static artifacts but also as interactive replies within conversations. While computational research has focused on analyzing the intrinsic properties of memes, the dynamic and contextual use of memes to create humor remains an understudied area of web science. To address this gap, we introduce the Meme Reply Selection task and present MaMe-Re (Manga Meme Reply Benchmark), a benchmark of 100,000 human-annotated pairs (500,000 total annotations from 2,325 unique annotators) consisting of openly licensed Japanese manga panels and social media posts. Our analysis reveals three key insights: (1) large language models (LLMs) show preliminary evidence of capturing complex social cues such as exaggeration, moving beyond surface-level semantic matching; (2) the inclusion of visual information does not improve performance, revealing a gap between understanding visual content and effectively using it for contextual humor; (3) while LLMs can match human judgments in controlled settings, they struggle to distinguish subtle differences in wit among semantically similar candidates. These findings suggest that selecting contextually humorous replies remains an open challenge for current models.

Conclusion: 运行时稳定性是可靠推理在不确定性下的系统级要求，将稳定性从任务正确性重构为可检测性、有界偏离和可恢复性

Abstract: Hybrid reasoning systems that combine learned components with model-based inference are increasingly deployed in tool-augmented decision loops, yet their runtime behavior under partial observability and sustained evidence mismatch remains poorly understood. In practice, failures often arise as gradual divergence of internal reasoning dynamics rather than as isolated prediction errors. This work studies runtime stability in hybrid reasoning systems from a Kalman-inspired perspective. We model reasoning as a stochastic inference process driven by an internal innovation signal and introduce cognitive drift as a measurable runtime phenomenon. Stability is defined in terms of detectability, bounded divergence, and recoverability rather than task-level correctness. We propose a runtime stability framework that monitors innovation statistics, detects emerging instability, and triggers recovery-aware control mechanisms. Experiments on multi-step, tool-augmented reasoning tasks demonstrate reliable instability detection prior to task failure and show that recovery, when feasible, re-establishes bounded internal behavior within finite time. These results emphasize runtime stability as a system-level requirement for reliable reasoning under uncertainty.

Abstract: Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) balance predictive accuracy and interpretability, but manually configuring their structure is challenging. We propose using the multi-objective genetic algorithm NSGA-II to automatically optimize GAMs, jointly minimizing prediction error (RMSE) and a Complexity Penalty that captures sparsity, smoothness, and uncertainty. Experiments on the California Housing dataset show that NSGA-II discovers GAMs that outperform baseline LinearGAMs in accuracy or match performance with substantially lower complexity. The resulting models are simpler, smoother, and exhibit narrower confidence intervals, enhancing interpretability. This framework provides a general approach for automated optimization of transparent, high-performing models. The code can be found at https://github.com/KaaustaaubShankar/GeneticAdditiveModels.

Conclusion: IT-OSE方法在工业场景中具有有效性、稳健性和实用性，能显著提升模型性能并降低成本，增强OSS的确定性

Abstract: In industrial scenarios, data augmentation is an effective approach to improve model performance. However, its benefits are not unidirectionally beneficial. There is no theoretical research or established estimation for the optimal sample size (OSS) in augmentation, nor is there an established metric to evaluate the accuracy of OSS or its deviation from the ground truth. To address these issues, we propose an information-theoretic optimal sample size estimation (IT-OSE) to provide reliable OSS estimation for industrial data augmentation. An interval coverage and deviation (ICD) score is proposed to evaluate the estimated OSS intuitively. The relationship between OSS and dominant factors is theoretically analyzed and formulated, thereby enhancing the interpretability. Experiments show that, compared to empirical estimation, the IT-OSE increases accuracy in classification tasks across baseline models by an average of 4.38%, and reduces MAPE in regression tasks across baseline models by an average of 18.80%. The improvements in downstream model performance are more stable. ICDdev in the ICD score is also reduced by an average of 49.30%. The determinism of OSS is enhanced. Compared to exhaustive search, the IT-OSE achieves the same OSS while reducing computational and data costs by an average of 83.97% and 93.46%. Furthermore, practicality experiments demonstrate that the IT-OSE exhibits generality across representative sensor-based industrial scenarios.

Abstract: Exercise recommendation focuses on personalized exercise selection conditioned on students' learning history, personal interests, and other individualized characteristics. Despite notable progress, most existing methods represent student learning solely as exercise sequences, overlooking rich behavioral interaction information. This limited representation often leads to biased and unreliable estimates of learning progress. Moreover, fixed-length sequence segmentation limits the incorporation of early learning experiences, thereby hindering the modeling of long-term dependencies and the accurate estimation of knowledge mastery. To address these limitations, we propose BamaER, a Behavior-aware memory-augmented Exercise Recommendation framework that comprises three core modules: (i) the learning progress prediction module that captures heterogeneous student interaction behaviors via a tri-directional hybrid encoding scheme; (ii) the memory-augmented knowledge tracing module that maintains a dynamic memory matrix to jointly model historical and current knowledge states for robust mastery estimation; and (iii) the exercise filtering module that formulates candidate selection as a diversity-aware optimization problem, solved via the Hippopotamus Optimization Algorithm to reduce redundancy and improve recommendation coverage. Experiments on five real-world educational datasets show that BamaER consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a range of evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) offer a powerful paradigm for flow reconstruction, seamlessly integrating sparse velocity measurements with the governing Navier-Stokes equations to recover complete velocity and latent pressure fields. However, scaling such models to large spatiotemporal domains is hindered by computational bottlenecks and optimization instabilities. In this work, we propose a robust distributed PINNs framework designed for efficient flow reconstruction via spatiotemporal domain decomposition. A critical challenge in such distributed solvers is pressure indeterminacy, where independent sub-networks drift into inconsistent local pressure baselines. We address this issue through a reference anchor normalization strategy coupled with decoupled asymmetric weighting. By enforcing a unidirectional information flow from designated master ranks where the anchor point lies to neighboring ranks, our approach eliminates gauge freedom and guarantees global pressure uniqueness while preserving temporal continuity. Furthermore, to mitigate the Python interpreter overhead associated with computing high-order physics residuals, we implement a high-performance training pipeline accelerated by CUDA graphs and JIT compilation. Extensive validation on complex flow benchmarks demonstrates that our method achieves near-linear strong scaling and high-fidelity reconstruction, establishing a scalable and physically rigorous pathway for flow reconstruction and understanding of complex hydrodynamics.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A P300 ERP-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) speller is an assistive communication tool. It searches for the P300 event-related potential (ERP) elicited by target stimuli, distinguishing it from the neural responses to non-target stimuli embedded in electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Conventional methods require a lengthy calibration procedure to construct the binary classifier, which reduced overall efficiency. Thus, we proposed a unified framework with minimum calibration effort such that, given a small amount of labeled calibration data, we employed an adaptive semi-supervised EM-GMM algorithm to update the binary classifier. We evaluated our method based on character-level prediction accuracy, information transfer rate (ITR), and BCI utility. We applied calibration on training data and reported results on testing data. Our results indicate that, out of 15 participants, 9 participants exceed the minimum character-level accuracy of 0.7 using either on our adaptive method or the benchmark, and 7 out of these 9 participants showed that our adaptive method performed better than the benchmark. The proposed semi-supervised learning framework provides a practical and efficient alternative to improve the overall spelling efficiency in the real-time BCI speller system, particularly in contexts with limited labeled data.

Abstract: We revisit the classical problem of universal prediction of stochastic sequences with a finite time horizon $T$ known to the learner. The question we investigate is whether it is possible to derive vanishing regret bounds that hold with high probability, complementing existing bounds from the literature that hold in expectation. We propose such high-probability bounds which have a very similar form as the prior expectation bounds. For the case of universal prediction of a stochastic process over a countable alphabet, our bound states a convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/2} δ^{-1/2})$ with probability as least $1-δ$ compared to prior known in-expectation bounds of the order $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/2})$. We also propose an impossibility result which proves that it is not possible to improve the exponent of $δ$ in a bound of the same form without making additional assumptions.

TL;DR: 论文提出了R²Energy基准——一个包含中国四省902个风、光电站1070万条小时级数据的大规模NWP辅助可再生能源预测基准，采用标准化、无信息泄漏的预测范式，暴露了极端天气下模型鲁棒性差距这一关键问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着可再生能源（尤其是风能和太阳能）快速发展，可靠预测对电力系统运行至关重要。虽然深度学习模型在平均准确率上已有显著提升，但气候变化导致的极端天气事件频发加剧了对电网稳定性和运行安全的威胁，因此开发能在波动条件下保持鲁棒性的预测模型成为当务之急。

Method: 构建了大规模NWP辅助可再生能源预测基准R²Energy，包含中国四省902个风、光电站的1070万条小时级高保真记录；建立了标准化、无信息泄漏的预测范式，确保所有模型同等获取未来数值天气预报信号；引入基于专家标注极端天气事件的区域评估方法，揭示模型鲁棒性差距。

Result: 研究发现：1）平均指标掩盖了极端条件下的“鲁棒性差距”；2）在极端天气下，模型的可靠性取决于其与气象数据的融合策略，而非架构复杂性——呈现明显的鲁棒性-复杂性权衡关系。

Conclusion: R²Energy为安全关键型电力系统应用的预测模型评估与开发提供了原则性基础，揭示了传统平均指标无法反映的极端天气下模型鲁棒性问题，强调未来研究需关注气象融合策略而非单纯增加模型复杂度。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of renewable energy, particularly wind and solar power, has made reliable forecasting critical for power system operations. While recent deep learning models have achieved strong average accuracy, the increasing frequency and intensity of climate-driven extreme weather events pose severe threats to grid stability and operational security. Consequently, developing robust forecasting models that can withstand volatile conditions has become a paramount challenge. In this paper, we present R$^2$Energy, a large-scale benchmark for NWP-assisted renewable energy forecasting. It comprises over 10.7 million high-fidelity hourly records from 902 wind and solar stations across four provinces in China, providing the diverse meteorological conditions necessary to capture the wide-ranging variability of renewable generation. We further establish a standardized, leakage-free forecasting paradigm that grants all models identical access to future Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) signals, enabling fair and reproducible comparison across state-of-the-art representative forecasting architectures. Beyond aggregate accuracy, we incorporate regime-wise evaluation with expert-aligned extreme weather annotations, uncovering a critical ``robustness gap'' typically obscured by average metrics. This gap reveals a stark robustness-complexity trade-off: under extreme conditions, a model's reliability is driven by its meteorological integration strategy rather than its architectural complexity. R$^2$Energy provides a principled foundation for evaluating and developing forecasting models for safety-critical power system applications.

Motivation: 现有扩散模型迭代采样导致高推理延迟，近期的蒸馏技术通过丢弃中间轨迹步骤来加速采样，但这种稀疏监督会造成结构信息丢失和显著的离散化误差，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出B-DENSE框架，将学生模型架构修改为输出K倍扩展通道，每个通道子集对应教师模型轨迹中的特定离散中间步骤。通过训练这些分支同时映射到教师目标时间步的整个序列，实现密集中间轨迹对齐。

Conclusion: 通过多分支轨迹对齐的B-DENSE框架有效缓解了传统扩散蒸馏方法的结构信息损失和离散化误差问题，提供了高质量的图像生成加速解决方案。

Abstract: Inspired by non-equilibrium thermodynamics, diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in generative modeling. However, their iterative sampling nature results in high inference latency. While recent distillation techniques accelerate sampling, they discard intermediate trajectory steps. This sparse supervision leads to a loss of structural information and introduces significant discretization errors. To mitigate this, we propose B-DENSE, a novel framework that leverages multi-branch trajectory alignment. We modify the student architecture to output $K$-fold expanded channels, where each subset corresponds to a specific branch representing a discrete intermediate step in the teacher's trajectory. By training these branches to simultaneously map to the entire sequence of the teacher's target timesteps, we enforce dense intermediate trajectory alignment. Consequently, the student model learns to navigate the solution space from the earliest stages of training, demonstrating superior image generation quality compared to baseline distillation frameworks.

Abstract: We study a type of Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problems in which arms with a Gaussian reward feedback are clustered. Such an arm setting finds applications in many real-world problems, for example, mmWave communications and portfolio management with risky assets, as a result of the universality of the Gaussian distribution. Based on the Thompson Sampling algorithm with Gaussian prior (TSG) algorithm for the selection of the optimal arm, we propose our Thompson Sampling with Clustered arms under Gaussian prior (TSCG) specific to the 2-level hierarchical structure. We prove that by utilizing the 2-level structure, we can achieve a lower regret bound than we do with ordinary TSG. In addition, when the reward is Unimodal, we can reach an even lower bound on the regret by our Unimodal Thompson Sampling algorithm with Clustered Arms under Gaussian prior (UTSCG). Each of our proposed algorithms are accompanied by theoretical evaluation of the upper regret bound, and our numerical experiments confirm the advantage of our proposed algorithms.

TL;DR: 针对预训练流模型只能从数据分布狭窄区域采样的问题，本文提出了一种利用验证器（如原子键检查器）扩展模型采样范围的方法，在保证样本有效性的同时探索更广阔的设计空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的流和扩散模型通常在小规模数据上预训练，仅覆盖有效设计空间的有限部分（如分子空间）。这导致模型只能从可行域的狭窄区域生成样本，限制了科学发现应用中对超出数据分布的有效设计的探索能力。为解决这一根本限制，需要利用验证器来扩展预训练流模型。

Method: 提出了流扩展器（FE）方法，通过验证器约束下的熵最大化来扩展流模型的采样空间。该方法：1）定义了强验证器和弱验证器的形式化概念；2）设计了全局和局部流扩展的算法框架；3）建立了可扩展的镜像下降方案，在含噪声状态空间上实现验证器约束的熵最大化优化。

Result: 理论分析表明FE方法在理想化和一般假设下均具有收敛保证。实验评估包括可视化解释性场景和分子设计任务，显示FE能有效扩展预训练流模型，在保持样本有效性的同时显著增加构象多样性。

Conclusion: FE方法能够成功扩展预训练流模型的采样能力，使其超越有限的数据分布区域，在科学发现有广阔应用前景。该方法为解决模型生成样本多样性受限的问题提供了有效的算法框架。

Abstract: Flow and diffusion models are typically pre-trained on limited available data (e.g., molecular samples), covering only a fraction of the valid design space (e.g., the full molecular space). As a consequence, they tend to generate samples from only a narrow portion of the feasible domain. This is a fundamental limitation for scientific discovery applications, where one typically aims to sample valid designs beyond the available data distribution. To this end, we address the challenge of leveraging access to a verifier (e.g., an atomic bonds checker), to adapt a pre-trained flow model so that its induced density expands beyond regions of high data availability, while preserving samples validity. We introduce formal notions of strong and weak verifiers and propose algorithmic frameworks for global and local flow expansion via probability-space optimization. Then, we present Flow Expander (FE), a scalable mirror descent scheme that provably tackles both problems by verifier-constrained entropy maximization over the flow process noised state space. Next, we provide a thorough theoretical analysis of the proposed method, and state convergence guarantees under both idealized and general assumptions. Ultimately, we empirically evaluate our method on both illustrative, yet visually interpretable settings, and on a molecular design task showcasing the ability of FE to expand a pre-trained flow model increasing conformer diversity while preserving validity.

Abstract: Capability emergence during neural network training remains mechanistically opaque. We track five geometric measures across five model scales (405K-85M parameters), 120+ emergence events in eight algorithmic tasks, and three Pythia language models (160M-2.8B). We find: (1) training begins with a universal representation collapse to task-specific floors that are scale-invariant across a 210X parameter range (e.g., modular arithmetic collapses to RANKME ~ 2.0 regardless of model size); (2) collapse propagates top-down through layers (32/32 task X model consistency), contradicting bottom-up feature-building intuition; (3) a geometric hierarchy in which representation geometry leads emergence (75-100% precursor rate for hard tasks), while the local learning coefficient is synchronous (0/24 precursor) and Hessian measures lag. We also delineate prediction limits: geometric measures encode coarse task difficulty but not fine-grained timing (within-class concordance 27%; when task ordering reverses across scales, prediction fails at 26%). On Pythia, global geometric patterns replicate but per-task precursor signals do not -- the precursor relationship requires task-training alignment that naturalistic pre-training does not provide. Our contribution is the geometric anatomy of emergence and its boundary conditions, not a prediction tool.

Abstract: Conformal prediction provides distribution-free coverage guaranties for regression; yet existing methods assume Euclidean output spaces and produce prediction regions that are poorly calibrated when responses lie on Riemannian manifolds. We propose \emph{adaptive geodesic conformal prediction}, a framework that replaces Euclidean residuals with geodesic nonconformity scores and normalizes them by a cross-validated difficulty estimator to handle heteroscedastic noise. The resulting prediction regions, geodesic caps on the sphere, have position-independent area and adapt their size to local prediction difficulty, yielding substantially more uniform conditional coverage than non-adaptive alternatives. In a synthetic sphere experiment with strong heteroscedasticity and a real-world geomagnetic field forecasting task derived from IGRF-14 satellite data, the adaptive method markedly reduces conditional coverage variability and raises worst-case coverage much closer to the nominal level, while coordinate-based baselines waste a large fraction of coverage area due to chart distortion.

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) continues its rapid expansion, the environmental cost of model training and inference has become a critical societal concern. Existing benchmarks overwhelmingly focus on standard performance metrics such as accuracy, BLEU, or mAP, while largely ignoring energy consumption and carbon emissions. This single-objective evaluation paradigm is increasingly misaligned with the practical requirements of large-scale deployment, particularly in energy-constrained environments such as mobile devices, developing regions, and climate-aware enterprises. In this paper, we propose AI-CARE, an evaluation tool for reporting energy consumption, and carbon emissions of ML models. In addition, we introduce the carbon-performance tradeoff curve, an interpretable tool that visualizes the Pareto frontier between performance and carbon cost. We demonstrate, through theoretical analysis and empirical validation on representative ML workloads, that carbon-aware benchmarking changes the relative ranking of models and encourages architectures that are simultaneously accurate and environmentally responsible. Our proposal aims to shift the research community toward transparent, multi-objective evaluation and align ML progress with global sustainability goals.

Abstract: Speculative decoding accelerates Large Language Model (LLM) inference by verifying multiple drafted tokens in parallel. However, for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, this parallelism introduces a severe bottleneck: large draft trees activate many unique experts, significantly increasing memory pressure and diminishing speedups from speculative decoding relative to autoregressive decoding. Prior methods reduce speculation depth when MoE verification becomes expensive. We propose MoE-Spec, a training-free verification-time expert budgeting method that decouples speculation depth from memory cost by enforcing a fixed expert capacity limit at each layer, loading only the experts that contribute most to verification and dropping the long tail of rarely used experts that drive bandwidth overhead. Experiments across multiple model scales and datasets show that this method yields 10--30\% higher throughput than state-of-the-art speculative decoding baselines (EAGLE-3) at comparable quality, with flexibility to trade accuracy for further latency reductions through tighter budgets.

Abstract: Mental health disorders affect over 1 billion people worldwide, yet access to care remains limited by workforce shortages and cost constraints. While AI systems show therapeutic promise, current alignment approaches optimize objectives independently, failing to balance patient preferences with clinical safety. We survey 335 individuals with lived mental health experience to collect preference rankings across therapeutic dimensions, then develop a multi-objective alignment framework using direct preference optimization. We train reward models for six criteria -- empathy, safety, active listening, self-motivated change, trust/rapport, and patient autonomy -- and systematically compare multi-objective approaches against single-objective optimization, supervised fine-tuning, and parameter merging. Multi-objective DPO (MODPO) achieves superior balance (77.6% empathy, 62.6% safety) compared to single-objective optimization (93.6% empathy, 47.8% safety), and therapeutic criteria outperform general communication principles by 17.2%. Blinded clinician evaluation confirms MODPO is consistently preferred, with LLM-evaluator agreement comparable to inter-clinician reliability.

Abstract: Railway crossings present complex safety challenges where driver behavior varies by location, time, and conditions. Traditional approaches analyze crossings individually, limiting the ability to identify shared behavioral patterns across locations. We propose a multi-view tensor decomposition framework that captures behavioral similarities across three temporal phases: Approach (warning activation to gate lowering), Waiting (gates down to train passage), and Clearance (train passage to gate raising). We analyze railway crossing videos from multiple locations using TimeSformer embeddings to represent each phase. By constructing phase-specific similarity matrices and applying non-negative symmetric CP decomposition, we discover latent behavioral components with distinct temporal signatures. Our tensor analysis reveals that crossing location appears to be a stronger determinant of behavior patterns than time of day, and that approach-phase behavior provides particularly discriminative signatures. Visualization of the learned component space confirms location-based clustering, with certain crossings forming distinct behavioral clusters. This automated framework enables scalable pattern discovery across multiple crossings, providing a foundation for grouping locations by behavioral similarity to inform targeted safety interventions.

Abstract: Epilepsy affects over 50 million people worldwide, and one-third of patients suffer drug-resistant seizures where surgery offers the best chance of seizure freedom. Accurate localization of the epileptogenic zone (EZ) relies on intracranial EEG (iEEG). Clinical workflows, however, remain constrained by labor-intensive manual review. At the same time, existing data-driven approaches are typically developed on single-center datasets that are inconsistent in format and metadata, lack standardized benchmarks, and rarely release pathological event annotations, creating barriers to reproducibility, cross-center validation, and clinical relevance. With extensive efforts to reconcile heterogeneous iEEG formats, metadata, and recordings across publicly available sources, we present $\textbf{Omni-iEEG}$, a large-scale, pre-surgical iEEG resource comprising $\textbf{302 patients}$ and $\textbf{178 hours}$ of high-resolution recordings. The dataset includes harmonized clinical metadata such as seizure onset zones, resections, and surgical outcomes, all validated by board-certified epileptologists. In addition, Omni-iEEG provides over 36K expert-validated annotations of pathological events, enabling robust biomarker studies. Omni-iEEG serves as a bridge between machine learning and epilepsy research. It defines clinically meaningful tasks with unified evaluation metrics grounded in clinical priors, enabling systematic evaluation of models in clinically relevant settings. Beyond benchmarking, we demonstrate the potential of end-to-end modeling on long iEEG segments and highlight the transferability of representations pretrained on non-neurophysiological domains. Together, these contributions establish Omni-iEEG as a foundation for reproducible, generalizable, and clinically translatable epilepsy research.

Abstract: Any-order autoregressive models (AO-ARMs) offer a promising path toward efficient masked diffusion by enabling native key-value caching, but competitive performance has so far required two-stream attention, typically motivated as a means of decoupling token content from position. In this work, we argue that two-stream attention may be serving a more subtle role. We identify a structural-semantic tradeoff in any-order generation: the hidden representation at each step must simultaneously attend to semantically informative tokens for prediction and structurally recent tokens for summarization, objectives that compete for attention capacity in a single stream but can specialize across two streams. To isolate this tradeoff from position-content separation, we propose Decoupled RoPE, a modification to rotary position embeddings that provides target position information without revealing target content. Decoupled RoPE performs competitively at short sequence lengths--where semantic and structural proximity coincide--but degrades as sequence length increases and the two orderings diverge. These results suggest that the success of two-stream attention stems not merely from separating position from content, but from circumventing the deeper structural-semantic tradeoff inherent to any-order generation.

Abstract: Reliable and cost-effective maintenance is essential for railway safety, particularly at the wheel-rail interface, which is prone to wear and failure. Predictive maintenance frameworks increasingly leverage sensor-generated time-series data, yet traditional methods require manual feature engineering, and deep learning models often degrade in online settings with evolving operational patterns. This work presents a semantic-aware, label-efficient continual learning framework for railway fault diagnostics. Accelerometer signals are encoded via a Variational AutoEncoder into latent representations capturing the normal operational structure in a fully unsupervised manner. Importantly, semantic metadata, including axle counts, wheel indexes, and strain-based deformations, is extracted via AI-driven peak detection on fiber Bragg grating sensors (resistant to electromagnetic interference) and fused with the VAE embeddings, enhancing anomaly detection under unknown operational conditions. A lightweight gradient boosting supervised classifier stabilizes anomaly scoring with minimal labels, while a replay-based continual learning strategy enables adaptation to evolving domains without catastrophic forgetting. Experiments show the model detects minor imperfections due to flats and polygonization, while adapting to evolving operational conditions, such as changes in train type, speed, load, and track profiles, captured using a single accelerometer and strain gauge in wayside monitoring.

Abstract: This paper introduces and demonstrates a computational pipeline for the statistical analysis of shape graph datasets, namely geometric networks embedded in 2D or 3D spaces. Unlike traditional abstract graphs, our purpose is not only to retrieve and distinguish variations in the connectivity structure of the data but also geometric differences of the network branches. Our proposed approach relies on the extraction of a specifically curated and explicit set of topological, geometric and directional features, designed to satisfy key invariance properties. We leverage the resulting feature representation for tasks such as group comparison, clustering and classification on cohorts of shape graphs. The effectiveness of this representation is evaluated on several real-world datasets including urban road/street networks, neuronal traces and astrocyte imaging. These results are benchmarked against several alternative methods, both feature-based and not.

Abstract: Learning with shared representation is widely recognized as an effective way to separate commonalities from heterogeneity across various heterogeneous sources. Most existing work includes all related data sources via simultaneously training a common feature extractor and source-specific heads. It is well understood that data sources with low relevance or poor quality may hinder representation learning. In this paper, we further dive into the question of which data sources should be learned jointly by focusing on the traditionally deemed ``good'' collection of sources, in which individual sources have similar relevance and qualities with respect to the true underlying common structure. Towards tractability, we focus on the linear setting where sources share a low-dimensional subspace. We find that source screening can play a central role in statistically optimal subspace estimation. We show that, for a broad class of problem instances, training on a carefully selected subset of sources suffices to achieve minimax optimality, even when a substantial portion of data is discarded. We formalize the notion of an informative subpopulation, develop algorithms and practical heuristics for identifying such subsets, and validate their effectiveness through both theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: There are a number of existing studies analysing the convergence behaviour of graph neural networks on large random graphs. Unfortunately, the majority of these studies do not model correlations between node features, which would naturally exist in a variety of real-life networks. Consequently, the derived limitations of GNNs, resulting from such convergence behaviour, is not truly reflective of the expressive power of GNNs when applied to realistic graphs. In this paper, we will introduce a novel method to generate random graphs that have correlated node features. The node features will be sampled in such a manner to ensure correlation between neighbouring nodes. As motivation for our choice of sampling scheme, we will appeal to properties exhibited by real-life graphs, particularly properties that are captured by the Barabási-Albert model. A theoretical analysis will strongly indicate that convergence can be avoided in some cases, which we will empirically validate on large random graphs generated using our novel method. The observed divergent behaviour provides evidence that GNNs may be more expressive than initial studies would suggest, especially on realistic graphs.

Abstract: Cross-subject generalization in EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) remains challenging due to individual variability in neural signals. We investigate whether spectral representations offer more stable features for cross-subject transfer than temporal waveforms. Through correlation analyses across three EEG paradigms (SSVEP, P300, and Motor Imagery), we find that spectral features exhibit consistently higher cross-subject similarity than temporal signals. Motivated by this observation, we introduce ASPEN, a hybrid architecture that combines spectral and temporal feature streams via multiplicative fusion, requiring cross-modal agreement for features to propagate. Experiments across six benchmark datasets reveal that ASPEN is able to dynamically achieve the optimal spectral-temporal balance depending on the paradigm. ASPEN achieves the best unseen-subject accuracy on three of six datasets and competitive performance on others, demonstrating that multiplicative multimodal fusion enables effective cross-subject generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界部署面临分布偏移、群体不平衡和对抗扰动等问题，传统经验风险最小化（ERM）框架表现不佳。分布鲁棒优化（DRO）通过优化不确定性集合中的最坏情况损失提供鲁棒解决方案，但训练数据包含敏感信息需要差分隐私保护。然而，DP-DRO因具有不确定性约束的极小极大优化结构而研究较少。

Method: 首先将具有一般ψ-散度的DRO重新表述为最小化问题，提出DP Double-Spider方法；对于KL散度的特殊情况，将问题转化为复合有限和优化问题，提出DP Recursive-Spider方法。两种方法都采用(ε, δ)-差分隐私保护机制。

Result: DP Double-Spider在梯度范数上实现O(1/√n + (√d log(1/δ)/(nε))^{2/3})的效用界。DP Recursive-Spider对KL散度实现O((√d log(1/δ)/(nε))^{2/3})的效用界，与非凸DP-ERM的最佳已知结果匹配。实验表明所提方法优于现有的DP极小极大优化方法。

Conclusion: 研究工作为具有ψ-散度的非凸DP-DRO提供了全面的理论和算法框架，提出的方法在理论保证和实际性能上都优于现有方法，特别是针对KL散度的算法达到了与非凸DP-ERM相匹配的最佳效用界。

Abstract: Real-world deployments routinely face distribution shifts, group imbalances, and adversarial perturbations, under which the traditional Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) framework can degrade severely.
  Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) addresses this issue by optimizing the worst-case expected loss over an uncertainty set of distributions, offering a principled approach to robustness.
  Meanwhile, as training data in DRO always involves sensitive information, safeguarding it against leakage under Differential Privacy (DP) is essential.
  In contrast to classical DP-ERM, DP-DRO has received much less attention due to its minimax optimization structure with uncertainty constraint.
  To bridge the gap, we provide a comprehensive study of DP-(finite-sum)-DRO with $ψ$-divergence and non-convex loss.
  First, we study DRO with general $ψ$-divergence by reformulating it as a minimization problem, and develop a novel $(\varepsilon, δ)$-DP optimization method, called DP Double-Spider, tailored to this structure.
  Under mild assumptions, we show that it achieves a utility bound of $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+ (\frac{\sqrt{d \log (1/δ)}}{n \varepsilon})^{2/3})$ in terms of the gradient norm, where $n$ denotes the data size and $d$ denotes the model dimension.
  We further improve the utility rate for specific divergences.
  In particular, for DP-DRO with KL-divergence, by transforming the problem into a compositional finite-sum optimization problem, we develop a DP Recursive-Spider method and show that it achieves a utility bound of $\mathcal{O}((\frac{\sqrt{d \log(1/δ)}}{n\varepsilon})^{2/3} )$, matching the best-known result for non-convex DP-ERM.
  Experimentally, we demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform existing approaches for DP minimax optimization.

Abstract: Training LLMs as interactive agents for multi-turn decision-making remains challenging, particularly in long-horizon tasks with sparse and delayed rewards, where agents must execute extended sequences of actions before receiving meaningful feedback. Most existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches model LLM agents as flat policies operating at a single time scale, selecting one action at each turn. In sparse-reward settings, such flat policies must propagate credit across the entire trajectory without explicit temporal abstraction, which often leads to unstable optimization and inefficient credit assignment.
  We propose HiPER, a novel Hierarchical Plan-Execute RL framework that explicitly separates high-level planning from low-level execution. HiPER factorizes the policy into a high-level planner that proposes subgoals and a low-level executor that carries them out over multiple action steps. To align optimization with this structure, we introduce a key technique called hierarchical advantage estimation (HAE), which carefully assigns credit at both the planning and execution levels. By aggregating returns over the execution of each subgoal and coordinating updates across the two levels, HAE provides an unbiased gradient estimator and provably reduces variance compared to flat generalized advantage estimation.
  Empirically, HiPER achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging interactive benchmarks, reaching 97.4\% success on ALFWorld and 83.3\% on WebShop with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (+6.6\% and +8.3\% over the best prior method), with especially large gains on long-horizon tasks requiring multiple dependent subtasks. These results highlight the importance of explicit hierarchical decomposition for scalable RL training of multi-turn LLM agents.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks and neural operators often suffer from severe optimization difficulties caused by ill-conditioned gradients, multi-scale spectral behavior, and stiffness induced by physical constraints. Recently, the Muon optimizer has shown promise by performing orthogonalized updates in the singular-vector basis of the gradient, thereby improving geometric conditioning. However, its unit-singular-value updates may lead to overly aggressive steps and lack explicit stability guarantees when applied to physics-informed learning. In this work, we propose SpecMuon, a spectral-aware optimizer that integrates Muon's orthogonalized geometry with a mode-wise relaxed scalar auxiliary variable (RSAV) mechanism. By decomposing matrix-valued gradients into singular modes and applying RSAV updates individually along dominant spectral directions, SpecMuon adaptively regulates step sizes according to the global loss energy while preserving Muon's scale-balancing properties. This formulation interprets optimization as a multi-mode gradient flow and enables principled control of stiff spectral components. We establish rigorous theoretical properties of SpecMuon, including a modified energy dissipation law, positivity and boundedness of auxiliary variables, and global convergence with a linear rate under the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition. Numerical experiments on physics-informed neural networks, DeepONets, and fractional PINN-DeepONets demonstrate that SpecMuon achieves faster convergence and improved stability compared with Adam, AdamW, and the original Muon optimizer on benchmark problems such as the one-dimensional Burgers equation and fractional partial differential equations.

Abstract: Non-autoregressive (NAR) generation reduces decoding latency by predicting many tokens in parallel, but iterative refinement often suffers from error accumulation and distribution shift under self-generated drafts. Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) and their remasking samplers (e.g., ReMDM) can be viewed as modern NAR iterative refinement, where generation repeatedly revises a partially observed draft. In this work we show that \emph{training alone} can substantially improve the step-efficiency of MDLM/ReMDM sampling. We propose \textsc{DSL} (Discrete Stochastic Localization), which trains a single SNR-invariant denoiser across a continuum of corruption levels, bridging intermediate draft noise and mask-style endpoint corruption within one Diffusion Transformer. On OpenWebText, \textsc{DSL} fine-tuning yields large MAUVE gains at low step budgets, surpassing the MDLM+ReMDM baseline with \(\sim\)4$\times$ fewer denoiser evaluations, and matches autoregressive quality at high budgets. Analyses show improved self-correction and uncertainty calibration, making remasking markedly more compute-efficient.

Abstract: Energy theft poses a significant threat to the stability and efficiency of smart grids, leading to substantial economic losses and operational challenges. Traditional centralized machine learning approaches for theft detection require aggregating user data, raising serious concerns about privacy and data security. These issues are further exacerbated in smart meter environments, where devices are often resource-constrained and lack the capacity to run heavy models. In this work, we propose a privacy-preserving federated learning framework for energy theft detection that addresses both privacy and computational constraints. Our approach leverages a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP) model, suitable for deployment on low-power smart meters, and integrates basic differential privacy (DP) by injecting Gaussian noise into local model updates before aggregation. This ensures formal privacy guarantees without compromising learning performance. We evaluate our framework on a real-world smart meter dataset under both IID and non-IID data distributions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC scores while maintaining privacy and efficiency. This makes the proposed solution practical and scalable for secure energy theft detection in next-generation smart grid infrastructures.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的时序大语言模型方法Temporal-Prior Conditioning，通过将时间作为一等模态深度集成到模型中，显著提升了长期预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM时序方法通常只在输入层浅层地注入时间信息，随着层数增加时间信息会退化，限制了模型的时间推理能力。

Method: TPC将时间提升为一等模态，在学习的时间序列token流中加入可学习的交叉注意力模块，在多层深度中通过交叉注意力从人类可读的时间描述中提取时间嵌入，再通过自注意力将时间上下文反馈给序列。这种方法解耦了时间序列信号和时间信息，只训练少量交叉注意力模块。

Result: TPC在多种数据集上的长期预测任务中，无论是全面微调还是浅层条件化策略，都实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: TPC通过深度整合时间信息作为一等模态，有效解决了传统方法中时间信息退化的问题，为时序大语言模型提供了更有效的架构方案。

Abstract: LLM-for-time series (TS) methods typically treat time shallowly, injecting positional or prompt-based cues once at the input of a largely frozen decoder, which limits temporal reasoning as this information degrades through the layers. We introduce Temporal-Prior Conditioning (TPC), which elevates time to a first-class modality that conditions the model at multiple depths. TPC attaches a small set of learnable time series tokens to the patch stream; at selected layers these tokens cross-attend to temporal embeddings derived from compact, human-readable temporal descriptors encoded by the same frozen LLM, then feed temporal context back via self-attention. This disentangles time series signal and temporal information while maintaining a low parameter budget. We show that by training only the cross-attention modules and explicitly disentangling time series signal and temporal information, TPC consistently outperforms both full fine-tuning and shallow conditioning strategies, achieving state-of-the-art performance in long-term forecasting across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: 几何压缩映射为PINN处理多尺度PDE提供了一种有效的输入坐标变换方法，有效解决了传统方法的几何不对齐问题，在保持PINN架构不变的前提下显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Several complex physical systems are governed by multi-scale partial differential equations (PDEs) that exhibit both smooth low-frequency components and localized high-frequency structures. Existing physics-informed neural network (PINN) methods typically train with fixed coordinate system inputs, where geometric misalignment with these structures induces gradient stiffness and ill-conditioning that hinder convergence. To address this issue, we introduce a mapping paradigm that reshapes the input coordinates through differentiable geometric compactification mappings and couples the geometric structure of PDEs with the spectral properties of residual operators. Based on this paradigm, we propose Geometric Compactification (GC)-PINN, a framework that introduces three mapping strategies for periodic boundaries, far-field scale expansion, and localized singular structures in the input domain without modifying the underlying PINN architecture. Extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that this approach yields more uniform residual distributions and higher solution accuracy on representative 1D and 2D PDEs, while improving training stability and convergence speed.

Abstract: Coordinating large populations of interacting agents is a central challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where the size of the joint state-action space scales exponentially with the number of agents. Mean-field methods alleviate this burden by aggregating agent interactions, but these approaches assume homogeneous interactions. Recent graphon-based frameworks capture heterogeneity, but are computationally expensive as the number of agents grows. Therefore, we introduce $\texttt{GMFS}$, a $\textbf{G}$raphon $\textbf{M}$ean-$\textbf{F}$ield $\textbf{S}$ubsampling framework for scalable cooperative MARL with heterogeneous agent interactions. By subsampling $κ$ agents according to interaction strength, we approximate the graphon-weighted mean-field and learn a policy with sample complexity $\mathrm{poly}(κ)$ and optimality gap $O(1/\sqrtκ)$. We verify our theory with numerical simulations in robotic coordination, showing that $\texttt{GMFS}$ achieves near-optimal performance.

Result: 在标准多模态基准测试中的实验表明，ModalImmune提高了对模态删除和损坏的鲁棒性，同时保持了收敛稳定性和重构能力。

Conclusion: ModalImmune通过可控地崩溃选定模态信息来学习联合表征，使模型对破坏性模态影响具有鲁棒性，增强了多模态系统的可靠性。

Abstract: Multimodal systems are vulnerable to partial or complete loss of input channels at deployment, which undermines reliability in real-world settings. This paper presents ModalImmune, a training framework that enforces modality immunity by intentionally and controllably collapsing selected modality information during training so the model learns joint representations that are robust to destructive modality influence. The framework combines a spectrum-adaptive collapse regularizer, an information-gain guided controller for targeted interventions, curvature-aware gradient masking to stabilize destructive updates, and a certified Neumann-truncated hyper-gradient procedure for automatic meta-parameter adaptation. Empirical evaluation on standard multimodal benchmarks demonstrates that ModalImmune improves resilience to modality removal and corruption while retaining convergence stability and reconstruction capacity.

Abstract: Adaptation methods have been a workhorse for unlocking the transformative power of pre-trained diffusion models in diverse applications. Existing approaches often abstract adaptation objectives as a reward function and steer diffusion models to generate high-reward samples. However, these approaches can incur high computational overhead due to additional training, or rely on stringent assumptions on the reward such as differentiability. Moreover, despite their empirical success, theoretical justification and guarantees are seldom established. In this paper, we propose DOIT (Doob-Oriented Inference-time Transformation), a training-free and computationally efficient adaptation method that applies to generic, non-differentiable rewards. The key framework underlying our method is a measure transport formulation that seeks to transport the pre-trained generative distribution to a high-reward target distribution. We leverage Doob's $h$-transform to realize this transport, which induces a dynamic correction to the diffusion sampling process and enables efficient simulation-based computation without modifying the pre-trained model. Theoretically, we establish a high probability convergence guarantee to the target high-reward distribution via characterizing the approximation error in the dynamic Doob's correction. Empirically, on D4RL offline RL benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while preserving sampling efficiency.

Abstract: Neurochaos Learning (NL) has shown promise in recent times over traditional deep learning due to its two key features: ability to learn from small sized training samples, and low compute requirements. In prior work, NL has been implemented and extensively tested on separable and time series data, and demonstrated its superior performance on both classification and regression tasks. In this paper, we investigate the next step in NL, viz., applying NL to linked data, in particular, data that is represented in the form of knowledge graphs. We integrate linked data into NL by implementing node aggregation on knowledge graphs, and then feeding the aggregated node features to the simplest NL architecture: ChaosNet. We demonstrate the results of our implementation on homophilic graph datasets as well as heterophilic graph datasets of verying heterophily. We show better efficacy of our approach on homophilic graphs than on heterophilic graphs. While doing so, we also present our analysis of the results, as well as suggestions for future work.

Motivation: 现有神经算子在多层迭代和长时程预测中存在不稳定性问题，这是由于欧几里得潜在空间更新违反了几何和守恒定律。需要一种方法将几何约束引入神经算子学习过程，提高长期预测的保真度。

Abstract: Neural operators offer an effective framework for learning solutions of partial differential equations for many physical systems in a resolution-invariant and data-driven manner. Existing neural operators, however, often suffer from instability in multi-layer iteration and long-horizon rollout, which stems from the unconstrained Euclidean latent space updates that violate the geometric and conservation laws. To address this challenge, we propose to constrain manifolds with low-rank Lie algebra parameterization that performs group action updates on the latent representation. Our method, termed Manifold Constraining based on Lie group (MCL), acts as an efficient \emph{plug-and-play} module that enforces geometric inductive bias to existing neural operators. Extensive experiments on various partial differential equations, such as 1-D Burgers and 2-D Navier-Stokes, over a wide range of parameters and steps demonstrate that our method effectively lowers the relative prediction error by 30-50\% at the cost of 2.26\% of parameter increase. The results show that our approach provides a scalable solution for improving long-term prediction fidelity by addressing the principled geometric constraints absent in the neural operator updates.

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to sea ice modeling using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), utilizing the natural graph structure of sea ice, where nodes represent individual ice pieces, and edges model the physical interactions, including collisions. This concept is developed within a one-dimensional framework as a foundational step. Traditional numerical methods, while effective, are computationally intensive and less scalable. By utilizing GNNs, the proposed model, termed the Collision-captured Network (CN), integrates data assimilation (DA) techniques to effectively learn and predict sea ice dynamics under various conditions. The approach was validated using synthetic data, both with and without observed data points, and it was found that the model accelerates the simulation of trajectories without compromising accuracy. This advancement offers a more efficient tool for forecasting in marginal ice zones (MIZ) and highlights the potential of combining machine learning with data assimilation for more effective and efficient modeling.

Abstract: Deep learning has improved automated electrocardiogram (ECG) classification, but limited insight into prediction reliability hinders its use in safety-critical settings. This paper proposes UCTECG-Net, an uncertainty-aware hybrid architecture that combines one-dimensional convolutions and Transformer encoders to process raw ECG signals and their spectrograms jointly. Evaluated on the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia and PTB Diagnostic datasets, UCTECG-Net outperforms LSTM, CNN1D, and Transformer baselines in terms of accuracy, precision, recall and F1 score, achieving up to 98.58% accuracy on MIT-BIH and 99.14% on PTB. To assess predictive reliability, we integrate three uncertainty quantification methods (Monte Carlo Dropout, Deep Ensembles, and Ensemble Monte Carlo Dropout) into all models and analyze their behavior using an uncertainty-aware confusion matrix and derived metrics. The results show that UCTECG-Net, particularly with Ensemble or EMCD, provides more reliable and better-aligned uncertainty estimates than competing architectures, offering a stronger basis for risk-aware ECG decision support.

Abstract: Weight-space models learn directly from the parameters of neural networks, enabling tasks such as predicting their accuracy on new datasets. Naive methods -- like applying MLPs to flattened parameters -- perform poorly, making the design of better weight-space architectures a central challenge. While prior work leveraged permutation symmetries in standard networks to guide such designs, no analogous analysis or tailored architecture yet exists for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). In this work, we show that KANs share the same permutation symmetries as MLPs, and propose the KAN-graph, a graph representation of their computation. Building on this, we develop WS-KAN, the first weight-space architecture that learns on KANs, which naturally accounts for their symmetry. We analyze WS-KAN's expressive power, showing it can replicate an input KAN's forward pass - a standard approach for assessing expressiveness in weight-space architectures. We construct a comprehensive ``zoo'' of trained KANs spanning diverse tasks, which we use as benchmarks to empirically evaluate WS-KAN. Across all tasks, WS-KAN consistently outperforms structure-agnostic baselines, often by a substantial margin. Our code is available at https://github.com/BarSGuy/KAN-Graph-Metanetwork.

Finally, we evaluate our algorithm using geological modelling data, showcasing its adaptiveness and ability to honour complex topology.

Abstract: Bayesian quadrature is a probabilistic, model-based approach to numerical integration, the estimation of intractable integrals, or expectations. Although Bayesian quadrature was popularised already in the 1980s, no systematic and comprehensive treatment has been published. The purpose of this survey is to fill this gap. We review the mathematical foundations of Bayesian quadrature from different points of view; present a systematic taxonomy for classifying different Bayesian quadrature methods along the three axes of modelling, inference, and sampling; collect general theoretical guarantees; and provide a controlled numerical study that explores and illustrates the effect of different choices along the axes of the taxonomy. We also provide a realistic assessment of practical challenges and limitations to application of Bayesian quadrature methods and include an up-to-date and nearly exhaustive bibliography that covers not only machine learning and statistics literature but all areas of mathematics and engineering in which Bayesian quadrature or equivalent methods have seen use.

Abstract: Modeling multiscale patterns is crucial for long-term time series forecasting (TSF). However, redundancy and noise in time series, together with semantic gaps between non-adjacent scales, make the efficient alignment and integration of multi-scale temporal dependencies challenging. To address this, we propose SEMixer, a lightweight multiscale model designed for long-term TSF. SEMixer features two key components: a Random Attention Mechanism (RAM) and a Multiscale Progressive Mixing Chain (MPMC). RAM captures diverse time-patch interactions during training and aggregates them via dropout ensemble at inference, enhancing patch-level semantics and enabling MLP-Mixer to better model multi-scale dependencies. MPMC further stacks RAM and MLP-Mixer in a memory-efficient manner, achieving more effective temporal mixing. It addresses semantic gaps across scales and facilitates better multiscale modeling and forecasting performance. We not only validate the effectiveness of SEMixer on 10 public datasets, but also on the \textit{2025 CCF AlOps Challenge} based on 21GB real wireless network data, where SEMixer achieves third place. The code is available at the link https://github.com/Meteor-Stars/SEMixer.

Abstract: This work presents HAWX, a hardware-aware scalable exploration framework that employs multi-level sensitivity scoring at different DNN abstraction levels (operator, filter, layer, and model) to guide selective integration of heterogeneous AxC blocks. Supported by predictive models for accuracy, power, and area, HAWX accelerates the evaluation of candidate configurations, achieving over 23* speedup in a layer-level search with two candidate approximate blocks and more than (3*106)* speedup at the filter-level search only for LeNet-5, while maintaining accuracy comparable to exhaustive search. Experiments across state-of-the-art DNN benchmarks such as VGG-11, ResNet-18, and EfficientNetLite demonstrate that the efficiency benefits of HAWX scale exponentially with network size. The HAWX hardware-aware search algorithm supports both spatial and temporal accelerator architectures, leveraging either off-the-shelf approximate components or customized designs.

Abstract: Time series data are prone to noise in various domains, and training samples may contain low-predictability patterns that deviate from the normal data distribution, leading to training instability or convergence to poor local minima. Therefore, mitigating the adverse effects of low-predictability samples is crucial for time series analysis tasks such as time series forecasting (TSF) and time series classification (TSC). While many deep learning models have achieved promising performance, few consider how to identify and penalize low-predictability samples to improve model performance from the training perspective. To fill this gap, we propose a general Amortized Predictability-aware Training Framework (APTF) for both TSF and TSC. APTF introduces two key designs that enable the model to focus on high-predictability samples while still learning appropriately from low-predictability ones: (i) a Hierarchical Predictability-aware Loss (HPL) that dynamically identifies low-predictability samples and progressively expands their loss penalty as training evolves, and (ii) an amortization model that mitigates predictability estimation errors caused by model bias, further enhancing HPL's effectiveness. The code is available at https://github.com/Meteor-Stars/APTF.

Abstract: Learning latent actions from action-free video has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling up controllable world model learning. Latent actions provide a natural interface for users to iteratively generate and manipulate videos. However, most existing approaches rely on monolithic inverse and forward dynamics models that learn a single latent action to control the entire scene, and therefore struggle in complex environments where multiple entities act simultaneously. This paper introduces Factored Latent Action Model (FLAM), a factored dynamics framework that decomposes the scene into independent factors, each inferring its own latent action and predicting its own next-step factor value. This factorized structure enables more accurate modeling of complex multi-entity dynamics and improves video generation quality in action-free video settings compared to monolithic models. Based on experiments on both simulation and real-world multi-entity datasets, we find that FLAM outperforms prior work in prediction accuracy and representation quality, and facilitates downstream policy learning, demonstrating the benefits of factorized latent action models.

Abstract: Conventional large language model (LLM) fairness alignment largely focuses on mitigating bias along single sensitive attributes, overlooking fairness as an inherently multidimensional and context-specific value. This approach risks creating systems that achieve narrow fairness metrics while exacerbating disparities along untargeted attributes, a phenomenon known as bias spillover. While extensively studied in machine learning, bias spillover remains critically underexplored in LLM alignment. In this work, we investigate how targeted gender alignment affects fairness across nine sensitive attributes in three state-of-the-art LLMs (Mistral 7B, Llama 3.1 8B, Qwen 2.5 7B). Using Direct Preference Optimization and the BBQ benchmark, we evaluate fairness under ambiguous and disambiguous contexts. Our findings reveal noticeable bias spillover: while aggregate results show improvements, context-aware analysis exposes significant degradations in ambiguous contexts, particularly for physical appearance ($p< 0.001$ across all models), sexual orientation, and disability status. We demonstrate that improving fairness along one attribute can inadvertently worsen disparities in others under uncertainty, highlighting the necessity of context-aware, multi-attribute fairness evaluation frameworks.

Abstract: In this work, we develop, for the first time, a supervised classification framework with class-dependent rewards (CDR) to predict $\geq$MM flares within 24 hr. We construct multiple datasets, covering knowledge-informed features and line-of sight (LOS) magnetograms. We also apply three deep learning models (CNN, CNN-BiLSTM, and Transformer) and three CDR counterparts (CDR-CNN, CDR-CNN-BiLSTM, and CDR-Transformer). First, we analyze the importance of LOS magnetic field parameters with the Transformer, then compare its performance using LOS-only, vector-only, and combined magnetic field parameters. Second, we compare flare prediction performance based on CDR models versus deep learning counterparts. Third, we perform sensitivity analysis on reward engineering for CDR models. Fourth, we use the SHAP method for model interpretability. Finally, we conduct performance comparison between our models and NASA/CCMC. The main findings are: (1)Among LOS feature combinations, R_VALUE and AREA_ACR consistently yield the best results. (2)Transformer achieves better performance with combined LOS and vector magnetic field data than with either alone. (3)Models using knowledge-informed features outperform those using magnetograms. (4)While CNN and CNN-BiLSTM outperform their CDR counterparts on magnetograms, CDR-Transformer is slightly superior to its deep learning counterpart when using knowledge-informed features. Among all models, CDR-Transformer achieves the best performance. (5)The predictive performance of the CDR models is not overly sensitive to the reward choices.(6)Through SHAP analysis, the CDR model tends to regard TOTUSJH as more important, while the Transformer tends to prioritize R_VALUE more.(7)Under identical prediction time and active region (AR) number, the CDR-Transformer shows superior predictive capabilities compared to NASA/CCMC.

Motivation: 传统在线Q-learning在高概率遗憾界理论分析方面存在空白，特别是在无乐观或奖励项的情况下。现有方法对MDP次优间隙敏感，当间隙较小时遗憾界会恶化，需要开发更鲁棒的算法和分析工具。

Method: 1) 分析衰减温度Boltzmann Q-learning，证明其遗憾与MDP次优间隙的临界依赖关系；2) 提出平滑ε-贪婪探索方案，结合ε-贪婪和Boltzmann探索；3) 开发收缩马尔可夫随机逼近的高概率集中界分析方法，处理迭代和时间相关的转移动态。

Result: 1) Boltzmann Q-learning在足够大的次优间隙下获得次线性遗憾，但在小间隙下可能接近线性增长；2) 平滑ε-贪婪探索方案获得近O(N^{9/10})的gap-robust遗憾界；3) 建立了收缩因子由混合时间控制且允许渐近收敛到1的高概率集中界。

Conclusion: 本文填补了传统在线Q-learning理论分析的空白，揭示了算法性能对MDP次优间隙的依赖关系，提出了更鲁棒的探索策略，并为马尔可夫随机逼近分析提供了新的理论工具。

Abstract: We present the first high-probability regret bound for classical online Q-learning in infinite-horizon discounted Markov decision processes, without relying on optimism or bonus terms. We first analyze Boltzmann Q-learning with decaying temperature and show that its regret depends critically on the suboptimality gap of the MDP: for sufficiently large gaps, the regret is sublinear, while for small gaps it deteriorates and can approach linear growth. To address this limitation, we study a Smoothed $ε_n$-Greedy exploration scheme that combines $ε_n$-greedy and Boltzmann exploration, for which we prove a gap-robust regret bound of near-$\tilde{O}(N^{9/10})$. To analyze these algorithms, we develop a high-probability concentration bound for contractive Markovian stochastic approximation with iterate- and time-dependent transition dynamics. This bound may be of independent interest as the contraction factor in our bound is governed by the mixing time and is allowed to converge to one asymptotically.

Conclusion: 提出的GICDM方法有效修正了嵌入空间中的枢纽现象偏置，使生成模型评估更加准确可靠。

Abstract: Generative model evaluation commonly relies on high-dimensional embedding spaces to compute distances between samples. We show that dataset representations in these spaces are affected by the hubness phenomenon, which distorts nearest neighbor relationships and biases distance-based metrics. Building on the classical Iterative Contextual Dissimilarity Measure (ICDM), we introduce Generative ICDM (GICDM), a method to correct neighborhood estimation for both real and generated data. We introduce a multi-scale extension to improve empirical behavior. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real benchmarks demonstrate that GICDM resolves hubness-induced failures, restores reliable metric behavior, and improves alignment with human judgment.

Abstract: Scaling language models to long contexts is often bottlenecked by the size of the key-value (KV) cache. In deployed settings, long contexts are typically managed through compaction in token space via summarization. However, summarization can be highly lossy, substantially harming downstream performance. Recent work on Cartridges has shown that it is possible to train highly compact KV caches in latent space that closely match full-context performance, but at the cost of slow and expensive end-to-end optimization. This work describes an approach for fast context compaction in latent space through Attention Matching, which constructs compact keys and values to reproduce attention outputs and preserve attention mass at a per-KV-head level. We show that this formulation naturally decomposes into simple subproblems, some of which admit efficient closed-form solutions. Within this framework, we develop a family of methods that significantly push the Pareto frontier of compaction time versus quality, achieving up to 50x compaction in seconds on some datasets with little quality loss.

Abstract: Analytical diffusion models offer a mathematically transparent path to generative modeling by formulating the denoising score as an empirical-Bayes posterior mean. However, this interpretability comes at a prohibitive cost: the standard formulation necessitates a full-dataset scan at every timestep, scaling linearly with dataset size. In this work, we present the first systematic study addressing this scalability bottleneck. We challenge the prevailing assumption that the entire training data is necessary, uncovering the phenomenon of Posterior Progressive Concentration: the effective golden support of the denoising score is not static but shrinks asymptotically from the global manifold to a local neighborhood as the signal-to-noise ratio increases. Capitalizing on this, we propose Dynamic Time-Aware Golden Subset Diffusion (GoldDiff), a training-free framework that decouples inference complexity from dataset size. Instead of static retrieval, GoldDiff uses a coarse-to-fine mechanism to dynamically pinpoint the ''Golden Subset'' for inference. Theoretically, we derive rigorous bounds guaranteeing that our sparse approximation converges to the exact score. Empirically, GoldDiff achieves a $\bf 71 \times$ speedup on AFHQ while matching or achieving even better performance than full-scan baselines. Most notably, we demonstrate the first successful scaling of analytical diffusion to ImageNet-1K, unlocking a scalable, training-free paradigm for large-scale generative modeling.

Abstract: Generalized additive models (GAMs) offer interpretability through independent univariate feature effects but underfit when interactions are present in data. GA$^2$Ms add selected pairwise interactions which improves accuracy, but sacrifices interpretability and limits model auditing. We propose \emph{Conditionally Additive Local Models} (CALMs), a new model class, that balances the interpretability of GAMs with the accuracy of GA$^2$Ms. CALMs allow multiple univariate shape functions per feature, each active in different regions of the input space. These regions are defined independently for each feature as simple logical conditions (thresholds) on the features it interacts with. As a result, effects remain locally additive while varying across subregions to capture interactions. We further propose a principled distillation-based training pipeline that identifies homogeneous regions with limited interactions and fits interpretable shape functions via region-aware backfitting. Experiments on diverse classification and regression tasks show that CALMs consistently outperform GAMs and achieve accuracy comparable with GA$^2$Ms. Overall, CALMs offer a compelling trade-off between predictive accuracy and interpretability.

Conclusion: 该模型在CARAVAN生态系统中首次实现端到端训练，为水文界提供了一个简化、可操作性强且可复现的可靠基线预报系统

Abstract: Reliable global streamflow forecasting is essential for flood preparedness and water resource management, yet data-driven models often suffer from a performance gap when transitioning from historical reanalysis to operational forecast products. This paper introduces AIFL (Artificial Intelligence for Floods), a deterministic LSTM-based model designed for global daily streamflow forecasting. Trained on 18,588 basins curated from the CARAVAN dataset, AIFL utilises a novel two-stage training strategy to bridge the reanalysis-to-forecast domain shift. The model is first pre-trained on 40 years of ERA5-Land reanalysis (1980-2019) to capture robust hydrological processes, then fine-tuned on operational Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) control forecasts (2016-2019) to adapt to the specific error structures and biases of operational numerical weather prediction. To our knowledge, this is the first global model trained end-to-end within the CARAVAN ecosystem. On an independent temporal test set (2021-2024), AIFL achieves high predictive skill with a median modified Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE') of 0.66 and a median Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of 0.53. Benchmarking results show that AIFL is highly competitive with current state-of-the-art global systems, achieving comparable accuracy while maintaining a transparent and reproducible forcing pipeline. The model demonstrates exceptional reliability in extreme-event detection, providing a streamlined and operationally robust baseline for the global hydrological community.

Abstract: We study the implicit bias of momentum-based optimizers on homogeneous models. We first extend existing results on the implicit bias of steepest descent in homogeneous models to normalized steepest descent with an optional learning rate schedule. We then show that for smooth homogeneous models, momentum steepest descent algorithms like Muon (spectral norm), MomentumGD ($\ell_2$ norm), and Signum ($\ell_\infty$ norm) are approximate steepest descent trajectories under a decaying learning rate schedule, proving that these algorithms too have a bias towards KKT points of the corresponding margin maximization problem. We extend the analysis to Adam (without the stability constant), which maximizes the $\ell_\infty$ margin, and to Muon-Signum and Muon-Adam, which maximize a hybrid norm. Our experiments corroborate the theory and show that the identity of the margin maximized depends on the choice of optimizer. Overall, our results extend earlier lines of work on steepest descent in homogeneous models and momentum-based optimizers in linear models.

Abstract: Recent success in natural language processing has motivated growing interest in large-scale foundation models for neuroimaging data. Such models often require discretization of continuous neural time series data, a process referred to as 'tokenization'. However, the impact of different tokenization strategies for neural data is currently poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of sample-level tokenization strategies for transformer-based large neuroimaging models (LNMs) applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We compare learnable and non-learnable tokenizers by examining their signal reconstruction fidelity and their impact on subsequent foundation modeling performance (token prediction, biological plausibility of generated data, preservation of subject-specific information, and performance on downstream tasks). For the learnable tokenizer, we introduce a novel approach based on an autoencoder. Experiments were conducted on three publicly available MEG datasets spanning different acquisition sites, scanners, and experimental paradigms. Our results show that both learnable and non-learnable discretization schemes achieve high reconstruction accuracy and broadly comparable performance across most evaluation criteria, suggesting that simple fixed sample-level tokenization strategies can be used in the development of neural foundation models. The code is available at https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/Cho2026_Tokenizer.

Abstract: In this work, we apply and compare two state-of-the-art eXplainability Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, the Integrated Gradients (IG) and the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), that explain the fault diagnosis decisions of a highly accurate Long Short-Time Memory (LSTM) classifier. The classifier is trained to detect faults in a benchmark non-linear chemical process, the Tennessee Eastman Process (TEP). It is highlighted how XAI methods can help identify the subsystem of the process where the fault occurred. Using our knowledge of the process, we note that in most cases the same features are indicated as the most important for the decision, while insome cases the SHAP method seems to be more informative and closer to the root cause of the fault. Finally, since the used XAI methods are model-agnostic, the proposed approach is not limited to the specific process and can also be used in similar problems.

Motivation: 现有的差分TD学习收敛性证明需要依赖于状态访问计数的局部时钟学习率，这在实践中并不使用，也不适用于表格之外的一般设置。这一局限性阻碍了差分TD算法的实际应用和理论发展。

Conclusion: 这些结果加强了差分TD学习的理论基础，使其收敛性分析与实际实现更加接近，推动了差分TD算法在平均奖励强化学习中的广泛应用。

Abstract: The average reward is a fundamental performance metric in reinforcement learning (RL) focusing on the long-run performance of an agent. Differential temporal difference (TD) learning algorithms are a major advance for average reward RL as they provide an efficient online method to learn the value functions associated with the average reward in both on-policy and off-policy settings. However, existing convergence guarantees require a local clock in learning rates tied to state visit counts, which practitioners do not use and does not extend beyond tabular settings. We address this limitation by proving the almost sure convergence of on-policy $n$-step differential TD for any $n$ using standard diminishing learning rates without a local clock. We then derive three sufficient conditions under which off-policy $n$-step differential TD also converges without a local clock. These results strengthen the theoretical foundations of differential TD and bring its convergence analysis closer to practical implementations.

Result: SPOI-AE比传统算法更好地重建输入sPA像素，提供生物学上一致的光学参数、色团浓度和组织血氧饱和度估计；在模拟小鼠淋巴结体模上的验证显示其解混准确性。

Conclusion: SPOI-AE能够有效解决sPA成像中的反演和解混问题，为无创获取组织结构和分子信息提供了新方法。

Abstract: Accurate estimation of the relative concentrations of chromophores in a spectroscopic photoacoustic (sPA) image can reveal immense structural, functional, and molecular information about physiological processes. However, due to nonlinearities and ill-posedness inherent to sPA imaging, concentration estimation is intractable. The Spectroscopic Photoacoustic Optical Inversion Autoencoder (SPOI-AE) aims to address the sPA optical inversion and spectral unmixing problems without assuming linearity. Herein, SPOI-AE was trained and tested on \textit{in vivo} mouse lymph node sPA images with unknown ground truth chromophore concentrations. SPOI-AE better reconstructs input sPA pixels than conventional algorithms while providing biologically coherent estimates for optical parameters, chromophore concentrations, and the percent oxygen saturation of tissue. SPOI-AE's unmixing accuracy was validated using a simulated mouse lymph node phantom ground truth.

Conclusion: 本文提出的算法在技术上具有创新性，显著改善了奖励无关探索的实用性，同时为奖励自由探索提供了理论上的完整界限

Abstract: We study reward-free and reward-agnostic exploration in episodic finite-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs), where an agent explores an unknown environment without observing external rewards. Reward-free exploration aims to enable $ε$-optimal policies for any reward revealed after exploration, while reward-agnostic exploration targets $ε$-optimality for rewards drawn from a small finite class. In the reward-agnostic setting, Li, Yan, Chen, and Fan achieve minimax sample complexity, but only for restrictively small accuracy parameter $ε$. We propose a new algorithm that significantly relaxes the requirement on $ε$. Our approach is novel and of technical interest by itself. Our algorithm employs an online learning procedure with carefully designed rewards to construct an exploration policy, which is used to gather data sufficient for accurate dynamics estimation and subsequent computation of an $ε$-optimal policy once the reward is revealed. Finally, we establish a tight lower bound for reward-free exploration, closing the gap between known upper and lower bounds.

Abstract: Evaluating machine unlearning methods remains technically challenging, with recent benchmarks requiring complex setups and significant engineering overhead. We introduce a unified and extensible benchmarking suite that simplifies the evaluation of unlearning algorithms using the KLoM (KL divergence of Margins) metric.

By standardizing setup and metrics, it enables reproducible, scalable, and fair comparison across unlearning methods.

Abstract: Releasing data once and for all under noninteractive Local Differential Privacy (LDP) enables complete data reusability, but the resulting noise may create bias in subsequent analyses. In this work, we leverage the Weierstrass transform to characterize this bias in binary classification. We prove that inverting this transform leads to a bias-correction method to compute unbiased estimates of nonlinear functions on examples released under LDP. We then build a novel stochastic gradient descent algorithm called Inverse Weierstrass Private SGD (IWP-SGD). It converges to the true population risk minimizer at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$, with $n$ the number of examples. We empirically validate IWP-SGD on binary classification tasks using synthetic and real-world datasets.

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fine-tunes large models by learning low-rank updates on top of frozen weights, dramatically reducing trainable parameters and memory. In this work, we address the gap between training with full steps with low-rank projections (SVDLoRA) and LoRA fine-tuning. We propose LoRSum, a memory-efficient subroutine that closes this gap for gradient descent by casting LoRA optimization as a proximal sub-problem and solving it efficiently with alternating least squares updates, which we prove to be an implicit block power method. We recover several recently proposed preconditioning methods for LoRA as special cases, and show that LoRSum can also be used for updating a low-rank momentum. In order to address full steps with preconditioned gradient descent, we propose a scaled variant of LoRSum that uses structured metrics such as K-FAC and Shampoo, and we show that storing the diagonal of these metrics still allows them to perform well while remaining memory-efficient. Experiments on a synthetic task, CIFAR-100, and language-model fine-tuning on GLUE, SQuAD v2, and WikiText-103, show that our method can match or improve LoRA baselines given modest compute overhead, while avoiding full-matrix SVD projections and retaining LoRA-style parameter efficiency.

TL;DR: HPMixer提出了一种处理长时序预测中周期模式与残差动态的分离但互补的方法，通过可学习周期模块和可学习平稳小波变换分别建模周期性和残差，在标准基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在长期多元时间序列预测中，有效捕捉周期模式和残差动态至关重要。为解决标准深度学习基准设置下的这一问题，需要提出更有效的框架。

Method: HPMixer采用分离但互补的方式建模周期性和残差：周期组件使用可学习周期模块和通道MLP增强表达力；残差组件通过可学习平稳小波变换提取稳定频率域表示；使用通道混合编码器建模通道间依赖，并通过两级非重叠分层补丁机制捕获粗粒度和细粒度残差变化。

Result: 在标准多元基准测试上的大量实验表明，HPMixer相比近期基线方法取得了竞争性或最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: 通过整合分离的周期性建模和结构化、多尺度的残差学习，HPMixer为长期多元时间序列预测提供了一个有效的框架。

Abstract: In long-term multivariate time series forecasting, effectively capturing both periodic patterns and residual dynamics is essential. To address this within standard deep learning benchmark settings, we propose the Hierarchical Patching Mixer (HPMixer), which models periodicity and residuals in a decoupled yet complementary manner. The periodic component utilizes a learnable cycle module [7] enhanced with a nonlinear channel-wise MLP for greater expressiveness. The residual component is processed through a Learnable Stationary Wavelet Transform (LSWT) to extract stable, shift-invariant frequency-domain representations. Subsequently, a channel-mixing encoder models explicit inter-channel dependencies, while a two-level non-overlapping hierarchical patching mechanism captures coarse- and fine-scale residual variations. By integrating decoupled periodicity modeling with structured, multi-scale residual learning, HPMixer provides an effective framework. Extensive experiments on standard multivariate benchmarks demonstrate that HPMixer achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance compared to recent baselines.

Abstract: One of the central challenges in the computational analysis of liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) data is to identify the compounds underlying the output spectra. In recent years, this problem is increasingly tackled using deep learning methods. A common strategy involves predicting a molecular fingerprint vector from an input mass spectrum, which is then used to search for matches in a chemical compound database. While various loss functions are employed in training these predictive models, their impact on model performance remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigate commonly used loss functions, deriving novel regret bounds that characterize when Bayes-optimal decisions for these objectives must diverge. Our results reveal a fundamental trade-off between the two objectives of (1) fingerprint similarity and (2) molecular retrieval. Optimizing for more accurate fingerprint predictions typically worsens retrieval results, and vice versa. Our theoretical analysis shows this trade-off depends on the similarity structure of candidate sets, providing guidance for loss function and fingerprint selection.

TL;DR: 本文研究了使用强化学习合成参数化量子电路，实现了从纯离散门选择扩展到包含连续单量子比特旋转的量子态制备。比较了一阶段（联合选择门类型、作用量子位和旋转角度）和两阶段（先离散电路提案后角度优化）两种训练方式，发现PPO算法成功而A2C失败，一阶段PPO在计算效率和实用性上表现更佳，但可扩展性在λ≈3-4时开始下降。

Motivation: 推动量子电路自动化合成方法的发展，实现对包含连续参数的单量子比特旋转的量子态制备，并通过强化学习在离散与连续参数的混合空间中寻找最优电路结构，以提升量子计算算法的效率与实用性。

Method: 扩展DQCS方法，引入连续单量子比特旋转（Rx, Ry, Rz），比较一阶段强化学习agent（联合选择门类型、作用量子位和旋转角度）和两阶段方法（先用离散门产生电路，再用Adam优化旋转角度）。使用Gymnasium和PennyLane平台评估PPO和A2C算法在2-10量子位系统上的表现，λ参数范围1-5。

Result: PPO在稳定超参数下学习成功（一阶段学习率5×10⁻⁴，保真度误差阈值0.01；两阶段学习率10⁻⁴），A2C无法学习有效策略。两种方法能可靠重构计算基态（成功率83%-99%）和贝尔态（成功率61%-77%），但可扩展性在λ≈3-4时饱和，对于10量子位系统即使λ=2也无法扩展。两阶段方法准确性提升有限但运行时间增加约3倍。

Conclusion: 针对固定计算预算，一阶段PPO策略更具实用性，提供了具体合成电路示例，并与经典变分方法对比，指出了提升可扩展性的方向。

Abstract: We extend directed quantum circuit synthesis (DQCS) with reinforcement learning from purely discrete gate selection to parameterized quantum state preparation with continuous single-qubit rotations \(R_x\), \(R_y\), and \(R_z\). We compare two training regimes: a one-stage agent that jointly selects the gate type, the affected qubit(s), and the rotation angle; and a two-stage variant that first proposes a discrete circuit and subsequently optimizes the rotation angles with Adam using parameter-shift gradients. Using Gymnasium and PennyLane, we evaluate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Advantage Actor--Critic (A2C) on systems comprising two to ten qubits and on targets of increasing complexity with \(λ\) ranging from one to five. Whereas A2C does not learn effective policies in this setting, PPO succeeds under stable hyperparameters (one-stage: learning rate approximately \(5\times10^{-4}\) with a self-fidelity-error threshold of 0.01; two-stage: learning rate approximately \(10^{-4}\)). Both approaches reliably reconstruct computational basis states (between 83\% and 99\% success) and Bell states (between 61\% and 77\% success). However, scalability saturates for \(λ\) of approximately three to four and does not extend to ten-qubit targets even at \(λ=2\). The two-stage method offers only marginal accuracy gains while requiring around three times the runtime. For practicality under a fixed compute budget, we therefore recommend the one-stage PPO policy, provide explicit synthesized circuits, and contrast with a classical variational baseline to outline avenues for improved scalability.

Abstract: This paper presents a capacity-constrained incentive-based demand response approach for residential smart grids. It aims to maintain electricity grid capacity limits and prevent congestion by financially incentivising end users to reduce or shift their energy consumption. The proposed framework adopts a hierarchical architecture in which a service provider adjusts hourly incentive rates based on wholesale electricity prices and aggregated residential load. The financial interests of both the service provider and end users are explicitly considered. A deep reinforcement learning approach is employed to learn optimal real-time incentive rates under explicit capacity constraints. Heterogeneous user preferences are modelled through appliance-level home energy management systems and dissatisfaction costs. Using real-world residential electricity consumption and price data from three households, simulation results show that the proposed approach effectively reduces peak demand and smooths the aggregated load profile. This leads to an approximately 22.82% reduction in the peak-to-average ratio compared to the no-demand-response case.

Method: 采用带惩罚项的最小二乘优化框架，将目标学习任务表述为最小化目标数据集的平方误差，同时惩罚学习模型与预训练模型之间的距离。提出简单的去偏校正因子来减少过参数化偏差。

Result: 分析表明：当过参数化预训练模型数量足够多时能够改善转移学习；但过参数化偏差（最小L2范数解在高维参数空间中受限于训练示例张成的小子空间）会损害学习效果。提出的乘性校正因子能有效减少偏差，更好地利用多个预训练模型。

Conclusion: 使用多个过参数化预训练模型对转移学习有益，但需要克服过参数化偏差。提出的简单去偏方法能够减轻这种偏差，使系统能够更有效地利用更多预训练模型学习目标预测器。

Abstract: We study transfer learning for a linear regression task using several least-squares pretrained models that can be overparameterized.
  We formulate the target learning task as optimization that minimizes squared errors on the target dataset with penalty on the distance of the learned model from the pretrained models. We analytically formulate the test error of the learned target model and provide the corresponding empirical evaluations.
  Our results elucidate when using more pretrained models can improve transfer learning. Specifically, if the pretrained models are overparameterized, using sufficiently many of them is important for beneficial transfer learning. However, the learning may be compromised by overparameterization bias of pretrained models, i.e., the minimum $\ell_2$-norm solution's restriction to a small subspace spanned by the training examples in the high-dimensional parameter space. We propose a simple debiasing via multiplicative correction factor that can reduce the overparameterization bias and leverage more pretrained models to learn a target predictor.

Abstract: Safe reinforcement learning (Safe RL) aims to ensure policy performance while satisfying safety constraints. However, most existing Safe RL methods assume benign environments, making them vulnerable to adversarial perturbations commonly encountered in real-world settings. In addition, existing gradient-based adversarial attacks typically require access to the policy's gradient information, which is often impractical in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose an adversarial attack framework to reveal vulnerabilities of Safe RL policies. Using expert demonstrations and black-box environment interaction, our framework learns a constraint model and a surrogate (learner) policy, enabling gradient-based attack optimization without requiring the victim policy's internal gradients or the ground-truth safety constraints. We further provide theoretical analysis establishing feasibility and deriving perturbation bounds. Experiments on multiple Safe RL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach under limited privileged access.

Abstract: The inverse design of RNA three-dimensional (3D) structures is crucial for engineering functional RNAs in synthetic biology and therapeutics. While recent deep learning approaches have advanced this field, they are typically optimized and evaluated using native sequence recovery, which is a limited surrogate for structural fidelity, since different sequences can fold into similar 3D structures and high recovery does not necessarily indicate correct folding. To address this limitation, we propose RIDER, an RNA Inverse DEsign framework with Reinforcement learning that directly optimizes for 3D structural similarity. First, we develop and pre-train a GNN-based generative diffusion model conditioned on the target 3D structure, achieving a 9% improvement in native sequence recovery over state-of-the-art methods. Then, we fine-tune the model with an improved policy gradient algorithm using four task-specific reward functions based on 3D self-consistency metrics. Experimental results show that RIDER improves structural similarity by over 100% across all metrics and discovers designs that are distinct from native sequences.

Motivation: 研究参数共享在变分量子电路中的复杂权衡，这种现象虽然能在减少参数的同时保持甚至提高电路表达能力，但参数共享如何影响优化景观却一直被忽视，这关系到量子机器学习在实际应用中的可行性。

Method: 进行了系统性实验分析，研究了参数共享梯度对优化地貌的影响；开发了新型梯度欺骗检测算法；建立了量化框架来衡量量子电路中的优化难度；评估了传统梯度优化器(Adam、SGD)在参数共享增加时的表现。

Result: 研究发现：1.增加参数共享程度会产生更复杂的解空间，梯度幅度增大且可测量的欺骗性比例提高；2.传统梯度优化器在参数共享增加时收敛性能显著下降，高度依赖于超参数选择；3.参数共享能将电路表达能力提高数个数量级，但代价是优化地貌欺骗性显著增加。

Conclusion: 参数共享在变分量子电路中存在根本性权衡——电路表达能力的提升伴随优化难度的显著增加，揭示了传统经典优化策略与量子参数景观之间的根本性不匹配，为实际应用中量子电路设计提供了重要考量指标。

Abstract: Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for quantum machine learning in the NISQ era. While parameter sharing in VQCs can reduce the parameter space dimensionality and potentially mitigate the barren plateau phenomenon, it introduces a complex trade-off that has been largely overlooked. This paper investigates how parameter sharing, despite creating better global optima with fewer parameters, fundamentally alters the optimization landscape through deceptive gradients -- regions where gradient information exists but systematically misleads optimizers away from global optima. Through systematic experimental analysis, we demonstrate that increasing degrees of parameter sharing generate more complex solution landscapes with heightened gradient magnitudes and measurably higher deceptiveness ratios. Our findings reveal that traditional gradient-based optimizers (Adam, SGD) show progressively degraded convergence as parameter sharing increases, with performance heavily dependent on hyperparameter selection. We introduce a novel gradient deceptiveness detection algorithm and a quantitative framework for measuring optimization difficulty in quantum circuits, establishing that while parameter sharing can improve circuit expressivity by orders of magnitude, this comes at the cost of significantly increased landscape deceptiveness. These insights provide important considerations for quantum circuit design in practical applications, highlighting the fundamental mismatch between classical optimization strategies and quantum parameter landscapes shaped by parameter sharing.

Abstract: We introduce MetaDOAR, a lightweight meta-controller that augments the Double Oracle / PSRO paradigm with a learned, partition-aware filtering layer and Q-value caching to enable scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning on very large cyber-network environments. MetaDOAR learns a compact state projection from per node structural embeddings to rapidly score and select a small subset of devices (a top-k partition) on which a conventional low-level actor performs focused beam search utilizing a critic agent. Selected candidate actions are evaluated with batched critic forwards and stored in an LRU cache keyed by a quantized state projection and local action identifiers, dramatically reducing redundant critic computation while preserving decision quality via conservative k-hop cache invalidation. Empirically, MetaDOAR attains higher player payoffs than SOTA baselines on large network topologies, without significant scaling issues in terms of memory usage or training time. This contribution provide a practical, theoretically motivated path to efficient hierarchical policy learning for large-scale networked decision problems.

Abstract: Inference-time algorithms are an emerging paradigm in which pre-trained models are used as subroutines to solve downstream tasks. Such algorithms have been proposed for tasks ranging from inverse problems and guided image generation to reasoning. However, the methods currently deployed in practice are heuristics with a variety of failure modes -- and we have very little understanding of when these heuristics can be efficiently improved.
  In this paper, we consider the task of sampling from a reward-tilted diffusion model -- that is, sampling from $p^{\star}(x) \propto p(x) \exp(r(x))$ -- given a reward function $r$ and pre-trained diffusion oracle for $p$. We provide a fine-grained analysis of the computational tractability of this task for quadratic rewards $r(x) = x^\top A x + b^\top x$. We show that linear-reward tilts are always efficiently sampleable -- a simple result that seems to have gone unnoticed in the literature. We use this as a building block, along with a conceptually new ingredient -- the Hubbard-Stratonovich transform -- to provide an efficient algorithm for sampling from low-rank positive-definite quadratic tilts, i.e. $r(x) = x^\top A x$ where $A$ is positive-definite and of rank $O(1)$. For negative-definite tilts, i.e. $r(x) = - x^\top A x$ where $A$ is positive-definite, we prove that the problem is intractable even if $A$ is of rank 1 (albeit with exponentially-large entries).

Abstract: Urban demand forecasting plays a critical role in optimizing routing, dispatching, and congestion management within Intelligent Transportation Systems. By leveraging data fusion and analytics techniques, traffic demand forecasting serves as a key intermediate measure for identifying emerging spatial and temporal demand patterns. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by proposing two gradient boosting model variations, one for classiffication and one for regression, both capable of generating demand forecasts at various temporal horizons, from 5 minutes up to one hour. Our overall approach effectively integrates temporal and contextual features, enabling accurate predictions that are essential for improving the efficiency of shared (micro-) mobility services. To evaluate its effectiveness, we utilize open shared mobility data derived from e-scooter and e-bike networks in five metropolitan areas. These real-world datasets allow us to compare our approach with state-of-the-art methods as well as a Generative AI-based model, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing the complexities of modern urban mobility. Ultimately, our methodology offers novel insights on urban micro-mobility management, helping to tackle the challenges arising from rapid urbanization and thus, contributing to more sustainable, efficient, and livable cities.

Abstract: Modern AI models are not static. They go through multiple updates in their lifecycles. Thus, exploiting the model dynamics to create stronger Membership Inference (MI) attacks and tighter privacy audits are timely questions. Though the literature empirically shows that using a sequence of model updates can increase the power of MI attacks, rigorous analysis of the `optimal' MI attacks is limited to static models with infinite samples. Hence, we develop an `optimal' MI attack, SeMI*, that uses the sequence of model updates to identify the presence of a target inserted at a certain update step. For the empirical mean computation, we derive the optimal power of SeMI*, while accessing a finite number of samples with or without privacy. Our results retrieve the existing asymptotic analysis. We observe that having access to the model sequence avoids the dilution of MI signals unlike the existing attacks on the final model, where the MI signal vanishes as training data accumulates. Furthermore, an adversary can use SeMI* to tune both the insertion time and the canary to yield tighter privacy audits. Finally, we conduct experiments across data distributions and models trained or fine-tuned with DP-SGD demonstrating that practical variants of SeMI* lead to tighter privacy audits than the baselines.

Abstract: Cops and Robbers is a pursuit evasion game played on a graph, first introduced independently by Quilliot \cite{quilliot1978jeux} and Nowakowski and Winkler \cite{NOWAKOWSKI1983235} over four decades ago. A main interest in recent the literature is identifying the cop number of graph families. The cop number of a graph, $c(G)$, is defined as the minimum number of cops required to guarantee capture of the robber. Determining the cop number is computationally difficult and exact algorithms for this are typically restricted to small graph families. This paper investigates whether classical machine learning methods and graph neural networks can accurately predict a graph's cop number from its structural properties and identify which properties most strongly influence this prediction. Of the classical machine learning models, tree-based models achieve high accuracy in prediction despite class imbalance, whereas graph neural networks achieve comparable results without explicit feature engineering. The interpretability analysis shows that the most predictive features are related to node connectivity, clustering, clique structure, and width parameters, which aligns with known theoretical results. Our findings suggest that machine learning approaches can be used in complement with existing cop number algorithms by offering scalable approximations where computation is infeasible.

Abstract: Matched molecular pairs (MMPs) capture the local chemical edits that medicinal chemists routinely use to design analogs, but existing ML approaches either operate at the whole-molecule level with limited edit controllability or learn MMP-style edits from restricted settings and small models. We propose a variable-to-variable formulation of analog generation and train a foundation model on large-scale MMP transformations (MMPTs) to generate diverse variables conditioned on an input variable. To enable practical control, we develop prompting mechanisms that let the users specify preferred transformation patterns during generation. We further introduce MMPT-RAG, a retrieval-augmented framework that uses external reference analogs as contextual guidance to steer generation and generalize from project-specific series. Experiments on general chemical corpora and patent-specific datasets demonstrate improved diversity, novelty, and controllability, and show that our method recovers realistic analog structures in practical discovery scenarios.

Motivation: 当前追求 "完美再训练" 的机器遗忘方法存在严重隐私风险，攻击者可能通过删除请求重建整个数据集，需要重新定义既能保护隐私又支持基本功能的机器遗忘安全框架。

Method: 1. 展示重构攻击表明完美再训练的隐私漏洞；2. 分析现有定义的不足；3. 提出保护未删除数据的新安全定义；4. 证明新定义支持公告板、求和、统计学习等基本功能。

Result: 1. 发现完美再训练方法存在严重隐私漏洞，攻击者用ω(1)个数据点即可重建整个数据集；2. 现有定义要么易受攻击要么无法支持基本功能；3. 新定义有效保护未删除数据隐私并支持多种实用功能。

Conclusion: 追求完美再训练的机器遗忘框架存在根本性隐私缺陷，需要重新定义安全目标以保护未删除数据，提出的新定义在安全性和实用性间取得平衡，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove specific data points from a trained model, often striving to emulate "perfect retraining", i.e., producing the model that would have been obtained had the deleted data never been included. We demonstrate that this approach, and security definitions that enable it, carry significant privacy risks for the remaining (undeleted) data points. We present a reconstruction attack showing that for certain tasks, which can be computed securely without deletions, a mechanism adhering to perfect retraining allows an adversary controlling merely $ω(1)$ data points to reconstruct almost the entire dataset merely by issuing deletion requests. We survey existing definitions for machine unlearning, showing they are either susceptible to such attacks or too restrictive to support basic functionalities like exact summation. To address this problem, we propose a new security definition that specifically safeguards undeleted data against leakage caused by the deletion of other points. We show that our definition permits several essential functionalities, such as bulletin boards, summations, and statistical learning.

Abstract: Interpretability research on large language models (LLMs) has yielded important insights into model behaviour, yet recurring pitfalls persist: findings that do not generalise, and causal interpretations that outrun the evidence. Our position is that causal inference specifies what constitutes a valid mapping from model activations to invariant high-level structures, the data or assumptions needed to achieve it, and the inferences it can support. Specifically, Pearl's causal hierarchy clarifies what an interpretability study can justify. Observations establish associations between model behaviour and internal components. Interventions (e.g., ablations or activation patching) support claims how these edits affect a behavioural metric (\eg, average change in token probabilities) over a set of prompts. However, counterfactual claims -- i.e., asking what the model output would have been for the same prompt under an unobserved intervention -- remain largely unverifiable without controlled supervision. We show how causal representation learning (CRL) operationalises this hierarchy, specifying which variables are recoverable from activations and under what assumptions. Together, these motivate a diagnostic framework that helps practitioners select methods and evaluations matching claims to evidence such that findings generalise.

Abstract: Latent space models are widely used for analyzing high-dimensional discrete data matrices, such as patient-feature matrices in electronic health records (EHRs), by capturing complex dependence structures through low-dimensional embeddings. However, estimation becomes challenging in the imbalanced regime, where one matrix dimension is much larger than the other. In EHR applications, cohort sizes are often limited by disease prevalence or data availability, whereas the feature space remains extremely large due to the breadth of medical coding system. Motivated by the increasing availability of external semantic embeddings, such as pre-trained embeddings of clinical concepts in EHRs, we propose a knowledge-embedded latent projection model that leverages semantic side information to regularize representation learning. Specifically, we model column embeddings as smooth functions of semantic embeddings via a mapping in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We develop a computationally efficient two-step estimation procedure that combines semantically guided subspace construction via kernel principal component analysis with scalable projected gradient descent. We establish estimation error bounds that characterize the trade-off between statistical error and approximation error induced by the kernel projection. Furthermore, we provide local convergence guarantees for our non-convex optimization procedure. Extensive simulation studies and a real-world EHR application demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个名为Construct-and-Refine（CaR）的新框架，旨在解决神经求解器在处理复杂约束路由问题时效率不足的问题。CaR采用显式的基于学习的可行性细化方法，通过联合训练指导生成多样化且高质量的解决方案，并使用轻量化的改进过程显著提高了处理硬约束的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经求解器在简单路由问题上表现出色，但在复杂约束条件下，现有的通过可行性掩码或隐式可行性感知的约束处理方案效率低下，不适用于硬约束。因此，需要一种通用且高效的约束处理框架来提升神经路由求解器在复杂约束场景下的性能。

Method: CaR框架采用显式的基于学习的可行性细化方法，设计了一个联合训练框架，指导构造模块（construction module）生成多样化且高质量的解决方案，这些方案适用于轻量化的改进过程（例如10步，而非之前工作中的5千步）。此外，CaR首次引入构造-改进共享表示（construction-improvement-shared representation），通过统一编码器实现跨范式的知识共享。

Result: 在典型的硬约束路由问题上评估CaR，结果显示CaR在可行性、解决方案质量和效率方面均优于现有的经典和神经状态求解器。

Conclusion: CaR是第一个通用且高效的神经路由求解器约束处理框架，基于显式的学习式可行性细化，能有效处理硬约束，并在多个指标上优于当前的最先进求解器。

Abstract: Neural solvers have achieved impressive progress in addressing simple routing problems, particularly excelling in computational efficiency. However, their advantages under complex constraints remain nascent, for which current constraint-handling schemes via feasibility masking or implicit feasibility awareness can be inefficient or inapplicable for hard constraints. In this paper, we present Construct-and-Refine (CaR), the first general and efficient constraint-handling framework for neural routing solvers based on explicit learning-based feasibility refinement. Unlike prior construction-search hybrids that target reducing optimality gaps through heavy improvements yet still struggle with hard constraints, CaR achieves efficient constraint handling by designing a joint training framework that guides the construction module to generate diverse and high-quality solutions well-suited for a lightweight improvement process, e.g., 10 steps versus 5k steps in prior work. Moreover, CaR presents the first use of construction-improvement-shared representation, enabling potential knowledge sharing across paradigms by unifying the encoder, especially in more complex constrained scenarios. We evaluate CaR on typical hard routing constraints to showcase its broader applicability. Results demonstrate that CaR achieves superior feasibility, solution quality, and efficiency compared to both classical and neural state-of-the-art solvers.

TL;DR: 自主智能体工作流存在优化不稳定性问题：持续自主优化反而会降低分类器性能，这在类别低发生率时尤为严重。研究发现回顾性选择比主动干预更能有效防止系统崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主智能体工作流虽然前景广阔，但其故障模式尚不明确。本研究旨在探究优化不稳定性这一现象，即持续自主改进反而导致分类器性能下降的问题。

Method: 使用Pythia开放源码框架进行自动提示优化，评估三种不同发生率（23%、12%、3%）的临床症状。比较了两种干预策略：指导智能体（主动重定向优化）和选择智能体（回顾性选择最佳迭代）。

Result: 在3%低发生率时，系统达到95%准确率却未能检测到任何阳性病例，这是标准评估指标易忽视的故障模式。指导智能体会加剧过拟合，而选择智能体能成功防止灾难性故障，在脑雾检测上超越专家词典331%，在胸痛检测上提升7%。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了自主AI系统的关键故障模式，证明在低发生率分类任务中，回顾性选择策略比主动干预更能有效稳定系统性能。

Abstract: Autonomous agentic workflows that iteratively refine their own behavior hold considerable promise, yet their failure modes remain poorly characterized. We investigate optimization instability, a phenomenon in which continued autonomous improvement paradoxically degrades classifier performance, using Pythia, an open-source framework for automated prompt optimization. Evaluating three clinical symptoms with varying prevalence (shortness of breath at 23%, chest pain at 12%, and Long COVID brain fog at 3%), we observed that validation sensitivity oscillated between 1.0 and 0.0 across iterations, with severity inversely proportional to class prevalence. At 3% prevalence, the system achieved 95% accuracy while detecting zero positive cases, a failure mode obscured by standard evaluation metrics. We evaluated two interventions: a guiding agent that actively redirected optimization, amplifying overfitting rather than correcting it, and a selector agent that retrospectively identified the best-performing iteration successfully prevented catastrophic failure. With selector agent oversight, the system outperformed expert-curated lexicons on brain fog detection by 331% (F1) and chest pain by 7%, despite requiring only a single natural language term as input. These findings characterize a critical failure mode of autonomous AI systems and demonstrate that retrospective selection outperforms active intervention for stabilization in low-prevalence classification tasks.

Abstract: The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) is reshaping the landscape of automatic assessment in education. While these systems demonstrate substantial advantages in adaptability to diverse question types and flexibility in output formats, they also introduce new challenges related to output uncertainty, stemming from the inherently probabilistic nature of LLMs. Output uncertainty is an inescapable challenge in automatic assessment, as assessment results often play a critical role in informing subsequent pedagogical actions, such as providing feedback to students or guiding instructional decisions. Unreliable or poorly calibrated uncertainty estimates can lead to unstable downstream interventions, potentially disrupting students' learning processes and resulting in unintended negative consequences. To systematically understand this challenge and inform future research, we benchmark a broad range of uncertainty quantification methods in the context of LLM-based automatic assessment. Although the effectiveness of these methods has been demonstrated in many tasks across other domains, their applicability and reliability in educational settings, particularly for automatic grading, remain underexplored. Through comprehensive analyses of uncertainty behaviors across multiple assessment datasets, LLM families, and generation control settings, we characterize the uncertainty patterns exhibited by LLMs in grading scenarios. Based on these findings, we evaluate the strengths and limitations of different uncertainty metrics and analyze the influence of key factors, including model families, assessment tasks, and decoding strategies, on uncertainty estimates. Our study provides actionable insights into the characteristics of uncertainty in LLM-based automatic assessment and lays the groundwork for developing more reliable and effective uncertainty-aware grading systems in the future.

Abstract: Adapting one's thought process based on corrective feedback is an essential ability in human learning, particularly in collaborative settings. In contrast, the current large language model training paradigm relies heavily on modeling vast, static corpora. While effective for knowledge acquisition, it overlooks the interactive feedback loops essential for models to adapt dynamically to their context. In this work, we propose a framework that treats this interactive in-context learning ability not as an emergent property, but as a distinct, trainable skill. We introduce a scalable method that transforms single-turn verifiable tasks into multi-turn didactic interactions driven by information asymmetry. We first show that current flagship models struggle to integrate corrective feedback on hard reasoning tasks. We then demonstrate that models trained with our approach dramatically improve the ability to interactively learn from language feedback. More specifically, the multi-turn performance of a smaller model nearly reaches that of a model an order of magnitude larger. We also observe robust out-of-distribution generalization: interactive training on math problems transfers to diverse domains like coding, puzzles and maze navigation. Our qualitative analysis suggests that this improvement is due to an enhanced in-context plasticity. Finally, we show that this paradigm offers a unified path to self-improvement. By training the model to predict the teacher's critiques, effectively modeling the feedback environment, we convert this external signal into an internal capability, allowing the model to self-correct even without a teacher.

TL;DR: GPSBench是一个包含57,800个样本、17个任务的基准数据集，用于评估LLMs的地理空间推理能力，发现模型在真实世界地理推理上比几何计算更可靠，且地理知识呈分层下降趋势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs越来越多地应用于导航、机器人等与物理世界交互的场景，强大的地理空间推理能力变得至关重要，但LLMs在GPS坐标和真实世界地理推理方面的能力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 引入GPSBench数据集，包含57,800个样本和17个任务，涵盖几何坐标操作（如距离和方位角计算）以及与世界知识结合的推理。评估了14个最先进的LLMs，专注于模型内在能力而非工具使用。

Result: LLMs在GPS推理方面仍然具有挑战性，不同任务间存在显著差异：模型在真实世界地理推理上通常比几何计算更可靠。地理知识呈分层下降趋势，国家级别表现强，城市级别定位弱。坐标噪声的鲁棒性表明模型真正理解坐标而非记忆。GPS坐标增强可以改善下游地理空间任务，微调在几何计算提升与世界知识退化之间存在权衡。

Conclusion: GPSBench为评估和改进LLMs的地理空间推理能力提供了基础，揭示了当前模型在这一领域的局限性，并展示了坐标增强和微调等方法的潜力与权衡。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in applications that interact with the physical world, such as navigation, robotics, or mapping, making robust geospatial reasoning a critical capability. Despite that, LLMs' ability to reason about GPS coordinates and real-world geography remains underexplored. We introduce GPSBench, a dataset of 57,800 samples across 17 tasks for evaluating geospatial reasoning in LLMs, spanning geometric coordinate operations (e.g., distance and bearing computation) and reasoning that integrates coordinates with world knowledge. Focusing on intrinsic model capabilities rather than tool use, we evaluate 14 state-of-the-art LLMs and find that GPS reasoning remains challenging, with substantial variation across tasks: models are generally more reliable at real-world geographic reasoning than at geometric computations. Geographic knowledge degrades hierarchically, with strong country-level performance but weak city-level localization, while robustness to coordinate noise suggests genuine coordinate understanding rather than memorization. We further show that GPS-coordinate augmentation can improve in downstream geospatial tasks, and that finetuning induces trade-offs between gains in geometric computation and degradation in world knowledge.

Abstract: Modern AI agents are powerful but often fail to align with the idiosyncratic, evolving preferences of individual users. Prior approaches typically rely on static datasets, either training implicit preference models on interaction history or encoding user profiles in external memory. However, these approaches struggle with new users and with preferences that change over time. We introduce Personalized Agents from Human Feedback (PAHF), a framework for continual personalization in which agents learn online from live interaction using explicit per-user memory. PAHF operationalizes a three-step loop: (1) seeking pre-action clarification to resolve ambiguity, (2) grounding actions in preferences retrieved from memory, and (3) integrating post-action feedback to update memory when preferences drift. To evaluate this capability, we develop a four-phase protocol and two benchmarks in embodied manipulation and online shopping. These benchmarks quantify an agent's ability to learn initial preferences from scratch and subsequently adapt to persona shifts. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results show that integrating explicit memory with dual feedback channels is critical: PAHF learns substantially faster and consistently outperforms both no-memory and single-channel baselines, reducing initial personalization error and enabling rapid adaptation to preference shifts.

Abstract: Driven by our mission of "uplifting the world with memory," this paper explores the design concept of "memory" that is essential for achieving artificial superintelligence (ASI). Rather than proposing novel methods, we focus on several alternative approaches whose potential benefits are widely imaginable, yet have remained largely unexplored. The currently dominant paradigm, which can be termed "extract then store," involves extracting information judged to be useful from experiences and saving only the extracted content. However, this approach inherently risks the loss of information, as some valuable knowledge particularly for different tasks may be discarded in the extraction process. In contrast, we emphasize the "store then on-demand extract" approach, which seeks to retain raw experiences and flexibly apply them to various tasks as needed, thus avoiding such information loss. In addition, we highlight two further approaches: discovering deeper insights from large collections of probabilistic experiences, and improving experience collection efficiency by sharing stored experiences. While these approaches seem intuitively effective, our simple experiments demonstrate that this is indeed the case. Finally, we discuss major challenges that have limited investigation into these promising directions and propose research topics to address them.

Motivation: 解决自利智能体在多智能体强化学习中的合作问题是一个基本挑战。现有方法通常需要硬编码对手学习规则的假设或强制快慢时间尺度分离，这限制了方法的通用性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: 标准去中心化的序列模型强化学习结合对手多样性，为实现学习合作行为提供了可扩展的路径。序列模型的情境学习能力使智能体能够在无需预设假设的情况下自然发展出相互合作的策略。

Abstract: Achieving cooperation among self-interested agents remains a fundamental challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning. Recent work showed that mutual cooperation can be induced between "learning-aware" agents that account for and shape the learning dynamics of their co-players. However, existing approaches typically rely on hardcoded, often inconsistent, assumptions about co-player learning rules or enforce a strict separation between "naive learners" updating on fast timescales and "meta-learners" observing these updates. Here, we demonstrate that the in-context learning capabilities of sequence models allow for co-player learning awareness without requiring hardcoded assumptions or explicit timescale separation. We show that training sequence model agents against a diverse distribution of co-players naturally induces in-context best-response strategies, effectively functioning as learning algorithms on the fast intra-episode timescale. We find that the cooperative mechanism identified in prior work-where vulnerability to extortion drives mutual shaping-emerges naturally in this setting: in-context adaptation renders agents vulnerable to extortion, and the resulting mutual pressure to shape the opponent's in-context learning dynamics resolves into the learning of cooperative behavior. Our results suggest that standard decentralized reinforcement learning on sequence models combined with co-player diversity provides a scalable path to learning cooperative behaviors.

Result: 模拟实验中，在不同语义分歧程度下，核心防护减少分歧72-96%。在微调语言模型验证中，减少分歧51%

Conclusion: 该框架为可验证的智能体间通信提供了初步解决方案，通过统计认证和防护机制有效管理语义分歧

Abstract: Multiagent AI systems require consistent communication, but we lack methods to verify that agents share the same understanding of the terms used. Natural language is interpretable but vulnerable to semantic drift, while learned protocols are efficient but opaque. We propose a certification protocol based on the stimulus-meaning model, where agents are tested on shared observable events and terms are certified if empirical disagreement falls below a statistical threshold. In this protocol, agents restricting their reasoning to certified terms ("core-guarded reasoning") achieve provably bounded disagreement. We also outline mechanisms for detecting drift (recertification) and recovering shared vocabulary (renegotiation). In simulations with varying degrees of semantic divergence, core-guarding reduces disagreement by 72-96%. In a validation with fine-tuned language models, disagreement is reduced by 51%. Our framework provides a first step towards verifiable agent-to-agent communication.

Abstract: Automated feature engineering (AFE) enables AI systems to autonomously construct high-utility representations from raw tabular data. However, existing AFE methods rely on statistical heuristics, yielding brittle features that fail under distribution shift. We introduce CAFE, a framework that reformulates AFE as a causally-guided sequential decision process, bridging causal discovery with reinforcement learning-driven feature construction. Phase I learns a sparse directed acyclic graph over features and the target to obtain soft causal priors, grouping features as direct, indirect, or other based on their causal influence with respect to the target. Phase II uses a cascading multi-agent deep Q-learning architecture to select causal groups and transformation operators, with hierarchical reward shaping and causal group-level exploration strategies that favor causally plausible transformations while controlling feature complexity. Across 15 public benchmarks (classification with macro-F1; regression with inverse relative absolute error), CAFE achieves up to 7% improvement over strong AFE baselines, reduces episodes-to-convergence, and delivers competitive time-to-target. Under controlled covariate shifts, CAFE reduces performance drop by ~4x relative to a non-causal multi-agent baseline, and produces more compact feature sets with more stable post-hoc attributions. These findings underscore that causal structure, used as a soft inductive prior rather than a rigid constraint, can substantially improve the robustness and efficiency of automated feature engineering.

Abstract: Causal discovery seeks to uncover causal relations from data, typically represented as causal graphs, and is essential for predicting the effects of interventions. While expert knowledge is required to construct principled causal graphs, many statistical methods have been proposed to leverage observational data with varying formal guarantees. Causal Assumption-based Argumentation (ABA) is a framework that uses symbolic reasoning to ensure correspondence between input constraints and output graphs, while offering a principled way to combine data and expertise. We explore the use of large language models (LLMs) as imperfect experts for Causal ABA, eliciting semantic structural priors from variable names and descriptions and integrating them with conditional-independence evidence. Experiments on standard benchmarks and semantically grounded synthetic graphs demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, and we additionally introduce an evaluation protocol to mitigate memorisation bias when assessing LLMs for causal discovery.

Conclusion: FoT是一个强大的通用框架，能够解锁推理方案的潜在性能，促进未来动态和高效推理方案的发展。作者已开源代码以支持后续研究。

Abstract: Prompting schemes such as Chain of Thought, Tree of Thoughts, and Graph of Thoughts can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, most existing schemes require users to define static, problem-specific reasoning structures that lack adaptability to dynamic or unseen problem types. Additionally, these schemes are often under-optimized in terms of hyperparameters, prompts, runtime, and prompting cost. To address these limitations, we introduce Framework of Thoughts (FoT)--a general-purpose foundation framework for building and optimizing dynamic reasoning schemes. FoT comes with built-in features for hyperparameter tuning, prompt optimization, parallel execution, and intelligent caching, unlocking the latent performance potential of reasoning schemes. We demonstrate FoT's capabilities by implementing three popular schemes--Tree of Thoughts, Graph of Thoughts, and ProbTree--within FoT. We empirically show that FoT enables significantly faster execution, reduces costs, and achieves better task scores through optimization. We release our codebase to facilitate the development of future dynamic and efficient reasoning schemes.

Abstract: Can a machine write good poetry? Any positive answer raises fundamental questions about the nature and value of art. We report a seven-month poetry workshop in which a large language model was shaped into a digital poet through iterative in-context expert feedback, without retraining. Across sessions, the model developed a distinctive style and a coherent corpus, supported by quantitative and qualitative analyses, and it produced a pen name and author image. In a blinded authorship test with 50 humanities students and graduates (three AI poems and three poems by well-known poets each), judgments were at chance: human poems were labeled human 54% of the time and AI poems 52%, with 95% confidence intervals including 50%. After the workshop, a commercial publisher released a poetry collection authored by the model. These results show that workshop-style prompting can support long-horizon creative shaping and renew debates on creativity and authorship.

Based on these observations, an investigation is conducted to determine whether the Agent Skill paradigm provides similar benefits to small language models (SLMs). This question matters in industrial scenarios where continuous reliance on public APIs is infeasible due to data-security and budget constraints requirements, and where SLMs often show limited generalization in highly customized scenarios. This work introduces a formal mathematical definition of the Agent Skill process, followed by a systematic evaluation of language models of varying sizes across multiple use cases. The evaluation encompasses two open-source tasks and a real-world insurance claims data set. The results show that tiny models struggle with reliable skill selection, while moderately sized SLMs (approximately 12B - 30B) parameters) benefit substantially from the Agent Skill approach. Moreover, code-specialized variants at around 80B parameters achieve performance comparable to closed-source baselines while improving GPU efficiency. Collectively, these findings provide a comprehensive and nuanced characterization of the capabilities and constraints of the framework, while providing actionable insights for the effective deployment of Agent Skills in SLM-centered environments.

Motivation: 现有AI智能体评估过于依赖单一成功率指标，无法全面反映在实际部署中的可靠性缺陷，如行为一致性、抗干扰能力、可预测失败模式等，这与安全关键系统的工程需求存在差距。

Method: 基于安全关键工程理念，提出了包含4个维度（一致性、鲁棒性、可预测性、安全性）的12个具体指标来分解智能体可靠性；在2个互补基准测试中评估了14个智能体模型。

Result: 研究发现，尽管最近的能力提升在标准基准上取得了进步，但对可靠性的改善有限，智能体在多个可靠性维度上仍存在持续局限性。

Conclusion: 新的度量指标体系能够补充传统评估方法，为理解智能体的表现、退化模式和失败机制提供分析工具，有助于更全面地评估智能体在实际部署中的可靠性。

Abstract: AI agents are increasingly deployed to execute important tasks. While rising accuracy scores on standard benchmarks suggest rapid progress, many agents still continue to fail in practice. This discrepancy highlights a fundamental limitation of current evaluations: compressing agent behavior into a single success metric obscures critical operational flaws. Notably, it ignores whether agents behave consistently across runs, withstand perturbations, fail predictably, or have bounded error severity. Grounded in safety-critical engineering, we provide a holistic performance profile by proposing twelve concrete metrics that decompose agent reliability along four key dimensions: consistency, robustness, predictability, and safety. Evaluating 14 agentic models across two complementary benchmarks, we find that recent capability gains have only yielded small improvements in reliability. By exposing these persistent limitations, our metrics complement traditional evaluations while offering tools for reasoning about how agents perform, degrade, and fail.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are rapidly reshaping medical imaging, shifting the field from narrowly trained, task-specific networks toward large, general-purpose models that can be adapted across modalities, anatomies, and clinical tasks. In this review, we synthesize the emerging landscape of medical imaging FMs along three major axes: principles of FM design, applications of FMs, and forward-looking challenges and opportunities. Taken together, this review provides a technically grounded, clinically aware, and future-facing roadmap for developing FMs that are not only powerful and versatile but also trustworthy and ready for responsible translation into clinical practice.

Conclusion: ROIX-Comp框架通过引入ROI驱动的提取策略和智能压缩方法，有效解决了大规模X-CT数据处理中的存储和传输难题，为高性能计算环境下的实时数据处理提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: In high-performance computing (HPC) environments, particularly in synchrotron radiation facilities, vast amounts of X-ray images are generated. Processing large-scale X-ray Computed Tomography (X-CT) datasets presents significant computational and storage challenges due to their high dimensionality and data volume. Traditional approaches often require extensive storage capacity and high transmission bandwidth, limiting real-time processing capabilities and workflow efficiency. To address these constraints, we introduce a region-of-interest (ROI)-driven extraction framework (ROIX-Comp) that intelligently compresses X-CT data by identifying and retaining only essential features. Our work reduces data volume while preserving critical information for downstream processing tasks. At pre-processing stage, we utilize error-bounded quantization to reduce the amount of data to be processed and therefore improve computational efficiencies. At the compression stage, our methodology combines object extraction with multiple state-of-the-art lossless and lossy compressors, resulting in significantly improved compression ratios. We evaluated this framework against seven X-CT datasets and observed a relative compression ratio improvement of 12.34x compared to the standard compression.

Abstract: Purpose: Kidney ureteroscopic navigation is challenging with a steep learning curve. However, current clinical training has major deficiencies, as it requires one-on-one feedback from experts and occurs in the operating room (OR). Therefore, there is a need for a phantom training system with automated feedback to greatly \revision{expand} training opportunities.
  Methods: We propose a novel, purely ureteroscope video-based scope localization framework that automatically identifies calyces missed by the trainee in a phantom kidney exploration. We use a slow, thorough, prior exploration video of the kidney to generate a reference reconstruction. Then, this reference reconstruction can be used to localize any exploration video of the same phantom.
  Results: In 15 exploration videos, a total of 69 out of 74 calyces were correctly classified. We achieve < 4mm camera pose localization error. Given the reference reconstruction, the system takes 10 minutes to generate the results for a typical exploration (1-2 minute long).
  Conclusion: We demonstrate a novel camera localization framework that can provide accurate and automatic feedback for kidney phantom explorations. We show its ability as a valid tool that enables out-of-OR training without requiring supervision from an expert.

Abstract: Accurate and computationally efficient 3D medical image segmentation remains a critical challenge in clinical workflows. Transformer-based architectures often demonstrate superior global contextual modeling but at the expense of excessive parameter counts and memory demands, restricting their clinical deployment. We propose RefineFormer3D, a lightweight hierarchical transformer architecture that balances segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency for volumetric medical imaging. The architecture integrates three key components: (i) GhostConv3D-based patch embedding for efficient feature extraction with minimal redundancy, (ii) MixFFN3D module with low-rank projections and depthwise convolutions for parameter-efficient feature extraction, and (iii) a cross-attention fusion decoder enabling adaptive multi-scale skip connection integration. RefineFormer3D contains only 2.94M parameters, substantially fewer than contemporary transformer-based methods. Extensive experiments on ACDC and BraTS benchmarks demonstrate that RefineFormer3D achieves 93.44\% and 85.9\% average Dice scores respectively, outperforming or matching state-of-the-art methods while requiring significantly fewer parameters. Furthermore, the model achieves fast inference (8.35 ms per volume on GPU) with low memory requirements, supporting deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. These results establish RefineFormer3D as an effective and scalable solution for practical 3D medical image segmentation.

Abstract: Generating diagnostic text from histopathology whole slide images (WSIs) is challenging due to the gigapixel scale of the input and the requirement for precise, domain specific language. We propose a hierarchical vision language framework that combines a frozen pathology foundation model with a Transformer decoder for report generation. To make WSI processing tractable, we perform multi resolution pyramidal patch selection (downsampling factors 2^3 to 2^6) and remove background and artifacts using Laplacian variance and HSV based criteria. Patch features are extracted with the UNI Vision Transformer and projected to a 6 layer Transformer decoder that generates diagnostic text via cross attention. To better represent biomedical terminology, we tokenize the output using BioGPT. Finally, we add a retrieval based verification step that compares generated reports with a reference corpus using Sentence BERT embeddings; if a high similarity match is found, the generated report is replaced with the retrieved ground truth reference to improve reliability.
