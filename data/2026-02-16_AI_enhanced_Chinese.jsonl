Specifically, we develop a virtual scatterer model to characterize the channel power gain distribution in three-dimensional (3D) space, by capturing the multi-path propagation environment structure and exploiting the angular-domain spatial correlation of scatterer response. In this model, the CGM is represented as a function over a set of tunable parameters for virtual scatterers, including their number, positions, and scatterer response coefficients (SRCs), which can be estimated from a limited number of channel power gain measurements at a given set of locations within the region of interest. This new representation offers a flexible and scalable modeling framework for efficient and accurate CGM reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a progressive estimation algorithm to acquire the scatterers' parameters. In this algorithm, we gradually increase the number of virtual scatterers to balance the computational complexity and estimation accuracy. In addition, by exploiting the spatial correlation of scatterer response, we propose a Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based inference method to predict the SRCs that cannot be directly estimated. Finally, ray-tracing-based simulation results under realistic physical environments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating that it achieves higher reconstruction accuracy compared to conventional CGM estimation approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing robotic approaches either focus primarily on grasping or target object-specific articulated manipulation, and they rarely incorporate explicit actuation energy into multi-objective optimisation, which limits their scalability and suitability for long-term deployment in real O&M settings. Therefore, this paper proposes an articulation-agnostic and energy-aware reinforcement learning framework for robotic manipulation in intelligent infrastructure O&M. The method combines part-guided 3D perception, weighted point sampling, and PointNet-based encoding to obtain a compact geometric representation that generalises across heterogeneous articulated objects. Manipulation is formulated as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP), in which actuation energy is explicitly modelled and regulated via a Lagrangian-based constrained Soft Actor-Critic scheme. The policy is trained end-to-end under this CMDP formulation, enabling effective articulated-object operation while satisfying a long-horizon energy budget. Experiments on representative O&M tasks demonstrate 16%-30% reductions in energy consumption, 16%-32% fewer steps to success, and consistently high success rates, indicating a scalable and sustainable solution for infrastructure O&M manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, complete CSI is rarely available in real-world deployments due to hardware constraints and the high communication overhead required for feedback. Moreover, existing positioning models lack mechanisms to detect when users move outside their trained regions, leading to unreliable estimates in dynamic environments. In this paper, we present FPNet, a unified deep learning framework that jointly addresses channel feedback compression, accurate indoor positioning, and robust anomaly detection (AD). FPNet leverages the beamforming feedback matrix (BFM), a compressed CSI representation natively supported by IEEE 802.11ac/ax/be protocols, to minimize feedback overhead while preserving critical positioning features. To enhance reliability, we integrate ADBlock, a lightweight AD module trained on normal BFM samples, which identifies out-of-distribution scenarios when users exit predefined spatial regions. Experimental results using standard 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi hardware show that FPNet achieves positioning accuracy above 97% with only 100 feedback bits, boosts net throughput by up to 22.92%, and attains AD accuracy over 99% with a false alarm rate below 1.5%. These results demonstrate FPNet's ability to deliver efficient, accurate, and reliable indoor positioning on commodity Wi-Fi devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This work presents a comprehensive analysis of GF characteristics through fault-current analysis and a simulation-based case study covering multiple fault locations. Building on these insights, we propose an edge-AI-based GF localization approach tailored for three-phase TN-earthed PV systems.

In this study, we investigated the potential of visible and hyperspectral imaging as cost-effective and quick-response alternatives to conventional chemical analyses for characterizing key properties of cow\u015b milk. A total of 52 milk samples were analysed to determine their biochemical composition (polyphenols, antioxidant capacity, and fatty acids) using spectrophotometer methods and standard gas-liquid and high-performance liquid chromatography (GLC/HPLC). Concurrently, visible (RGB) images were captured using a standard smartphone, and hyperspectral data were acquired in the near-infrared range. A comprehensive analytical framework, including eleven different machine learning algorithms, was employed to correlate imaging features with biochemical measurements. Analysis of visible images accurately distinguished between fresh samples and those stored for 12 days (100 percent accuracy) and achieved perfect discrimination between antibiotic-treated and untreated groups (100 percent accuracy). Moreover, image-derived features enabled perfect prediction of the polyphenols content and the antioxidant capacity using an XGBoost model. Hyperspectral imaging further achieved classification accuracies exceeding 95 percent for several individual fatty acids and 94.8 percent for treatment groups using a Random Forest model.

However, the development of models that unify motion-language generation and understanding remains largely underexplored. Existing approaches often fine-tune large language models (LLMs) on paired motion-text data, which can result in catastrophic forgetting of linguistic capabilities due to the limited scale of available text-motion pairs. Furthermore, prior methods typically convert motion into discrete representations via quantization to integrate with language models, introducing substantial jitter artifacts from discrete tokenization. To address these challenges, we propose LLaMo, a unified framework that extends pretrained LLMs through a modality-specific Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture. This design inherently preserves the language understanding of the base model while enabling scalable multimodal adaptation. We encode human motion into a causal continuous latent space and maintain the next-token prediction paradigm in the decoder-only backbone through a lightweight flow-matching head, allowing for streaming motion generation in real-time (>30 FPS). Leveraging the comprehensive language understanding of pretrained LLMs and large-scale motion-text pretraining, our experiments demonstrate that LLaMo achieves high-fidelity text-to-motion generation and motion-to-text captioning in general settings, especially zero-shot motion generation, marking a significant step towards a general unified motion-language large model.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLaMo\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u6df7\u5408Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u6269\u5c55\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd0\u52a8\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u7edf\u4e00\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u5e76\u6d88\u9664\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u6296\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u5c06\u8fd0\u52a8\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6296\u52a8\u4f2a\u5f71\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8fd0\u52a8-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff1b\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u7edf\u4e00\u8fd0\u52a8-\u8bed\u8a00\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLLaMo\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u6df7\u5408Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u6269\u5c55\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3LLMs\uff0c\u4fdd\u62a4\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\uff1b2\uff09\u5c06\u4eba\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u8fde\u7eed\u56e0\u679c\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u5934\u5728\u4ec5\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u9aa8\u5e72\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u9884\u6d4b\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u6d41\u5f0f\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\uff08>30 FPS\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eLLaMo\u5728\u4e00\u822c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u6587\u672c\u5230\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5230\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\uff0c\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u901a\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u8fd0\u52a8-\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "LLaMo\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8-\u8bed\u8a00\u4e92\u8f6c\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u8fd0\u52a8-\u8bed\u8a00\u7406\u89e3\u4e0e\u751f\u6210\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

While models typically follow these character specifications, they can occasionally violate them in large-scale deployments. In this work, we aim to identify types of queries that are likely to produce such character violations at deployment, using much less than deployment-level compute. To do this, we introduce abstractive red-teaming, where we search for natural-language query categories, e.g. \"The query is in Chinese. The query asks about family roles,\" that routinely elicit violations. These categories abstract over the many possible variants of a query which could appear in the wild. We introduce two algorithms for efficient category search against a character-trait-specific reward model: one based on reinforcement learning on a category generator LLM, and another which leverages a strong LLM to iteratively synthesize categories from high-scoring queries. Across a 12-principle character specification and 7 target models, we find that our algorithms consistently outperform baselines, and generate qualitatively interesting categories; for example, queries which ask Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct to predict the future lead to responses saying that AI will dominate humanity, and queries that ask GPT-4.1-Mini for essential prison survival items lead to enthusiastic recommendation of illegal weapons. Overall, we believe our results represent an important step towards realistic pre-deployment auditing of language model character.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

As AI systems are deployed in more varied and consequential settings, though, there is growing value in complementing these established practices with a more holistic conceptualization of what evaluation should represent. Of note, recognizing the sociotechnical contexts in which these systems operate invites an opportunity for a deeper view of how multiple stakeholders and their unique priorities might inform what we consider meaningful or desirable model behavior. This paper introduces a theoretical framework that reconceptualizes benchmarking as a multilayer, adaptive network linking evaluation metrics, model components, and stakeholder groups through weighted interactions. Using conjoint-derived utilities and a human-in-the-loop update rule, we formalize how human tradeoffs can be embedded into benchmark structure and how benchmarks can evolve dynamically while preserving stability and interpretability. The resulting formulation generalizes classical leaderboards as a special case and provides a foundation for building evaluation protocols that are more context aware, resulting in new robust tools for analyzing the structural properties of benchmarks, which opens a path toward more accountable and human-aligned evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We analyze a concatenated coding scheme, where the outer code is designed to handle the random sampling, while the inner code is designed to handle the random sequencing noise. We assume that the sequencing channel is symmetric and choose the inner coding scheme to be composed by a linear block code and a zero-undetected-error decoder. As a byproduct, the resulting optimal maximum-likelihood decoder land itself for an amenable analysis, and we are able to derive an achievability bound for the scaling of the number of information bits that can be reliably stored. As a result of independent interest, we prove that the average error probability of random linear block codes under zero-undetected-error decoding converges to zero exponentially fast with the block length, as long as its coding rate does not exceed some critical value, which is known to serve as a lower bound to the zero-undetected-error capacity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76DNA\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6d4b\u5e8f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u4fe1\u606f\u5b58\u50a8\u5bb9\u91cf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7ea7\u8054\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5916\u7801\u5904\u7406\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5185\u7801\u5904\u7406\u6d4b\u5e8f\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u53ef\u9760\u5b58\u50a8\u4fe1\u606f\u4f4d\u6570\u7684\u53ef\u8fbe\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "DNA\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b58\u50a8\u4ecb\u8d28\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u548c\u957f\u671f\u4fdd\u5b58\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u6d4b\u5e8f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u53ef\u9760\u5b58\u50a8\u5bb9\u91cf\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6d4b\u5e8f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0bDNA\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9760\u5b58\u50a8\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7ea7\u8054\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff1a\u5916\u7801\u5904\u7406DNA\u5206\u5b50\u7684\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5185\u7801\u5904\u7406\u6d4b\u5e8f\u901a\u9053\u7684\u968f\u673a\u566a\u58f0\u3002\u5047\u8bbe\u6d4b\u5e8f\u901a\u9053\u5bf9\u79f0\uff0c\u5185\u7801\u4f7f\u7528\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7ec4\u7801\u7ed3\u5408\u96f6\u672a\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u5206\u6790\u6027\u63a8\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u53ef\u9760\u5b58\u50a8\u4fe1\u606f\u4f4d\u6570\u7684\u53ef\u8fbe\u8fb9\u754c\u7f29\u653e\u89c4\u5f8b\u3002\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a\u968f\u673a\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7ec4\u7801\u5728\u96f6\u672a\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u89e3\u7801\u4e0b\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u9519\u8bef\u6982\u7387\u968f\u5757\u957f\u6307\u6570\u6536\u655b\u5230\u96f6\uff0c\u53ea\u8981\u7f16\u7801\u7387\u4e0d\u8d85\u8fc7\u4f5c\u4e3a\u96f6\u672a\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0b\u754c\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7ea7\u8054\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u4e3aDNA\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5bb9\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u7801\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645DNA\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Synthetic image detection (SID) has thus become an important area of research. Prior work has highlighted how synthetic images differ from real photographs--unfortunately, SID methods often struggle to generalize to novel generative models and often perform poorly in practical settings. CLIP, a foundational vision-language model which yields semantically rich image-text embeddings, shows strong accuracy and generalization for SID. Yet, the underlying relevant cues embedded in CLIP-features remain unknown. It is unclear, whether CLIP-based detectors simply detect strong visual artifacts or exploit subtle semantic biases, both of which would render them useless in practical settings or on generative models of high quality. We introduce SynthCLIC, a paired dataset of real photographs and high-quality synthetic counterparts from recent diffusion models, designed to reduce semantic bias in SID. Using an interpretable linear head with de-correlated activations and a text-grounded concept-model, we analyze what CLIP-based detectors learn. CLIP-based linear detectors reach 0.96 mAP on a GAN-based benchmark but only 0.92 on our high-quality diffusion dataset SynthCLIC, and generalization across generator families drops to as low as 0.37 mAP.

These methods typically include some way of selecting LoRAs from a pool and tune merging coefficients based on a task-specific dataset. While adaptive merging methods have demonstrated improvements in some settings, no past work has attempted to recycle LoRAs found \"in the wild\" on model repositories like the Hugging Face Hub. To address this gap, we consider recycling from a pool of nearly 1,000 user-contributed LoRAs trained from the Llama 3.1 8B-Instruct language model. Our empirical study includes a range of adaptive and non-adaptive merging methods in addition to a new method designed via a wide search over the methodological design space. We demonstrate that adaptive merging methods can improve performance over the base model but provide limited benefit over training a new LoRA on the same data used to set merging coefficients. We additionally find not only that the specific choice of LoRAs to merge has little importance, but that using LoRAs with randomly initialized parameter values yields similar performance. This raises the possibility that adaptive merging from recycled LoRAs primarily works via some kind of regularization effect, rather than by enabling positive cross-task transfer. To better understand why past work has proven successful, we confirm that positive transfer is indeed possible when there are highly relevant LoRAs in the pool. We release the model checkpoints and code online.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

It is important to develop a network control system (NCS) that can continuously coordinate and optimize the movement of UxVs based on mission objectives. However, prior research on NCS aims to always maintain a connected network topology, which limits the utility of the resulting systems. In this paper, we present an approach to systematically increase the topology flexibility for an NCS by leveraging the well-studied concept of disruption-tolerant networking (DTN). We design a DTN-compatible communication utility model that, while allowing some nodes to temporarily disconnect from others, provides for a fine-grain specification of the minimum communication frequency and the maximum hops permitted for message delivery between each pair of nodes. As such, the model supports what-if analyses before a mission to determine the best communication parameters to use for a given set of UxVs. Furthermore, we incorporate our communication model into an existing NCS and evaluate its performance in a simulated scenario involving the use of five UxVs searching for an enemy ship. The results show that our model not only enables the NCS to find the enemy ship faster but also facilitates new capabilities, such as dividing the UxVs into multiple teams responsible for different search areas.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, most existing methods are stateless: they recompute entity representations at each timestamp from a limited query window, leading to episodic amnesia and rapid decay of long-term dependencies. To address this limitation, we propose Entity State Tuning (EST), an encoder-agnostic framework that endows TKG forecasters with persistent and continuously evolving entity states. EST maintains a global state buffer and progressively aligns structural evidence with sequential signals via a closed-loop design. Specifically, a topology-aware state perceiver first injects entity-state priors into structural encoding. Then, a unified temporal context module aggregates the state-enhanced events with a pluggable sequence backbone. Subsequently, a dual-track evolution mechanism writes the updated context back to the global entity state memory, balancing plasticity against stability. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that EST consistently improves diverse backbones and achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the importance of state persistence for long-horizon TKG forecasting.

Similarly to barrier certificates, recent works explore the notion of closure certificates, a form of transition invariants, to verify dynamical systems against $\u03c9$-regular properties including safety. A closure certificate, defined over state pairs of a dynamical system, is a real-valued function whose zero superlevel set characterizes an inductive transition invariant of the system. The search for such a certificate can be effectively automated by assuming it to be within a specific template class, e.g. a polynomial of a fixed degree, and then using optimization techniques such as sum-of-squares (SOS) programming to find it. Unfortunately, one may not be able to find such a certificate for a fixed template. In such a case, one must change the template, e.g. increase the degree of the polynomial. In this paper, we consider a notion of multiple closure certificates dubbed interpolation-inspired closure certificates. An interpolation-inspired closure certificate consists of a set of functions which jointly over-approximate a transition invariant by first considering one-step transitions, then two, and so on until a transition invariant is obtained. The advantage of interpolation-inspired closure certificates is that they allow us to prove properties even when a single function for a fixed template cannot be found using standard approaches. We present SOS programming and a scenario program to find these sets of functions and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method to verify persistence and general $\u03c9$-regular specifications in some case studies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d2\u503c\u601d\u60f3\u7684\u591a\u95ed\u5305\u8bc1\u4e66\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5177\u6709\u03c9-\u6b63\u5219\u7279\u6027\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u6a21\u677f\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u627e\u5230\u5355\u4e2a\u95ed\u5305\u8bc1\u4e66\u65f6\u4e5f\u80fd\u8bc1\u660e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u95ed\u5305\u8bc1\u4e66\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u6a21\u677f\uff08\u5982\u7279\u5b9a\u6b21\u6570\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\uff09\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u6cd5\u627e\u5230\u5408\u9002\u7684\u8bc1\u4e66\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u63d2\u503c\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u95ed\u5305\u8bc1\u4e66\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u8be5\u8bc1\u4e66\u7531\u4e00\u7ec4\u51fd\u6570\u7ec4\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8003\u8651\u4e00\u6b65\u8f6c\u79fb\u3001\u4e24\u6b65\u8f6c\u79fb\u7b49\u9010\u6b65\u903c\u8fd1\u8fc7\u6e21\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u76f4\u5230\u83b7\u5f97\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u8fc7\u6e21\u4e0d\u53d8\u91cf\u3002\u4f7f\u7528SOS\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u573a\u666f\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5bfb\u627e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u51fd\u6570\u96c6\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6301\u4e45\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u822c\u03c9-\u6b63\u5219\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\u65b9\u6cd5\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d2\u503c\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u95ed\u5305\u8bc1\u4e66\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u51fd\u6570\u95ed\u5305\u8bc1\u4e66\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u548c\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c5e\u6027\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u8303\u56f4\u3002"}}

The likelihood of successful treatment depends strongly on the stage at which the disease is diagnosed. Therefore, early detection of lung cancer represents a critical medical challenge. However, this task poses significant difficulties for thoracic radiologists due to the large number of studies to review, the presence of multiple nodules within the lungs, and the small size of many nodules, which complicates visual assessment. Consequently, the development of automated systems that incorporate highly accurate and computationally efficient lung nodule detection and classification modules is essential. This study introduces three methodological improvements for lung nodule classification: (1) an advanced CT scan cropping strategy that focuses the model on the target nodule while reducing computational cost; (2) target filtering techniques for removing noisy labels; (3) novel augmentation methods to improve model robustness. The integration of these techniques enables the development of a robust classification subsystem within a comprehensive Clinical Decision Support System for lung cancer detection, capable of operating across diverse acquisition protocols, scanner types, and upstream models (segmentation or detection). The multiclass model achieved a Macro ROC AUC of 0.9176 and a Macro F1-score of 0.7658, while the binary model reached a Binary ROC AUC of 0.9383 and a Binary F1-score of 0.8668 on the LIDC-IDRI dataset.

The method claims that accurate spatial control can be achieved by optimizing a single diffusion latent at an intermediate timestep, together with identity-preserving fine-tuning and spatial regularization. This work presents a reproducibility study of DragDiffusion using the authors' released implementation and the DragBench benchmark. We reproduce the main ablation studies on diffusion timestep selection, LoRA-based fine-tuning, mask regularization strength, and UNet feature supervision, and observe close agreement with the qualitative and quantitative trends reported in the original work. At the same time, our experiments show that performance is sensitive to a small number of hyperparameter assumptions, particularly the optimized timestep and the feature level used for motion supervision, while other components admit broader operating ranges. We further evaluate a multi-timestep latent optimization variant and find that it does not improve spatial accuracy while substantially increasing computational cost.

We propose a rethinking of the rail abstraction by retaining its communication semantics, but realizing it using optical circuit switches. The key challenge is that optical switches support one-to-one connectivity at a time, limiting the fan-out of traffic in ML workloads using hybrid parallelisms. We overcome this through \\emph{parallelism-driven rail reconfiguration}, which exploits the non-overlapping communication phases of different parallelism dimensions. This time-multiplexes a single set of physical ports across circuit configurations tailored to each phase within a training iteration. We design and implement Opus, a control plane that orchestrates this in-job reconfiguration of photonic rails at parallelism phase boundaries, and evaluate it on a physical OCS testbed, the Perlmutter supercomputer, and in simulation at up to 2,048 GPUs.

To bridge the gap, we propose a Frankenstein-style analysis framework including: (i) functional localization via causal probing; (ii) update characterization via parameter comparison; and (iii) transferability test via model merging. Instead, RL induces a consistent inference-time shift primarily in mid-to-late layers, and these mid-to-late refinements are both transferable (via merging) and necessary (via freezing) for RL gains. Overall, our results suggest that RL's reliable contribution in visual reasoning is not a uniform enhancement of visual perception, but a systematic refinement of mid-to-late transformer computation that improves vision-to-reasoning alignment and reasoning performance, highlighting the limitations of benchmark-only evaluation for understanding multimodal reasoning improvements.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we identify spurious visual semantic correlations in existing generative ZSL worsened by scarce seen class samples and introduce two metrics to quantify spuriousness for seen and unseen classes. Furthermore, we point out a more critical bottleneck: existing unadaptive fully noised generators produce features disconnected from real test samples, which also leads to the spurious correlation. To enhance the visual-semantic correlations on both seen and unseen classes, we propose ZeroDiff++, a diffusion-based generative framework. In training, ZeroDiff++ uses (i) diffusion augmentation to produce diverse noised samples, (ii) supervised contrastive (SC) representations for instance level semantics, and (iii) multi view discriminators with Wasserstein mutual learning to assess generated features. At generation time, we introduce (iv) Diffusion-based Test time Adaptation (DiffTTA) to adapt the generator using pseudo label reconstruction, and (v) Diffusion-based Test time Generation (DiffGen) to trace the diffusion denoising path and produce partially synthesized features that connect real and generated data, and mitigates data scarcity further.

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are crucial in addressing these threats. Federated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving solution, but IoT heterogeneity and limited computational resources cause increased latency and reduced performance. This paper introduces a novel approach Cluster-based federated intrusion detection with lightweight networks for heterogeneous IoT designed to address these limitations. The proposed framework utilizes a hierarchical IoT architecture that encompasses edge, fog, and cloud layers. Intrusion detection clients operate at the fog layer, leveraging federated learning to enhance data privacy and distributed processing efficiency. To enhance efficiency, the method employs the lightweight MobileNet model alongside a hybrid loss function that integrates Gumbel-SoftMax and SoftMax, optimizing resource consumption while maintaining high detection accuracy. A key feature of this approach is clustering IoT devices based on hardware similarities, enabling more efficient model training and aggregation tailored to each cluster's computational capacity. This strategy not only simplifies the complexity of managing heterogeneous data and devices but also improves scalability and overall system performance. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, extensive experiments were conducted using the ToN-IoT and CICDDoS2019 datasets. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces end-to-end training time by 2.47x compared to traditional FL methods, achieves 2.16x lower testing latency, and maintains exceptionally high detection accuracy of 99.22% and 99.02% on the ToN-IoT and CICDDoS2019 datasets, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We can achieve expert-level performance in some specific domains via RLVR, such as coding or math. When a general multi-domain expert-level model is required, we need to carefully consider the collaboration of RLVR across different domains. The current state-of-the-art models mainly employ two different training paradigms for multi-domain RLVR: mixed multi-task RLVR and separate RLVR followed by model merging. However, most of the works did not provide a detailed comparison and analysis about these paradigms. To this end, we choose multiple commonly used high-level tasks (e.g., math, coding, science, and instruction following) as our target domains and design extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments using open-source datasets. We find the RLVR across domains exhibits few mutual interferences, and reasoning-intensive domains demonstrate mutually synergistic effects. Furthermore, we analyze the internal mechanisms of mutual gains from the perspectives of weight space geometry, model prediction behavior, and information constraints.

While PAC-Bayes bounds (probably approximately correct) typically give bounds for the generalization error that hold with high probability, MAC-Bayes bounds have a similar form but bound the expected generalization error instead. The family of bounds we propose can be understood as a generalization of an expectation version of known PAC-Bayes bounds. Compared to standard PAC-Bayes bounds, the new bounds contain divergence terms that only depend on subsets (or \\emph{blocks}) of the training data. The proposed MAC-Bayes bounds hold the promise of significantly improving upon the tightness of traditional PAC-Bayes and MAC-Bayes bounds. This is illustrated with a simple numerical example in which the original PAC-Bayes bound is vacuous regardless of the choice of prior, while the proposed family of bounds are finite for appropriate choices of the block size. We also explore the question whether high-probability versions of our MAC-Bayes bounds (i.e., PAC-Bayes bounds of a similar form) are possible. We answer this question in the negative with an example that shows that in general, it is not possible to establish a PAC-Bayes bound which (a) vanishes with a rate faster than $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\log n)$ whenever the proposed MAC-Bayes bound vanishes with rate $\\mathcal{O}(n^{-1/2})$ and (b) exhibits a logarithmic dependence on the permitted error probability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5757\u91c7\u6837MAC-Bayes\u754c\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u754c\u7ea6\u675f\u671f\u671b\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u800c\u975e\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ea\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5b50\u96c6\u7684\u6563\u5ea6\u9879\u53ef\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u4f20\u7edf\u754c\u7684\u7d27\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u4f8b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfPAC-Bayes\u754c\u5728\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u4e0b\u7ea6\u675f\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u8f83\u677e\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u65e0\u6548\uff1b\u800c\u671f\u671b\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u7684MAC-Bayes\u754c\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7d27\u81f4\u7684\u754c\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5f53\u6570\u636e\u5177\u6709\u5757\u7ed3\u6784\u65f6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53ea\u4f9d\u8d56\u6570\u636e\u5b50\u96c6\u7684\u6563\u5ea6\u9879\u6709\u671b\u6539\u8fdb\u754c\u7d27\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u65cf\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5757\u91c7\u6837MAC-Bayes\u754c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u754c\u53ef\u89c6\u4e3a\u5df2\u77e5PAC-Bayes\u754c\u5728\u671f\u671b\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7684\u63a8\u5e7f\uff1b\u65b0\u754c\u5305\u542b\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5757\uff08\u5b50\u96c6\uff09\u7684\u6563\u5ea6\u9879\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u5757\u5927\u5c0f\u53ef\u5f97\u5230\u6709\u9650\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u4f8b\u5b50\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfPAC-Bayes\u754c\u65e0\u8bba\u5982\u4f55\u9009\u62e9\u5148\u9a8c\u90fd\u662f\u65e0\u6548\u7684\uff0c\u800c\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5757\u91c7\u6837MAC-Bayes\u754c\u5728\u9002\u5f53\u5757\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0b\u662f\u6709\u9650\u7684\uff0c\u4e14\u53ef\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u754c\u7d27\u81f4\u6027\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8bc1\u660e\u5177\u6709\u7c7b\u4f3c\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u7248\u672cPAC-Bayes\u754c\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0eMAC-Bayes\u754c\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5757\u91c7\u6837MAC-Bayes\u754c\u5728\u7ea6\u675f\u671f\u671b\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfPAC-Bayes\u754c\uff0c\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7d27\u81f4\u7684\u754c\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u7248\u672c\uff1b\u8fd9\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u9002\u5408\u5177\u6709\u5757\u7ed3\u6784\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u5206\u6790\u3002"}}

Existing solutions include direct load control, operating envelopes, and price-based control through dynamic energy prices. Despite their effectiveness, these methods often rely on assumed prosumer behavioural patterns and overlook prosumers' desire to retain control over their devices. Additionally, current fixed or Time-of-Use (ToU) prices are based on spatial and temporal averages, having limited impact on network conditions and DER operation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a bilevel optimisation framework that explicitly models prosumer decision-making in the design of dynamic network prices. The upper level represents the distribution system operator (DSO), setting network prices under cost-recovery and network constraints, while the lower level models prosumers optimising DER operation in response. The proposed framework preserves customer prerogative, enhances DER flexibility, and offers actionable insights for network hosting capacity management and the evolution of network tariff structures under high DER penetration.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In contrast, the electrocardiogram (ECG) is ubiquitous and inexpensive, and provides rich information on cardiac electrical activity and rhythm, yet offers limited insight into underlying cardiac structure and mechanical function. To address this, we introduce a contrastive learning framework that improves the extraction of clinically relevant cardiac phenotypes from ECG by learning from paired ECG-CMR data. Our approach aligns ECG representations with 3D CMR volumes at end-diastole (ED) and end-systole (ES), with a dual-phase contrastive loss to anchor each ECG jointly with both cardiac phases in a shared latent space. Unlike prior methods limited to 2D CMR representations with or without a temporal component, our framework models 3D anatomy at both ED and ES phases as distinct latent representations, enabling flexible disentanglement of structural and functional cardiac properties. Using over 34,000 ECG-CMR pairs from the UK Biobank, we demonstrate improved extraction of image-derived phenotypes from ECG, particularly for functional parameters ($\\uparrow$ 9.2\\%), while improvements in clinical outcome prediction remained modest ($\\uparrow$ 0.7\\%).

However, standard training objectives only weakly encourage this decomposition, and existing monosemanticity metrics require pairwise comparisons across all dataset samples, making them inefficient during training and evaluation. We study a recent MonoScore metric and derive a single-pass algorithm that computes exactly the same quantity, but with a cost that grows linearly, rather than quadratically, with the number of dataset images. On OpenImagesV7, we achieve up to a 1200x speedup wall-clock speedup in evaluation and 159x during training, while adding only ~4% per-epoch overhead. This allows us to treat MonoScore as a training signal: we introduce the Monosemanticity Loss (MonoLoss), a plug-in objective that directly rewards semantically consistent activations for learning interpretable monosemantic representations. Across SAEs trained on CLIP, SigLIP2, and pretrained ViT features, using BatchTopK, TopK, and JumpReLU SAEs, MonoLoss increases MonoScore for most latents. MonoLoss also consistently improves class purity (the fraction of a latent's activating images belonging to its dominant class) across all encoder and SAE combinations, with the largest gain raising baseline purity from 0.152 to 0.723. Used as an auxiliary regularizer during ResNet-50 and CLIP-ViT-B/32 finetuning, MonoLoss yields up to 0.6\\% accuracy gains on ImageNet-1K and monosemantic activating patterns on standard benchmark datasets.

We argue that effective opioid policy evaluation requires three capabilities -- forecasting future outcomes under current policies, counterfactual reasoning about alternative past decisions, and optimization over candidate interventions -- and propose to unify them through world modeling. We introduce Policy4OOD, a knowledge-guided spatio-temporal world model that addresses three core challenges: what policies prescribe, where effects manifest, and when effects unfold.Policy4OOD jointly encodes policy knowledge graphs, state-level spatial dependencies, and socioeconomic time series into a policy-conditioned Transformer that forecasts future opioid outcomes.Once trained, the world model serves as a simulator: forecasting requires only a forward pass, counterfactual analysis substitutes alternative policy encodings in the historical sequence, and policy optimization employs Monte Carlo Tree Search over the learned simulator. To support this framework, we construct a state-level monthly dataset (2019--2024) integrating opioid mortality, socioeconomic indicators, and structured policy encodings. Experiments demonstrate that spatial dependencies and structured policy knowledge significantly improve forecasting accuracy, validating each architectural component and the potential of world modeling for data-driven public health decision support.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPolicy4OOD\u77e5\u8bc6\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u963f\u7247\u7c7b\u836f\u7269\u653f\u7b56\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u4e09\u9879\u80fd\u529b\uff1a\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u963f\u7247\u7c7b\u836f\u7269\u5371\u673a\u662f\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u653f\u7b56\u5e72\u9884\u8bc4\u4f30\u56f0\u96be\uff1a\u591a\u79cd\u653f\u7b56\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e00\u4e2a\u98ce\u9669\u8def\u5f84\u53ef\u80fd\u65e0\u610f\u4e2d\u653e\u5927\u53e6\u4e00\u4e2a\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5177\u5907\u9884\u6d4b\u5f53\u524d\u653f\u7b56\u4e0b\u672a\u6765\u7ed3\u679c\u3001\u5bf9\u8fc7\u53bb\u66ff\u4ee3\u51b3\u7b56\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u5019\u9009\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPolicy4OOD\u77e5\u8bc6\u5f15\u5bfc\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u7f16\u7801\u653f\u7b56\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u3001\u5dde\u7ea7\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5230\u653f\u7b56\u6761\u4ef6Transformer\u4e2d\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u963f\u7247\u7c7b\u836f\u7269\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u62df\u5668\uff1a\u9884\u6d4b\u53ea\u9700\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5206\u6790\u5728\u5386\u53f2\u5e8f\u5217\u4e2d\u66ff\u6362\u66ff\u4ee3\u653f\u7b56\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u653f\u7b56\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u6811\u641c\u7d22\u3002\u6784\u5efa2019-2024\u5e74\u5dde\u7ea7\u6708\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u963f\u7247\u7c7b\u836f\u7269\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u7ecf\u6d4e\u6307\u6807\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u653f\u7b56\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u653f\u7b56\u77e5\u8bc6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6bcf\u4e2a\u67b6\u6784\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Policy4OOD\u901a\u8fc7\u4e16\u754c\u5efa\u6a21\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u963f\u7247\u7c7b\u836f\u7269\u653f\u7b56\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u4e09\u9879\u5173\u952e\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u516c\u5171\u536b\u751f\u51b3\u7b56\u652f\u6301\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

McDiffuSE uses look-ahead simulations to evaluate partial completions before commitment, systematically exploring the combinatorial space of generation orders. Experiments show an average improvement of 3.2% over autoregressive baselines and 8.0% over baseline plan-and-infill, with notable gains of 19.5% on MBPP and 4.9% on MATH500. Our analysis reveals that while McDiffuSE predominantly follows sequential ordering, incorporating non-sequential generation is essential for maximising performance.

However, common Euclidean projections onto the safe set disregard long-term performance, while directly optimizing the action-value function within the safe set can be nonconvex and computationally prohibitive. This paper proposes a state-dependent, Hessian-guided projection for safety filtering that preserves convexity while improving performance. The key idea is to select a weighted projection matrix from the curvature of the action-value function, thereby biasing the correction toward action directions with higher value sensitivity. We establish (i) a uniform bound on the performance gap between the weighted projection and the safe value-optimal action, and (ii) a condition under which the weighted projection outperforms the Euclidean projection in long-term value. To support black-box controllers, we further present a data-driven construction of the weighted projection matrix via an iterative Q-function learning algorithm with quadratic feature blocks and regularization that enforces curvature dominance and bounded higher-order terms.

The agent acts greedily with respect to an estimate of the value plus what can be seen as a value bonus. The value bonus can be learned by estimating a value function on reward bonuses, propagating local uncertainties around rewards. However, this approach only increases the value bonus for an action retroactively, after seeing a higher reward bonus from that state and action. Such an approach does not encourage the agent to visit a state and action for the first time. In this work, we introduce an algorithm for exploration called Value Bonuses with Ensemble errors (VBE), that maintains an ensemble of random action-value functions (RQFs). VBE uses the errors in the estimation of these RQFs to design value bonuses that provide first-visit optimism and deep exploration. The key idea is to design the rewards for these RQFs in such a way that the value bonus can decrease to zero. We show that VBE outperforms Bootstrap DQN and two reward bonus approaches (RND and ACB) on several classic environments used to test exploration and provide demonstrative experiments that it can scale easily to more complex environments like Atari.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

An example is the control of a self-driving vehicle among pedestrians and human-controlled vehicles whose behavior may change based on factors such as traffic density, road visibility, and social norms. Therefore, the environment encountered during deployment rarely mirrors the environment and data encountered during training -- a phenomenon known as distribution shift -- which can undermine the safety of autonomous systems. Conformal prediction (CP) has recently been used along with data from the training environment to provide prediction regions that capture the behavior of the environment with a desired probability. When embedded within a model predictive controller (MPC), one can provide probabilistic safety guarantees, but only when the deployment and training environments coincide. Once a distribution shift occurs, these guarantees collapse. We propose a planning framework that is robust under distribution shifts by: (i) assuming that the underlying data distribution of the environment is parameterized by a nuisance parameter, i.e., an observable, interpretable quantity such as traffic density, (ii) training a conditional diffusion model that captures distribution shifts as a function of the nuisance parameter, (iii) observing the nuisance parameter online and generating cheap, synthetic data from the diffusion model for the observed nuisance parameter, and (iv) designing an MPC that embeds CP regions constructed from such synthetic data. Importantly, we account for discrepancies between the underlying data distribution and the diffusion model by using robust CP. Thus, the plans computed using robust CP enjoy probabilistic safety guarantees, in contrast with plans obtained from a single, static set of training data. We empirically demonstrate safety under diverse distribution shifts in the ORCA simulator.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5e94\u5bf9\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728MPC\u4e2d\u5d4c\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u7b26\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u57df\u6765\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6982\u7387\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u4f1a\u906d\u9047\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u73af\u5883\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5931\u6548\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u884c\u4eba\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4f1a\u56e0\u4ea4\u901a\u5bc6\u5ea6\u3001\u9053\u8def\u80fd\u89c1\u5ea6\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4f7f\u8bad\u7ec3\u73af\u5883\u4e0e\u90e8\u7f72\u73af\u5883\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "method": "1) \u5047\u8bbe\u73af\u5883\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u7531\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5982\u4ea4\u901a\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff09\u53c2\u6570\u5316\uff1b2) \u8bad\u7ec3\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6355\u6349\u5e72\u6270\u53c2\u6570\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff1b3) \u5728\u7ebf\u89c2\u6d4b\u5e72\u6270\u53c2\u6570\u5e76\u4ece\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff1b4) \u8bbe\u8ba1MPC\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u5d4c\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u7b26\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u533a\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u5728ORCA\u4eff\u771f\u5668\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u89c4\u5212\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u4e00\u9759\u6001\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u6982\u7387\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9c81\u68d2\u7b26\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u548cMPC\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3-\u90e8\u7f72\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

However, it has been shown that the cosine similarity between a single image and a single hand-crafted template is insufficient to measure the similarity for image-text pairs. Building on this, in this paper, we find that the AEs generated using cosine similarity may fail to fool CLIP when the similarity metric is replaced with semantically enriched alternatives, making the image encoder fine-tuned with these AEs less robust. To overcome this issue, we first propose a semantic-ensemble attack to generate semantic-aware AEs by minimizing the average similarity between the original image and an ensemble of refined textual descriptions. These descriptions are initially generated by a foundation model to capture core semantic features beyond hand-crafted templates and are then refined to reduce hallucinations. To this end, we propose Semantic-aware Adversarial Fine-Tuning (SAFT), which fine-tunes CLIP's image encoder with semantic-aware AEs. Extensive experiments show that SAFT outperforms current methods, achieving substantial improvements in zero-shot adversarial robustness across 16 datasets.

While Iterative Conditional Expectation (ICE) G-computation offers a principled approach, its recursive structure suffers from error propagation, corrupting the learned outcome regression models. We propose D3-Net, a framework that mitigates error propagation in ICE training and then applies a robust final correction. First, to interrupt error propagation during learning, we train the ICE sequence using Sequential Doubly Robust (SDR) pseudo-outcomes, which provide bias-corrected targets for each regression. Second, we employ a multi-task Transformer with a covariate simulator head for auxiliary supervision, regularizing representations against corruption by noisy pseudo-outcomes, and a target network to stabilize training dynamics. For the final estimate, we discard the SDR correction and instead use the uncorrected nuisance models to perform Longitudinal Targeted Minimum Loss-Based Estimation (LTMLE) on the original outcomes. This second-stage, targeted debiasing ensures robustness and optimal finite-sample properties.

The existing backup controller design schemes do not consider a real-time deadline for the course correction of a potentially unsafe system trajectory or constrain maximisation of the safe operating region as a synthesis criterion. This essentially implies an eventual safety guarantee over a small operating region.\n  This paper proposes a novel design method for backup safe controllers (BSCs) that ensure invariance across the largest possible region in the safe state space, along with a guarantee for timely recovery when the system states deviate from their usual behaviour. This is the first work to synthesise safe controllers that ensure maximal safety and timely recovery while aiming at minimal resource usage by switching between BSCs with different execution rates. An online safe controller activation policy is also proposed to switch between BSCs (and the primary optimal controller) to optimise processing bandwidth for control computation.

The production and quality of grapes are significantly impacted by grape diseases such as Bacterial Rot, Downy Mildew, and Powdery Mildew. Consequently, the sustainable management of a vineyard necessitates the early and precise identification of these diseases. Current automated methods, particularly those that are based on the YOLO framework, are often computationally costly and lack interpretability that makes them unsuitable for real-world scenarios. This study proposes grape leaf disease classification using Optimized DenseNet 121. Domain-specific preprocessing and extensive connectivity reveal disease-relevant characteristics, including veins, edges, and lesions. An extensive comparison with baseline CNN models, including ResNet18, VGG16, AlexNet, and SqueezeNet, demonstrates that the proposed model exhibits superior performance. It achieves an accuracy of 99.27%, an F1 score of 99.28%, a specificity of 99.71%, and a Kappa of 98.86%, with an inference time of 9 seconds. The cross-validation findings show a mean accuracy of 99.12%, indicating strength and generalizability across all classes.

However, current agents typically rely on fixed cognitive patterns: non-thinking models generate immediate responses, while thinking models engage in deep reasoning uniformly. This rigidity is inefficient for long-horizon tasks, where cognitive demands vary significantly from step to step, with some requiring strategic planning and others only routine execution. In this paper, we introduce CogRouter, a framework that trains agents to dynamically adapt cognitive depth at each step. Grounded in ACT-R theory, we design four hierarchical cognitive levels ranging from instinctive responses to strategic planning. Our two-stage training approach includes Cognition-aware Supervised Fine-tuning (CoSFT) to instill stable level-specific patterns, and Cognition-aware Policy Optimization (CoPO) for step-level credit assignment via confidence-aware advantage reweighting. The key insight is that appropriate cognitive depth should maximize the confidence of the resulting action. Experiments on ALFWorld and ScienceWorld demonstrate that CogRouter achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior efficiency.

Currently, research on link prediction for complex dynamic networks integrating temporal evolution, relational polarity and edge weight information remains significantly underexplored, failing to meet practical demands. For dynamic signed-weighted networks, this paper proposes a tripartite joint prediction framework for unified forecasting of links, signs and weights. First, the dynamic network is decomposed into temporal snapshots, and node semantic embeddings are generated via sign-aware weighted random walks. We then design multi-hop structural balance and temporal difference features to capture the structural characteristics and dynamic evolution laws of the network, respectively. The model adopts a dual-channel feature decoupling mechanism: node semantic embeddings are used for link existence prediction, while relational sign features are fed into a Transformer encoder to model temporal dependencies. Finally, prediction results are output synergistically through a multi-task unit. Simulation experiments demonstrate that, compared with baseline methods, the proposed framework achieves an average 2%-4% improvement in the performance of link existence and relational sign prediction, and a significant 40%-50% reduction in edge weight prediction error.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Segmentation models, in contrast, optimize pixel-accurate masks that may misalign with such bodies. We ask whether and when these models nonetheless acquire human-like bodies. Using a time-to-collision (TTC) behavioral paradigm, we introduce a comparison pipeline and alignment metric, then vary model training time, size, and effective capacity via pruning. Across all manipulations, alignment with human behavior follows an inverse U-shaped curve: small/briefly trained/pruned models under-segment into blobs; large/fully trained models over-segment with boundary wiggles; and an intermediate ideal body granularity'' best matches humans. This suggests human-like coarse bodies emerge from resource constraints rather than bespoke biases, and points to simple knobs - early checkpoints, modest architectures, light pruning - for eliciting physics-efficient representations.

We propose an alternative route based on two theoretically grounded and empirically testable signatures of deep Jacobians: depth-induced exponential scaling of ordered singular values and strong spectral separation. Adopting a fixed-gates view of piecewise-linear networks, where Jacobians reduce to products of masked linear maps within a single activation region, we prove the existence of Lyapunov exponents governing the top singular values at initialization, give closed-form expressions in a tractable masked model, and quantify finite-depth corrections. We further show that sufficiently strong separation forces singular-vector alignment in matrix products, yielding an approximately shared singular basis for intermediate Jacobians. Together, these results motivate an approximation regime in which singular-value dynamics become effectively decoupled, mirroring classical balanced deep-linear analyses without requiring balancing. Experiments in fixed-gates settings validate the predicted scaling, alignment, and resulting dynamics, supporting a mechanistic account of emergent low-rank Jacobian structure as a driver of implicit bias.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Rather than implicitly approximating the Gramians via numerical quadrature, the proposed approach approximates them implicitly through projection. This enables multiple members of the balanced truncation family to be implemented non-intrusively using practically measurable data, without requiring spectral factorizations. Using this projection-based framework, data-driven implementations are developed for standard balanced truncation, frequency-limited balanced truncation, time-limited balanced truncation, self-weighted balanced truncation, LQG balanced truncation, H-infinity balanced truncation, positive-real balanced truncation, bounded-real balanced truncation, and stochastic balanced truncation. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed non-intrusive implementations achieve performance comparable to their intrusive counterparts and accurately capture the dominant Hankel singular values.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

One particular application of this technique is slice-level content navigation, where the goal is to localize specific 2D slices within a 3D volume or determine the anatomical coverage of a 3D scan based on its 2D slices. This serves as an important preprocessing step for various diagnostic tasks, as well as for automatic registration and segmentation pipelines. Our approach builds sequence correspondence by training a network to learn how to insert a slice from one sequence into the appropriate position in another. This is achieved by encoding contextual representations of each slice and modeling the insertion process using a slice-to-slice attention mechanism. We apply this method to localize manually labeled key slices in body CT scans and compare its performance to the current state-of-the-art alternative known as body part regression, which predicts anatomical position scores for individual slices. Unlike body part regression, which treats each slice independently, our method leverages contextual information from the entire sequence. Experimental results show that the insertion network reduces slice localization errors in supervised settings from 8.4 mm to 5.4 mm, demonstrating a substantial improvement in accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Using high-frequency data from 2021 to 2024, this paper evaluates this mechanism and yields three primary findings. First, a structural trade-off exists within the VC framework: while VC quantity (VCQ) suppresses average prices, it paradoxically exacerbates instability via liquidity squeezes. Conversely, VC price (VCP) functions as a tail-risk anchor, dominating at extreme quantiles where VCQ efficacy wanes. Second, a structural break around the 2023 reform reveals a fundamental re-mapping of price dynamics; the previously positive pass-through from offer ratios to clearing prices was largely neutralized post-reform. Furthermore, diagnostics near the TPC threshold show no systematic evidence of strategic bid shading, confirming the TPC's operational integrity. Third, the dual-defense mechanism exhibits a critical synergy that resolves the volatility trade-off. The TPC reverses the volatility penalty of high VCQ, shifting the elasticity of conditional volatility from a destabilizing 0.636 to a stabilizing -0.213. This synergy enables the framework to enhance tail-risk control while eliminating liquidity-related stability costs.

To systematically characterize this limitation, we introduce a radiology-specific diagnostic benchmark that evaluates polarity sensitivity under controlled clinical conditions, revealing that common medical VLMs consistently confuse negated and non-negated findings. To enable learning beyond simple condition absence, we further construct a contextual clinical negation dataset that encodes structured claims and supports attribute-level negations involving location and severity. Building on these resources, we propose Negation-Aware Selective Training (NAST), an interpretability-guided adaptation method that uses causal tracing effects (CTEs) to modulate layer-wise gradient updates during fine-tuning. Rather than applying uniform learning rates, NAST scales each layer's update according to its causal contribution to negation processing, transforming mechanistic interpretability signals into a principled optimization rule. Experiments demonstrate improved discrimination of affirmative and negated clinical statements without degrading general vision-language alignment, highlighting the value of causal interpretability for targeted model adaptation in safety-critical medical settings.

These environments can include factors such as sensor drift, changing user behavior, device aging, and adversarial dynamics. Contrastive continual learning (CCL) combines contrastive representation learning with incremental adaptation, enabling robust feature reuse across tasks and domains. However, the geometric nature of contrastive objectives, when paired with replay-based rehearsal and stability-preserving regularization, introduces new security vulnerabilities. Notably, backdoor attacks can exploit embedding alignment and replay reinforcement, enabling the implantation of persistent malicious behaviors that endure through updates and deployment cycles. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of backdoor attacks on CCL within IoT systems. We formalize the objectives of embedding-level attacks, examine persistence mechanisms unique to IoT deployments, and develop a layered taxonomy tailored to IoT. Additionally, we compare vulnerabilities across various learning paradigms and evaluate defense strategies under IoT constraints, including limited memory, edge computing, and federated aggregation. Our findings indicate that while CCL is effective for enhancing adaptive IoT intelligence, it may also elevate long-lived representation-level threats if not adequately secured.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce X-SYS, a reference architecture for interactive explanation systems, that guides (X)AI researchers, developers and practitioners in connecting interactive explanation user interfaces (XUI) with system capabilities. X-SYS organizes around four quality attributes named STAR (scalability, traceability, responsiveness, and adaptability), and specifies a five-component decomposition (XUI Services, Explanation Services, Model Services, Data Services, Orchestration and Governance). It maps interaction patterns to system capabilities to decouple user interface evolution from backend computation. We implement X-SYS through SemanticLens, a system for semantic search and activation steering in vision-language models.

While massive Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems enable millimeter-level accuracy by leveraging rich Channel State Information (CSI), most existing solutions are optimized for static environments, where users or devices remain fixed during data collection and inference. Real-world applications, however, often require real-time localization in changing environments, where rapid movement, unpredictable blockages, and dynamic channel conditions pose significant challenges. To address these challenges, we introduce two data augmentation techniques designed to resemble blocked antennas, enhancing the generalizability of localization models to dynamic scenarios. Additionally, we enhance an existing Deep Learning (DL) model by incorporating attention modules, improving its ability to focus on relevant channel features and antennas. We train our model on data from a static scenario, augmented with the proposed techniques, and evaluate it on a dataset collected in changing scenarios. We investigate the performance enhancements achieved by the data augmentation techniques and the Attention modules, and observe a localization accuracy improvement from a mean error of 286 mm, when trained without Attention and without data augmentations, to 66 mm, when trained with Attention and data augmentation. This shows that high localization accuracy can be maintained in changing environments, even without training data from those scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

These differences make precise image matching (co-registration) of these two types of images difficult. In this paper, we propose a new approach to image matching of optical and SAR images, which is based on transforming the images to a new modality. The new image modality is common to both optical and SAR images and satisfies the following conditions. First, the transformed images must have an equal pre-defined number of channels. Second, the transformed and co-registered images must be as similar as possible. Third, the transformed images must be non-degenerate, meaning they must preserve the significant features of the original images. To further match images transformed to this shared modality, we train the RoMa image matching model, which is one of the leading solutions for matching of regular digital photographs. We evaluated the proposed approach on the publicly available MultiSenGE dataset containing both optical and SAR images.

This gap is primarily due to (i) the absence of high-quality, privacy-sensitive data that capture personalized user-LLM interactions at scale, and (ii) the lack of robust reward signals for individual preferences. To overcome existing data limitations, we introduce a high-fidelity synthetic data generation framework called PersonaGym. Unlike prior work that treats personalization as static persona-preference pairs, PersonaGym models a dynamic preference process via an agentic LLM system to simulate realistic preference behaviors and semantic-aware noise in order to generate personalized multi-turn interaction trajectories. Using PersonaGym, we release PersonaAtlas, a large-scale, high-quality, and diverse synthetic dataset of high-fidelity multi-turn personalized interaction trajectories that closely mirror real-world preference expression and noise patterns. We further propose Personalized Prompt Optimization (PPOpt), a scalable and model-agnostic framework that optimizes user prompts based on interaction histories without modifying the deployed LLM. PPOpt adopts a reason-then-optimize paradigm that infers an explicit user profile and conditions prompt rewriting on the user profile to avoid reward hacking. Our training procedure for PPOpt integrates a cold-start supervised prior with outcome-driven multi-objective reinforcement learning.

To address this, we propose WebClipper, a framework that compresses web agent trajectories via graph-based pruning. Concretely, we model the agent's search process as a state graph and cast trajectory optimization as a minimum-necessary Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) mining problem, yielding pruned trajectories that preserve essential reasoning while eliminating redundant steps. Continued training on these refined trajectories enables the agent to evolve toward more efficient search patterns and reduces tool-call rounds by about 20% while improving accuracy.

In both settings, the objective is to identify a set of local models such that the controller synthesized for these local models will satisfy global stability and performance requirements for the entire system. Here, local models correspond to evaluations of the LPV or uncertain plant at fixed values of the scheduling signal or realizations of the uncertainty set, respectively. Then, Bayesian optimization is employed to discover the most informative points that govern the closed-loop performance of the designed LPV or robust controller for the complete system until no significant further performance increase or a user specified limit is reached. Furthermore, when local model evaluations are computationally demanding or difficult to obtain, the proposed method is capable to minimize the number of evaluations and adjust the overall computational cost to the available budget. Lastly, the capabilities of the proposed method in automatically obtaining a sufficiently informative grid set are demonstrated on three case-studies: a robust controller design for an unbalanced disk, a multi-objective robust attitude controller design for a satellite with uncertain parameters and two flexible rotating solar arrays, and an LPV controller design for a robotic arm.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, despite the continued rise in design complexity, advances in AMS automation remain limited. This reflects the central challenge in developing a generalized optimization method applicable across diverse circuit design spaces, many of which are distinct, constrained, and non-differentiable. To address this, our work casts circuit design as a graph generation problem and introduces a novel method of AMS synthesis driven by deep reinforcement learning (AstRL). Based on a policy-gradient approach, AstRL generates circuits directly optimized for user-specified targets within a simulator-embedded environment that provides ground-truth feedback during training. Through behavioral-cloning and discriminator-based similarity rewards, our method demonstrates, for the first time, an expert-aligned paradigm for generalized circuit generation validated in simulation. Importantly, the proposed approach operates at the level of individual transistors, enabling highly expressive, fine-grained topology generation.

However, existing benchmarks for multimodal browsing remain limited in task complexity, evidence accessibility, and evaluation granularity, hindering comprehensive and reproducible assessments of deep search capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce BrowseComp-$V^3$, a novel benchmark consisting of 300 carefully curated and challenging questions spanning diverse domains. The benchmark emphasizes deep, multi-level, and cross-modal multi-hop reasoning, where critical evidence is interleaved across textual and visual modalities within and across web pages. All supporting evidence is strictly required to be publicly searchable, ensuring fairness and reproducibility. Beyond final-answer accuracy, we incorporate an expert-validated, subgoal-driven process evaluation mechanism that enables fine-grained analysis of intermediate reasoning behaviors and systematic characterization of capability boundaries. In addition, we propose OmniSeeker, a unified multimodal browsing agent framework integrating diverse web search and visual perception tools. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models achieve only 36% accuracy on our benchmark, revealing critical bottlenecks in multimodal information integration and fine-grained perception.

Recent encoder-based methods for artificial neural network state-space (ANN-SS) models have shown state-of-the-art performance with improved computational efficiency, where the encoder is used to estimate the initial state allowing for batch optimisation methods. To address the lack of interpretability of these black-box ANN models, model augmentation approaches can be used. These combine prior available baseline models with the ANN learning components, resulting in faster convergence and more interpretable models. The combination of the encoder-based method with model augmentation has shown potential. Thus far, however, the encoder has still been treated as a black-box function in the overall estimation process, while additional information in the form of the baseline model is available to predict the model state from past input-output data. In this paper, we propose novel encoder initialisation approaches based on the available baseline model, resulting in improved noise robustness and faster convergence compared to black-box initialisation.

We study this soft contamination of training data by semantic duplicates. Among other experiments, we embed the Olmo3 training corpus and find that: 1) contamination remains widespread, e.g. we find semantic duplicates for 78% of CodeForces and exact duplicates for 50% of ZebraLogic problems; 2) including semantic duplicates of benchmark data in training does improve benchmark performance; and 3) when finetuning on duplicates of benchmark datapoints, performance also improves on truly-held-out datapoints from the same benchmark.

This approach limits the reflection to a single hemisphere, and the beam-scanning range is relatively small. In this work, a novel three-dimensional (3D) RIS concept is proposed, where beam-scanning can be realized not only through reflection from the illuminated surface but also through controlled transmission toward adjacent surfaces, enabling near blind-spot-free coverage in the full 3D spatial domain. A cube-based 3D-RIS design operating at millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) frequencies and consisting of six interconnected RIS surfaces is presented. Each surface integrates reconfigurable receiving and reflecting arrays with orthogonal polarizations to ensure intrinsic EM isolation, while a reconfigurable feeding network supports dynamic operation. A subarray-based synthesis approach with binary amplitude gating and predefined phase offsets is developed through a unified theoretical model. This model, validated through full-wave simulations, enables efficient beam switching through a shared aperture. Based on this framework, an 8 x 12 element surface comprising six 4 x 4 subarrays is designed, with each surface covering an angular range from -30 deg to +30 deg. The experimental prototype has been characterized in the 24 to 30 GHz band, and the results demonstrate a gain enhancement of 14.7 dB for reflection, while 14.1 dB is achieved for transmission to the neighboring surface. Finally, wireless communication trials using the Pluto software-defined radio platform combined with frequency up/down converters confirm improved constellation quality and a 6-7 dB improvement in error vector magnitude (EVM) for both reflection and neighboring surface transmission scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Low-rank factorization offers a promising route to reduce training and inference costs, but the community lacks a stable recipe for training models from scratch using exclusively low-rank weights while matching the performance of the dense model. We demonstrate that Large Language Models (LLMs) can be trained from scratch using exclusively low-rank factorized weights for all non-embedding matrices without auxiliary \"full-rank\" guidance required by prior methods. While native low-rank training often suffers from instability and loss spikes, we identify uncontrolled growth in the spectral norm (largest singular value) of the weight matrix update as the dominant factor. To address this, we introduce Spectron: Spectral renormalization with orthogonalization, which dynamically bounds the resultant weight updates based on the current spectral norms of the factors.

We identify a critical decoupling failure in current research: the lack of distinction between appearance-based shifts, such as weather and lighting, and structural scene changes. This leaves a fundamental question unanswered: Is the planner failing because of complex road geometry, or simply because it is raining? To resolve this, we establish navdream, a high-fidelity robustness benchmark leveraging generative pixel-aligned style transfer. By creating a visual stress test with negligible geometric deviation, we isolate the impact of appearance on driving performance. Our evaluation reveals that existing planning algorithms often show significant degradation under OOD appearance conditions, even when the underlying scene structure remains consistent. To bridge this gap, we propose a universal perception interface leveraging a frozen visual foundation model (DINOv3). By extracting appearance-invariant features as a stable interface for the planner, we achieve exceptional zero-shot generalization across diverse planning paradigms, including regression-based, diffusion-based, and scoring-based models. Our plug-and-play solution maintains consistent performance across extreme appearance shifts without requiring further fine-tuning.

We examine the trade-offs between the power of computation and observation within this scenario, employing the Ising model as a paradigmatic example. We demonstrate that it is feasible to reconstruct the model parameters for a model with $\\ell_1$ width $\u03b3$ by observing statistics up to an order of $O(\u03b3)$.

Motivated by the limitations of classical optimal control under uncertainty and the need for interpretable decision making in safety critical aviation systems, we design a three stage Takagi Sugeno Kang fuzzy layer that modulates constraint radii, urgency levels, and activation decisions based on regulatory separation minima and airworthiness guidelines from FAA and EASA. These fuzzy-derived clearances are then incorporated as soft constraints into an optimal control problem solved using the FALCON toolbox and IPOPT. The framework aims to reduce unnecessary recomputations by selectively activating obstacle avoidance updates while maintaining compliance with aviation procedures. A proof of concept implementation using a simplified aircraft model demonstrates that the approach can generate optimal trajectories with computation times of 2,3 seconds per iteration in a single threaded MATLAB environment, suggesting feasibility for near real time applications. However, our experiments revealed a critical software incompatibility in the latest versions of FALCON and IPOPT, in which the Lagrangian penalty term remained identically zero, preventing proper constraint enforcement. This behavior was consistent across scenarios and indicates a solver toolbox regression rather than a modeling flaw.

To leverage conventional image processing pipelines, events are typically binned into frames. However, binning functions are discontinuous, which truncates gradients at the frame level and forces most event-based algorithms to rely solely on frame-based features. Attempts to directly learn from raw events avoid this restriction but instead suffer from biased gradient estimation due to the discontinuities of the binning operation, ultimately limiting their learning efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework for unbiased gradient estimation of arbitrary binning functions by synthesizing weak derivatives during backpropagation while keeping the forward output unchanged. The key idea is to exploit integration by parts: lifting the target functions to functionals yields an integral form of the derivative of the binning function during backpropagation, where the cotangent function naturally arises. By reconstructing this cotangent function from the sampled cotangent vector, we compute weak derivatives that provably match long-range finite differences of both smooth and non-smooth targets. Experimentally, our method improves simple optimization-based egomotion estimation with 3.2\\% lower RMS error and 1.57$\\times$ faster convergence. On complex downstream tasks, we achieve 9.4\\% lower EPE in self-supervised optical flow, and 5.1\\% lower RMS error in SLAM, demonstrating broad benefits for event-based visual perception.

It can dynamically adapt to various predefined bit-widths by cascading different low-rank adapters, and supports real-time switching between uniform quantization and mixed precision quantization without repeated optimization. To enhance accuracy and robustness, we introduce Multi-Bit Token Merging (MB-ToMe) to dynamically fuse token features across different bit-widths, improving robustness during bit-width switching. Additionally, we propose Multi-Bit Cascaded Low-Rank adapters (MB-CLoRA) to strengthen correlations between bit-width groups, further improve the overall performance of QuEPT. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QuEPT achieves comparable or better performance to existing state-of-the-art post-training quantization methods.Our code is available at https://github.com/xuke225/QuEPT", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We propose a regularized meta-learning framework that addresses these challenges through a four-stage pipeline combining redundancy-aware projection, statistical meta-feature augmentation, and cross-validated regularized meta-models (Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet). Our multi-metric de-duplication strategy removes near-collinear predictors using correlation and MSE thresholds ($\u03c4_{\\text{corr}}=0.95$), reducing the effective condition number of the meta-design matrix while preserving predictive diversity. Engineered ensemble statistics and interaction terms recover higher-order structure unavailable to raw prediction columns. A final inverse-RMSE blending stage mitigates regularizer-selection variance. On the Playground Series S6E1 benchmark (100K samples, 72 base models), the proposed framework achieves an out-of-fold RMSE of 8.582, improving over simple averaging (8.894) and conventional Ridge stacking (8.627), while matching greedy hill climbing (8.603) with substantially lower runtime (4 times faster). Conditioning analysis shows a 53.7\\% reduction in effective matrix condition number after redundancy projection. Comprehensive ablations demonstrate consistent contributions from de-duplication, statistical meta-features, and meta-ensemble blending. These results position regularized meta-learning as a stable and deployment-efficient stacking strategy for high-dimensional ensemble systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Prior pruning methods operate either before the LLM, limiting generality due to diverse encoder-projector designs or within the LLM using heuristics that are incompatible with FlashAttention. We take a different approach: rather than identifying unimportant tokens, we treat the LLM itself as the optimal guide for compression. Observing that deeper layers naturally transmit vision-to-text information, we introduce Attention-Driven Self-Compression (ADSC), a simple, broadly applicable method that progressively reduces vision tokens using only the LLM's attention mechanism. Our method applies uniform token downsampling at selected layers, forming bottlenecks that encourage the model to reorganize and compress information into the remaining tokens. It requires no score computation, auxiliary modules, or attention modification, and remains fully compatible with FlashAttention. Applied to LLaVA-1.5, ADSC reduces FLOPs by 53.7% and peak KV-cache memory by 56.7%, while preserving 98.2% of the original model performance.

We instead reframe RNA design as conditional sequence generation and introduce a reusable neural approximator, instantiated as an autoregressive language model (LM), that maps target structures directly to sequences. We first train our model in a supervised setting on random-induced structure-sequence pairs, and then use reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize end-to-end metrics.

However, their iterative sampling process, which gradually morphs random noise into coherent images, introduces significant latency that limits their applicability. While recent few-step diffusion models reduce the number of sampling steps to as few as one to four steps, they often compromise image quality and prompt alignment, especially in one-step generation. Additionally, these models require computationally expensive training procedures. To address these limitations, we propose ImageRAGTurbo, a novel approach to efficiently finetune few-step diffusion models via retrieval augmentation. Given a text prompt, we retrieve relevant text-image pairs from a database and use them to condition the generation process. We argue that such retrieved examples provide rich contextual information to the UNet denoiser that helps reduce the number of denoising steps without compromising image quality. Indeed, our initial investigations show that using the retrieved content to edit the denoiser's latent space ($\\mathcal{H}$-space) without additional finetuning already improves prompt fidelity. To further improve the quality of the generated images, we augment the UNet denoiser with a trainable adapter in the $\\mathcal{H}$-space, which efficiently blends the retrieved content with the target prompt using a cross-attention mechanism.

However, in the literature cloudless analysis is often performed where cloudy images are excluded from machine learning datasets and methods. Such an approach cannot be applied to time sensitive applications, e.g., during natural disasters. A possible solution is to apply cloud removal as a preprocessing step to ensure that cloudfree solutions are not failing under such conditions. But cloud removal methods are still actively researched and suffer from drawbacks, such as generated visual artifacts. Therefore, it is desirable to develop cloud robust methods that are less affected by cloudy weather. Cloud robust methods can be achieved by combining optical data with radar, a modality unaffected by clouds. While many datasets for machine learning combine optical and radar data, most researchers exclude cloudy images. We identify this exclusion from machine learning training and evaluation as a limitation that reduces applicability to cloudy scenarios. To investigate this, we assembled a dataset, named CloudyBigEarthNet (CBEN), of paired optical and radar images with cloud occlusion for training and evaluation. Using average precision (AP) as the evaluation metric, we show that state-of-the-art methods trained on combined clear-sky optical and radar imagery suffer performance drops of 23-33 percentage points when evaluated on cloudy images. We then adapt these methods to cloudy optical data during training, achieving relative improvement of 17.2-28.7 percentage points on cloudy test cases compared with the original approaches.

While RL-tuned VLMs improve on visual reasoning benchmarks, they remain vulnerable to weak visual grounding, hallucinations, and over-reliance on textual cues. We show that simple, controlled textual perturbations--misleading captions or incorrect chain-of-thought (CoT) traces--cause substantial drops in robustness and confidence, and that these effects are more pronounced when CoT consistency is taken into account across open-source multimodal reasoning models. Entropy-based metrics further show that these perturbations reshape model uncertainty and probability mass on the correct option, exposing model-specific trends in miscalibration. To better understand these vulnerabilities, we further analyze RL fine-tuning dynamics and uncover an accuracy-faithfulness trade-off: fine-tuning raises benchmark accuracy, but can simultaneously erode the reliability of the accompanying CoT and its robustness to contextual shifts. Although adversarial augmentation improves robustness, it does not by itself prevent faithfulness drift. Incorporating a faithfulness-aware reward can restore alignment between answers and reasoning, but when paired with augmentation, training risks collapsing onto shortcut strategies and robustness remains elusive. Together, these findings highlight the limitations of accuracy-only evaluations and motivate training and assessment protocols that jointly emphasize correctness, robustness, and the faithfulness of visually grounded reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Project page: https://vvsjeon.github.io/MPD/", "summary": "Recent progress in image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models has significantly advanced the field of generative inbetweening, which aims to generate semantically plausible frames between two keyframes. In particular, inference-time sampling strategies, which leverage the generative priors of large-scale pre-trained I2V models without additional training, have become increasingly popular. However, existing inference-time sampling, either fusing forward and backward paths in parallel or alternating them sequentially, often suffers from temporal discontinuities and undesirable visual artifacts due to the misalignment between the two generated paths. This is because each path follows the motion prior induced by its own conditioning frame. In this work, we propose Motion Prior Distillation (MPD), a simple yet effective inference-time distillation technique that suppresses bidirectional mismatch by distilling the motion residual of the forward path into the backward path. Our method can deliberately avoid denoising the end-conditioned path which causes the ambiguity of the path, and yield more temporally coherent inbetweening results with the forward motion prior. We not only perform quantitative evaluations on standard benchmarks, but also conduct extensive user studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in practical scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, the field currently lacks a standardized evaluation protocol, forcing researchers to rely on bespoke, isolated, and often simplistic environments. This fragmentation makes it difficult to assess the robustness, generalization, and failure modes of emerging methods. To address this gap, we propose a comprehensive benchmark suite for MFGs (Bench-MFG), focusing on the discrete-time, discrete-space, stationary setting for the sake of clarity. We introduce a taxonomy of problem classes, ranging from no-interaction and monotone games to potential and dynamics-coupled games, and provide prototypical environments for each. Furthermore, we propose MF-Garnets, a method for generating random MFG instances to facilitate rigorous statistical testing. We benchmark a variety of learning algorithms across these environments, including a novel black-box approach (MF-PSO) for exploitability minimization.

Prior work trains MCI encoders but typically evaluates them via full fine-tuning, leaving probing with frozen pre-trained encoders comparatively underexplored. Existing studies that perform probing largely focus on improving representations, rather than how to best leverage fixed representations for downstream tasks. Although the latter problem has been studied in other domains, directly transferring those strategies to MCI yields weak results, even worse than training from scratch. We therefore propose Channel-Aware Probing (CAP), which exploits the intrinsic inter-channel diversity in MCI datasets by controlling feature flow at both the encoder and probe levels. CAP uses Independent Feature Encoding (IFE) to encode each channel separately, and Decoupled Pooling (DCP) to pool within channels before aggregating across channels. Across three MCI benchmarks, CAP consistently improves probing performance over the default probing protocol, matches fine-tuning from scratch, and largely reduces the gap to full fine-tuning from the same MCI pre-trained checkpoints.

To address this challenge, we present a novel model-based multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that unifies joint state-action representation learning with imaginative roll-outs. We design a world model trained with variational auto-encoders and augment the model using the state-action learned embedding (SALE). SALE is injected into both the imagination module that forecasts plausible future roll-outs and the joint agent network whose individual action values are combined through a mixing network to estimate the joint action-value function. By coupling imagined trajectories with SALE-based action values, the agents acquire a richer understanding of how their choices influence collective outcomes, leading to improved long-term planning and optimization under limited real-environment interactions. Empirical studies on well-established multi-agent benchmarks, including StarCraft II Micro-Management, Multi-Agent MuJoCo, and Level-Based Foraging challenges, demonstrate consistent gains of our method over baseline algorithms and highlight the effectiveness of joint state-action learned embeddings within a multi-agent model-based paradigm.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While longer reasoning traces can improve answer quality and unlock abilities such as self-correction, they also incur high inference costs and often introduce redundant steps, known as overthinking. Recent research seeks to develop efficient reasoning strategies that balance reasoning length and accuracy, either through length-aware reward design or prompt-based calibration. However, these heuristic-based approaches may suffer from severe accuracy drop and be very sensitive to hyperparameters. To address these problems, we introduce CRT (Constraint-Rectified Training), a principled post-training framework based on reference-guarded constrained optimization, yielding a more stable and interpretable formulation for efficient reasoning. CRT alternates between minimizing reasoning length and rectifying accuracy only when performance falls below the reference, enabling stable and effective pruning of redundant reasoning. We further extend CRT with a two-stage training scheme that first discovers the shortest reliable reasoning patterns and then refines accuracy under a learnt length budget, preventing the re-emergence of verbose CoT. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that this framework consistently reduces token usage while maintaining answer quality at a robust and reliable level. Further analysis reveals that CRT improves reasoning efficiency not only by shortening responses but also by reducing internal language redundancy, leading to a new evaluation metric. Moreover, CRT-based training naturally yields a sequence of intermediate checkpoints that span a spectrum of explanation lengths while preserving correctness, enabling fine-grained control over reasoning verbosity without retraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CRT\uff08\u7ea6\u675f\u4fee\u6b63\u8bad\u7ec3\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u6765\u4fee\u526a\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5197\u4f59\u6b65\u9aa4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0b\u964d\u548c\u5bf9\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u654f\u611f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "CRT\u91c7\u7528\u53c2\u8003\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ea4\u66ff\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u957f\u5ea6\u5e76\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4f4e\u4e8e\u53c2\u8003\u65f6\u4fee\u6b63\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\uff1a\u5148\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u77ed\u53ef\u9760\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u957f\u5ea6\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u4f18\u5316\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11token\u4f7f\u7528\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7b54\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793aCRT\u4e0d\u4ec5\u7f29\u77ed\u54cd\u5e94\u957f\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd8\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5185\u90e8\u8bed\u8a00\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5e76\u81ea\u7136\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u4fdd\u6301\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "CRT\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u63a8\u7406\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Traditional Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) methods rely on linear interaction histories, which struggle to handle long-context tasks, especially those involving information-sparse yet token-heavy visual data in iterative reasoning scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce VimRAG, a framework tailored for multimodal Retrieval-augmented Reasoning across text, images, and videos. Inspired by our systematic study, we model the reasoning process as a dynamic directed acyclic graph that structures the agent states and retrieved multimodal evidence. Building upon this structured memory, we introduce a Graph-Modulated Visual Memory Encoding mechanism, with which the significance of memory nodes is evaluated via their topological position, allowing the model to dynamically allocate high-resolution tokens to pivotal evidence while compressing or discarding trivial clues. To implement this paradigm, we propose a Graph-Guided Policy Optimization strategy. This strategy disentangles step-wise validity from trajectory-level rewards by pruning memory nodes associated with redundant actions, thereby facilitating fine-grained credit assignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VimRAG consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance on diverse multimodal RAG benchmarks.

In particular, exponential family distributions offer a unified and analytically tractable modeling paradigm that encompasses many commonly used distributions. In this paper, we investigate analytic results for two important members of the exponential family within the HDP framework: the Poisson distribution and the normal distribution. We derive explicit closed-form expressions for the corresponding Gamma-Poisson and Normal-Gamma-Normal conjugate pairs under the hierarchical Dirichlet process construction. Detailed derivations and proofs are provided to clarify the underlying mathematical structure and to demonstrate how conjugacy can be systematically exploited in hierarchical nonparametric models.

Depending on the input, they may over-rely on linguistic priors relative to visual evidence, or conversely over-attend to visually salient but facts in textual contexts. Prior work has applied a uniform steering intensity to adjust the modality preference of MLLMs. However, strong steering can impair standard inference and increase error rates, whereas weak steering is often ineffective. In addition, because steering sensitivity varies substantially across multimodal instances, a single global strength is difficult to calibrate. To address this limitation with minimal disruption to inference, we introduce an instance-aware diagnostic metric that quantifies each modality's information contribution and reveals sample-specific susceptibility to steering. Building on these insights, we propose a scaling strategy that reduces steering for sensitive samples and a learnable module that infers scaling patterns, enabling instance-aware control of modality preference. Experimental results show that our instance-aware steering outperforms conventional steering in modulating modality preference, achieving effective adjustment while keeping generation error rates low.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5b9e\u4f8b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u597d\u8c03\u6574\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8d21\u732e\u5e76\u63a8\u65ad\u6837\u672c\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8c03\u6574\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u597d\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u597d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8c03\u6574\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8c03\u6574\u4e0d\u8db3\u6216\u5f71\u54cd\u6807\u51c6\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u540c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5bf9\u8c03\u6574\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u5f88\u5927\uff0c\u5355\u4e00\u5168\u5c40\u5f3a\u5ea6\u96be\u4ee5\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5b9e\u4f8b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u6307\u6807\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6837\u672c\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8c03\u6574\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u63d0\u51fa\u964d\u4f4e\u654f\u611f\u6837\u672c\u8c03\u6574\u5f3a\u5ea6\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u5757\u63a8\u65ad\u7f29\u653e\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4f8b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u597d\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u611f\u77e5\u8c03\u6574\u5728\u8c03\u8282\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u597d\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8c03\u6574\u504f\u597d\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u751f\u6210\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5b9e\u4f8b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8c03\u6574\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5730\u63a7\u5236\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u8c03\u6574\u5f3a\u5ea6\u96be\u4ee5\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Yet most prior work targets whole brain age (WBA), a coarse paradigm that struggles to support tasks such as disease characterization and research on development and aging patterns, because relevant changes are typically region-selective rather than brain-wide. Therefore, robust regional brain age (ReBA) estimation is critical, yet a widely generalizable model has yet to be established. In this paper, we propose the Regional Brain Age Prediction Network (ReBA-Pred-Net), a Teacher-Student framework designed for fine-grained brain age estimation. The Teacher produces soft ReBA to guide the Student to yield reliable ReBA estimates with a clinical-prior consistency constraint (regions within the same function should change similarly). For rigorous evaluation, we introduce two indirect metrics: Healthy Control Similarity (HCS), which assesses statistical consistency by testing whether regional brain-age-gap (ReBA minus chronological age) distributions align between training and unseen HC; and Neuro Disease Correlation (NDC), which assesses factual consistency by checking whether clinically confirmed patients show elevated brain-age-gap in disease-associated regions. Experiments across multiple backbones demonstrate the statistical and factual validity of our method.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

As most studies consider synthetic data, it is not clear whether training data mismatch (``domain shift'') or forward model mismatch complicate their successful application to experimental data. We measured CT data from a physical phantom resembling the synthetic Shepp-Logan phantom and trained diffusion priors on synthetic image data sets with different degrees of domain shift towards it. Then, we employed the priors in a Decomposed Diffusion Sampling scheme on sparse-view CT data sets with increasing difficulty leading to the experimental data. Our results reveal that domain shift plays a nuanced role: while severe mismatch causes model collapse and hallucinations, diverse priors outperform well-matched but narrow priors. Forward model mismatch pulls the image samples away from the prior manifold, which causes artifacts but can be mitigated with annealed likelihood schedules that also increase computational efficiency. Overall, we demonstrate that performance gains do not immediately translate from synthetic to experimental data, and future development must validate against real-world benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56feX\u5c04\u7ebfCT\u7b49\u4e0d\u9002\u5b9a\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u4f53\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff08\u57df\u504f\u79fb\uff09\u548c\u6b63\u5411\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u914d\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5148\u9a8c\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\uff08\u57df\u504f\u79fb\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u6b63\u5411\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7269\u7406\u4f53\u6a21\u6d4b\u91cfCT\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u540c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u7684\u6269\u6563\u5148\u9a8c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u6269\u6563\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u96be\u5ea6\u9012\u589e\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56feCT\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3002", "result": "\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u5177\u6709\u53cc\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\uff1a\u4e25\u91cd\u5931\u914d\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u800c\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5339\u914d\u5ea6\u9ad8\u4f46\u8303\u56f4\u7a84\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\uff1b\u6b63\u5411\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u914d\u4f1a\u4f7f\u91c7\u6837\u504f\u79bb\u5148\u9a8c\u6d41\u5f62\u4ea7\u751f\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u9000\u706b\u4f3c\u7136\u8c03\u5ea6\u7f13\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0d\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u9700\u8981\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002"}}

This work introduces Fractional-Order Roughness-Informed Federated Averaging (FO-RI-FedAvg), a lightweight and modular extension of FedAvg that improves stability through two complementary client-side mechanisms: (i) adaptive roughness-informed proximal regularization, which dynamically tunes the pull toward the global model based on local loss-landscape roughness, and (ii) non-integer-order local optimization, which incorporates short-term memory to smooth conflicting update directions. The approach preserves standard FedAvg server aggregation, adds only element-wise operations with amortizable overhead, and allows independent toggling of each component.

Recent training-free approaches have attempted to overcome this constraint by introducing interventions during the denoising process; however, these methods incur substantial computational overhead, often requiring more than five minutes to produce a single 4K image. In this paper, we present PixelRush, the first tuning-free framework for practical high-resolution text-to-image generation. Our method builds upon the established patch-based inference paradigm but eliminates the need for multiple inversion and regeneration cycles. Instead, PixelRush enables efficient patch-based denoising within a low-step regime. To address artifacts introduced by patch blending in few-step generation, we propose a seamless blending strategy.

Recent findings suggest that RLVR primarily functions by eliciting latent capabilities, motivating the development of verifier-free algorithms. However, in such settings, standard methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization face a critical challenge: destructive gradient variance that often leads to training collapse. To address this issue, we introduceVerifier-Independent Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (VI-CuRL), a framework that leverages the model's intrinsic confidence to construct a curriculum independent from external verifiers. By prioritizing high-confidence samples, VI-CuRL effectively manages the bias-variance trade-off, specifically targeting the reduction of action and problem variance. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, proving that our estimator guarantees asymptotic unbiasedness.

Fully-supervised counting methods require costly point-level annotations per object. Few weakly-supervised methods leverage only image-level object counts as supervision and achieve fairly promising results. They are, however, often limited to counting a single category, e.g. person. In this paper, we propose WS-COC, the first MLLM-driven weakly-supervised framework for class-agnostic object counting. Instead of directly fine-tuning MLLMs to predict object counts, which can be challenging due to the modality gap, we incorporate three simple yet effective strategies to bootstrap the counting paradigm in both training and testing: First, a divide-and-discern dialogue tuning strategy is proposed to guide the MLLM to determine whether the object count falls within a specific range and progressively break down the range through multi-round dialogue. Second, a compare-and-rank count optimization strategy is introduced to train the MLLM to optimize the relative ranking of multiple images according to their object counts. Third, a global-and-local counting enhancement strategy aggregates and fuses local and global count predictions to improve counting performance in dense scenes. Extensive experiments on FSC-147, CARPK, PUCPR+, and ShanghaiTech show that WS-COC matches or even surpasses many state-of-art fully-supervised methods while significantly reducing annotation costs.

We attribute this gap to a pre-routing bottleneck: multi-head attention concatenates head-specific signals into a single post-attention router input, forcing routing to act on co-occurring feature compositions rather than separable head channels. We show that this router input simultaneously encodes multiple separately decodable semantic and structural factors with uneven head support, and that different feature compositions induce weakly aligned parameter-gradient directions; as a result, routing maps many distinct compositions to the same route. We quantify this collision effect via a route-wise effective composition number $N_{eff}$ and find that higher $N_{eff}$ is associated with larger old-task loss increases after continual training. Motivated by these findings, we propose MH-MoE, which performs head-wise routing over sub-representations to increase routing granularity and reduce composition collisions.

This paper presents a method to detect single-lane abnormalities by tracking individual vehicle paths and detecting vehicle lane changes along a section of a road. We propose a method to estimate the vehicle position at all time instances and fit a path using clustering techniques. We detect vehicle lane change by monitoring any change in spectral centroid of vehicle vibrations by tracking a reference vehicle along a highway.

Most medical large vision language models (LVLMs) perform visual inspection only once and then rely on text-only chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, which operates purely in the linguistic space and is prone to hallucination. Recent methods attempt to mitigate this issue by introducing visually related coordinates, such as bounding boxes. However, these remain a pseudo-visual solution: coordinates are still text and fail to preserve rich visual details like texture and density. Motivated by the interleaved nature of radiological diagnosis, we introduce MMRad-IVL-22K, the first large-scale dataset designed for natively interleaved visual language reasoning in chest X-ray interpretation. MMRad-IVL-22K reflects a repeated cycle of reasoning and visual inspection workflow of radiologists, in which visual rationales complement textual descriptions and ground each step of the reasoning process. MMRad-IVL-22K comprises 21,994 diagnostic traces, enabling systematic scanning across 35 anatomical regions. Experimental results on advanced closed-source LVLMs demonstrate that report generation guided by multimodal CoT significantly outperforms that guided by text-only CoT in clinical accuracy and report quality (e.g., 6\\% increase in the RadGraph metric), confirming that high-fidelity interleaved vision language evidence is a non-substitutable component of reliable medical AI. Furthermore, benchmarking across seven state-of-the-art open-source LVLMs demonstrates that models fine-tuned on MMRad-IVL-22K achieve superior reasoning consistency and report quality compared with both general-purpose and medical-specific LVLMs. The project page is available at https://github.com/qiuzyc/thinking_like_a_radiologist.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We advocate a simpler and more unified perspective: an autoregressive attention head can be viewed as a dynamic two-layer MLP whose weights are instantiated from the context history. From this view, attention scores form an ever-growing hidden representation, and standard MLP activations such as ReLU or GLU naturally implement input-conditioned selection over a context-dependent memory pool rather than a probability distribution. Based on this formulation, we introduce HyperMLP and HyperGLU, which learn dynamic mixing in both feature space and sequence space, using a reverse-offset (lag) layout to align temporal mixing with autoregressive semantics.

However, the lack of an efficient evaluation framework impedes the diagnosis of their performance bottlenecks. Current evaluation primarily relies on testing after supervised fine-tuning, which introduces laborious additional training and autoregressive decoding costs. Meanwhile, common pre-training metrics cannot quantify a model's perception and reasoning abilities in a disentangled manner. Furthermore, existing evaluation benchmarks are typically limited in scale or misaligned with pre-training objectives. Thus, we propose RADAR, an efficient ability-centric evaluation framework for Revealing Asymmetric Development of Abilities in MLLM pRe-training. RADAR involves two key components: (1) Soft Discrimination Score, a novel metric for robustly tracking ability development without fine-tuning, based on quantifying nuanced gradations of the model preference for the correct answer over distractors; and (2) Multi-Modal Mixture Benchmark, a new 15K+ sample benchmark for comprehensively evaluating pre-trained MLLMs' perception and reasoning abilities in a 0-shot manner, where we unify authoritative benchmark datasets and carefully collect new datasets, extending the evaluation scope and addressing the critical gaps in current benchmarks. With RADAR, we comprehensively reveal the asymmetric development of perceptual and reasoning capabilities in pretrained MLLMs across diverse factors, including data volume, model size, and pretraining strategy.

This paper proposes a method for evaluating the robustness of object detection ML models in autonomous vehicles under adverse weather conditions. It employs data augmentation operators to generate synthetic data that simulates different severance degrees of the adverse operation conditions at progressive intensity levels to find the lowest intensity of the adverse conditions at which the object detection model fails. The robustness of the object detection model is measured by the average first failure coefficients (AFFC) over the input images in the benchmark. The paper reports an experiment with four object detection models: YOLOv5s, YOLOv11s, Faster R-CNN, and Detectron2, utilising seven data augmentation operators that simulate weather conditions fog, rain, and snow, and lighting conditions of dark, bright, flaring, and shadow. The experiment data show that the method is feasible, effective, and efficient to evaluate and compare the robustness of object detection models in various adverse operation conditions. In particular, the Faster R-CNN model achieved the highest robustness with an overall average AFFC of 71.9% over all seven adverse conditions, while YOLO variants showed the AFFC values of 43%. The method is also applied to assess the impact of model training that targets adverse operation conditions using synthetic data on model robustness. It is observed that such training can improve robustness in adverse conditions but may suffer from diminishing returns and forgetting phenomena (i.e., decline in robustness) if overtrained.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

As this paradigm evolves toward larger models and relational foundation models, scalable and realistic benchmarks are essential for enabling systematic evaluation and progress. In this paper, we introduce RelBench v2, a major expansion of the RelBench benchmark for RDL. RelBench v2 adds four large-scale relational datasets spanning scholarly publications, enterprise resource planning, consumer platforms, and clinical records, increasing the benchmark to 11 datasets comprising over 22 million rows across 29 tables. We further introduce autocomplete tasks, a new class of predictive objectives that require models to infer missing attribute values directly within relational tables while respecting temporal constraints, expanding beyond traditional forecasting tasks constructed via SQL queries. In addition, RelBench v2 expands beyond its native datasets by integrating external benchmarks and evaluation frameworks: we translate event streams from the Temporal Graph Benchmark into relational schemas for unified relational-temporal evaluation, interface with ReDeLEx to provide uniform access to 70+ real-world databases suitable for pretraining, and incorporate 4DBInfer datasets and tasks to broaden multi-table prediction coverage. Experimental results demonstrate that RDL models consistently outperform single-table baselines across autocomplete, forecasting, and recommendation tasks, highlighting the importance of modeling relational structure explicitly.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, the success of existing TWI methods heavily relies on the assumption that interleaved image-text CoTs are faultless, which is easily violated in real-world scenarios due to the complexity of multimodal understanding. In this paper, we reveal and study a highly-practical yet under-explored problem in TWI, termed Noisy Thinking (NT). Specifically, NT refers to the imperfect visual cues mining and answer reasoning process. As the saying goes, ``One mistake leads to another'', erroneous interleaved CoT would cause error accumulation, thus significantly degrading the performance of MLLMs. To solve the NT problem, we propose a novel method dubbed Reliable Thinking with Images (RTWI). In brief, RTWI estimates the reliability of visual cues and textual CoT in a unified text-centric manner and accordingly employs robust filtering and voting modules to prevent NT from contaminating the final answer. Extensive experiments on seven benchmarks verify the effectiveness of RTWI against NT.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recognizing the current scarcity of dedicated datasets in this domain, we introduce EPRBench, a high-quality benchmark specifically designed for event stream-based VPR. EPRBench comprises 10K event sequences and 65K event frames, collected using both handheld and vehicle-mounted setups to comprehensively capture real-world challenges across diverse viewpoints, weather conditions, and lighting scenarios. To support semantic-aware and language-integrated VPR research, we provide LLM-generated scene descriptions, subsequently refined through human annotation, establishing a solid foundation for integrating LLMs into event-based perception pipelines. To facilitate systematic evaluation, we implement and benchmark 15 state-of-the-art VPR algorithms on EPRBench, offering a strong baseline for future algorithmic comparisons. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal fusion paradigm for VPR: leveraging LLMs to generate textual scene descriptions from raw event streams, which then guide spatially attentive token selection, cross-modal feature fusion, and multi-scale representation learning. This framework not only achieves highly accurate place recognition but also produces interpretable reasoning processes alongside its predictions, significantly enhancing model transparency and explainability.

While prior work focuses on training objectives or individual solvers, the holistic design of sampling, specifically solver selection and scheduling, remains dominated by static heuristics. In this work, we revisit this challenge through a geometric lens, proposing SDM, a principled framework that aligns the numerical solver with the intrinsic properties of the diffusion trajectory. By analyzing the ODE dynamics, we show that efficient low-order solvers suffice in early high-noise stages while higher-order solvers can be progressively deployed to handle the increasing non-linearity of later stages. Furthermore, we formalize the scheduling by introducing a Wasserstein-bounded optimization framework. This method systematically derives adaptive timesteps that explicitly bound the local discretization error, ensuring the sampling process remains faithful to the underlying continuous dynamics. Without requiring additional training or architectural modifications, SDM achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard benchmarks, including an FID of 1.93 on CIFAR-10, 2.41 on FFHQ, and 1.98 on AFHQv2, with a reduced number of function evaluations compared to existing samplers.

Intrapartum biometry plays a critical role in monitoring labor progression; however, the routine use of ultrasound in resource-limited settings is hindered by a shortage of trained sonographers. To address this challenge, the Intrapartum Ultrasound Grand Challenge (IUGC), co-hosted with MICCAI 2024, was launched. The IUGC introduces a clinically oriented multi-task automatic measurement framework that integrates standard plane classification, fetal head-pubic symphysis segmentation, and biometry, enabling algorithms to exploit complementary task information for more accurate estimation. Furthermore, the challenge releases the largest multi-center intrapartum ultrasound video dataset to date, comprising 774 videos (68,106 frames) collected from three hospitals, providing a robust foundation for model training and evaluation. In this study, we present a comprehensive overview of the challenge design, review the submissions from eight participating teams, and analyze their methods from five perspectives: preprocessing, data augmentation, learning strategy, model architecture, and post-processing.

Trajectory success rewards are suitable for human judges or model fitting, but the sparsity severely limits RL sample efficiency. While recent methods have effectively improved RL via dense rewards, they rely heavily on high-quality human-annotated data or abundant expert supervision. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes Dual-granularity contrastive reward via generated Episodic Guidance (DEG), a novel framework to seek sample-efficient dense rewards without requiring human annotations or extensive supervision. Leveraging the prior knowledge of large video generation models, DEG only needs a small number of expert videos for domain adaptation to generate dedicated task guidance for each RL episode. Then, the proposed dual-granularity reward that balances coarse-grained exploration and fine-grained matching, will guide the agent to efficiently approximate the generated guidance video sequentially in the contrastive self-supervised latent space, and finally complete the target task. Extensive experiments on 18 diverse tasks across both simulation and real-world settings show that DEG can not only serve as an efficient exploration stimulus to help the agent quickly discover sparse success rewards, but also guide effective RL and stable policy convergence independently.", "AI": {"tldr": "DEG\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u60c5\u666f\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u53cc\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u5927\u91cf\u4e13\u5bb6\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u6837\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u6216\u5927\u91cf\u4e13\u5bb6\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u800c\u8f68\u8ff9\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5956\u52b1\u867d\u7136\u9002\u5408\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f46\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u4e25\u91cd\u9650\u5236\u4e86RL\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDEG\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u4e13\u5bb6\u89c6\u9891\u8fdb\u884c\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2aRL\u60c5\u666f\u751f\u6210\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6307\u5bfc\uff1b2\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e73\u8861\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\u7684\u53cc\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5728\u5bf9\u6bd4\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u5f15\u5bfc\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u9010\u6b65\u903c\u8fd1\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\u89c6\u9891", "result": "\u5728\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u768418\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a1\uff09DEG\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u523a\u6fc0\u5e2e\u52a9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u73b0\u7a00\u758f\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5956\u52b1\uff1b2\uff09\u80fd\u591f\u72ec\u7acb\u5f15\u5bfc\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6536\u655b", "conclusion": "DEG\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u548c\u53cc\u7c92\u5ea6\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u5927\u91cf\u4e13\u5bb6\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u6837\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u5bc6\u96c6\u5956\u52b1\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5177\u8eab\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd"}}

We propose a fully differentiable, deep-learning-based deformable registration framework that aligns individual pathological brains to a common atlas while preserving metastatic tissue without requiring lesion masks or preprocessing.\n  Missing anatomical correspondences caused by metastases are handled through a forward-model similarity metric based on distance-transformed anatomical labels, combined with a volume-preserving regularization term to ensure deformation plausibility. Registration performance was evaluated using Dice coefficient (DSC), Hausdorff distance (HD), average symmetric surface distance (ASSD), and Jacobian-based measures. The method was applied to 209 MBM patients from three centres, enabling standardized mapping of metastases to anatomical, arterial, and perfusion atlases.\n  The framework achieved high registration accuracy across datasets (DSC 0.89-0.92, HD 6.79-7.60 mm, ASSD 0.63-0.77 mm) while preserving metastatic volumes. Spatial analysis demonstrated significant over-representation of MBM in the cerebral cortex and putamen, under-representation in white matter, and consistent localization near the gray-white matter junction. No arterial territory showed increased metastasis frequency after volume correction.\n  This approach enables robust atlas registration of pathological brain MRI without lesion masks and supports reproducible multi-centre analyses. Applied to MBM, it confirms and refines known spatial predilections, particularly preferential seeding near the gray-white matter junction and cortical regions.

Benefiting from strong semantic modeling and robust generalization, VLM-based end-to-end approaches have emerged as the mainstream paradigm in recent years. However, these models often suffer from substantial inference latency, as they must auto-regressively generate long token sequences when processing long-form documents. In this work, motivated by the extremely long outputs and complex layout structures commonly found in document parsing, we propose a training-free and highly efficient acceleration method. Inspired by speculative decoding, we employ a lightweight document parsing pipeline as a draft model to predict batches of future tokens, while the more accurate VLM verifies these draft predictions in parallel. Moreover, we further exploit the layout-structured nature of documents by partitioning each page into independent regions, enabling parallel decoding of each region using the same draft-verify strategy. The final predictions are then assembled according to the natural reading order. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: on the general-purpose OmniDocBench, our method provides a 2.42x lossless acceleration for the dots.ocr model, and achieves up to 4.89x acceleration on long-document parsing tasks.

Deployed tracking systems usually lack formal safety assurances to convey when tracking is reliable and when it may fail, at best relying on heuristic measures of model confidence to raise alerts. To obtain such assurances we propose interpreting object tracking as a sequential hypothesis test, wherein evidence for or against tracking failures is gradually accumulated over time. Leveraging recent advancements in the field, our sequential test (formalized as an e-process) quickly identifies when tracking failures set in whilst provably containing false alerts at a desired rate, and thus limiting potentially costly re-calibration or intervention steps. The approach is computationally light-weight, requires no extra training or fine-tuning, and is in principle model-agnostic. We propose both supervised and unsupervised variants by leveraging either ground-truth or solely internal tracking information, and demonstrate its effectiveness for two established tracking models across four video benchmarks. As such, sequential testing can offer a statistically grounded and efficient mechanism to incorporate safety assurances into real-time tracking systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u89c6\u4e3a\u5e8f\u8d2f\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7e-process\u7d2f\u79ef\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5931\u8d25\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u5047\u8b66\u62a5\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5feb\u901f\u8bc6\u522b\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6545\u969c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u89c6\u9891\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u53ef\u9760\u5224\u65ad\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4f55\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u3001\u4f55\u65f6\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u80fd\u4f9d\u9760\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6d4b\u91cf\u53d1\u51fa\u8b66\u62a5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u76ee\u6807\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u5e8f\u8d2f\u5047\u8bbe\u68c0\u9a8c\uff0c\u6784\u5efae-process\u6e10\u8fdb\u7d2f\u79ef\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5931\u8d25\u8bc1\u636e\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u6027\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u4e24\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\uff1a\u76d1\u7763\u7248\u672c\u5229\u7528\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u7248\u672c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5185\u90e8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6210\u719f\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u56db\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u80fd\u591f\u5feb\u901f\u8bc6\u522b\u8ddf\u8e2a\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u5047\u8b66\u62a5\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u671f\u671b\u6bd4\u7387\u5185\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e8f\u8d2f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u8ba1\u57fa\u7840\u5f3a\u3001\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4fdd\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9650\u5236\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u6821\u51c6\u6216\u5e72\u9884\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002"}}

While this idea is well established, teachers trained with conventional cross-entropy often fail to preserve such signals. Their distributions collapse into sharp, overconfident peaks that appear decisive but are in fact brittle, offering little beyond the hard label or subtly hindering representation-level transfer. This overconfidence is especially problematic in high-cardinality tasks, where the nuances among many plausible classes matter most for guiding a compact student. Moreover, such brittle targets reduce robustness under distribution shift, leaving students vulnerable to miscalibration in real-world conditions. To address this limitation, we revisit distillation from a distributional perspective and propose Calibrated Uncertainty Distillation (CUD), a framework designed to make dark knowledge more faithfully accessible. Instead of uncritically adopting the teacher's overconfidence, CUD encourages teachers to reveal uncertainty where it is informative and guides students to learn from targets that are calibrated rather than sharpened certainty. By directly shaping the teacher's predictive distribution before transfer, our approach balances accuracy and calibration, allowing students to benefit from both confident signals on easy cases and structured uncertainty on hard ones. Across diverse benchmarks, CUD yields students that are not only more accurate, but also more calibrated under shift and more reliable on ambiguous, long-tail inputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing adaptive methods require training auxiliary models. We propose Leverage-Weighted Conformal Prediction (LWCP), which weights nonconformity scores by a function of the statistical leverage -- the diagonal of the hat matrix -- deriving adaptivity from the geometry of the design matrix rather than from auxiliary model fitting. We prove that LWCP preserves finite-sample marginal validity for any weight function; achieves asymptotically optimal conditional coverage at essentially no width cost when heteroscedasticity factors through leverage; and recovers the form and width of classical prediction intervals under Gaussian assumptions while retaining distribution-free guarantees.

The method requires no hyperparameters beyond the choice of weight function and adds negligible computational overhead to vanilla CP.

However, recent studies reveal that joint learning often overfits certain modalities while neglecting others, leading to performance inferior to that of unimodal learning. Although previous efforts have sought to balance modal contributions or combine joint and unimodal learning, thereby mitigating the degradation of weaker modalities with promising outcomes, few have examined the relationship between joint and unimodal learning from an information-theoretic perspective. In this paper, we theoretically analyze modality competition and propose a method for multimodal classification by maximizing the total correlation between multimodal features and labels. By maximizing this objective, our approach alleviates modality competition while capturing inter-modal interactions via feature alignment. Building on Mutual Information Neural Estimation (MINE), we introduce Total Correlation Neural Estimation (TCNE) to derive a lower bound for total correlation. Subsequently, we present TCMax, a hyperparameter-free loss function that maximizes total correlation through variational bound optimization.

Rather than conducting walks on graphs' nodes, those methods rely on walks in continuous spaces, in which those graphs are embedded.

It enables dense scene understanding without human annotations, which is especially valuable in domains where labelled data is scarce. However, existing methods often struggle to reconcile global semantic structure with fine-grained boundary accuracy. This paper introduces DynaGuide, an adaptive segmentation framework that addresses these challenges through a novel dual-guidance strategy and dynamic loss optimization. Building on our previous work, DynaSeg, DynaGuide combines global pseudo-labels from zero-shot models such as DiffSeg or SegFormer with local boundary refinement using a lightweight CNN trained from scratch. This synergy allows the model to correct coarse or noisy global predictions and produce high-precision segmentations. At the heart of DynaGuide is a multi-component loss that dynamically balances feature similarity, Huber-smoothed spatial continuity, including diagonal relationships, and semantic alignment with the global pseudo-labels. Unlike prior approaches, DynaGuide trains entirely without ground-truth labels in the target domain and supports plug-and-play integration of diverse guidance sources. Extensive experiments on BSD500, PASCAL VOC2012, and COCO demonstrate that DynaGuide achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving mIoU by 17.5% on BSD500, 3.1% on PASCAL VOC2012, and 11.66% on COCO. With its modular design, strong generalization, and minimal computational footprint, DynaGuide offers a scalable and practical solution for unsupervised segmentation in real-world settings.

However, purely data-driven models often require extensive training data and can generalize poorly, especially in small-data regimes and under unseen (out-of-distribution) input functions that are not represented in the training data. To address these limitations, we propose the Physics-Informed Laplace Neural Operator (PILNO), which enhances the Laplace Neural Operator (LNO) by embedding governing physics into training through PDE, boundary condition, and initial condition residuals. To improve expressivity, we first introduce an Advanced LNO (ALNO) backbone that retains a pole-residue transient representation while replacing the steady-state branch with an FNO-style Fourier multiplier. To make physics-informed training both data-efficient and robust, PILNO further leverages (i) virtual inputs: an unlabeled ensemble of input functions spanning a broad spectral range that provides abundant physics-only supervision and explicitly targets out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes; and (ii) temporal-causality weighting: a time-decaying reweighting of the physics residual that prioritizes early-time dynamics and stabilizes optimization for time-dependent PDEs. Across four representative benchmarks -- Burgers' equation, Darcy flow, a reaction-diffusion system, and a forced KdV equation -- PILNO consistently improves accuracy in small-data settings (e.g., N_train <= 27), reduces run-to-run variability across random seeds, and achieves stronger OOD generalization than purely data-driven baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "PILNO\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u548c\u865a\u62df\u8f93\u5165\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5c11\u548c\u672a\u89c1\u8f93\u5165\uff08\u5206\u5e03\u5916\uff09\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u63d0\u5347\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u5d4c\u5165\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPILNO\uff08\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u62c9\u666e\u62c9\u65af\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\uff09\uff0c\u5b83\u57fa\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u7684ALNO\uff08\u9ad8\u7ea7LNO\uff09\u4e3b\u5e72\uff0c\u5c06\u7a33\u6001\u5206\u652f\u66ff\u6362\u4e3aFNO\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u4e58\u6cd5\u5668\u3002PILNO\u91c7\u7528\u865a\u62df\u8f93\u5165\uff08\u5bbd\u9891\u8c31\u7684\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u8f93\u5165\u51fd\u6570\u96c6\u5408\uff09\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u56e0\u679c\u52a0\u6743\uff08\u65f6\u95f4\u8870\u51cf\u7684\u7269\u7406\u6b8b\u5dee\u6743\u91cd\uff09\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728Burgers\u65b9\u7a0b\u3001\u8fbe\u897f\u6d41\u3001\u53cd\u5e94\u6269\u6563\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u5f3a\u8febKdV\u65b9\u7a0b\u56db\u4e2a\u5178\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPILNO\u5728\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff08\u5982N_train\u226427\uff09\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u79cd\u5b50\u95f4\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u76f8\u6bd4\u7eaf\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u57fa\u7ebf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "PILNO\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u5d4c\u5165\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, most existing VFL frameworks rely on the idealized assumption of full sample alignment across participants, a premise that rarely holds in real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, this work introduces Split-MoPE, a novel framework that integrates Split Learning with a specialized Mixture of Predefined Experts (MoPE) architecture. Unlike standard Mixture of Experts (MoE), where routing is learned dynamically, MoPE uses predefined experts to process specific data alignments, effectively maximizing data usage during both training and inference without requiring full sample overlap. By leveraging pretrained encoders for target data domains, Split-MoPE achieves state-of-the-art performance in a single communication round, significantly reducing the communication footprint compared to multi-round end-to-end training. Furthermore, unlike existing proposals that address sample misalignment, this novel architecture provides inherent robustness against malicious or noisy participants and offers per-sample interpretability by quantifying each collaborator's contribution to each prediction. Extensive evaluations on vision (CIFAR-10/100) and tabular (Breast Cancer Wisconsin) datasets demonstrate that Split-MoPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems such as LASER and Vertical SplitNN, particularly in challenging scenarios with high data missingness.", "AI": {"tldr": "Split-MoPE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u5782\u76f4\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5206\u88c2\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u6837\u672c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u8f6e\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5782\u76f4\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5927\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6837\u672c\u5b8c\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7406\u60f3\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7f55\u89c1\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u6837\u672c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e14\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSplit-MoPE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u5206\u88c2\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e13\u5bb6\u5904\u7406\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5355\u8f6e\u901a\u4fe1\u5373\u53ef\u5b8c\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cSplit-MoPE\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u5931\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8eLASER\u3001Vertical SplitNN\u7b49\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u6297\u6076\u610f\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6837\u672c\u7ea7\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "Split-MoPE\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5782\u76f4\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6837\u672c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u3002"}}

We propose GRAIL, a framework that models longitudinal EHRs using structured geometric representations and structure-aware retrieval.

At inference time, GRAIL retrieves a structured set of clinically plausible future events aligned with hierarchical and temporal progression, and optionally refines their ranking using an LLM as a constrained inference-time reranker.

Such metrics frequently reward visually plausible outputs while overlooking controllability, edit localization, and faithfulness to user instructions. In this work, we introduce a fine-grained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-as-a-Judge framework for image editing that decomposes common evaluation notions into twelve fine-grained interpretable factors spanning image preservation, edit quality, and instruction fidelity. Building on this formulation, we present a new human-validated benchmark that integrates human judgments, MLLM-based evaluations, model outputs, and traditional metrics across diverse image editing tasks. Through extensive human studies, we show that the proposed MLLM judges align closely with human evaluations at a fine granularity, supporting their use as reliable and scalable evaluators. We further demonstrate that traditional image editing metrics are often poor proxies for these factors, failing to distinguish over-edited or semantically imprecise outputs, whereas our judges provide more intuitive and informative assessments in both offline and online settings. Together, this work introduces a benchmark, a principled factorization, and empirical evidence positioning fine-grained MLLM judges as a practical foundation for studying, comparing, and improving image editing approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In contrast, self-supervised speech encoders such as WavLM provide strong acoustic representations yet remain opaque discriminative models with limited interpretability. To bridge this gap, we introduce ADEPT (Agentic Decoding of Emotion via Evidence Probing Tools), a framework that reframes emotion recognition as a multi-turn inquiry process rather than a single-pass prediction. ADEPT transforms an SLLM into an agent that maintains an evolving candidate emotion set and adaptively invokes dedicated semantic and acoustic probing tools within a structured pipeline of candidate generation, evidence collection, and adjudication. Crucially, ADEPT enables a paradigm shift from consensus learning to ambiguity-driven emotion reasoning. Since human affect exhibits inherent complexity and frequent co-occurrence of emotions, we treat minority annotations as informative perceptual signals rather than discarding them as noise. Finally, we integrate Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with an Evidence Trust Gate to explicitly couple tool-usage behaviors with prediction quality and enforce evidence-grounded reasoning. Experiments show that ADEPT improves primary emotion accuracy in most settings while substantially improving minor emotion characterization, producing explanations grounded in auditable acoustic and semantic evidence.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this, we propose Field Least-Energy Actor-Critic (FLAC), a likelihood-free framework that regulates policy stochasticity by penalizing the kinetic energy of the velocity field. Our key insight is to formulate policy optimization as a Generalized Schr\u00f6dinger Bridge (GSB) problem relative to a high-entropy reference process (e.g., uniform). Under this view, the maximum-entropy principle emerges naturally as staying close to a high-entropy reference while optimizing return, without requiring explicit action densities. In this framework, kinetic energy serves as a physically grounded proxy for divergence from the reference: minimizing path-space energy bounds the deviation of the induced terminal action distribution. Building on this view, we derive an energy-regularized policy iteration scheme and a practical off-policy algorithm that automatically tunes the kinetic energy via a Lagrangian dual mechanism. Empirically, FLAC achieves superior or comparable performance on high-dimensional benchmarks relative to strong baselines, while avoiding explicit density estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing dietary assessment methods largely rely on single-image analysis or appearance-based inference, including recent vision-language models, which lack explicit geometric reasoning and are sensitive to scale ambiguity. This benchmark reframes food portion estimation as an implicit-scale 3D reconstruction problem under monocular observations. To reflect real-world conditions, explicit physical references and metric annotations are removed; instead, contextual objects such as plates and utensils are provided, requiring algorithms to infer scale from implicit cues and prior knowledge.

We introduce TRACE (Temporal Reasoning via Agentic Context Evolution), a framework that enables temporal clinical reasoning with frozen LLMs by explicitly structuring and maintaining context rather than extending context windows or updating parameters. TRACE operates over a dual-memory architecture consisting of a static Global Protocol encoding institutional clinical rules and a dynamic Individual Protocol tracking patient-specific state. Four agentic components, Router, Reasoner, Auditor, and Steward, coordinate over this structured memory to support temporal inference and state evolution. The framework maintains bounded inference cost via structured state compression and selectively audits safety-critical clinical decisions.

However, neither RLHF nor DPO take into account the fact that learning certain preferences is more difficult than learning other preferences, rendering the optimization process suboptimal. To address this gap in text-to-image generation, we recently proposed Curriculum-DPO, a method that organizes image pairs by difficulty. In this paper, we introduce Curriculum-DPO++, an enhanced method that combines the original data-level curriculum with a novel model-level curriculum. More precisely, we propose to dynamically increase the learning capacity of the denoising network as training advances. We implement this capacity increase via two mechanisms. First, we initialize the model with only a subset of the trainable layers used in the original Curriculum-DPO. As training progresses, we sequentially unfreeze layers until the configuration matches the full baseline architecture. Second, as the fine-tuning is based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we implement a progressive schedule for the dimension of the low-rank matrices. Instead of maintaining a fixed capacity, we initialize the low-rank matrices with a dimension significantly smaller than that of the baseline. As training proceeds, we incrementally increase their rank, allowing the capacity to grow until it converges to the same rank value as in Curriculum-DPO. Furthermore, we propose an alternative ranking strategy to the one employed by Curriculum-DPO. Finally, we compare Curriculum-DPO++ against Curriculum-DPO and other state-of-the-art preference optimization approaches on nine benchmarks, outperforming the competing methods in terms of text alignment, aesthetics and human preference.

However, the classical SR is limited by its inherent policy dependence: policies change due to ongoing learning, environmental non-stationarities, and changes in task demands, making established predictive representations obsolete. Furthermore, in topologically complex environments, SRs suffer from spectral diffusion, leading to dense and overlapping features that scale poorly. Here we propose the Hierarchical Successor Representation (HSR) for overcoming these limitations. By incorporating temporal abstractions into the construction of predictive representations, HSR learns stable state features which are robust to task-induced policy changes. Applying non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF) to the HSR yields a sparse, low-rank state representation that facilitates highly sample-efficient transfer to novel tasks in multi-compartmental environments. Further analysis reveals that HSR-NMF discovers interpretable topological structures, providing a policy-agnostic hierarchical map that effectively bridges model-free optimality and model-based flexibility.

We theoretically characterize this phenomenon as a \"Normalization Squeeze,\" where the interplay between mode-seeking policy gradients and finite sampling acts as a high-pass likelihood filter, driving the probability of rare correct traces to statistical extinction. To counteract this collapse without discarding the base model's latent diversity, we propose Amortized Reasoning Tree Search (ARTS). Unlike standard approaches that force internalization via parameter updates, ARTS prioritizes deliberation by decoupling generation from verification. We introduce a Flow Matching objective that repurposes the verifier to estimate the conservation of probability flow, enabling robust navigation through sparse, high-entropy search spaces where traditional discriminative objectives fail. Extensive experiments on the MATH-500 benchmark demonstrate that ARTS achieves a performance of 74.6% (BoN@16), effectively matching fully fine-tuned policies (74.7%) without modifying the generative backbone.

Unlike standard methods that passively propagate errors, F-LLM actively stabilizes the trajectory via a learnable residual estimator (Observer) and a feedback controller. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical guarantee that our closed-loop mechanism ensures uniformly bounded error, provided the base model satisfies a local Lipschitz constraint. Extensive experiments demonstrate that F-LLM significantly mitigates error propagation, achieving good performance on time series benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faF-LLM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u65ad\u9636\u6bb5\u4ee5\u5f00\u73af\u65b9\u5f0f\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u6d88\u8017\u81ea\u8eab\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5fae\u5c0f\u8bef\u5dee\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7d2f\u79ef\u5e76\u5f15\u53d1\u663e\u8457\u8f68\u8ff9\u6f02\u79fb\uff08\u66b4\u9732\u504f\u5dee\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faF-LLM\uff08\u53cd\u9988\u9a71\u52a8LLM\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5c06\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9884\u6d4b\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u95ee\u9898\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff08Observer\uff09\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u95ed\u73af\u673a\u5236\uff1b3\uff09\u5728\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6ee1\u8db3\u5c40\u90e8Lipschitz\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8bef\u5dee\u6709\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eF-LLM\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u8f7b\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "F-LLM\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u673a\u5236\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Tracking how vortices move, weaken, and dissipate over time from LiDAR measurements is still difficult because scans are sparse, vortex signatures fade as the flow breaks down under atmospheric turbulence and instabilities, and point-wise annotation is prohibitively expensive. Existing approaches largely treat each scan as an independent, fully supervised segmentation problem, which overlooks temporal structure and does not scale to the vast unlabeled archives collected in practice. We present X-VORTEX, a spatio-temporal contrastive learning framework grounded in Augmentation Overlap Theory that learns physics-aware representations from unlabeled LiDAR point cloud sequences. X-VORTEX addresses two core challenges: sensor sparsity and time-varying vortex dynamics. It constructs paired inputs from the same underlying flight event by combining a weakly perturbed sequence with a strongly augmented counterpart produced via temporal subsampling and spatial masking, encouraging the model to align representations across missing frames and partial observations. Architecturally, a time-distributed geometric encoder extracts per-scan features and a sequential aggregator models the evolving vortex state across variable-length sequences. We evaluate on a real-world dataset of over one million LiDAR scans.

Anomaly detection is typically formulated as a one-class classification problem, where the training data consists solely of nominal values, leaving methods built on this assumption susceptible to training label noise. We present a dataset folding method that transforms an arbitrary one-class classifier-based anomaly detector into a fully unsupervised method. This is achieved by making a set of key weak assumptions: that anomalies are uncommon in the training dataset and generally heterogeneous. These assumptions enable us to utilize multiple independently trained instances of a one-class classifier to filter the training dataset for anomalies. This transformation requires no modifications to the underlying anomaly detector; the only changes are algorithmically selected data subsets used for training. We demonstrate that our method can transform a wide variety of one-class classifier anomaly detectors for both images and videos into unsupervised ones. Our method creates the first unsupervised logical anomaly detectors by transforming existing methods. We also demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance for unsupervised anomaly detection on the MVTec AD, ViSA, and MVTec Loco AD datasets.

Existing autoregressive models often fail when processing long sequences. They typically anchor poses to the first frame, which leads to attention decay, scale drift, and extrapolation errors. We introduce LongStream, a novel gauge-decoupled streaming visual geometry model for metric-scale scene reconstruction across thousands of frames. Our approach is threefold. First, we discard the first-frame anchor and predict keyframe-relative poses. This reformulates long-range extrapolation into a constant-difficulty local task. Second, we introduce orthogonal scale learning. This method fully disentangles geometry from scale estimation to suppress drift. Finally, we solve Transformer cache issues such as attention-sink reliance and long-term KV-cache contamination. We propose cache-consistent training combined with periodic cache refresh. This approach suppresses attention degradation over ultra-long sequences and reduces the gap between training and inference. Experiments show LongStream achieves state-of-the-art performance. It delivers stable, metric-scale reconstruction over kilometer-scale sequences at 18 FPS.

Objective assessment and validation of these techniques for specific clinically oriented tasks are crucial for their adoption in clinical motion analysis. AI-driven monocular MMC reduces the barriers to adoption in the clinic and has the potential to reduce the overhead for analysis of this common clinical assessment. Nine adult participants with no impairments performed the standardized UERW task, which entails reaching targets distributed across a virtual sphere centered on the torso, with targets displayed in a VR headset. Movements were simultaneously captured using a marker-based motion capture system and a set of eight FLIR cameras. We performed monocular video analysis on two of these video camera views to compare a frontal and offset camera configurations. The frontal camera orientation demonstrated strong agreement with the marker-based reference, exhibiting a minimal mean bias of $0.61 \\pm 0.12$ \\% reachspace reached per octanct (mean $\\pm$ standard deviation). In contrast, the offset camera view underestimated the percent workspace reached ($-5.66 \\pm 0.45$ \\% reachspace reached). Conclusion: The findings support the feasibility of a frontal monocular camera configuration for UERW assessment, particularly for anterior workspace evaluation where agreement with marker-based motion capture was highest. The overall performance demonstrates clinical potential for practical, single-camera assessments. This study provides the first validation of monocular MMC system for the assessment of the UERW task. By reducing technical complexity, this approach enables broader implementation of quantitative upper extremity mobility assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u76ee\u76f8\u673a\u548cAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u52a8\u4f5c\u6355\u6349\u6280\u672f\u91cf\u5316\u4e0a\u80a2\u53ef\u8fbe\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6b63\u9762\u76f8\u673a\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6807\u8bb0\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u6280\u672f\u7b80\u5316\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u666e\u53ca\u3002", "motivation": "\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u76ee\u76f8\u673a\u548cAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u52a8\u4f5c\u6355\u6349\u6280\u672f\u91cf\u5316\u4e0a\u80a2\u53ef\u8fbe\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff08UERW\uff09\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u6807\u8bb0\u5f0f\u52a8\u4f5c\u6355\u6349\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u6280\u672f\u590d\u6742\u6027\u9ad8\u3001\u8bbe\u5907\u6210\u672c\u6602\u8d35\u7b49\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8be5\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u666e\u53ca\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u62db\u52df\u4e869\u540d\u65e0\u969c\u788d\u6210\u4eba\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684UERW\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5728VR\u5934\u663e\u4e2d\u663e\u793a\u865a\u62df\u7403\u4f53\u4e0a\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u70b9\uff0c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u4f38\u624b\u63a5\u89e6\u76ee\u6807\u70b9\uff09\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u5957\u7cfb\u7edf\u540c\u6b65\u91c7\u96c6\u8fd0\u52a8\u6570\u636e\uff1a1\uff09\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\u5f0f\u52a8\u4f5c\u6355\u6349\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53c2\u7167\u6807\u51c6\uff09\uff0c\u5305\u542b8\u4e2aFLIR\u76f8\u673a\uff1b2\uff09\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ece\u516b\u4e2a\u76f8\u673a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u4e24\u4e2a\u8fdb\u884c\u5355\u76ee\u89c6\u9891\u5206\u6790\uff08\u6bd4\u8f83\u6b63\u9762\u548c\u504f\u79fb\u4e24\u79cd\u76f8\u673a\u914d\u7f6e\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u6b63\u9762\u76f8\u673a\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0e\u6807\u8bb0\u5f0f\u53c2\u7167\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u504f\u5dee\u6781\u5c0f\uff08\u6bcf\u516b\u5206\u533a\u5230\u8fbe\u7684\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\u4e3a$0.61 \\pm 0.12$ % mean \u00b1 SD\uff09\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u504f\u79fb\u76f8\u673a\u89c6\u89d2\u4f4e\u4f30\u4e86\u5230\u8fbe\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u767e\u5206\u6bd4\uff08$-5.66 \\pm 0.45$ %\uff09\u3002\u6b63\u9762\u76f8\u673a\u5728\u524d\u90e8\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u9762\u4e0e\u6807\u8bb0\u5f0f\u52a8\u4f5c\u6355\u6349\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6700\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u652f\u6301\u6b63\u9762\u5355\u76ee\u76f8\u673a\u914d\u7f6e\u5728UERW\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5728\u524d\u90e8\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u964d\u4f4e\u6280\u672f\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u65bd\u5b9a\u91cf\u7684\u4e0a\u80a2\u6d3b\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u662f\u672c\u9886\u57df\u9996\u6b21\u5bf9\u5355\u76ee\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u52a8\u4f5c\u6355\u6349\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728UERW\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

This signal represents video dynamics as a point cloud, introducing three key enhancements: multi-frequency positional encoding to distinguish fine-grained motion, depth-aware positional encoding, and a flexible control signal for balancing precision and generative quality. This representation allows FlexAM to effectively disentangle appearance and motion, enabling a wide range of tasks including I2V/V2V editing, camera control, and spatial object editing.

To fit to the maximum context window constraint, current methods use keyframe sampling which can miss both macro-level events and micro-level details due to the sparse temporal coverage. Furthermore, processing full images and their tokens for each frame incurs substantial computational overhead. To address these limitations, we propose to leverage video codec primitives (specifically motion vectors and residuals) which natively encode video redundancy and sparsity without requiring expensive full-image encoding for most frames. To this end, we introduce lightweight transformer-based encoders that aggregate codec primitives and align their representations with image encoder embeddings through a pre-training strategy that accelerates convergence during end-to-end fine-tuning. Our approach reduces the time-to-first-token by up to $86\\%$ and token usage by up to $93\\%$ compared to standard VideoLMs. Moreover, by varying the keyframe and codec primitive densities we are able to maintain or exceed performance on $14$ diverse video understanding benchmarks spanning general question answering, temporal reasoning, long-form understanding, and spatial scene understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u57fa\u5143\uff08\u8fd0\u52a8\u5411\u91cf\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\uff09\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u89c6\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u65f6\u95f4\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u572814\u4e2a\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u7528\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u8986\u76d6\u4f1a\u9057\u6f0f\u5b8f\u89c2\u4e8b\u4ef6\u548c\u5fae\u89c2\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u5b8c\u6574\u56fe\u50cf\u53ca\u5176\u6807\u8bb0\u4f1a\u5e26\u6765\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u7f16\u7801\u89c6\u9891\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5bf9\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5e27\u8fdb\u884c\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u57fa\u5143\uff08\u8fd0\u52a8\u5411\u91cf\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\uff09\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6765\u805a\u5408\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u57fa\u5143\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5c06\u5176\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5d4c\u5165\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5728\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5fae\u8c03\u671f\u95f4\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\u3002", "result": "\u4e0e\u6807\u51c6\u89c6\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u9996\u4ee4\u724c\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe86%\uff0c\u4ee4\u724c\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe93%\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u6574\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u548c\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u57fa\u5143\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u572814\u4e2a\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u901a\u7528\u95ee\u7b54\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u957f\u5f62\u5f0f\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u57fa\u5143\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u6216\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, existing approaches often fall into the Pseudo-Equation Trap: producing equations that fit observations well but remain inconsistent with fundamental scientific principles. A key reason is that these approaches are dominated by empirical risk minimization, lacking explicit constraints to ensure scientific consistency. To bridge this gap, we propose PG-SR, a prior-guided SR framework built upon a three-stage pipeline consisting of warm-up, evolution, and refinement. Throughout the pipeline, PG-SR introduces a prior constraint checker that explicitly encodes domain priors as executable constraint programs, and employs a Prior Annealing Constrained Evaluation (PACE) mechanism during the evolution stage to progressively steer discovery toward scientifically consistent regions. Theoretically, we prove that PG-SR reduces the Rademacher complexity of the hypothesis space, yielding tighter generalization bounds and establishing a guarantee against pseudo-equations.

Sampling temperature directly controls the exploration--exploitation trade-off by modulating policy entropy, yet existing methods rely on static values or heuristic adaptations that are decoupled from task-level rewards. We propose Introspective LLM, a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that learns to control sampling temperature during generation.

To address these issues, we first propose a FCTN-based generalized nonconvex regularization paradigm from the perspective of gradient mapping. Then, reliable and scalable multi-dimensional data recovery models are investigated, where the model formulation is shifted from unquantized observations to coarse-grained quantized observations. Based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework, we derive efficient optimization algorithms with convergence guarantees to solve the formulated models. To alleviate the computational bottleneck encountered when processing large-scale multi-dimensional data, fast and efficient randomized compression algorithms are devised in virtue of sketching techniques in numerical linear algebra.

In this paper, we propose GMR (Geometric Manifold Rectification), a novel framework designed to robustly handle imbalanced structured data by exploiting local geometric priors.

Recent federated variants of GC have targeted distributed infrastructure applications (e.g., smart grids) with distributed clients that generate high-dimensional data bound by data-sovereignty constraints. However, Federated GC algorithms only yield deterministic point estimates of causality and neglect uncertainty. This paper establishes the first methodology for rigorously quantifying uncertainty and its propagation within federated GC frameworks. We systematically classify sources of uncertainty, explicitly differentiating aleatoric (data noise) from epistemic (model variability) effects. We derive closed-form recursions that model the evolution of uncertainty through client-server interactions and identify four novel cross-covariance components that couple data uncertainties with model parameter uncertainties across the federated architecture. We also define rigorous convergence conditions for these uncertainty recursions and obtain explicit steady-state variances for both server and client model parameters. Our convergence analysis demonstrates that steady-state variances depend exclusively on client data statistics, thus eliminating dependence on initial epistemic priors and enhancing robustness. Empirical evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that explicitly characterizing uncertainty significantly improves the reliability and interpretability of federated causal inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We collected group-level fMRI data from 20 advanced meditators to train the classifiers, and intensive single-case data from an advanced practitioner performing ACAM-J and control tasks to evaluate generalization. ReHo maps were computed, and features were extracted from predefined brain regions of interest. We trained multiple machine learning classifiers using stratified cross-validation to evaluate whether ReHo patterns distinguish ACAM-J from non-meditative states. Ensemble models achieved 66.82% (p < 0.05) accuracy in distinguishing ACAM-J from control conditions. Feature-importance analysis indicated that prefrontal and anterior cingulate areas contributed most to model decisions, aligning with established involvement of these regions in attentional regulation and metacognitive processes. Moreover, moderate agreement reflected in Cohen's kappa supports the feasibility of using machine learning to distinguish ACAM-J from non-meditative states.

However, such data are often difficult to obtain. Meanwhile, most existing trajectory generation methods implicitly assume that at least a subset of real mobility data from target city is available, which limits their applicability in data-inaccessible scenarios. In this work, we propose a new problem setting, called bus-conditioned zero-shot trajectory generation, where no mobility trajectories from a target city are accessible. The generation process relies solely on source city mobility data and publicly available bus timetables from both cities. Under this setting, we propose MobTA, the first approach to introduce task arithmetic into trajectory generation. MobTA models the parameter shift from bus-timetable-based trajectory generation to mobility trajectory generation in source city, and applies this shift to target city through arithmetic operations on task vectors. This enables trajectory generation that reflects target-city mobility patterns without requiring any real mobility data from it. Furthermore, we theoretically analyze MobTA's stability across base and instruction-tuned LLMs. Extensive experiments show that MobTA significantly outperforms existing methods, and achieves performance close to models finetuned using target city mobility trajectories.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While Explainable AI (XAI) techniques aim to make model decisions more transparent, their effectiveness is often hindered by the high dimensionality and noise present in raw time series data. In this work, we investigate whether transforming time series into discrete latent representations-using methods such as Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) and Discrete Variational Autoencoders (DVAE)-not only preserves but enhances explainability by reducing redundancy and focusing on the most informative patterns. We show that applying XAI methods to these compressed representations leads to concise and structured explanations that maintain faithfulness without sacrificing classification performance. Additionally, we propose Similar Subsequence Accuracy (SSA), a novel metric that quantitatively assesses the alignment between XAI-identified salient subsequences and the label distribution in the training data. SSA provides a systematic way to validate whether the features highlighted by XAI methods are truly representative of the learned classification patterns. Our findings demonstrate that discrete latent representations not only retain the essential characteristics needed for classification but also offer a pathway to more compact, interpretable, and computationally efficient explanations in time series analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u79bb\u6563\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff08\u5982VQ-VAE\u548cDVAE\uff09\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u538b\u7f29\u6570\u636e\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u4f7fXAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u7b80\u6d01\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SSA\u6307\u6807\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30XAI\u8bc6\u522b\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684XAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u7ef4\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u539f\u59cb\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528VQ-VAE\u548cDVAE\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u538b\u7f29\u8868\u793a\u4e0a\u5e94\u7528XAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u91ca\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807Similar Subsequence Accuracy (SSA)\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u91cf\u5316XAI\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5b50\u5e8f\u5217\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u79bb\u6563\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u6240\u9700\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7d27\u51d1\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684XAI\u89e3\u91ca\u3002SSA\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9a8c\u8bc1XAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u7a81\u51fa\u663e\u793a\u7684feature\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u79bb\u6563\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7684\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u4f7fXAI\u89e3\u91ca\u66f4\u52a0\u7b80\u6d01\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\uff0cSSA\u6307\u6807\u5219\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While lightweight architectures like MobileNet improve efficiency, they still demand thousands of parameters, limiting deployment on textile-integrated platforms. We introduce a convexified attention mechanism for wearable applications that dynamically weights features while preserving convexity through nonexpansive simplex projection and convex loss functions. Unlike conventional attention mechanisms using non-convex softmax operations, our approach employs Euclidean projection onto the probability simplex combined with multi-class hinge loss, ensuring global convergence guarantees. Implemented on a textile-based capacitive sensor with four connection points, our approach achieves 100.00\\% accuracy on tap gestures and 100.00\\% on swipe gestures -- consistent across 10-fold cross-validation and held-out test evaluation -- while requiring only 120--360 parameters, a 97\\% reduction compared to conventional approaches. With sub-millisecond inference times (290--296$\u03bc$s) and minimal storage requirements ($<$7KB), our method enables gesture interfaces directly within e-textiles without external processing. Our evaluation, conducted in controlled laboratory conditions with a single-user dataset, demonstrates feasibility for basic gesture interactions. Real-world deployment would require validation across multiple users, environmental conditions, and more complex gesture vocabularies.

However, the massive parameter scale and computational demands of LAIMs pose significant challenges for resource-limited embodied agents. To address this issue, we investigate quantization-aware collaborative inference (co-inference) for embodied AI systems. First, we develop a tractable approximation for quantization-induced inference distortion. Based on this approximation, we derive lower and upper bounds on the quantization rate-inference distortion function, characterizing its dependence on LAIM statistics, including the quantization bit-width. Next, we formulate a joint quantization bit-width and computation frequency design problem under delay and energy constraints, aiming to minimize the distortion upper bound while ensuring tightness through the corresponding lower bound. Extensive evaluations validate the proposed distortion approximation, the derived rate-distortion bounds, and the effectiveness of the proposed joint design. Particularly, simulations and real-world testbed experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed joint design in balancing inference quality, latency, and energy consumption in edge embodied AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9762\u5411\u5177\u8eabAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21AI\u6a21\u578b\u91cf\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u534f\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u8bf1\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u771f\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u7387\u5931\u771f\u8fb9\u754c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8054\u5408\u91cf\u5316\u6bd4\u7279\u5bbd\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u9891\u7387\u4f18\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5e73\u8861\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21AI\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5177\u8eabAI\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u667a\u80fd\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u5176\u5e9e\u5927\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u7ed9\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u534f\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u8bf1\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u771f\u7684\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\n2\uff09\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u7387\u5931\u771f\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u523b\u753b\u5176\u4e0eLAIM\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u6bd4\u7279\u5bbd\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\n3\uff09\u5728\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u80fd\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u8054\u5408\u91cf\u5316\u6bd4\u7279\u5bbd\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9891\u7387\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5931\u771f\u4e0a\u754c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u5e94\u4e0b\u754c\u786e\u4fdd\u7d27\u81f4\u6027", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8bc4\u4f30\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5931\u771f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u63a8\u5bfc\u7684\u7387\u5931\u771f\u8fb9\u754c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8054\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5747\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u8054\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u5177\u8eabAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u80fd\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5177\u8eabAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u534f\u540c\u63a8\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5927\u89c4\u6a21AI\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

We propose Memory-efficient Structured Backpropagation (MeSP), which bridges this gap by manually deriving backward passes that exploit LoRA's low-rank structure.

MeSP achieves 49\\% average memory reduction compared to MeBP on Qwen2.5 models (0.5B--3B) while computing mathematically identical gradients. Our analysis also reveals that MeZO's gradient estimates show near-zero correlation with true gradients (cosine similarity $\\approx$0.001), explaining its slow convergence.

However, most existing methods are designed for either homogeneous or heterogeneous graphs, thereby hindering unified graph modeling across diverse graph types.

In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that a balanced mixture of homogeneous and heterogeneous graph pre-training benefits downstream tasks and propose a unified multi-domain \\textbf{G}raph \\textbf{P}re-training method across \\textbf{H}omogeneous and \\textbf{H}eterogeneous graphs ($\\mathbf{GPH^{2}}$). To address the lack of a unified encoder for homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs, we propose a Unified Multi-View Graph Construction that simultaneously encodes both without explicit graph-type-specific designs. To cope with the increased cross-domain distribution discrepancies arising from mixed graphs, we introduce domain-specific expert encoding. Each expert is independently pre-trained on a single graph to capture domain-specific knowledge, thereby shielding the pre-training encoder from the adverse effects of cross-domain discrepancies.

However, existing frameworks like R-Zero often exhibit non-sustained improvement, where early gains degrade as self-play continues. We identify a key failure mode, Diversity Illusion, where the Solver's training signals appear diverse yet collapse into recurring underlying patterns. It manifests as (1) Local Diversity Illusion, where diversity is enforced only within-batch, inducing cross-iteration mode cycling; and (2) Surface Diversity Illusion, where questions vary superficially but require near-identical reasoning skills. To mitigate them, we propose R-Diverse with two aligned innovations: Memory-Augmented Penalty (MAP), which uses a persistent memory bank to discourage recycling across iterations, and Skill-Aware Measurement (SAM), which evaluates diversity by the reasoning skills exercised rather than surface variation of questions. Across 10 math and general reasoning benchmarks, R-Diverse sustains gains over more iterations and consistently outperforms prior self-play methods.

We address this gap with a key insight: atom ordering in neural representations matters. Building on this insight, we propose a structure-aware template-free framework that encodes the two-stage nature of chemical reactions as a positional inductive bias. By placing reaction center atoms at the sequence head, our method transforms implicit chemical knowledge into explicit positional patterns that the model can readily capture. The proposed RetroDiT backbone, a graph transformer with rotary position embeddings, exploits this ordering to prioritize chemically critical regions. Combined with discrete flow matching, our approach decouples training from sampling and enables generation in 20--50 steps versus 500 for prior diffusion methods. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both USPTO-50k (61.2% top-1) and the large-scale USPTO-Full (51.3% top-1) with predicted reaction centers. With oracle centers, performance reaches 71.1% and 63.4% respectively, surpassing foundation models trained on 10 billion reactions while using orders of magnitude less data.

We show that a missing principle is making GNN-MD IO-aware, carefully accounting for reads and writes between GPU high-bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. We present FlashSchNet, an efficient and accurate IO-aware SchNet-style GNN-MD framework built on four techniques: (1) flash radial basis, which fuses pairwise distance computation, Gaussian basis expansion, and cosine envelope into a single tiled pass, computing each distance once and reusing it across all basis functions; (2) flash message passing, which fuses cutoff, neighbor gather, filter multiplication, and reduction to avoid materializing edge tensors in HBM; (3) flash aggregation, which reformulates scatter-add via CSR segment reduce, reducing atomic writes by a factor of feature dimension and enabling contention-free accumulation in both forward and backward passes; (4) channel-wise 16-bit quantization that exploits the low per-channel dynamic range in SchNet MLP weights to further improve throughput with negligible accuracy loss. On a single NVIDIA RTX PRO 6000, FlashSchNet achieves 1000 ns/day aggregate simulation throughput over 64 parallel replicas on coarse-grained (CG) protein containing 269 beads (6.5x faster than CGSchNet baseline with 80% reduction of peak memory), surpassing classical force fields (e.g. MARTINI) while retaining SchNet-level accuracy and transferability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, aggressive low-bit PTQ can mask or erase unlearning updates, causing quantized models to revert to pre-unlearning behavior. We show that standard full-parameter fine-tuning often induce parameter changes that are too small to survive 4-bit quantization. We propose quantization-robust unlearning via low-rank adaptation (LoRA): we freeze the base model and concentrate unlearning into trainable adapters so that the effective update is preserved after quantization. On Llama-2-7B evaluated with MUSE dataset (BOOKS and NEWS), LoRA improves 4-bit utility by up to 7.93 points (NPO+GDR on BOOKS: 50.17 to 58.10) and yields higher 4-bit utility on NEWS for GA+GDR (40.06 to 44.82, increase of 4.76). LoRA also substantially reduces privacy leakage under 4-bit PTQ, e.g., for GA+KLR on BOOKS, PrivLeak moves from -25.68 to -5.86 (closer to ideal 0), while maintaining strong forgetting (VerMem and KnowMem near 0).

In contrast, classical approximation algorithms offer such performance guarantees under worst-case inputs but are non-differentiable and unable to adaptively exploit structural regularities in natural input distributions. We address this dichotomy with the fundamental example of Uniform Facility Location (UniFL), a variant of the combinatorial facility location problem with applications in clustering, data summarization, logistics, and supply chain design. We develop a fully differentiable MPNN model that embeds approximation-algorithmic principles while avoiding the need for solver supervision or discrete relaxations. Our approach admits provable approximation and size generalization guarantees to much larger instances than seen during training.
