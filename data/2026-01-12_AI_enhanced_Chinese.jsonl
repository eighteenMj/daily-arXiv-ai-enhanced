Attention maps describe where weight mass concentrates; they do not reveal whether queries and keys trade position, content, or both. We introduce Bi-orthogonal Factor Decomposition (BFD), a two-stage analytical framework: first, an ANOVA-based decomposition statistically disentangles token activations into orthogonal positional and content factors; second, SVD of the query-key interaction matrix QK^T exposes bi-orthogonal modes that reveal how these factors mediate communication. After validating proper isolation of position and content, we apply BFD to state-of-the-art vision models and uncover three phenomena.(i) Attention operates primarily through content. Content-content interactions dominate attention energy, followed by content-position coupling. DINOv2 allocates more energy to content-position than supervised models and distributes computation across a richer mode spectrum. (ii) Attention mechanisms exhibit specialization: heads differentiate into content-content, content-position, and position-position operators, while singular modes within heads show analogous specialization. (iii) DINOv2's superior holistic shape processing emerges from intermediate layers that simultaneously preserve positional structure while contextually enriching semantic content.\n  Overall, BFD exposes how tokens interact through attention and which informational factors - positional or semantic - mediate their communication, yielding practical insights into vision transformer mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Bi-orthogonal Factor Decomposition\uff08BFD\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u79bb\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u89c6\u89c9transformers\u4e2dtokens\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9transformer\u4e2d\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u952e\u5728\u4ea4\u4e92\u65f6\u4ea4\u6362\u7684\u662f\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u4fe1\u606f\u8fd8\u662f\u4e24\u8005\u517c\u6709\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u8026\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "method": "BFD\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8eANOVA\u7684\u5206\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e0a\u5206\u79bbtoken\u6fc0\u6d3b\u503c\u4e3a\u6b63\u4ea4\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u56e0\u5b50\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u56e0\u5b50\uff1b2\uff09\u67e5\u8be2-\u952e\u4ea4\u4e92\u77e9\u9635QK^T\u7684\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u5206\u89e3\u63ed\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u5b50\u5982\u4f55\u4ecb\u5bfc\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u53cc\u6b63\u4ea4\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u5206\u79bb\u540e\uff0c\u5e94\u7528BFD\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a1\uff09\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u5bb9\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5185\u5bb9-\u5185\u5bb9\u4ea4\u4e92\u5360\u4e3b\u5bfc\uff1b2\uff09\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u64cd\u4f5c\u5668\uff1b3\uff09DINOv2\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u5f62\u72b6\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u6e90\u81ea\u5176\u4fdd\u7559\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7ed3\u6784\u540c\u65f6\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u4e49\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u5c42\u3002", "conclusion": "BFD\u63ed\u793a\u4e86tokens\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4ea4\u4e92\u4ee5\u53ca\u54ea\u4e9b\u4fe1\u606f\u56e0\u7d20\uff08\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6216\u8bed\u4e49\uff09\u4ecb\u5bfc\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u89c6\u89c9transformer\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6d1e\u89c1\u3002"}}

Similarly, visual understanding can be viewed as the ability to construct a representative model of the system depicted in an image. This work explores the capacity of Vision Language Models (VLMs) to recognize and simulate the systems and mechanisms depicted in images using the Im2Sim methodology. The VLM is given a natural image of a real-world system (e.g., cities, clouds, vegetation) and is tasked with describing the system and writing code that simulates and generates it. This generative code is then executed to produce a synthetic image, which is compared against the original. This approach is tested on various complex emergent systems, ranging from physical systems (waves, lights, clouds) to vegetation, cities, materials, and geological formations. Through analysis of the models and images generated by the VLMs, we examine their understanding of the systems in images. The results show that leading VLMs (GPT, Gemini) demonstrate the capacity to understand and model complex, multi-component systems across multiple layers of abstraction and a wide range of domains. At the same time, the VLMs exhibit limited ability to replicate fine details and low-level arrangements of patterns in the image.

Monocular reconstruction is inherently ill-posed due to the lack of sufficient multiview constraints, making accurate recovery of object geometry and temporal coherence particularly challenging. To address this, we leverage multiple geometric cues, such as depth, optical flow, dynamic object segmentation, and point tracking. Combined with rigidity-based motion constraints, these cues allow us to estimate preliminary 3D scene dynamics during an initialization stage. Recovering scene dynamics prior to the photometric optimization reduces reliance on motion inference from visual appearance alone, which is often ambiguous in monocular settings. To enable compact representations, fast training, and real-time rendering while supporting non-rigid deformations, the scene is decomposed into static and dynamic components. Each Gaussian in the dynamic part of the scene is assigned a trajectory represented as time-dependent Poly-Fourier curve for parameter-efficient motion encoding. We demonstrate that MOSAIC-GS achieves substantially faster optimization and rendering compared to existing methods, while maintaining reconstruction quality on par with state-of-the-art approaches across standard monocular dynamic scene benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We derive two fundamental failure modes: (1) Entropy Decay, where finite sampling effects cause a monotonic loss of distributional diversity (mode collapse), and (2) Variance Amplification, where the loss of external grounding causes the model's representation of truth to drift as a random walk, bounded only by the support diameter. We show these behaviours are not contingent on architecture but are consequences of distributional learning on finite samples. We further argue that Reinforcement Learning with imperfect verifiers suffers similar semantic collapse. To overcome these limits, we propose a path involving symbolic regression and program synthesis guided by Algorithmic Probability. The Coding Theorem Method (CTM) allows for identifying generative mechanisms rather than mere correlations, escaping the data-processing inequality that binds standard statistical learning.

Given the potential Internet-wide adoption of BBR, we must also consider its robustness in network and system scenarios. One such scenario is Cloud-based Virtual Machine (VM) networking - highly relevant in today's CDN-centric Internet. Interestingly, previous work has shown significant performance problems of BBRv1-2 running in Xen VMs, with BBR performance dropping to almost zero when CPU credit is low. In this paper, we develop a framework for measuring TCP throughput under fully controlled CPU contention, which uses Linux deadline scheduling to emulate generalized CPU contention conditions. Our measurements reveal that - in stark contrast to Cubic! - BBR throughput can break down during CPU contention under any hypervisor and all tested BDP conditions. Characterizing this performance degradation on a fine-granular level, we show that CPU limited BBR senders are capped at very low throughput levels below 10-20 Mbps. This finding implies that an Internet-wide shift from Cubic to BBR could harm the Internet's overall robustness, if not deployed with caution. To detect and overcome CPU-limited throughput, we propose a minimal BBR patch which detects the problematic situation by monitoring inflight bytes and reacts by increasing the pacing rate to make better use of the available CPU time. We show that our BBR patch overcomes the throughput problem for the most critical cases.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Radiomics and deep learning (DL) have shown significant potential in assisting radiologists with early cancer detection. This paper aims to critically assess the performance of radiomics, DL, and ensemble techniques in detecting cancer from screening mammograms. Two independent datasets were used: the RSNA 2023 Breast Cancer Detection Challenge (11,913 patients) and a Mexican cohort from the TecSalud dataset (19,400 patients). The ConvNeXtV1-small DL model was trained on the RSNA dataset and validated on the TecSalud dataset, while radiomics models were developed using the TecSalud dataset and validated with a leave-one-year-out approach. The ensemble method consistently combined and calibrated predictions using the same methodology. Results showed that the ensemble approach achieved the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.87, compared to 0.83 for ConvNeXtV1-small and 0.80 for radiomics. In conclusion, ensemble methods combining DL and radiomics predictions significantly enhance breast cancer diagnosis from mammograms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We propose an intelligent spectrum control (ISC) scheme that combines high-accuracy spectrum sensing with AI-assisted real-time decision-making to generate time-frequency dynamic occupation patterns for multiple legitimate users. The scheme can proactively avoid external interference and intra-system co-channel collisions, thereby improving covertness and reliability. Within this framework, we derive closed-form expressions for the detection error probability (DEP) of the eavesdropper and the reliable transmission probability (RTP) of legitimate users under multi-user joint detection. We then analytically optimize the transmission power that can maximize the covert rate (CR), as well as the maximum number of users that can access the system covertly and concurrently under given covertness and reliability constraints. Simulation results confirm the tight match between the analytical and Monte Carlo curves, and show that the proposed scheme can achieve a higher DEP, a larger RTP, and a greater multi-user capacity than the benchmark scheme.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u667a\u80fd\u9891\u8c31\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u5c0f\u533a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u591a\u7528\u6237\u9690\u853d\u901a\u4fe1\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9891\u8c31\u611f\u77e5\u548cAI\u8f85\u52a9\u5b9e\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4f18\u5316\u4f20\u8f93\u529f\u7387\u548c\u7528\u6237\u63a5\u5165\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u9690\u853d\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u591a\u5c0f\u533a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7a83\u542c\u8005\u548c\u6076\u610f\u5e72\u6270\u8005\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u9690\u853d\u901a\u4fe1\u65b9\u6848\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5e94\u5bf9\u5916\u90e8\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5185\u540c\u9891\u78b0\u649e\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u63d0\u9ad8\u9690\u853d\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u9690\u853d\u6027\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u52a8\u6001\u7ba1\u7406\u9891\u8c31\u8d44\u6e90\u5e76\u667a\u80fd\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u667a\u80fd\u9891\u8c31\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u9891\u8c31\u611f\u77e5\u548cAI\u8f85\u52a9\u5b9e\u65f6\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u7528\u6237\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u9891\u52a8\u6001\u5360\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u53ef\u4e3b\u52a8\u907f\u514d\u5916\u90e8\u5e72\u6270\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5185\u540c\u9891\u78b0\u649e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u5bfc\u7a83\u542c\u8005\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u6982\u7387\u548c\u5408\u6cd5\u7528\u6237\u53ef\u9760\u4f20\u8f93\u6982\u7387\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u9690\u853d\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4f18\u5316\u4f20\u8f93\u529f\u7387\u53ca\u6700\u5927\u5e76\u53d1\u7528\u6237\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u66f2\u7ebf\u9ad8\u5ea6\u543b\u5408\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6848\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u9519\u8bef\u6982\u7387\u3001\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u4f20\u8f93\u6982\u7387\u4ee5\u53ca\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u591a\u7528\u6237\u5bb9\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u667a\u80fd\u9891\u8c31\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u7528\u6237\u9690\u853d\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5e72\u6270\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u9690\u853d\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4f18\u5316\u7ed3\u679c\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

See https://github.com/The-Coherence-Initiative/TIME and https://github.com/The-Coherence-Initiative/TIMEBench for associated code", "summary": "Reasoning oriented large language models often expose explicit \"thinking\" as long, turn-global traces at the start of every response, either always on or toggled externally at inference time. While useful for arithmetic, programming, and problem solving, this design is costly, blurs claim level auditability, and cannot re-trigger explicit reasoning once the model begins presenting. Dialogue models are also largely blind to temporal structure, treating replies after seconds and replies after weeks as equivalent unless time is stated in text. We introduce TIME, the Temporally Intelligent Meta-reasoning Engine, a behavioral alignment framework that treats explicit reasoning as a context sensitive resource driven by discourse and temporal cues. TIME augments dialogue with optional ISO 8601 <time> tags, tick turns that represent silent gaps, and short <think> blocks that can appear anywhere in a reply. A four-phase curriculum including a small, maximally diverse full-batch alignment step trains Qwen3 dense models to invoke brief, in-place reasoning bursts and keep user facing text compact.

In this study, we propose an ontology-guided, equation-centric framework that tightly integrates large language models (LLMs) with an additive manufacturing mathematical knowledge graph (AM-MKG) to enable reliable knowledge extraction and principled extrapolative modeling. By explicitly encoding equations, variables, assumptions, and their semantic relationships within a formal ontology, unstructured literature is transformed into machine-interpretable representations that support structured querying and reasoning. LLM-based equation generation is further conditioned on MKG-derived subgraphs, enforcing physically meaningful functional forms and mitigating non-physical or unstable extrapolation trends. To assess reliability beyond conventional predictive uncertainty, a confidence-aware extrapolation assessment is introduced, integrating extrapolation distance, statistical stability, and knowledge-graph-based physical consistency into a unified confidence score. Results demonstrate that ontology-guided extraction significantly improves the structural coherence and quantitative reliability of extracted knowledge, while subgraph-conditioned equation generation yields stable and physically consistent extrapolations compared to unguided LLM outputs.

However, the inherent susceptibility of mmWave frequencies to weather-related attenuation, particularly rain fading, complicates the maintenance of stringent Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. This creates a critical challenge: making admission decisions under uncertainty regarding future network capacity. To address this, we develop a proactive slice admission control framework for mmWave x-haul networks subject to rain-induced fluctuations. Our objective is to improve network performance, ensure QoS, and optimize revenue, thereby surpassing the limitations of standard reactive approaches. The proposed framework integrates a deep learning predictor of future network conditions with a proactive Q-learning-based slice admission control mechanism. We validate our solution using real-world data from a mmWave x-haul deployment in a dense urban area, incorporating realistic models of link capacity attenuation and dynamic slice demands. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our proactive solution achieves 2-3x higher long-term average revenue under dynamic link conditions, providing a scalable and resilient framework for adaptive admission control.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While quaternion neural networks improve parameter efficiency by coupling multiple channels through Hamilton products, they typically retain unstructured dense weights; conversely, structured matrices enable fast computation but are usually applied in the real domain. This paper introduces EdgeLDR, a practical framework for quaternion block-circulant linear and convolutional layers that combines quaternion channel mixing with block-circulant parameter structure and enables FFT-based evaluation through the complex adjoint representation. We present reference implementations of EdgeLDR layers and compare FFT-based computation against a naive spatial-domain realization of quaternion circulant products. FFT evaluation yields large empirical speedups over the naive implementation and keeps latency stable as block size increases, making larger compression factors computationally viable. We further integrate EdgeLDR layers into compact CNN and Transformer backbones and evaluate accuracy-compression trade-offs on 32x32 RGB classification (CIFAR-10/100, SVHN) and hyperspectral image classification (Houston 2013, Pavia University), reporting parameter counts and CPU/GPU latency.

For multi-antenna systems, receiver-transparent MOC schemes are proposed, including series-expansion-based and constellation-path-based signal designs, and are further extended to RIS-assisted systems with joint beamformer and RIS reflection design.

Although recent studies suggest that assigning personality traits to LLMs can influence their behavior, how personality steering affects cooperation under controlled conditions remains unclear. In this study, we examine the effects of personality steering on cooperative behavior in LLM agents using repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games. Based on the Big Five framework, we first measure basic personality profiles of three models, GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4o, and GPT-5, using the Big Five Inventory. We then compare behavior under baseline and personality-informed conditions, and further analyze the effects of independently manipulating each personality dimension to extreme values. Our results show that agreeableness is the dominant factor promoting cooperation across all models, while other personality traits have limited impact.

While FL offers notable advantages, it faces critical challenges in ensuring fairness across diverse demographic groups. To address these fairness concerns, various fairness-aware debiasing methods have been proposed. However, many of these approaches either require modifications to clients' training protocols or lack flexibility in their aggregation strategies. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing EquFL, a novel server-side debiasing method designed to mitigate bias in FL systems. EquFL operates by allowing the server to generate a single calibrated update after receiving model updates from the clients. This calibrated update is then integrated with the aggregated client updates to produce an adjusted global model that reduces bias. Theoretically, we establish that EquFL converges to the optimal global model achieved by FedAvg and effectively reduces fairness loss over training rounds. Empirically, we demonstrate that EquFL significantly mitigates bias within the system, showcasing its practical effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While existing methods could leverage databases of expert-curated enzyme-substrate pairs for models to learn from known pair interactions, the databases are often sparse, i.e., there are only limited and incomplete examples of such pairs, and also labor-intensive to maintain. This lack of sufficient training data significantly hinders the ability of traditional enzyme prediction models to generalize to unseen interactions. In this work, we try to exploit chemical reaction equations from domain-specific databases, given their easier accessibility and denser, more abundant data. However, interactions of multiple compounds, e.g., educts and products, with the same enzymes create complex relational data patterns that traditional models cannot easily capture. To tackle that, we represent chemical reaction equations as triples of (educt, enzyme, product) within a knowledge graph, such that we can take advantage of knowledge graph embedding (KGE) to infer missing enzyme-substrate pairs for graph completion. Particularly, in order to capture intricate relationships among compounds, we propose our knowledge-enhanced hypergraph model for enzyme prediction, i.e., Hyper-Enz, which integrates a hypergraph transformer with a KGE model to learn representations of the hyper-edges that involve multiple educts and products. Also, a multi-expert paradigm is introduced to guide the learning of enzyme-substrate interactions with both the proposed model and chemical reaction equations. Experimental results show a significant improvement, with up to a 88% relative improvement in average enzyme retrieval accuracy and 30% improvement in pair-level prediction compared to traditional models, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This allows the informed selection of suitable control strategies without explicit model identification. We provide data-based conditions characterizing the (vector) relative degree and the stability of the zero dynamics, which are critical for ensuring proper performance of modern controllers. Our results cover both single- and multi-input/output settings of discrete-time linear systems. We further show how a continuous-time system can be reconstructed from three sampling discretizations obtained via Zero-order Hold at suitable sampling times, thus allowing the extension of the results to the combined data collected from these discretizations.

To address this shortcoming, we propose a multi-task learning framework to fine-tune BiomedCLIP and evaluate improvements to CXR image-text retrieval. Using BiomedCLIP as the backbone, we incorporate a lightweight MLP projector head trained with a multi-task composite loss function that includes: (1) a binary cross-entropy loss to distinguish normal from abnormal CXR studies, (2) a supervised contrastive loss to reinforce intra-class consistency, and (3) a CLIP loss to maintain cross-modal alignment.

However, current forecasting models treat blood glucose readings captured using CGMs as a numerical sequence, either ignoring context or relying on additional sensors/modalities that are difficult to collect and deploy at scale. Recently, LLMs have shown promise for time-series forecasting tasks, yet their role as agentic context extractors in diabetes care remains largely unexplored. To address these limitations, we propose GlyRAG, a context-aware, retrieval-augmented forecasting framework that derives semantic understanding of blood glucose dynamics directly from CGM traces without requiring additional sensor modalities. GlyRAG employs an LLM as a contextualization agent to generate clinical summaries. These summaries are embedded by a language model and fused with patch-based glucose representations in a multimodal transformer architecture with a cross translation loss aligining textual and physiological embeddings. A retrieval module then identifies similar historical episodes in the learned embedding space and uses cross-attention to integrate these case-based analogues prior to making a forecasting inference. Extensive evaluations on two T1D cohorts show that GlyRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the art methods, achieving up to 39% lower RMSE and a further 1.7% reduction in RMSE over the baseline. Clinical evaluation shows that GlyRAG places 85% predictions in safe zones and achieves 51% improvement in predicting dysglycemic events across both cohorts. These results indicate that LLM-based contextualization and retrieval over CGM traces can enhance the accuracy and clinical reliability of long-horizon glucose forecasting without the need for extra sensors, thus supporting future agentic decision-support tools for diabetes management.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The main contribution of this article is a 3-satellite experimental demonstration of decentralized closed-loop EMFF using AMFF. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of AMFF with at least 3 satellites in open or closed loop. This is noteworthy because the coupling challenges of EMFF are only present with more than 2 satellites, and thus, a formation of at least 3 is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of AMFF.

The European Union is among several regions that have implemented emissions pricing through an Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). While the EU ETS has contributed to emissions reductions, it has also raised concerns related to international competitiveness and carbon leakage, particularly given the strong integration of EU industries into global value chains. To address these challenges, the European Commission proposed the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) in 2021. CBAM is designed to operate alongside the EU ETS by applying a carbon price to selected imported goods, thereby aligning carbon costs between domestic and foreign producers.

Twin neural network regression is naturally capable of incorporating these properties to invert non-injective functions.

A central but underexplored aspect of IL in this context is the role of the \\emph{expert} that generates training demonstrations. Existing studies employ a wide range of expert constructions, yet lack a unifying framework to characterise their modelling assumptions, computational properties, and impact on learning performance.\n  This paper introduces a systematic taxonomy of experts for IL in combinatorial optimisation under uncertainty. Experts are classified along three dimensions: (i) their treatment of uncertainty, including myopic, deterministic, full-information, two-stage stochastic, and multi-stage stochastic formulations; (ii) their level of optimality, distinguishing task-optimal and approximate experts; and (iii) their interaction mode with the learner, ranging from one-shot supervision to iterative, interactive schemes. Building on this taxonomy, we propose a generalised Dataset Aggregation (DAgger) algorithm that supports multiple expert queries, expert aggregation, and flexible interaction strategies.\n  The proposed framework is evaluated on a dynamic physician-to-patient assignment problem with stochastic arrivals and capacity constraints.

However, their adoption in high-stakes environments is hindered by their opacity; their outputs lack faithful explanations and cannot be effectively contested to correct errors, undermining trustworthiness. In this paper, we propose ART (Adaptive Reasoning Trees), a hierarchical method for claim verification. The process begins with a root claim, which branches into supporting and attacking child arguments. An argument's strength is determined bottom-up via a pairwise tournament of its children, adjudicated by a judge LLM, allowing a final, transparent and contestable verdict to be systematically derived which is missing in methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT). We empirically validate ART on multiple datasets, analyzing different argument generators and comparison strategies.

In particular, it addresses the challenge of maintaining finite/fixed-time stability of nonlinear systems in the presence of quantized measurements. To analyze the behavior of quantized control system, we introduce a new type of discrete homogeneity, where the dilation is defined by a discrete group. The converse Lyapunov function theorem is established for homogeneous systems with respect to discrete dilations. By extending the notion of sector-boundedness to a homogeneous vector space, we derive a generalized homogeneous sector-boundedness condition that guarantees finite/fixed-time stability of nonlinear control system under quantized measurements. A geometry-aware homogeneous static vector quantizer is then designed using generalized homogeneous coordinates, enabling an efficient quantization scheme. The resulting homogeneous control system with the proposed quantizer is proven to be homogeneous with respect to discrete dilation and globally finite-time, nearly fixed-time, or exponentially stable, depending on the homogeneity degree.

However, accurate imaging of roots in subterranean environments remains a persistent challenge due to adverse conditions such as occlusion, varying soil moisture, and inherently low contrast, which limit the effectiveness of conventional vision-based approaches. In this work, we propose a novel underground imaging system that captures multiple overlapping views of plant roots and integrates a deep learning-based Multi-Image Super Resolution (MISR) framework designed to enhance root visibility and detail. To train and evaluate our approach, we construct a synthetic dataset that simulates realistic underground imaging scenarios, incorporating key environmental factors that affect image quality. Our proposed MISR algorithm leverages spatial redundancy across views to reconstruct high-resolution images with improved structural fidelity and visual clarity. Quantitative evaluations show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art super resolution baselines, achieving a 2.3 percent reduction in BRISQUE, indicating improved image quality with the same CLIP-IQA score, thereby enabling enhanced phenotypic analysis of root systems. This, in turn, facilitates accurate estimation of critical root traits, including root hair count and root hair density. The proposed framework presents a promising direction for robust automatic underground plant root imaging and trait quantification for agricultural and ecological research.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this study, CAT12/SPM12 voxel-based morphometry was applied to baseline T1-weighted MRI scans from 249 ADNI participants (CN = 90, MCI = 129, AD = 30). Gray matter volume was analyzed using a general linear model, with the diagnostic group as primary predictor and age and total intracranial volume as covariates. Statistical maps were thresholded at p < 0.001 (voxelwise) and corrected for multiple comparisons at the cluster level using family-wise error (FWE) correction (p < 0.05). Significant hippocampal atrophy was observed in AD relative to CN and MCI (Cohen's d = 2.03 and 1.61, respectively). Hippocampal volume demonstrated moderate predictive value for conversion from MCI to AD (AUC = 0.66).

To address these limitations, we propose HINT (Hierarchical INteractive Teacher-based transfer), a novel KD framework for MARL in a centralized training, decentralized execution setup. By leveraging hierarchical RL, HINT provides a scalable, high-performing teacher. Our key innovation, pseudo off-policy RL, enables the teacher policy to be updated using both teacher and student experience, thereby improving OOD adaptation. HINT also applies performance-based filtering to retain only outcome-relevant guidance, reducing observation mismatches.

Direct encoding of such videos is computationally too expensive, while simple video-to-text conversion often results in redundant or fragmented content. To address these limitations, we introduce MMViR, a novel multi-modal, multi-grained structured representation for long video understanding. MMViR identifies key turning points to segment the video and constructs a three-level description that couples global narratives with fine-grained visual details. This design supports efficient query-based retrieval and generalizes well across various scenarios. Extensive evaluations across three tasks, including QA, summarization, and retrieval, show that MMViR outperforms the prior strongest method, achieving a 19.67% improvement in hour-long video understanding while reducing processing latency to 45.4% of the original.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Two main approaches have recently been proposed to address this issue: (i) direct measurementerror correction based on misclassification models such as Rogan-Gladen-style estimators, and (ii) surrogate-outcome approaches such as prediction-powered inference (PPI), which correct bias by calibrating prediction residuals on a small set of gold-standard human labels. In this paper, we systematically study the performance of these two approaches for estimating mean parameters (e.g., average benchmark scores or pairwise win rates). Leveraging tools from semiparametric efficiency theory, we unify the two classes of estimators by deriving explicit forms of efficient influence function (EIF)-based efficient estimators and characterize conditions under which PPI-style estimators attain strictly smaller asymptotic variance than measurement-error corrections. We verify our theoretical results in simulations and demonstrate the methods on real-data examples.

This ambiguity is particularly consequential in medicine where uncertainty is pervasive. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic paradigm to theoretically explain how high certainty in ground truth answers is almost always necessary for even an expert to achieve high scores, whereas in datasets with high variation in ground truth answers there may be little difference between a random labeller and an expert. Therefore, ignoring uncertainty in ground truth evaluation data can result in the misleading conclusion that a non-expert has similar performance to that of an expert. Using the probabilistic paradigm, we thus bring forth the concepts of expected accuracy and expected F1 to estimate the score an expert human or system can achieve given ground truth answer variability.\n  Our work leads to the recommendation that when establishing the capability of a system, results should be stratified by probability of the ground truth answer, typically measured by the agreement rate of ground truth experts. Stratification becomes critical when the overall performance drops below a threshold of 80%. Under stratified evaluation, performance comparison becomes more reliable in high certainty bins, mitigating the effect of the key confounding factor -- uncertainty.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The classification branch is enhanced via mask-guided attention, allowing the model to focus on lesion-relevant features while suppressing background artifacts. Experiments on the PRECISE 2025 breast ultrasound dataset, split per class into 80 percent training and 20 percent testing, show that the proposed method achieves a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 0.887 and an accuracy of 92.3 percent, ranking among the top entries on the PRECISE challenge leaderboard.

Conventional model-based history matching methods, which entail the generation of posterior geomodels calibrated to observed data, can be challenging to apply in coupled flow-geomechanics problems with faults. In this work, we implement a variational autoencoder (VAE)-based data-space inversion (DSI) framework to predict pressure, stress and strain fields, and fault slip tendency, in CO${_2}$ storage projects. The main computations required by the DSI workflow entail the simulation of O(1000) prior geomodels. The posterior distributions for quantities of interest are then inferred directly from prior simulation results and observed data, without the need to generate posterior geomodels. The model used here involves a synthetic 3D system with two faults. Realizations of heterogeneous permeability and porosity fields are generated using geostatistical software, and uncertain geomechanical and fault parameters are sampled for each realization from prior distributions. Coupled flow-geomechanics simulations for these geomodels are conducted using GEOS. A VAE with stacked convolutional long short-term memory layers is trained, using the prior simulation results, to represent pressure, strain, effective normal stress and shear stress fields in terms of latent variables.

As Large Language Models (LLMs) become integral to robotics decision-making, the physical dimension of risk grows; a single wrong instruction can directly endanger human safety. This paper addresses the urgent need to systematically evaluate LLM performance in scenarios where even minor errors are catastrophic. Through a qualitative evaluation of a fire evacuation scenario, we identified critical failure cases in LLM-based decision-making. Based on these, we designed seven tasks for quantitative assessment, categorized into: Complete Information, Incomplete Information, and Safety-Oriented Spatial Reasoning (SOSR). Complete information tasks utilize ASCII maps to minimize interpretation ambiguity and isolate spatial reasoning from visual processing. Incomplete information tasks require models to infer missing context, testing for spatial continuity versus hallucinations. SOSR tasks use natural language to evaluate safe decision-making in life-threatening contexts. We benchmark various LLMs and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) across these tasks. Beyond aggregate performance, we analyze the implications of a 1% failure rate, highlighting how \"rare\" errors escalate into catastrophic outcomes. Results reveal serious vulnerabilities: several models achieved a 0% success rate in ASCII navigation, while in a simulated fire drill, models instructed robots to move toward hazardous areas instead of emergency exits. Our findings lead to a sobering conclusion: current LLMs are not ready for direct deployment in safety-critical systems. A 99% accuracy rate is dangerously misleading in robotics, as it implies one out of every hundred executions could result in catastrophic harm. We demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models cannot guarantee safety, and absolute reliance on them creates unacceptable risks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To bridge this gap, we address the problem of adaptive sensor selection for a data-gathering UAV, considering both the buffered data at each sensor and realistic propagation conditions. We introduce the Hover-based Greedy Adaptive Download (HGAD) strategy, designed to maximize data transfer by intelligently hovering over sensors during periods of peak signal quality. We validate HGAD using both a digital twin (DT) and a real-world (RW) testbed at the NSF-funded AERPAW platform. Our experiments show that HGAD significantly improves download stability and successfully meets per-sensor data targets. When compared with the traditional Greedy approach that simply follows the strongest signal, HGAD is shown to outperform in the cumulative data download.

Our work introduces a paradigm shift from conventional pixel-based video generation to the creation of high-fidelity avatar with swapped faces. The framework first preprocesses target video to extract FLAME parameters, camera poses and segmentation masks, and then rigs 3D Gaussian splats to the FLAME model across frames, enabling dynamic facial control. To ensure identity preserving, we propose an compound identity embedding constructed from three state-of-the-art face recognition models for avatar finetuning.

However, when applied to high-dimensional data or data with latent confounders, these methods, often based on off-the-shelf continuous optimization algorithms, struggle with the vast search space, the complexity of the objective function, and the nontrivial nature of graph-theoretical constraints. As a result, there has been a surge of interest in leveraging super-structures to guide the optimization process. Nonetheless, learning an appropriate super-structure at the right level of granularity, and doing so efficiently across various settings, presents significant challenges.\n  In this paper, we propose ALVGL, a novel and general enhancement to the differentiable causal discovery pipeline. ALVGL employs a sparse and low-rank decomposition to learn the precision matrix of the data. We design an ADMM procedure to optimize this decomposition, identifying components in the precision matrix that are most relevant to the underlying causal structure. These components are then combined to construct a super-structure that is provably a superset of the true causal graph. This super-structure is used to initialize a standard differentiable causal discovery method with a more focused search space, thereby improving both optimization efficiency and accuracy.\n  We demonstrate the versatility of ALVGL by instantiating it across a range of structural causal models, including both Gaussian and non-Gaussian settings, with and without unmeasured confounders. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that ALVGL not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but also significantly improves optimization efficiency, making it a reliable and effective solution for differentiable causal discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address these challenges, we introduce WildSci, a new dataset of domain-specific science questions automatically synthesized from peer-reviewed literature, covering 9 scientific disciplines and 26 subdomains. By framing complex scientific reasoning tasks in a multiple-choice format, we enable scalable training with well-defined reward signals.

Yet, while controlled generation methods from prompting to fine-tuning proliferate, a fundamental question remains unanswered: are these models truly controllable in the first place? In this work, we provide a theoretical framework to formally answer this question. Framing human-model interaction as a control process, we propose a novel algorithm to estimate the controllable sets of models in a dialogue setting. Notably, we provide formal guarantees on the estimation error as a function of sample complexity: we derive probably-approximately correct bounds for controllable set estimates that are distribution-free, employ no assumptions except for output boundedness, and work for any black-box nonlinear control system (i.e., any generative model). We empirically demonstrate the theoretical framework on different tasks in controlling dialogue processes, for both language models and text-to-image generation. Our results show that model controllability is surprisingly fragile and highly dependent on the experimental setting. This highlights the need for rigorous controllability analysis, shifting the focus from simply attempting control to first understanding its fundamental limits.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

At extreme far distances, VPReID is highly challenging due to severe resolution degradation, drastic viewpoint variation and inevitable appearance noise.

First, we deploy a Memory-Enhanced Visual Backbone (MEVB) to extract discriminative feature representations, which leverages the CLIP vision encoder and multi-proxy memory. Second, we propose a Multi-Granularity Temporal Modeling (MGTM) to construct sequences at multiple temporal granularities and adaptively emphasize motion cues across scales. Third, we incorporate Prior-Regularized Shape Dynamics (PRSD) to capture body structure dynamics. With these modules, our framework can obtain more discriminative feature representations.

In this work, we explore inference-time search algorithms that guide the LLM to discover better solutions through iterative refinement based on execution feedback. Our approach, called MaxCode unifies existing search methods under a max-reward reinforcement learning framework, making the observation and action-value functions modular for modification. To enhance the observation space, we integrate a natural language critique model that converts raw execution feedback into diagnostic insights about errors and performance bottlenecks, and the best-discounted reward seen so far. Together, these provide richer input to the code proposal function. To improve exploration during search, we train a generative reward-to-go model using action values from rollouts to rerank potential solutions.

To overcome these challenges, we propose DIFF-MF, a novel difference-driven channel-spatial state space model for multi-modal image fusion. Our approach leverages feature discrepancy maps between modalities to guide feature extraction, followed by a fusion process across both channel and spatial dimensions. In the channel dimension, a channel-exchange module enhances channel-wise interaction through cross-attention dual state space modeling, enabling adaptive feature reweighting. In the spatial dimension, a spatial-exchange module employs cross-modal state space scanning to achieve comprehensive spatial fusion. By efficiently capturing global dependencies while maintaining linear computational complexity, DIFF-MF effectively integrates complementary multi-modal features.

Conversely, zeroth-order (ZO) methods offer stronger exploratory behavior without relying on explicit gradients, yet suffer from slow convergence.

To address these challenges, we propose \\textbf{Hi-ZFO} (\\textbf{Hi}erarchical \\textbf{Z}eroth- and \\textbf{F}irst-\\textbf{O}rder optimization), a hybrid framework designed to synergize the precision of FO gradients with the exploratory capability of ZO estimation. Hi-ZFO adaptively partitions the model through layer-wise importance profiling, applying precise FO updates to critical layers while leveraging ZO optimization for less sensitive ones. Notably, ZO in Hi-ZFO is not merely a memory-saving surrogate; it is intentionally introduced as a source of \"beneficial stochasticity\" to help the model escape the local minima where pure FO optimization tends to stagnate.

However, despite their theoretical promise, the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to fraud detection in real-world financial contexts remains largely unexploited, and their practical effectiveness in handling domain-specific e-commerce transaction data has yet to be empirically validated. To bridge this gap between conventional machine learning limitations and the untapped potential of LLMs in fraud detection, this paper proposes a novel approach that employs Reinforcement Learning (RL) to post-train lightweight language models specifically for fraud detection tasks using only raw transaction data. We utilize the Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) algorithm combined with a rule-based reward system to fine-tune language models of various sizes on a real-life transaction dataset provided by a Chinese global payment solution company. Through this reinforcement learning framework, the language models are encouraged to explore diverse trust and risk signals embedded within the textual transaction data, including patterns in customer information, shipping details, product descriptions, and order history. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, with post-trained language models achieving substantial F1-score improvements on held-out test data.

To mitigate this limitation, mainstream approaches typically rely on external control signals to explicitly constrain the spatial layout, local semantic and visual attributes of images. However, this strong dependency makes the input format rigid, rendering it incompatible with the heterogeneous resource conditions of users and diverse constraint requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MoGen, a user-friendly multi-object image generation method. First, we design a Regional Semantic Anchor (RSA) module that precisely anchors phrase units in language descriptions to their corresponding image regions during the generation process, enabling text-to-image generation that follows quantity specifications for multiple objects. Building upon this foundation, we further introduce an Adaptive Multi-modal Guidance (AMG) module, which adaptively parses and integrates various combinations of multi-source control signals to formulate corresponding structured intent. This intent subsequently guides selective constraints on scene layouts and object attributes, achieving dynamic fine-grained control. Experimental results demonstrate that MoGen significantly outperforms existing methods in generation quality, quantity consistency, and fine-grained control, while exhibiting superior accessibility and control flexibility.

In this work, we conduct a systematic evaluation of over-searching across multiple dimensions, including query types, model categories, retrieval conditions, and multi-turn conversations. Our finding shows: (i) search generally improves answer accuracy on answerable queries but harms abstention on unanswerable ones; (ii) over-searching is more pronounced in complex reasoning models and deep research systems, is exacerbated by noisy retrieval, and compounds across turns in multi-turn conversations; and (iii) the composition of retrieved evidence is crucial, as the presence of negative evidence improves abstention. To quantify over-searching, we introduce Tokens Per Correctness (TPC), an evaluation metric that captures the performance-cost trade-off for search-augmented LLMs. Lastly, we investigate mitigation approaches at both the query and retrieval levels and release the OverSearchQA to foster continued research into efficient search-augmented LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, click data is heavily biased, i.e., users tend to click higher-ranked items (position bias), choose only what was shown to them (selection bias), and trust top results more (trust bias). Without explicitly modeling these biases, the true relevance of ranked items cannot be correctly learned from clicks. Existing Unbiased Learning-to-Rank (ULTR) methods mainly correct position bias and rely on propensity estimation, but they cannot measure remaining bias, provide risk guarantees, or jointly handle multiple bias sources. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces a novel causal learning-based ranking framework that extends ULTR by combining Structural Causal Models (SCMs) with information-theoretic tools. SCMs specify how clicks are generated and help identify the true relevance signal from click data, while conditional mutual information, measures how much bias leaks into the\n  learned relevance estimates. We use this leakage measure to define a rigorous notion of disentanglement and include it as a regularizer during model training to reduce bias. In addition, we incorporate a causal inference estimator, i.e., doubly robust estimator, to ensure more reliable risk estimation. Experiments on standard Learning-to-Rank benchmarks show that our method consistently reduces measured bias leakage and improves ranking performance, especially in realistic scenarios where multiple biases-such as position and trust bias-interact strongly.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this, we propose VIB-Probe, a novel hallucination detection and mitigation framework leveraging the Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) theory. Our method extracts discriminative patterns across layers and heads while filtering out semantic nuisances through the information bottleneck principle. Furthermore, by leveraging the gradients of our VIB probe, we identify attention heads with strong causal influence on hallucinations and introduce an inference-time intervention strategy for hallucination mitigation.

These intrinsic data properties, combined with fragmented governance and incompatible reporting standards, have long hindered the creation of an integrated, cross-city accident prevention framework. To address this gap, we propose the Mamba Local-ttention Spatial-Temporal Network MLA-STNet, a unified system that formulates accident risk prediction as a multi-task learning problem across multiple cities. MLA-STNet integrates two complementary modules: (i)the Spatio-Temporal Geographical Mamba-Attention (STG-MA), which suppresses unstable spatio-temporal fluctuations and strengthens long-range temporal dependencies; and (ii) the Spatio-Temporal Semantic Mamba-Attention (STS-MA), which mitigates cross-city heterogeneity through a shared-parameter design that jointly trains all cities while preserving individual semantic representation spaces. We validate the proposed framework through 75 experiments under two forecasting scenarios, full-day and high-frequency accident periods, using real-world datasets from New York City and Chicago. Compared with the state-of-the-art baselines, MLA-STNet achieves up to 6% lower RMSE, 8% higher Recall, and 5% higher MAP, while maintaining less than 1% performance variation under 50% input noise. These results demonstrate that MLA-STNet effectively unifies heterogeneous urban datasets within a scalable, robust, and interpretable Cross-City Accident Prevention System, paving the way for coordinated and data-driven urban safety management.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Inductive KGC methods can handle the emerging entities and relations in KGs, offering greater dynamic adaptability. While existing inductive KGC methods have achieved some success, they also face challenges, such as susceptibility to noisy structural information during reasoning and difficulty in capturing long-range dependencies in reasoning paths. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Cumulative Path-Level Semantic Reasoning for inductive knowledge graph completion (CPSR) framework, which simultaneously captures both the structural and semantic information of KGs to enhance the inductive KGC task. Specifically, the proposed CPSR employs a query-dependent masking module to adaptively mask noisy structural information while retaining important information closely related to the targets. Additionally, CPSR introduces a global semantic scoring module that evaluates both the individual contributions and the collective impact of nodes along the reasoning path within KGs.

We have witnessed significant progress in widely use of visual-language foundational models in recent approaches. However, current methods often struggle with complex prompt engineering, elaborate adaptation modules, and challenging training strategies, ultimately limiting their flexibility and generality. To address these issues, this paper rethinks the fundamental mechanism behind visual-language models for AD and presents an embarrassingly simple, general, and effective framework for Universal vision Anomaly Detection (UniADet). Specifically, we first find language encoder is used to derive decision weights for anomaly classification and segmentation, and then demonstrate that it is unnecessary for universal AD. Second, we propose an embarrassingly simple method to completely decouple classification and segmentation, and decouple cross-level features, i.e., learning independent weights for different tasks and hierarchical features. UniADet is highly simple (learning only decoupled weights), parameter-efficient (only 0.002M learnable parameters), general (adapting a variety of foundation models), and effective (surpassing state-of-the-art zero-/few-shot by a large margin and even full-shot AD methods for the first time) on 14 real-world AD benchmarks covering both industrial and medical domains.

In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised facial expression recognition algorithm based on Dynamic Threshold Adjustment (DTA) and Selective Negative Learning (SNL). Initially, we designed strategies for local attention enhancement and random dropout of feature maps during feature extraction, which strengthen the representation of local features while ensuring the model does not overfit to any specific local area. Furthermore, this study introduces a dynamic thresholding method to adapt to the requirements of the semi-supervised learning framework for facial expression recognition tasks, and through a selective negative learning strategy, it fully utilizes unlabeled samples with low confidence by mining useful expression information from complementary labels, achieving impressive results.

A robust framework should be Topic-Adaptive, capturing macro-level joint distributions while ensuring micro-level individual rationality. Existing approaches fall into two categories: static data-based retrieval methods that fail to adapt to unseen topics absent from the data, and LLM-based generation methods that lack macro-level distribution awareness, resulting in inconsistencies between micro-level persona attributes and reality. To address these problems, we propose HAG, a Hierarchical Agent Generation framework that formalizes population generation as a two-stage decision process. Firstly, utilizing a World Knowledge Model to infer hierarchical conditional probabilities to construct the Topic-Adaptive Tree, achieving macro-level distribution alignment.

This covert harm is harder to detect than explicit misinformation yet remains underexplored. To address this gap, we develop a multi-stage pipeline that disentangles and simulates preview-based versus context-based understanding, enabling construction of the MM-Misleading benchmark. Using this benchmark, we systematically evaluate open-source LVLMs and uncover pronounced blind spots to omission-based misleadingness detection. We further propose OMGuard, which integrates (1) Interpretation-Aware Fine-Tuning, which used to improve multimodal misleadingness detection and (2) Rationale-Guided Misleading Content Correction, which uses explicit rationales to guide headline rewriting and reduce misleading impressions. Experiments show that OMGuard lifts an 8B model's detection accuracy to match a 235B LVLM and delivers markedly stronger end-to-end correction.

Several previous studies have used mixed-integer optimization (MIO) techniques to develop scoring systems for binary classification; however, they have not focused on directly maximizing AUC (i.e., area under the receiver operating characteristic curve), even though AUC is recognized as an essential evaluation metric for scoring systems. Our goal herein is to establish an effective MIO framework for constructing scoring systems that directly maximize the buffered AUC (bAUC) as the tightest concave lower bound on AUC. Our optimization model is formulated as a mixed-integer linear optimization (MILO) problem that maximizes bAUC subject to a group sparsity constraint for limiting the number of questions in the scoring system. Computational experiments using publicly available real-world datasets demonstrate that our MILO method can build scoring systems with superior AUC values compared to the baseline methods based on regularization and stepwise regression.

However, efficiently modeling and optimizing hybrid discrete-continuous action space remains a fundamental challenge, mainly due to limited policy expressiveness and poor scalability in high-dimensional settings. To address this challenge, we view the hybrid action space problem as a fully cooperative game and propose a \\textbf{Cooperative Hybrid Diffusion Policies (CHDP)} framework to solve it. CHDP employs two cooperative agents that leverage a discrete and a continuous diffusion policy, respectively. The continuous policy is conditioned on the discrete action's representation, explicitly modeling the dependency between them. This cooperative design allows the diffusion policies to leverage their expressiveness to capture complex distributions in their respective action spaces. To mitigate the update conflicts arising from simultaneous policy updates in this cooperative setting, we employ a sequential update scheme that fosters co-adaptation. Moreover, to improve scalability when learning in high-dimensional discrete action space, we construct a codebook that embeds the action space into a low-dimensional latent space. This mapping enables the discrete policy to learn in a compact, structured space. Finally, we design a Q-function-based guidance mechanism to align the codebook's embeddings with the discrete policy's representation during training. On challenging hybrid action benchmarks, CHDP outperforms the state-of-the-art method by up to $19.3\\%$ in success rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we propose a scalable multi-image editing framework for UMMs that explicitly distinguishes image identities and generalizes to variable input counts.

To facilitate training and evaluation, we establish a high-fidelity benchmark using an inverse dataset construction methodology to guarantee artifact-free, achievable outputs.

We propose a self-supervised approach for learning a JKO solution operator without requiring numerical solutions of any JKO trajectories. The learned operator maps an input density directly to the minimizer of the corresponding JKO subproblem, and can be iteratively applied to efficiently generate the gradient-flow evolution. A key challenge is that only a number of initial densities are typically available for training. To address this, we introduce a Learn-to-Evolve algorithm that jointly learns the JKO operator and its induced trajectories by alternating between trajectory generation and operator updates. As training progresses, the generated data increasingly approximates true JKO trajectories. Meanwhile, this Learn-to-Evolve strategy serves as a natural form of data augmentation, significantly enhancing the generalization ability of the learned operator.

To systematically analyze this phenomenon, we introduce LoopBench, a dataset designed to capture two distinct loop typologies: numerical loops and statement loops. Mechanistically, we characterize circular reasoning as a state collapse exhibiting distinct boundaries, where semantic repetition precedes textual repetition.

Using the LogiKEy methodology, we embed a range of classical and non-classical formalisms into higher-order logic (HOL), enabling a systematic comparison of inference quality, explanation refinement, and proof behavior. We focus on normative reasoning, where the choice of logic has significant implications. In particular, we compare logic-external approaches, where normative requirements are encoded via axioms, with logic-internal approaches, where normative patterns emerge from the logic's built-in structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that logic-internal strategies can consistently improve performance and produce more efficient hybrid proofs for NLI. In addition, we show that the effectiveness of a logic is domain-dependent, with first-order logic favouring commonsense reasoning, while deontic and modal logics excel in ethical domains.

Current detection methods often struggle to generalize to unseen generative models, and the rapid evolution of generative techniques continuously exacerbates this challenge. Without adaptability, detection models risk becoming ineffective in real-world applications. To address this critical issue, we propose a novel three-stage domain continual learning framework designed for continuous adaptation to evolving generative models. In the first stage, we employ a strategic parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach to develop a transferable offline detection model with strong generalization capabilities. Building upon this foundation, the second stage integrates unseen data streams into a continual learning process. To efficiently learn from limited samples of novel generated models and mitigate overfitting, we design a data augmentation chain with progressively increasing complexity. Furthermore, we leverage the Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC) method to approximate the Hessian and alleviate catastrophic forgetting. Finally, the third stage utilizes a linear interpolation strategy based on Linear Mode Connectivity, effectively capturing commonalities across diverse generative models and further enhancing overall performance.

It then applies differentiated optimization strategies to Gaussian models with varying degrees of significance, thereby significantly improving the model convergence rate.

Experimental results demonstrate that this method achieves a frame rate of up to 96 FPS on synthetic datasets, while effectively reducing both storage overhead and training time.Our code and data are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GS-DMSR-2212.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faGS-DMSR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68af\u5ea6\u805a\u7126\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6d41\u5f62\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u60013D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b33D\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u96be\u4ee5\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u8fd0\u52a8\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u9762", "method": "1. \u901a\u8fc7\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u9ad8\u65af\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68af\u5ea6\u805a\u7126\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u8fd0\u52a8\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b\n2. \u5bf9\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u7528\u5dee\u5f02\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\n3. \u96c6\u6210\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6d41\u5f62\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u9690\u5f0f\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u53d8\u5f62\u573a\u7684\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\u589e\u5f3a\u590d\u6742\u53d8\u5f62\u573a\u666f\u5efa\u6a21\u6548\u7387", "result": "1. \u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523096 FPS\u7684\u5e27\u7387\uff1b\n2. \u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u5b58\u50a8\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\uff1b\n3. \u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6", "conclusion": "GS-DMSR\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u52a8\u60013D\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u8d28\u91cf\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u6548\u679c"}}

The method estimates treatment effects up to an error $\u03b5> 0$ in each of $M$ different strata of the population, targeting individuals in decreasing order of estimated treatment effect until the budget runs out. In general, this method requires $O(M/\u03b5^2)$ samples. This is best possible if the goal is to estimate all treatment effects up to an $\u03b5$ error. In this work, we show how to achieve the same total treatment effect as CATE with only $O(M/\u03b5)$ samples for natural distributions of treatment effects. The key insight is that coarse estimates suffice for near-optimal treatment allocations. In addition, we show that budget flexibility can further reduce the sample complexity of allocation. Finally, we evaluate our algorithm on various real-world RCT datasets. In all cases, it finds nearly optimal treatment allocations with surprisingly few samples.

We introduce PII-VisBench, a novel benchmark containing 4000 unique probes designed to evaluate VLM safety through the continuum of online presence. The benchmark stratifies 200 subjects into four visibility categories: high, medium, low, and zero--based on the extent and nature of their information available online. We evaluate 18 open-source VLMs (0.3B-32B) based on two key metrics: percentage of PII probing queries refused (Refusal Rate) and the fraction of non-refusal responses flagged for containing PII (Conditional PII Disclosure Rate). Across models, we observe a consistent pattern: refusals increase and PII disclosures decrease (9.10% high to 5.34% low) as subject visibility drops. We identify that models are more likely to disclose PII for high-visibility subjects, alongside substantial model-family heterogeneity and PII-type disparities.

However, existing RLVR algorithms focus on different granularities, and each has complementary strengths and limitations. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) updates the policy with token-level importance ratios, which preserves fine-grained credit assignment but often suffers from high variance and instability. In contrast, Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) applies single sequence-level importance ratios across all tokens in a response that better matches sequence-level rewards, but sacrifices token-wise credit assignment. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Hybrid Policy Optimization (DHPO) to bridge GRPO and GSPO within a single clipped surrogate objective. DHPO combines token-level and sequence-level importance ratios using weighting mechanisms. We explore two variants of the mixing mechanism, including an averaged mixing and an entropy-guided mixing. To further stabilize training, we employ a branch-specific clipping strategy that constrains token-level and sequence-level ratios within separate trust regions before mixing, preventing outliers in either branch from dominating the update. Across seven challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, experiments on both dense and MoE models from the Qwen3 series show that DHPO consistently outperforms GRPO and GSPO.

Recently, researchers have further investigated Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) frameworks, which enhance the reasoning and collaboration capabilities of MAS through information exchange and debate among multiple agents. However, existing approaches often rely on unguided initialization, causing agents to adopt identical reasoning paths that lead to the same errors. As a result, effective debate among agents is hindered, and the final outcome frequently degenerates into simple majority voting. To solve the above problem, in this paper, we introduce Dynamic Multi-Agent Debate (DynaDebate), which enhances the effectiveness of multi-agent debate through three key mechanisms: (1) Dynamic Path Generation and Allocation, which employs a dedicated Path Generation Agent to generate diverse and logical solution paths with adaptive redundancy; (2) Process-Centric Debate, which shifts the focus from surface-level outcome voting to rigorous step-by-step logic critique to ensure process correctness; (3) A Trigger-Based Verification Agent, which is activated upon disagreement and uses external tools to objectively resolve deadlocks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DynaDebate achieves superior performance across various benchmarks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art MAD methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u5355\u4e00\u3001\u5bb9\u6613\u9677\u5165\u7b80\u5355\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff08DynaDebate\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u5f84\u751f\u6210\u3001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8fa9\u8bba\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u534f\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u521d\u59cb\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9677\u5165\u540c\u6837\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u8fa9\u8bba\u96be\u4ee5\u4ea7\u751f\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5f80\u5f80\u9000\u5316\u4e3a\u7b80\u5355\u591a\u6570\u6295\u7968\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u53d1\u6325\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDynaDebate\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5236\uff1a1\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u5f84\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u7531\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u751f\u6210\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ea7\u751f\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u89e3\u8def\u5f84\uff1b2\uff09\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5fc3\u8fa9\u8bba\uff0c\u6ce8\u91cd\u9010\u6b65\u903b\u8f91\u6279\u5224\u800c\u975e\u8868\u9762\u7ed3\u679c\u6295\u7968\uff1b3\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u5f53\u51fa\u73b0\u5206\u6b67\u65f6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u8fdb\u884c\u5ba2\u89c2\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDynaDebate\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DynaDebate\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u8def\u5f84\u751f\u6210\u3001\u6ce8\u91cd\u8fc7\u7a0b\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u5ba2\u89c2\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u4e2d\u8def\u5f84\u5355\u4e00\u548c\u7b80\u5355\u6295\u7968\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u534f\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

This reasoning unfaithfulness frequently manifests as hallucinated entities, mis-grounded relations, skipped steps, and over-specified reasoning. Existing preference-based approaches, typically relying on textual perturbations or answer-conditioned rationales, fail to address this challenge as they allow models to exploit language priors to bypass visual grounding. To address this, we propose SceneAlign, a framework that leverages scene graphs as structured visual information to perform controllable structural interventions. By identifying reasoning-critical nodes and perturbing them through four targeted strategies that mimic typical grounding failures, SceneAlign constructs hard negative rationales that remain linguistically plausible but are grounded in inaccurate visual facts. These contrastive pairs are used in Direct Preference Optimization to steer models toward fine-grained, structure-faithful reasoning. Across seven visual reasoning benchmarks, SceneAlign consistently improves answer accuracy and reasoning faithfulness, highlighting the effectiveness of grounding-aware alignment for multimodal reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, different sampling standards lead to diverse time granularities and variable sets across nodes, hindering classical federated learning. We propose PiXTime, a novel time series forecasting model designed for federated learning that enables effective prediction across nodes with multi-granularity and heterogeneous variable sets. PiXTime employs a personalized Patch Embedding to map node-specific granularity time series into token sequences of a unified dimension for processing by a subsequent shared model, and uses a global VE Table to align variable category semantics across nodes, thereby enhancing cross-node transferability. With a transformer-based shared model, PiXTime captures representations of auxiliary series with arbitrary numbers of variables and uses cross-attention to enhance the prediction of the target series. Experiments show PiXTime achieves state-of-the-art performance in federated settings and demonstrates superior performance on eight widely used real-world traditional benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Top-performing CUAs are framework-based systems that decompose planning and execution, while end-to-end screenshot-to-action policies are easier to deploy but lag behind on benchmarks such as OSWorld-Verified. GUI datasets like OSWorld pose two bottlenecks: they expose only a few hundred interactive, verifiable tasks and environments, and expert trajectories must be gathered by interacting with these environments, making such data hard to scale. We therefore ask how reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR) can best exploit a small pool of exist expert trajectories to train end-to-end policies. Naively mixing these off-policy traces into on-policy RLVR is brittle: even after format conversion, expert trajectories exhibit structural mismatch and distribution shift from the learner. We propose BEPA (Bi-Level Expert-to-Policy Assimilation), which turns static expert traces into policy-aligned guidance via self-rolled reachable trajectories under the base policy (LEVEL-1) and a per-task, dynamically updated cache used in RLVR (LEVEL-2). On OSWorld-Verified, BEPA improves UITARS1.5-7B success from 22.87% to 32.13% and raises a held-out split from 5.74% to 10.30%, with consistent gains on MMBench-GUI and Online-Mind2Web.

Most gait models strive to implicitly learn the common traits across different gait conditions in a data-driven manner to pull different gait conditions closer for recognition. However, relatively few studies have explicitly explored the inherent relations between different gait conditions. For this purpose, we attempt to establish connections among different gait conditions and propose a new perspective to achieve gait recognition: variations in different gait conditions can be approximately viewed as a combination of geometric transformations. In this case, all we need is to determine the types of geometric transformations and achieve geometric invariance, then identity invariance naturally follows. As an initial attempt, we explore three common geometric transformations (i.e., Reflect, Rotate, and Scale) and design a $\\mathcal{R}$eflect-$\\mathcal{R}$otate-$\\mathcal{S}$cale invariance learning framework, named ${\\mathcal{RRS}}$-Gait. Specifically, it first flexibly adjusts the convolution kernel based on the specific geometric transformations to achieve approximate feature equivariance. Then these three equivariant-aware features are respectively fed into a global pooling operation for final invariance-aware learning.

To address both task-level memory inefficiency and the inability to reuse coordination experience, we propose StackPlanner, a hierarchical multi-agent framework with explicit memory control. StackPlanner addresses these challenges by decoupling high-level coordination from subtask execution with active task-level memory control, and by learning to retrieve and exploit reusable coordination experience via structured experience memory and reinforcement learning. Experiments on multiple deep-search and agent system benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enabling reliable long-horizon multi-agent collaboration.", "AI": {"tldr": "StackPlanner\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u663e\u5f0f\u5185\u5b58\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u9ad8\u5c42\u534f\u8c03\u4e0e\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u91cd\u7528\u534f\u8c03\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u77e5\u8bc6\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e2d\u592e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5185\u5b58\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u81a8\u80c0\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u7d2f\u79ef\u548c\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faStackPlanner\u5206\u5c42\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5236\uff1a1)\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u5185\u5b58\u63a7\u5236\u5206\u79bb\u9ad8\u5c42\u534f\u8c03\u548c\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u6267\u884c\uff1b2)\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u91cd\u7528\u534f\u8c03\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6df1\u5ea6\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u957f\u671f\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "StackPlanner\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u957f\u671f\u534f\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, an ideal CL agent should not only be able to overcome CF, but also encourage positive forward and backward knowledge transfer (KT), i.e., using the learned knowledge from previous tasks for the new task learning (namely FKT), and improving the previous tasks' performance with the knowledge of the new task (namely BKT). To this end, this paper first models CL as an optimization problem in which each sequential learning task aims to achieve its optimal performance under the constraint that both FKT and BKT should be positive. It then proposes a novel Enhanced Task Continual Learning (ETCL) method, which achieves forgetting-free and positive KT. Furthermore, the bounds that can lead to negative FKT and BKT are estimated theoretically. Based on the bounds, a new strategy for online task similarity detection is also proposed to facilitate positive KT. To overcome CF, ETCL learns a set of task-specific binary masks to isolate a sparse sub-network for each task while preserving the performance of a dense network for the task. At the beginning of a new task learning, ETCL tries to align the new task's gradient with that of the sub-network of the previous most similar task to ensure positive FKT. By using a new bi-objective optimization strategy and an orthogonal gradient projection method, ETCL updates only the weights of previous similar tasks at the classification layer to achieve positive BKT. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that the proposed ETCL markedly outperforms strong baselines on dissimilar, similar, and mixed task sequences.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Real-time strategy (RTS) games serve as an ideal testbed for evaluating these two capabilities, as their inherent gameplay requires both macro-level strategic planning and micro-level tactical adaptation and action execution. Existing RTS game-based environments either suffer from relatively high computational demands or lack support for textual observations, which has constrained the use of RTS games for LLM evaluation. Motivated by this, we present TowerMind, a novel environment grounded in the tower defense (TD) subgenre of RTS games. TowerMind preserves the key evaluation strengths of RTS games for assessing LLMs, while featuring low computational demands and a multimodal observation space, including pixel-based, textual, and structured game-state representations. In addition, TowerMind supports the evaluation of model hallucination and provides a high degree of customizability. We design five benchmark levels to evaluate several widely used LLMs under different multimodal input settings. The results reveal a clear performance gap between LLMs and human experts across both capability and hallucination dimensions. The experiments further highlight key limitations in LLM behavior, such as inadequate planning validation, a lack of multifinality in decision-making, and inefficient action use. We also evaluate two classic reinforcement learning algorithms: Ape-X DQN and PPO. By offering a lightweight and multimodal design, TowerMind complements the existing RTS game-based environment landscape and introduces a new benchmark for the AI agent field.

Yet, most embodied AI research overlooks this, assuming instructions are clear and focusing on execution rather than confirmation. To address this critical safety gap, we are the first to define Open-Vocabulary 3D Instruction Ambiguity Detection, a fundamental new task where a model must determine if a command has a single, unambiguous meaning within a given 3D scene. To support this research, we build Ambi3D, the large-scale benchmark for this task, featuring over 700 diverse 3D scenes and around 22k instructions. Our analysis reveals a surprising limitation: state-of-the-art 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to reliably determine if an instruction is ambiguous. To address this challenge, we propose AmbiVer, a two-stage framework that collects explicit visual evidence from multiple views and uses it to guide an vision-language model (VLM) in judging instruction ambiguity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the challenge of our task and the effectiveness of AmbiVer, paving the way for safer and more trustworthy embodied AI.

These factors significantly degrade localisation accuracy, particularly when global models are applied without considering structural constraints. This paper introduces a clustering-based method that structures the fingerprint dataset prior to localisation. Fingerprints are grouped using either spatial or radio features, and clustering can be applied at the building or floor level. In the localisation phase, a clustering estimation procedure based on the strongest access points assigns unseen fingerprints to the most relevant cluster. Localisation is then performed only within the selected clusters, allowing learning models to operate on reduced and more coherent subsets of data. The effectiveness of the method is evaluated on three public datasets and several machine learning models. Results show a consistent reduction in localisation errors, particularly under building-level strategies, but at the cost of reducing the floor detection accuracy. These results demonstrate that explicitly structuring datasets through clustering is an effective and flexible approach for scalable indoor positioning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We derive a new, data-informed lower bound on SmoothLLM's defense probability by incorporating empirical models of attack success, providing a more trustworthy and practical safety certificate. By introducing the notion of (k, $\\varepsilon$)-unstable, our framework provides practitioners with actionable safety guarantees, enabling them to set certification thresholds that better reflect the real-world behavior of LLMs. Ultimately, this work contributes a practical and theoretically-grounded mechanism to make LLMs more resistant to the exploitation of their safety alignments, a critical challenge in secure AI deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Due to the need for precise and complex visual reasoning, automated chart understanding poses a significant challenge to existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Many MLLMs trained with reinforcement learning (RL) face the challenge of credit assignment. Their advantage estimation, typically performed at the trajectory level, cannot distinguish between correct and incorrect reasoning steps within a single generated response. To address this limitation, we introduce SketchVL, a novel MLLM that optimized with FinePO, a new RL algorithm designed for fine-grained credit assignment within each trajectory. SketchVL's methodology involves drawing its intermediate reasoning steps as markers on the image and feeding the annotated image back to itself, creating a robust, multi-step reasoning process. During training, the FinePO algorithm leverages a Fine-grained Process Reward Model (FinePRM) to score each drawing action within a trajectory, thereby precisely assigning credit for each step. This mechanism allows FinePO to more strongly reward correct tokens when a trajectory is globally successful, and more heavily penalize incorrect tokens when the trajectory is globally suboptimal, thus achieving fine-grained reinforcement signals. Experiments show that SketchVL learns to align its step-level behavior with the FinePRM, achieving an average performance gain of 7.23\\% over its base model across chart datasets, natural image datasets, and mathematics, providing a promising new direction for training powerful reasoning models.", "AI": {"tldr": "SketchVL\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLM\uff09\uff0c\u5b83\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed8\u56fe\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528FinePO\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f68\u8ff9\u5185\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u8868\u3001\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53477.23%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u8868\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u9ad8\u5bc6\u5ea6\u8f7d\u4f53\uff0c\u5176\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8981\u6c42\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u6210\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6311\u6218\u3002\u8bb8\u591a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684MLLM\u5728\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u4e0a\u9762\u4e34\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5373\u4ec5\u80fd\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u522b\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u52bf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u5355\u4e2a\u751f\u6210\u54cd\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u4e0e\u9519\u8bef\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5e94\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684MLLM\uff0c\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86SketchVL\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u7ed8\u5236\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u6807\u8bb0\uff08markers\uff09\u5e76\u5c06\u5e26\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u53cd\u9988\u7ed9\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u8eab\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6784\u5efa\u4e00\u4e2a\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528FinePO\u7b97\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff08FinePRM\uff09\u5bf9\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7ed8\u56fe\u52a8\u4f5c\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u5c06\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97FinePO\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u6574\u4f53\u6210\u529f\u65f6\u66f4\u5f3a\u5730\u5956\u52b1\u6b63\u786e\u7684token\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u5168\u5c40\u6b21\u4f18\u65f6\u66f4\u4e25\u5389\u5730\u60e9\u7f5a\u9519\u8bef\u7684token\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u83b7\u5f97\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSketchVL\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u5176\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0eFinePRM\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5728\u56fe\u8868\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4\u5176\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5e73\u57477.23%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "SketchVL\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed8\u56fe\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u548cFinePO\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u5316\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u56fe\u8868\u7406\u89e3\uff09\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u96be\u9898\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e5f\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Chen", "Somayeh Sojoudi"], "title": "Do Sparse Autoencoders Identify Reasoning Features in Language Models?", "comment": null, "summary": "We investigate whether sparse autoencoders (SAEs) identify genuine reasoning features in large language models (LLMs). Starting from features selected using standard contrastive activation methods, we introduce a falsification-oriented framework that combines causal token injection experiments and LLM-guided falsification to test whether feature activation reflects reasoning processes or superficial linguistic correlates. Across 20 configurations spanning multiple model families, layers, and reasoning datasets, we find that identified reasoning features are highly sensitive to token-level interventions. Injecting a small number of feature-associated tokens into non-reasoning text is sufficient to elicit strong activation for 59% to 94% of features, indicating reliance on lexical artifacts. For the remaining features that are not explained by simple token triggers, LLM-guided falsification consistently produces non-reasoning inputs that activate the feature and reasoning inputs that do not, with no analyzed feature satisfying our criteria for genuine reasoning behavior. Steering these features yields minimal changes or slight degradations in benchmark performance.

This paper introduces a novel, automated pipeline for generating large-scale, psychologically-grounded multi-turn jailbreak datasets. We systematically operationalize FITD techniques into reproducible templates, creating a benchmark of 1,500 scenarios across illegal activities and offensive content. We evaluate seven models from three major LLM families under both multi-turn (with history) and single-turn (without history) conditions. Our results reveal stark differences in contextual robustness: models in the GPT family demonstrate a significant vulnerability to conversational history, with Attack Success Rates (ASR) increasing by as much as 32 percentage points. In contrast, Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash exhibits exceptional resilience, proving nearly immune to these attacks, while Anthropic's Claude 3 Haiku shows strong but imperfect resistance.

We analyze the scalability limitations of existing discretization-based approaches for generating hybrid discrete-continuous sequences, particularly in high-precision domains such as semiconductor circuit designs, where precision loss can lead to functional failure. To address the challenge, we propose AGDC, a novel unified framework that jointly models discrete and continuous values for variable-length sequences. AGDC employs a hybrid approach that combines categorical prediction for discrete values with diffusion-based modeling for continuous values, incorporating two key technical components: an end-of-sequence (EOS) logit adjustment mechanism that uses an MLP to dynamically adjust EOS token logits based on sequence context, and a length regularization term integrated into the loss function. Additionally, we present ContLayNet, a large-scale benchmark comprising 334K high-precision semiconductor layout samples with specialized evaluation metrics that capture functional correctness where precision errors significantly impact performance.

The original work reports strong performance and suggests that recursive latent updates enable non-trivial reasoning, but it remains unclear how much of this performance stems from architecture, test-time compute, or task-specific priors. In this technical note, we empirically analyze the ARC Prize TRM checkpoint on ARC-AGI-1 and report four behavioral findings and an efficiency comparison. First, we show that test-time augmentation and majority-vote ensembling account for a substantial fraction of reported performance: the 1000-sample voting pipeline improves Pass@1 by about 11 percentage points over single-pass canonical inference. Second, a puzzle-identity ablation reveals strict dependence on task identifiers: replacing the correct puzzle ID with a blank or random token yields zero accuracy. Third, a recursion trajectory analysis shows that most of the final accuracy is achieved at the first recursion step and that performance saturates after few latent updates, indicating shallow effective recursion. Fourth, early-stage training experiments under canonical versus heavy augmentation regimes suggest that heavy augmentation broadens the distribution of candidate solutions and improves multi-sample success. Finally, we compare TRM with a naive QLoRA fine-tune of Llama 3 8B on canonical ARC-AGI-1, finding that TRM's non-autoregressive design achieves much higher throughput and substantially lower memory usage in this setting.

To address this limitation, we present TAGRPO, a robust post-training framework for I2V models inspired by contrastive learning. Our approach is grounded in the observation that rollout videos generated from identical initial noise provide superior guidance for optimization. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel GRPO loss applied to intermediate latents, encouraging direct alignment with high-reward trajectories while maximizing distance from low-reward counterparts. Furthermore, we introduce a memory bank for rollout videos to enhance diversity and reduce computational overhead.

Unlike previous semantic SLAM approaches (which embed pre-defined class labels) FeatureSLAM enables entirely new downstream tasks via free-viewpoint, open-set segmentation. Across standard benchmarks, our method achieves real-time tracking, on par with state-of-the-art systems while improving tracking stability and map fidelity without prohibitive compute. Quantitatively, we obtain 9\\% lower pose error and 8\\% higher mapping accuracy compared to recent fixed-set SLAM baselines.

However, unconstrained residual matrices can compromise training stability. To address this, DeepSeek's Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC) approximately projects these matrices onto the Birkhoff polytope via iterative Sinkhorn--Knopp (SK) normalization. We identify two limitations of this approach: (i) finite SK iterations do not guarantee exact doubly stochasticity, leaving an approximation gap that can accumulate through network depth and undermine stability; (ii) efficient SK implementation requires highly specialized CUDA kernels, raising engineering barriers and reducing portability. Motivated by the Birkhoff--von Neumann theorem, we propose mHC-lite, a simple reparameterization that explicitly constructs doubly stochastic matrices as convex combinations of permutation matrices. This approach guarantees exact doubly stochasticity by construction and can be implemented using only native matrix operations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that mHC-lite matches or exceeds mHC in performance while achieving higher training throughput with a naive implementation and eliminating the residual instabilities observed in both HC and mHC.

We demonstrate that high-quality face images exhibit stable feature refinement trajectories across blocks, while degraded images show erratic transformations. Our method computes Euclidean distances between L2-normalized patch embeddings from consecutive transformer blocks and aggregates them into image-level quality scores. We empirically validate this correlation on a quality-labeled synthetic dataset with controlled degradation levels.

Through extensive evaluation on eight benchmarks (LFW, AgeDB-30, CFP-FP, CALFW, Adience, CPLFW, XQLFW, IJB-C), we show that ViTNT-FIQA achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while maintaining computational efficiency and immediate applicability to any pre-trained ViT-based face recognition model.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Through a comprehensive grid search of 492 Variational Autoencoder configurations, we show that while skip connections minimize reconstruction error (Mean Absolute Error approximately 0.0012), they induce \"overgeneralization\", allowing the model to reconstruct noise and masking the detection signal. In contrast, attention mechanisms prioritize global context over local detail and yield the highest detection performance with an area-under-the-curve of 0.875. The attention-based Variational Autoencoder achieves an area-under-the-curve of 0.91 in the 0 to 40-kilometer near-source range, demonstrating high suitability for immediate early warning applications.

However, extending this paradigm to Transformer is hindered by superposition, where entangled features encoded in overlapping directions obstruct the extraction of symbolic expressions. In this work, we propose the Discrete Transformer, an architecture explicitly engineered to bridge the gap between continuous representations and discrete symbolic logic. By enforcing a strict functional disentanglement, which constrains Numerical Attention to information routing and Numerical MLP to element-wise arithmetic, and employing temperature-annealed sampling, our method effectively facilitates the extraction of human-readable programs. Empirically, the Discrete Transformer not only achieves performance comparable to RNN-based baselines but crucially extends interpretability to continuous variable domains. Moreover, our analysis of the annealing process shows that the efficient discrete search undergoes a clear phase transition from exploration to exploitation. We further demonstrate that our method enables fine-grained control over synthesized programs by imposing inductive biases. Collectively, these findings establish the Discrete Transformer as a robust framework for demonstration-free algorithm discovery, offering a rigorous pathway toward Transformer interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Tensor-DTI employs a siamese dual-encoder architecture, enabling it to capture both chemical and structural interaction features while distinguishing interacting from non-interacting pairs.

We also conduct large-scale inference experiments on CDK2 across billion-scale chemical libraries, where Tensor-DTI produces chemically plausible hit distributions even when CDK2 is withheld from training. In enrichment studies against Glide docking and Boltz-2 co-folder, Tensor-DTI remains competitive on CDK2 and improves the screening budget required to recover moderate fractions of high-affinity ligands on out-of-family targets under strict family-holdout splits.

In this paper, we study whether the fusion mechanism itself affects performance, particularly in long-sequence settings. We conduct a controlled empirical study comparing three canonical fusion strategies--element-wise addition, concatenation with projection, and scalar gated fusion--under identical Transformer architectures, data splits, and random seeds. Experiments on three text classification datasets spanning short (AG News), medium (IMDB), and long (ArXiv) sequences show that fusion choice has negligible impact on short texts but produces consistent gains on long documents. To verify that these gains are structural rather than stochastic, we perform paired-seed analysis and cross-dataset comparison across sequence-length regimes. Additional experiments on the ArXiv dataset indicate that the benefit of learnable fusion generalizes across multiple positional encoding families. Finally, we explore a lightweight convolutional gating mechanism that introduces local inductive bias at the fusion level, evaluated on long documents only.

While prior studies have proposed various approaches that primarily focus on enforcing cross-view constraints at the photometric level, few explicitly exploit the rich geometric structure inherent in both monocular and surround-view setting. In this work, we propose GeoSurDepth, a framework that leverages geometry consistency as the primary cue for surround-view depth estimation. Concretely, we utilize foundation models as a pseudo geometry prior and feature representation enhancement tool to guide the network to maintain surface normal consistency in spatial 3D space and regularize object- and texture-consistent depth estimation in 2D. In addition, we introduce a novel view synthesis pipeline where 2D-3D lifting is achieved with dense depth reconstructed via spatial warping, encouraging additional photometric supervision across temporal, spatial, and spatial-temporal contexts, and compensating for the limitations of single-view image reconstruction. Finally, a newly-proposed adaptive joint motion learning strategy enables the network to adaptively emphasize informative spatial geometry cues for improved motion reasoning. Extensive experiments on DDAD and nuScenes demonstrate that GeoSurDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach.

Eye movement data offers a non-invasive diagnostic tool for ASD detection, as it is inherently discrete and exhibits short-term temporal dependencies, reflecting localized gaze focus between fixation points. These characteristics enable the data to provide deeper insights into subtle behavioral markers, distinguishing ASD-related patterns from typical development. Eye movement signals mainly contain short-term and localized dependencies. However, despite the widespread application of stacked attention layers in Transformer-based models for capturing long-range dependencies, our experimental results indicate that this approach yields only limited benefits when applied to eye movement data. This may be because discrete fixation points and short-term dependencies in gaze focus reduce the utility of global attention mechanisms, making them less efficient than architectures focusing on local temporal patterns. To efficiently capture subtle and complex eye movement patterns, distinguishing ASD from typically developing (TD) individuals, a discrete short-term sequential (DSTS) modeling framework is designed with Class-aware Representation and Imbalance-aware Mechanisms.

However, specifying precise goals for these models remains a challenge; text instructions are often too abstract to capture physical nuances, while target images are frequently infeasible to specify for dynamic tasks. To address this, we introduce Goal Force, a novel framework that allows users to define goals via explicit force vectors and intermediate dynamics, mirroring how humans conceptualize physical tasks. We train a video generation model on a curated dataset of synthetic causal primitives-such as elastic collisions and falling dominos-teaching it to propagate forces through time and space. Despite being trained on simple physics data, our model exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization to complex, real-world scenarios, including tool manipulation and multi-object causal chains.

Here we introduce Poisson NMF with the shifted-log link function to relax this assumption. The shifted-log link function has a single tuning parameter, and as this parameter varies the model changes from assuming that parts combine additively (i.e., standard Poisson NMF) to assuming that parts combine more multiplicatively. We provide an algorithm to fit this model by maximum likelihood, and also an approximation that substantially reduces computation time for large, sparse datasets (computations scale with the number of non-zero entries in the data matrix). We illustrate these new methods on a variety of real datasets.

The semantic homogeneity of random rollouts often traps models in narrow, over-optimized behaviors. While existing methods leverage policy entropy to encourage exploration, they face inherent limitations. Global entropy regularization is susceptible to reward hacking, which can induce meaningless verbosity, whereas local token-selective updates struggle with the strong inductive bias of pre-trained models. To address this, we propose Latent Policy Optimization via Iterative Information Bottleneck (IIB-LPO), a novel approach that shifts exploration from statistical perturbation of token distributions to topological branching of reasoning trajectories. IIB-LPO triggers latent branching at high-entropy states to diversify reasoning paths and employs the Information Bottleneck principle both as a trajectory filter and a self-reward mechanism, ensuring concise and informative exploration. Empirical results across four mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that IIB-LPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing prior methods by margins of up to 5.3% in accuracy and 7.4% in diversity metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faIIB-LPO\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u652f\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728LLM\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u5377\u5c55\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u9677\u5165\u72ed\u7a84\u4f18\u5316\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b56\u7565\u71b5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u6216\u65e0\u610f\u4e49\u5197\u957f\u7b49\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fed\u4ee3\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5c06\u63a2\u7d22\u4ecetoken\u5206\u5e03\u7edf\u8ba1\u6270\u52a8\u8f6c\u5411\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u62d3\u6251\u5206\u652f\u3002\u5728\u9ad8\u71b5\u72b6\u6001\u89e6\u53d1\u6f5c\u5728\u5206\u652f\u4ee5\u591a\u6837\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u548c\u81ea\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe5.3%\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe7.4%\u3002", "conclusion": "IIB-LPO\u901a\u8fc7\u62d3\u6251\u5206\u652f\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86RLVR\u4e2d\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002"}}

Code at: https://github.com/taozh2017/BCSI", "summary": "Semi-supervised medical image segmentation is an effective method for addressing scenarios with limited labeled data. Existing methods mainly rely on frameworks such as mean teacher and dual-stream consistency learning. These approaches often face issues like error accumulation and model structural complexity, while also neglecting the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data streams. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Bidirectional Channel-selective Semantic Interaction~(BCSI) framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. First, we propose a Semantic-Spatial Perturbation~(SSP) mechanism, which disturbs the data using two strong augmentation operations and leverages unsupervised learning with pseudo-labels from weak augmentations. Additionally, we employ consistency on the predictions from the two strong augmentations to further improve model stability and robustness. Second, to reduce noise during the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data, we propose a Channel-selective Router~(CR) component, which dynamically selects the most relevant channels for information exchange. This mechanism ensures that only highly relevant features are activated, minimizing unnecessary interference. Finally, the Bidirectional Channel-wise Interaction~(BCI) strategy is employed to supplement additional semantic information and enhance the representation of important channels. Experimental results on multiple benchmarking 3D medical datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing semi-supervised approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A common strategy is to divide the domain into several regions (patches) and simplify the equation in each region. When approximate analytic solutions can be obtained in each patch, they are then matched at the interfaces to construct a global solution. However, this patching procedure can fail to reproduce the correct solution, since the approximate forms may break down near the matching boundaries. In this work, we propose a learning framework in which the integration constants of asymptotic analytic solutions are promoted to scale-dependent functions. By constraining these coefficient functions with the original differential equation over the domain, the network learns a globally valid solution that smoothly interpolates between asymptotic regimes, eliminating the need for arbitrary boundary matching. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework in representative problems from chemical kinetics and cosmology, where it accurately reproduces global solutions and outperforms conventional matching procedures.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, most existing approaches rely primarily on spectral magnitude, implicitly under exploring the role of phase information. In this work, we propose Phase4DFD, a phase aware frequency domain deepfake detection framework that explicitly models phase magnitude interactions via a learnable attention mechanism. Our approach augments standard RGB input with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) magnitude and local binary pattern (LBP) representations to expose subtle synthesis artifacts that remain indistinguishable under spatial analysis alone. Crucially, we introduce an input level phase aware attention module that uses phase discontinuities commonly introduced by synthetic generation to guide the model toward frequency patterns that are most indicative of manipulation before backbone feature extraction. The attended multi domain representation is processed by an efficient BNext M backbone, with optional channel spatial attention applied for semantic feature refinement. Extensive experiments on the CIFAKE and DFFD datasets demonstrate that our proposed model Phase4DFD outperforms state of the art spatial and frequency-based detectors while maintaining low computational overhead. Comprehensive ablation studies further confirm that explicit phase modeling provides complementary and non-redundant information beyond magnitude-only frequency representations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, in real-world deployments, auditing is complicated by the fact that model owners may adaptively update their models in response to changing environments, such as financial markets. These updates can alter the underlying model class while preserving certain properties of interest, raising fundamental questions about what can be reliably audited under such shifts.\n  In this work, we study group fairness auditing under arbitrary updates. We consider general shifts that modify the pre-audit model class while maintaining invariance of the audited property. Our goals are two-fold: (i) to characterize the information complexity of allowable updates, by identifying which strategic changes preserve the property under audit; and (ii) to efficiently estimate auditing properties, such as group fairness, using a minimal number of labeled samples.\n  We propose a generic framework for PAC auditing based on an Empirical Property Optimization (EPO) oracle. For statistical parity, we establish distribution-free auditing bounds characterized by the SP dimension, a novel combinatorial measure that captures the complexity of admissible strategic updates. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework naturally extends to other auditing objectives, including prediction error and robust risk.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The design plugs directly into standard transformer backbones (eg ViT and Swin) and adds fewer than 2 % parameters.

To address this gap, we introduce 'SubDistill', a new distillation algorithm with improved numerical properties that only distills the relevant components of the teacher model at each layer.

Traditional forecasting methods, while theoretically interpretable, often require extensive manual tuning and are difficult to replicate in proprietary environments. Machine learning approaches offer predictive flexibility but introduce challenges related to interpretability, stochastic training procedures, and cross-environment reproducibility. This paper examines Prophet, an open-source forecasting framework developed by Meta, as a reproducibility-enabling solution that balances interpretability, standardized workflows, and accessibility. Rather than proposing a new algorithm, this study evaluates how Prophet's additive structure, open-source implementation, and standardized workflow contribute to transparent and replicable forecasting practice. Using publicly available financial and retail datasets, we compare Prophet's performance and interpretability with multiple ARIMA specifications (auto-selected, manually specified, and seasonal variants) and Random Forest under a controlled and fully documented experimental design. This multi-model comparison provides a robust assessment of Prophet's relative performance and reproducibility advantages. Through concrete Python examples, we demonstrate how Prophet facilitates efficient forecasting workflows and integration with analytical pipelines. The study positions Prophet within the broader context of reproducible research.

In this work, we probe the layer-wise generation dynamics that drive hallucinations and propose a training-free mitigation strategy. Employing the Logit Lens, we examine how LVLMs construct next-token distributions across decoder layers, uncovering a pronounced commitment-depth gap: truthful tokens accumulate probability mass on their final candidates earlier than hallucinatory ones. Drawing on this discovery, we introduce Context Embedding Injection (CEI), a lightweight method that harnesses the hidden state of the last input token-the context embedding-as a grounding signal to maintain visual fidelity throughout decoding and curb hallucinations. Evaluated on the CHAIR, AMBER, and MMHal-Bench benchmarks (with a maximum token length of 512), CEI outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across three LVLMs, with its dynamic variant yielding the lowest overall hallucination rates. By integrating novel mechanistic insights with a scalable intervention, this work advances the mitigation of hallucinations in LVLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(LVLMs)\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u5f00\u653e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5e7b\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Logit Lens\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u5206\u5c42\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u8bb0\u6bd4\u5e7b\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u66f4\u65e9\u7d2f\u79ef\u6982\u7387\u8d28\u91cf\u7684'\u627f\u8bfa\u6df1\u5ea6\u5dee\u8ddd'\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5d4c\u5165\u6ce8\u5165(CEI)\u7684\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u5f00\u653e\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u54cd\u5e94\uff0c\u662f\u5f53\u524dLVLMs\u7684\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u4ea7\u751f\u673a\u5236\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Logit Lens\u5206\u6790LVLMs\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5404\u5c42\u6784\u5efa\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u6807\u8bb0\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u8bb0\u4e0e\u5e7b\u89c9\u6807\u8bb0\u5728\u627f\u8bfa\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u63d0\u51faContext Embedding Injection (CEI)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f93\u5165\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57fa\u7840\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002", "result": "\u5728CHAIR\u3001AMBER\u548cMMHal-Bench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5(\u6700\u5927\u6807\u8bb0\u957f\u5ea6512)\u4e0a\uff0cCEI\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aLVLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u4f53\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u4f4e\u7684\u603b\u4f53\u5e7b\u89c9\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6d1e\u5bdf\u4e0e\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u5728\u5927\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u5e7b\u89c9\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

While the Segment Anything Model (SAM) exhibits remarkable zero-shot capabilities, existing SAM-based methods rely on simple adapter fine-tuning while overlooking frequency-domain information that encodes domain-invariant features, resulting in degraded generalization under illumination and contrast variations. Furthermore, SAM's direct upsampling inevitably loses fine vessel details. To address these limitations, we propose WaveRNet, a wavelet-guided frequency learning framework for robust multi-source domain-generalized retinal vessel segmentation. Specifically, we devise a Spectral-guided Domain Modulator (SDM) that integrates wavelet decomposition with learnable domain tokens, enabling the separation of illumination-robust low-frequency structures from high-frequency vessel boundaries while facilitating domain-specific feature generation. Furthermore, we introduce a Frequency-Adaptive Domain Fusion (FADF) module that performs intelligent test-time domain selection through wavelet-based frequency similarity and soft-weighted fusion. Finally, we present a Hierarchical Mask-Prompt Refiner (HMPR) that overcomes SAM's upsampling limitation through coarse-to-fine refinement with long-range dependency modeling. Extensive experiments under the Leave-One-Domain-Out protocol on four public retinal datasets demonstrate that WaveRNet achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance.

Communities of Interest (CoIs) provide a promising paradigm for organising heterogeneous IoT sensor networks by grouping devices with similar operational and environmental characteristics. This work presents an anomaly detection framework based on the CoI paradigm by grouping sensors into communities using a fused similarity matrix that incorporates temporal correlations via Spearman coefficients, spatial proximity using Gaussian distance decay, and elevation similarities. For each community, representative stations based on the best silhouette are selected and three autoencoder architectures (BiLSTM, LSTM, and MLP) are trained using Bayesian hyperparameter optimization with expanding window cross-validation and tested on stations from the same cluster and the best representative stations of other clusters. The models are trained on normal temperature patterns of the data and anomalies are detected through reconstruction error analysis. Experimental results show a robust within-community performance across the evaluated configurations, while variations across communities are observed. Overall, the results support the applicability of community-based model sharing in reducing computational overhead and to analyse model generalisability across IoT sensor networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We evaluate the proposed method on multiple EEG datasets spanning diverse clinical environments, patient populations, and recording modalities, including routine clinical EEG and long-term ambulatory recordings, in order to study performance across varying data distributions. The evaluation includes publicly available datasets as well as a large proprietary collection of home EEG recordings, providing complementary views of controlled clinical data and unconstrained home-monitoring conditions. Our results show that LookAroundNet achieves strong performance across datasets, generalizes well to previously unseen recording conditions, and operates with computational costs compatible with real-world clinical deployment.
