Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究使用Planet Labs的4波段卫星图像和深度学习模型，能够近乎实时地监测苏丹武装冲突中的火灾破坏情况，相比基线方法更准确地识别活跃火灾和烧焦区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 苏丹持续战争带来的挑战凸显了对冲突进行快速监测和分析的需求。深度学习技术和现成卫星遥感影像的进步使得近实时监测成为可能。

Method: 利用Planet Labs的4波段卫星影像，结合深度学习模型，通过五个苏丹案例研究展示火灾破坏监测方法的有效性。

Result: 相比基线方法，自动化方法能更准确地捕捉活跃火灾和烧焦区域。使用8波段影像或时间序列影像仅带来边际增益。

Conclusion: 基于4波段卫星影像的深度学习方法可以有效监测武装冲突中的火灾破坏，实现近乎实时的监测，且更复杂的影像数据带来的改进有限。

Abstract: The challenges of ongoing war in Sudan highlight the need for rapid moni- toring and analysis of such conflicts. Advances in deep learning and readily available satellite remote sensing imagery allow for near real-time monitor- ing. This paper uses 4-band imagery from Planet Labs with a deep learning model to show that fire damage in armed conflicts can be monitored with minimal delay. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using five case studies in Sudan. We show that, compared to a baseline, the automated method captures the active fires and charred areas more accurately. Our re- sults indicate that using 8-band imagery or time series of such imagery only result in marginal gains.

Abstract: Video face swapping is crucial in film and entertainment production, where achieving high fidelity and temporal consistency over long and complex video sequences remains a significant challenge. Inspired by recent advances in reference-guided image editing, we explore whether rich visual attributes from source videos can be similarly leveraged to enhance both fidelity and temporal coherence in video face swapping. Building on this insight, this work presents LivingSwap, the first video reference guided face swapping model. Our approach employs keyframes as conditioning signals to inject the target identity, enabling flexible and controllable editing. By combining keyframe conditioning with video reference guidance, the model performs temporal stitching to ensure stable identity preservation and high-fidelity reconstruction across long video sequences. To address the scarcity of data for reference-guided training, we construct a paired face-swapping dataset, Face2Face, and further reverse the data pairs to ensure reliable ground-truth supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results, seamlessly integrating the target identity with the source video's expressions, lighting, and motion, while significantly reducing manual effort in production workflows.

TL;DR: FRIEDA是一个评估LVLMs复杂开放式地图推理能力的基准数据集，涵盖拓扑、度量和方向三类空间关系，要求多步推理和跨地图关联，现有最优模型性能远低于人类水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前地图视觉问答研究常将地图视为图表的特例，但地图理解需要解读分层符号系统和跨地图的空间关系，现有评估方法未能充分测试复杂的地图推理能力。

Method: 从各领域真实地图文档中收集地图图像，基于GIS分类构建包含拓扑、度量、方向三类空间关系的问题，所有问题都需要多步推理，部分需要跨地图关联。

Result: 评估11个先进LVLMs，在最直接的设置下，最强模型Gemini-2.5-Pro和GPT-5-Think准确率仅为38.20%和37.20%，远低于人类84.87%的表现。

Conclusion: LVLMs在多步地图推理能力上仍存在显著差距，FRIEDA可作为推动LVLMs空间智能发展的严格基准。

Abstract: Cartographic reasoning is the skill of interpreting geographic relationships by aligning legends, map scales, compass directions, map texts, and geometries across one or more map images. Although essential as a concrete cognitive capability and for critical tasks such as disaster response and urban planning, it remains largely unevaluated. Building on progress in chart and infographic understanding, recent large vision language model studies on map visual question-answering often treat maps as a special case of charts. In contrast, map VQA demands comprehension of layered symbology (e.g., symbols, geometries, and text labels) as well as spatial relations tied to orientation and distance that often span multiple maps and are not captured by chart-style evaluations. To address this gap, we introduce FRIEDA, a benchmark for testing complex open-ended cartographic reasoning in LVLMs. FRIEDA sources real map images from documents and reports in various domains and geographical areas. Following classifications in Geographic Information System (GIS) literature, FRIEDA targets all three categories of spatial relations: topological (border, equal, intersect, within), metric (distance), and directional (orientation). All questions require multi-step inference, and many require cross-map grounding and reasoning. We evaluate eleven state-of-the-art LVLMs under two settings: (1) the direct setting, where we provide the maps relevant to the question, and (2) the contextual setting, where the model may have to identify the maps relevant to the question before reasoning. Even the strongest models, Gemini-2.5-Pro and GPT-5-Think, achieve only 38.20% and 37.20% accuracy, respectively, far below human performance of 84.87%. These results reveal a persistent gap in multi-step cartographic reasoning, positioning FRIEDA as a rigorous benchmark to drive progress on spatial intelligence in LVLMs.

Abstract: Neural networks are frequently used in medical diagnosis. However, due to their black-box nature, model explainers are used to help clinicians understand better and trust model outputs. This paper introduces an explainer method for classifying Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP) from fundus images. Previous methods fail to generate explanations that preserve input image structures such as smoothness and sparsity. We introduce Sparse and Smooth Explainer (SSplain), a method that generates pixel-wise explanations while preserving image structures by enforcing smoothness and sparsity. This results in realistic explanations to enhance the understanding of the given black-box model. To achieve this goal, we define an optimization problem with combinatorial constraints and solve it using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). Experimental results show that SSplain outperforms commonly used explainers in terms of both post-hoc accuracy and smoothness analyses. Additionally, SSplain identifies features that are consistent with domain-understandable features that clinicians consider as discriminative factors for ROP. We also show SSplain's generalization by applying it to additional publicly available datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/neu-spiral/SSplain.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Our aim is to develop a unified model for sign language understanding, that performs sign language translation (SLT) and sign-subtitle alignment (SSA). Together, these two tasks enable the conversion of continuous signing videos into spoken language text and also the temporal alignment of signing with subtitles -- both essential for practical communication, large-scale corpus construction, and educational applications. To achieve this, our approach is built upon three components: (i) a lightweight visual backbone that captures manual and non-manual cues from human keypoints and lip-region images while preserving signer privacy; (ii) a Sliding Perceiver mapping network that aggregates consecutive visual features into word-level embeddings to bridge the vision-text gap; and (iii) a multi-task scalable training strategy that jointly optimises SLT and SSA, reinforcing both linguistic and temporal alignment. To promote cross-linguistic generalisation, we pretrain our model on large-scale sign-text corpora covering British Sign Language (BSL) and American Sign Language (ASL) from the BOBSL and YouTube-SL-25 datasets. With this multilingual pretraining and strong model design, we achieve state-of-the-art results on the challenging BOBSL (BSL) dataset for both SLT and SSA. Our model also demonstrates robust zero-shot generalisation and finetuned SLT performance on How2Sign (ASL), highlighting the potential of scalable translation across different sign languages.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于频域掩码的通用深度伪造检测方法，通过在训练时应用随机频域掩码来增强模型对不同生成模型的泛化能力，并在模型剪枝后仍保持良好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的通用深伪检测方法需要能够广泛识别各种生成模型生成的图像，包括未见过的模型；同时，随着新型深伪技术的频繁出现，模型需要强大的泛化能力，并且还需要最小化计算开销以实现大规模深伪筛查，这是绿色AI时代的关键目标。

Conclusion: 频域基掩码是实现可持续和通用深伪检测的一个实用步骤，为资源有限的大规模深伪筛查提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Universal deepfake detection aims to identify AI-generated images across a broad range of generative models, including unseen ones. This requires robust generalization to new and unseen deepfakes, which emerge frequently, while minimizing computational overhead to enable large-scale deepfake screening, a critical objective in the era of Green AI. In this work, we explore frequency-domain masking as a training strategy for deepfake detectors. Unlike traditional methods that rely heavily on spatial features or large-scale pretrained models, our approach introduces random masking and geometric transformations, with a focus on frequency masking due to its superior generalization properties. We demonstrate that frequency masking not only enhances detection accuracy across diverse generators but also maintains performance under significant model pruning, offering a scalable and resource-conscious solution. Our method achieves state-of-the-art generalization on GAN- and diffusion-generated image datasets and exhibits consistent robustness under structured pruning. These results highlight the potential of frequency-based masking as a practical step toward sustainable and generalizable deepfake detection.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Distribution shifts at test time degrade image classifiers. Recent continual test-time adaptation (CTTA) methods use masking to regulate learning, but often depend on calibrated uncertainty or stable attention scores and introduce added complexity. We ask: do we need custom-made masking designs, or can a simple random masking schedule suffice under strong corruption? We introduce Mask to Adapt (M2A), a simple CTTA approach that generates a short sequence of masked views (spatial or frequency) and adapts with two objectives: a mask consistency loss that aligns predictions across different views and an entropy minimization loss that encourages confident outputs. Motivated by masked image modeling, we study two common masking families -- spatial masking and frequency masking -- and further compare subtypes within each (spatial: patch vs.\ pixel; frequency: all vs.\ low vs.\ high). On CIFAR10C/CIFAR100C/ImageNetC (severity~5), M2A (Spatial) attains 8.3\%/19.8\%/39.2\% mean error, outperforming or matching strong CTTA baselines, while M2A (Frequency) lags behind. Ablations further show that simple random masking is effective and robust. These results indicate that a simple random masking schedule, coupled with consistency and entropy objectives, is sufficient to drive effective test-time adaptation without relying on uncertainty or attention signals.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We present a central-peripheral vision-inspired framework (CVP), a simple yet effective multimodal model for spatial reasoning that draws inspiration from the two types of human visual fields -- central vision and peripheral vision. Existing approaches primarily rely on unstructured representations, such as point clouds, voxels, or patch features, and inject scene context implicitly via coordinate embeddings. However, this often results in limited spatial reasoning capabilities due to the lack of explicit, high-level structural understanding. To address this limitation, we introduce two complementary components into a Large Multimodal Model-based architecture: target-affinity token, analogous to central vision, that guides the model's attention toward query-relevant objects; and allocentric grid, akin to peripheral vision, that captures global scene context and spatial arrangements. These components work in tandem to enable structured, context-aware understanding of complex 3D environments. Experiments show that CVP achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of 3D scene understanding benchmarks.

Conclusion: Fourier-RWKV通过创新的三态感知范式解决了不均匀雾霾场景下的除雾挑战，在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了卓越的恢复效果，为实际应用提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Image dehazing is crucial for reliable visual perception, yet it remains highly challenging under real-world non-uniform haze conditions. Although Transformer-based methods excel at capturing global context, their quadratic computational complexity hinders real-time deployment. To address this, we propose Fourier Receptance Weighted Key Value (Fourier-RWKV), a novel dehazing framework based on a Multi-State Perception paradigm. The model achieves comprehensive haze degradation modeling with linear complexity by synergistically integrating three distinct perceptual states: (1) Spatial-form Perception, realized through the Deformable Quad-directional Token Shift (DQ-Shift) operation, which dynamically adjusts receptive fields to accommodate local haze variations; (2) Frequency-domain Perception, implemented within the Fourier Mix block, which extends the core WKV attention mechanism of RWKV from the spatial domain to the Fourier domain, preserving the long-range dependencies essential for global haze estimation while mitigating spatial attenuation; (3) Semantic-relation Perception, facilitated by the Semantic Bridge Module (SBM), which utilizes Dynamic Semantic Kernel Fusion (DSK-Fusion) to precisely align encoder-decoder features and suppress artifacts. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Fourier-RWKV delivers state-of-the-art performance across diverse haze scenarios while significantly reducing computational overhead, establishing a favorable trade-off between restoration quality and practical efficiency.

TL;DR: GeoLoom框架通过自动形式化和坐标求解，将自然语言几何描述转换为精确的几何图形，显著提升了文本到几何图生成的准确性和可解释性。

Motivation: 现有几何图生成方法在空间准确性方面存在挑战，而几何领域的结构化约束为实现高精度生成提供了机会。受基于形式语言的几何问题求解方法启发，作者希望通过形式化方法提升几何图生成的质量和可解释性。

Method: GeoLoom框架包含两个核心组件：(1)自动形式化模块，将自然语言翻译为专门设计的GeoNF数据集中定义的形式语言GeoLingua；(2)坐标求解器，使用高效蒙特卡洛优化将形式约束映射到精确坐标。同时提出了基于约束的评估指标来量化结构偏差。

Conclusion: GeoLoom为可解释和可扩展的几何图生成提供了原则性基础，通过形式化转换和符号求解实现了高质量的文本-图形生成。

Abstract: High-quality geometric diagram generation presents both a challenge and an opportunity: it demands strict spatial accuracy while offering well-defined constraints to guide generation. Inspired by recent advances in geometry problem solving that employ formal languages and symbolic solvers for enhanced correctness and interpretability, we propose GeoLoom, a novel framework for text-to-diagram generation in geometric domains. GeoLoom comprises two core components: an autoformalization module that translates natural language into a specifically designed generation-oriented formal language GeoLingua, and a coordinate solver that maps formal constraints to precise coordinates using the efficient Monte Carlo optimization. To support this framework, we introduce GeoNF, a dataset aligning natural language geometric descriptions with formal GeoLingua descriptions. We further propose a constraint-based evaluation metric that quantifies structural deviation, offering mathematically grounded supervision for iterative refinement. Empirical results demonstrate that GeoLoom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in structural fidelity, providing a principled foundation for interpretable and scalable diagram generation.

Abstract: Understanding objects is fundamental to computer vision. Beyond object recognition that provides only a category label as typical output, in-depth object understanding represents a comprehensive perception of an object category, involving its components, appearance characteristics, inter-category relationships, contextual background knowledge, etc. Developing such capability requires sufficient multi-modal data, including visual annotations such as parts, attributes, and co-occurrences for specific tasks, as well as textual knowledge to support high-level tasks like reasoning and question answering. However, these data are generally task-oriented and not systematically organized enough to achieve the expected understanding of object categories. In response, we propose the Visual Knowledge Base that structures multi-modal object knowledge as graphs, and present a construction framework named VisKnow that extracts multi-modal, object-level knowledge for object understanding. This framework integrates enriched aligned text and image-source knowledge with region annotations at both object and part levels through a combination of expert design and large-scale model application. As a specific case study, we construct AnimalKB, a structured animal knowledge base covering 406 animal categories, which contains 22K textual knowledge triplets extracted from encyclopedic documents, 420K images, and corresponding region annotations. A series of experiments showcase how AnimalKB enhances object-level visual tasks such as zero-shot recognition and fine-grained VQA, and serves as challenging benchmarks for knowledge graph completion and part segmentation. Our findings highlight the potential of automatically constructing visual knowledge bases to advance visual understanding and its practical applications.

Abstract: With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-3, these models exhibit strong generalization capabilities. Through transfer learning techniques such as fine-tuning and prompt tuning, they can be adapted to various downstream tasks with minimal parameter adjustments. This approach is particularly common in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). This paper aims to explore the effectiveness of common prompt tuning methods in 3D object detection. We investigate whether a model trained on the large-scale Waymo dataset can serve as a foundation model and adapt to other scenarios within the 3D object detection field. This paper sequentially examines the impact of prompt tokens and prompt generators, and further proposes a Scene-Oriented Prompt Pool (\textbf{SOP$^2$}). We demonstrate the effectiveness of prompt pools in 3D object detection, with the goal of inspiring future researchers to delve deeper into the potential of prompts in the 3D field.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Modern video codecs have been extensively optimized to preserve perceptual quality, leveraging models of the human visual system. However, in split inference systems-where intermediate features from neural network are transmitted instead of pixel data-these assumptions no longer apply. Intermediate features are abstract, sparse, and task-specific, making perceptual fidelity irrelevant. In this paper, we investigate the use of Versatile Video Coding (VVC) for compressing such features under the MPEG-AI Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) standard. We perform a tool-level analysis to understand the impact of individual coding components on compression efficiency and downstream vision task accuracy. Based on these insights, we propose three lightweight essential VVC profiles-Fast, Faster, and Fastest. The Fast profile provides 2.96% BD-Rate gain while reducing encoding time by 21.8%. Faster achieves a 1.85% BD-Rate gain with a 51.5% speedup. Fastest reduces encoding time by 95.6% with only a 1.71% loss in BD-Rate.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The ability to perform Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning marks a major milestone for multimodal models (MMs), enabling them to solve complex visual reasoning problems. Yet a critical question remains: is such reasoning genuinely grounded in visual evidence and logically coherent? Existing benchmarks emphasize generation but neglect verification, i.e., the capacity to assess whether a reasoning chain is both visually consistent and logically valid. To fill this gap, we introduce MM-CoT, a diagnostic benchmark specifically designed to probe the visual grounding and logical coherence of CoT reasoning in MMs. Instead of generating free-form explanations, models must select the sole event chain that satisfies two orthogonal constraints: (i) visual consistency, ensuring all steps are anchored in observable evidence, and (ii) logical coherence, ensuring causal and commonsense validity. Adversarial distractors are engineered to violate one of these constraints, exposing distinct reasoning failures. We evaluate leading vision-language models on MM-CoT and find that even the most advanced systems struggle, revealing a sharp discrepancy between generative fluency and true reasoning fidelity. MM-CoT shows low correlation with existing benchmarks, confirming that it measures a unique combination of visual grounding and logical reasoning. This benchmark provides a foundation for developing future models that reason not just plausibly, but faithfully and coherently within the visual world.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Accurate three-dimensional perception is essential for modern industrial robotic systems that perform manipulation, inspection, and navigation tasks. RGB-D and stereo vision sensors are widely used for this purpose, but the depth maps they produce are often noisy, incomplete, or biased due to sensor limitations and environmental conditions. Depth completion methods aim to generate dense, reliable depth maps from RGB images and sparse depth input. However, a key limitation in current depth completion pipelines is the unrealistic generation of sparse depth: sparse pixels are typically selected uniformly at random from dense ground-truth depth, ignoring the fact that real sensors exhibit geometry-dependent and spatially nonuniform reliability. In this work, we propose a normal-guided sparse depth sampling strategy that leverages PCA-based surface normal estimation on the RGB-D point cloud to compute a per-pixel depth reliability measure. The sparse depth samples are then drawn according to this reliability distribution. We integrate this sampling method with the Marigold-DC diffusion-based depth completion model and evaluate it on NYU Depth v2 using the standard metrics. Experiments show that our geometry-aware sparse depth improves accuracy, reduces artifacts near edges and discontinuities, and produces more realistic training conditions that better reflect real sensor behavior.

Abstract: The advancement of camera-only Bird's-Eye-View(BEV) perception is currently impeded by a fundamental tension between state-of-the-art performance and on-vehicle deployment tractability. This bottleneck stems from a deep-rooted dependency on computationally prohibitive view transformations and bespoke, platform-specific kernels. This paper introduces FastBEV++, a framework engineered to reconcile this tension, demonstrating that high performance and deployment efficiency can be achieved in unison via two guiding principles: Fast by Algorithm and Deployable by Design. We realize the "Deployable by Design" principle through a novel view transformation paradigm that decomposes the monolithic projection into a standard Index-Gather-Reshape pipeline. Enabled by a deterministic pre-sorting strategy, this transformation is executed entirely with elementary, operator native primitives (e.g Gather, Matrix Multiplication), which eliminates the need for specialized CUDA kernels and ensures fully TensorRT-native portability. Concurrently, our framework is "Fast by Algorithm", leveraging this decomposed structure to seamlessly integrate an end-to-end, depth-aware fusion mechanism. This jointly learned depth modulation, further bolstered by temporal aggregation and robust data augmentation, significantly enhances the geometric fidelity of the BEV representation.Empirical validation on the nuScenes benchmark corroborates the efficacy of our approach. FastBEV++ establishes a new state-of-the-art 0.359 NDS while maintaining exceptional real-time performance, exceeding 134 FPS on automotive-grade hardware (e.g Tesla T4). By offering a solution that is free of custom plugins yet highly accurate, FastBEV++ presents a mature and scalable design philosophy for production autonomous systems.

TL;DR: 为了解决VLMs中视觉patch tokens导致的计算成本问题，论文提出了一种结合连续和离散通道的混合框架，实现了高效的表示学习。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型中视觉patch tokens的二次计算成本过高，传统方法在语义保留和细节保持之间存在平衡难题，需要新的架构设计解决效率-保真度困境。

Method: 提出HTC-VLM混合框架，通过双通道解耦语义和外观：连续通道用于ViT patch表达的细粒度细节，离散通道通过MGVQ量化生成投影到四个token的符号锚点，通过融合和解缠注意力掩码压缩为单个融合token。

Result: 在七个基准测试（GQA、VQAv2、MMBench、MME、POPE、SEED-Bench、ScienceQA-Image）上平均性能保留87.2%，优于81.0%的连续基线，注意力分析显示压缩token优先关注离散锚点。

Conclusion: 混合设计能够有效解决VLMs的效率与保真度权衡问题，促进了可扩展视觉语言模型的发展。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have transformed multimodal reasoning, but feeding hundreds of visual patch tokens into LLMs incurs quadratic computational costs, straining memory and context windows. Traditional approaches face a trade-off: continuous compression dilutes high-level semantics such as object identities, while discrete quantization loses fine-grained details such as textures. We introduce HTC-VLM, a hybrid framework that disentangles semantics and appearance through dual channels, i.e., a continuous pathway for fine-grained details via ViT patches and a discrete pathway for symbolic anchors using MGVQ quantization projected to four tokens. These are fused into a 580-token hybrid sequence and compressed into a single voco token via a disentanglement attention mask and bottleneck, ensuring efficient and grounded representations. HTC-VLM achieves an average performance retention of 87.2 percent across seven benchmarks (GQA, VQAv2, MMBench, MME, POPE, SEED-Bench, ScienceQA-Image), outperforming the leading continuous baseline at 81.0 percent with a 580-to-1 compression ratio. Attention analyses show that the compressed token prioritizes the discrete anchor, validating its semantic guidance. Our work demonstrates that a minimalist hybrid design can resolve the efficiency-fidelity dilemma and advance scalable VLMs.

Abstract: A novel deep hybrid Residual-SwinCA-Net segmentation framework is proposed in the study for addressing such challenges by extracting locally correlated and robust features, incorporating residual CNN modules. Furthermore, for learning global dependencies, Swin Transformer blocks are customized using internal residual pathways, which reinforce gradient stability, refine local patterns, and facilitate global feature fusion. Formerly, for enhancing tissue continuity, ultrasound noise suppressions, and accentuating fine structural transitions Laplacian-of-Gaussian regional operator is applied, and for maintaining the morphological integrity of malignant lesion contours, a boundary-oriented operator has been incorporated. Subsequently, a contraction strategy was applied stage-wise by progressively reducing features-map progressively for capturing scale invariance and enhancing the robustness of structural variability. In addition, each decoder level prior augmentation integrates a new Multi-Scale Channel Attention and Squeezing (MSCAS) module. The MSCAS selectively emphasizes encoder salient maps, retains discriminative global context, and complementary local structures with minimal computational cost while suppressing redundant activations. Finally, the Pixel-Attention module encodes class-relevant spatial cues by adaptively weighing malignant lesion pixels while suppressing background interference. The Residual-SwinCA-Net and existing CNNs/ViTs techniques have been implemented on the publicly available BUSI dataset. The proposed Residual-SwinCA-Net framework outperformed and achieved 99.29% mean accuracy, 98.74% IoU, and 0.9041 Dice for breast lesion segmentation. The proposed Residual-SwinCA-Net framework improves the BUSI lesion diagnostic performance and strengthens timely clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Camera-based temporal 3D object detection has shown impressive results in autonomous driving, with offline models improving accuracy by using future frames. Knowledge distillation (KD) can be an appealing framework for transferring rich information from offline models to online models. However, existing KD methods overlook future frames, as they mainly focus on spatial feature distillation under strict frame alignment or on temporal relational distillation, thereby making it challenging for online models to effectively learn future knowledge. To this end, we propose a sparse query-based approach, Future Temporal Knowledge Distillation (FTKD), which effectively transfers future frame knowledge from an offline teacher model to an online student model. Specifically, we present a future-aware feature reconstruction strategy to encourage the student model to capture future features without strict frame alignment. In addition, we further introduce future-guided logit distillation to leverage the teacher's stable foreground and background context. FTKD is applied to two high-performing 3D object detection baselines, achieving up to 1.3 mAP and 1.3 NDS gains on the nuScenes dataset, as well as the most accurate velocity estimation, without increasing inference cost.

Abstract: Few-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation (FS-3DSeg) aims to segment novel classes with only a few labeled samples. However, existing metric-based prototype learning methods generate prototypes solely from the support set, without considering their relevance to query data. This often results in prototype bias, where prototypes overfit support-specific characteristics and fail to generalize to the query distribution, especially in the presence of distribution shifts, which leads to degraded segmentation performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Query-aware Hub Prototype (QHP) learning method that explicitly models semantic correlations between support and query sets. Specifically, we propose a Hub Prototype Generation (HPG) module that constructs a bipartite graph connecting query and support points, identifies frequently linked support hubs, and generates query-relevant prototypes that better capture cross-set semantics. To further mitigate the influence of bad hubs and ambiguous prototypes near class boundaries, we introduce a Prototype Distribution Optimization (PDO) module, which employs a purity-reweighted contrastive loss to refine prototype representations by pulling bad hubs and outlier prototypes closer to their corresponding class centers. Extensive experiments on S3DIS and ScanNet demonstrate that QHP achieves substantial performance gains over state-of-the-art methods, effectively narrowing the semantic gap between prototypes and query sets in FS-3DSeg.

Abstract: Accurate extrinsic calibration of LiDAR, RADAR, and camera sensors is essential for reliable perception in autonomous vehicles. Still, it remains challenging due to factors such as mechanical vibrations and cumulative sensor drift in dynamic environments. This paper presents RLCNet, a novel end-to-end trainable deep learning framework for the simultaneous online calibration of these multimodal sensors. Validated on real-world datasets, RLCNet is designed for practical deployment and demonstrates robust performance under diverse conditions. To support real-time operation, an online calibration framework is introduced that incorporates a weighted moving average and outlier rejection, enabling dynamic adjustment of calibration parameters with reduced prediction noise and improved resilience to drift. An ablation study highlights the significance of architectural choices, while comparisons with existing methods demonstrate the superior accuracy and robustness of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Egocentric perception enables humans to experience and understand the world directly from their own point of view. Translating exocentric (third-person) videos into egocentric (first-person) videos opens up new possibilities for immersive understanding but remains highly challenging due to extreme camera pose variations and minimal view overlap. This task requires faithfully preserving visible content while synthesizing unseen regions in a geometrically consistent manner. To achieve this, we present EgoX, a novel framework for generating egocentric videos from a single exocentric input. EgoX leverages the pretrained spatio temporal knowledge of large-scale video diffusion models through lightweight LoRA adaptation and introduces a unified conditioning strategy that combines exocentric and egocentric priors via width and channel wise concatenation. Additionally, a geometry-guided self-attention mechanism selectively attends to spatially relevant regions, ensuring geometric coherence and high visual fidelity. Our approach achieves coherent and realistic egocentric video generation while demonstrating strong scalability and robustness across unseen and in-the-wild videos.

Abstract: Recent advances in Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation have achieved impressive perceptual quality and temporal synchronization, yet most models remain appearance-driven, capturing visual-acoustic correlations without considering the physical factors that shape real-world sounds. We present Physics-Aware Video-to-Audio Synthesis (PAVAS), a method that incorporates physical reasoning into a latent diffusion-based V2A generation through the Physics-Driven Audio Adapter (Phy-Adapter). The adapter receives object-level physical parameters estimated by the Physical Parameter Estimator (PPE), which uses a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to infer the moving-object mass and a segmentation-based dynamic 3D reconstruction module to recover its motion trajectory for velocity computation. These physical cues enable the model to synthesize sounds that reflect underlying physical factors. To assess physical realism, we curate VGG-Impact, a benchmark focusing on object-object interactions, and introduce Audio-Physics Correlation Coefficient (APCC), an evaluation metric that measures consistency between physical and auditory attributes. Comprehensive experiments show that PAVAS produces physically plausible and perceptually coherent audio, outperforming existing V2A models in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Abstract: For decades, procedural worlds have been built on procedural noise functions such as Perlin noise, which are fast and infinite, yet fundamentally limited in realism and large-scale coherence. We introduce Terrain Diffusion, an AI-era successor to Perlin noise that bridges the fidelity of diffusion models with the properties that made procedural noise indispensable: seamless infinite extent, seed-consistency, and constant-time random access. At its core is InfiniteDiffusion, a novel algorithm for infinite generation, enabling seamless, real-time synthesis of boundless landscapes. A hierarchical stack of diffusion models couples planetary context with local detail, while a compact Laplacian encoding stabilizes outputs across Earth-scale dynamic ranges. An open-source infinite-tensor framework supports constant-memory manipulation of unbounded tensors, and few-step consistency distillation enables efficient generation. Together, these components establish diffusion models as a practical foundation for procedural world generation, capable of synthesizing entire planets coherently, controllably, and without limits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分布匹配方法局限于欧几里得空间，只能捕获线性结构而忽略真实数据的内在几何特性(如曲率)。高维数据通常位于低维流形上，因此数据集蒸馏需要使蒸馏后的数据流形与原始数据流形对齐。

Method: 提出GeoDM框架，在欧几里得、双曲和球形流形的笛卡尔积空间中操作，通过可学习的曲率和权重参数适应不同几何结构。设计了最优传输损失来增强分布保真度。

Result: 理论分析表明在乘积空间中的几何感知分布匹配比欧几里得对应方法具有更小的泛化误差界。在标准基准测试上的广泛实验显示，该方法优于最先进的数据蒸馏方法，并在各种单几何结构的分布匹配策略中保持有效。

Conclusion: 通过考虑数据的内在几何结构，在乘积空间中进行几何感知的分布匹配能够显著提高数据集蒸馏的效果，为高效模型训练提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize a compact subset of the original data, enabling models trained on it to achieve performance comparable to those trained on the original large dataset. Existing distribution-matching methods are confined to Euclidean spaces, making them only capture linear structures and overlook the intrinsic geometry of real data, e.g., curvature. However, high-dimensional data often lie on low-dimensional manifolds, suggesting that dataset distillation should have the distilled data manifold aligned with the original data manifold. In this work, we propose a geometry-aware distribution-matching framework, called \textbf{GeoDM}, which operates in the Cartesian product of Euclidean, hyperbolic, and spherical manifolds, with flat, hierarchical, and cyclical structures all captured by a unified representation. To adapt to the underlying data geometry, we introduce learnable curvature and weight parameters for three kinds of geometries. At the same time, we design an optimal transport loss to enhance the distribution fidelity. Our theoretical analysis shows that the geometry-aware distribution matching in a product space yields a smaller generalization error bound than the Euclidean counterparts. Extensive experiments conducted on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art data distillation methods and remains effective across various distribution-matching strategies for the single geometries.

Abstract: Teeth landmark detection is a critical task in modern clinical orthodontics. Their precise identification enables advanced diagnostics, facilitates personalized treatment strategies, and supports more effective monitoring of treatment progress in clinical dentistry. However, several significant challenges may arise due to the intricate geometry of individual teeth and the substantial variations observed across different individuals. To address these complexities, the development of advanced techniques, especially through the application of deep learning, is essential for the precise and reliable detection of 3D tooth landmarks. In this context, the 3DTeethLand challenge was held in collaboration with the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer-Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) in 2024, calling for algorithms focused on teeth landmark detection from intraoral 3D scans. This challenge introduced the first publicly available dataset for 3D teeth landmark detection, offering a valuable resource to assess the state-of-the-art methods in this task and encourage the community to provide methodological contributions towards the resolution of their problem with significant clinical implications.

Abstract: Video Motion Magnification (VMM) amplifies subtle macroscopic motions to a perceptible level. Recently, existing mainstream Eulerian approaches address amplification-induced noise via decoupling representation learning such as texture, shape and frequancey schemes, but they still struggle to separate photon noise from true micro-motion when motion displacements are very small. We propose GeoDiffMM, a novel diffusion-based Lagrangian VMM framework conditioned on optical flow as a geometric cue, enabling structurally consistent motion magnification. Specifically, we design a Noise-free Optical Flow Augmentation strategy that synthesizes diverse nonrigid motion fields without photon noise as supervision, helping the model learn more accurate geometry-aware optial flow and generalize better. Next, we develop a Diffusion Motion Magnifier that conditions the denoising process on (i) optical flow as a geometry prior and (ii) a learnable magnification factor controlling magnitude, thereby selectively amplifying motion components consistent with scene semantics and structure while suppressing content-irrelevant perturbations. Finally, we perform Flow-based Video Synthesis to map the amplified motion back to the image domain with high fidelity. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets show that GeoDiffMM outperforms state-of-the-art methods and significantly improves motion magnification.

Abstract: Input features are conventionally represented as vectors, matrices, or third order tensors in the real field, for color image classification. Inspired by the success of quaternion data modeling for color images in image recovery and denoising tasks, we propose a novel classification method for color image classification, named as the Low-rank Support Quaternion Matrix Machine (LSQMM), in which the RGB channels are treated as pure quaternions to effectively preserve the intrinsic coupling relationships among channels via the quaternion algebra. For the purpose of promoting low-rank structures resulting from strongly correlated color channels, a quaternion nuclear norm regularization term, serving as a natural extension of the conventional matrix nuclear norm to the quaternion domain, is added to the hinge loss in our LSQMM model. An Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based iterative algorithm is designed to effectively resolve the proposed quaternion optimization model. Experimental results on multiple color image classification datasets demonstrate that our proposed classification approach exhibits advantages in classification accuracy, robustness and computational efficiency, compared to several state-of-the-art methods using support vector machines, support matrix machines, and support tensor machines.

Abstract: Recent image protection mechanisms such as Glaze and Nightshade introduce imperceptible, adversarially designed perturbations intended to disrupt downstream text-to-image generative models. While their empirical effectiveness is known, the internal structure, detectability, and representational behavior of these perturbations remain poorly understood. This study provides a systematic, explainable AI analysis using a unified framework that integrates white-box feature-space inspection and black-box signal-level probing. Through latent-space clustering, feature-channel activation analysis, occlusion-based spatial sensitivity mapping, and frequency-domain characterization, we show that protection mechanisms operate as structured, low-entropy perturbations tightly coupled to underlying image content across representational, spatial, and spectral domains. Protected images preserve content-driven feature organization with protection-specific substructure rather than inducing global representational drift. Detectability is governed by interacting effects of perturbation entropy, spatial deployment, and frequency alignment, with sequential protection amplifying detectable structure rather than suppressing it. Frequency-domain analysis shows that Glaze and Nightshade redistribute energy along dominant image-aligned frequency axes rather than introducing diffuse noise. These findings indicate that contemporary image protection operates through structured feature-level deformation rather than semantic dislocation, explaining why protection signals remain visually subtle yet consistently detectable. This work advances the interpretability of adversarial image protection and informs the design of future defenses and detection strategies for generative AI systems.

Abstract: Self-supervised representation learning has shown significant improvement in Natural Language Processing and 2D Computer Vision. However, existing methods face difficulties in representing 3D data because of its unordered and uneven density. Through an in-depth analysis of mainstream contrastive and generative approaches, we find that contrastive models tend to suffer from overfitting, while 3D Mask Autoencoders struggle to handle unordered point clouds. This motivates us to learn 3D representations by sharing the merits of diffusion and contrast models, which is non-trivial due to the pattern difference between the two paradigms. In this paper, we propose \textit{PointDico}, a novel model that seamlessly integrates these methods. \textit{PointDico} learns from both denoising generative modeling and cross-modal contrastive learning through knowledge distillation, where the diffusion model serves as a guide for the contrastive model. We introduce a hierarchical pyramid conditional generator for multi-scale geometric feature extraction and employ a dual-channel design to effectively integrate local and global contextual information. \textit{PointDico} achieves a new state-of-the-art in 3D representation learning, \textit{e.g.}, \textbf{94.32\%} accuracy on ScanObjectNN, \textbf{86.5\%} Inst. mIoU on ShapeNetPart.

Conclusion: MELLA数据集通过双源策略有效提升MLLM在低资源语言环境下的文化意识和语言能力

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable performance in high-resource languages. However, their effectiveness diminishes significantly in the contexts of low-resource languages. Current multilingual enhancement methods are often limited to text modality or rely solely on machine translation. While such approaches help models acquire basic linguistic capabilities and produce "thin descriptions", they neglect the importance of multimodal informativeness and cultural groundedness, both of which are crucial for serving low-resource language users effectively. To bridge this gap, in this study, we identify two significant objectives for a truly effective MLLM in low-resource language settings, namely 1) linguistic capability and 2) cultural groundedness, placing special emphasis on cultural awareness. To achieve these dual objectives, we propose a dual-source strategy that guides the collection of data tailored to each goal, sourcing native web alt-text for culture and MLLM-generated captions for linguistics. As a concrete implementation, we introduce MELLA, a multimodal, multilingual dataset. Experiment results show that after fine-tuning on MELLA, there is a general performance improvement for the eight languages on various MLLM backbones, with models producing "thick descriptions". We verify that the performance gains are from both cultural knowledge enhancement and linguistic capability enhancement. Our dataset can be found at https://opendatalab.com/applyMultilingualCorpus.

Abstract: Pansharpening aims to fuse a high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) image with a low-resolution multispectral (LRMS) image to generate a high-resolution multispectral image (HRMS). Conventional deep learning-based methods are inherently limited in their ability to adapt to regional heterogeneity within feature representations. Although various adaptive convolution methods have been proposed to address this limitation, they often suffer from excessive computational costs and a limited ability to capture heterogeneous regions in remote sensing images effectively. To overcome these challenges, we propose Bimodal Bi-Adaptive Mask-Aware Convolution (Bi^2MAC), which effectively exploits information from different types of regions while intelligently allocating computational resources. Specifically, we design a lightweight module to generate both soft and hard masks, which are used to modulate the input features preliminarily and to guide different types of regions into separate processing branches, respectively. Redundant features are directed to a compact branch for low-cost global processing. In contrast, heterogeneous features are routed to a focused branch that invests more computational resources for fine-grained modeling. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Bi^2MAC achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while requiring substantially lower training time and parameter counts, and the minimal computational cost among adaptive convolution models.

Abstract: Rendering complex reflection of real-world scenes using 3D Gaussian splatting has been a quite promising solution for photorealistic novel view synthesis, but still faces bottlenecks especially in rendering speed and memory storage. This paper proposes a new Hybrid Splatting(HybridSplat) mechanism for Gaussian primitives. Our key idea is a new reflection-baked Gaussian tracing, which bakes the view-dependent reflection within each Gaussian primitive while rendering the reflection using tile-based Gaussian splatting. Then we integrate the reflective Gaussian primitives with base Gaussian primitives using a unified hybrid splatting framework for high-fidelity scene reconstruction. Moreover, we further introduce a pipeline-level acceleration for the hybrid splatting, and reflection-sensitive Gaussian pruning to reduce the model size, thus achieving much faster rendering speed and lower memory storage while preserving the reflection rendering quality. By extensive evaluation, our HybridSplat accelerates about 7x rendering speed across complex reflective scenes from Ref-NeRF, NeRF-Casting with 4x fewer Gaussian primitives than similar ray-tracing based Gaussian splatting baselines, serving as a new state-of-the-art method especially for complex reflective scenes.

Abstract: Generating BOLD images from T1w images offers a promising solution for recovering missing BOLD information and enabling downstream tasks when BOLD images are corrupted or unavailable. Motivated by this, we propose DINO-BOLDNet, a DINOv3-guided multi-slice attention framework that integrates a frozen self-supervised DINOv3 encoder with a lightweight trainable decoder. The model uses DINOv3 to extract within-slice structural representations, and a separate slice-attention module to fuse contextual information across neighboring slices. A multi-scale generation decoder then restores fine-grained functional contrast, while a DINO-based perceptual loss encourages structural and textural consistency between predictions and ground-truth BOLD in the transformer feature space. Experiments on a clinical dataset of 248 subjects show that DINO-BOLDNet surpasses a conditional GAN baseline in both PSNR and MS-SSIM. To our knowledge, this is the first framework capable of generating mean BOLD images directly from T1w images, highlighting the potential of self-supervised transformer guidance for structural-to-functional mapping.

Abstract: Monocular 3D tracking aims to capture the long-term motion of pixels in 3D space from a single monocular video and has witnessed rapid progress in recent years. However, we argue that the existing monocular 3D tracking methods still fall short in separating the camera motion from foreground dynamic motion and cannot densely track newly emerging dynamic subjects in the videos. To address these two limitations, we propose TrackingWorld, a novel pipeline for dense 3D tracking of almost all pixels within a world-centric 3D coordinate system. First, we introduce a tracking upsampler that efficiently lifts the arbitrary sparse 2D tracks into dense 2D tracks. Then, to generalize the current tracking methods to newly emerging objects, we apply the upsampler to all frames and reduce the redundancy of 2D tracks by eliminating the tracks in overlapped regions. Finally, we present an efficient optimization-based framework to back-project dense 2D tracks into world-centric 3D trajectories by estimating the camera poses and the 3D coordinates of these 2D tracks. Extensive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our system achieves accurate and dense 3D tracking in a world-centric coordinate frame.

Abstract: Fire has long been linked to human life, causing severe disasters and losses. Early detection is crucial, and with the rise of home IoT technologies, household fire detection systems have emerged. However, the lack of sufficient fire datasets limits the performance of detection models. We propose the SCU-CGAN model, which integrates U-Net, CBAM, and an additional discriminator to generate realistic fire images from nonfire images. We evaluate the image quality and confirm that SCU-CGAN outperforms existing models. Specifically, SCU-CGAN achieved a 41.5% improvement in KID score compared to CycleGAN, demonstrating the superior quality of the generated fire images. Furthermore, experiments demonstrate that the augmented dataset significantly improves the accuracy of fire detection models without altering their structure. For the YOLOv5 nano model, the most notable improvement was observed in the mAP@0.5:0.95 metric, which increased by 56.5%, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs中视觉token和文本token的norm差异导致非对称更新动态，影响跨模态融合；通过在视觉投影器后添加LayerNorm层可显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型普遍采用Pre-Norm架构，但该架构存在视觉token高范数、文本token低范数的不平衡问题，这导致跨模态特征融合效果不佳。作者旨在解决这一架构性缺陷。

Method: 首先通过理论分析揭示norm差异引起的非对称更新动态（高范数视觉token具有'表征惯性'，更新更慢）。基于此，提出在视觉投影器后添加一个经过精心初始化的LayerNorm层，以实现视觉和文本token的范数对齐。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5架构上的实验表明，该简单干预不仅在一系列多模态基准测试上带来了显著的性能提升，而且在纯文本评测（如MMLU）上也表现出改进，说明该方法能更全面地提升模型能力。

Conclusion: 多模态模型中的norm不平衡是一个关键但常被忽视的问题，对其进行对齐的简单架构修改（添加LayerNorm）能有效提升模型性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), which couple pre-trained vision encoders and language models, have shown remarkable capabilities. However, their reliance on the ubiquitous Pre-Norm architecture introduces a subtle yet critical flaw: a severe norm disparity between the high-norm visual tokens and the low-norm text tokens. In this work, we present a formal theoretical analysis demonstrating that this imbalance is not a static issue. Instead, it induces an ``asymmetric update dynamic,'' where high-norm visual tokens exhibit a ``representational inertia,'' causing them to transform semantically much slower than their textual counterparts. This fundamentally impairs effective cross-modal feature fusion. Our empirical validation across a range of mainstream MLLMs confirms that this theoretical dynamic -- the persistence of norm disparity and the resulting asymmetric update rates -- is a prevalent phenomenon. Based on this insight, we propose a remarkably simple yet effective solution: inserting a single, carefully initialized LayerNorm layer after the visual projector to enforce norm alignment. Experiments conducted on the LLaVA-1.5 architecture show that this intervention yields significant performance gains not only on a wide suite of multimodal benchmarks but also, notably, on text-only evaluations such as MMLU, suggesting that resolving the architectural imbalance leads to a more holistically capable model.

Motivation: 复杂光照条件下捕获的图像常出现各种退化，影响视觉应用性能。现有方法要么显著放大固有噪声，要么只在特定光照条件下有效，需要同时处理增强和噪声抑制的通用解决方案。

Method: 1. 使用梯度域加权引导滤波(GDWGIF)精确估计光照并提升图像质量；2. 通过Retinex模型将图像分解为光照层和反射层；3. 并行处理两图层：光照层进行校正以优化光照，反射层进行增强；4. 通过多曝光融合和线性拉伸策略优化图像动态范围。

Result: 在真实应用场景的数据集上进行评估，实验结果表明该方法在对比度增强和噪声抑制方面均优于当前最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 该框架能有效处理复杂光照条件下的图像退化问题，实现了同时增强图像对比度和抑制噪声的良好平衡，在实际应用中具有优越性能。

Abstract: Under challenging light conditions, captured images often suffer from various degradations, leading to a decline in the performance of vision-based applications. Although numerous methods have been proposed to enhance image quality, they either significantly amplify inherent noise or are only effective under specific illumination conditions. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework for simultaneous enhancement and noise suppression under complex illumination conditions. Firstly, a gradient-domain weighted guided filter (GDWGIF) is employed to accurately estimate illumination and improve image quality. Next, the Retinex model is applied to decompose the captured image into separate illumination and reflection layers. These layers undergo parallel processing, with the illumination layer being corrected to optimize lighting conditions and the reflection layer enhanced to improve image quality. Finally, the dynamic range of the image is optimized through multi-exposure fusion and a linear stretching strategy. The proposed method is evaluated on real-world datasets obtained from practical applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves better performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in both contrast enhancement and noise suppression.

Abstract: Facial retouching to beautify images is widely spread in social media, advertisements, and it is even applied in professional photo studios to let individuals appear younger, remove wrinkles and skin impurities. Generally speaking, this is done to enhance beauty. This is not a problem itself, but when retouched images are used as biometric samples and enrolled in a biometric system, it is one. Since previous work has proven facial retouching to be a challenge for face recognition systems,the detection of facial retouching becomes increasingly necessary. This work proposes to study and analyze changes in beauty assessment algorithms of retouched images, assesses different feature extraction methods based on artificial intelligence in order to improve retouching detection, and evaluates whether face beauty can be exploited to enhance the detection rate. In a scenario where the attacking retouching algorithm is unknown, this work achieved 1.1% D-EER on single image detection.

Conclusion: 提出的训练免费框架有效解决了视频中人体网格恢复的时序一致性问题，提升了遮挡条件下的性能表现。

Abstract: Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) aims to reconstruct 3D human pose and shape from 2D observations and is fundamental to human-centric understanding in real-world scenarios. While recent image-based HMR methods such as SAM 3D Body achieve strong robustness on in-the-wild images, they rely on per-frame inference when applied to videos, leading to temporal inconsistency and degraded performance under occlusions. We address these issues without extra training by leveraging the inherent human continuity in videos. We propose SAM-Body4D, a training-free framework for temporally consistent and occlusion-robust HMR from videos. We first generate identity-consistent masklets using a promptable video segmentation model, then refine them with an Occlusion-Aware module to recover missing regions. The refined masklets guide SAM 3D Body to produce consistent full-body mesh trajectories, while a padding-based parallel strategy enables efficient multi-human inference. Experimental results demonstrate that SAM-Body4D achieves improved temporal stability and robustness in challenging in-the-wild videos, without any retraining.

Conclusion: OneClip-RAG在保持效率的同时有效解决了MLLMs的长视频处理瓶颈，展示了其在长视频理解任务中的优越性。

Abstract: Due to excessive memory overhead, most Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can only process videos of limited frames. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient paradigm to remedy this shortcoming, termed One-shot video-Clip based Retrieval AuGmentation (OneClip-RAG). Compared with existing video RAG methods, OneClip-RAG makes full use of the merits of video clips for augmented video understanding in terms of both knowledge integrity and semantic coherence. Besides, it is also equipped with a novel query-guided video chunking algorithm that can unify clip chunking and cross-modal retrieval in one processing step, avoiding redundant computations. To improve instruction following, we further propose a new dataset called SynLongVideo and design a progressive training regime for OneClip-RAG. OneClip-RAG is plugged into five recent MLLMs and validated on a set of long-video benchmarks. Experimental results not only show the obvious performance gains by OneClip-RAG over MLLMs, e.g., boosting InternLV2 8B and Qwen2-VL 7B to the level of GPT-4o on MLVU, but also show its superior efficiency in handling long videos. e.g., enabling LLaVA-Video understand up to an hour of videos in less than 2.2 minutes on a single 4090 GPU.

Abstract: Accurately recovering 6D poses in densely packed industrial bin-picking environments remain a serious challenge, owing to occlusions, reflections, and textureless parts. We introduce a holistic depth-only 6D pose estimation approach that fuses multi-view depth maps into either a fine-grained 3D point cloud in its vanilla version, or a sparse Truncated Signed Distance Field (TSDF). At the core of our framework lies a staged heatmap mechanism that yields scene-adaptive attention priors across different resolutions, steering computation toward foreground regions, thus keeping memory requirements at high resolutions feasible. Along, we propose a density-aware sparse transformer block that dynamically attends to (self-) occlusions and the non-uniform distribution of 3D data. While sparse 3D approaches has proven effective for long-range perception, its potential in close-range robotic applications remains underexplored. Our framework operates fully sparse, enabling high-resolution volumetric representations to capture fine geometric details crucial for accurate pose estimation in clutter. Our method processes the entire scene integrally, predicting the 6D pose via a novel per-voxel voting strategy, allowing simultaneous pose predictions for an arbitrary number of target objects. We validate our method on the recently published IPD and MV-YCB multi-view datasets, demonstrating competitive performance in heavily cluttered industrial and household bin picking scenarios.

Abstract: Surgical segmentation is pivotal for scene understanding yet remains hindered by annotation scarcity and semantic inconsistency across diverse procedures. Existing approaches typically fine-tune natural foundation models (e.g., SAM) with limited supervision, functioning merely as domain adapters rather than surgical foundation models. Consequently, they struggle to generalize across the vast variability of surgical targets. To bridge this gap, we present LapFM, a foundation model designed to evolve robust segmentation capabilities from massive unlabeled surgical images. Distinct from medical foundation models relying on inefficient self-supervised proxy tasks, LapFM leverages a Hierarchical Concept Evolving Pre-training paradigm. First, we establish a Laparoscopic Concept Hierarchy (LCH) via a hierarchical mask decoder with parent-child query embeddings, unifying diverse entities (i.e., Anatomy, Tissue, and Instrument) into a scalable knowledge structure with cross-granularity semantic consistency. Second, we propose a Confidence-driven Evolving Labeling that iteratively generates and filters pseudo-labels based on hierarchical consistency, progressively incorporating reliable samples from unlabeled images into training. This process yields LapBench-114K, a large-scale benchmark comprising 114K image-mask pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LapFM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing new standards for granularity-adaptive generalization in universal laparoscopic segmentation.

Motivation: 现有的快照式多光谱成像系统虽然能提供比传统RGB传感器更丰富的光谱信息，但大多数现有方法将色彩校正流程分割为多个独立阶段，往往在早期就丢弃了多光谱数据，限制了性能提升。

Method: 设计了一个端到端的统一学习框架，将完整的色彩校正流程集成在单个模型中，能同时处理高分辨率RGB和低分辨率多光谱数据。框架采用两种不同的图像到图像架构进行重构，并通过收集和重新调整公开光谱数据集构建专用训练数据集。

Conclusion: 该统一的端到端学习框架通过有效利用多光谱信息，在色彩校正任务上取得了显著改进，具有灵活性和通用性，相关数据集、代码和模型将在论文接受后公开。

Abstract: Recent advances in snapshot multispectral (MS) imaging have enabled compact, low-cost spectral sensors for consumer and mobile devices. By capturing richer spectral information than conventional RGB sensors, these systems can enhance key imaging tasks, including color correction. However, most existing methods treat the color correction pipeline in separate stages, often discarding MS data early in the process. We propose a unified, learning-based framework that (i) performs end-to-end color correction and (ii) jointly leverages data from a high-resolution RGB sensor and an auxiliary low-resolution MS sensor. Our approach integrates the full pipeline within a single model, producing coherent and color-accurate outputs. We demonstrate the flexibility and generality of our framework by refactoring two different state-of-the-art image-to-image architectures. To support training and evaluation, we construct a dedicated dataset by aggregating and repurposing publicly available spectral datasets, rendering under multiple RGB camera sensitivities. Extensive experiments show that our approach improves color accuracy and stability, reducing error by up to 50% compared to RGB-only and MS-driven baselines. Datasets, code, and models will be made available upon acceptance.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前基于子集的解释方法的局限性，展示了不确定性驱动优化如何增强视觉模型的归因解释和对象级可解释性，为现实世界视觉应用中更透明、可信赖的AI铺平了道路。

Abstract: Subset selection-based methods are widely used to explain deep vision models: they attribute predictions by highlighting the most influential image regions and support object-level explanations. While these methods perform well in in-distribution (ID) settings, their behavior under out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions remains poorly understood. Through extensive experiments across multiple ID-OOD sets, we find that reliability of the existing subset based methods degrades markedly, yielding redundant, unstable, and uncertainty-sensitive explanations. To address these shortcomings, we introduce a framework that combines submodular subset selection with layer-wise, gradient-based uncertainty estimation to improve robustness and fidelity without requiring additional training or auxiliary models. Our approach estimates uncertainty via adaptive weight perturbations and uses these estimates to guide submodular optimization, ensuring diverse and informative subset selection. Empirical evaluations show that, beyond mitigating the weaknesses of existing methods under OOD scenarios, our framework also yields improvements in ID settings. These findings highlight limitations of current subset-based approaches and demonstrate how uncertainty-driven optimization can enhance attribution and object-level interpretability, paving the way for more transparent and trustworthy AI in real-world vision applications.

Motivation: 足球运动员追踪面临频繁遮挡、相似外观和拥挤场景中快速移动等挑战，需要精确的初始化和鲁棒的再识别机制来改进遮挡恢复。

Method: 提出基于团队的追踪系统，使用SAM进行精确初始化，HSV直方图进行再识别，结合CSRT跟踪器和球衣颜色外观模型。

Result: 在足球视频序列上达到7.6-7.7 FPS，内存使用稳定（约1880MB）。轻度遮挡下追踪成功率100%，拥挤罚球区场景（5名以上球员）成功率90%，重度遮挡下通过外观再识别恢复50%的追踪。

Conclusion: SAM+CSRT组合在不同人群密度下表现一致，但对长时间离画面遮挡（仅有8.66%重识别成功率）处理不足，需要更强再识别机制。研究为资源受限下足球追踪系统部署提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Football player tracking is challenged by frequent occlusions, similar appearances, and rapid motion in crowded scenes. This paper presents a lightweight SAM-based tracking method combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with CSRT trackers and jersey color-based appearance models. We propose a team-aware tracking system that uses SAM for precise initialization and HSV histogram-based re-identification to improve occlusion recovery. Our evaluation measures three dimensions: processing speed (FPS and memory), tracking accuracy (success rate and box stability), and robustness (occlusion recovery and identity consistency). Experiments on football video sequences show that the approach achieves 7.6-7.7 FPS with stable memory usage (~1880 MB), maintaining 100 percent tracking success in light occlusions and 90 percent in crowded penalty-box scenarios with 5 or more players. Appearance-based re-identification recovers 50 percent of heavy occlusions, demonstrating the value of domain-specific cues. Analysis reveals key trade-offs: the SAM + CSRT combination provides consistent performance across crowd densities but struggles with long-term occlusions where players leave the frame, achieving only 8.66 percent re-acquisition success. These results offer practical guidelines for deploying football tracking systems under resource constraints, showing that classical tracker-based methods work well with continuous visibility but require stronger re-identification mechanisms for extended absences.

Conclusion: ContextDrag通过有效利用参考图像的上下文信息，实现了更精确的拖拽控制和更好的语义及纹理一致性，代码将公开可用。

Abstract: Drag-based image editing aims to modify visual content followed by user-specified drag operations. Despite existing methods having made notable progress, they still fail to fully exploit the contextual information in the reference image, including fine-grained texture details, leading to edits with limited coherence and fidelity. To address this challenge, we introduce ContextDrag, a new paradigm for drag-based editing that leverages the strong contextual modeling capability of editing models, such as FLUX-Kontext. By incorporating VAE-encoded features from the reference image, ContextDrag can leverage rich contextual cues and preserve fine-grained details, without the need for finetuning or inversion. Specifically, ContextDrag introduced a novel Context-preserving Token Injection (CTI) that injects noise-free reference features into their correct destination locations via a Latent-space Reverse Mapping (LRM) algorithm. This strategy enables precise drag control while preserving consistency in both semantics and texture details. Second, ContextDrag adopts a novel Position-Consistent Attention (PCA), which positional re-encodes the reference tokens and applies overlap-aware masking to eliminate interference from irrelevant reference features. Extensive experiments on DragBench-SR and DragBench-DR demonstrate that our approach surpasses all existing SOTA methods. Code will be publicly available.

Abstract: Neural rendering, particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), has evolved rapidly and become a key component for building world models. However, existing viewer solutions remain fragmented, heavy, or constrained by legacy pipelines, resulting in high deployment friction and limited support for dynamic content and generative models. In this work, we present Visionary, an open, web-native platform for real-time various Gaussian Splatting and meshes rendering. Built on an efficient WebGPU renderer with per-frame ONNX inference, Visionary enables dynamic neural processing while maintaining a lightweight, "click-to-run" browser experience. It introduces a standardized Gaussian Generator contract, which not only supports standard 3DGS rendering but also allows plug-and-play algorithms to generate or update Gaussians each frame. Such inference also enables us to apply feedforward generative post-processing. The platform further offers a plug in three.js library with a concise TypeScript API for seamless integration into existing web applications. Experiments show that, under identical 3DGS assets, Visionary achieves superior rendering efficiency compared to current Web viewers due to GPU-based primitive sorting. It already supports multiple variants, including MLP-based 3DGS, 4DGS, neural avatars, and style transformation or enhancement networks. By unifying inference and rendering directly in the browser, Visionary significantly lowers the barrier to reproduction, comparison, and deployment of 3DGS-family methods, serving as a unified World Model Carrier for both reconstructive and generative paradigms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型通常只评估最终生成结果，但生成过程沿时间轨迹展开，理解这一动态过程对分析模型的可控性、可靠性和可预测性至关重要。本文旨在研究噪声何时转变为特定概念（如年龄）并锁定去噪轨迹。

Method: 提出PCI框架，这是一种无需训练、模型无关的方法，通过概念插入成功率（CIS）来分析扩散时间内的概念动态。CIS定义为在给定时间步插入的概念被保留并反映在最终图像中的概率。

Result: 应用于多个最先进的文本到图像扩散模型和广泛的概念分类，PCI揭示了扩散模型间多样的时序行为，某些轨迹阶段对特定概念更为有利。这些发现为文本驱动图像编辑提供了可操作的见解，指出了最有效的干预时机。

Conclusion: PCI框架提供了一种分析扩散模型概念动态的新方法，无需访问模型内部或进行训练，就能识别最佳的编辑干预时机，在语义准确性和内容保持之间取得良好平衡，为可控图像生成提供了实用工具。

Abstract: Diffusion models are usually evaluated by their final outputs, gradually denoising random noise into meaningful images. Yet, generation unfolds along a trajectory, and analyzing this dynamic process is crucial for understanding how controllable, reliable, and predictable these models are in terms of their success/failure modes. In this work, we ask the question: when does noise turn into a specific concept (e.g., age) and lock in the denoising trajectory? We propose PCI (Prompt-Conditioned Intervention) to study this question. PCI is a training-free and model-agnostic framework for analyzing concept dynamics through diffusion time. The central idea is the analysis of Concept Insertion Success (CIS), defined as the probability that a concept inserted at a given timestep is preserved and reflected in the final image, offering a way to characterize the temporal dynamics of concept formation. Applied to several state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models and a broad taxonomy of concepts, PCI reveals diverse temporal behaviors across diffusion models, in which certain phases of the trajectory are more favorable to specific concepts even within the same concept type. These findings also provide actionable insights for text-driven image editing, highlighting when interventions are most effective without requiring access to model internals or training, and yielding quantitatively stronger edits that achieve a balance of semantic accuracy and content preservation than strong baselines.

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled efficient free-viewpoint rendering and photorealistic scene reconstruction. While on-the-fly extensions of 3DGS have shown promise for real-time reconstruction from monocular RGB streams, they often fail to achieve complete 3D coverage due to the limited field of view (FOV). Employing a multi-camera rig fundamentally addresses this limitation. In this paper, we present the first on-the-fly 3D reconstruction framework for multi-camera rigs. Our method incrementally fuses dense RGB streams from multiple overlapping cameras into a unified Gaussian representation, achieving drift-free trajectory estimation and efficient online reconstruction. We propose a hierarchical camera initialization scheme that enables coarse inter-camera alignment without calibration, followed by a lightweight multi-camera bundle adjustment that stabilizes trajectories while maintaining real-time performance. Furthermore, we introduce a redundancy-free Gaussian sampling strategy and a frequency-aware optimization scheduler to reduce the number of Gaussian primitives and the required optimization iterations, thereby maintaining both efficiency and reconstruction fidelity. Our method reconstructs hundreds of meters of 3D scenes within just 2 minutes using only raw multi-camera video streams, demonstrating unprecedented speed, robustness, and Fidelity for on-the-fly 3D scene reconstruction.

TL;DR: 本文提出ReasonBreak对抗框架，通过概念感知扰动破坏多模态大语言模型的层次推理过程，以保护用户图像中的地理位置隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐私保护技术主要针对感知模型，无法应对多模态大推理模型（MLRMs）通过多层次链式推理分析环境线索来推断精确地理位置的能力，这带来了严重的隐私风险。

Method: 提出ReasonBreak对抗框架，基于"有效破坏地理推理需要与概念层次对齐的扰动而非均匀噪声"的洞见，通过针对推理链中的关键概念依赖性生成概念感知扰动，使特定推理步骤失效并级联影响后续推理。还贡献了包含6,341张超高清图像的GeoPrivacy-6K数据集，带有层次概念标注。

Result: 在7个最先进的MLRMs（包括GPT-o3、GPT-5、Gemini 2.5 Pro）上的广泛评估表明，ReasonBreak在区域级保护上提升了14.4%（33.8% vs 19.4%），在街区级保护上几乎翻倍（33.5% vs 16.8%），表现出卓越效果。

Conclusion: 这项研究为防御基于推理的隐私威胁建立了新范式，证明针对概念层次的对抗扰动能有效保护用户图像的地理位置隐私。

Abstract: Multi-modal large reasoning models (MLRMs) pose significant privacy risks by inferring precise geographic locations from personal images through hierarchical chain-of-thought reasoning. Existing privacy protection techniques, primarily designed for perception-based models, prove ineffective against MLRMs' sophisticated multi-step reasoning processes that analyze environmental cues. We introduce \textbf{ReasonBreak}, a novel adversarial framework specifically designed to disrupt hierarchical reasoning in MLRMs through concept-aware perturbations. Our approach is founded on the key insight that effective disruption of geographic reasoning requires perturbations aligned with conceptual hierarchies rather than uniform noise. ReasonBreak strategically targets critical conceptual dependencies within reasoning chains, generating perturbations that invalidate specific inference steps and cascade through subsequent reasoning stages. To facilitate this approach, we contribute \textbf{GeoPrivacy-6K}, a comprehensive dataset comprising 6,341 ultra-high-resolution images ($\geq$2K) with hierarchical concept annotations. Extensive evaluation across seven state-of-the-art MLRMs (including GPT-o3, GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro) demonstrates ReasonBreak's superior effectiveness, achieving a 14.4\% improvement in tract-level protection (33.8\% vs 19.4\%) and nearly doubling block-level protection (33.5\% vs 16.8\%). This work establishes a new paradigm for privacy protection against reasoning-based threats.

Motivation: 现有条件扩散模型存在语义不对齐和幻觉问题，传统方法需要在生成完成后评估对齐性，计算成本高且无法实时检测

Method: 使用NoisyCLIP在反向扩散过程的隐空间测量语义对齐，首次探索使用双编码器在图像生成过程中检测提示到隐空间的对齐性

Result: 在BoN设置中，NoisyCLIP减少50%计算成本，达到98%的CLIP对齐性能，支持实时对齐评估

Conclusion: NoisyCLIP能够在生成过程中早期检测文本-图像不对齐，实现实时对齐评估，降低计算成本同时保持语义保真度

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models rely on language-to-image alignment methods to steer the generation towards semantically accurate outputs. Despite the success of this architecture, misalignment and hallucinations remain common issues and require automatic misalignment detection tools to improve quality, for example by applying them in a Best-of-N (BoN) post-generation setting. Unfortunately, measuring the alignment after the generation is an expensive step since we need to wait for the overall generation to finish to determine prompt adherence. In contrast, this work hypothesizes that text/image misalignments can be detected early in the denoising process, enabling real-time alignment assessment without waiting for the complete generation. In particular, we propose NoisyCLIP a method that measures semantic alignment in the noisy latent space. This work is the first to explore and benchmark prompt-to-latent misalignment detection during image generation using dual encoders in the reverse diffusion process. We evaluate NoisyCLIP qualitatively and quantitatively and find it reduces computational cost by 50% while achieving 98% of CLIP alignment performance in BoN settings. This approach enables real-time alignment assessment during generation, reducing costs without sacrificing semantic fidelity.

Abstract: A major challenge in reconstructing buildings from LiDAR point clouds lies in accurately capturing building surfaces under varying point densities and noise interference. To flexibly gather high-quality 3D profiles of the building in diverse resolution, we propose OCCDiff applying latent diffusion in the occupancy function space. Our OCCDiff combines a latent diffusion process with a function autoencoder architecture to generate continuous occupancy functions evaluable at arbitrary locations. Moreover, a point encoder is proposed to provide condition features to diffusion learning, constraint the final occupancy prediction for occupancy decoder, and insert multi-modal features for latent generation to latent encoder. To further enhance the model performance, a multi-task training strategy is employed, ensuring that the point encoder learns diverse and robust feature representations. Empirical results show that our method generates physically consistent samples with high fidelity to the target distribution and exhibits robustness to noisy data.

Abstract: Thinking-with-images paradigms have showcased remarkable visual reasoning capability by integrating visual information as dynamic elements into the Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, optimizing interleaved multimodal CoT (iMCoT) through reinforcement learning remains challenging, as it relies on scarce high-quality reasoning data. In this study, we propose Self-Calling Chain-of-Thought (sCoT), a novel visual reasoning paradigm that reformulates iMCoT as a language-only CoT with self-calling. Specifically, a main agent decomposes the complex visual reasoning task to atomic subtasks and invokes its virtual replicas, i.e. parameter-sharing subagents, to solve them in isolated context. sCoT enjoys substantial training effectiveness and efficiency, as it requires no explicit interleaving between modalities. sCoT employs group-relative policy optimization to reinforce effective reasoning behavior to enhance optimization. Experiments on HR-Bench 4K show that sCoT improves the overall reasoning performance by up to $1.9\%$ with $\sim 75\%$ fewer GPU hours compared to strong baseline approaches.

Abstract: GUI grounding, which translates natural language instructions into precise pixel coordinates, is essential for developing practical GUI agents. However, we observe that existing grounding models exhibit significant coordinate prediction instability, minor visual perturbations (e.g. cropping a few pixels) can drastically alter predictions, flipping results between correct and incorrect. This instability severely undermines model performance, especially for samples with high-resolution and small UI elements. To address this issue, we propose Multi-View Prediction (MVP), a training-free framework that enhances grounding performance through multi-view inference. Our key insight is that while single-view predictions may be unstable, aggregating predictions from multiple carefully cropped views can effectively distinguish correct coordinates from outliers. MVP comprises two components: (1) Attention-Guided View Proposal, which derives diverse views guided by instruction-to-image attention scores, and (2) Multi-Coordinates Clustering, which ensembles predictions by selecting the centroid of the densest spatial cluster. Extensive experiments demonstrate MVP's effectiveness across various models and benchmarks. Notably, on ScreenSpot-Pro, MVP boosts UI-TARS-1.5-7B to 56.1%, GTA1-7B to 61.7%, Qwen3VL-8B-Instruct to 65.3%, and Qwen3VL-32B-Instruct to 74.0%.

Abstract: Oil painting, as a high-level medium that blends human abstract thinking with artistic expression, poses substantial challenges for digital generation and editing due to its intricate brushstroke dynamics and stylized characteristics. Existing generation and editing techniques are often constrained by the distribution of training data and primarily focus on modifying real photographs. In this work, we introduce a unified multimodal framework for oil painting generation and editing. The proposed system allows users to incorporate reference images for precise semantic control, hand-drawn sketches for spatial structure alignment, and natural language prompts for high-level semantic guidance, while consistently maintaining a unified painting style across all outputs. Our method achieves interactive oil painting creation through three crucial technical advancements. First, we enhance the training stage with spatial alignment and semantic enhancement conditioning strategy, which map masks and sketches into spatial constraints, and encode contextual embedding from reference images and text into feature constraints, enabling object-level semantic alignment. Second, to overcome data scarcity, we propose a self-supervised style transfer pipeline based on Stroke-Based Rendering (SBR), which simulates the inpainting dynamics of oil painting restoration, converting real images into stylized oil paintings with preserved brushstroke textures to construct a large-scale paired training dataset. Finally, during inference, we integrate features using the AdaIN operator to ensure stylistic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our interactive system enables fine-grained editing while preserving the artistic qualities of oil paintings, achieving an unprecedented level of imagination realization in stylized oil paintings generation and editing.

Abstract: Although recent 3D-native generators have made great progress in synthesizing reliable geometry, they still fall short in achieving realistic appearances. A key obstacle lies in the lack of diverse and high-quality real-world 3D assets with rich texture details, since capturing such data is intrinsically difficult due to the diverse scales of scenes, non-rigid motions of objects, and the limited precision of 3D scanners. We introduce Photo3D, a framework for advancing photorealistic 3D generation, which is driven by the image data generated by the GPT-4o-Image model. Considering that the generated images can distort 3D structures due to their lack of multi-view consistency, we design a structure-aligned multi-view synthesis pipeline and construct a detail-enhanced multi-view dataset paired with 3D geometry. Building on it, we present a realistic detail enhancement scheme that leverages perceptual feature adaptation and semantic structure matching to enforce appearance consistency with realistic details while preserving the structural consistency with the 3D-native geometry. Our scheme is general to different 3D-native generators, and we present dedicated training strategies to facilitate the optimization of geometry-texture coupled and decoupled 3D-native generation paradigms. Experiments demonstrate that Photo3D generalizes well across diverse 3D-native generation paradigms and achieves state-of-the-art photorealistic 3D generation performance.

Abstract: Autoregressive(AR)-diffusion hybrid paradigms combine AR's structured modeling with diffusion's photorealistic synthesis, yet suffer from high latency due to sequential AR generation and iterative denoising. In this work, we tackle this bottleneck and propose a unified AR-diffusion framework Fast-ARDiff that jointly optimizes both components, accelerating AR speculative decoding while simultaneously facilitating faster diffusion decoding. Specifically: (1) The entropy-informed speculative strategy encourages draft model to produce higher-entropy representations aligned with target model's entropy characteristics, mitigating entropy mismatch and high rejection rates caused by draft overconfidence. (2) For diffusion decoding, rather than treating it as an independent module, we integrate it into the same end-to-end framework using a dynamic scheduler that prioritizes AR optimization to guide the diffusion part in further steps. The diffusion part is optimized through a joint distillation framework combining trajectory and distribution matching, ensuring stable training and high-quality synthesis with extremely few steps. During inference, shallow feature entropy from AR module is used to pre-filter low-entropy drafts, avoiding redundant computation and improving latency. Fast-ARDiff achieves state-of-the-art acceleration across diverse models: on ImageNet 256$\times$256, TransDiff attains 4.3$\times$ lossless speedup, and NextStep-1 achieves 3$\times$ acceleration on text-conditioned generation.

Abstract: Color image generation has a wide range of applications, but the existing generation models ignore the correlation among color channels, which may lead to chromatic aberration problems. In addition, the data distribution problem of color images has not been systematically elaborated and explained, so that there is still the lack of the theory about measuring different color images datasets. In this paper, we define a new quaternion Wasserstein distance and develop its dual theory. To deal with the quaternion linear programming problem, we derive the strong duality form with helps of quaternion convex set separation theorem and quaternion Farkas lemma. With using quaternion Wasserstein distance, we propose a novel Wasserstein quaternion generative adversarial network. Experiments demonstrate that this novel model surpasses both the (quaternion) generative adversarial networks and the Wasserstein generative adversarial network in terms of generation efficiency and image quality.

Abstract: Diffusion inversion aims to recover the initial noise corresponding to a given image such that this noise can reconstruct the original image through the denoising diffusion process. The key component of diffusion inversion is to minimize errors at each inversion step, thereby mitigating cumulative inaccuracies. Recently, fixed-point iteration has emerged as a widely adopted approach to minimize reconstruction errors at each inversion step. However, it suffers from high computational costs due to its iterative nature and the complexity of hyperparameter selection. To address these issues, we propose an iteration-free fixed-point estimator for diffusion inversion. First, we derive an explicit expression of the fixed point from an ideal inversion step. Unfortunately, it inherently contains an unknown data prediction error. Building upon this, we introduce the error approximation, which uses the calculable error from the previous inversion step to approximate the unknown error at the current inversion step. This yields a calculable, approximate expression for the fixed point, which is an unbiased estimator characterized by low variance, as shown by our theoretical analysis. We evaluate reconstruction performance on two text-image datasets, NOCAPS and MS-COCO. Compared to DDIM inversion and other inversion methods based on the fixed-point iteration, our method achieves consistent and superior performance in reconstruction tasks without additional iterations or training.

Abstract: Understanding how the human brain represents visual concepts, and in which brain regions these representations are encoded, remains a long-standing challenge. Decades of work have advanced our understanding of visual representations, yet brain signals remain large and complex, and the space of possible visual concepts is vast. As a result, most studies remain small-scale, rely on manual inspection, focus on specific regions and properties, and rarely include systematic validation. We present a large-scale, automated framework for discovering and explaining visual representations across the human cortex. Our method comprises two main stages. First, we discover candidate interpretable patterns in fMRI activity through unsupervised, data-driven decomposition methods. Next, we explain each pattern by identifying the set of natural images that most strongly elicit it and generating a natural-language description of their shared visual meaning. To scale this process, we introduce an automated pipeline that tests multiple candidate explanations, assigns quantitative reliability scores, and selects the most consistent description for each voxel pattern. Our framework reveals thousands of interpretable patterns spanning many distinct visual concepts, including fine-grained representations previously unreported.

Abstract: This paper presents a modular neural image signal processing (ISP) framework that processes raw inputs and renders high-quality display-referred images. Unlike prior neural ISP designs, our method introduces a high degree of modularity, providing full control over multiple intermediate stages of the rendering process.~This modular design not only achieves high rendering accuracy but also improves scalability, debuggability, generalization to unseen cameras, and flexibility to match different user-preference styles. To demonstrate the advantages of this design, we built a user-interactive photo-editing tool that leverages our neural ISP to support diverse editing operations and picture styles. The tool is carefully engineered to take advantage of the high-quality rendering of our neural ISP and to enable unlimited post-editable re-rendering. Our method is a fully learning-based framework with variants of different capacities, all of moderate size (ranging from ~0.5 M to ~3.9 M parameters for the entire pipeline), and consistently delivers competitive qualitative and quantitative results across multiple test sets.

Abstract: Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) enables pre-trained models to adapt to continuously evolving domains. Existing methods have improved robustness but typically rely on fixed or batch-level thresholds, which cannot account for varying difficulty across classes and instances. This limitation is especially problematic in semantic segmentation, where each image requires dense, multi-class predictions. We propose an approach that adaptively adjusts pseudo labels to reflect the confidence distribution within each image and dynamically balances learning toward classes most affected by domain shifts. This fine-grained, class- and instance-aware adaptation produces more reliable supervision and mitigates error accumulation throughout continual adaptation. Extensive experiments across eight CTTA and TTA scenarios, including synthetic-to-real and long-term shifts, show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, setting a new standard for semantic segmentation under evolving conditions.

Abstract: The tumor microenvironment (TME) has emerged as a promising source of prognostic biomarkers. To fully leverage its potential, analysis methods must capture complex interactions between different cell types. We propose HiGINE -- a hierarchical graph-based approach to predict patient survival (short vs. long) from TME characterization in multiplex immunofluorescence (mIF) images and enhance risk stratification in lung cancer. Our model encodes both local and global inter-relations in cell neighborhoods, incorporating information about cell types and morphology. Multimodal fusion, aggregating cancer stage with mIF-derived features, further boosts performance. We validate HiGINE on two public datasets, demonstrating improved risk stratification, robustness, and generalizability.

Abstract: Video recordings of open surgeries are greatly required for education and research purposes. However, capturing unobstructed videos is challenging since surgeons frequently block the camera field of view. To avoid occlusion, the positions and angles of the camera must be frequently adjusted, which is highly labor-intensive. Prior work has addressed this issue by installing multiple cameras on a shadowless lamp and arranging them to fully surround the surgical area. This setup increases the chances of some cameras capturing an unobstructed view. However, manual image alignment is needed in post-processing since camera configurations change every time surgeons move the lamp for optimal lighting. This paper aims to fully automate this alignment task. The proposed method identifies frames in which the lighting system moves, realigns them, and selects the camera with the least occlusion to generate a video that consistently presents the surgical field from a fixed perspective. A user study involving surgeons demonstrated that videos generated by our method were superior to those produced by conventional methods in terms of the ease of confirming the surgical area and the comfort during video viewing. Additionally, our approach showed improvements in video quality over existing techniques. Furthermore, we implemented several synthesis options for the proposed view-synthesis method and conducted a user study to assess surgeons' preferences for each option.

Motivation: 研究旨在解决花粉粒在显微镜图像中的自动化检测与分类问题，特别是在兽医细胞学等应用场景中。当前人工分析耗时费力，且不同成像模态（光学与全息显微镜）的性能差异较大，因此探索如何通过深度学习方法提升全息图像的检测与分类性能，将低成本无透镜数字全息显微镜与深度学习结合，具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: This study explores the application of deep learning to improve and automate pollen grain detection and classification in both optical and holographic microscopy images, with a particular focus on veterinary cytology use cases. We used YOLOv8s for object detection and MobileNetV3L for the classification task, evaluating their performance across imaging modalities. The models achieved 91.3% mAP50 for detection and 97% overall accuracy for classification on optical images, whereas the initial performance on greyscale holographic images was substantially lower. We addressed the performance gap issue through dataset expansion using automated labeling and bounding box area enlargement. These techniques, applied to holographic images, improved detection performance from 2.49% to 13.3% mAP50 and classification performance from 42% to 54%. Our work demonstrates that, at least for image classification tasks, it is possible to pair deep learning techniques with cost-effective lensless digital holographic microscopy devices.

Motivation: 研究发现CLIP模型中的模板样本相似性（TSS）会引入偏置，使模型过度依赖模板相似度而非真实的样本类别对齐，导致分类准确性和鲁棒性下降

Method: 提出一个两阶段框架：1）预训练阶段使用空提示捕获无偏模板特征，减少CLIP编码器中的模板诱导偏置；2）小样本微调阶段使用偏置校准损失强制图像与类别正确对齐，确保模型关注相关视觉线索

Result: 在多个基准测试上的实验表明，该模板校正方法显著减少了TSS引起的性能波动，获得了更高的分类准确性和更强的鲁棒性

Conclusion: 通过解耦CLIP中的模板偏置能有效提升小样本学习性能，空提示和偏置校准损失是解决该问题的有效方法

Abstract: The Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) model excels in few-shot learning by aligning visual and textual representations. Our study shows that template-sample similarity (TSS), defined as the resemblance between a text template and an image sample, introduces bias. This bias leads the model to rely on template proximity rather than true sample-to-category alignment, reducing both accuracy and robustness in classification. We present a framework that uses empty prompts, textual inputs that convey the idea of "emptiness" without category information. These prompts capture unbiased template features and offset TSS bias. The framework employs two stages. During pre-training, empty prompts reveal and reduce template-induced bias within the CLIP encoder. During few-shot fine-tuning, a bias calibration loss enforces correct alignment between images and their categories, ensuring the model focuses on relevant visual cues. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our template correction method significantly reduces performance fluctuations caused by TSS, yielding higher classification accuracy and stronger robustness.

Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) aims to enable unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to interpret natural language instructions and navigate complex urban environments using onboard visual observation. This task holds promise for real-world applications such as low-altitude inspection, search-and-rescue, and autonomous aerial delivery. Existing methods often rely on panoramic images, depth inputs, or odometry to support spatial reasoning and action planning. These requirements increase system cost and integration complexity, thus hindering practical deployment for lightweight UAVs. We present a unified aerial VLN framework that operates solely on egocentric monocular RGB observations and natural language instructions. The model formulates navigation as a next-token prediction problem, jointly optimizing spatial perception, trajectory reasoning, and action prediction through prompt-guided multi-task learning. Moreover, we propose a keyframe selection strategy to reduce visual redundancy by retaining semantically informative frames, along with an action merging and label reweighting mechanism that mitigates long-tailed supervision imbalance and facilitates stable multi-task co-training. Extensive experiments on the Aerial VLN benchmark validate the effectiveness of our method. Under the challenging monocular RGB-only setting, our model achieves strong results across both seen and unseen environments. It significantly outperforms existing RGB-only baselines and narrows the performance gap with state-of-the-art panoramic RGB-D counterparts. Comprehensive ablation studies further demonstrate the contribution of our task design and architectural choices.

Abstract: Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is a foundational component in robotics, AR/VR, and autonomous systems. With the rising focus on spatial AI in recent years, combining SLAM with semantic understanding has become increasingly important for enabling intelligent perception and interaction. Recent efforts have explored this integration, but they often rely on depth sensors or closed-set semantic models, limiting their scalability and adaptability in open-world environments. In this work, we present OpenMonoGS-SLAM, the first monocular SLAM framework that unifies 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with open-set semantic understanding. To achieve our goal, we leverage recent advances in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), including MASt3R for visual geometry and SAM and CLIP for open-vocabulary semantics. These models provide robust generalization across diverse tasks, enabling accurate monocular camera tracking and mapping, as well as a rich understanding of semantics in open-world environments. Our method operates without any depth input or 3D semantic ground truth, relying solely on self-supervised learning objectives. Furthermore, we propose a memory mechanism specifically designed to manage high-dimensional semantic features, which effectively constructs Gaussian semantic feature maps, leading to strong overall performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to or surpassing existing baselines in both closed-set and open-set segmentation tasks, all without relying on supplementary sensors such as depth maps or semantic annotations.

Abstract: Skin color has historically been a focal point of discrimination, yet fairness research in machine learning for medical imaging often relies on coarse subgroup categories, overlooking individual-level variations. Such group-based approaches risk obscuring biases faced by outliers within subgroups. This study introduces a distribution-based framework for evaluating and mitigating individual fairness in skin lesion classification. We treat skin tone as a continuous attribute rather than a categorical label, and employ kernel density estimation (KDE) to model its distribution. We further compare twelve statistical distance metrics to quantify disparities between skin tone distributions and propose a distance-based reweighting (DRW) loss function to correct underrepresentation in minority tones. Experiments across CNN and Transformer models demonstrate: (i) the limitations of categorical reweighting in capturing individual-level disparities, and (ii) the superior performance of distribution-based reweighting, particularly with Fidelity Similarity (FS), Wasserstein Distance (WD), Hellinger Metric (HM), and Harmonic Mean Similarity (HS). These findings establish a robust methodology for advancing fairness at individual level in dermatological AI systems, and highlight broader implications for sensitive continuous attributes in medical image analysis.

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用相机旋转引起的深度相关模糊特性，实现了有效的度量深度估计和轨迹重建，为手持拍摄场景下的深度感知提供了一种新思路和实用解决方案。

Abstract: In the absence of a mechanical stabilizer, the camera undergoes inevitable rotational dynamics during capturing, which induces perspective-based blur especially under long-exposure scenarios. From an optical standpoint, perspective-based blur is depth-position-dependent: objects residing at distinct spatial locations incur different blur levels even under the same imaging settings. Inspired by this, we propose a novel method that estimate metric depth by examining the blur pattern of a video stream and dense trajectory via joint optical design algorithm. Specifically, we employ off-the-shelf vision encoder and point tracker to extract video information. Then, we estimate depth map via windowed embedding and multi-window aggregation, and densify the sparse trajectory from the optical algorithm using a vision-language model. Evaluations on multiple depth datasets demonstrate that our method attains strong performance over large depth range, while maintaining favorable generalization. Relative to the real trajectory in handheld shooting settings, our optical algorithm achieves superior precision and the dense reconstruction maintains strong accuracy.

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image synthesis. However, addressing artifacts and unrealistic regions remains a critical challenge. We propose self-refining diffusion, a novel framework that enhances image generation quality by detecting these flaws. The framework employs an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based flaw highlighter to produce flaw activation maps (FAMs) that identify artifacts and unrealistic regions. These FAMs improve reconstruction quality by amplifying noise in flawed regions during the forward process and by focusing on these regions during the reverse process. The proposed approach achieves up to a 27.3% improvement in Fréchet inception distance across various diffusion-based models, demonstrating consistently strong performance on diverse datasets. It also shows robust effectiveness across different tasks, including image generation, text-to-image generation, and inpainting. These results demonstrate that explainable AI techniques can extend beyond interpretability to actively contribute to image refinement. The proposed framework offers a versatile and effective approach applicable to various diffusion models and tasks, significantly advancing the field of image synthesis.

Abstract: Document shadow removal is essential for enhancing the clarity of digitized documents. Preserving high-frequency details (e.g., text edges and lines) is critical in this process because shadows often obscure or distort fine structures. This paper proposes a matte vision transformer (MatteViT), a novel shadow removal framework that applies spatial and frequency-domain information to eliminate shadows while preserving fine-grained structural details. To effectively retain these details, we employ two preservation strategies. First, our method introduces a lightweight high-frequency amplification module (HFAM) that decomposes and adaptively amplifies high-frequency components. Second, we present a continuous luminance-based shadow matte, generated using a custom-built matte dataset and shadow matte generator, which provides precise spatial guidance from the earliest processing stage. These strategies enable the model to accurately identify fine-grained regions and restore them with high fidelity. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks (RDD and Kligler) demonstrate that MatteViT achieves state-of-the-art performance, providing a robust and practical solution for real-world document shadow removal. Furthermore, the proposed method better preserves text-level details in downstream tasks, such as optical character recognition, improving recognition performance over prior methods.

Abstract: While state-of-the-art image generation models achieve remarkable visual quality, their internal generative processes remain a "black box." This opacity limits human observation and intervention, and poses a barrier to ensuring model reliability, safety, and control. Furthermore, their non-human-like workflows make them difficult for human observers to interpret. To address this, we introduce the Chain-of-Image Generation (CoIG) framework, which reframes image generation as a sequential, semantic process analogous to how humans create art. Similar to the advantages in monitorability and performance that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) brought to large language models (LLMs), CoIG can produce equivalent benefits in text-to-image generation. CoIG utilizes an LLM to decompose a complex prompt into a sequence of simple, step-by-step instructions. The image generation model then executes this plan by progressively generating and editing the image. Each step focuses on a single semantic entity, enabling direct monitoring. We formally assess this property using two novel metrics: CoIG Readability, which evaluates the clarity of each intermediate step via its corresponding output; and Causal Relevance, which quantifies the impact of each procedural step on the final generated image. We further show that our framework mitigates entity collapse by decomposing the complex generation task into simple subproblems, analogous to the procedural reasoning employed by CoT. Our experimental results indicate that CoIG substantially enhances quantitative monitorability while achieving competitive compositional robustness compared to established baseline models. The framework is model-agnostic and can be integrated with any image generation model.

Conclusion: C-DIRA在紧凑性、效率和泛化能力方面表现出色，证实了其在边缘设备实时驾驶员分心行为识别中的有效性

Abstract: Driver distraction behavior recognition using in-vehicle cameras demands real-time inference on edge devices. However, lightweight models often fail to capture fine-grained behavioral cues, resulting in reduced performance on unseen drivers or under varying conditions. ROI-based methods also increase computational cost, making it difficult to balance efficiency and accuracy. This work addresses the need for a lightweight architecture that overcomes these constraints. We propose Computationally efficient Dynamic region of Interest Routing and domain-invariant Adversarial learning for lightweight driver behavior recognition (C-DIRA). The framework combines saliency-driven Top-K ROI pooling and fused classification for local feature extraction and integration. Dynamic ROI routing enables selective computation by applying ROI inference only to high difficulty data samples. Moreover, pseudo-domain labeling and adversarial learning are used to learn domain-invariant features robust to driver and background variation. Experiments on the State Farm Distracted Driver Detection Dataset show that C-DIRA maintains high accuracy with significantly fewer FLOPs and lower latency than prior lightweight models. It also demonstrates robustness under visual degradation such as blur and low-light, and stable performance across unseen domains. These results confirm C-DIRA's effectiveness in achieving compactness, efficiency, and generalization.

Abstract: Recent research in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly advanced our capabilities in cross-modal reasoning. However, existing methods suffer from performance degradation with domain changes or require substantial computational resources for fine-tuning in new domains. To address this issue, we develop a new adaptation method for large vision-language models, called \textit{Training-free Dual Hyperbolic Adapters} (T-DHA). We characterize the vision-language relationship between semantic concepts, which typically has a hierarchical tree structure, in the hyperbolic space instead of the traditional Euclidean space. Hyperbolic spaces exhibit exponential volume growth with radius, unlike the polynomial growth in Euclidean space. We find that this unique property is particularly effective for embedding hierarchical data structures using the Poincaré ball model, achieving significantly improved representation and discrimination power. Coupled with negative learning, it provides more accurate and robust classifications with fewer feature dimensions. Our extensive experimental results on various datasets demonstrate that the T-DHA method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in few-shot image recognition and domain generalization tasks.

Abstract: The dominance of denoising generative models (e.g., diffusion, flow-matching) in visual synthesis is tempered by their substantial training costs and inefficiencies in representation learning. While injecting discriminative representations via auxiliary alignment has proven effective, this approach still faces key limitations: the reliance on external, pre-trained encoders introduces overhead and domain shift. A dispersed-based strategy that encourages strong separation among in-batch latent representations alleviates this specific dependency. To assess the effect of the number of negative samples in generative modeling, we propose {\mname}, a plug-and-play training framework that requires no external encoders. Our method integrates a memory bank mechanism that maintains a large, dynamically updated queue of negative samples across training iterations. This decouples the number of negatives from the mini-batch size, providing abundant and high-quality negatives for a contrastive objective without a multiplicative increase in computational cost. A low-dimensional projection head is used to further minimize memory and bandwidth overhead. {\mname} offers three principal advantages: (1) it is self-contained, eliminating dependency on pretrained vision foundation models and their associated forward-pass overhead; (2) it introduces no additional parameters or computational cost during inference; and (3) it enables substantially faster convergence, achieving superior generative quality more efficiently. On ImageNet-256, {\mname} achieves a state-of-the-art FID of \textbf{2.40} within 400k steps, significantly outperforming comparable methods.

Abstract: Window attention and linear attention represent two principal strategies for mitigating the quadratic complexity and ever-growing KV cache in Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, we observe that window-based VLMs suffer performance degradation when sequence length exceeds the window size, while linear attention underperforms on information-intensive tasks such as OCR and document understanding. To overcome these limitations, we propose InfiniteVL, a linear-complexity VLM architecture that synergizes sliding window attention (SWA) with Gated DeltaNet. For achieving competitive multimodal performance under constrained resources, we design a three-stage training strategy comprising distillation pretraining, instruction tuning, and long-sequence SFT. Remarkably, using less than 2\% of the training data required by leading VLMs, InfiniteVL not only substantially outperforms previous linear-complexity VLMs but also matches the performance of leading Transformer-based VLMs, while demonstrating effective long-term memory retention. Compared to similar-sized Transformer-based VLMs accelerated by FlashAttention-2, InfiniteVL achieves over 3.6\times inference speedup while maintaining constant latency and memory footprint. In streaming video understanding scenarios, it sustains a stable 24 FPS real-time prefill speed while preserving long-term memory cache.

TL;DR: MoSAIC-ReID是一个基于Mixture-of-Experts的框架，通过量化行人属性在人员重识别中的重要性来增强模型的可解释性，揭示了哪些语义属性（如衣物颜色）对识别贡献最大


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的行人重识别方法虽然精度高但缺乏可解释性，不清楚模型具体依赖哪些高级语义属性进行识别，需要系统性地量化属性重要性

Method: 使用基于LoRA的专家模型，每个专家对应单一属性，配合预言机路由实现可控属性分析，结合广义线性模型、统计检验和特征重要性分析

Result: 在Market-1501和DukeMTMC数据集上实现了有竞争力的性能，更重要的是提供了大规模属性重要性量化研究，揭示了衣物颜色等内在特征贡献最大，而配饰等不常见线索影响有限

Conclusion: 提出了一个原则性的可解释ReID框架，强调了在实践中整合显式语义知识的必要性

Abstract: State-of-the-art person re-identification methods achieve impressive accuracy but remain largely opaque, leaving open the question: which high-level semantic attributes do these models actually rely on? We propose MoSAIC-ReID, a Mixture-of-Experts framework that systematically quantifies the importance of pedestrian attributes for re-identification. Our approach uses LoRA-based experts, each linked to a single attribute, and an oracle router that enables controlled attribution analysis. While MoSAIC-ReID achieves competitive performance on Market-1501 and DukeMTMC under the assumption that attribute annotations are available at test time, its primary value lies in providing a large-scale, quantitative study of attribute importance across intrinsic and extrinsic cues. Using generalized linear models, statistical tests, and feature-importance analyses, we reveal which attributes, such as clothing colors and intrinsic characteristics, contribute most strongly, while infrequent cues (e.g. accessories) have limited effect. This work offers a principled framework for interpretable ReID and highlights the requirements for integrating explicit semantic knowledge in practice.

Result: 在多个遥感数据集上的实验表明，这种简单适配取得了有希望的性能，展示了SAM 3在遥感开放词汇语义分割中的潜力。

Conclusion: SAM 3模型在遥感开放词汇语义分割任务中表现出良好前景，通过简单的掩码融合和存在分数过滤就能达到不错效果，证明了其在遥感场景中的应用价值。

Abstract: Most existing methods for training-free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) are based on CLIP. While these approaches have made progress, they often face challenges in precise localization or require complex pipelines to combine separate modules, especially in remote sensing scenarios where numerous dense and small targets are present. Recently, Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM 3) was proposed, unifying segmentation and recognition in a promptable framework. In this paper, we present a preliminary exploration of applying SAM 3 to the remote sensing OVSS task without any training. First, we implement a mask fusion strategy that combines the outputs from SAM 3's semantic segmentation head and the Transformer decoder (instance head). This allows us to leverage the strengths of both heads for better land coverage. Second, we utilize the presence score from the presence head to filter out categories that do not exist in the scene, reducing false positives caused by the vast vocabulary sizes and patch-level processing in geospatial scenes. We evaluate our method on extensive remote sensing datasets. Experiments show that this simple adaptation achieves promising performance, demonstrating the potential of SAM 3 for remote sensing OVSS.

Motivation: 手语识别领域目前缺乏对手语查询检索任务的研究，即在连续手语序列中检测特定手语是否存在。作者将这一新任务定义为"Sign Language Spotting"，旨在为聋哑人和听力社区搭建沟通桥梁。

Method: 使用从手语视频中提取的姿态关键点作为输入，采用编码器-分类器架构实现端到端检测。相比传统基于中间词汇识别或文本匹配的方法，该方法直接处理姿态表征，避免依赖RGB原始帧，降低计算成本并减少视觉噪声。

Conclusion: 基于姿态的方法为手语点检测任务建立了有效框架，为未来自动手语检索和验证研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Automatic Sign Language Recognition (ASLR) has emerged as a vital field for bridging the gap between deaf and hearing communities. However, the problem of sign-to-sign retrieval or detecting a specific sign within a sequence of continuous signs remains largely unexplored. We define this novel task as Sign Language Spotting. In this paper, we present a first step toward sign language retrieval by addressing the challenge of detecting the presence or absence of a query sign video within a sentence-level gloss or sign video. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on intermediate gloss recognition or text-based matching, we propose an end-to-end model that directly operates on pose keypoints extracted from sign videos. Our architecture employs an encoder-only backbone with a binary classification head to determine whether the query sign appears within the target sequence. By focusing on pose representations instead of raw RGB frames, our method significantly reduces computational cost and mitigates visual noise. We evaluate our approach on the Word Presence Prediction dataset from the WSLP 2025 shared task, achieving 61.88\% accuracy and 60.00\% F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our pose-based framework for Sign Language Spotting, establishing a strong foundation for future research in automatic sign language retrieval and verification.

Abstract: Visual reasoning is challenging, requiring both precise object grounding and understanding complex spatial relationships. Existing methods fall into two camps: language-only chain-of-thought approaches, which demand large-scale (image, query, answer) supervision, and program-synthesis approaches which use pre-trained models and avoid training, but suffer from flawed logic and erroneous grounding. We propose an annotation-free training framework that improves both reasoning and grounding. Our framework uses AI-powered verifiers: an LLM verifier refines LLM reasoning via reinforcement learning, while a VLM verifier strengthens visual grounding through automated hard-negative mining, eliminating the need for ground truth labels. This design combines the strengths of modern AI systems: advanced language-only reasoning models for decomposing spatial queries into simpler subtasks, and strong vision specialist models improved via performant VLM critics. We evaluate our approach across diverse spatial reasoning tasks, and show that our method improves visual reasoning and surpasses open-source and proprietary models, while with our improved visual grounding model we further outperform recent text-only visual reasoning methods.

Abstract: Industrial mushroom cultivation increasingly relies on computer vision for monitoring and automated harvesting. However, developing accurate detection and segmentation models requires large, precisely annotated datasets that are costly to produce. Synthetic data provides a scalable alternative, yet often lacks sufficient realism to generalize to real-world scenarios. This paper presents a novel workflow that integrates 3D rendering in Blender with a constrained diffusion model to automatically generate high-quality annotated, photorealistic synthetic images of Agaricus Bisporus mushrooms. This approach preserves full control over 3D scene configuration and annotations while achieving photorealism without the need for specialized computer graphics expertise. We release two synthetic datasets (each containing 6,000 images depicting over 250k mushroom instances) and evaluate Mask R-CNN models trained on them in a zero-shot setting. When tested on two independent real-world datasets (including a newly collected benchmark), our method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance (F1 = 0.859 on M18K), despite using only synthetic training data. Although the approach is demonstrated on Agaricus Bisporus mushrooms, the proposed pipeline can be readily adapted to other mushroom species or to other agricultural domains, such as fruit and leaf detection.

Motivation: 现有的高性能计算机视觉模型在医学影像中表现优异，但模型计算量大、尺寸大，难以部署在边缘设备上，同时严格的隐私约束阻碍了中心化数据管理，因此需要联邦学习方案。

Method: 提出了一种基于输出分布统计偏度指导的剪枝方法，选择性剪裁多模态Swin Transformer的多头自注意力和多层感知器层。采用了横向联邦学习环境进行验证。

Result: 在紧凑Swin Transformer上的实验显示，模型尺寸减少了约36%，同时保持了准确的性能不降低。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了在边缘设备上实现高效模型压缩和隐私保护的分布式学习的可行性。

Abstract: In recent years, high-performance computer vision models have achieved remarkable success in medical imaging, with some skin lesion classification systems even surpassing dermatology specialists in diagnostic accuracy. However, such models are computationally intensive and large in size, making them unsuitable for deployment on edge devices. In addition, strict privacy constraints hinder centralized data management, motivating the adoption of Federated Learning (FL). To address these challenges, this study proposes a skewness-guided pruning method that selectively prunes the Multi-Head Self-Attention and Multi-Layer Perceptron layers of a multimodal Swin Transformer based on the statistical skewness of their output distributions. The proposed method was validated in a horizontal FL environment and shown to maintain performance while substantially reducing model complexity. Experiments on the compact Swin Transformer demonstrate approximately 36\% model size reduction with no loss in accuracy. These findings highlight the feasibility of achieving efficient model compression and privacy-preserving distributed learning for multimodal medical AI on edge devices.

Motivation: 当前扩散Transformer虽能生成高质量视频，但能根据过去观察和动作预测长时序未来的通用世界模型仍不足，尤其在通用场景和多样化动作形式方面存在空白。

Method: 提出自回归去噪架构，使用时序因果注意力聚合过去观察；采用噪声增强历史记忆避免对过去帧的过度依赖；开发动作感知适配器直接注入动作信号；构建动作专家混合动态路由异构动作模态。

Conclusion: Astra通过创新的架构设计实现了交互式、一致且通用的长时序视频预测，支持多种交互形式，为现实世界任务提供了强大工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion transformers have empowered video generation models to generate high-quality video clips from texts or images. However, world models with the ability to predict long-horizon futures from past observations and actions remain underexplored, especially for general-purpose scenarios and various forms of actions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Astra, an interactive general world model that generates real-world futures for diverse scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving, robot grasping) with precise action interactions (e.g., camera motion, robot action). We propose an autoregressive denoising architecture and use temporal causal attention to aggregate past observations and support streaming outputs. We use a noise-augmented history memory to avoid over-reliance on past frames to balance responsiveness with temporal coherence. For precise action control, we introduce an action-aware adapter that directly injects action signals into the denoising process. We further develop a mixture of action experts that dynamically route heterogeneous action modalities, enhancing versatility across diverse real-world tasks such as exploration, manipulation, and camera control. Astra achieves interactive, consistent, and general long-term video prediction and supports various forms of interactions. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate the improvements of Astra in fidelity, long-range prediction, and action alignment over existing state-of-the-art world models.

TL;DR: Wan-Move是一个简单且可扩展的框架，它通过使原始条件特征具备运动感知能力来实现视频生成模型的精确运动控制，无需修改模型架构，并在用户研究中展现了与商业产品Kling 1.5 Pro运动笔刷相媲美的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的运动控制方法通常存在控制粒度粗糙和可扩展性有限的问题，导致生成的视频在实际应用中效果不足。

Method: 1. 使用密集点轨迹表示物体运动，实现精细的场景控制；2. 将轨迹投影到潜在空间，并沿每条轨迹传播第一帧的特征，生成对齐的时空特征图；3. 将该特征图作为更新的潜在条件，无缝集成到现成的图像到视频模型（如Wan-I2V-14B）中作为运动指导。

Result: 通过规模化训练，Wan-Move能够生成5秒480p视频，其运动可控性在用户研究中与Kling 1.5 Pro的商业运动笔刷相当。作者还构建了MoveBench基准测试，包含更大数据量、更长视频时长和高质量运动标注。

Conclusion: Wan-Move框架能够实现精确、高质量的运动控制，无需额外运动编码器，具有良好的可扩展性，在多个数据集上的实验均展示了其优越的运动质量。

Abstract: We present Wan-Move, a simple and scalable framework that brings motion control to video generative models. Existing motion-controllable methods typically suffer from coarse control granularity and limited scalability, leaving their outputs insufficient for practical use. We narrow this gap by achieving precise and high-quality motion control. Our core idea is to directly make the original condition features motion-aware for guiding video synthesis. To this end, we first represent object motions with dense point trajectories, allowing fine-grained control over the scene. We then project these trajectories into latent space and propagate the first frame's features along each trajectory, producing an aligned spatiotemporal feature map that tells how each scene element should move. This feature map serves as the updated latent condition, which is naturally integrated into the off-the-shelf image-to-video model, e.g., Wan-I2V-14B, as motion guidance without any architecture change. It removes the need for auxiliary motion encoders and makes fine-tuning base models easily scalable. Through scaled training, Wan-Move generates 5-second, 480p videos whose motion controllability rivals Kling 1.5 Pro's commercial Motion Brush, as indicated by user studies. To support comprehensive evaluation, we further design MoveBench, a rigorously curated benchmark featuring diverse content categories and hybrid-verified annotations. It is distinguished by larger data volume, longer video durations, and high-quality motion annotations. Extensive experiments on MoveBench and the public dataset consistently show Wan-Move's superior motion quality. Code, models, and benchmark data are made publicly available.

Abstract: Personalizing visual generative models to meet specific user needs has gained increasing attention, yet current methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) remain impractical due to their demand for task-specific data and lengthy optimization. While a few hypernetwork-based approaches attempt to predict adaptation weights directly, they struggle to map fine-grained user prompts to complex LoRA distributions, limiting their practical applicability. To bridge this gap, we propose LoFA, a general framework that efficiently predicts personalized priors for fast model adaptation. We first identify a key property of LoRA: structured distribution patterns emerge in the relative changes between LoRA and base model parameters. Building on this, we design a two-stage hypernetwork: first predicting relative distribution patterns that capture key adaptation regions, then using these to guide final LoRA weight prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently predicts high-quality personalized priors within seconds, across multiple tasks and user prompts, even outperforming conventional LoRA that requires hours of processing.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: It has been hypothesized that human-level visual perception requires a generative approach in which internal representations result from inverting a decoder. Yet today's most successful vision models are non-generative, relying on an encoder that maps images to representations without decoder inversion. This raises the question of whether generation is, in fact, necessary for machines to achieve human-level visual perception. To address this, we study whether generative and non-generative methods can achieve compositional generalization, a hallmark of human perception. Under a compositional data generating process, we formalize the inductive biases required to guarantee compositional generalization in decoder-based (generative) and encoder-based (non-generative) methods. We then show theoretically that enforcing these inductive biases on encoders is generally infeasible using regularization or architectural constraints. In contrast, for generative methods, the inductive biases can be enforced straightforwardly, thereby enabling compositional generalization by constraining a decoder and inverting it. We highlight how this inversion can be performed efficiently, either online through gradient-based search or offline through generative replay. We examine the empirical implications of our theory by training a range of generative and non-generative methods on photorealistic image datasets. We find that, without the necessary inductive biases, non-generative methods often fail to generalize compositionally and require large-scale pretraining or added supervision to improve generalization. By comparison, generative methods yield significant improvements in compositional generalization, without requiring additional data, by leveraging suitable inductive biases on a decoder along with search and replay.

Abstract: Verifiable geometric reasoning is a critical component for trustworthy and controllable agentic AI. Despite impressive capabilities, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often fail under realistic scene changes. We present Tri-Bench, a compact benchmark of planar triangle problems that isolates relative geometric reasoning while stressing two deployment-critical factors: camera pose (planar vs. tilted) and scene context via object interference (10 everyday objects). To test verifiability and control, we evaluate four recent VLMs using a single, fixed prompt whose guardrail explicitly describes a surrounding square border, enabling correct answers via homography. We evaluate six simple tasks over binary and continuous targets, and observe that the overall accuracy with respect to 3D ground truth is modest, ~69% on average (best ~75%, worst ~64%). The same responses align even more closely with 2D projections in the image plane, where mean accuracy is ~72%. All four VLMs consistently fail, with accuracy falling to ~0%, on recognizing minority shape classes (equilateral, isosceles, right-angled triangles). Additionally, overall VLM accuracy degrades by ~4.1% under camera tilt. This demonstrates that models fail to correctly utilize the explicit frame-of-reference hint provided in the prompt and default to 2D image plane cues. Finally, we find that object interference has no significant effect on VLM accuracy.

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) are emerging as powerful generalist tools for remote sensing, capable of integrating information across diverse tasks and enabling flexible, instruction-based interactions via a chat interface. In this work, we enhance VLM-based visual grounding in satellite imagery by proposing a novel structured localization mechanism. Our approach involves finetuning a pretrained VLM on a diverse set of instruction-following tasks, while interfacing a dedicated grounding module through specialized control tokens for localization. This method facilitates joint reasoning over both language and spatial information, significantly enhancing the model's ability to precisely localize objects in complex satellite scenes. We evaluate our framework on several remote sensing benchmarks, consistently improving the state-of-the-art, including a 24.8% relative improvement over previous methods on visual grounding. Our results highlight the benefits of integrating structured spatial reasoning into VLMs, paving the way for more reliable real-world satellite data analysis.

Abstract: Rotation invariance is essential for precise, object-level segmentation in UAV aerial imagery, where targets can have arbitrary orientations and exhibit fine-scale details. Conventional segmentation architectures like U-Net rely on convolution operators that are not rotation-invariant, leading to degraded segmentation accuracy across varying viewpoints. Rotation invariance can be achieved by expanding the filter bank across multiple orientations; however, this will significantly increase computational cost and memory traffic. In this paper, we introduce a GPU-optimized rotation-invariant convolution framework that eliminates the traditional data-lowering (im2col) step required for matrix-multiplication-based convolution. By exploiting structured data sharing among symmetrically rotated filters, our method achieves multi-orientation convolution with greatly reduced memory traffic and computational redundancy. We further generalize the approach to accelerate convolution with arbitrary (non-symmetric) rotation angles.
  Across extensive benchmarks, the proposed convolution achieves 20--55% faster training and 15--45% lower energy consumption than CUDNN, while maintaining accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art rotation-invariant methods. In the eight-orientation setting, our approach achieves up to 45% speedup and 41% energy savings on 256\(\times\)256 inputs, and 32% speedup and 23% lower energy usage on 1024\(\times\)1024 inputs. Integrated into a U-Net segmentation model, the framework yields up to 6% improvement in accuracy over the non-rotation-aware baseline. These results demonstrate that the proposed method provides an effective and highly efficient alternative to existing rotation-invariant CNN frameworks.

Conclusion: UniLayDiff成功实现了内容感知布局生成任务的统一处理，提供了高质量的布局生成解决方案

Abstract: Content-aware layout generation is a critical task in graphic design automation, focused on creating visually appealing arrangements of elements that seamlessly blend with a given background image. The variety of real-world applications makes it highly challenging to develop a single model capable of unifying the diverse range of input-constrained generation sub-tasks, such as those conditioned by element types, sizes, or their relationships. Current methods either address only a subset of these tasks or necessitate separate model parameters for different conditions, failing to offer a truly unified solution. In this paper, we propose UniLayDiff: a Unified Diffusion Transformer, that for the first time, addresses various content-aware layout generation tasks with a single, end-to-end trainable model. Specifically, we treat layout constraints as a distinct modality and employ Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer framework to capture the complex interplay between the background image, layout elements, and diverse constraints. Moreover, we integrate relation constraints through fine-tuning the model with LoRA after pretraining the model on other tasks. Such a schema not only achieves unified conditional generation but also enhances overall layout quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniLayDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance across from unconditional to various conditional generation tasks and, to the best of our knowledge, is the first model to unify the full range of content-aware layout generation tasks.

Abstract: Generating high-quality, textured 3D scenes from a single image remains a fundamental challenge in vision and graphics. Recent image-to-3D generators recover reasonable geometry from single views, but their object-centric training limits generalization to complex, large-scale scenes with faithful structure and texture. We present EvoScene, a self-evolving, training-free framework that progressively reconstructs complete 3D scenes from single images. The key idea is combining the complementary strengths of existing models: geometric reasoning from 3D generation models and visual knowledge from video generation models. Through three iterative stages--Spatial Prior Initialization, Visual-guided 3D Scene Mesh Generation, and Spatial-guided Novel View Generation--EvoScene alternates between 2D and 3D domains, gradually improving both structure and appearance. Experiments on diverse scenes demonstrate that EvoScene achieves superior geometric stability, view-consistent textures, and unseen-region completion compared to strong baselines, producing ready-to-use 3D meshes for practical applications.

Conclusion: LiDAS将现有前照灯转变为主动视觉执行器，为提升夜间感知鲁棒性提供了一种经济有效的解决方案

Abstract: Nighttime environments pose significant challenges for camera-based perception, as existing methods passively rely on the scene lighting. We introduce Lighting-driven Dynamic Active Sensing (LiDAS), a closed-loop active illumination system that combines off-the-shelf visual perception models with high-definition headlights. Rather than uniformly brightening the scene, LiDAS dynamically predicts an optimal illumination field that maximizes downstream perception performance, i.e., decreasing light on empty areas to reallocate it on object regions. LiDAS enables zero-shot nighttime generalization of daytime-trained models through adaptive illumination control. Trained on synthetic data and deployed zero-shot in real-world closed-loop driving scenarios, LiDAS enables +18.7% mAP50 and +5.0% mIoU over standard low-beam at equal power. It maintains performances while reducing energy use by 40%. LiDAS complements domain-generalization methods, further strengthening robustness without retraining. By turning readily available headlights into active vision actuators, LiDAS offers a cost-effective solution to robust nighttime perception.

Conclusion: D4RT提供了一种轻量、高度可扩展的方法，能够高效解决动态场景的4D重建问题，为复杂几何和运动理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding and reconstructing the complex geometry and motion of dynamic scenes from video remains a formidable challenge in computer vision. This paper introduces D4RT, a simple yet powerful feedforward model designed to efficiently solve this task. D4RT utilizes a unified transformer architecture to jointly infer depth, spatio-temporal correspondence, and full camera parameters from a single video. Its core innovation is a novel querying mechanism that sidesteps the heavy computation of dense, per-frame decoding and the complexity of managing multiple, task-specific decoders. Our decoding interface allows the model to independently and flexibly probe the 3D position of any point in space and time. The result is a lightweight and highly scalable method that enables remarkably efficient training and inference. We demonstrate that our approach sets a new state of the art, outperforming previous methods across a wide spectrum of 4D reconstruction tasks.

TL;DR: ThreadWeaver框架通过并行推理在保持高准确率的同时显著降低大语言模型的推理延迟，在六个数学推理基准测试中实现与顶尖顺序推理模型相当的性能，平均加速1.53倍。

Motivation: 传统顺序解码推理延迟高，现有并行推理方法要么局限于监督行为克隆，要么相比顺序链式思维基线准确率显著下降，且需要定制推理引擎，部署复杂。

Method: 1) 两阶段并行轨迹生成器产生带并行标注的高质量链式思维数据用于监督微调；2) 基于trie的训练推理协同设计，可在标准自回归推理引擎上实现并行推理而无需修改位置编码或KV缓存；3) 并行化感知强化学习框架，教导模型在准确率与有效并行化间取得平衡。

Conclusion: ThreadWeaver框架通过创新的并行推理方法，实现了在保持与顶级顺序推理模型相当准确率的同时显著提升推理效率，无需定制推理引擎即可部署。

Abstract: Scaling inference-time computation has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve strong reasoning performance, but inherently sequential decoding leads to substantial latency, especially on complex tasks. Recent work on adaptive parallel reasoning aims to improve inference efficiency by decomposing the problem-solving process into concurrent reasoning threads when beneficial. However, existing methods on realistic tasks are either limited to supervised behavior cloning or exhibit significant accuracy drops compared to widely-used sequential long chain-of-thought (CoT) baselines. Moreover, many require customized inference engines, complicating deployment. We introduce ThreadWeaver, a framework for adaptive parallel reasoning that achieves accuracy on par with popular sequential reasoning models of comparable size while significantly reducing inference latency. ThreadWeaver's performance stems from three key innovations: 1) a two-stage parallel trajectory generator that produces large-scale, high-quality CoT data with parallel annotations for supervised fine-tuning; 2) a trie-based training-inference co-design that enables parallel reasoning on any off-the-shelf autoregressive inference engine without modifying position embeddings or KV caches; and 3) a parallelization-aware reinforcement learning framework that teaches the model to balance accuracy with effective parallelization. Across six challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ThreadWeaver trained atop Qwen3-8B achieves accuracy comparable to cutting-edge sequential reasoning models (71.9% on average and 79.9% on AIME24) while delivering up to 1.53x average speedup in token latency, establishing a new Pareto frontier between accuracy and efficiency.

TL;DR: 本文提出在长尾分布中解决特征和分类器权重空间错配问题的方法，通过三种即插即用的对齐策略显著提升现有方法的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管神经坍缩研究揭示了在类别平衡条件下特征均值和分类器权重会自发对齐形成单纯形等角紧框架，但在长尾分布中，样本严重失衡阻碍了神经坍缩现象的出现，导致泛化性能下降。现有方法主要尝试通过约束特征或分类器权重来恢复ETF几何结构，但忽略了特征空间与分类器权重空间之间的严重错配问题

Method: 首先通过最优错误指数分析量化了这种错配的危害。基于这一洞察，提出了三种即插即用的显式对齐策略：权重对齐模块、特征对齐模块和双向对齐模块。这些策略无需改变现有长尾方法的架构即可融入其中

Result: 在CIFAR-10-LT、CIFAR-100-LT和ImageNet-LT数据集上进行的大量实验表明，提出的策略能够持续提升基准方法的性能，达到了最先进的水平

Conclusion: 本文首次从理论和实验上揭示了长尾分布中特征与分类器权重空间错配问题的危害，并提出了一种有效且易于整合的显式对齐框架，为改善长尾学习性能提供了新思路

Abstract: Recent studies on Neural Collapse (NC) reveal that, under class-balanced conditions, the class feature means and classifier weights spontaneously align into a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF). In long-tailed regimes, however, severe sample imbalance tends to prevent the emergence of the NC phenomenon, resulting in poor generalization performance. Current efforts predominantly seek to recover the ETF geometry by imposing constraints on features or classifier weights, yet overlook a critical problem: There is a pronounced misalignment between the feature and the classifier weight spaces. In this paper, we theoretically quantify the harm of such misalignment through an optimal error exponent analysis. Built on this insight, we propose three explicit alignment strategies that plug-and-play into existing long-tail methods without architectural change. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-10-LT, CIFAR-100-LT, and ImageNet-LT datasets consistently boost examined baselines and achieve the state-of-the-art performances.

Motivation: 纽约市每年发生超过十万起机动车碰撞事故，造成巨大的伤亡和公共卫生负担，需要开发高效且可解释的预测模型来支持城市规模的伤害分析。

Method: 整合三个相关表（包含数千万条记录），构建统一特征模式并存储在分区存储中，训练基于树的集成模型（随机森林和XGBoost），并将其与使用文本摘要提示的小型语言模型进行比较。

Result: 在时间隔离的测试集上，XGBoost和随机森林分别达到0.7828和0.7794的准确率，明显优于小型语言模型（0.594和0.496）。类不平衡分析显示简单类别加权可提高致命事故的召回率，SHAP归因分析突出了人员脆弱性因素、时间、地点是预测严重程度的主要驱动因素。

Abstract: New York City reports over one hundred thousand motor vehicle collisions each year, creating substantial injury and public health burden. We present RaX-Crash, a resource efficient and explainable small model pipeline for structured injury severity prediction on the official NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions dataset. RaX-Crash integrates three linked tables with tens of millions of records, builds a unified feature schema in partitioned storage, and trains compact tree based ensembles (Random Forest and XGBoost) on engineered tabular features, which are compared against locally deployed small language models (SLMs) prompted with textual summaries. On a temporally held out test set, XGBoost and Random Forest achieve accuracies of 0.7828 and 0.7794, clearly outperforming SLMs (0.594 and 0.496); class imbalance analysis shows that simple class weighting improves fatal recall with modest accuracy trade offs, and SHAP attribution highlights human vulnerability factors, timing, and location as dominant drivers of predicted severity. Overall, RaX-Crash indicates that interpretable small model ensembles remain strong baselines for city scale injury analytics, while hybrid pipelines that pair tabular predictors with SLM generated narratives improve communication without sacrificing scalability.

Abstract: Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy (SUDEP) and acute ischemic stroke are life-threatening conditions involving complex interactions across cortical, brainstem, and autonomic systems. We present a unified geometric-stochastic multimodal deep learning framework that integrates EEG, ECG, respiration, SpO2, EMG, and fMRI signals to model SUDEP and stroke vulnerability. The approach combines Riemannian manifold embeddings, Lie-group invariant feature representations, fractional stochastic dynamics, Hamiltonian energy-flow modeling, and cross-modal attention mechanisms. Stroke propagation is modeled using fractional epidemic diffusion over structural brain graphs. Experiments on the MULTI-CLARID dataset demonstrate improved predictive accuracy and interpretable biomarkers derived from manifold curvature, fractional memory indices, attention entropy, and diffusion centrality. The proposed framework provides a mathematically principled foundation for early detection, risk stratification, and interpretable multimodal modeling in neural-autonomic disorders.

Conclusion: 该框架能有效预测多模态模型在训练期间的峰值 GPU 内存使用，为解决内存溢出问题提供了实用工具，显著提高了资源利用率。

Abstract: As deep learning models in agentic AI systems grow in scale and complexity, GPU memory requirements increase and often exceed the available GPU memory capacity, so that out-of-memory (OoM) errors occur. It is well known that OoM interrupts the whole training itself and wastes substantial computational resources. Therefore, to prevent OoM, accurate prediction of GPU memory usage is essential. However, previous studies focus only on unimodal architectures and fail to generalize to multimodal models, even though the multimodal models are a common choice in agentic AI systems. To address this limitation, we propose a framework that predicts the peak GPU memory usage by analyzing the model architecture and training behavior of multimodal models. Specifically, the framework decomposes the multimodal model into its constituent layers and applies factorization to estimate the memory usage of each layer. Our evaluation shows that our framework achieves high prediction accuracy of ~8.7% average MAPE.

Abstract: Traffic forecasting task is significant to modern urban management. Recently, there is growing attention on large-scale forecasting, as it better reflects the complexity of real-world traffic networks. However, existing models often exhibit quadratic computational complexity, making them impractical for large-scale real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Mixer (HSTMixer), which leverages an all-MLP architecture for efficient and effective large-scale traffic forecasting. HSTMixer employs a hierarchical spatiotemporal mixing block to extract multi-resolution features through bottom-up aggregation and top-down propagation. Furthermore, an adaptive region mixer generates transformation matrices based on regional semantics, enabling our model to dynamically capture evolving spatiotemporal patterns for different regions. Extensive experiments conducted on four large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but also exhibits competitive computational efficiency.

Conclusion: LAPA通过算法-架构协同设计有效解决了跨阶段Transformer稀疏加速问题，显著提升了能效，为动态序列长的Transformer计算提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Attention-based Transformers have revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) and shown strong performance in computer vision (CV) tasks. However, as the input sequence varies, the computational bottlenecks in Transformer models exhibit dynamic behavior across stages, which calls for a cross-stage sparse acceleration strategy. Unfortunately, most existing sparse Transformer approaches are single-stage based, and their sparsity prediction mechanisms lead to significant power overhead when applied across multiple stages. To this end, this paper proposes a log-domain attention prediction algorithm-architecture co-design, named LAPA. First, an asymmetric leading one computing (ALOC) scheme is designed to eliminate expensive multiplications. Next, a mixed-precision multi-round shifting accumulation (MRSA) mechanism is further proposed to mitigate the accumulation overhead. A data-feature dependent filter (DDF) strategy is designed to work in concert with the MRSA process. Finally, an elaborate accelerator is designed to translate the theoretical enhancement into practical hardware improvement. Experimental results show that LAPA achieves 3.52x, 3.24x and 2.79x higher energy efficiency than the state-of-the-art (SOTA) works Spatten, Sanger and FACT, respectively.

Abstract: Accurate disease detection is of paramount importance for effective medical treatment and patient care. However, the process of disease detection is often associated with extensive medical testing and considerable costs, making it impractical to perform all possible medical tests on a patient to diagnose or predict hundreds or thousands of diseases. In this work, we propose Collaborative Learning for Disease Detection (CLDD), a novel graph-based deep learning model that formulates disease detection as a collaborative learning task by exploiting associations among diseases and similarities among patients adaptively. CLDD integrates patient-disease interactions and demographic features from electronic health records to detect hundreds or thousands of diseases for every patient, with little to no reliance on the corresponding medical tests. Extensive experiments on a processed version of the MIMIC-IV dataset comprising 61,191 patients and 2,000 diseases demonstrate that CLDD consistently outperforms representative baselines across multiple metrics, achieving a 6.33\% improvement in recall and 7.63\% improvement in precision. Furthermore, case studies on individual patients illustrate that CLDD can successfully recover masked diseases within its top-ranked predictions, demonstrating both interpretability and reliability in disease prediction. By reducing diagnostic costs and improving accessibility, CLDD holds promise for large-scale disease screening and social health security.

Abstract: We present Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) which have made significant progress in various tasks, but their robustness against domain noise, structural perturbations, and adversarial attacks remains underexplored. A key limitation is the insufficient modeling of hierarchical structural semantics, which are crucial for generalization. In this paper, we propose SA^2GFM, a robust GFM framework that improves domain-adaptive representations through Structure-Aware Semantic Augmentation. First, we encode hierarchical structural priors by transforming entropy-based encoding trees into structure-aware textual prompts for feature augmentation. The enhanced inputs are processed by a self-supervised Information Bottleneck mechanism that distills robust, transferable representations via structure-guided compression. To address negative transfer in cross-domain adaptation, we introduce an expert adaptive routing mechanism, combining a mixture-of-experts architecture with a null expert design. For efficient downstream adaptation, we propose a fine-tuning module that optimizes hierarchical structures through joint intra- and inter-community structure learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SA^2GFM outperforms 9 state-of-the-art baselines in terms of effectiveness and robustness against random noise and adversarial perturbations for node and graph classification.

Conclusion: FAIM作为一种轻量级频率感知模型，通过频域特征提取和多粒度信息交互，有效解决了时间序列分类中的关键挑战，在准确性和效率方面均表现出色。

Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) is crucial in numerous real-world applications, such as environmental monitoring, medical diagnosis, and posture recognition. TSC tasks require models to effectively capture discriminative information for accurate class identification. Although deep learning architectures excel at capturing temporal dependencies, they often suffer from high computational cost, sensitivity to noise perturbations, and susceptibility to overfitting on small-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose FAIM, a lightweight Frequency-Aware Interactive Mamba model. Specifically, we introduce an Adaptive Filtering Block (AFB) that leverages Fourier Transform to extract frequency-domain features from time series data. The AFB incorporates learnable adaptive thresholds to dynamically suppress noise and employs element-wise coupling of global and local semantic adaptive filtering, enabling in-depth modeling of the synergy among different frequency components. Furthermore, we design an Interactive Mamba Block (IMB) to facilitate efficient multi-granularity information interaction, balancing the extraction of fine-grained discriminative features and comprehensive global contextual information, thereby endowing FAIM with powerful and expressive representations for TSC tasks. Additionally, we incorporate a self-supervised pre-training mechanism to enhance FAIM's understanding of complex temporal patterns and improve its robustness across various domains and high-noise scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that FAIM consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving a superior trade-off between accuracy and efficiency and exhibits outstanding performance.

Abstract: Semi-supervised anomaly detection (AD) has shown great promise by effectively leveraging limited labeled data. However, existing methods are typically structured around scoring individual points or simple pairs. Such {point- or pair-centric} view not only overlooks the contextual nature of anomalies, which are defined by their deviation from a collective group, but also fails to exploit the rich supervisory signals that can be generated from the combinatorial composition of sets. Consequently, such models struggle to exploit the high-order interactions within the data, which are critical for learning discriminative representations. To address these limitations, we propose SetAD, a novel framework that reframes semi-supervised AD as a Set-level Anomaly Detection task. SetAD employs an attention-based set encoder trained via a graded learning objective, where the model learns to quantify the degree of anomalousness within an entire set. This approach directly models the complex group-level interactions that define anomalies. Furthermore, to enhance robustness and score calibration, we propose a context-calibrated anomaly scoring mechanism, which assesses a point's anomaly score by aggregating its normalized deviations from peer behavior across multiple, diverse contextual sets. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that SetAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models. Notably, we show that our model's performance consistently improves with increasing set size, providing strong empirical support for the set-based formulation of anomaly detection.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个可重复的无人监督学习流程，能将原始贸易数据转化为优先级的可用情报，支持监管机构有效执行环境条约

Abstract: New methods are needed to monitor environmental treaties, like the Montreal Protocol, by reviewing large, complex customs datasets. This paper introduces a framework using unsupervised machine learning to systematically detect suspicious trade patterns and highlight activities for review. Our methodology, applied to 100,000 trade records, combines several ML techniques. Unsupervised Clustering (K-Means) discovers natural trade archetypes based on shipment value and weight. Anomaly Detection (Isolation Forest and IQR) identifies rare "mega-trades" and shipments with commercially unusual price-per-kilogram values. This is supplemented by Heuristic Flagging to find tactics like vague shipment descriptions. These layers are combined into a priority score, which successfully identified 1,351 price outliers and 1,288 high-priority shipments for customs review. A key finding is that high-priority commodities show a different and more valuable value-to-weight ratio than general goods. This was validated using Explainable AI (SHAP), which confirmed vague descriptions and high value as the most significant risk predictors. The model's sensitivity was validated by its detection of a massive spike in "mega-trades" in early 2021, correlating directly with the real-world regulatory impact of the US AIM Act. This work presents a repeatable unsupervised learning pipeline to turn raw trade data into prioritized, usable intelligence for regulatory groups.

Abstract: We transform large-scale Swedish register data into textual life trajectories to address two long-standing challenges in data analysis: high cardinality of categorical variables and inconsistencies in coding schemes over time. Leveraging this uniquely comprehensive population register, we convert register data from 6.9 million individuals (2001-2013) into semantically rich texts and predict individuals' residential mobility in later years (2013-2017). These life trajectories combine demographic information with annual changes in residence, work, education, income, and family circumstances, allowing us to assess how effectively such sequences support longitudinal prediction. We compare multiple NLP architectures (including LSTM, DistilBERT, BERT, and Qwen) and find that sequential and transformer-based models capture temporal and semantic structure more effectively than baseline models. The results show that textualized register data preserves meaningful information about individual pathways and supports complex, scalable modeling. Because few countries maintain longitudinal microdata with comparable coverage and precision, this dataset enables analyses and methodological tests that would be difficult or impossible elsewhere, offering a rigorous testbed for developing and evaluating new sequence-modeling approaches. Overall, our findings demonstrate that combining semantically rich register data with modern language models can substantially advance longitudinal analysis in social sciences.

Abstract: The sophistication of modern malware, specifically regarding communication with Command and Control (C2) servers, has rendered static blacklist-based defenses obsolete. The use of Domain Generation Algorithms (DGA) allows attackers to generate thousands of dynamic addresses daily, hindering blocking by traditional firewalls. This paper aims to propose and evaluate a method for detecting DGA domains using Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The methodology consisted of collecting a hybrid database containing 50,000 legitimate and 50,000 malicious domains, followed by the extraction of lexical features and the training of a Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM). Results demonstrated that while statistical entropy analysis is effective for simple DGAs, the Neural Network approach presents superiority in detecting complex patterns, reaching 97.2% accuracy and reducing the false positive rate in ambiguous lawful traffic scenarios.

Abstract: Recent studies show that using diffusion models for time series signal reconstruc- tion holds great promise. However, such approaches remain largely unexplored in the domain of medical time series. The unique characteristics of the physiological time series signals, such as multivariate, high temporal variability, highly noisy, and artifact-prone, make deep learning-based approaches still challenging for tasks such as imputation. Hence, we propose a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE)-based noise estimator within a score-based diffusion framework. Specifically, the Receptive Field Adaptive MoE (RFAMoE) module is designed to enable each channel to adap- tively select desired receptive fields throughout the diffusion process. Moreover, recent literature has found that when generating a physiological signal, performing multiple inferences and averaging the reconstructed signals can effectively reduce reconstruction errors, but at the cost of significant computational and latency over- head. We design a Fusion MoE module and innovatively leverage the nature of MoE module to generate K noise signals in parallel, fuse them using a routing mechanism, and complete signal reconstruction in a single inference step. This design not only improves performance over previous methods but also eliminates the substantial computational cost and latency associated with multiple inference processes. Extensive results demonstrate that our proposed framework consistently outperforms diffusion-based SOTA works on different tasks and datasets.

Conclusion: CRAG框架统一建模正常和风险行为，通过解耦表示和优化转换机制，为自动驾驶安全测试提供了可控风险场景生成的有效解决方案

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles (AV) requires rigorous testing under both everyday driving and rare, safety-critical conditions. A key challenge lies in simulating environment agents, including background vehicles (BVs) and vulnerable road users (VRUs), that behave realistically in nominal traffic while also exhibiting risk-prone behaviors consistent with real-world accidents. We introduce Controllable Risk Agent Generation (CRAG), a framework designed to unify the modeling of dominant nominal behaviors and rare safety-critical behaviors. CRAG constructs a structured latent space that disentangles normal and risk-related behaviors, enabling efficient use of limited crash data. By combining risk-aware latent representations with optimization-based mode-transition mechanisms, the framework allows agents to shift smoothly and plausibly from safe to risk states over extended horizons, while maintaining high fidelity in both regimes. Extensive experiments show that CRAG improves diversity compared to existing baselines, while also enabling controllable generation of risk scenarios for targeted and efficient evaluation of AV robustness.

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) offer a promising path toward interpretable machine learning: their learnable activations can be studied individually, while collectively fitting complex data accurately. In practice, however, trained activations often lack symbolic fidelity, learning pathological decompositions with no meaningful correspondence to interpretable forms. We propose Softly Symbolified Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (S2KAN), which integrate symbolic primitives directly into training. Each activation draws from a dictionary of symbolic and dense terms, with learnable gates that sparsify the representation. Crucially, this sparsification is differentiable, enabling end-to-end optimization, and is guided by a principled Minimum Description Length objective. When symbolic terms suffice, S2KAN discovers interpretable forms; when they do not, it gracefully degrades to dense splines. We demonstrate competitive or superior accuracy with substantially smaller models across symbolic benchmarks, dynamical systems forecasting, and real-world prediction tasks, and observe evidence of emergent self-sparsification even without regularization pressure.

Abstract: Given augmented views of each input graph, contrastive learning methods (e.g., InfoNCE) optimize pairwise alignment of graph embeddings across views while providing no mechanism to control the global structure of the view specific graph-of-graphs built from these embeddings. We introduce SpecMatch-CL, a novel loss function that aligns the view specific graph-of-graphs by minimizing the difference between their normalized Laplacians. Theoretically, we show that under certain assumptions, the difference between normalized Laplacians provides an upper bound not only for the difference between the ideal Perfect Alignment contrastive loss and the current loss, but also for the Uniformly loss. Empirically, SpecMatch-CL establishes new state of the art on eight TU benchmarks under unsupervised learning and semi-supervised learning at low label rates, and yields consistent gains in transfer learning on PPI-306K and ZINC 2M datasets.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a widely used tool for learning parts-based, low-dimensional representations of nonnegative data, with applications in vision, text, and bioinformatics. In clustering applications, orthogonal NMF (ONMF) variants further impose (approximate) orthogonality on the representation matrix so that its rows behave like soft cluster indicators. Existing algorithms, however, are typically derived from optimization viewpoints and do not explicitly exploit the conic geometry induced by NMF: data points lie in a convex cone whose extreme rays encode fundamental directions or "topics". In this work we revisit NMF from this geometric perspective and propose Cone Collapse, an algorithm that starts from the full nonnegative orthant and iteratively shrinks it toward the minimal cone generated by the data. We prove that, under mild assumptions on the data, Cone Collapse terminates in finitely many steps and recovers the minimal generating cone of $\mathbf{X}^\top$ . Building on this basis, we then derive a cone-aware orthogonal NMF model (CC-NMF) by applying uni-orthogonal NMF to the recovered extreme rays. Across 16 benchmark gene-expression, text, and image datasets, CC-NMF consistently matches or outperforms strong NMF baselines-including multiplicative updates, ANLS, projective NMF, ONMF, and sparse NMF-in terms of clustering purity. These results demonstrate that explicitly recovering the data cone can yield both theoretically grounded and empirically strong NMF-based clustering methods.

Abstract: Contrastive learning has emerged as a powerful method in deep learning, excelling at learning effective representations through contrasting samples from different distributions. However, dimensional collapse, where embeddings converge into a lower-dimensional space, poses a significant challenge, especially in semi-supervised and self-supervised setups. In this paper, we first identify a critical learning-rate threshold, beyond which standard contrastive losses converge to collapsed solutions. Building on these insights, we propose CLOP, a novel semi-supervised loss function designed to prevent dimensional collapse by promoting the formation of orthogonal linear subspaces among class embeddings. Through extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that CLOP improves performance in image classification and object detection tasks while also exhibiting greater stability across different learning rates and batch sizes.

Abstract: Efficient vision transformer remains a bottleneck for high-resolution images and long-video related real-world applications. Generalized Spatial Propagation Network (GSPN) addresses this by replacing quadratic self-attention with a line-scan propagation scheme, bringing the cost close to linear in the number of rows or columns, while retaining accuracy. Despite this advancement, the existing GSPN implementation still suffers from (i) heavy overhead due to repeatedly launching GPU kernels, (ii) excessive data transfers from global GPU memory, and (iii) redundant computations caused by maintaining separate propagation weights for each channel. We introduce GSPN-2, a joint algorithm-system redesign. In particular, we eliminate thousands of micro-launches from the previous implementation into one single 2D kernel, explicitly pin one warp to each channel slice, and stage the previous column's activations in shared memory. On the model side, we introduce a compact channel propagation strategy that replaces per-channel matrices, trimming parameters, and align naturally with the affinity map used in transformer attention. Experiments demonstrate GSPN-2's effectiveness across image classification and text-to-image synthesis tasks, matching transformer-level accuracy with significantly lower computational cost. GSPN-2 establishes a new efficiency frontier for modeling global spatial context in vision applications through its unique combination of structured matrix transformations and GPU-optimized implementation.

Abstract: Accurate tropical cyclones (TCs) tracking represents a critical challenge in the context of weather and climate science. Traditional tracking schemes mainly rely on subjective thresholds, which may introduce biases in their skills on the geographical region of application. We present ByteStorm, an efficient data-driven framework for reconstructing TC tracks without threshold tuning. It leverages deep learning networks to detect TC centers (via classification and localization), using only relative vorticity (850 mb) and mean sea-level pressure. Then, detected centers are linked into TC tracks through the BYTE algorithm. ByteStorm is evaluated against state-of-the-art deterministic trackers in the East- and West-North Pacific basins (ENP and WNP). The proposed framework achieves superior performance in terms of Probability of Detection ($85.05\%$ ENP, $79.48\%$ WNP), False Alarm Rate ($23.26\%$ ENP, $16.14\%$ WNP), and high Inter-Annual Variability correlations ($0.75$ ENP and $0.69$ WNP). These results highlight the potential of integrating deep learning and computer vision for fast and accurate TC tracking, offering a robust alternative to traditional approaches.

Conclusion: Brush算法能够有效地将规则逻辑融入符号回归模型，为开发数据驱动的临床风险评分提供了有前景的方法，在保持高预测性能的同时提高了模型的解释性。

Abstract: Medical decision-making makes frequent use of algorithms that combine risk equations with rules, providing clear and standardized treatment pathways. Symbolic regression (SR) traditionally limits its search space to continuous function forms and their parameters, making it difficult to model this decision-making. However, due to its ability to derive data-driven, interpretable models, SR holds promise for developing data-driven clinical risk scores. To that end we introduce Brush, an SR algorithm that combines decision-tree-like splitting algorithms with non-linear constant optimization, allowing for seamless integration of rule-based logic into symbolic regression and classification models. Brush achieves Pareto-optimal performance on SRBench, and was applied to recapitulate two widely used clinical scoring systems, achieving high accuracy and interpretable models. Compared to decision trees, random forests, and other SR methods, Brush achieves comparable or superior predictive performance while producing simpler models.

Abstract: Continual learning constrains models to learn new tasks over time without forgetting what they have already learned. A key challenge in this setting is catastrophic forgetting, where learning new information causes the model to lose its performance on previous tasks. Recently, explainable AI has been proposed as a promising way to better understand and reduce forgetting. In particular, self-explainable models are useful because they generate explanations during prediction, which can help preserve knowledge. However, most existing explainable approaches use post-hoc explanations or require additional memory for each new task, resulting in limited scalability. In this work, we introduce CIP-Net, an exemplar-free self-explainable prototype-based model designed for continual learning. CIP-Net avoids storing past examples and maintains a simple architecture, while still providing useful explanations and strong performance. We demonstrate that CIPNet achieves state-of-the-art performances compared to previous exemplar-free and self-explainable methods in both task- and class-incremental settings, while bearing significantly lower memory-related overhead. This makes it a practical and interpretable solution for continual learning.

Abstract: Time series forecasting has applications across domains and industries, especially in healthcare, but the technical expertise required to analyze data, build models, and interpret results can be a barrier to using these techniques. This article presents a web platform that makes the process of analyzing and plotting data, training forecasting models, and interpreting and viewing results accessible to researchers and clinicians. Users can upload data and generate plots to showcase their variables and the relationships between them. The platform supports multiple forecasting models and training techniques which are highly customizable according to the user's needs. Additionally, recommendations and explanations can be generated from a large language model that can help the user choose appropriate parameters for their data and understand the results for each model. The goal is to integrate this platform into learning health systems for continuous data collection and inference from clinical pipelines.

Abstract: Clinical decision-making in oncology requires predicting dynamic disease evolution, a task current static AI predictors cannot perform. While world models (WMs) offer a paradigm for generative prediction, existing medical applications remain limited. Existing methods often rely on stochastic diffusion models, focusing on visual reconstruction rather than causal, physiological transitions. Furthermore, in medical domain, models like MeWM typically ignore patient-specific temporal and clinical contexts and lack a feedback mechanism to link predictions to treatment decisions. To address these gaps, we introduce CLARITY, a medical world model that forecasts disease evolution directly within a structured latent space. It explicitly integrates time intervals (temporal context) and patient-specific data (clinical context) to model treatment-conditioned progression as a smooth, interpretable trajectory, and thus generate physiologically faithful, individualized treatment plans. Finally, CLARITY introduces a novel prediction-to-decision framework, translating latent rollouts into transparent, actionable recommendations. CLARITY demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in treatment planning. On the MU-Glioma-Post dataset, our approach outperforms recent MeWM by 12\%, and significantly surpasses all other medical-specific large language models.

TL;DR: LUNA通过可学习的核特征映射实现线性复杂度的注意力机制，在保持线性计算成本的同时达到甚至超越二次方注意力的精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统softmax注意力存在O(n²)的二次计算成本，限制了其在长序列领域的应用。现有线性注意力方法依赖固定随机特征映射，导致模型精度与计算效率之间的根本性权衡。

Method: LUNA采用核化的线性注意力机制，核心洞察是核特征映射本身应该是可学习的而非固定的。通过参数化核函数，LUNA学习特定数据和任务定制的特征基函数，并实现正定核和流式形式，获得序列长度上的线性时间和内存缩放。

Result: 在Long Range Arena评测中，LUNA在计算对等条件下（相同参数量、训练步数、近似FLOPs）达到高效Transformer中的最新平均精度。此外，在BERT和ViT-B/16模型的后验转换实验中，用LUNA替换softmax再微调能恢复大部分原始性能，显著优于固定线性化方法。

Conclusion: LUNA通过可学习的核特征映射消除了线性注意力的精度-效率权衡，在保持线性计算复杂度的同时实现了与二次方注意力相当的模型精度，为长序列处理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Scaling attention faces a critical bottleneck: the $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ quadratic computational cost of softmax attention, which limits its application in long-sequence domains. While linear attention mechanisms reduce this cost to $\mathcal{O}(n)$, they typically rely on fixed random feature maps, such as random Fourier features or hand-crafted functions. This reliance on static, data-agnostic kernels creates a fundamental trade-off, forcing practitioners to sacrifice significant model accuracy for computational efficiency. We introduce \textsc{LUNA}, a kernelized linear attention mechanism that eliminates this trade-off, retaining linear cost while matching and surpassing the accuracy of quadratic attention. \textsc{LUNA} is built on the key insight that the kernel feature map itself should be learned rather than fixed a priori. By parameterizing the kernel, \textsc{LUNA} learns a feature basis tailored to the specific data and task, overcoming the expressive limitations of fixed-feature methods. \textsc{Luna} implements this with a learnable feature map that induces a positive-definite kernel and admits a streaming form, yielding linear time and memory scaling in the sequence length. Empirical evaluations validate our approach across diverse settings. On the Long Range Arena (LRA), \textsc{Luna} achieves state-of-the-art average accuracy among efficient Transformers under compute parity, using the same parameter count, training steps, and approximate FLOPs. \textsc{Luna} also excels at post-hoc conversion: replacing softmax in fine-tuned BERT and ViT-B/16 checkpoints and briefly fine-tuning recovers most of the original performance, substantially outperforming fixed linearizations.

Abstract: We propose an interpretable deep competing risks model called the Deep Kernel Aalen-Johansen (DKAJ) estimator, which generalizes the classical Aalen-Johansen nonparametric estimate of cumulative incidence functions (CIFs). Each data point (e.g., patient) is represented as a weighted combination of clusters. If a data point has nonzero weight only for one cluster, then its predicted CIFs correspond to those of the classical Aalen-Johansen estimator restricted to data points from that cluster. These weights come from an automatically learned kernel function that measures how similar any two data points are. On four standard competing risks datasets, we show that DKAJ is competitive with state-of-the-art baselines while being able to provide visualizations to assist model interpretation.

Abstract: Crisis classification in social media aims to extract actionable disaster-related information from multimodal posts, which is a crucial task for enhancing situational awareness and facilitating timely emergency responses. However, the wide variation in crisis types makes achieving generalizable performance across unseen disasters a persistent challenge. Existing approaches primarily leverage deep learning to fuse textual and visual cues for crisis classification, achieving numerically plausible results under in-domain settings. However, they exhibit poor generalization across unseen crisis types because they 1. do not disentangle spurious and causal features, resulting in performance degradation under domain shift, and 2. fail to align heterogeneous modality representations within a shared space, which hinders the direct adaptation of established single-modality domain generalization (DG) techniques to the multimodal setting. To address these issues, we introduce a causality-guided multimodal domain generalization (MMDG) framework that combines adversarial disentanglement with unified representation learning for crisis classification. The adversarial objective encourages the model to disentangle and focus on domain-invariant causal features, leading to more generalizable classifications grounded in stable causal mechanisms. The unified representation aligns features from different modalities within a shared latent space, enabling single-modality DG strategies to be seamlessly extended to multimodal learning. Experiments on the different datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves the best performance in unseen disaster scenarios.

Abstract: We study the expressivity of one-dimensional (1D) ReLU deep neural networks through the lens of their linear regions. For randomly initialized, fully connected 1D ReLU networks (He scaling with nonzero bias) in the infinite-width limit, we prove that the expected number of linear regions grows as $\sum_{i = 1}^L n_i + \mathop{o}\left(\sum_{i = 1}^L{n_i}\right) + 1$, where $n_\ell$ denotes the number of neurons in the $\ell$-th hidden layer. We also propose a function-adaptive notion of sparsity that compares the expected regions used by the network to the minimal number needed to approximate a target within a fixed tolerance.

TL;DR: 提出通过'忏悔'机制激发大语言模型诚实表达自身短板，利用独立于主答案的忏悔奖励训练模型主动承认错误，实验证明能有效提升模型在被掩盖错误时的诚实度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在报告自身行为和信念时可能存在不诚实行为，如夸大对事实陈述的信心或掩盖错误证据。这种不诚实可能源于强化学习中奖励塑造的挑战，导致训练过程无意中激励模型说谎或歪曲行为。需要通过某种方法让模型诚实表达其不足。

Method: 提出'忏悔'机制：在模型给出主答案后，请求模型提供自我报告式的忏悔输出，完整说明其遵守政策和指令的情况。忏悔训练中的奖励完全基于诚实度，不影响主答案奖励。通过确保忏悔奖励最大化的最简路径是承认错误而非掩盖错误，激励模型在忏悔中保持诚实。使用GPT-5-Thinking进行忏悔训练实验。

Result: 实验评估模型在幻觉、指令遵循、潜在欺骗行为和奖励篡改等分布外场景中的诚实度。发现当模型在主答案中说谎或掩盖不足时，通常能在忏悔中诚实承认这些行为，且忏悔诚实度随训练适度提升。忏悔机制支持多种推理时干预措施：监测、拒绝抽样和向用户提示问题。

Conclusion: 忏悔机制为激发大语言模型诚实表达自身局限性提供了可行方法，通过独立奖励机制有效激励模型承认错误而非掩盖错误，能在多种分布外场景中提升模型的诚实表现，并为后续干预措施提供基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be dishonest when reporting on their actions and beliefs -- for example, they may overstate their confidence in factual claims or cover up evidence of covert actions. Such dishonesty may arise due to the effects of reinforcement learning (RL), where challenges with reward shaping can result in a training process that inadvertently incentivizes the model to lie or misrepresent its actions.
  In this work we propose a method for eliciting an honest expression of an LLM's shortcomings via a self-reported *confession*. A confession is an output, provided upon request after a model's original answer, that is meant to serve as a full account of the model's compliance with the letter and spirit of its policies and instructions. The reward assigned to a confession during training is solely based on its honesty, and does not impact positively or negatively the main answer's reward. As long as the "path of least resistance" for maximizing confession reward is to surface misbehavior rather than covering it up, this incentivizes models to be honest in their confessions. Our findings provide some justification this empirical assumption, especially in the case of egregious model misbehavior.
  To demonstrate the viability of our approach, we train GPT-5-Thinking to produce confessions, and we evaluate its honesty in out-of-distribution scenarios measuring hallucination, instruction following, scheming, and reward hacking. We find that when the model lies or omits shortcomings in its "main" answer, it often confesses to these behaviors honestly, and this confession honesty modestly improves with training. Confessions can enable a number of inference-time interventions including monitoring, rejection sampling, and surfacing issues to the user.

Method: 提出基于动作块的模型基础强化学习（MAC）方法：1）使用动作块模型，通过预测动作序列而非单个动作来减少复合误差；2）采用拒绝采样从表达性行为策略中选取动作块，避免模型被分布外动作利用。

Result: 在包含高达1亿条转移数据的大规模数据集上进行实验，MAC在具有挑战性的长时域任务中表现出优异的性能，超越了其他离线模型基础强化学习算法。

Conclusion: MAC通过动作块建模和拒绝采样机制，有效解决了模型基础值扩展在长时域离线RL中的偏差-误差权衡问题，为处理复杂长时域任务提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we study whether model-based reinforcement learning (RL), in particular model-based value expansion, can provide a scalable recipe for tackling complex, long-horizon tasks in offline RL. Model-based value expansion fits an on-policy value function using length-n imaginary rollouts generated by the current policy and a learned dynamics model. While larger n reduces bias in value bootstrapping, it amplifies accumulated model errors over long horizons, degrading future predictions. We address this trade-off with an \emph{action-chunk} model that predicts a future state from a sequence of actions (an "action chunk") instead of a single action, which reduces compounding errors. In addition, instead of directly training a policy to maximize rewards, we employ rejection sampling from an expressive behavioral action-chunk policy, which prevents model exploitation from out-of-distribution actions. We call this recipe \textbf{Model-Based RL with Action Chunks (MAC)}. Through experiments on highly challenging tasks with large-scale datasets of up to 100M transitions, we show that MAC achieves the best performance among offline model-based RL algorithms, especially on challenging long-horizon tasks.

TL;DR: 本文研究了在评估LLM时如何选择最佳分类器（LLM-as-a-judge或人工标注者）用于估计期望/不期望行为的流行率。指出传统指标如准确率、精确率、F1分数对类别不平衡和正类选择的敏感性问题，提出使用尤登J统计量或其线性变换平衡准确率来选择分类器，能获得更稳健的模型比较结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型的严谨性依赖于通过比较期望或不期望行为的流行率来比较模型。这些流行率估计由分类器（LLM-as-a-judge或人工标注者）产生，使得分类器的选择成为可信评估的核心。传统评价指标对类别不平衡和正类选择的任意性敏感，可能导致选择会扭曲流行率估计的分类器。

Method: 理论证明尤登的J统计量与选择最佳分类器来比较模型的目的一致，并展示平衡准确率是J的等效线性变换。通过分析论证、实证示例和模拟来验证方法的有效性。

Result: 研究表明使用平衡准确率选择分类器能带来更好、更稳健的分类器选择结果，从而获得更可靠的LLM评估结果。

Conclusion: 在评估LLM时，应使用平衡准确率（或等效的尤登J统计量）而非传统指标来选择分类器，以提高模型比较的可靠性和鲁棒性。该方法解决了传统指标对类别不平衡的敏感性问题，为LLM评估中的分类器选择提供了更合适的度量标准。

Abstract: Rigorous evaluation of large language models (LLMs) relies on comparing models by the prevalence of desirable or undesirable behaviors, such as task pass rates or policy violations. These prevalence estimates are produced by a classifier, either an LLM-as-a-judge or human annotators, making the choice of classifier central to trustworthy evaluation. Common metrics used for this choice, such as Accuracy, Precision, and F1, are sensitive to class imbalance and to arbitrary choices of positive class, and can favor judges that distort prevalence estimates. We show that Youden's $J$ statistic is theoretically aligned with choosing the best judge to compare models, and that Balanced Accuracy is an equivalent linear transformation of $J$. Through both analytical arguments and empirical examples and simulations, we demonstrate how selecting judges using Balanced Accuracy leads to better, more robust classifier selection.

Abstract: Most post-training backdoor detection methods rely on attacked models exhibiting extreme outlier detection statistics for the target class of an attack, compared to non-target classes. However, these approaches may fail: (1) when some (non-target) classes are easily discriminable from all others, in which case they may naturally achieve extreme detection statistics (e.g., decision confidence); and (2) when the backdoor is subtle, i.e., with its features weak relative to intrinsic class-discriminative features. A key observation is that the backdoor target class has contributions to its detection statistic from both the backdoor trigger and from its intrinsic features, whereas non-target classes only have contributions from their intrinsic features. To achieve more sensitive detectors, we thus propose to suppress intrinsic features while optimizing the detection statistic for a given class. For non-target classes, such suppression will drastically reduce the achievable statistic, whereas for the target class the (significant) contribution from the backdoor trigger remains. In practice, we formulate a constrained optimization problem, leveraging a small set of clean examples from a given class, and optimizing the detection statistic while orthogonalizing with respect to the class's intrinsic features. We dub this plug-and-play approach Class Subspace Orthogonalization (CSO) and assess it against challenging mixed-label and adaptive attacks.

Abstract: Both model developers and policymakers seek to quantify and mitigate the risk of rapidly-evolving frontier artificial intelligence (AI) models, especially large language models (LLMs), to facilitate bioterrorism or access to biological weapons. An important element of such efforts is the development of model benchmarks that can assess the biosecurity risk posed by a particular model. This paper describes the first component of a novel Biothreat Benchmark Generation (BBG) Framework. The BBG approach is designed to help model developers and evaluators reliably measure and assess the biosecurity risk uplift and general harm potential of existing and future AI models, while accounting for key aspects of the threat itself that are often overlooked in other benchmarking efforts, including different actor capability levels, and operational (in addition to purely technical) risk factors. As a pilot, the BBG is first being developed to address bacterial biological threats only. The BBG is built upon a hierarchical structure of biothreat categories, elements and tasks, which then serves as the basis for the development of task-aligned queries. This paper outlines the development of this biothreat task-query architecture, which we have named the Bacterial Biothreat Schema, while future papers will describe follow-on efforts to turn queries into model prompts, as well as how the resulting benchmarks can be implemented for model evaluation. Overall, the BBG Framework, including the Bacterial Biothreat Schema, seeks to offer a robust, re-usable structure for evaluating bacterial biological risks arising from LLMs across multiple levels of aggregation, which captures the full scope of technical and operational requirements for biological adversaries, and which accounts for a wide spectrum of biological adversary capabilities.

Abstract: The growing prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI) in various applications underscores the need for agents that can successfully navigate and adapt to an ever-changing, open-ended world. A key challenge is ensuring these AI agents are robust, excelling not only in familiar settings observed during training but also effectively generalising to previously unseen and varied scenarios. In this thesis, we harness methodologies from open-endedness and multi-agent learning to train and evaluate robust AI agents capable of generalising to novel environments, out-of-distribution inputs, and interactions with other co-player agents. We begin by introducing MiniHack, a sandbox framework for creating diverse environments through procedural content generation. Based on the game of NetHack, MiniHack enables the construction of new tasks for reinforcement learning (RL) agents with a focus on generalisation. We then present Maestro, a novel approach for generating adversarial curricula that progressively enhance the robustness and generality of RL agents in two-player zero-sum games. We further probe robustness in multi-agent domains, utilising quality-diversity methods to systematically identify vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art, pre-trained RL policies within the complex video game football domain, characterised by intertwined cooperative and competitive dynamics. Finally, we extend our exploration of robustness to the domain of LLMs. Here, our focus is on diagnosing and enhancing the robustness of LLMs against adversarial prompts, employing evolutionary search to generate a diverse range of effective inputs that aim to elicit undesirable outputs from an LLM. This work collectively paves the way for future advancements in AI robustness, enabling the development of agents that not only adapt to an ever-evolving world but also thrive in the face of unforeseen challenges and interactions.

Motivation: 现有的语言识别工具在多语言系统（如聊天机器人和虚拟助手）中面临准确性挑战，特别是在音乐请求等复杂场景中，开源工具准确率不足而大语言模型成本过高。

Method: 采用轻量级Transformer架构和两级对比学习方法，结合实例级分离和类级对齐与自适应边界，为相近语言生成紧凑且分离良好的嵌入表示。

Result: 在Amazon Massive数据集和Song数据集上分别达到99.25%和98.15%的F1分数，超过Sonnet 3.5模型且参数减少10倍。

Conclusion: PolyLingua在保持高准确性的同时显著降低了计算成本，适合资源受限环境中的实时语言识别应用。

Abstract: Language identification is a crucial first step in multilingual systems such as chatbots and virtual assistants, enabling linguistically and culturally accurate user experiences. Errors at this stage can cascade into downstream failures, setting a high bar for accuracy. Yet, existing language identification tools struggle with key cases--such as music requests where the song title and user language differ. Open-source tools like LangDetect, FastText are fast but less accurate, while large language models, though effective, are often too costly for low-latency or low-resource settings. We introduce PolyLingua, a lightweight Transformer-based model for in-domain language detection and fine-grained language classification. It employs a two-level contrastive learning framework combining instance-level separation and class-level alignment with adaptive margins, yielding compact and well-separated embeddings even for closely related languages. Evaluated on two challenging datasets--Amazon Massive (multilingual digital assistant utterances) and a Song dataset (music requests with frequent code-switching)--PolyLingua achieves 99.25% F1 and 98.15% F1, respectively, surpassing Sonnet 3.5 while using 10x fewer parameters, making it ideal for compute- and latency-constrained environments.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training is crucial for aligning generative models with human preferences, but its prohibitive computational cost remains a major barrier to widespread adoption. We introduce \textbf{TreeGRPO}, a novel RL framework that dramatically improves training efficiency by recasting the denoising process as a search tree. From shared initial noise samples, TreeGRPO strategically branches to generate multiple candidate trajectories while efficiently reusing their common prefixes. This tree-structured approach delivers three key advantages: (1) \emph{High sample efficiency}, achieving better performance under same training samples (2) \emph{Fine-grained credit assignment} via reward backpropagation that computes step-specific advantages, overcoming the uniform credit assignment limitation of trajectory-based methods, and (3) \emph{Amortized computation} where multi-child branching enables multiple policy updates per forward pass. Extensive experiments on both diffusion and flow-based models demonstrate that TreeGRPO achieves \textbf{2.4$\times$ faster training} while establishing a superior Pareto frontier in the efficiency-reward trade-off space. Our method consistently outperforms GRPO baselines across multiple benchmarks and reward models, providing a scalable and effective pathway for RL-based visual generative model alignment.

Abstract: In our prior work, LayerPipe, we had introduced an approach to accelerate training of convolutional, fully connected, and spiking neural networks by overlapping forward and backward computation. However, despite empirical success, a principled understanding of how much gradient delay needs to be introduced at each layer to achieve desired level of pipelining was not addressed. This paper, LayerPipe2, fills that gap by formally deriving LayerPipe using variable delayed gradient adaptation and retiming. We identify where delays may be legally inserted and show that the required amount of delay follows directly from the network structure where inner layers require fewer delays and outer layers require longer delays. When pipelining is applied at every layer, the amount of delay depends only on the number of remaining downstream stages. When layers are pipelined in groups, all layers in the group share the same assignment of delays. These insights not only explain previously observed scheduling patterns but also expose an often overlooked challenge that pipelining implicitly requires storage of historical weights. We overcome this storage bottleneck by developing a pipeline--aware moving average that reconstructs the required past states rather than storing them explicitly. This reduces memory cost without sacrificing the accuracy guarantees that makes pipelined learning viable. The result is a principled framework that illustrates how to construct LayerPipe architectures, predicts their delay requirements, and mitigates their storage burden, thereby enabling scalable pipelined training with controlled communication computation tradeoffs.

Conclusion: MobileFineTuner为商品手机上的LLM微调提供了高效、可扩展且实用的解决方案，填补了该领域的空白。

Abstract: Mobile phones are the most ubiquitous end devices, generating vast amounts of human-authored data and serving as the primary platform for end-side applications. As high-quality public data for large language models (LLMs) approaches exhaustion, on-device fine-tuning provides an opportunity to leverage private user data while preserving privacy. However, existing approaches are predominantly simulation-based or rely on IoT devices and PCs, leaving commodity mobile phones largely unexplored. A key gap is the absence of an open-source framework that enables practical LLM fine-tuning on mobile phones. We present MobileFineTuner, a unified open-source framework that enables end-to-end LLM fine-tuning directly on commodity mobile phones. MobileFineTuner is designed for efficiency, scalability, and usability, supporting full-parameters fine-tuning (Full-FT) and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). To address the memory and energy limitations inherent to mobile phones, we introduce system-level optimizations including parameter sharding, gradient accumulation, and energy-aware computation scheduling. We demonstrate the practicality of MobileFineTuner by fine-tuning GPT-2, Gemma 3, and Qwen 2.5 on real mobile phones. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of the proposed optimizations and establish MobileFineTuner as a viable foundation for future research on on-device LLM training.

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了AdamW优化器中解耦权重衰减的设置，论证了解耦权重衰减应与学习率的平方（γ²）成正比，而非传统上与学习率γ成正比，从而实现了更稳定的权重范数和更好的训练动态控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AdamW相对Adam的性能优势源于解耦权重衰减，但长期以来权重衰减都被设为与学习率γ成正比，这种设定缺乏理论基础。最近有研究者基于稳态正交性论证提出权重衰减应与γ²成正比，但作者发现实际训练动态并不支持这种正交性解释。

Method: 作者提出了一个更简单的假设：在稳态时更新量与权重无关。基于此假设，推导出解耦权重衰减应与γ²成正比才能使权重范数保持稳定。同时针对Scion优化器，推导出小批量更新总贡献（TUC）更好由动量相关的有效学习率表征，其最优值具有可迁移性。

Result: 实证验证表明，解耦权重衰减∝γ²的设置能带来稳定的权重范数和梯度范数，使训练动态更可控，并提升了模型性能。此外，Scion优化器中TUC的有效学习率表征方法也得到了验证。

Conclusion: 本文为解耦权重衰减的设置提供了新的理论基础，证明其应与学习率的平方（γ²）而非线性比例（γ）成正比，这一改变能改善优化器的训练动态和模型性能，并为优化器设计提供了新的理论指导。

Abstract: Decoupled weight decay, solely responsible for the performance advantage of AdamW over Adam, has long been set to proportional to learning rate $γ$ without questioning. Some researchers have recently challenged such assumption and argued that decoupled weight decay should be set $\propto γ^2$ instead based on orthogonality arguments at steady state. To the contrary, we find that eliminating the contribution of the perpendicular component of the update to the weight norm leads to little change to the training dynamics. Instead, we derive that decoupled weight decay $\propto γ^2$ results in stable weight norm based on the simple assumption that updates become independent of the weights at steady state, regardless of the nature of the optimizer. Based on the same assumption, we derive and empirically verify that the Total Update Contribution (TUC) of a minibatch under the Scion optimizer is better characterized by the momentum-dependent effective learning rate whose optimal value transfers and we show that decoupled weight decay $\propto γ^2$ leads to stable weight and gradient norms and allows us to better control the training dynamics and improve the model performance.

Abstract: Capsule Networks (CapsNets) show exceptional graph representation capacity via dynamic routing and vectorized hierarchical representations, but they model the complex geometries of real\-world graphs poorly by fixed\-curvature space due to the inherent geodesical disconnectedness issues, leading to suboptimal performance. Recent works find that non\-Euclidean pseudo\-Riemannian manifolds provide specific inductive biases for embedding graph data, but how to leverage them to improve CapsNets is still underexplored. Here, we extend the Euclidean capsule routing into geodesically disconnected pseudo\-Riemannian manifolds and derive a Pseudo\-Riemannian Capsule Network (PR\-CapsNet), which models data in pseudo\-Riemannian manifolds of adaptive curvature, for graph representation learning. Specifically, PR\-CapsNet enhances the CapsNet with Adaptive Pseudo\-Riemannian Tangent Space Routing by utilizing pseudo\-Riemannian geometry. Unlike single\-curvature or subspace\-partitioning methods, PR\-CapsNet concurrently models hierarchical and cluster or cyclic graph structures via its versatile pseudo\-Riemannian metric. It first deploys Pseudo\-Riemannian Tangent Space Routing to decompose capsule states into spherical\-temporal and Euclidean\-spatial subspaces with diffeomorphic transformations. Then, an Adaptive Curvature Routing is developed to adaptively fuse features from different curvature spaces for complex graphs via a learnable curvature tensor with geometric attention from local manifold properties. Finally, a geometric properties\-preserved Pseudo\-Riemannian Capsule Classifier is developed to project capsule embeddings to tangent spaces and use curvature\-weighted softmax for classification. Extensive experiments on node and graph classification benchmarks show PR\-CapsNet outperforms SOTA models, validating PR\-CapsNet's strong representation power for complex graph structures.

We introduce SPROCKET (Selected Prototype Random Convolutional Kernel Transform), which implements a new feature engineering strategy based on prototypes. On a majority of the UCR and UEA Time Series Classification archives, SPROCKET achieves performance comparable to existing convolutional algorithms and the new MR-HY-SP ( MultiROCKET-HYDRA-SPROCKET) ensemble's average accuracy ranking exceeds HYDRA-MR, the previous best convolutional ensemble's performance. These experimental results demonstrate that prototype-based feature transformation can enhance both accuracy and robustness in time series classification.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) faces significant challenges in evolving environments, particularly regarding data heterogeneity and the rigidity of fixed network topologies. To address these issues, this paper proposes \textbf{SOFA-FL} (Self-Organizing Hierarchical Federated Learning with Adaptive Clustered Data Sharing), a novel framework that enables hierarchical federated systems to self-organize and adapt over time.
  The framework is built upon three core mechanisms: (1) \textbf{Dynamic Multi-branch Agglomerative Clustering (DMAC)}, which constructs an initial efficient hierarchical structure; (2) \textbf{Self-organizing Hierarchical Adaptive Propagation and Evolution (SHAPE)}, which allows the system to dynamically restructure its topology through atomic operations -- grafting, pruning, consolidation, and purification -- to adapt to changes in data distribution; and (3) \textbf{Adaptive Clustered Data Sharing}, which mitigates data heterogeneity by enabling controlled partial data exchange between clients and cluster nodes.
  By integrating these mechanisms, SOFA-FL effectively captures dynamic relationships among clients and enhances personalization capabilities without relying on predetermined cluster structures.

Motivation: 当前基于消息传递的GNN在处理大型知识图谱时存在扩展性限制，因为迭代的消息传递过程效率低下，尤其在mini-batch训练中，节点只能看到邻域的部分视图。

Method: 1. 引入预处理步骤，预计算捕获节点局部和全局结构的特征：a) Bloom过滤器紧凑编码局部邻域结构；b) TransE嵌入表示节点在图的全局位置。2. 将这些特征与任何领域特定特征融合，生成可融入任何GNN技术的节点特征向量。

Conclusion: gHAWK框架通过增强消息传递训练的structural priors，显著减少了内存使用、加速了收敛并提高了模型准确性，为大型知识图谱上的GNN训练提供了可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are a rich source of structured, heterogeneous data, powering a wide range of applications. A common approach to leverage this data is to train a graph neural network (GNN) on the KG. However, existing message-passing GNNs struggle to scale to large KGs because they rely on the iterative message passing process to learn the graph structure, which is inefficient, especially under mini-batch training, where a node sees only a partial view of its neighborhood. In this paper, we address this problem and present gHAWK, a novel and scalable GNN training framework for large KGs. The key idea is to precompute structural features for each node that capture its local and global structure before GNN training even begins. Specifically, gHAWK introduces a preprocessing step that computes: (a)~Bloom filters to compactly encode local neighborhood structure, and (b)~TransE embeddings to represent each node's global position in the graph. These features are then fused with any domain-specific features (e.g., text embeddings), producing a node feature vector that can be incorporated into any GNN technique. By augmenting message-passing training with structural priors, gHAWK significantly reduces memory usage, accelerates convergence, and improves model accuracy. Extensive experiments on large datasets from the Open Graph Benchmark (OGB) demonstrate that gHAWK achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and lower training time on both node property prediction and link prediction tasks, topping the OGB leaderboard for three graphs.

Abstract: Axis-aligned decision trees are fast and stable but struggle on datasets with rotated or interaction-dependent decision boundaries, where informative splits require linear combinations of features rather than single-feature thresholds. Oblique forests address this with per-node hyperplane splits, but at added computational cost and implementation complexity. We propose a simple alternative: JARF, Jacobian-Aligned Random Forests. Concretely, we first fit an axis-aligned forest to estimate class probabilities or regression outputs, compute finite-difference gradients of these predictions with respect to each feature, aggregate them into an expected Jacobian outer product that generalizes the expected gradient outer product (EGOP), and use it as a single global linear preconditioner for all inputs. This supervised preconditioner applies a single global rotation of the feature space, then hands the transformed data back to a standard axis-aligned forest, preserving off-the-shelf training pipelines while capturing oblique boundaries and feature interactions that would otherwise require many axis-aligned splits to approximate. The same construction applies to any model that provides gradients, though we focus on random forests and gradient-boosted trees in this work. On tabular classification and regression benchmarks, this preconditioning consistently improves axis-aligned forests and often matches or surpasses oblique baselines while improving training time. Our experimental results and theoretical analysis together indicate that supervised preconditioning can recover much of the accuracy of oblique forests while retaining the simplicity and robustness of axis-aligned trees.

Motivation: 联邦学习（FL）框架下协同训练全局模型时，现有方法可能导致模型收敛到‘尖锐最小值’，从而影响模型的泛化能力。本文旨在通过引入平坦性约束来改善这一状况。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging machine learning framework that enables multiple clients (coordinated by a server) to collaboratively train a global model by aggregating the locally trained models without sharing any client's training data. It has been observed in recent works that learning in a federated manner may lead the aggregated global model to converge to a 'sharp minimum' thereby adversely affecting the generalizability of this FL-trained model. Therefore, in this work, we aim to improve the generalization performance of models trained in a federated setup by introducing a 'flatness' constrained FL optimization problem. This flatness constraint is imposed on the top eigenvalue of the Hessian computed from the training loss. As each client trains a model on its local data, we further re-formulate this complex problem utilizing the client loss functions and propose a new computationally efficient regularization technique, dubbed 'MAN,' which Minimizes Activation's Norm of each layer on client-side models. We also theoretically show that minimizing the activation norm reduces the top eigenvalue of the layer-wise Hessian of the client's loss, which in turn decreases the overall Hessian's top eigenvalue, ensuring convergence to a flat minimum. We apply our proposed flatness-constrained optimization to the existing FL techniques and obtain significant improvements, thereby establishing new state-of-the-art.

Abstract: Datasets may contain observations with multiple labels. If the labels are not mutually exclusive, and if the labels vary greatly in frequency, obtaining a sample that includes sufficient observations with scarcer labels to make inferences about those labels, and which deviates from the population frequencies in a known manner, creates challenges. In this paper, we consider a multivariate Bernoulli distribution as our underlying distribution of a multi-label problem. We present a novel sampling algorithm that takes label dependencies into account. It uses observed label frequencies to estimate multivariate Bernoulli distribution parameters and calculate weights for each label combination. This approach ensures the weighted sampling acquires target distribution characteristics while accounting for label dependencies. We applied this approach to a sample of research articles from Web of Science labeled with 64 biomedical topic categories. We aimed to preserve category frequency order, reduce frequency differences between most and least common categories, and account for category dependencies. This approach produced a more balanced sub-sample, enhancing the representation of minority categories.

Abstract: The potential for rapidly-evolving frontier artificial intelligence (AI) models, especially large language models (LLMs), to facilitate bioterrorism or access to biological weapons has generated significant policy, academic, and public concern. Both model developers and policymakers seek to quantify and mitigate any risk, with an important element of such efforts being the development of model benchmarks that can assess the biosecurity risk posed by a particular model. This paper discusses the pilot implementation of the Bacterial Biothreat Benchmark (B3) dataset. It is the third in a series of three papers describing an overall Biothreat Benchmark Generation (BBG) framework, with previous papers detailing the development of the B3 dataset. The pilot involved running the benchmarks through a sample frontier AI model, followed by human evaluation of model responses, and an applied risk analysis of the results along several dimensions. Overall, the pilot demonstrated that the B3 dataset offers a viable, nuanced method for rapidly assessing the biosecurity risk posed by a LLM, identifying the key sources of that risk and providing guidance for priority areas of mitigation priority.

Abstract: Decoding brain states from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data is vital for advancing neuroscience and clinical applications. While traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches have made strides in leveraging the high-dimensional and complex nature of fMRI data, they often fail to utilize the contextual richness provided by Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) metadata. This paper presents a novel framework integrating transformer-based architectures with multimodal inputs, including fMRI data and DICOM metadata. By employing attention mechanisms, the proposed method captures intricate spatial-temporal patterns and contextual relationships, enhancing model accuracy, interpretability, and robustness. The potential of this framework spans applications in clinical diagnostics, cognitive neuroscience, and personalized medicine. Limitations, such as metadata variability and computational demands, are addressed, and future directions for optimizing scalability and generalizability are discussed.

Abstract: Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables policy optimization from static datasets but is inherently vulnerable to data poisoning attacks. Existing attack strategies typically rely on locally uniform perturbations, which treat all samples indiscriminately. This approach is inefficient, as it wastes the perturbation budget on low-impact samples, and lacks stealthiness due to significant statistical deviations. In this paper, we propose a novel Global Budget Allocation attack strategy. Leveraging the theoretical insight that a sample's influence on value function convergence is proportional to its Temporal Difference (TD) error, we formulate the attack as a global resource allocation problem. We derive a closed-form solution where perturbation magnitudes are assigned proportional to the TD-error sensitivity under a global L2 constraint. Empirical results on D4RL benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline strategies, achieving up to 80% performance degradation with minimal perturbations that evade detection by state-of-the-art statistical and spectral defenses.

Abstract: Accurate and uncertainty-aware degradation estimation is essential for predictive maintenance in safety-critical systems like rotating machinery with rolling-element bearings. Many existing uncertainty methods lack confidence calibration, are costly to run, are not distance-aware, and fail to generalize under out-of-distribution data. We introduce two distance-aware uncertainty methods for deterministic physics-guided neural networks: PG-SNGP, based on Spectral Normalization Gaussian Process, and PG-SNER, based on Deep Evidential Regression. We apply spectral normalization to the hidden layers so the network preserves distances from input to latent space. PG-SNGP replaces the final dense layer with a Gaussian Process layer for distance-sensitive uncertainty, while PG-SNER outputs Normal Inverse Gamma parameters to model uncertainty in a coherent probabilistic form. We assess performance using standard accuracy metrics and a new distance-aware metric based on the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, which measures how well predicted uncertainty tracks the distance between test and training samples. We also design a dynamic weighting scheme in the loss to balance data fidelity and physical consistency. We test our methods on rolling-element bearing degradation using the PRONOSTIA dataset and compare them with Monte Carlo and Deep Ensemble PGNNs. Results show that PG-SNGP and PG-SNER improve prediction accuracy, generalize reliably under OOD conditions, and remain robust to adversarial attacks and noise.

Abstract: Predicting the outcomes of professional basketball games, particularly in the National Basketball Association (NBA), has become increasingly important for coaching strategy, fan engagement, and sports betting. However, many existing prediction models struggle with concept drift, limited temporal context, and instability across seasons. To advance forecasting in this domain, we introduce a newly constructed longitudinal NBA dataset covering the 2004-05 to 2024-25 seasons and present a deep learning framework designed to model long-term performance trends. Our primary contribution is a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture that leverages an extended sequence length of 9,840 games equivalent to eight full NBA seasons to capture evolving team dynamics and season-over-season dependencies. We compare this model against several traditional Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) baselines, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The LSTM achieves the best performance across all metrics, with 72.35 accuracy, 73.15 precision and 76.13 AUC-ROC. These results demonstrate the importance of long-sequence temporal modeling in basketball outcome prediction and highlight the value of our new multi-season dataset for developing robust, generalizable NBA forecasting systems.

Motivation: 原有的FedProxGrad方法在非凸复合优化的群组公平联邦学习问题中，仅能收敛到噪声主导的平稳邻域，且收敛结果明确依赖于方差诱导的噪声底。这限制了算法的最终收敛质量，需要通过改进分析消除这一限制。

Abstract: Recent work \cite{arifgroup} introduced Federated Proximal Gradient \textbf{(\texttt{FedProxGrad})} for solving non-convex composite optimization problems in group fair federated learning. However, the original analysis established convergence only to a \textit{noise-dominated neighborhood of stationarity}, with explicit dependence on a variance-induced noise floor. In this work, we provide an improved asymptotic convergence analysis for a generalized \texttt{FedProxGrad}-type analytical framework with inexact local proximal solutions and explicit fairness regularization. We call this extended analytical framework \textbf{DS \texttt{FedProxGrad}} (Decay Step Size \texttt{FedProxGrad}). Under a Robbins-Monro step-size schedule \cite{robbins1951stochastic} and a mild decay condition on local inexactness, we prove that $\liminf_{r\to\infty} \mathbb{E}[\|\nabla F(\mathbf{x}^r)\|^2] = 0$, i.e., the algorithm is asymptotically stationary and the convergence rate does not depend on a variance-induced noise floor.

Abstract: Part qualification is crucial in additive manufacturing (AM) because it ensures that additively manufactured parts can be consistently produced and reliably used in critical applications. Part qualification aims at verifying that an additively manufactured part meets performance requirements; therefore, predicting the complex stress-strain behaviors of additively manufactured parts is critical. We develop a dynamic time warping (DTW)-transfer learning (TL) framework for additive manufacturing part qualification by transferring knowledge of the stress-strain behaviors of additively manufactured low-cost polymers to metals. Specifically, the framework employs DTW to select a polymer dataset as the source domain that is the most relevant to the target metal dataset. Using a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, four source polymers (i.e., Nylon, PLA, CF-ABS, and Resin) and three target metals (i.e., AlSi10Mg, Ti6Al4V, and carbon steel) that are fabricated by different AM techniques are utilized to demonstrate the effectiveness of the DTW-TL framework. Experimental results show that the DTW-TL framework identifies the closest match between polymers and metals to select one single polymer dataset as the source domain. The DTW-TL model achieves the lowest mean absolute percentage error of 12.41% and highest coefficient of determination of 0.96 when three metals are used as the target domain, respectively, outperforming the vanilla LSTM model without TL as well as the TL model pre-trained on four polymer datasets as the source domain.

Abstract: Text-to-image (TTI) diffusion models have achieved remarkable visual quality, yet they have been repeatedly shown to exhibit social biases across sensitive attributes such as gender, race and age. To mitigate these biases, existing approaches frequently depend on curated prompt datasets - either manually constructed or generated with large language models (LLMs) - as part of their training and/or evaluation procedures. Beside the curation cost, this also risks overlooking unanticipated, less obvious prompts that trigger biased generation, even in models that have undergone debiasing. In this work, we introduce Bias-Guided Prompt Search (BGPS), a framework that automatically generates prompts that aim to maximize the presence of biases in the resulting images. BGPS comprises two components: (1) an LLM instructed to produce attribute-neutral prompts and (2) attribute classifiers acting on the TTI's internal representations that steer the decoding process of the LLM toward regions of the prompt space that amplify the image attributes of interest. We conduct extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and a state-of-the-art debiased model and discover an array of subtle and previously undocumented biases that severely deteriorate fairness metrics. Crucially, the discovered prompts are interpretable, i.e they may be entered by a typical user, quantitatively improving the perplexity metric compared to a prominent hard prompt optimization counterpart. Our findings uncover TTI vulnerabilities, while BGPS expands the bias search space and can act as a new evaluation tool for bias mitigation.

Abstract: The advancement of human healthspan and bioengineering relies heavily on predicting the behavior of complex biological systems. While high-throughput multiomics data is becoming increasingly abundant, converting this data into actionable predictive models remains a bottleneck. High-capacity, datadriven simulation systems are critical in this landscape; unlike classical mechanistic models restricted by prior knowledge, these architectures can infer latent interactions directly from observational data, allowing for the simulation of temporal trajectories and the anticipation of downstream intervention effects in personalized medicine and synthetic biology. To address this challenge, we introduce Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) as a dynamic framework for learning the complex interplay between the proteome and metabolome. We applied this framework to time-series data derived from engineered Escherichia coli strains, modeling the continuous dynamics of metabolic pathways. The proposed NODE architecture demonstrates superior performance in capturing system dynamics compared to traditional machine learning pipelines. Our results show a greater than 90% improvement in root mean squared error over baselines across both Limonene (up to 94.38% improvement) and Isopentenol (up to 97.65% improvement) pathway datasets. Furthermore, the NODE models demonstrated a 1000x acceleration in inference time, establishing them as a scalable, high-fidelity tool for the next generation of metabolic engineering and biological discovery.

Abstract: Early graph prompt tuning approaches relied on task-specific designs for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), limiting their adaptability across diverse pre-training strategies. In contrast, another promising line of research has investigated universal graph prompt tuning, which operates directly in the input graph's feature space and builds a theoretical foundation that universal graph prompt tuning can theoretically achieve an equivalent effect of any prompting function, eliminating dependence on specific pre-training strategies. Recent works propose selective node-based graph prompt tuning to pursue more ideal prompts. However, we argue that selective node-based graph prompt tuning inevitably compromises the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning. In this paper, we strengthen the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning by introducing stricter constraints, demonstrating that adding prompts to all nodes is a necessary condition for achieving the universality of graph prompts. To this end, we propose a novel model and paradigm, Learning and Editing Universal GrAph Prompt Tuning (LEAP), which preserves the theoretical foundation of universal graph prompt tuning while pursuing more ideal prompts. Specifically, we first build the basic universal graph prompts to preserve the theoretical foundation and then employ actor-critic reinforcement learning to select nodes and edit prompts. Extensive experiments on graph- and node-level tasks across various pre-training strategies in both full-shot and few-shot scenarios show that LEAP consistently outperforms fine-tuning and other prompt-based approaches.

Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on large data have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot generalization capabilities across domains. Building on the success of TabPFN for tabular data and its recent extension to time series, we investigate whether graph node classification can be effectively reformulated as a tabular learning problem. We introduce TabPFN-GN, which transforms graph data into tabular features by extracting node attributes, structural properties, positional encodings, and optionally smoothed neighborhood features. This enables TabPFN to perform direct node classification without any graph-specific training or language model dependencies. Our experiments on 12 benchmark datasets reveal that TabPFN-GN achieves competitive performance with GNNs on homophilous graphs and consistently outperforms them on heterophilous graphs. These results demonstrate that principled feature engineering can bridge the gap between tabular and graph domains, providing a practical alternative to task-specific GNN training and LLM-dependent graph foundation models.

Abstract: Uplift modeling estimates the causal effect of an intervention as the difference between potential outcomes under treatment and control, whereas counterfactual identification aims to recover the joint distribution of these potential outcomes (e.g., "Would this customer still have churned had we given them a marketing offer?"). This joint counterfactual distribution provides richer information than the uplift but is harder to estimate. However, the two approaches are synergistic: uplift models can be leveraged for counterfactual estimation. We propose a counterfactual estimator that fits a bivariate beta distribution to predicted uplift scores, yielding posterior distributions over counterfactual outcomes. Our approach requires no causal assumptions beyond those of uplift modeling. Simulations show the efficacy of the approach, which can be applied, for example, to the problem of customer churn in telecom, where it reveals insights unavailable to standard ML or uplift models alone.

Abstract: With the increasing reliance on AI models for weather forecasting, it is imperative to evaluate their vulnerability to adversarial perturbations. This work introduces Weather Adaptive Adversarial Perturbation Optimization (WAAPO), a novel framework for generating targeted adversarial perturbations that are both effective in manipulating forecasts and stealthy to avoid detection. WAAPO achieves this by incorporating constraints for channel sparsity, spatial localization, and smoothness, ensuring that perturbations remain physically realistic and imperceptible. Using the ERA5 dataset and FourCastNet (Pathak et al. 2022), we demonstrate WAAPO's ability to generate adversarial trajectories that align closely with predefined targets, even under constrained conditions. Our experiments highlight critical vulnerabilities in AI-driven forecasting models, where small perturbations to initial conditions can result in significant deviations in predicted weather patterns. These findings underscore the need for robust safeguards to protect against adversarial exploitation in operational forecasting systems.

Abstract: TD($λ$) with function approximation has proved empirically successful for some complex reinforcement learning problems. For linear approximation, TD($λ$) has been shown to minimise the squared error between the approximate value of each state and the true value. However, as far as policy is concerned, it is error in the relative ordering of states that is critical, rather than error in the state values. We illustrate this point, both in simple two-state and three-state systems in which TD($λ$)--starting from an optimal policy--converges to a sub-optimal policy, and also in backgammon. We then present a modified form of TD($λ$), called STD($λ$), in which function approximators are trained with respect to relative state values on binary decision problems. A theoretical analysis, including a proof of monotonic policy improvement for STD($λ$) in the context of the two-state system, is presented, along with a comparison with Bertsekas' differential training method [1]. This is followed by successful demonstrations of STD($λ$) on the two-state system and a variation on the well known acrobot problem.

Abstract: We propose a text-to-IMU (inertial measurement unit) motion-synthesis framework to obtain realistic IMU data by fine-tuning a pretrained diffusion model with an acceleration-based second-order loss (L_acc). L_acc enforces consistency in the discrete second-order temporal differences of the generated motion, thereby aligning the diffusion prior with IMU-specific acceleration patterns. We integrate L_acc into the training objective of an existing diffusion model, finetune the model to obtain an IMU-specific motion prior, and evaluate the model with an existing text-to-IMU framework that comprises surface modelling and virtual sensor simulation. We analysed acceleration signal fidelity and differences between synthetic motion representation and actual IMU recordings. As a downstream application, we evaluated Human Activity Recognition (HAR) and compared the classification performance using data of our method with the earlier diffusion model and two additional diffusion model baselines. When we augmented the earlier diffusion model objective with L_acc and continued training, L_acc decreased by 12.7% relative to the original model. The improvements were considerably larger in high-dynamic activities (i.e., running, jumping) compared to low-dynamic activities~(i.e., sitting, standing). In a low-dimensional embedding, the synthetic IMU data produced by our refined model shifts closer to the distribution of real IMU recordings. HAR classification trained exclusively on our refined synthetic IMU data improved performance by 8.7% compared to the earlier diffusion model and by 7.6% over the best-performing comparison diffusion model. We conclude that acceleration-aware diffusion refinement provides an effective approach to align motion generation and IMU synthesis and highlights how flexible deep learning pipelines are for specialising generic text-to-motion priors to sensor-specific tasks.

TL;DR: Fed-SE 框架通过本地自进化与全局低秩子空间聚合相结合，解决 FL 在 LLM 智能体开放式进化中的梯度冲突和负迁移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习主要针对静态数据集优化，但在 LLM 智能体部署中，面临异构任务、稀疏轨迹奖励和隐私约束等挑战，直接应用标准 FL 会导致梯度冲突和全局优化不稳定。

Method: Fed-SE 采用本地进化-全局聚合范式：本地通过参数高效微调处理高回报轨迹实现稳定梯度更新；全局在低秩子空间内聚合更新，解耦环境特定动态以减少客户端间负迁移。

Result: 在五个异构环境实验中，Fed-SE 相比联邦基线平均任务成功率提升约 18%，验证了其在隐私受限部署中实现鲁棒跨环境知识迁移的有效性。

Conclusion: Fed-SE 为隐私约束下 LLM 智能体的开放式自进化提供了一种有效的联邦学习框架，通过本地稳定优化和全局解耦聚合解决了异构任务环境中的知识迁移难题。

Abstract: LLM agents are widely deployed in complex interactive tasks, yet privacy constraints often preclude centralized optimization and co-evolution across dynamic environments. While Federated Learning (FL) has proven effective on static datasets, its extension to the open-ended self-evolution of agents remains underexplored. Directly applying standard FL is challenging: heterogeneous tasks and sparse, trajectory-level rewards introduce severe gradient conflicts, destabilizing the global optimization process. To bridge this gap, we propose Fed-SE, a Federated Self-Evolution framework for LLM agents. Fed-SE establishes a local evolution-global aggregation paradigm. Locally, agents employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning on filtered, high-return trajectories to achieve stable gradient updates. Globally, Fed-SE aggregates updates within a low-rank subspace that disentangles environment-specific dynamics, effectively reducing negative transfer across clients. Experiments across five heterogeneous environments demonstrate that Fed-SE improves average task success rates by approximately 18% over federated baselines, validating its effectiveness in robust cross-environment knowledge transfer in privacy-constrained deployments.

Conclusion: 揭示了基于LLM的表格数据生成的独特隐私漏洞，需要有效的防御机制，提出的数字扰动策略展现出良好的防御效果

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable performance in generating high-quality tabular synthetic data. In practice, two primary approaches have emerged for adapting LLMs to tabular data generation: (i) fine-tuning smaller models directly on tabular datasets, and (ii) prompting larger models with examples provided in context. In this work, we show that popular implementations from both regimes exhibit a tendency to compromise privacy by reproducing memorized patterns of numeric digits from their training data. To systematically analyze this risk, we introduce a simple No-box Membership Inference Attack (MIA) called LevAtt that assumes adversarial access to only the generated synthetic data and targets the string sequences of numeric digits in synthetic observations. Using this approach, our attack exposes substantial privacy leakage across a wide range of models and datasets, and in some cases, is even a perfect membership classifier on state-of-the-art models. Our findings highlight a unique privacy vulnerability of LLM-based synthetic data generation and the need for effective defenses. To this end, we propose two methods, including a novel sampling strategy that strategically perturbs digits during generation. Our evaluation demonstrates that this approach can defeat these attacks with minimal loss of fidelity and utility of the synthetic data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的漂移感知在线高斯过程学习器，旨在在线性环境下适应分布漂移，并克服传统在线线性模型在概念漂移检测及应对能力上的短板。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实数据流往往存在概念漂移，若模型不能及时适应会导致预测性能下降。现有在线高斯过程模型在处理动态分布漂移、固定超参数缺乏自适应调整、缺乏理论支撑的衰退机制以及内存效率低等方面存在不足，亟待解决。

Method: 作者提出了DAO-GP模型：一种完全自适应的、无需人为调整超参数且具备稀疏性的在线非参数回归模型。该模型引入漂移检测与自适应机制，根据漂移程度动态调整模型行为，并进行基于内存的高效管理和衰退式更新。

Result: 实验验证中，DAO-GP在各种静态条件、多种漂移类型（突发、增量、渐进）及不同数据特性下均表现出鲁棒性。与前沿参数模型和非参数模型相比，DAO-GP取得同等或更优的性能，显示出其对概念漂移的抵抗能力。

Conclusion: DAO-GP成功解决了传统在线高斯过程模型中关于漂移感知、超参数固定、数据泄露、缺乏衰退机制及内存效率低等问题，成为一种稳健、自适应的在线非线性回归解决方案，为处理动态变化的数据分布提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Real-world datasets often exhibit temporal dynamics characterized by evolving data distributions. Disregarding this phenomenon, commonly referred to as concept drift, can significantly diminish a model's predictive accuracy. Furthermore, the presence of hyperparameters in online models exacerbates this issue. These parameters are typically fixed and cannot be dynamically adjusted by the user in response to the evolving data distribution. Gaussian Process (GP) models offer powerful non-parametric regression capabilities with uncertainty quantification, making them ideal for modeling complex data relationships in an online setting. However, conventional online GP methods face several critical limitations, including a lack of drift-awareness, reliance on fixed hyperparameters, vulnerability to data snooping, absence of a principled decay mechanism, and memory inefficiencies. In response, we propose DAO-GP (Drift-Aware Online Gaussian Process), a novel, fully adaptive, hyperparameter-free, decayed, and sparse non-linear regression model. DAO-GP features a built-in drift detection and adaptation mechanism that dynamically adjusts model behavior based on the severity of drift. Extensive empirical evaluations confirm DAO-GP's robustness across stationary conditions, diverse drift types (abrupt, incremental, gradual), and varied data characteristics. Analyses demonstrate its dynamic adaptation, efficient in-memory and decay-based management, and evolving inducing points. Compared with state-of-the-art parametric and non-parametric models, DAO-GP consistently achieves superior or competitive performance, establishing it as a drift-resilient solution for online non-linear regression.

Abstract: Kernel density estimation is a key component of a wide variety of algorithms in machine learning, Bayesian inference, stochastic dynamics and signal processing. However, the unsupervised density estimation technique requires tuning a crucial hyperparameter: the kernel bandwidth. The choice of bandwidth is critical as it controls the bias-variance trade-off by over- or under-smoothing the topological features. Topological data analysis provides methods to mathematically quantify topological characteristics, such as connected components, loops, voids et cetera, even in high dimensions where visualization of density estimates is impossible. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning approach using a topology-based loss function for the automated and unsupervised selection of the optimal bandwidth and benchmark it against classical techniques -- demonstrating its potential across different dimensions.

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) offers a powerful path toward discovering sustainable polymer materials, but progress has been limited by the lack of large, high-quality, and openly accessible polymer datasets. The Open Polymer Challenge (OPC) addresses this gap by releasing the first community-developed benchmark for polymer informatics, featuring a dataset with 10K polymers and 5 properties: thermal conductivity, radius of gyration, density, fractional free volume, and glass transition temperature. The challenge centers on multi-task polymer property prediction, a core step in virtual screening pipelines for materials discovery. Participants developed models under realistic constraints that include small data, label imbalance, and heterogeneous simulation sources, using techniques such as feature-based augmentation, transfer learning, self-supervised pretraining, and targeted ensemble strategies. The competition also revealed important lessons about data preparation, distribution shifts, and cross-group simulation consistency, informing best practices for future large-scale polymer datasets. The resulting models, analysis, and released data create a new foundation for molecular AI in polymer science and are expected to accelerate the development of sustainable and energy-efficient materials. Along with the competition, we release the test dataset at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexliu99/neurips-open-polymer-prediction-2025-test-data.

Abstract: This article investigates on the improvement and stabilization of alternating current (AC) and direct current (DC) output voltages in a Permanent Magnet Synchronous Generator (PMSG) driven by a vertical-axis tidal turbine using advanced control strategies. The research integrates artificial intelligence (AI)-based techniques to enhance voltage stability and efficiency. Initially, the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) approach based on Tip Speed Ratio (TSR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Fuzzy logic controllers is explored. To further optimize the performance, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and a hybrid ANN-PSO methodology are implemented. These strategies aim to refine the reference rotational speed of the turbine while minimizing deviations from optimal power extraction conditions. The simulation results of a tidal turbine operating at a water flow velocity of 1.5 m/s demonstrate that the PSO-based control approach significantly enhances the voltage stability compared to conventional MPPT-TSR and ANN-Fuzzy controllers. The hybrid ANN-PSO technique improves the voltage regulation by dynamically adapting to system variations and providing real-time reference speed adjustments. This research highlights the AI-based hybrid optimization benefit to stabilize the output voltage of tidal energy systems, thereby increasing reliability and efficiency in renewable energy applications.

Abstract: Efficient edge caching reduces latency and alleviates backhaul congestion in modern networks. Traditional caching policies, such as Least Recently Used (LRU) and Least Frequently Used (LFU), perform well under specific request patterns. LRU excels in workloads with strong temporal locality, while LFU is effective when content popularity remains static. However, real-world client requests often exhibit correlations due to shared contexts and coordinated activities. This is particularly evident in Virtual Reality (VR) environments, where groups of clients navigate shared virtual spaces, leading to correlated content requests.
  In this paper, we introduce the \textit{grouped client request model}, a generalization of the Independent Reference Model that explicitly captures different types of request correlations. Our theoretical analysis of LRU under this model reveals that the optimal causal caching policy depends on cache size: LFU is optimal for small to moderate caches, while LRU outperforms it for larger caches. To address the limitations of existing policies, we propose Least Following and Recently Used (LFRU), a novel online caching policy that dynamically infers and adapts to causal relationships in client requests to optimize evictions. LFRU prioritizes objects likely to be requested based on inferred dependencies, achieving near-optimal performance compared to the offline optimal Belady policy in structured correlation settings.
  We develop VR based datasets to evaluate caching policies under realistic correlated requests. Our results show that LFRU consistently performs at least as well as LRU and LFU, outperforming LRU by up to 2.9x and LFU by up to1.9x in certain settings.

Abstract: International Telecommunications Union (ITU) defined Next Generation Network (NGN) underlies most wireline and wireless packet-based telecommunications networks. A key design principle of NGN is decoupling of service-related functions from the underlying transport stratum, making user services independent of transport technologies. Interestingly, the NGN architecture, as defined in ITU standards, did not follow this design principle for internal network services, e.g., mobility, or authentication though adhering for external user services like IPTV or Multimedia services. These internal services are handled by the NGN transport control plane, making them an intrinsic part of the transport stratum, resulting in a tightly coupled service and transport functionality as opposed to the proclaimed design goal. This design choice may force each transport technology to support internal services individually, e.g., separate authentication service for each transport, leading to duplication. Since the NGN architecture is the base underlying architecture for most packet-based telecommunications network including advanced cellular networks like 4th/5th Generation cellular networks, the limitation persists in these cellular networks as well. To remedy the situation, the decoupling of service and transport can be generalized to include internal services like mobility and authentication also. In this context, the recently published ITU Y.2325 recommendation, defines an evolved NGN architecture, wherein all services, including internal network services, are decoupled from the transport stratum. The proposal results in a more scalable and modular evolved NGN architecture that can be used as a template for all future telecom networks including IMT-2030 (6th generation mobile networks). In this article, we review the evolved NGN architecture, as proposed in ITU-T Y.2325.

Motivation: 维基媒体站点（如维基百科）的匿名编辑政策使其意外成为IPv6地址的时间胶囊——未登录用户的IP地址被记录为用户名。这为研究人员提供了跨越二十多年的时间戳IPv6地址数据集，可用于研究地址分配及其时空变化。

Method: 从维基媒体站点（包括维基百科）提取2003-2024年间编辑者使用的1900万个独特IPv6地址，基于这些地址数据进行多维度分析。

Result: 收集了1900万个独特IPv6地址的历史数据，研究了IPv6在不同国家/地区（对应维基媒体站点语言）的普及情况、IPv6采用随时间增长的趋势，以及客户端设备（台式机、笔记本电脑、移动电话）中EUI-64寻址方式的流行度。

Conclusion: 维基媒体站点提供的历史IPv6地址数据为研究IPv6地址分配的长期时空演变提供了独特视角，能够深入分析IPv6采用趋势和技术实现特征。

Abstract: Due to their article editing policies, Wikimedia sites like Wikipedia have become inadvertent time capsules for IPv6 addresses. When Wikimedia users make edits without signing into an account, their IP addresses are used in lieu of a username. Wikimedia site dumps therefore provide researchers with over two decades worth of timestamped client IPv6 addresses to understand address assignments and how they have changed over time and space.
  In this work, we extract 19M unique IPv6 addresses from Wikimedia sites like Wikipedia that were used by editors from 2003 to 2024. We use these addresses to understand the prevalence of IPv6 in countries corresponding to Wikimedia site languages, how IPv6 adoption has grown over time, and the prevalence of EUI-64 addressing on client devices like desktops, laptops, and mobile phones.

*Rohan Goyal,Venkatesan Guruswami*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 研究者提出了折叠里德-所罗门码（FRS码）和单变重数码的高效列表恢复算法，虽然理论上列表尺寸随误差增大会指数增长，但通过揭示列表的高度结构性，可以输出紧凑描述来包含相关列表，并将运行时间优化到与1/ε多项式相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 列表恢复是编码理论和理论计算机科学中的一个基本概念，已有研究表明FRS码等线性码在接近容量（误差分数接近1-R）时，列表尺寸会指数增长，这意味着无法在多项式时间内完成列表恢复。这激发了研究者探索如何利用列表的结构特性来克服这一限制。

Method: 扩展了Ashvinkumar、Habib和Srivastava在列表解码方面的算法进展，揭示即使列表尺寸很大，它们也具有高度结构性。提出一种方法，可以输出一个紧凑描述的集合（大小为ℓ^O((log ℓ)/ε)），该集合包含了相关列表，且运行时间仅与1/ε多项式相关。改进了Guruswami和Wang之前的工作，后者描述的紧凑集合大小约为n^(ℓ/ε)。

Result: 成功开发了高效算法，能够输出仅包含ℓ^O((log ℓ)/ε)大小的紧凑描述集合，同时运行时间仅与1/ε多项式相关，显著改进了之前的已知结果。同时，在列表恢复任务上也优于现有的算法结果。

Conclusion: 通过利用列表的高度结构性，研究者克服了FRS码和单变重数码在接近容量时列表恢复中列表尺寸指数增长的限制，提出了运行时间与1/ε多项式相关的算法，并输出了更紧凑的集合描述，推动了列表恢复任务的发展。

Abstract: List recovery of error-correcting codes has emerged as a fundamental notion with broad applications across coding theory and theoretical computer science. Folded Reed-Solomon (FRS) and univariate multiplicity codes are explicit constructions which can be efficiently list-recovered up to capacity, namely a fraction of errors approaching $1-R$ where $R$ is the code rate.
  Chen and Zhang and related works showed that folded Reed-Solomon codes and linear codes must have list sizes exponential in $1/ε$ for list-recovering from an error-fraction $1-R-ε$. These results suggest that one cannot list-recover FRS codes in time that is also polynomial in $1/ε$. In contrast to such limitations, we show, extending algorithmic advances of Ashvinkumar, Habib, and Srivastava for list decoding, that even if the lists in the case of list-recovery are large, they are highly structured. In particular, we can output a compact description of a set of size only $\ell^{O((\log \ell)/ε)}$ which contains the relevant list, while running in time only polynomial in $1/ε$ (the previously known compact description due to Guruswami and Wang had size $\approx n^{\ell/ε}$). We also improve on the state-of-the-art algorithmic results for the task of list-recovery.

Motivation: EP算法中的消息可能出现无限积分值和负方差情况，这些虽然符合EP框架，但会阻碍算法收敛进程，特别是在高斯投影EP中影响算法效率。

Method: 1) 分析线性模型中EP消息与信念之间的关系；2) 提出非持久性和持久性两种方法来避免算法被无限积分值的消息阻塞；3) 开发额外方法完全防止无限积分值消息的产生。

Result: 基于线性模型中EP消息关系的分析，开发出了一套能够防止算法被负方差消息阻塞的有效方法，提高了EP算法在处理线性模型时的稳定性和收敛性。

Conclusion: 通过对线性模型中EP消息传递机制的深入分析，提出了多种解决方案来应对负方差消息问题，为改善EP算法在特定场景下的性能提供了理论和方法支持。

Abstract: Expectation Propagation (EP) is a widely used message-passing algorithm that decomposes a global inference problem into multiple local ones. It approximates marginal distributions (beliefs) using intermediate functions (messages). While beliefs must be proper probability distributions that integrate to one, messages may have infinite integral values. In Gaussian-projected EP, such messages take a Gaussian form and appear as if they have "negative" variances. Although allowed within the EP framework, these negative-variance messages can impede algorithmic progress.
  In this paper, we investigate EP in linear models and analyze the relationship between the corresponding beliefs. Based on the analysis, we propose both non-persistent and persistent approaches that prevent the algorithm from being blocked by messages with infinite integral values.
  Furthermore, by examining the relationship between the EP messages in linear models, we develop an additional approach that avoids the occurrence of messages with infinite integral values.

Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of the adaptive matched filtering (AMF) in cluttered environments, particularly when operating with superimposed signals. Since the instantaneous signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) is a random variable dependent on the data payload, using it directly as a design objective poses severe practical challenges, such as prohibitive computational burdens and signaling overhead. To address this, we propose shifting the optimization objective from an instantaneous to a statistical metric, which focuses on maximizing the average SCNR over all possible payloads. Due to its analytical intractability, we leverage tools from random matrix theory (RMT) to derive an asymptotic approximation for the average SCNR, which remains accurate even in moderate-dimensional regimes. A key finding from our theoretical analysis is that, for a fixed modulation basis, the PSK achieves a superior average SCNR compared to QAM and the pure Gaussian constellation. Furthermore, for any given constellation, the OFDM achieves a higher average SCNR than SC and AFDM. Then, we propose two pilot design schemes to enhance system performance: a Data-Payload-Dependent (DPD) scheme and a Data-Payload-Independent (DPI) scheme. The DPD approach maximizes the instantaneous SCNR for each transmission. Conversely, the DPI scheme optimizes the average SCNR, offering a flexible trade-off between sensing performance and implementation complexity. Then, we develop two dedicated optimization algorithms for DPD and DPI schemes. In particular, for the DPD problem, we employ fractional optimization and the KKT conditions to derive a closed-form solution. For the DPI problem, we adopt a manifold optimization approach to handle the inherent rank-one constraint efficiently. Simulation results validate the accuracy of our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Abstract: This paper investigates the fundamental tradeoff between communication and quickest change detection (QCD) in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems under a monostatic setup. We introduce a novel Joint Communication and quickest Change subblock coding Strategy (JCCS) that leverages feedback to adapt coding dynamically based on real-time state estimation. The achievable rate-delay region is characterized using state-dependent mutual information and KL divergence, providing a comprehensive framework for analyzing the interplay between communication performance and detection delay. Moreover, we provide a partial converse demonstrating the asymptotic optimality of the proposed detection algorithm within the JCCS framework. To illustrate the practical implications, we analyze binary and MIMO Gaussian channels, revealing insights into achieving optimal tradeoffs in ISAC system design.

Abstract: This paper provides a fundamental characterization of the discrete ambiguity functions (AFs) of random communication waveforms under arbitrary orthonormal modulation with random constellation symbols, which serve as a key metric for evaluating the delay-Doppler sensing performance in future ISAC applications. A unified analytical framework is developed for two types of AFs, namely the discrete periodic AF (DP-AF) and the fast-slow time AF (FST-AF), where the latter may be seen as a small-Doppler approximation of the DP-AF. By analyzing the expectation of squared AFs, we derive exact closed-form expressions for both the expected sidelobe level (ESL) and the expected integrated sidelobe level (EISL) under the DP-AF and FST-AF formulations. For the DP-AF, we prove that the normalized EISL is identical for all orthogonal waveforms. To gain structural insights, we introduce a matrix representation based on the finite Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) group, where each delay-Doppler shift corresponds to a WH operator acting on the ISAC signal. This WH-group viewpoint yields sharp geometric constraints on the lowest sidelobes: The minimum ESL can only occur along a one-dimensional cut or over a set of widely dispersed delay-Doppler bins. Consequently, no waveform can attain the minimum ESL over any compact two-dimensional region, leading to a no-optimality (no-go) result under the DP-AF framework. For the FST-AF, the closed-form ESL and EISL expressions reveal a constellation-dependent regime governed by its kurtosis: The OFDM modulation achieves the minimum ESL for sub-Gaussian constellations, whereas the OTFS waveform becomes optimal for super-Gaussian constellations.

Abstract: We extend the existing skew polynomial representations of matrix algebras which are direct sum of matrix spaces over division rings. In this representation, the sum-rank distance between two tuples of matrices is captured by a weight function on their associated skew polynomials, defined through degrees and greatest common right divisors with the polynomial that defines the representation. We exploit this representation to construct new families of maximum sum-rank distance (MSRD) codes over finite and infinite fields, and over division rings. These constructions generalize many of the known existing constructions of MSRD codes as well as of optimal codes in the rank and in the Hamming metric. As a byproduct, in the case of finite fields we obtain new families of MDS codes which are linear over a subfield and whose length is close to the field size.

Method: 提出了FlowSteer(FS)方案，这是一种操作感知的条件调度方法，在采样路径中注入测量先验，将冻结流模型的隐式引导与显式测量约束耦合。利用流模型的噪声敏感性特性设计调度器，无需重新训练模型或添加适配器。

Result: 在超分辨率、去模糊、去噪和着色等任务中，FlowSteer在严格零样本设置下提升了测量一致性和身份保持能力。实现了更高保真度的重建图像，同时充分利用了流模型的丰富生成先验。

Conclusion: FlowSteer虽然简单，但有效提升了流模型在图像修复任务中的测量保真度，通过创新的条件调度方案解决了生成漂移问题，展示了在不解结模型、不添加适配器的情况下高效操作现有流模型能力的可行性。

Abstract: Flow-based text-to-image (T2I) models excel at prompt-driven image generation, but falter on Image Restoration (IR), often "drifting away" from being faithful to the measurement. Prior work mitigate this drift with data-specific flows or task-specific adapters that are computationally heavy and not scalable across tasks. This raises the question "Can't we efficiently manipulate the existing generative capabilities of a flow model?" To this end, we introduce FlowSteer (FS), an operator-aware conditioning scheme that injects measurement priors along the sampling path,coupling a frozed flow's implicit guidance with explicit measurement constraints. Across super-resolution, deblurring, denoising, and colorization, FS improves measurement consistency and identity preservation in a strictly zero-shot setting-no retrained models, no adapters. We show how the nature of flow models and their sensitivities to noise inform the design of such a scheduler. FlowSteer, although simple, achieves a higher fidelity of reconstructed images, while leveraging the rich generative priors of flow models.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of cancerous lesions from 3D computed tomography (CT) scans is essential for automated treatment planning and response assessment. However, even state-of-the-art models combining self-supervised learning (SSL) pretrained transformers with convolutional decoders are susceptible to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, generating confidently incorrect tumor segmentations, posing risks for safe clinical deployment. Existing logit-based methods suffer from task-specific model biases, while architectural enhancements to explicitly detect OOD increase parameters and computational costs. Hence, we introduce a plug-and-play and lightweight post-hoc random forests-based OOD detection framework called RF-Deep that leverages deep features with limited outlier exposure. RF-Deep enhances generalization to imaging variations by repurposing the hierarchical features from the pretrained-then-finetuned backbone encoder, providing task-relevant OOD detection by extracting the features from multiple regions of interest anchored to the predicted tumor segmentations. Hence, it scales to images of varying fields-of-view. We compared RF-Deep against existing OOD detection methods using 1,916 CT scans across near-OOD (pulmonary embolism, negative COVID-19) and far-OOD (kidney cancer, healthy pancreas) datasets. RF-Deep achieved AUROC > 93.50 for the challenging near-OOD datasets and near-perfect detection (AUROC > 99.00) for the far-OOD datasets, substantially outperforming logit-based and radiomics approaches. RF-Deep maintained similar performance consistency across networks of different depths and pretraining strategies, demonstrating its effectiveness as a lightweight, architecture-agnostic approach to enhance the reliability of tumor segmentation from CT volumes.

Abstract: This paper proposes an encrypted state observer that is capable of detecting sensor attacks without decryption. We first design a state observer that operates over a finite field of integers with the modular arithmetic. The observer generates a residue signal that indicates the presence of attacks under sparse attack and sensing redundancy conditions. Then, we develop a homomorphic encryption scheme that enables the observer to operate over encrypted data while automatically disclosing the residue signal. Unlike our previous work restricted to single-input single-output systems, the proposed scheme is applicable to general multi-input multi-output systems. Given that the disclosed residue signal remains below a prescribed threshold, the full state can be recovered as an encrypted message.

Abstract: Reliable optimal control is challenging when the dynamics of a nonlinear system are unknown and only infrequent, noisy output measurements are available. This work addresses this setting of limited sensing by formulating a Bayesian prior over the continuous-time dynamics and latent state trajectory in state-space form and updating it through a targeted marginal Metropolis-Hastings sampler equipped with a numerical ODE integrator. The resulting posterior samples are used to formulate a scenario-based optimal control problem that accounts for both model and measurement uncertainty and is solved using standard nonlinear programming methods. The approach is validated in a numerical case study on glucose regulation using a Type 1 diabetes model.

Abstract: This study investigates how the layout and density of seats in aircraft cabins influence the pricing of airline tickets on domestic flights. The analysis is based on microdata from boarding passes linked to face-to-face interviews with passengers, allowing us to relate the price paid to the location on the aircraft seat map, as well as market characteristics and flight operations. Econometric models were estimated using the Post-Double-Selection LASSO (PDS-LASSO) procedure, which selects numerous controls for unobservable factors linked to commercial and operational aspects, thus enabling better identification of the effect of variables such as advance purchase, reason for travel, fuel price, market structure, and load factor, among others. The results suggest that a higher density of seat rows is associated with lower prices, reflecting economies of scale with the increase in aircraft size and gains in operational efficiency. An unexpected result was also obtained: in situations where there was no seat selection fee, passengers with more expensive tickets were often allocated middle seats due to purchasing at short notice, when the side alternatives were no longer available. This behavior helps explain the economic logic behind one of the main ancillary revenues of airlines. In addition to quantitative analysis, the study incorporates an exploratory approach to innovative cabin concepts and their possible effects on density and comfort on board.

Abstract: This paper proposes a hybrid energy storage system (HESS)-based control framework that enables comprehensive power smoothing for hyperscale AI datacenters with large load variations. Datacenters impose severe ramping and fluctuation-induced stresses on the grid frequency and voltage stability. To mitigate such disturbances, the proposed HESS integrates a battery energy storage system (BESS) and a supercapacitor (SC) through coordinated multi-timescale control. A high-pass filter (HPF) separates the datacenter demand into slow and fast components, allocating them respectively to the ESS via a leaky-integral controller and to the SC via a phase-lead proportional-derivative controller enhanced with feedforward and ramp-tracking compensation. Adaptive weighting and repetitive control mechanisms further improve transient and periodic responses. Case studies verify that the proposed method effectively suppresses both ramping and fluctuations, stabilizes the system frequency, and maintains sustainable state-of-charge (SoC) trajectories for both ESS and SC under prolonged, stochastic training cycles.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个两阶段机器学习框架来预测航班延误，通过建模延误吸收机制显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精准预测航班起飞延误对提升运营效率和缓解连锁延误至关重要。传统方法常将上游延误视为静态变量，忽略了决定延误是否被吸收或传递的动态恢复过程。

Method: 研究采用两阶段框架：第一阶段用CatBoost分类器基于运营、时间和气象特征估计航班吸收上游延误的概率（AbsorbScore）；第二阶段用XGBoost分类器整合AbsorbScore与时刻表、天气和拥堵指标来预测航班是否延误超过15分钟。

Result: 使用2023年夏季美国国内航班和NOAA天气数据，该框架相比基线模型显著提升，ROC-AUC从0.865提高到0.898，识别延误航班的精确度达89.2%。

Conclusion: 结果表明，将延误吸收建模为中间机制能显著改善预测性能，并提供对机场恢复动态的可解释性见解，为数据驱动的延误管理和主动运营规划提供实用基础。

Abstract: Accurately forecasting flight departure delays is essential for improving operational efficiency and mitigating the cascading disruptions that propagate through tightly coupled aircraft rotations. Traditional machine learning approaches often treat upstream delays as static variables, overlooking the dynamic recovery processes that determine whether a delay is absorbed or transmitted to subsequent legs. This study introduces a two-stage machine learning framework that explicitly models delay-absorption behavior and incorporates it into downstream delay prediction. In Stage I, a CatBoost classifier estimates the probability that a flight successfully absorbs an upstream delay based on operational, temporal, and meteorological features. This probability, termed AbsorbScore, quantifies airport- and flight-specific resilience to delay propagation. In Stage II, an XGBoost classifier integrates AbsorbScore with schedule, weather, and congestion indicators to predict whether a flight will depart more than 15 minutes late. Using U.S. domestic flight and NOAA weather data from Summer 2023, the proposed framework achieves substantial improvements over baseline models, increasing ROC-AUC from 0.865 to 0.898 and enhancing precision to 89.2% in identifying delayed flights. The results demonstrate that modeling delay absorption as an intermediate mechanism significantly improves predictive performance and yields interpretable insights into airport recovery dynamics, offering a practical foundation for data-driven delay management and proactive operational planning.

Abstract: Optimal pulse patterns (OPPs) are a modulation technique in which a switching signal is computed offline through an optimization process that accounts for selected performance criteria, such as current harmonic distortion. The optimization determines both the switching angles (i.e., switching times) and the pattern structure (i.e., the sequence of voltage levels). This optimization task is a challenging mixed-integer nonconvex problem, involving integer-valued voltage levels and trigono metric nonlinearities in both the objective and the constraints. We address this challenge by reinterpreting OPP design as a periodic mode-selecting optimal control problem of a hybrid system, where selecting angles and levels corresponds to choosing jump times in a transition graph. This time-domain formulation enables the direct use of convex-relaxation techniques from optimal control, producing a hierarchy of semidefinite programs that lower-bound the minimal achievable harmonic distortion and scale subquadratically with the number of converter levels and switching angles. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approachs

Abstract: This paper develops a theoretical framework for the design of Active Split-Ring Resonators (ASRRs). An ASRR is a Split-Ring Resonator (SRR) equipped with a tunable negative resistor, enabling both switchability and quality factor boosting and tuning. These properties make ASRRs well-suited for integration into dense arrays on silicon chips, where pixelated near-fields are generated and leveraged for high-resolution 2D imaging of samples. Such imagers pave the way for real-time, non-invasive, and low-cost imaging of human body tissue. The paper investigates ASRR coupling to host transmission lines, nonlinear effects, signal flow, and the influence of various noise sources on detection performance. Verified through simulations, these studies provide design guidelines for optimizing the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and power consumption of a single pixel, while adhering to the constraints of a scalable array.

Abstract: Cooperative platooning, enabled by cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC), is a cornerstone technology for connected automated vehicles (CAVs), offering significant improvements in safety, comfort, and traffic efficiency over traditional adaptive cruise control (ACC). This paper addresses a key challenge in the initial deployment phase of CAVs: the limited benefits of cooperative platooning due to the sparse distribution of CAVs on the road. To overcome this limitation, we propose an innovative control framework that enhances cooperative platooning in mixed traffic environments. Two techniques are utilized: (1) a mixed cooperative platooning strategy that integrates CACC with unconnected vehicles (CACCu), and (2) a strategic lane-change decision model designed to facilitate safe and efficient lane changes for platoon formation. Additionally, a surrounding vehicle identification system is embedded in the framework to enable CAVs to effectively identify and select potential platooning leaders. Simulation studies across various CV market penetration rates (MPRs) show that incorporating CACCu systems significantly improves safety, comfort, and traffic efficiency compared to existing systems with only CACC and ACC systems, even at CV penetration as low as 10%. The maximized platoon formation increases by up to 24%, accompanied by an 11% reduction in acceleration and a 7% decrease in fuel consumption. Furthermore, the strategic lane-change model enhances CAV performance, achieving notable improvements between 6% and 60% CV penetration, without adversely affecting overall traffic flow.

Abstract: Time delays in communication channels present significant challenges for bilateral teleoperation systems, affecting both transparency and stability. Although traditional wave variable-based methods for a four-channel architecture ensure stability via passivity, they remain vulnerable to wave reflections and disturbances like variable delays and environmental noise. This article presents a data-driven hybrid framework that replaces the conventional wave-variable transform with an ensemble of three advanced sequence models, each optimized separately via the state-of-the-art Optuna optimizer, and combined through a stacking meta-learner. The base predictors include an LSTM augmented with Prophet for trend correction, an LSTM-based feature extractor paired with clustering and a random forest for improved regression, and a CNN-LSTM model for localized and long-term dynamics. Experimental validation was performed in Python using data generated from the baseline system implemented in MATLAB/Simulink. The results show that our optimized ensemble achieves a transparency comparable to the baseline wave-variable system under varying delays and noise, while ensuring stability through passivity constraints.

Abstract: In this paper, an MPC for tracking formulation is proposed for the control of anesthesia dynamics. It seamlessly enables the optimization of the steady-states pair that is not unique due to the MISO nature of the model. Anesthesia dynamics is a multi-time scale system with two types of states characterized, respectively, by fast and slow dynamics. In anesthesia control, the output equation depends only on the fast dynamics. Therefore, the slow states can be treated as disturbances, and compensation terms can be introduced. Subsequently, the system can be reformulated as a nominal one allowing the design of an MPC for tracking strategy. The presented framework ensures recursive feasibility and asymptotic stability, through the design of appropriate terminal ingredients in the MPC for tracking framework. The controller performance is then assessed on a patient in a simulation environment.

Abstract: This study proposes a systematic design procedure for determining the quantization gain and the security parameter in the Confidential Fictitious Reference Iterative Tuning (CFRIT), enabling overflow-free and accuracy-guaranteed encrypted controller tuning. Within an encrypted data-driven gain tuning, the range of quantization errors induced during the encoding (encryption) process can be estimated from operational data. Based on this insight, explicit analytical conditions on the quantization gain and the security parameter are derived to prevent overflow in computing over encrypted data. Furthermore, the analysis reveals a quantitative relationship between quantization-induced errors and the deviation between the gains obtained by CFRIT and non-confidential Fictitious Reference Iterative Tuning (FRIT), clarifying how parameter choice affects tuning accuracy. A numerical example verifies the proposed procedure by demonstrating that the designed parameters achieve accurate encrypted tuning within a prescribed tolerance while preventing overflow. In addition, the admissible region of parameter combinations is visualized to examine the characteristics of feasible and infeasible regions, providing practical insights into parameter design for encrypted data-driven control.

Abstract: Modern power networks face increasing vulnerability to cascading failures due to high complexity and the growing penetration of intermittent resources, necessitating rigorous security assessment beyond the conventional $N-1$ criterion. Current approaches often struggle to achieve the computational tractability required for exhaustive $N-2$ contingency analysis integrated with complex stability evaluations like small-signal stability. Addressing this computational bottleneck and the limitations of deterministic screening, this paper presents a scalable methodology for the vulnerability assessment of modern power networks, integrating $N-2$ contingency analysis with small-signal stability evaluation. To prioritize critical components, we propose a probabilistic \textbf{Risk Index ($R_i$)} that weights the deterministic \textit{severity} of a contingency (including optimal power flow divergence, islanding, and oscillatory instability) by the \textit{failure frequency} of the involved elements based on reliability data. The proposed framework is implemented using High-Performance Computing (HPC) techniques through the PyCOMPSs parallel programming library, orchestrating optimal power flow simulations (VeraGrid) and small-signal analysis (STAMP) to enable the exhaustive exploration of massive contingency sets. The methodology is validated on the IEEE 118-bus test system, processing more than \num{57000} scenarios to identify components prone to triggering cascading failures. Results demonstrate that the risk-based approach effectively isolates critical assets that deterministic $N-1$ criteria often overlook. This work establishes a replicable and efficient workflow for probabilistic security assessment, suitable for large-scale networks and capable of supporting operator decision-making in near real-time environments.

TL;DR: 研究带有行为反馈的SIR传染病模型中的最优控制问题，证明'填箱策略'在一般条件下是最优控制策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SIR模型假设感染率恒定，无法充分考虑个体适应性行为（如自愿社交距离、佩戴口罩）对传染病传播的影响。需要建立能够反映这种内生性适应机制的模型，并研究在此类模型下的最优控制策略。

Method: 建立行为反馈SIR模型，其中感染率取决于易感者和感染者的比例。在此基础上构建最优控制问题，目标是在无限时间范围内将感染曲线控制在阈值以下，同时最小化干预成本。利用模型的动态特性，证明'填箱策略'在一般感染率条件下是最优控制。

Result: 证明了在一般条件下，'填箱策略'（先让传染病自由传播直至达到阈值，然后施加最小控制使感染人数保持在阈值，直至基本再生数小于1后自然消退）是该模型的最优控制策略。该结果将经典SIR模型下的已知结果推广到包含行为反馈的更一般情况。

Conclusion: 研究增强了对具有适应性行为的传染病管理的理解，为稳健的遏制策略提供了理论依据。'填箱策略'的最优性为公共卫生政策制定提供了理论支持，特别是当个体行为会随着疫情发展而自适应调整时。

Abstract: We consider a behavioral-feedback SIR epidemic model, in which the infection rate depends in feedback on the fractions of susceptible and infected agents, respectively. The considered model allows one to account for endogenous adaptation mechanisms of the agents in response to the epidemics, such as voluntary social distancing, or the adoption of face masks. For this model, we formulate an optimal control problem for a social planner that has the ability to reduce the infection rate to keep the infection curve below a certain threshold within an infinite time horizon, while minimizing the intervention cost. Based on the dynamic properties of the model, we prove that, under quite general conditions on the infection rate, the \emph{filling the box} strategy is the optimal control. This strategy consists in letting the epidemics spread without intervention until the threshold is reached, then applying the minimum control that leaves the fraction of infected individuals constantly at the threshold until the reproduction number becomes less than one and the infection naturally fades out. Our result generalizes one available in the literature for the equivalent problem formulated for the classical SIR model, which can be recovered as a special case of our model when the infection rate is constant. Our contribution enhances the understanding of epidemic management with adaptive human behavior, offering insights for robust containment strategies.

Abstract: This article presents a systematic method for designing time-varying Control Barrier Functions (CBF) composed of a time-invariant component and multiple time-dependent components, leveraging structural properties of the system dynamics. The method involves the construction of a specific class of time-invariant CBFs that encode the system's dynamic capabilities with respect to a given constraint, and augments them subsequently with appropriately designed time-dependent transformations. While transformations uniformly varying the time-invariant CBF can be applied to arbitrary systems, transformations exploiting structural properties in the dynamics - equivariances in particular - enable the handling of a broader and more expressive class of time-varying constraints. The article shows how to leverage such properties in the design of time-varying CBFs. The proposed method decouples the design of time variations from the computationally expensive construction of the underlying CBFs, thereby providing a computationally attractive method to the design of time-varying CBFs. The method accounts for input constraints and under-actuation, and requires only qualitative knowledge on the time-variation of the constraints making it suitable to the application in uncertain environments.

Conclusion: 该方法为单基站部署提供了一种实用且鲁棒的解决方案，在NLoS环境下具有亚米级定位精度的潜力。

Abstract: Accurate outdoor localization in Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) environments remains a critical challenge for wireless communication and sensing systems. Existing methods, including positioning based on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and triple Base Stations (BSs) techniques, cannot provide reliable performance under NLoS conditions, particularly in dense urban areas with strong multipath effects. To address this limitation, we propose a single BS localization framework that integrates sequential signal measurements with prior radio information embedded in the Radio Map (RM). Using temporal measurement features and matching them with radio maps, the proposed method effectively mitigates the adverse impact of multipath propagation and reduces the dependence on LoS paths. Simulation experiments further evaluate the impact of different radio map construction strategies and the varying lengths of the measurement sequence on localization accuracy. Results demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves sub-meter positioning accuracy in typical NLoS environments, highlighting its potential as a practical and robust solution for single-base-station deployment.

Abstract: Scaled model experiments are commonly used in various engineering fields to reduce experimentation costs and overcome constraints associated with full-scale systems. The relevance of such experiments relies on dimensional analysis and the principle of dynamic similarity. However, transferring controllers to full-scale systems often requires additional tuning. In this paper, we propose a method to enable a direct controller transfer using dimensionless model predictive control, tuned automatically for closed-loop performance. With this reformulation, the closed-loop behavior of an optimized controller transfers directly to a new, dynamically similar system. Additionally, the dimensionless formulation allows for the use of data from systems of different scales during parameter optimization. We demonstrate the method on a cartpole swing-up and a car racing problem, applying either reinforcement learning or Bayesian optimization for tuning the controller parameters. Software used to obtain the results in this paper is publicly available at https://github.com/josipkh/dimensionless-mpcrl.

Abstract: Preliminary mission design of low-thrust spacecraft trajectories in the Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem is a global search characterized by a complex objective landscape and numerous local minima. Formulating the problem as sampling from an unnormalized distribution supported on neighborhoods of locally optimal solutions, provides the opportunity to deploy Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and generative machine learning. In this work, we extend our previous self-supervised diffusion model fine-tuning framework to employ gradient-informed Markov chain Monte Carlo. We compare two algorithms - the Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo - both initialized from a distribution learned by a diffusion model. Derivatives of an objective function that balances fuel consumption, time of flight and constraint violations are computed analytically using state transition matrices. We show that incorporating the gradient drift term accelerates mixing and improves convergence of the Markov chain for a multi-revolution transfer in the Saturn-Titan system. Among the evaluated methods, MALA provides the best trade-off between performance and computational cost. Starting from samples generated by a baseline diffusion model trained on a related transfer, MALA explicitly targets Pareto-optimal solutions. Compared to a random walk Metropolis algorithm, it increases the feasibility rate from 17.34% to 63.01% and produces a denser, more diverse coverage of the Pareto front. By fine-tuning a diffusion model on the generated samples and associated reward values with reward-weighted likelihood maximization, we learn the global solution structure of the problem and eliminate the need for a tedious separate data generation phase.

Abstract: The success of large language models LLMs amplifies the need for highthroughput energyefficient inference at scale. 3DDRAMbased accelerators provide high memory bandwidth and therefore an opportunity to accelerate the bandwidthbound decode phase. However, how to adequately balance compute density for prefill with bandwidthcapacity for decode remains open. Moreover, most prior designs do not target endtoend serving, leaving the codesign of dataflow, parallel mapping, and scheduling underexplored. To bridge the gap, we present LaMoSys3.5D, to our knowledge the first scalable 3.5DIC architecture for LLM serving. LaMoSys3.5D composes heterogeneous 3DDRAM chiplets on a 2.5D interposer: computerich chiplets for prefill and bandwidthcapacityrich chiplets for decode. To realize efficient serving, we adopt a hardwaresoftware codesign spanning dataflow, parallel mapping, and introduce a thermalaware modeling and hierarchical designspace exploration framework. Across diverse LLMs and workloads, LaMoSys3.5D improves throughputperwatt over DGXA100 systems by 62 and achieves a 4.87 better endtoend latency geomean versus prior 3D designs. We further distill intriguing design guidelines for 3.5DIC architectures and endtoend inference serving.

Abstract: Post-harvest losses due to subjective quality assessment cause significant damage to the economy and food safety, especially in countries like Bangladesh. To mitigate such damages, objective decision-making backed by scientific methods is necessary. An IoT-based, cost-effective quality monitoring system can provide a solution by going beyond subjective quality monitoring and decision-making practices. Here, we propose a low-power, cost-effective fruit quality monitoring system with an array of MQ gas sensors, which can be used as an electronic nose. We track the volatile gas emissions, specifically ethanol, methane, and ammonia, encompassing both ripening and decomposition for a set of bananas. Based on the gas concentration thresholds, we develop a mathematical model to accurately assess fruit quality. We also integrate this information into a dashboard for prompt decision-making and monitoring to make it useful to the farmers. This approach has the potential to reduce economic losses, enhance food safety, and provide scalable solutions for the supply chain.

TL;DR: 该研究通过对比面向数据设计(DOD)与传统面向对象设计(OOD)在A*搜索算法中的性能表现，发现DOD在多线程环境下能提供更好的缓存利用效率和执行速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多核CPU与主存性能差距的日益扩大，需要硬件感知的软件设计范式来优化性能。研究旨在分析DOD与OOD在缓存利用和多线程环境效率方面的差异。

Method: 开发并比较了A*搜索算法的四个版本：单线程OOD、单线程DOD、多线程OOD、多线程DOD。评估指标包括执行时间、内存使用量和CPU缓存未命中数。

Result: 在多线程测试中，DOD实现表现出显著性能优势，执行时间更快，系统调用和缓存未命中更少。对于A*这类细粒度任务，单线程版本反而在多线程管理开销下优于多线程版本。

Conclusion: 即使在简单算法中性能差异看似不大，但DOD在关键指标上的一致优势证明了其架构优越性，表明它是复杂大规模AI和并行计算任务中最大化硬件效率的更有效方法。

Abstract: The growing performance gap between multi-core CPUs and main memory necessitates hardware-aware software design paradigms. This study provides a comprehensive performance analysis of Data Oriented Design (DOD) versus the traditional Object-Oriented Design (OOD), focusing on cache utilization and efficiency in multi-threaded environments. We developed and compared four distinct versions of the A* search algorithm: single-threaded OOD (ST-OOD), single-threaded DOD (ST-DOD), multi-threaded OOD (MT-OOD), and multi-threaded DOD (MT-DOD). The evaluation was based on metrics including execution time, memory usage, and CPU cache misses. In multi-threaded tests, the DOD implementation demonstrated considerable performance gains, with faster execution times and a lower number of raw system calls and cache misses. While OOD occasionally showed marginal advantages in memory usage or percentage-based cache miss rates, DOD's efficiency in data-intensive operations was more evident. Furthermore, our findings reveal that for a fine-grained task like the A* algorithm, the overhead associated with thread management led to single-threaded versions significantly outperforming their multi-threaded counterparts in both paradigms. We conclude that even when performance differences appear subtle in simple algorithms, the consistent advantages of DOD in critical metrics highlight its foundational architectural superiority, suggesting it is a more effective approach for maximizing hardware efficiency in complex, large-scale AI and parallel computing tasks.

Abstract: Enterprise data management is a monumental task. It spans data architecture and systems, integration, quality, governance, and continuous improvement. While AI assistants can help specific persona, such as data engineers and stewards, to navigate and configure the data stack, they fall far short of full automation. However, as AI becomes increasingly capable of tackling tasks that have previously resisted automation due to inherent complexities, we believe there is an imminent opportunity to target fully autonomous data estates. Currently, AI is used in different parts of the data stack, but in this paper, we argue for a paradigm shift from the use of AI in independent data component operations towards a more holistic and autonomous handling of the entire data lifecycle. Towards that end, we explore how each stage of the modern data stack can be autonomously managed by intelligent agents to build self-sufficient systems that can be used not only by human end-users, but also by AI itself. We begin by describing the mounting forces and opportunities that demand this paradigm shift, examine how agents can streamline the data lifecycle, and highlight open questions and areas where additional research is needed. We hope this work will inspire lively debate, stimulate further research, motivate collaborative approaches, and facilitate a more autonomous future for data systems.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) often cost significant key-value (KV) cache overhead, due to their linear growth with the verbose chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning process. This costs both memory and throughput bottleneck limiting their efficient deployment. Towards reducing KV cache size during inference, we first investigate the effectiveness of existing KV cache eviction methods for CoT reasoning. Interestingly, we find that due to unstable token-wise scoring and the reduced effective KV budget caused by padding tokens, state-of-the-art (SoTA) eviction methods fail to maintain accuracy in the multi-batch setting. Additionally, these methods often generate longer sequences than the original model, as semantic-unaware token-wise eviction leads to repeated revalidation during reasoning. To address these issues, we present \textbf{SkipKV}, a \textbf{\textit{training-free}} KV compression method for selective \textit{eviction} and \textit{generation} operating at a coarse-grained sentence-level sequence removal for efficient CoT reasoning. In specific, it introduces a \textit{sentence-scoring metric} to identify and remove highly similar sentences while maintaining semantic coherence. To suppress redundant generation, SkipKV dynamically adjusts a steering vector to update the hidden activation states during inference enforcing the LRM to generate concise response. Extensive evaluations on multiple reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of SkipKV in maintaining up to $\mathbf{26.7}\%$ improved accuracy compared to the alternatives, at a similar compression budget. Additionally, compared to SoTA, SkipKV yields up to $\mathbf{1.6}\times$ fewer generation length while improving throughput up to $\mathbf{1.7}\times$.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a powerful tool for modeling and analyzing data with graph structures. The wide adoption in numerous applications underscores the value of these models. However, the complexity of these methods often impedes understanding their decision-making processes. Current Explainable AI (XAI) methods struggle to untangle the intricate relationships and interactions within graphs. Several methods have tried to bridge this gap via a post-hoc approach or self-interpretable design. Most of them focus on graph structure analysis to determine essential patterns that correlate with prediction outcomes. While post-hoc explanation methods are adaptable, they require extra computational resources and may be less reliable due to limited access to the model's internal workings. Conversely, Interpretable models can provide immediate explanations, but their generalizability to different scenarios remains a major concern. To address these shortcomings, this thesis seeks to develop a novel XAI framework tailored for graph-based machine learning. The proposed framework aims to offer adaptable, computationally efficient explanations for GNNs, moving beyond individual feature analysis to capture how graph structure influences predictions.

Abstract: The rising global prevalence of diabetes necessitates early detection to prevent severe complications. While AI-powered prediction applications offer a promising solution, they require a responsive and scalable back-end architecture to serve a large user base effectively. This paper details the development and evaluation of a scalable back-end system designed for a mobile diabetes prediction application. The primary objective was to maintain a failure rate below 5% and an average latency of under 1000 ms. The architecture leverages horizontal scaling, database sharding, and asynchronous communication via a message queue. Performance evaluation showed that 83% of the system's features (20 out of 24) met the specified performance targets. Key functionalities such as user profile management, activity tracking, and read-intensive prediction operations successfully achieved the desired performance. The system demonstrated the ability to handle up to 10,000 concurrent users without issues, validating its scalability. The implementation of asynchronous communication using RabbitMQ proved crucial in minimizing the error rate for computationally intensive prediction requests, ensuring system reliability by queuing requests and preventing data loss under heavy load.

Abstract: Learning about the causal structure of the world is a fundamental problem for human cognition. Causal models and especially causal learning have proved to be difficult for large pretrained models using standard techniques of deep learning. In contrast, cognitive scientists have applied advances in our formal understanding of causation in computer science, particularly within the Causal Bayes Net formalism, to understand human causal learning. In the very different tradition of reinforcement learning, researchers have described an intrinsic reward signal called "empowerment" which maximizes mutual information between actions and their outcomes. "Empowerment" may be an important bridge between classical Bayesian causal learning and reinforcement learning and may help to characterize causal learning in humans and enable it in machines. If an agent learns an accurate causal world model, they will necessarily increase their empowerment, and increasing empowerment will lead to a more accurate causal world model. Empowerment may also explain distinctive features of childrens causal learning, as well as providing a more tractable computational account of how that learning is possible. In an empirical study, we systematically test how children and adults use cues to empowerment to infer causal relations, and design effective causal interventions.

Conclusion: KPI框架通过融合医疗知识图谱、原型学习和可解释性增强，有效解决了基于患者信息进行疾病预测中的数据不平衡和可解释性不足问题，为可靠、以患者为中心的医疗决策提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Predicting diseases solely from patient-side information, such as demographics and self-reported symptoms, has attracted significant research attention due to its potential to enhance patient awareness, facilitate early healthcare engagement, and improve healthcare system efficiency. However, existing approaches encounter critical challenges, including imbalanced disease distributions and a lack of interpretability, resulting in biased or unreliable predictions. To address these issues, we propose the Knowledge graph-enhanced, Prototype-aware, and Interpretable (KPI) framework. KPI systematically integrates structured and trusted medical knowledge into a unified disease knowledge graph, constructs clinically meaningful disease prototypes, and employs contrastive learning to enhance predictive accuracy, which is particularly important for long-tailed diseases. Additionally, KPI utilizes large language models (LLMs) to generate patient-specific, medically relevant explanations, thereby improving interpretability and reliability. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that KPI outperforms state-of-the-art methods in predictive accuracy and provides clinically valid explanations that closely align with patient narratives, highlighting its practical value for patient-centered healthcare delivery.

Abstract: Previous research has reported that large language models (LLMs) demonstrate poor performance on the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) exams. However, recent reasoning models have achieved strong results on graduate-level academic and professional examinations across various disciplines. In this paper, we evaluate state-of-the-art reasoning models on a set of mock CFA exams consisting of 980 questions across three Level I exams, two Level II exams, and three Level III exams. Using the same pass/fail criteria from prior studies, we find that most models clear all three levels. The models that pass, ordered by overall performance, are Gemini 3.0 Pro, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5, Grok 4, Claude Opus 4.1, and DeepSeek-V3.1. Specifically, Gemini 3.0 Pro achieves a record score of 97.6% on Level I. Performance is also strong on Level II, led by GPT-5 at 94.3%. On Level III, Gemini 2.5 Pro attains the highest score with 86.4% on multiple-choice questions while Gemini 3.0 Pro achieves 92.0% on constructed-response questions.

Abstract: Modern businesses are increasingly challenged by the time and expense required to generate and assess high-quality content. Human writers face time constraints, and extrinsic evaluations can be costly. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential in content creation, concerns about the quality of AI-generated content persist. Traditional evaluation methods, like human surveys, further add operational costs, highlighting the need for efficient, automated solutions. This research introduces Generative Agents as a means to tackle these challenges. These agents can rapidly and cost-effectively evaluate AI-generated content, simulating human judgment by rating aspects such as coherence, interestingness, clarity, fairness, and relevance. By incorporating these agents, businesses can streamline content generation and ensure consistent, high-quality output while minimizing reliance on costly human evaluations. The study provides critical insights into enhancing LLMs for producing business-aligned, high-quality content, offering significant advancements in automated content generation and evaluation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种强化策略注入机制(rSIM)，通过小型规划器引导LLM的思维链，将任意LLM转变为推理语言模型(RLM)。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通过强化学习后训练演变为推理语言模型，其高级推理的显著特征是生成思维链时的'顿悟'时刻。受此启发，作者希望开发一种机制，使任何LLM都能通过自适应注入推理策略来获得这种能力。

Method: 提出rSIM机制，采用领导者-追随者框架的多智能体强化学习(MARL)，联合训练规划器（领导者智能体）和LLM（追随者智能体）。规划器引导LLM的思维链过程，通过基于规则的简单奖励进行训练。

Result: 实验结果显示，使用rSIM能使Qwen2.5-0.5B显著超越Qwen2.5-14B的性能。规划器具有通用性：仅需训练一次即可作为插件大幅提升现有LLM的推理能力，且支持跨任务持续学习。

Conclusion: rSIM是一种有效的机制，能够将任意LLM转变为具有高级推理能力的RLM，规划器的通用性和持续学习特性使其具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are post-trained through reinforcement learning (RL) to evolve into Reasoning Language Models (RLMs), where the hallmark of this advanced reasoning is ``aha'' moments when they start to perform strategies, such as self-reflection and deep thinking, within chain of thoughts (CoTs). Motivated by this, this paper proposes a novel reinforced strategy injection mechanism (rSIM), that enables any LLM to become an RLM by employing a small planner to guide the LLM's CoT through the adaptive injection of reasoning strategies. To achieve this, the planner (leader agent) is jointly trained with an LLM (follower agent) using multi-agent RL (MARL), based on a leader-follower framework and straightforward rule-based rewards. Experimental results show that rSIM enables Qwen2.5-0.5B to become an RLM and significantly outperform Qwen2.5-14B. Moreover, the planner is generalizable: it only needs to be trained once and can be applied as a plug-in to substantially improve the reasoning capabilities of existing LLMs. In addition, the planner supports continual learning across various tasks, allowing its planning abilities to gradually improve and generalize to a wider range of problems.

Conclusion: 研究表明智能、数据中心的模型可以有效替代传统方法，促进基础设施分析和设计的数字化转型。

Abstract: The California Bearing Ratio (CBR) is a key geotechnical indicator used to assess the load-bearing capacity of subgrade soils, especially in transportation infrastructure and foundation design. Traditional CBR determination relies on laboratory penetration tests. Despite their accuracy, these tests are often time-consuming, costly, and can be impractical, particularly for large-scale or diverse soil profiles. Recent progress in artificial intelligence, especially machine learning (ML), has enabled data-driven approaches for modeling complex soil behavior with greater speed and precision. This study introduces a comprehensive ML framework for CBR prediction using a dataset of 382 soil samples collected from various geoclimatic regions in Türkiye. The dataset includes physicochemical soil properties relevant to bearing capacity, allowing multidimensional feature representation in a supervised learning context. Twelve ML algorithms were tested, including decision tree, random forest, extra trees, gradient boosting, xgboost, k-nearest neighbors, support vector regression, multi-layer perceptron, adaboost, bagging, voting, and stacking regressors. Each model was trained, validated, and evaluated to assess its generalization and robustness. Among them, the random forest regressor performed the best, achieving strong R2 scores of 0.95 (training), 0.76 (validation), and 0.83 (test). These outcomes highlight the model's powerful nonlinear mapping ability, making it a promising tool for predictive geotechnical tasks. The study supports the integration of intelligent, data-centric models in geotechnical engineering, offering an effective alternative to traditional methods and promoting digital transformation in infrastructure analysis and design.

Abstract: Soil compaction is critical in construction engineering to ensure the stability of structures like road embankments and earth dams. Traditional methods for determining optimum moisture content (OMC) and maximum dry density (MDD) involve labor-intensive laboratory experiments, and empirical regression models have limited applicability and accuracy across diverse soil types. In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as alternatives for predicting these compaction parameters. However, ML models often struggle with prediction accuracy and generalizability, particularly with heterogeneous datasets representing various soil types. This study proposes an automated machine learning (AutoML) approach to predict OMC and MDD. AutoML automates algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization, potentially improving accuracy and scalability. Through extensive experimentation, the study found that the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm provided the best performance, achieving R-squared values of 80.4% for MDD and 89.1% for OMC on a separate dataset. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoML in predicting compaction parameters across different soil types. The study also highlights the importance of heterogeneous datasets in improving the generalization and performance of ML models. Ultimately, this research contributes to more efficient and reliable construction practices by enhancing the prediction of soil compaction parameters.

Abstract: Workplace toxicity is widely recognized as detrimental to organizational culture, yet quantifying its direct impact on operational efficiency remains methodologically challenging due to the ethical and practical difficulties of reproducing conflict in human subjects. This study leverages Large Language Model (LLM) based Multi-Agent Systems to simulate 1-on-1 adversarial debates, creating a controlled "sociological sandbox". We employ a Monte Carlo method to simulate hundrets of discussions, measuring the convergence time (defined as the number of arguments required to reach a conclusion) between a baseline control group and treatment groups involving agents with "toxic" system prompts. Our results demonstrate a statistically significant increase of approximately 25\% in the duration of conversations involving toxic participants. We propose that this "latency of toxicity" serves as a proxy for financial damage in corporate and academic settings. Furthermore, we demonstrate that agent-based modeling provides a reproducible, ethical alternative to human-subject research for measuring the mechanics of social friction.

Abstract: Biosignals collected from wearable devices are widely utilized in healthcare applications. Machine learning models used in these applications often rely on features extracted from biosignals due to their effectiveness, lower data dimensionality, and wide compatibility across various model architectures. However, existing feature extraction methods often lack task-specific contextual knowledge, struggle to identify optimal feature extraction settings in high-dimensional feature space, and are prone to code generation and automation errors. In this paper, we propose DeepFeature, the first LLM-empowered, context-aware feature generation framework for wearable biosignals. DeepFeature introduces a multi-source feature generation mechanism that integrates expert knowledge with task settings. It also employs an iterative feature refinement process that uses feature assessment-based feedback for feature re-selection. Additionally, DeepFeature utilizes a robust multi-layer filtering and verification approach for robust feature-to-code translation to ensure that the extraction functions run without crashing. Experimental evaluation results show that DeepFeature achieves an average AUROC improvement of 4.21-9.67% across eight diverse tasks compared to baseline methods. It outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on five tasks while maintaining comparable performance on the remaining tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models have revolutionized function-level code generation; however, repository-scale Automated Program Repair (APR) remains a significant challenge. Current approaches typically employ a control-centric paradigm, forcing agents to navigate complex directory structures and irrelevant control logic. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift from the standard Code Property Graphs (CPGs) to the concept of Data Transformation Graph (DTG) that inverts the topology by modeling data states as nodes and functions as edges, enabling agents to trace logic defects through data lineage rather than control flow. We introduce a multi-agent framework that reconciles data integrity navigation with control flow logic. Our theoretical analysis and case studies demonstrate that this approach resolves the "Semantic Trap" inherent in standard RAG systems in modern coding agents. We provide a comprehensive implementation in the form of Autonomous Issue Resolver (AIR), a self-improvement system for zero-touch code maintenance that utilizes neuro-symbolic reasoning and uses the DTG structure for scalable logic repair. Our approach has demonstrated good results on several SWE benchmarks, reaching a resolution rate of 87.1% on SWE-Verified benchmark. Our approach directly addresses the core limitations of current AI code-assistant tools and tackles the critical need for a more robust foundation for our increasingly software-dependent world.

Abstract: Ethical awareness is critical for robots operating in human environments, yet existing automated planning tools provide little support. Manually specifying ethical rules is labour-intensive and highly context-specific. We present Principles2Plan, an interactive research prototype demonstrating how a human and a Large Language Model (LLM) can collaborate to produce context-sensitive ethical rules and guide automated planning. A domain expert provides the planning domain, problem details, and relevant high-level principles such as beneficence and privacy. The system generates operationalisable ethical rules consistent with these principles, which the user can review, prioritise, and supply to a planner to produce ethically-informed plans. To our knowledge, no prior system supports users in generating principle-grounded rules for classical planning contexts. Principles2Plan showcases the potential of human-LLM collaboration for making ethical automated planning more practical and feasible.

Abstract: Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) is an effective1 framework for solving complex optimization prob-2 lems. The development of large language mod-3 els (LLMs) enables the automated generation of4 heuristics. Existing LLM-based evolutionary meth-5 ods rely on population strategies and are prone6 to local optima. Integrating LLMs with Monte7 Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) improves the trade-off8 between exploration and exploitation, but multi-9 round cognitive integration remains limited and10 search diversity is constrained. To overcome these11 limitations, this paper proposes a novel cognitive-12 guided MCTS framework (CogMCTS). CogMCTS13 tightly integrates the cognitive guidance mecha-14 nism of LLMs with MCTS to achieve efficient au-15 tomated heuristic optimization. The framework16 employs multi-round cognitive feedback to incor-17 porate historical experience, node information, and18 negative outcomes, dynamically improving heuris-19 tic generation.

In addition, strate-23 gic mutation modifies the heuristic forms and pa-24 rameters to further enhance the diversity of the so-25 lution and the overall optimization performance.26 The experimental results indicate that CogMCTS27 outperforms existing LLM-based AHD methods in28 stability, efficiency, and solution quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have enabled their use as intelligent agents for smartphone operation. However, existing methods depend on the Android Debug Bridge (ADB) for data transmission and action execution, limiting their applicability to Android devices. In this work, we introduce the novel Embodied Smartphone Operation (ESO) task and present See-Control, a framework that enables smartphone operation via direct physical interaction with a low-DoF robotic arm, offering a platform-agnostic solution. See-Control comprises three key components: (1) an ESO benchmark with 155 tasks and corresponding evaluation metrics; (2) an MLLM-based embodied agent that generates robotic control commands without requiring ADB or system back-end access; and (3) a richly annotated dataset of operation episodes, offering valuable resources for future research. By bridging the gap between digital agents and the physical world, See-Control provides a concrete step toward enabling home robots to perform smartphone-dependent tasks in realistic environments.

Abstract: Multimodal clinical reasoning in the field of gastrointestinal (GI) oncology necessitates the integrated interpretation of endoscopic imagery, radiological data, and biochemical markers. Despite the evident potential exhibited by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), they frequently encounter challenges such as context dilution and hallucination when confronted with intricate, heterogeneous medical histories. In order to address these limitations, a hierarchical Multi-Agent Framework is proposed, which emulates the collaborative workflow of a human Multidisciplinary Team (MDT). The system attained a composite expert evaluation score of 4.60/5.00, thereby demonstrating a substantial improvement over the monolithic baseline. It is noteworthy that the agent-based architecture yielded the most substantial enhancements in reasoning logic and medical accuracy. The findings indicate that mimetic, agent-based collaboration provides a scalable, interpretable, and clinically robust paradigm for automated decision support in oncology.

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are increasingly assuming the role of the "brain" of AI agents. While recent efforts have begun to equip FMs with native single-agent abilities -- such as GUI interaction or integrated tool use -- we argue that the next frontier is endowing FMs with native multi-agent intelligence. We identify four core capabilities of FMs in multi-agent contexts: understanding, planning, efficient communication, and adaptation. Contrary to assumptions about the spontaneous emergence of such abilities, we provide extensive empirical evidence across 41 large language models showing that strong single-agent performance alone does not automatically yield robust multi-agent intelligence. To address this gap, we outline key research directions -- spanning dataset construction, evaluation, training paradigms, and safety considerations -- for building FMs with native multi-agent intelligence.

Abstract: Agentic AI marks a major shift in how autonomous systems reason, plan, and execute multi-step tasks. Unlike traditional single model prompting, agentic workflows integrate multiple specialized agents with different Large Language Models(LLMs), tool-augmented capabilities, orchestration logic, and external system interactions to form dynamic pipelines capable of autonomous decision-making and action. As adoption accelerates across industry and research, organizations face a central challenge: how to design, engineer, and operate production-grade agentic AI workflows that are reliable, observable, maintainable, and aligned with safety and governance requirements. This paper provides a practical, end-to-end guide for designing, developing, and deploying production-quality agentic AI systems. We introduce a structured engineering lifecycle encompassing workflow decomposition, multi-agent design patterns, Model Context Protocol(MCP), and tool integration, deterministic orchestration, Responsible-AI considerations, and environment-aware deployment strategies. We then present nine core best practices for engineering production-grade agentic AI workflows, including tool-first design over MCP, pure-function invocation, single-tool and single-responsibility agents, externalized prompt management, Responsible-AI-aligned model-consortium design, clean separation between workflow logic and MCP servers, containerized deployment for scalable operations, and adherence to the Keep it Simple, Stupid (KISS) principle to maintain simplicity and robustness. To demonstrate these principles in practice, we present a comprehensive case study: a multimodal news-analysis and media-generation workflow. By combining architectural guidance, operational patterns, and practical implementation insights, this paper offers a foundational reference to build robust, extensible, and production-ready agentic AI workflows.

Result: 开发出高效的检索框架，能语义匹配文本查询到相关LoRA，同时过滤过强或不稳定的组件，在自动和人工评估中优于文本基线方法。

Conclusion: CARLoS不仅支持LoRA的有效检索，其表示还可用于分析强度、一致性与版权法律概念（实质性、意志）的关联，成为具有广泛相关性的实用系统。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of generative components, such as LoRAs, has created a vast but unstructured ecosystem. Existing discovery methods depend on unreliable user descriptions or biased popularity metrics, hindering usability. We present CARLoS, a large-scale framework for characterizing LoRAs without requiring additional metadata. Analyzing over 650 LoRAs, we employ them in image generation over a variety of prompts and seeds, as a credible way to assess their behavior. Using CLIP embeddings and their difference to a base-model generation, we concisely define a three-part representation: Directions, defining semantic shift; Strength, quantifying the significance of the effect; and Consistency, quantifying how stable the effect is. Using these representations, we develop an efficient retrieval framework that semantically matches textual queries to relevant LoRAs while filtering overly strong or unstable ones, outperforming textual baselines in automated and human evaluations. While retrieval is our primary focus, the same representation also supports analyses linking Strength and Consistency to legal notions of substantiality and volition, key considerations in copyright, positioning CARLoS as a practical system with broader relevance for LoRA analysis.

Motivation: Craig插值和均匀插值在知识表示中有很多应用，包括可解释性、遗忘、模块化、重用甚至学习，但许多知识表示形式化方法缺乏这些插值特性，且实际计算插值很困难。

Method: 深入研究了两种重要的知识表示形式化方法：描述逻辑和逻辑编程，讨论了计算插值的理论结果和实用方法。

Result: 分析表明，虽然描述逻辑和逻辑编程等知识表示形式化方法在实际应用中很重要，但它们通常缺乏插值特性，且实际计算插值具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 理解描述逻辑和逻辑编程中插值的理论和计算方法对于知识表示的应用至关重要，但需要进一步研究来解决现有形式化方法中插值特性的不足和计算难度。

Abstract: Craig interpolation and uniform interpolation have many applications in knowledge representation, including explainability, forgetting, modularization and reuse, and even learning. At the same time, many relevant knowledge representation formalisms do in general not have Craig or uniform interpolation, and computing interpolants in practice is challenging. We have a closer look at two prominent knowledge representation formalisms, description logics and logic programming, and discuss theoretical results and practical methods for computing interpolants.

Abstract: Foundation agents have rapidly advanced in their ability to reason and interact with real environments, making the evaluation of their core capabilities increasingly important. While many benchmarks have been developed to assess agent performance, most concentrate on academic settings or artificially designed scenarios while overlooking the challenges that arise in real applications. To address this issue, we focus on a highly practical real-world setting, the e-commerce domain, which involves a large volume of diverse user interactions, dynamic market conditions, and tasks directly tied to real decision-making processes. To this end, we introduce EcomBench, a holistic E-commerce Benchmark designed to evaluate agent performance in realistic e-commerce environments. EcomBench is built from genuine user demands embedded in leading global e-commerce ecosystems and is carefully curated and annotated through human experts to ensure clarity, accuracy, and domain relevance. It covers multiple task categories within e-commerce scenarios and defines three difficulty levels that evaluate agents on key capabilities such as deep information retrieval, multi-step reasoning, and cross-source knowledge integration. By grounding evaluation in real e-commerce contexts, EcomBench provides a rigorous and dynamic testbed for measuring the practical capabilities of agents in modern e-commerce.

TL;DR: REST和REST+基准测试用于系统性评估多模态大语言模型的跨模态不一致性问题，发现即使OCR正确，现有模型也无法在不同模态间保持一致推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型被训练在相同嵌入空间中表示视觉和语言，但无法在不同模态间执行相同任务，需要系统评估这种跨模态不一致性。

Method: 创建包含相同语义信息的图像、文本和混合三种模态样本的REST和REST+基准，评估15个MLLMs在不同模态间推理的一致性。

Result: 最先进的MLLMs无法在不同模态间保持一致性推理，模型性能受视觉特征（文本颜色、分辨率）和视觉令牌数量影响，而不受字体影响。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型存在显著的跨模态不一致问题，一致性得分与文本和图像间的模态差距相关，揭示了模型机制上的局限性。

Abstract: We introduce two new benchmarks REST and REST+(Render-Equivalence Stress Tests) to enable systematic evaluation of cross-modal inconsistency in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). MLLMs are trained to represent vision and language in the same embedding space, yet they cannot perform the same tasks in both modalities. Our benchmarks contain samples with the same semantic information in three modalities (image, text, mixed) and we show that state-of-the-art MLLMs cannot consistently reason over these different modalities. We evaluate 15 MLLMs and find that the degree of modality inconsistency varies substantially, even when accounting for problems with text recognition (OCR). Neither rendering text as image nor rendering an image as text solves the inconsistency. Even if OCR is correct, we find that visual characteristics (text colour and resolution, but not font) and the number of vision tokens have an impact on model performance. Finally, we find that our consistency score correlates with the modality gap between text and images, highlighting a mechanistic interpretation of cross-modal inconsistent MLLMs.
