Proposal selection depends on assessing the relative strength among submitted proposals; however, traditional human scoring often suffers from weak inter-proposal correlations and is subject to reviewer bias and inconsistency. A pairwise preference-based approach is logically superior, providing a more rigorous and internally consistent basis for ranking, but its quadratic workload makes it impractical for human reviewers. We address this limitation using LLMs. Leveraging the uniquely well-curated proposals and publication records from three beamlines at the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL), we show that the LLM rankings correlate strongly with the human rankings (Spearman $\u03c1\\simeq 0.2-0.8$, improving to $\\geq 0.5$ after 10\\% outlier removal). Moreover, LLM performance is no worse than that of human reviewers in identifying proposals with high publication potential, while costing over two orders of magnitude less. Beyond ranking, LLMs enable advanced analyses that are challenging for humans, such as quantitative assessment of proposal similarity via embedding models, which provides information crucial for review committees.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u6539\u8fdb\u5927\u578b\u7528\u6237\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u63d0\u6848\u8bc4\u9009\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u5ba1\uff0cLLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002\u63d0\u6848\u9009\u62e9\u5173\u952e\u5728\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u6848\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u5206\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5f31\u3001\u6613\u53d7\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u5bf9\u504f\u597d\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u66f4\u4e25\u8c28\u3001\u5185\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u5ba1\u6765\u8bf4\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u5de8\u5927\u3002\u5229\u7528\u6a61\u6811\u5cad\u56fd\u5bb6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u6563\u88c2\u4e2d\u5b50\u6e90\u4e09\u4e2a\u675f\u7ebf\u7684\u7cbe\u5fc3\u6574\u7406\u63d0\u6848\u548c\u53d1\u8868\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660eLLM\u6392\u540d\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6392\u540d\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\uff08\u76f8\u5173\u7cfb\u65700.2-0.8\uff0c\u79fb\u966410%\u79bb\u7fa4\u503c\u540e\u53ef\u8fbe\u22650.5\uff09\u3002LLM\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u9ad8\u53d1\u8868\u6f5c\u529b\u63d0\u6848\u65b9\u9762\u4e0d\u900a\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u5ba1\uff0c\u800c\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0cLLM\u8fd8\u80fd\u8fdb\u884c\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u91cf\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u6848\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7b49\u4eba\u7c7b\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u5148\u8fdb\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u5ba1\u63d0\u6848\u8bc4\u5206\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u5927\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1\uff09\u4e0d\u540c\u63d0\u6848\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8f83\u5f31\uff1b2\uff09\u6613\u53d7\u8bc4\u5ba1\u4eba\u504f\u89c1\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b3\uff09\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u867d\u7136\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u5bf9\u504f\u597d\u7684\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u66f4\u4e25\u8c28\u3001\u5185\u90e8\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u66f4\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u6309\u63d0\u6848\u6570\u91cf\u5448\u4e8c\u6b21\u65b9\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5bf9\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u5ba1\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u73b0\u5b9e\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5bfb\u627e\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u63d0\u6848\u8bc4\u5ba1\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5f3a\u8c03\u57fa\u4e8e\u6210\u5bf9\u504f\u597d\u7684\u6392\u540d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u903b\u8f91\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7LLM\u81ea\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u6210\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u6570\u636e\u6765\u81ea\u6a61\u6811\u5cad\u56fd\u5bb6\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u6563\u88c2\u4e2d\u5b50\u6e90\u4e09\u4e2a\u675f\u7ebf\u7684\u7cbe\u5fc3\u6574\u7406\u63d0\u6848\u548c\u76f8\u5e94\u53d1\u8868\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u9664\u4e86\u57fa\u672c\u6392\u540d\u529f\u80fd\u5916\uff0c\u8fd8\u5229\u7528\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u63d0\u6848\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u5206\u6790\u7b49\u9ad8\u7ea7\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "1.

This suggests a dual interpretation: in the physics view, the process function acts as the environment into which local operations (agent interventions) are inserted, whereas in the AI view it encodes the agent and the inserted functions represent environments.

However, their strong performance relies on large training datasets, which are costly or risky to obtain, especially when adapting to new domains. Transfer learning is the natural way to adapt pretrained discrete diffusion models, but current methods require fine-tuning large diffusion models, which is computationally expensive and often impractical. Building on ratio-based transfer learning for continuous diffusion, we provide Guided Transfer Learning for discrete diffusion models (GTL). This enables sampling from a target distribution without modifying the pretrained denoiser. The same guidance formulation applies to both discrete-time diffusion and continuous-time score-based discrete diffusion, yielding a unified treatment. Guided discrete diffusion often requires many forward passes of the guidance network, which becomes impractical for large vocabularies and long sequences. To address this, we further present an efficient guided sampler that concentrates evaluations on planner-selected positions and top candidate tokens, thus lowering sampling time and computation. This makes guided language modeling practical at scale for large vocabularies and long sequences. We evaluate GTL on sequential data, including synthetic Markov chains and language modeling, and provide empirical analyses of its behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While loop temperatures are measured, loop-level mass flows and receiver heat-loss parameters are unobserved, making it impossible to diagnose hydraulic imbalances or receiver degradation using standard monitoring tools.\n  We present a physics-informed learning framework that infers (i) loop-level mass-flow ratios and (ii) time-varying receiver heat-transfer coefficients directly from routine operational data. The method exploits nocturnal homogenization periods -- when hot oil is circulated through a non-irradiated field -- to isolate hydraulic and thermal-loss effects.

However, with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), full retraining to recover pruning-induced performance degradation is often prohibitive and classical approaches such as global magnitude pruning are suboptimal on Transformer architectures. State-of-the-art methods hence solve a layer-wise mask selection problem, the problem of finding a pruning mask which minimizes the per-layer pruning error on a small set of calibration data. Exactly solving this problem to optimality using Integer Programming (IP) solvers is computationally infeasible due to its combinatorial nature and the size of the search space, and existing approaches therefore rely on approximations or heuristics. In this work, we demonstrate that the mask selection problem can be made drastically more tractable at LLM scale. To that end, we decouple the rows by enforcing equal sparsity levels per row. This allows us to derive optimal 1-swaps (exchanging one kept and one pruned weight) that can be computed efficiently using the Gram matrix of the calibration data. Using these observations, we propose a tractable and simple 1-swap algorithm that warm starts from any pruning mask, runs efficiently on GPUs at LLM scale, and is essentially hyperparameter-free. We demonstrate that our approach reduces per-layer pruning error by up to 60% over Wanda (Sun et al., 2023) and consistently improves perplexity and zero-shot accuracy across state-of-the-art GPT architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The learned policy is compared against a reference deterministic kinematic planner, the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA), commonly employed as a robust baseline for obstacle avoidance. The evaluation is conducted in a realistic simulation environment and complemented by validation on a physical BlueROV2 supervised by a 3D digital twin of the test site, helping to reduce risks associated with real-world experimentation. The results show that the PPO policy consistently outperforms DWA in highly cluttered environments, notably thanks to better local adaptation and reduced collisions.

Recent work has proposed to use chunked critics, which estimate the value of short action sequences (\"chunks\") rather than individual actions, speeding up value backup. However, extracting policies from chunked critics is challenging: policies must output the entire action chunk open-loop, which can be sub-optimal for environments that require policy reactivity and also challenging to model especially when the chunk length grows. Our key insight is to decouple the chunk length of the critic from that of the policy, allowing the policy to operate over shorter action chunks. We propose a novel algorithm that achieves this by optimizing the policy against a distilled critic for partial action chunks, constructed by optimistically backing up from the original chunked critic to approximate the maximum value achievable when a partial action chunk is extended to a complete one. This design retains the benefits of multi-step value propagation while sidestepping both the open-loop sub-optimality and the difficulty of learning action chunking policies for long action chunks.

In many real-world scenarios, such as acquiring data from public repositories or sharing across institutions, data is naturally organized into discrete datasets that vary in relevance, quality, and utility. Selecting which repositories or institutions to search for useful datasets, and which datasets to incorporate into model training are therefore critical decisions, yet most existing methods select individual samples and treat all data as equally relevant, ignoring differences between datasets and their sources. In this work, we formalize the task of dataset selection: selecting entire datasets from a large, heterogeneous pool to improve downstream performance under resource constraints. We propose Dataset Selection via Hierarchies (DaSH), a dataset selection method that models utility at both dataset and group (e.g., collections, institutions) levels, enabling efficient generalization from limited observations. Across two public benchmarks (Digit-Five and DomainNet), DaSH outperforms state-of-the-art data selection baselines by up to 26.2% in accuracy, while requiring significantly fewer exploration steps.

Standard NFs consist of a forward process and a reverse process: the forward process maps data to noise, while the reverse process generates samples by inverting it. Typical NF forward transformations are constrained by explicit invertibility, ensuring that the reverse process can serve as their exact analytic inverse. Recent developments in TARFlow and its variants have revitalized NF methods by combining Transformers and autoregressive flows, but have also exposed causal decoding as a major bottleneck. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Normalizing Flow ($\\textbf{BiFlow}$), a framework that removes the need for an exact analytic inverse. BiFlow learns a reverse model that approximates the underlying noise-to-data inverse mapping, enabling more flexible loss functions and architectures. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that BiFlow, compared to its causal decoding counterpart, improves generation quality while accelerating sampling by up to two orders of magnitude. BiFlow yields state-of-the-art results among NF-based methods and competitive performance among single-evaluation (\"1-NFE\") methods.

Each item is carefully designed and reviewed by 3DV experts with explanatory rationales to ensure precise, unambiguous grounding. Leveraging its diverse data sources and holistic task coverage, MMSI-Video-Bench also supports three domain-oriented sub-benchmarks (Indoor Scene Perception Bench, Robot Bench and Grounding Bench) for targeted capability assessment. We evaluate 25 strong open-source and proprietary MLLMs, revealing a striking human--AI gap: many models perform near chance, and the best reasoning model lags humans by nearly 60%. We further find that spatially fine-tuned models still fail to generalize effectively on our benchmark. Fine-grained error analysis exposes systematic failures in geometric reasoning, motion grounding, long-horizon prediction, and cross-video correspondence. We also show that typical frame-sampling strategies transfer poorly to our reasoning-intensive benchmark, and that neither 3D spatial cues nor chain-of-thought prompting yields meaningful gains.

One of the key innovations that allows for such a flexible framework is a modular representation of a 4D scene; specifically, per-view 4D predictions are encoded using a variety of egocentric factors (depthmaps and camera intrinsics) represented in local camera coordinates, and allocentric factors (camera extrinsics and scene flow) represented in global world coordinates.

Existing multimodal models exploring the potential of reasoning with images are brittle and do not scale. They rely on calling specialist tools, costly generation of images, or handcrafted reasoning data to switch between text and image thoughts. Instead, we offer a simpler alternative -- Mull-Tokens -- modality-agnostic latent tokens pre-trained to hold intermediate information in either image or text modalities to let the model think free-form towards the correct answer. We investigate best practices to train Mull-Tokens inspired by latent reasoning frameworks. We first train Mull-Tokens using supervision from interleaved text-image traces, and then fine-tune without any supervision by only using the final answers. Across four challenging spatial reasoning benchmarks involving tasks such as solving puzzles and taking different perspectives, we demonstrate that Mull-Tokens improve upon several baselines utilizing text-only reasoning or interleaved image-text reasoning, achieving a +3% average improvement and up to +16% on a puzzle solving reasoning-heavy split compared to our strongest baseline.

However, existing methods lack fine-grained temporal control over subject appearance and disappearance, which are essential for applications such as compositional video synthesis, storyboarding, and controllable animation. We propose AlcheMinT, a unified framework that introduces explicit timestamps conditioning for subject-driven video generation. Our approach introduces a novel positional encoding mechanism that unlocks the encoding of temporal intervals, associated in our case with subject identities, while seamlessly integrating with the pretrained video generation model positional embeddings. Additionally, we incorporate subject-descriptive text tokens to strengthen binding between visual identity and video captions, mitigating ambiguity during generation. Through token-wise concatenation, AlcheMinT avoids any additional cross-attention modules and incurs negligible parameter overhead. We establish a benchmark evaluating multiple subject identity preservation, video fidelity, and temporal adherence. Experimental results demonstrate that AlcheMinT achieves visual quality matching state-of-the-art video personalization methods, while, for the first time, enabling precise temporal control over multi-subject generation within videos.

However, applying RL to 3D generation remains largely unexplored due to the higher spatial complexity of 3D objects, which require globally consistent geometry and fine-grained local textures. This makes 3D generation significantly sensitive to reward designs and RL algorithms. To address these challenges, we conduct the first systematic study of RL for text-to-3D autoregressive generation across several dimensions. (1) Reward designs: We evaluate reward dimensions and model choices, showing that alignment with human preference is crucial, and that general multi-modal models provide robust signal for 3D attributes. (2) RL algorithms: We study GRPO variants, highlighting the effectiveness of token-level optimization, and further investigate the scaling of training data and iterations. (3) Text-to-3D Benchmarks: Since existing benchmarks fail to measure implicit reasoning abilities in 3D generation models, we introduce MME-3DR. (4) Advanced RL paradigms: Motivated by the natural hierarchy of 3D generation, we propose Hi-GRPO, which optimizes the global-to-local hierarchical 3D generation through dedicated reward ensembles. Based on these insights, we develop AR3D-R1, the first RL-enhanced text-to-3D model, expert from coarse shape to texture refinement.

Besides, we construct an open-set 3D scene dataset to further extend the generalization of the pose estimation model.
