Conventional static resource allocation often leads to overprovisioning or underprovisioning due to the dynamic nature of traffic loads and application demands. To address this challenge, we propose a hybrid forecast-driven Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that combines predictive intelligence with SFC provisioning. Specifically, we leverage DRL to generate datasets capturing DC resource utilization and service demands, which are then used to train deep learning forecasting models. Using Optuna-based hyperparameter optimization, the best-performing models, Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network, Temporal Graph Neural Network, and Long Short-Term Memory, are combined into an ensemble to enhance stability and accuracy. The ensemble predictions are integrated into the DC selection process, enabling proactive placement decisions that consider both current and future resource availability. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only sustains high acceptance ratios for resource-intensive services such as Cloud Gaming and VoIP but also significantly improves acceptance ratios for latency-critical categories such as Augmented Reality increases from 30% to 50%, while Industry 4.0 improves from 30% to 45%. Consequently, the prediction-based model achieves significantly lower E2E latencies of 20.5%, 23.8%, and 34.8% reductions for VoIP, Video Streaming, and Cloud Gaming, respectively. This strategy ensures more balanced resource allocation, and reduces contention.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The system formulates the rendered-pixel ratio as a continuous control variable and jointly optimizes it over the Open Cloud (O-Cloud) compute, gNB transmit power, and bandwidth under a Weber-Fechner quality of experience (QoE) model, explicitly balancing resolution, computation, and latency. A Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) agent with structured action decomposition and QoE-aware reward shaping resolves the resulting high-dimensional control problem.

Unlike classical formulations, we consider a covert adversary who has knowledge of the detector's false alarm constraint parameter $\u03b3$ and selects a stationary post-change distribution that depends on it, seeking to remain undetected for as long as possible. Building on the theoretical foundations of the CuSum procedure, we rigorously characterize the asymptotic behavior of the average detection delay (ADD) and the average time to false alarm (AT2FA) when the post-change distribution converges to the pre-change distribution as $\u03b3\\to \\infty$. Our analysis establishes exact asymptotic expressions for these quantities, extending and refining classical results that no longer hold in this regime. We identify the critical scaling laws governing covert behavior and derive explicit conditions under which an adversary can maintain covertness, defined by ADD = $\u0398(\u03b3)$, whereas in the classical setting, ADD grows only as $\\mathcal{O}(\\log \u03b3)$. In particular, for Gaussian and Exponential models under adversarial perturbations of their respective parameters, we asymptotically characterize ADD as a function of the Kullback--Leibler divergence between the pre- and post-change distributions and $\u03b3$.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The results quantify the impacts of intelligence mode design, model size, task complexity, and orchestrator-specialist coordination, and provide key lessons for building future agentic AI systems in real-world building energy applications.

Orthogonal Plane-Wave Transmit-Receive Isotropic-Focusing Micro-Ultrasound (OPTIMUS) is a novel imaging scheme that can use TOBE arrays to achieve nearly isotropic focusing throughout an expansive volume. This approach extends upon a similar volumetric imaging scheme, Hadamard Encoded Row Column Ultrasonic Expansive Scanning (HERCULES), that is even able to image beyond the shadow of the aperture, much like typical 2D matrix probes. We simulate a grid of scatterers to evaluate how the resolution varies across the volume, and validate these simulations experimentally using a commercial calibration phantom.

While AI-driven dietary assessment has made strides in recent years, the ill-posed nature of recovering size (portion) information from monocular images for accurate estimation of ``how much did you eat?'' is a pressing challenge. Some 3D reconstruction methods have achieved impressive geometric reconstruction but fail to recover the crucial real-world scale of the reconstructed object, limiting its usage in precision nutrition. In this paper, we bridge the gap between 3D computer vision and digital health by proposing a method that recovers a true-to-scale 3D reconstructed object from a monocular image. Our approach leverages rich visual features extracted from models trained on large-scale datasets to estimate the scale of the reconstructed object.

In this work, we propose Gap-K%, a novel pretraining data detection method grounded in the optimization dynamics of LLM pretraining. By analyzing the next-token prediction objective, we observe that discrepancies between the model's top-1 prediction and the target token induce strong gradient signals, which are explicitly penalized during training. Motivated by this, Gap-K% leverages the log probability gap between the top-1 predicted token and the target token, incorporating a sliding window strategy to capture local correlations and mitigate token-level fluctuations.

A ubiquitous problem in these and other applications is the ability to control the concentration of specific regulatory factors in the cell accurately despite environmental uncertainty and perturbations. The paper describes the origin of these perturbations and how they affect the dynamics of the biomolecular ``plant'' to be controlled. A variety of biomolecular control implementations are then introduced to achieve robustness of the plant's output to perturbations and are grouped into feedback and feedforward control architectures. Although sophisticated control laws can be implemented in a computer today, they cannot be necessarily implemented inside the cell via biomolecular processes. This fact constraints the set of feasible control laws to those realizable through biomolecular processes that can be engineered with synthetic biology. After reviewing biomolecular feedback and feedforward control implementations, mostly focusing on the author's own work, the paper illustrates the application of such control strategies to cell fate reprogramming. Within this context, a master regulatory factor needs to be controlled at a specific level inside the cell in order to reprogram skin cells to pluripotent stem cells.

SegRap2025 comprises two tasks: Task01 addresses GTV segmentation using paired CT from the SegRap2023 dataset, with an additional external testing set to evaluate cross-center generalization, and Task02 focuses on LN CTV segmentation using multi-center training data and an unseen external testing set, where each case contains paired CT scans or a single modality, emphasizing both cross-center and cross-modality robustness.

To address these limitations, we introduce DiSa, a novel saliency-aware foreground-background disentangled framework. By explicitly incorporating saliency cues in our designed Saliency-aware Disentanglement Module (SDM), DiSa separately models foreground and background ensemble features in a divide-and-conquer manner.

Across WikiHow and RecipeNLG tasks with withheld preconditions, SQ-BCP reduces resource-violation rates to \\textbf{14.9\\%} and \\textbf{5.8\\%} (vs.\\ \\textbf{26.0\\%} and \\textbf{15.7\\%} for the best baseline), while maintaining competitive reference quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aSQ-BCP\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e0b\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u7684\u9884\u7f6e\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u89c4\u5212\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5bb9\u6613\u5931\u8d25\uff1a\u5f53\u4efb\u52a1\u5173\u952e\u9884\u7f6e\u6761\u4ef6\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u65f6\u672a\u660e\u786e\u6307\u5b9a\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5f80\u5f80\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5e7b\u89c9\u6216\u8fdd\u53cd\u786c\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u8ba1\u5212", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u81ea\u6211\u67e5\u8be2\u53cc\u5411\u5206\u7c7b\u89c4\u5212\uff08SQ-BCP\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u660e\u786e\u8868\u793a\u9884\u7f6e\u6761\u4ef6\u72b6\u6001\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u6211\u67e5\u8be2\u6216\u6865\u63a5\u5047\u8bbe\u89e3\u51b3\u672a\u77e5\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b3\uff09\u6267\u884c\u53cc\u5411\u641c\u7d22\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u62c9\u56de\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u8bc1\u4e66\uff1b4\uff09\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u8fdb\u884c\u6392\u5e8f\u548c\u526a\u679d", "result": "\u5728WikiHow\u548cRecipeNLG\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cSQ-BCP\u5c06\u8d44\u6e90\u8fdd\u89c4\u7387\u5206\u522b\u964d\u81f314.9%\u548c5.8%\uff08\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e3a26.0%\u548c15.7%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u8d28\u91cf", "conclusion": "SQ-BCP\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u89c4\u5212\u8fdd\u89c4\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1"}}

However, variations in individual experiences and different levels of device interactions lead to data and model initialization heterogeneities across devices. Such heterogeneities leave variations in local model parameters across devices that leads to slower convergence. This paper tackles the data and model heterogeneity by explicitly addressing the parameter level varying evidential credence across local models. A novel aggregation approach is introduced that captures these parameter variations in local models and performs robust aggregation of neighbourhood local updates. Specifically, consensus weights are generated via approximation of second-order information of local models on their local datasets. These weights are utilized to scale neighbourhood updates before aggregating them into global neighbourhood representation. In extensive experiments with computer vision tasks, the proposed approach shows strong generalizability of local models at reduced communication costs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6536\u655b\u7f13\u6162\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8c\u9636\u4fe1\u606f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6355\u83b7\u672c\u5730\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u9c81\u68d2\u805a\u5408", "motivation": "\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2a\u4f53\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5c42\u6b21\u4e0d\u540c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u4f7f\u5f97\u672c\u5730\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5b58\u5728\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u964d\u4f4e\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u79cd\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd1\u4f3c\u672c\u5730\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5176\u672c\u5730\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u4e8c\u9636\u4fe1\u606f\u751f\u6210\u5171\u8bc6\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6743\u91cd\u7f29\u653e\u90bb\u5c45\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u805a\u5408\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u90bb\u5c45\u8868\u793a", "result": "\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u672c\u5730\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u53bb\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8c\u9636\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u805a\u5408\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd"}}

While Layer-coded Hybrid ARQ (L-HARQ) enhances reliability, its backtracking decoding introduces age ambiguity, undermining the standard Age of Information (AoI) metric and obscuring the critical trade-off between data freshness and transmission efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel cross-layer optimization framework centered on a new metric, the Cross-layer Age of Error Information (C-AoEI). We derive a closed-form expression for C-AoEI, explicitly linking freshness to system parameters, establishing an explicit analytical connection between freshness degradation and channel dynamics. Building on this, we develop a packet-level encoded L-HARQ scheme for multi-GBS scenarios and an adaptive algorithm that jointly optimizes coding and decision thresholds. Extensive simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework: it achieves 31.8% higher transmission efficiency and 17.2% lower C-AoEI than conventional schemes. The framework also proves robust against inter-cell interference and varying channel conditions, providing a foundation for designing efficient, latency-aware next-generation S-IoT protocols.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our proposed Task-Based Information Gain (TBIG) strategy applies to any differentiable downstream task function. When applied to recovering ventricular dimensions from echocardiograms, TBIG recovers accurate results using fewer than 2% of scan lines typically used, showing potential for large reductions in the power usage and data rates necessary for monitoring.

Existing category-theoretic planners provide compositional structure and pullback-based hard-constraint verification, but treat applicability as crisp, forcing thresholding that collapses meaningful distinctions and cannot track quality degradation across multi-step plans. We propose Fuzzy Category-theoretic Planning (FCP), which annotates each action (morphism) with a degree in [0,1], composes plan quality via a t-norm Lukasiewicz, and retains crisp executability checks via pullback verification.

Image-level mixed sample data augmentations, such as CutMix and MixUp, are frequently used for training transformers, yet these techniques perturb patient-specific attributes, such as medical comorbidity and clinical factors, since they only account for images and labels. To address this limitation, we propose a hierarchical sampling strategy, Oculomix, for mixed sample augmentations. Our method is based on two clinical priors. First (exam level), images acquired from the same patient at the same time point share the same attributes. Second (patient level), images acquired from the same patient at different time points have a soft temporal trend, as morbidity generally increases over time. Guided by these priors, our method constrains the mixing space to the patient and exam levels to better preserve patient-specific characteristics and leverages their hierarchical relationships. The proposed method is validated using ViT models on a five-year prediction of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in a large ethnically diverse population (Alzeye). We show that Oculomix consistently outperforms image-level CutMix and MixUp by up to 3% in AUROC, demonstrating the necessity and value of the proposed method in oculomics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faOculomix\u5206\u5c42\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6539\u8fdb\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u6df7\u5408\u91c7\u6837\u7834\u574f\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u5c5e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u63d0\u53473%AUROC", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7\u6df7\u5408\u6837\u672c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff08\u5982CutMix\u3001MixUp\uff09\u5728\u773c\u79d1\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u5171\u75c5\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u56e0\u7d20\uff09\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u8003\u8651\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u672a\u8003\u8651\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e34\u5e8a\u5148\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5206\u5c42\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565Oculomix\uff1a1\uff09\u68c0\u67e5\u5c42\u9762-\u540c\u4e00\u60a3\u8005\u540c\u4e00\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u56fe\u50cf\u5171\u4eab\u76f8\u540c\u5c5e\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u60a3\u8005\u5c42\u9762-\u540c\u4e00\u60a3\u8005\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u56fe\u50cf\u5448\u73b0\u8f6f\u65f6\u95f4\u8d8b\u52bf\uff08\u53d1\u75c5\u7387\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u589e\u52a0\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ea6\u675f\u6df7\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u5230\u60a3\u8005\u548c\u68c0\u67e5\u5c42\u6b21\u6765\u4fdd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5c42\u5173\u7cfb", "result": "\u5728\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4eba\u7fa4\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08Alzeye\uff09\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528ViT\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e94\u5e74\u4e3b\u8981\u4e0d\u826f\u5fc3\u8840\u7ba1\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08MACE\uff09\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eOculomix\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7CutMix\u548cMixUp\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe3%AUROC", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u5728\u773c\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u8003\u8651\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u62a4\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u7279\u5f81\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u7b56\u7565"}}

To answer it, we first determine the number of columns to be added to a generator matrix of a linear code in order to embed the given code into an LCD code. Then we characterize all possible forms of shortest LCD embeddings of a linear code. As examples, we start from binary and ternary Hamming codes of small lengths and obtain optimal LCD codes with minimum distance 4. Furthermore, we find new ternary LCD codes with parameters including $[23, 4, 14]$, $[23, 5, 12]$, $[24, 6, 12]$, and $[25, 5, 14]$ and a new quaternary LCD $[21, 10, 8]$ code, each of which has minimum distance one greater than those of known codes.

Although control barrier certificates have been extensively studied for safety analysis of control systems, existing work on unknown systems with time delays, particularly in the presence of disturbances, remains limited. The challenge of safety synthesis for such systems stems from two main factors: first, the system's mathematical model is unavailable; and second, the safety conditions should explicitly incorporate the effects of time delays on system evolution during the synthesis process, while remaining robust to unknown disturbances. To address these challenges, we develop a data-driven framework based on Krasovskii control barrier certificates, extending the classical CBC formulation for delay-free systems to explicitly account for time delays by aggregating delayed components within the barrier construction. The proposed framework relies solely on input-state data collected over a finite time horizon, enabling the direct synthesis of RK-CBC and R-SC from observed trajectories without requiring an explicit system model. The synthesis is cast as a data-driven sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization program, yielding a structured design methodology. As a result, robust safety is guaranteed in the presence of unknown disturbances and time delays over an infinite time horizon. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through three case studies, including two physical systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Standard first-order optimizers, such as SGD and Adam, struggle with \\emph{gradient conflicts} arising from competing objectives, leading to slow convergence and suboptimal rate-distortion performance. In this work, we demonstrate that a simple utilization of a second-order quasi-Newton optimizer, \\textbf{SOAP}, dramatically improves both training efficiency and final performance across diverse LICs. Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that Newton preconditioning inherently resolves the intra-step and inter-step update conflicts intrinsic to the R-D objective, facilitating faster, more stable convergence. Beyond acceleration, we uncover a critical deployability benefit: second-order trained models exhibit significantly fewer activation and latent outliers. This substantially enhances robustness to post-training quantization. Together, these results establish second-order optimization, achievable as a seamless drop-in replacement of the imported optimizer, as a powerful, practical tool for advancing the efficiency and real-world readiness of LICs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8c\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u5668SOAP\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u4e00\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u3001\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u91cf\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6\u4e00\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff08\u5982SGD\u548cAdam\uff09\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u901f\u7387-\u5931\u771f\u6743\u8861\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6536\u655b\u7f13\u6162\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u6b20\u4f73\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6839\u672c\u4f18\u5316\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7b80\u5355\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8c\u9636\u51c6\u725b\u987f\u4f18\u5316\u5668SOAP\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u725b\u987f\u9884\u6761\u4ef6\u5982\u4f55\u5185\u5728\u5730\u89e3\u51b3R-D\u76ee\u6807\u4e2d\u7684\u6b65\u5185\u548c\u6b65\u95f4\u66f4\u65b0\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u5c42\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "SOAP\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u6fc0\u6d3b\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u5c42\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e8c\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7387\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u51c6\u5907\u7684\u6709\u529b\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Despite its success, CLIP's dense and opaque latent representations pose significant interpretability challenges. A common assumption is that interpretability and performance are in tension: enforcing sparsity during training degrades accuracy, motivating recent post-hoc approaches such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). However, these post-hoc approaches often suffer from degraded downstream performance and loss of CLIP's inherent multimodal capabilities, with most learned features remaining unimodal.\n  We propose a simple yet effective approach that integrates sparsity directly into CLIP training, yielding representations that are both interpretable and performant. Compared to SAEs, our Sparse CLIP representations preserve strong downstream task performance, achieve superior interpretability, and retain multimodal capabilities. We show that multimodal sparse features enable straightforward semantic concept alignment and reveal training dynamics of how cross-modal knowledge emerges. Finally, as a proof of concept, we train a vision-language model on sparse CLIP representations that enables interpretable, vision-based steering capabilities.

Our hypothesis is that IA will serve as a force multiplier for sellers, thereby driving incremental seller adoption by reducing the effort required and increase speed at which sellers make good business decisions. In this paper, we introduce this novel LLM-backed end-to-end agentic system built on a plan-and-execute paradigm and designed for comprehensive coverage, high accuracy, and low latency. It features a hierarchical multi-agent structure, consisting of manager agent and two worker agents: data presentation and insight generation, for efficient information retrieval and problem-solving. We design a simple yet effective ML solution for manager agent that combines Out-of-Domain (OOD) detection using a lightweight encoder-decoder model and agent routing through a BERT-based classifier, optimizing both accuracy and latency. Within the two worker agents, a strategic planning is designed for API-based data model that breaks down queries into granular components to generate more accurate responses, and domain knowledge is dynamically injected to to enhance the insight generator.

Chou", "Taejoon Kim"], "title": "Helper-Assisted Coding for Gaussian Wiretap Channels: Deep Learning Meets PhySec", "comment": null, "summary": "Consider the Gaussian wiretap channel, where a transmitter wishes to send a confidential message to a legitimate receiver in the presence of an eavesdropper. It is well known that if the eavesdropper experiences less channel noise than the legitimate receiver, then it is impossible for the transmitter to achieve positive secrecy rates. A known solution to this issue consists in involving a second transmitter, referred to as a helper, to help the first transmitter to achieve security. While such a solution has been studied for the asymptotic blocklength regime and via non-constructive coding schemes, in this paper, for the first time, we design explicit and short blocklength codes using deep learning and cryptographic tools to demonstrate the benefit and practicality of cooperation between two transmitters over the wiretap channel. Specifically, our proposed codes show strict improvement in terms of information leakage compared to existing codes that do not consider a helper. Our code design approach relies on a reliability layer, implemented with an autoencoder architecture based on the successive interference cancellation method, and a security layer implemented with universal hash functions. We also propose an alternative autoencoder architecture that significantly reduces training time by allowing the decoders to independently estimate messages without successively canceling interference by the receiver during training. Additionally, we show that our code design is also applicable to the multiple access wiretap channel with helpers, where two transmitters send confidential messages to the legitimate receiver.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u660e\u786e\u4e14\u77ed\u5757\u957f\u7684\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u7a83\u542c\u4fe1\u9053\u4e2d\u4e24\u4e2a\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u76ca\u5904\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e0d\u8003\u8651\u534f\u52a9\u8005\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u4e25\u683c\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u7a83\u542c\u4fe1\u9053\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u7a83\u542c\u8005\u7ecf\u5386\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u566a\u58f0\u5c11\u4e8e\u5408\u6cd5\u63a5\u6536\u8005\u65f6\uff0c\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6b63\u4fdd\u5bc6\u7387\u3002\u5df2\u6709\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6d89\u53ca\u7b2c\u4e8c\u4e2a\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\uff08\u534f\u52a9\u8005\uff09\u6765\u5e2e\u52a9\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6848\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u6e10\u8fdb\u5757\u957f\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4e14\u91c7\u7528\u975e\u6784\u9020\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5c42\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u5c42\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5c42\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fde\u7eed\u5e72\u6270\u6d88\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff1b\u5b89\u5168\u5c42\u91c7\u7528\u901a\u7528\u54c8\u5e0c\u51fd\u6570\u3002\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u66ff\u4ee3\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5141\u8bb8\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u72ec\u7acb\u4f30\u8ba1\u6d88\u606f\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u8fde\u7eed\u6d88\u9664\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u65b9\u9762\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e0d\u8003\u8651\u534f\u52a9\u8005\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u7f16\u7801\u6709\u4e25\u683c\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u4e14\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5e26\u6709\u534f\u52a9\u8005\u7684\u591a\u5740\u63a5\u5165\u7a83\u542c\u4fe1\u9053\uff08\u4e24\u4e2a\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u5411\u5408\u6cd5\u63a5\u6536\u8005\u53d1\u9001\u4fdd\u5bc6\u6d88\u606f\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5bc6\u7801\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u660e\u786e\u77ed\u5757\u957f\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5b9e\u9645\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u7a83\u542c\u4fe1\u9053\u4e2d\u53d1\u5c04\u673a\u5408\u4f5c\u7684\u76ca\u5904\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u4fe1\u9053\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0d\u5229\u65f6\u7684\u4fdd\u5bc6\u901a\u4fe1\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A modified SEANet-style vector-quantizer reduces multichannel MEG into a flattened token stream on which we train a Qwen2.5-VL backbone from scratch to predict the next brain token and to recursively generate minutes of MEG from up to a minute of context. To evaluate long-horizon generation, we introduce three task-matched tests: (i) on-manifold stability via generated-only drift compared to the time-resolved distribution of real sliding windows, and (ii) conditional specificity via correct context versus prompt-swap controls using a neurophysiologically grounded metric set. We train on CamCAN and Omega and run all analyses on held-out MOUS, establishing cross-dataset generalization. Across metrics, generations remain relatively stable over long rollouts and are closer to the correct continuation than swapped controls.

Through an offline calibration phase, the proposed conformal counterfactual generation (CCG) yields sets of counterfactual outcomes that are guaranteed to contain the true counterfactual outcome with high probability. We showcase the performance of CCG on a wireless network control use case, demonstrating significant advantages compared to naive re-execution baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Prior research (e.g., Light-ColPali) attributes this to the conclusion that visual token importance is inherently query-dependent, thereby questioning the feasibility of training-free pruning. In this work, we propose Structural Anchor Pruning (SAP), a training-free pruning method that identifies key visual patches from middle layers to achieve high performance compression. We also introduce Oracle Score Retention (OSR) protocol to evaluate how layer-wise information affects compression efficiency. Evaluations on the ViDoRe benchmark demonstrate that SAP reduces index vectors by over 90% while maintaining robust retrieval fidelity, providing a highly scalable solution for Visual RAG.

End-to-end latency, as a key real-time attribute of cause-effect chains, is crucial in many applications. But the analysis of end-to-end latency for cause-effect chains on multicore platforms with shared caches still presents an unresolved issue. Traditional methods typically assume that the worst-case execution time (WCET) of each task in the cause-effect chain is known. However, in the absence of scheduling information, these methods often assume that all shared cache accesses result in misses, leading to an overestimation of WCET and, consequently, affecting the accuracy of end-to-end latency. However, effectively integrating scheduling information into the WCET analysis process of the chains may introduce two challenges: first, how to leverage the structural characteristics of the chains to optimize shared cache analysis, and second, how to improve analysis accuracy while avoiding state space explosion.\n  To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel end-to-end latency analysis framework designed for multi-chain systems on multicore platforms with shared caches. This framework extracts scheduling information and structural characteristics of cause-effect chains, constructing fine-grained and scalable inter-core memory access contexts at the basic block level for time-sensitive shared cache analysis. This results in more accurate WCET (TSC-WCET) estimates, which are then used to derive the end-to-end latency. Finally, we conduct experiments on dual-core and quad-core systems with various cache configurations, which show that under certain settings, the average maximum end-to-end latency of cause-effect chains is reduced by up to 34% and 26%.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, their bidirectional attention mechanism and diffusion-style iterative denoising paradigm introduce significant computational overhead, as visual tokens are repeatedly processed across all layers and denoising steps. In this work, we conduct an in-depth attention analysis and reveal that, unlike autoregressive decoders, LLaDA-V aggregates cross-modal information predominantly in middle-to-late layers, leading to delayed semantic alignment. Motivated by this observation, we propose a structured token pruning strategy inspired by FastV, selectively removing a proportion of visual tokens at designated layers to reduce FLOPs while preserving critical semantic information. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to investigate structured token pruning in diffusion-based large multimodal models. Unlike FastV, which focuses on shallow-layer pruning, our method targets the middle-to-late layers of the first denoising step to align with LLaDA-V's delayed attention aggregation to maintain output quality, and the first-step pruning strategy reduces the computation across all subsequent steps. Our framework provides an empirical basis for efficient LLaDA-V inference and highlights the potential of vision-aware pruning in diffusion-based multimodal models.

We introduce $\\method$, an agentic framework that addresses these limitations by training medical reasoning verifiers to iteratively query external medical corpora during evaluation. Our approach combines tool-augmented verification with an iterative reinforcement learning paradigm that requires only trace-level supervision, alongside an adaptive curriculum mechanism that dynamically adjusts training data distribution.

However, such flexibility may introduce timing anomalies, wherein locally reduced execution times can lead to an increase in the overall system execution time. This phenomenon significantly complicates the analysis of Worst-Case Response Time (WCRT), rendering conventional analysis either overly pessimistic or unsafe, and often necessitating exhaustive state-space exploration to ensure correctness.\n  To address this challenge, this paper presents the first timing-anomaly-free dynamic scheduling algorithm for heterogeneous systems, referred to as Deterministic Dynamic Execution. It achieves a safe and tight WCRT estimate through a single offline simulation execution. The core idea is to apply deterministic execution constraints, which partially restrict the resource allocation and execution order of tasks at runtime. Based on a formally defined execution progress model for heterogeneous system scheduling, we prove the correctness of the proposed execution constraints and their ability to eliminate timing anomalies. Furthermore, we propose two methods to generate execution constraints. The first method derives execution constraints directly from the execution traces produced by existing scheduling algorithms. The second method is a heuristic-based approach that constructs execution constraints, enabling further reduction of the WCRT. Experimental results on synthetically generated DAG task sets under various system configurations demonstrate that, compared to traditional dynamic scheduling algorithms, our approach not only eliminates timing anomalies but also effectively reduces both the WCRT and response time jitter.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u6267\u884c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5f02\u6784\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u65f6\u5e8f\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u79bb\u7ebf\u6a21\u62df\u6267\u884c\u83b7\u5f97\u5b89\u5168\u4e14\u7d27\u81f4\u7684WCRT\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f02\u6784\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u5229\u7528\u7387\u548c\u8c03\u5ea6\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u65f6\u5e8f\u5f02\u5e38\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5373\u5c40\u90e8\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u51cf\u5c11\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6574\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u6790\u53d8\u5f97\u5f02\u5e38\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5e38\u89c4\u5206\u6790\u8981\u4e48\u8fc7\u4e8e\u60b2\u89c2\u8981\u4e48\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u7a77\u4e3e\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a2\u7d22\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6267\u884c\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5728\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u90e8\u5206\u9650\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8d44\u6e90\u5206\u914d\u548c\u6267\u884c\u987a\u5e8f\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u5ea6\u6267\u884c\u8fdb\u5c55\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u6267\u884c\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u6d88\u9664\u65f6\u5e8f\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u6267\u884c\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u73b0\u6709\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u63a8\u5bfc\uff1b2\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6784\u5efa\u6267\u884c\u7ea6\u675f\u4ee5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u964d\u4f4eWCRT\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5bf9\u5408\u6210\u7684DAG\u4efb\u52a1\u96c6\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u6d88\u9664\u4e86\u65f6\u5e8f\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u6296\u52a8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u6267\u884c\u7b97\u6cd5\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u65e0\u65f6\u5e8f\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b89\u5168\u4e14\u7d27\u81f4\u7684WCRT\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6296\u52a8\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f02\u6784\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u65f6\u8c03\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In this technical report, we present TeleStyle, a lightweight yet effective model for both image and video stylization. Built upon Qwen-Image-Edit, TeleStyle leverages the base model's robust capabilities in content preservation and style customization. To facilitate effective training, we curated a high-quality dataset of distinct specific styles and further synthesized triplets using thousands of diverse, in-the-wild style categories. We introduce a Curriculum Continual Learning framework to train TeleStyle on this hybrid dataset of clean (curated) and noisy (synthetic) triplets. This approach enables the model to generalize to unseen styles without compromising precise content fidelity. Additionally, we introduce a video-to-video stylization module to enhance temporal consistency and visual quality.

We identify this as a Cognitive Gap: the model lacks the understanding of how to enhance its own generation process. To bridge this gap, we propose Endogenous Reprompting, a mechanism that transforms the model's understanding from a passive encoding process into an explicit generative reasoning step by generating self-aligned descriptors during generation. To achieve this, we introduce SEER (Self-Evolving Evaluator and Reprompter), a training framework that establishes a two-stage endogenous loop using only 300 samples from a compact proxy task, Visual Instruction Elaboration.

Antunes"], "title": "Tilt-based Aberration Estimation in Transmission Electron Microscopy", "comment": "Submitted version (pre-print)", "summary": "Transmission electron microscopes (TEMs) enable atomic-scale imaging but suffer from aberrations caused by lens imperfections and environmental conditions, reducing image quality. These aberrations can be compensated by adjusting electromagnetic lenses, but this requires accurate estimates of the aberration coefficients, which can drift over time. This paper introduces a method for the estimation of aberrations in TEM by leveraging the relationship between an induced electron beam tilt and the resulting image shift. The method uses a Kalman filter (KF) to estimate the aberration coefficients from a sequence of image shifts, while accounting for the drift of the aberrations over time. The applied tilt sequence is optimized by minimizing the trace of the predicted error covariance in the KF, which corresponds to the A-optimality criterion in experimental design. We show that this optimization can be performed offline, as the cost criterion is independent of the actual measurements. The resulting non-convex optimization problem is solved using a gradient-based, receding-horizon approach with multi-starts. Additionally, we develop an approach to estimate specimen-dependent noise properties using expectation maximization (EM), which are then used to tailor the tilt pattern optimization to the specific specimen being imaged.

However, in high-mobility environment such as emerging 5G Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), the extreme orbital velocities of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites frequently cause the physical Doppler shifts to exceed the fundamental grid range. This Doppler ambiguity induces severe model mismatch and renders traditional MLE channel estimators ineffective. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel low-complexity pilot-aided Doppler ambiguity detection and compensation framework. We first mathematically derive the OTFS input-output relationship in the presence of aliasing, revealing that Doppler ambiguity manifests itself as a distinct phase rotation along the delay dimension. Leveraging this insight, we developed a two-stage estimator that utilizes pairwise phase differences between pilot symbols to identify the integer ambiguity, followed by a refined Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) for channel recovery. We investigate two pilot arrangements, Embedded Pilot with Guard Zone (EP-GZ) and Data-Surrounded Pilot (DSP), to analyze the trade-off between interference suppression and spectral efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme effectively eliminates the error floor caused by ambiguity, achieving Bit Error Rate (BER) and Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE) performance comparable to the exhaustive search benchmark while maintaining a computational complexity similar to standard MLE.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Each edge is modeled as either a binary symmetric channel (BSC) or a binary erasure channel (BEC). We analyze two operational regimes. For binary symmetric and binary erasure channels, we provide a structural characterization of the induced learning dynamics. In a fast-communication regime, agents update using channel-averaged payoffs; the resulting learning dynamics coincide with a Gibbs sampler for a scaled coordination potential, where channel reliability enters only through a scalar attenuation coefficient. In a snapshot regime, agents update from a single noisy realization and ignore channel statistics; the induced Markov chain is generally nonreversible, but admits a high-temperature expansion whose drift matches that of the fast Gibbs sampler with the same attenuation. We further formalize a finite-$K$ communication budget, which interpolates between snapshot and fast behavior as the number of channel uses per update grows. This viewpoint yields a communication-theoretic interpretation in terms of retransmissions and repetition coding, and extends naturally to heterogeneous link reliabilities via effective edge weights.

Nevertheless, they still suffer from the sparse reward problem: the terminal reward of the entire denoising trajectory is applied to all intermediate steps, resulting in a mismatch between the global feedback signals and the exact fine-grained contributions at intermediate denoising steps. To address this issue, we introduce \\textbf{DenseGRPO}, a novel framework that aligns human preference with dense rewards, which evaluates the fine-grained contribution of each denoising step. Specifically, our approach includes two key components: (1) we propose to predict the step-wise reward gain as dense reward of each denoising step, which applies a reward model on the intermediate clean images via an ODE-based approach. This manner ensures an alignment between feedback signals and the contributions of individual steps, facilitating effective training; and (2) based on the estimated dense rewards, a mismatch drawback between the uniform exploration setting and the time-varying noise intensity in existing GRPO-based methods is revealed, leading to an inappropriate exploration space. Thus, we propose a reward-aware scheme to calibrate the exploration space by adaptively adjusting a timestep-specific stochasticity injection in the SDE sampler, ensuring a suitable exploration space at all timesteps. Extensive experiments on multiple standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DenseGRPO and highlight the critical role of the valid dense rewards in flow matching model alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Benefiting from the strong capabilities of LLMs, recent research focus has shifted from simple context extension to the development of dedicated agentic memory systems. However, existing approaches typically rely on rigid retrieval granularity, accumulation-heavy maintenance strategies, and coarse-grained update mechanisms. These design choices create a persistent mismatch between stored information and task-specific reasoning demands, while leading to the unchecked accumulation of logical inconsistencies over time. To address these challenges, we propose Adaptive Memory via Multi-Agent Collaboration (AMA), a novel framework that leverages coordinated agents to manage memory across multiple granularities. AMA employs a hierarchical memory design that dynamically aligns retrieval granularity with task complexity. Specifically, the Constructor and Retriever jointly enable multi-granularity memory construction and adaptive query routing.

Existing caching methods reduce redundant computation but typically rely on instantaneous velocity information (e.g., feature caching), which often leads to severe trajectory deviations and error accumulation under high acceleration ratios. MeanCache introduces an average-velocity perspective: by leveraging cached Jacobian--vector products (JVP) to construct interval average velocities from instantaneous velocities, it effectively mitigates local error accumulation. To further improve cache timing and JVP reuse stability, we develop a trajectory-stability scheduling strategy as a practical tool, employing a Peak-Suppressed Shortest Path under budget constraints to determine the schedule. Experiments on FLUX.1, Qwen-Image, and HunyuanVideo demonstrate that MeanCache achieves 4.12X and 4.56X and 3.59X acceleration, respectively, while consistently outperforming state-of-the-art caching baselines in generation quality. We believe this simple yet effective approach provides a new perspective for Flow Matching inference and will inspire further exploration of stability-driven acceleration in commercial-scale generative models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we study rectified flow models, which constrain transport trajectories to be linear from the base distribution to the data distribution. This structural restriction greatly accelerates sampling, often enabling high-quality generation with a single Euler step. Under standard assumptions on the neural network classes used to parameterize the velocity field and data distribution, we prove that rectified flows achieve sample complexity $\\tilde{O}(\\varepsilon^{-2})$. This improves on the best known $O(\\varepsilon^{-4})$ bounds for flow matching model and matches the optimal rate for mean estimation. Our analysis exploits the particular structure of rectified flows: because the model is trained with a squared loss along linear paths, the associated hypothesis class admits a sharply controlled localized Rademacher complexity. This yields the improved, order-optimal sample complexity and provides a theoretical explanation for the strong empirical performance of rectified flow models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce Policy of Thoughts (PoT), a framework that recasts reasoning as a within-instance online optimization process. PoT first generates diverse candidate solutions via an efficient exploration mechanism, then uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to update a transient LoRA adapter based on execution feedback. This closed-loop design enables dynamic, instance-specific refinement of the model's reasoning priors.

This issue is further exacerbated in practice, as retraining or adapting decoders becomes particularly challenging when only limited data are available from a new session. To address this challenge, we propose a Task-Conditioned Latent Alignment framework (TCLA) for cross-session neural decoding. Building upon an autoencoder architecture, TCLA first learns a low-dimensional representation of neural dynamics from a source session with sufficient data. For target sessions with limited data, TCLA then aligns target latent representations to the source in a task-conditioned manner, enabling effective transfer of learned neural dynamics. We evaluate TCLA on the macaque motor and oculomotor center-out dataset. Compared to baseline methods trained solely on target-session data, TCLA consistently improves decoding performance across datasets and decoding settings, with gains in the coefficient of determination of up to 0.386 for y coordinate velocity decoding in a motor dataset. These results suggest that TCLA provides an effective strategy for transferring knowledge from source to target sessions, enabling more robust neural decoding under conditions with limited data.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The model enables daily use with low error and clear interpretability.

Machine-learning (ML) controllers are increasingly deployed in (autonomous) cyber-physical systems because of their ability to solve complex decision-making tasks. However, their accuracy can degrade sharply in unfamiliar environments, creating significant safety concerns. Traditional ensemble methods aim to improve robustness by averaging or voting across multiple controllers, yet this often dilutes the specialized strengths that individual controllers exhibit in different operating contexts. We argue that, rather than blending controller outputs, a monitoring framework should identify and exploit these contextual strengths. In this paper, we reformulate the design of safe AI-based control ensembles as a contextual monitoring problem. A monitor continuously observes the system's context and selects the controller best suited to the current conditions. To achieve this, we cast monitor learning as a contextual learning task and draw on techniques from contextual multi-armed bandits. Our approach comes with two key benefits: (1) theoretical safety guarantees during controller selection, and (2) improved utilization of controller diversity. We validate our framework in two simulated autonomous driving scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in both safety and performance compared to non-contextual baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing approaches remain limited in reliably distinguishing hallucinated from factually grounded outputs, as they rely solely on forward-pass attention patterns and neglect gradient-based signals that reveal how token influence propagates through the network. To bridge this gap, we introduce LVLMs-Saliency, a gradient-aware diagnostic framework that quantifies the visual grounding strength of each output token by fusing attention weights with their input gradients. Our analysis uncovers a decisive pattern: hallucinations frequently arise when preceding output tokens exhibit low saliency toward the prediction of the next token, signaling a breakdown in contextual memory retention. Leveraging this insight, we propose a dual-mechanism inference-time framework to mitigate hallucinations: (1) Saliency-Guided Rejection Sampling (SGRS), which dynamically filters candidate tokens during autoregressive decoding by rejecting those whose saliency falls below a context-adaptive threshold, thereby preventing coherence-breaking tokens from entering the output sequence; and (2) Local Coherence Reinforcement (LocoRE), a lightweight, plug-and-play module that strengthens attention from the current token to its most recent predecessors, actively counteracting the contextual forgetting behavior identified by LVLMs-Saliency. Extensive experiments across multiple LVLMs demonstrate that our method significantly reduces hallucination rates while preserving fluency and task performance, offering a robust and interpretable solution for enhancing model reliability.

Based on this ansatz, sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have recently become a popular method for decomposing embeddings into a sparse combination of linear directions, which have been shown empirically to often correspond to human-interpretable semantics. However, recent attempts to apply SAEs to multimodal embedding spaces (such as the popular CLIP embeddings for image/text data) have found that SAEs often learn \"split dictionaries\", where most of the learned sparse features are essentially unimodal, active only for data of a single modality. In this work, we study how to effectively adapt SAEs for the setting of multimodal embeddings while ensuring multimodal alignment. We first argue that the existence of a split dictionary decomposition on an aligned embedding space implies the existence of a non-split dictionary with improved modality alignment. Then, we propose a new SAE-based approach to multimodal embedding decomposition using cross-modal random masking and group-sparse regularization. We apply our method to popular embeddings for image/text (CLIP) and audio/text (CLAP) data and show that, compared to standard SAEs, our approach learns a more multimodal dictionary while reducing the number of dead neurons and improving feature semanticity. We finally demonstrate how this improvement in alignment of concepts between modalities can enable improvements in the interpretability and control of cross-modal tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing DA methods often require access to source domain data, adversarial training, or complex pseudo-labeling techniques, which are computationally expensive. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a novel source-free domain adaptation method. It is the first approach to use multiview augmentation and latent space consistency techniques to learn domain-invariant features directly from the target domain. Our method eliminates the need for source-target alignment or pseudo-label refinement by learning transferable representations solely from the target domain by enforcing consistency between multiple augmented views in the latent space. Additionally, the method ensures consistency in the learned features by generating multiple augmented views of target domain data and minimizing the distance between their feature representations in the latent space.

A policy evaluation algorithm for ICVaR is developed with finite-time performance guarantees that do not depend on the cardinality of the action space. Building on this foundation, three widely used online planning algorithms--Sparse Sampling, Particle Filter Trees with Double Progressive Widening (PFT-DPW), and Partially Observable Monte Carlo Planning with Observation Widening (POMCPOW)--are extended to optimize the ICVaR value function rather than the expectation of the return. Our formulations introduce a risk parameter $\u03b1$, where $\u03b1= 1$ recovers standard expectation-based planning and $\u03b1< 1$ induces increasing risk aversion. For ICVaR Sparse Sampling, we establish finite-time performance guarantees under the risk-sensitive objective, which further enable a novel exploration strategy tailored to ICVaR. Experiments on benchmark POMDP domains demonstrate that the proposed ICVaR planners achieve lower tail risk compared to their risk-neutral counterparts.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing approaches typically offer coarse video quality scores, lacking detailed localization and categorization of specific artifacts. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive evaluation protocol focusing on three key aspects affecting human perception: Appearance, Motion, and Camera. We define these axes through a taxonomy of 10 prevalent artifact categories reflecting common generative failures observed in video generation. To enable robust artifact detection and categorization, we introduce GenVID, a large-scale dataset of 80k videos generated by various state-of-the-art video generation models, each carefully annotated for the defined artifact categories. Leveraging GenVID, we develop DVAR, a Dense Video Artifact Recognition framework for fine-grained identification and classification of generative artifacts.

Code and data: https://github.com/jgraycox-coa/vcw-multi-ai-dialogue", "summary": "This paper introduces a methodological framework for empirically testing AI alignment strategies through structured multi-model dialogue. Drawing on Peace Studies traditions - particularly interest-based negotiation, conflict transformation, and commons governance - we operationalize Viral Collaborative Wisdom (VCW), an approach that reframes alignment from a control problem to a relationship problem developed through dialogical reasoning.\n  Our experimental design assigns four distinct roles (Proposer, Responder, Monitor, Translator) to different AI systems across six conditions, testing whether current large language models can engage substantively with complex alignment frameworks. Using Claude, Gemini, and GPT-4o, we conducted 72 dialogue turns totaling 576,822 characters of structured exchange.\n  Results demonstrate that AI systems can engage meaningfully with Peace Studies concepts, surface complementary objections from different architectural perspectives, and generate emergent insights not present in initial framings - including the novel synthesis of \"VCW as transitional framework.\" Cross-architecture patterns reveal that different models foreground different concerns: Claude emphasized verification challenges, Gemini focused on bias and scalability, and GPT-4o highlighted implementation barriers.\n  The framework provides researchers with replicable methods for stress-testing alignment proposals before implementation, while the findings offer preliminary evidence about AI capacity for the kind of dialogical reasoning VCW proposes. We discuss limitations, including the observation that dialogues engaged more with process elements than with foundational claims about AI nature, and outline directions for future research including human-AI hybrid protocols and extended dialogue studies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u591a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6d4b\u8bd5AI\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u548c\u5e73\u7814\u7a76\u4f20\u7edf\uff0c\u5c06\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u4ece\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u8bdd\u63a8\u7406\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9AI\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u64cd\u4f5c\u5316\u201c\u75c5\u6bd2\u6027\u534f\u4f5c\u667a\u6167\u201d\u8fd9\u4e00\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5176\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u6982\u5ff5\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u56db\u79cd\u89d2\u8272\uff08\u63d0\u8bae\u8005\u3001\u56de\u5e94\u8005\u3001\u76d1\u7763\u8005\u3001\u7ffb\u8bd1\u8005\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u516d\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4f7f\u7528Claude\u3001Gemini\u548cGPT-4o\u7b49\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c72\u8f6e\u5bf9\u8bdd\uff0c\u603b\u8ba1576,822\u5b57\u7b26\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4ea4\u6d41\u3002", "result": "AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u53c2\u4e0e\u548c\u5e73\u7814\u7a76\u6982\u5ff5\u8ba8\u8bba\uff0c\u4ece\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u89c6\u89d2\u63d0\u51fa\u4e92\u8865\u6027\u5f02\u8bae\uff0c\u5e76\u751f\u6210\u521d\u59cb\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u672a\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u65b0\u89c1\u89e3\uff08\u5982\u201cVCW\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fc7\u6e21\u6846\u67b6\u201d\uff09\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u5404\u5f02\uff1aClaude\u5f3a\u8c03\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6311\u6218\uff0cGemini\u5173\u6ce8\u504f\u89c1\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0cGPT-4o\u7a81\u51fa\u5b9e\u65bd\u969c\u788d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5728\u5b9e\u65bd\u524d\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u53ef\u590d\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u521d\u6b65\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660eAI\u5177\u5907VCW\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u5305\u62ec\u5bf9\u8bdd\u66f4\u5173\u6ce8\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8981\u7d20\u800c\u975eAI\u672c\u8d28\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u4e3b\u5f20\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u5305\u62ec\u4eba\u673a\u6df7\u5408\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

However, deploying RAG on edge devices faces efficiency hurdles due to the rapid growth of profile data, such as user-LLM interactions and recent updates. While Computing-in-Memory (CiM) architectures mitigate this bottleneck by eliminating data movement between memory and processing units via in-situ operations, they are susceptible to environmental noise that can degrade retrieval precision. This poses a critical issue in dynamic, multi-domain edge-based scenarios (e.g., travel, medicine, and law) where both accuracy and adaptability are paramount. To address these challenges, we propose Task-Oriented Noise-resilient Embedding Learning (TONEL), a framework that improves noise robustness and domain adaptability for RAG in noisy edge environments. TONEL employs a noise-aware projection model to learn task-specific embeddings compatible with CiM hardware constraints, enabling accurate retrieval under noisy conditions.

However, its interplay with the compactness requirements of on-device DNN deployments remains less explored. Simply pruning a SAM-trained model can undermine robustness, since flatness in the continuous parameter space does not necessarily translate to robustness under the discrete structural changes induced by pruning. Conversely, applying SAM after pruning may be fundamentally constrained by architectural limitations imposed by an early, robustness-agnostic pruning pattern. To address this gap, we propose Compression-aware ShArpness Minimization (C-SAM), a framework that shifts sharpness-aware learning from parameter perturbations to mask perturbations. By explicitly perturbing pruning masks during training, C-SAM promotes a flatter loss landscape with respect to model structure, enabling the discovery of pruning patterns that simultaneously optimize model compactness and robustness to input variations. Extensive experiments on CelebA-HQ, Flowers-102, and CIFAR-10-C across ResNet-18, GoogLeNet, and MobileNet-V2 show that C-SAM consistently achieves higher certified robustness than strong baselines, with improvements of up to 42%, while maintaining task accuracy comparable to the corresponding unpruned models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, we identify a systematic lack of emphasis on more challenging questions in existing methods from both algorithmic and data perspectives, despite their importance for refining underdeveloped capabilities. Algorithmically, widely used Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffers from an implicit imbalance where the magnitude of policy updates is lower for harder questions. Data-wise, augmentation approaches primarily rephrase questions to enhance diversity without systematically increasing intrinsic difficulty. To address these issues, we propose a two-dual MathForge framework to improve mathematical reasoning by targeting harder questions from both perspectives, which comprises a Difficulty-Aware Group Policy Optimization (DGPO) algorithm and a Multi-Aspect Question Reformulation (MQR) strategy. Specifically, DGPO first rectifies the implicit imbalance in GRPO via difficulty-balanced group advantage estimation, and further prioritizes harder questions by difficulty-aware question-level weighting. Meanwhile, MQR reformulates questions across multiple aspects to increase difficulty while maintaining the original gold answer. Overall, MathForge forms a synergistic loop: MQR expands the data frontier, and DGPO effectively learns from the augmented data.

An open question is whether samples from a shifted distribution can effectively support learning when combined with limited target domain data. We investigate this problem in the context of bladder segmentation in CT guided gynecological brachytherapy, a critical task for accurate dose optimization and organ at risk sparing. While CT scans without brachytherapy applicators (no applicator: NA) are widely available, scans with applicators inserted (with applicator: WA) are scarce and exhibit substantial anatomical deformation and imaging artifacts, making automated segmentation particularly difficult.\n  We propose a dual domain learning strategy that integrates NA and WA CT data to improve robustness and generalizability under covariate shift. Using a curated assorted dataset, we show that NA data alone fail to capture the anatomical and artifact related characteristics of WA images. However, introducing a modest proportion of WA data into a predominantly NA training set leads to significant performance improvements. Through systematic experiments across axial, coronal, and sagittal planes using multiple deep learning architectures, we demonstrate that doping only 10 to 30 percent WA data achieves segmentation performance comparable to models trained exclusively on WA data.\n  The proposed approach attains Dice similarity coefficients of up to 0.94 and Intersection over Union scores of up to 0.92, indicating effective domain adaptation and improved clinical reliability.

To investigate these aspects, we use a referential-game framework in which vision-language model (VLM) agents communicate, providing a controlled, measurable setting for evaluating language variants. Experiments show that VLMs can develop effective, task-adapted communication patterns. At the same time, they can develop covert protocols that are difficult for humans and external agents to interpret.

Only visits with observable 180-day outcomes were labeled; right-censored cases were excluded from analysis. We compared five candidate architectures: Long Short-Term Memory, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Cox Proportional Hazards, Random Survival Forest (RSF), and Logistic Regression. For each dataset, we selected the smallest risk-threshold that achieved an 85% sensitivity floor. The GRU and RSF models showed high discrimination capabilities initially (C-index: 87% for both). In external validation, the GRU obtained a higher calibration (slope: 0.93; intercept: 0.07) and achieved an PR-AUC of 0.87. Clinical impact analysis showed a median time-in-warning of 151.0 days for true positives (59.0 days for false positives) and 18.3 alerts per 100 patient-visits.

From a single RGB image, we recover object-centric three-dimensional geometry via monocular depth estimation to inform volume and extract coarse material semantics using a vision-language model to guide density-related reasoning. These geometry, semantic, and appearance representations are fused through an instance-adaptive gating mechanism, and two physically guided latent factors (volume- and density-related) are predicted through separate regression heads under mass-only supervision.

However, overdose of ICM can cause problems such as kidney damage and life-threatening allergic reactions. Deep learning methods can generate CT images of normal-dose ICM from low-dose ICM, reducing the required dose while maintaining diagnostic power. However, existing methods are difficult to realize accurate enhancement with incompletely paired images, mainly because of the limited ability of the model to recognize specific structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Structure-constrained Language-informed Diffusion Model (SLDM), a unified medical generation model that integrates structural synergy and spatial intelligence. First, the structural prior information of the image is effectively extracted to constrain the model inference process, thus ensuring structural consistency in the enhancement process.

Finally, the subtraction angiography enhancement module is applied, which serves to improve the contrast of the ICM agent region to suitable interval for observation.

Existing methods typically rely on degradation priors to guide restoration, yet often struggle to reconstruct content in severely degraded regions. Although recent works leverage semantic information to facilitate content generation, integrating it into the shallow layers of diffusion models often disrupts spatial structures (\\emph{e.g.}, blurring artifacts). To address this issue, we propose a Triple-Prior Guided Diffusion (TPGDiff) network for unified image restoration. TPGDiff incorporates degradation priors throughout the diffusion trajectory, while introducing structural priors into shallow layers and semantic priors into deep layers, enabling hierarchical and complementary prior guidance for image reconstruction. Specifically, we leverage multi-source structural cues as structural priors to capture fine-grained details and guide shallow layers representations. To complement this design, we further develop a distillation-driven semantic extractor that yields robust semantic priors, ensuring reliable high-level guidance at deep layers even under severe degradations. Furthermore, a degradation extractor is employed to learn degradation-aware priors, enabling stage-adaptive control of the diffusion process across all timesteps. Extensive experiments on both single- and multi-degradation benchmarks demonstrate that TPGDiff achieves superior performance and generalization across diverse restoration scenarios.

Code will be released upon publication", "summary": "Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated exceptional success in video super-resolution (VSR), showcasing a powerful capacity for generating fine-grained details. However, their potential for space-time video super-resolution (STVSR), which necessitates not only recovering realistic visual content from low-resolution to high-resolution but also improving the frame rate with coherent temporal dynamics, remains largely underexplored. Moreover, existing STVSR methods predominantly address spatiotemporal upsampling under simplified degradation assumptions, which often struggle in real-world scenarios with complex unknown degradations. Such a high demand for reconstruction fidelity and temporal consistency makes the development of a robust STVSR framework particularly non-trivial. To address these challenges, we propose OSDEnhancer, a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, represents the first method to achieve real-world STVSR through an efficient one-step diffusion process. OSDEnhancer initializes essential spatiotemporal structures through a linear pre-interpolation strategy and pivots on training temporal refinement and spatial enhancement mixture of experts (TR-SE MoE), which allows distinct expert pathways to progressively learn robust, specialized representations for temporal coherence and spatial detail, further collaboratively reinforcing each other during inference. A bidirectional deformable variational autoencoder (VAE) decoder is further introduced to perform recurrent spatiotemporal aggregation and propagation, enhancing cross-frame reconstruction fidelity.

Inspired by this, we explore training an autoregressive transformer for in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL). In this setting, we initially train a transformer on an offline dataset consisting of trajectories collected from various RL tasks, and then fix and use this transformer to create an action policy for new RL tasks. Notably, we consider the setting where the offline dataset contains trajectories sampled from suboptimal behavioral policies. In this case, standard autoregressive training corresponds to imitation learning and results in suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose the Decision Importance Transformer(DIT) framework, which emulates the actor-critic algorithm in an in-context manner. In particular, we first train a transformer-based value function that estimates the advantage functions of the behavior policies that collected the suboptimal trajectories.

Prior methods improve surface reconstruction by refining Gaussian depth estimates, either via multi-view geometric consistency or through monocular depth priors. However, multi-view constraints become unreliable under large geometric discrepancies, while monocular priors suffer from scale ambiguity and local inconsistency, ultimately leading to inaccurate Gaussian depth supervision. To address these limitations, we introduce a Gaussian visibility-aware multi-view geometric consistency constraint that aggregates the visibility of shared Gaussian primitives across views, enabling more accurate and stable geometric supervision. In addition, we propose a progressive quadtree-calibrated Monocular depth constraint that performs block-wise affine calibration from coarse to fine spatial scales, mitigating the scale ambiguity of depth priors while preserving fine-grained surface details. Extensive experiments on DTU and TNT datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in geometric accuracy over prior Gaussian-based and implicit surface reconstruction methods.

The model provides two built-in inference methods: maximum a posteriori estimation using the L-BFGS-B algorithm, and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling via the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS). While exploring various time-series forecasting problems using Bayesian inference with Prophet, we encountered limitations stemming from the inability to apply alternative inference techniques beyond those provided by default. Additionally, the fluent API design of Facebook Prophet proved insufficiently flexible for implementing our custom modeling ideas. To address these shortcomings, we developed a complete reimplementation of the Prophet model in PyMC, which enables us to extend the base model and evaluate and compare multiple Bayesian inference methods. In this paper, we present our PyMC-based implementation and analyze in detail the implementation of different Bayesian inference techniques. We consider full MCMC techniques, MAP estimation and Variational inference techniques on a time-series forecasting problem.

Yet their susceptibility to privacy leakage via Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) remains critically underexplored. This paper presents the first systematic investigation of MIA vulnerabilities in DLMs. Unlike the autoregressive models' single fixed prediction pattern, DLMs' multiple maskable configurations exponentially increase attack opportunities. This ability to probe many independent masks dramatically improves detection chances. To exploit this, we introduce SAMA (Subset-Aggregated Membership Attack), which addresses the sparse signal challenge through robust aggregation. SAMA samples masked subsets across progressive densities and applies sign-based statistics that remain effective despite heavy-tailed noise. Through inverse-weighted aggregation prioritizing sparse masks' cleaner signals, SAMA transforms sparse memorization detection into a robust voting mechanism.

These critical aspects are largely overlooked by current benchmarks due to their short or information-sparse prompt design. In this paper, we introduce SpatialGenEval, a new benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the spatial intelligence of T2I models, covering two key aspects: (1) SpatialGenEval involves 1,230 long, information-dense prompts across 25 real-world scenes. Each prompt integrates 10 spatial sub-domains and corresponding 10 multi-choice question-answer pairs, ranging from object position and layout to occlusion and causality. Our extensive evaluation of 21 state-of-the-art models reveals that higher-order spatial reasoning remains a primary bottleneck. (2) To demonstrate that the utility of our information-dense design goes beyond simple evaluation, we also construct the SpatialT2I dataset. It contains 15,400 text-image pairs with rewritten prompts to ensure image consistency while preserving information density. Fine-tuned results on current foundation models (i.e., Stable Diffusion-XL, Uniworld-V1, OmniGen2) yield consistent performance gains (+4.2%, +5.7%, +4.4%) and more realistic effects in spatial relations, highlighting a data-centric paradigm to achieve spatial intelligence in T2I models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Despite notable progress, existing learning-based methods typically treat this task as a direct regression objective and struggle with detail inconsistency and color deviation, due to the ill-posed nature of inverse ISP and the inherent information loss in quantized RGB images. To address these limitations, we pioneer a generative perspective by reformulating RGB-to-RAW reconstruction as a deterministic latent transport problem and introduce a novel framework named RAW-Flow, which leverages flow matching to learn a deterministic vector field in latent space, to effectively bridge the gap between RGB and RAW representations and enable accurate reconstruction of structural details and color information. To further enhance latent transport, we introduce a cross-scale context guidance module that injects hierarchical RGB features into the flow estimation process. Moreover, we design a dual-domain latent autoencoder with a feature alignment constraint to support the proposed latent transport framework, which jointly encodes RGB and RAW inputs while promoting stable training and high-fidelity reconstruction.

We propose much simpler techniques for assessing implicit planning in language models. With case studies on rhyme poetry generation and question answering, we demonstrate that our methodology easily scales to many models. Across models, we find that the generated rhyme (e.g. \"-ight\") or answer to a question (\"whale\") can be manipulated by steering at the end of the preceding line with a vector, affecting the generation of intermediate tokens leading up to the rhyme or answer word. We show that implicit planning is a universal mechanism, present in smaller models than previously thought, starting from 1B parameters.

However, this process lacks theoretical justification. This paper fills the gap by developing a local duality theory for such an SSVM formulation and exploring its relationship with the hinge-loss SVM (hSVM) and the ramp-loss SVM (rSVM). In particular, we prove that the derived SSVM is exactly the dual problem of the 0/1-loss SVM, and the linear representer theorem holds for their local solutions. The local solution of SSVM also provides guidelines on selecting hyperparameters of hSVM and rSVM. {Under specific conditions, we show that a sequence of global solutions of hSVM converges to a local solution of 0/1-loss SVM. Moreover, a local minimizer of 0/1-loss SVM is a local minimizer of rSVM.} This explains why a local solution induced by SSVM outperforms hSVM and rSVM in the prior empirical study.

Despite progress in performance, existing offline methods that generate fixed-length motions with a fixed number of agents, are inherently limited in handling long or variable text, and varying agent counts. These limitations naturally encourage autoregressive formulations, which predict future motions step by step conditioned on all past trajectories and current text guidance. In this work, we introduce HINT, the first autoregressive framework for multi-human motion generation with Hierarchical INTeraction modeling in diffusion. First, HINT leverages a disentangled motion representation within a canonicalized latent space, decoupling local motion semantics from inter-person interactions. This design facilitates direct adaptation to varying numbers of human participants without requiring additional refinement. Second, HINT adopts a sliding-window strategy for efficient online generation, and aggregates local within-window and global cross-window conditions to capture past human history, inter-person dependencies, and align with text guidance. This strategy not only enables fine-grained interaction modeling within each window but also preserves long-horizon coherence across all the long sequence.

Such techniques usually involve solving large, sparse linear systems, where preconditioning methods are critical. In recent years, neural methods, particularly graph neural networks (GNNs), have demonstrated their potential through accelerated convergence. Nonetheless, to extract connective structures, existing techniques aggregate discretized system matrices into graphs, and suffer from rank inflation and a suboptimal convergence rate. In this paper, we articulate NeuraLSP, a novel neural preconditioner combined with a novel loss metric that leverages the left singular subspace of the system matrix's near-nullspace vectors. By compressing spectral information into a fixed low-rank operator, our method exhibits both theoretical guarantees and empirical robustness to rank inflation, affording up to a 53% speedup. Besides the theoretical guarantees for our newly-formulated loss function, our comprehensive experimental results across diverse families of PDEs also substantiate the aforementioned theoretical advances.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This structured pipeline ensures guaranteed symmetry, coherent part placement, and diverse, high-quality outputs. By disentangling the generative process into interpretable components, our method supports fine-grained control over shape attributes, enabling targeted manipulation of individual parts while preserving global consistency.

The architecture employs a native Vision Transformer (ViT) featuring a dynamic-resolution visual encoder to extract shared document features, coupled with a prompt-guided Youtu-LLM-2B language model for layout analysis and region-prompted decoding. Leveraging this decoupled and feature-reusable framework, we introduce a high-parallelism decoding strategy comprising two core components: token parallelism and query parallelism. The token parallelism strategy concurrently generates up to 64 candidate tokens per inference step, which are subsequently validated through a verification mechanism. This approach yields a 5--11x speedup over traditional autoregressive decoding and is particularly well-suited for highly structured scenarios, such as table recognition. To further exploit the advantages of region-prompted decoding, the query parallelism strategy enables simultaneous content prediction for multiple bounding boxes (up to five), providing an additional 2x acceleration while maintaining output quality equivalent to standard decoding. Youtu-Parsing encompasses a diverse range of document elements, including text, formulas, tables, charts, seals, and hierarchical structures.

However, existing deepfake detectors often generalize poorly to images produced by unseen generators. Notably, despite being trained under vastly different paradigms, such as diffusion or autoregressive modeling, many modern image generators share common final architectural components that serve as the last stage for converting intermediate representations into images. Motivated by this insight, we propose to \"contaminate\" real images using the generator's final component and train a detector to distinguish them from the original real images. We further introduce a taxonomy based on generators' final components and categorize 21 widely used generators accordingly, enabling a comprehensive investigation of our method's generalization capability.

Such methods aim to maximize a conditional output distribution aligned with higher rewards whilst not drifting far from a pretrained prior. This is commonly enforced by KL (Kullback Leibler) regularization. As such, a central issue still remains: how does one choose the right regularization strength? Too high of a strength leads to limited alignment and too low of a strength leads to \"reward hacking\". This renders the task of choosing the correct regularization strength highly non-trivial. Existing approaches sweep over this hyperparameter by aligning a pretrained model at multiple regularization strengths and then choose the best strength. Unfortunately, this is prohibitively expensive. We introduce DeRaDiff, a denoising time realignment procedure that, after aligning a pretrained model once, modulates the regularization strength during sampling to emulate models trained at other regularization strengths without any additional training or finetuning. Extending decoding-time realignment from language to diffusion models, DeRaDiff operates over iterative predictions of continuous latents by replacing the reverse step reference distribution by a geometric mixture of an aligned and reference posterior, thus giving rise to a closed form update under common schedulers and a single tunable parameter, lambda, for on the fly control.

In this work, we identify that the multi-head self-attention in these models under-utilizes historical frames: approximately 25% heads attend almost exclusively to the current frame, and discarding their KV caches incurs only minor performance degradation. Building upon this, we propose Dummy Forcing, a simple yet effective method to control context accessibility across different heads. Specifically, the proposed heterogeneous memory allocation reduces head-wise context redundancy, accompanied by dynamic head programming to adaptively classify head types. Moreover, we develop a context packing technique to achieve more aggressive cache compression. Without additional training, our Dummy Forcing delivers up to 2.0x speedup over the baseline, supporting video generation at 24.3 FPS with less than 0.5% quality drop.

To make HP selection cheap and reliable, we propose a new parameterization for transformer models with MoE layers when scaling model width, depth, number of experts, and expert (hidden) size. Our parameterization is justified by a novel dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) analysis. When varying different model dimensions trained at a fixed token budget, we find empirically that our parameterization enables reliable HP transfer across models from 51M to over 2B total parameters.

Recently, deep generative models offer powerful data-driven priors for such inverse problems, yet existing methods struggle to enforce hard physical constraints without costly retraining or disrupting the learned generative prior. Consequently, there is a critical need for a sampling mechanism that can reconcile strict physical consistency and observational fidelity with the statistical structure of the pre-trained prior. To this end, we present ProFlow, a proximal guidance framework for zero-shot physics-consistent sampling, defined as inferring solutions from sparse observations using a fixed generative prior without task-specific retraining. The algorithm employs a rigorous two-step scheme that alternates between: (\\romannumeral1) a terminal optimization step, which projects the flow prediction onto the intersection of the physically and observationally consistent sets via proximal minimization; and (\\romannumeral2) an interpolation step, which maps the refined state back to the generative trajectory to maintain consistency with the learned flow probability path. This procedure admits a Bayesian interpretation as a sequence of local maximum a posteriori (MAP) updates. Comprehensive benchmarks on Poisson, Helmholtz, Darcy, and viscous Burgers' equations demonstrate that ProFlow achieves superior physical and observational consistency, as well as more accurate distributional statistics, compared to state-of-the-art diffusion- and flow-based baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "ProFlow\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u8fd1\u7aef\u5f15\u5bfc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u7269\u7406\u573a\u89e3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e25\u683c\u6ee1\u8db3\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6df1\u5ea6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u7406\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u4f9b\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u7834\u574f\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u6216\u8fdb\u884c\u6602\u8d35\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u786c\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u91c7\u6837\u673a\u5236\u6765\u534f\u8c03\u4e25\u683c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u89c2\u6d4b\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faProFlow\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u4e24\u6b65\u65b9\u6848\uff1a1)\u7ec8\u7aef\u4f18\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd1\u7aef\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5c06\u6d41\u9884\u6d4b\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u96c6\u5408\u7684\u4ea4\u96c6\u4e0a\uff1b2)\u63d2\u503c\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u5c06\u7cbe\u70bc\u72b6\u6001\u6620\u5c04\u56de\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u6d41\u6982\u7387\u8def\u5f84\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u5927\u540e\u9a8c\u66f4\u65b0\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6cca\u677e\u65b9\u7a0b\u3001\u4ea5\u59c6\u970d\u5179\u65b9\u7a0b\u3001\u8fbe\u897f\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u7c98\u6027\u4f2f\u683c\u65af\u65b9\u7a0b\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6269\u6563\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u6d41\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cProFlow\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u7edf\u8ba1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "ProFlow\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u89c2\u6d4b\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u7269\u7406\u573a\u89e3\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e25\u683c\u6ee1\u8db3\u504f\u5fae\u5206\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u7269\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5728\u534f\u8c03\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u786c\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

The identity shows that for globally calibrated models, the weighted sums of miscalibration within groups and error imbalance across groups is equal to a \"total unfairness budget.\" For binary outcomes, this budget is the model's mean-squared error times the difference in group prevalence across outcome classes. The identity nests standard impossibility results as special cases, while also describing inherent tradeoffs when one or more fairness measures are not perfectly satisfied. The results suggest that accuracy and fairness are best viewed as complements in binary prediction tasks: increasing accuracy necessarily shrinks the total unfairness budget and vice-versa. Experiments on benchmark data confirm the theory and show that many fairness interventions largely substitute between fairness violations, and when they reduce accuracy they tend to expand the total unfairness budget.

However, the application of cache mechanisms often introduces undesirable repetitive text generation, a phenomenon we term the \\textbf{Repeat Curse}. To better investigate underlying mechanism behind this issue, we analyze repetition generation through the lens of information flow. Our work reveals three key findings: (1) context tokens aggregate semantic information as anchors and guide the final predictions; (2) as information propagates across layers, the entropy of context tokens converges in deeper layers, reflecting the model's growing prediction certainty; (3) Repetition is typically linked to disruptions in the information flow of context tokens and to the inability of their entropy to converge in deeper layers. Based on these insights, we present \\textbf{CoTA}, a plug-and-play method for mitigating repetition. CoTA enhances the attention of context tokens to preserve intrinsic information flow patterns, while introducing a penalty term to the confidence score during decoding to avoid outputs driven by uncertain context tokens. With extensive experiments, CoTA demonstrates significant effectiveness in alleviating repetition and achieves consistent performance improvements on general tasks.

While recent approaches leverage vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, to transfer high-level concept knowledge, methods based on purely vision foundation models (VFMs), like DINOv2, have lagged behind in performance. We argue that this gap stems from two practical issues: (i) limited diversity in existing auxiliary anomaly detection datasets and (ii) overly shallow VFM adaptation strategies. To address both challenges, we propose AnomalyVFM, a general and effective framework that turns any pretrained VFM into a strong zero-shot anomaly detector. Our approach combines a robust three-stage synthetic dataset generation scheme with a parameter-efficient adaptation mechanism, utilising low-rank feature adapters and a confidence-weighted pixel loss. Together, these components enable modern VFMs to substantially outperform current state-of-the-art methods. More specifically, with RADIO as a backbone, AnomalyVFM achieves an average image-level AUROC of 94.1% across 9 diverse datasets, surpassing previous methods by significant 3.3 percentage points.

Previous Parameter-Efficient-Tuning (PET) methods regard the pre-trained model as an opaque Black Box model, relying purely on data-driven optimization and underutilizing their inherent prior knowledge.

To address these issues, we propose a novel black-whIte bOx prompT leArning framework (IOTA), which integrates a data-driven Black Box module with a knowledge-driven White Box module for downstream task adaptation. Specifically, the White Box module derives corrective knowledge by contrasting the wrong predictions with the right cognition. This knowledge is verbalized into interpretable human prompts and leveraged through a corrective knowledge-guided prompt selection strategy to guide the Black Box module toward more accurate predictions. By jointly leveraging knowledge- and data-driven learning signals, IOTA achieves effective downstream task adaptation.

When temporal ordering information is corrupted, missing, or deliberately hidden (e.g., for privacy), existing estimation methods often fail. In this paper, we investigate the conditions under which temporal order can be recovered and introduce a novel framework that simultaneously reconstructs temporal information and estimates SDE parameters. Our approach exploits asymmetries between forward and backward processes, deriving a score-matching criterion to infer the correct temporal order between pairs of observations. We then recover the total order via a sorting procedure and estimate SDE parameters from the reconstructed sequence using maximum likelihood.

We propose $\u03b4$-Adapter, a lightweight, architecture-agnostic way to boost deployed time series forecasters without retraining. $\u03b4$-Adapter learns tiny, bounded modules at two interfaces: input nudging (soft edits to covariates) and output residual correction. We provide local descent guarantees, $O(\u03b4)$ drift bounds, and compositional stability for combined adapters. Meanwhile, it can act as a feature selector by learning a sparse, horizon-aware mask over inputs to select important features, thereby improving interpretability. In addition, it can also be used as a distribution calibrator to measure uncertainty. Thus, we introduce a Quantile Calibrator and a Conformal Corrector that together deliver calibrated, personalized intervals with finite-sample coverage.

Inspired by this cognitive mechanism, DeepEncoder V2 is designed to endow the encoder with causal reasoning capabilities, enabling it to intelligently reorder visual tokens prior to LLM-based content interpretation. This work explores a novel paradigm: whether 2D image understanding can be effectively achieved through two-cascaded 1D causal reasoning structures, thereby offering a new architectural approach with the potential to achieve genuine 2D reasoning.

We demonstrate the performance on rotating detonation engines (RDEs), a challenging class of systems that couple detonation-front propagation with injector-driven unsteadiness, mixing, and stiff chemistry across disparate scales. Our approach successfully reconstructs high-fidelity RDE states from sparse measurements while isolating physically meaningful discrepancy dynamics associated with injector-driven effects.

In such cases, models are demonstrated to exploit evaluations built on such imperfect supervision, leading to deceptive results. However, underutilized in LLM research, a wealth of mechanism design research focuses on game-theoretic incentive compatibility, i.e., eliciting honest and informative answers with weak supervision. Drawing from this literature, we introduce the peer prediction method for model evaluation and post-training. It rewards honest and informative answers over deceptive and uninformative ones, using a metric based on mutual predictability and without requiring ground truth labels. We demonstrate the method's effectiveness and resistance to deception, with both theoretical guarantees and empirical validation on models with up to 405B parameters. We show that training an 8B model with peer prediction-based reward recovers most of the drop in truthfulness due to prior malicious finetuning, even when the reward is produced by a 0.135B language model with no finetuning. On the evaluation front, in contrast to LLM-as-a-Judge which requires strong and trusted judges, we discover an inverse scaling property in peer prediction, where, surprisingly, resistance to deception is strengthened as the capability gap between the experts and participants widens, enabling reliable evaluation of strong models with weak supervision. In particular, LLM-as-a-Judge become worse than random guess when facing deceptive models 5-20x the judge's size, while peer prediction thrives when such gaps are large, including in cases with over 100x size difference.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A key challenge in CTVR is feature drift, which manifests in two forms: intra-modal feature drift caused by continual learning within each modality, and non-cooperative feature drift across modalities that leads to modality misalignment. To mitigate these issues, we propose StructAlign, a structured cross-modal alignment method for CTVR. First, StructAlign introduces a simplex Equiangular Tight Frame (ETF) geometry as a unified geometric prior to mitigate modality misalignment. Building upon this geometric prior, we design a cross-modal ETF alignment loss that aligns text and video features with category-level ETF prototypes, encouraging the learned representations to form an approximate simplex ETF geometry. In addition, to suppress intra-modal feature drift, we design a Cross-modal Relation Preserving loss, which leverages complementary modalities to preserve cross-modal similarity relations, providing stable relational supervision for feature updates. By jointly addressing non-cooperative feature drift across modalities and intra-modal feature drift, StructAlign effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting in CTVR.

In ophthalmic practice, fluorescein fundus angiography (FFA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) provide hemodynamic and lesion-structural information that conventional fundus photography cannot capture. However, due to the single-modality nature, subtle lesion patterns, and significant inter-device variability, existing methods still face limitations in generalization and high-confidence prediction. To address these challenges, we propose CLEAR-Mamba, an enhanced framework built upon MedMamba with optimizations in both architecture and training strategy. Architecturally, we introduce HaC, a hypernetwork-based adaptive conditioning layer that dynamically generates parameters according to input feature distributions, thereby improving cross-domain adaptability. From a training perspective, we develop RaP, a reliability-aware prediction scheme built upon evidential uncertainty learning, which encourages the model to emphasize low-confidence samples and improves overall stability and reliability. We further construct a large-scale ophthalmic angiography dataset covering both FFA and ICGA modalities, comprising multiple retinal disease categories for model training and evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that CLEAR-Mamba consistently outperforms multiple baseline models, including the original MedMamba, across various metrics-showing particular advantages in multi-disease classification and reliability-aware prediction.

This study investigates the memory mechanisms instantiated by attention layers, drawing on prior research in psychology and computational psycholinguistics that links Transformer attention to cue based retrieval in human memory. In this view, queries encode the retrieval context, keys index candidate memory traces, attention weights quantify cue trace similarity, and values carry the encoded content, jointly enabling the construction of a context representation that precedes and facilitates memory retrieval. Guided by the Encoding Specificity Principle, we hypothesize that the cues used in the initial stage of retrieval are instantiated as keywords. We provide converging evidence for this keywords-as-cues hypothesis.

Utilizing ultrasound transducers with larger surface areas can improve detection sensitivity. However, when computationally efficient analytic reconstruction methods that neglect the spatial impulse responses (SIRs) of the transducer are employed, the spatial resolution of the reconstructed images will be compromised. Although optimization-based reconstruction methods can explicitly account for SIR effects, their computational cost is generally high, particularly in three-dimensional (3D) applications. To address the need for accurate but rapid 3D PACT image reconstruction, this study presents a framework for establishing a learned SIR compensation method that operates in the data domain. The learned compensation method maps SIR-corrupted PACT measurement data to compensated data that would have been recorded by idealized point-like transducers. Subsequently, the compensated data can be used with a computationally efficient reconstruction method that neglects SIR effects. Two variants of the learned compensation model are investigated that employ a U-Net model and a specifically designed, physics-inspired model, referred to as Deconv-Net. A fast and analytical training data generation procedure is also a component of the presented framework. The framework is rigorously validated in virtual imaging studies, demonstrating resolution improvement and robustness to noise variations, object complexity, and sound speed heterogeneity. When applied to in-vivo breast imaging data, the learned compensation models revealed fine structures that had been obscured by SIR-induced artifacts. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of learned SIR compensation in 3D PACT imaging.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

These tasks are often tedious for humans since they can extend to extreme lengths proportional to the size of the data to process. However, they are ideal for Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) due to their structured, recurring sub-workflows with logic that can be systematically learned. Identifying the absence of an evaluation benchmark as a primary bottleneck, we establish OS-Marathon, comprising 242 long-horizon, repetitive tasks across 2 domains to evaluate state-of-the-art (SOTA) agents. We then introduce a cost-effective method to construct a condensed demonstration using only few-shot examples to teach agents the underlying workflow logic, enabling them to execute similar workflows effectively on larger, unseen data collections. Extensive experiments demonstrate both the inherent challenges of these tasks and the effectiveness of our proposed method.

We study this question using completed Sudoku grids as a controlled testbed, treating them as a subset of a continuous relaxation space. We train flow-matching and score-based models along a Gaussian probability path and compare deterministic (ODE) sampling, stochastic (SDE) sampling, and DDPM-style discretizations derived from the same continuous-time training. Unconditionally, stochastic sampling substantially outperforms deterministic flows; score-based samplers are the most reliable among continuous-time methods, and DDPM-style ancestral sampling achieves the highest validity overall. We further show that the same models can be repurposed for guided generation: by repeatedly sampling completions under clamped clues and stopping when constraints are satisfied, the model acts as a probabilistic Sudoku solver. Although far less sample-efficient than classical solvers and discrete-geometry-aware diffusion methods, these experiments demonstrate that classic diffusion/flow formulations can assign non-zero probability mass to globally constrained combinatorial structures and can be used for constraint satisfaction via stochastic search.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, such data often contains numerous low-quality samples, necessitating effective data processing (DP). In practice, DP strategies are typically developed through iterative manual analysis and trial-and-error adjustment. These processes inevitably incur high labor costs and may lead to privacy issues in high-privacy domains like healthcare due to direct human access to sensitive data. Thus, achieving automated data processing without exposing the raw data has become a critical challenge. To address this challenge, we propose LLM-AutoDP, a novel framework that leverages LLMs as agents to automatically generate and optimize data processing strategies. Our method generates multiple candidate strategies and iteratively refines them using feedback signals and comparative evaluations. This iterative in-context learning mechanism enables the agent to converge toward high-quality processing pipelines without requiring direct human intervention or access to the underlying data. To further accelerate strategy search, we introduce three key techniques: Distribution Preserving Sampling, which reduces data volume while maintaining distributional integrity; Processing Target Selection, which uses a binary classifier to identify low-quality samples for focused processing; Cache-and-Reuse Mechanism}, which minimizes redundant computations by reusing prior processing results. Results show that models trained on data processed by our framework achieve over 80% win rates against models trained on unprocessed data. Compared to AutoML baselines based on LLM agents, LLM-AutoDP achieves approximately a 65% win rate. Moreover, our acceleration techniques reduce the total searching time by up to 10 times, demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Current research on skill assessment has predominantly focused on sports and lacks large-scale datasets for complex procedural activities. Existing studies typically involve only a limited number of actions, focus on either pairwise assessments (e.g., A is better than B) or on binary labels (e.g., good execution vs needs improvement). In response to these shortcomings, we introduce ProSkill, the first benchmark dataset for action-level skill assessment in procedural tasks. ProSkill provides absolute skill assessment annotations, along with pairwise ones. This is enabled by a novel and scalable annotation protocol that allows for the creation of an absolute skill assessment ranking starting from pairwise assessments. This protocol leverages a Swiss Tournament scheme for efficient pairwise comparisons, which are then aggregated into consistent, continuous global scores using an ELO-based rating system. We use our dataset to benchmark the main state-of-the-art skill assessment algorithms, including both ranking-based and pairwise paradigms. The suboptimal results achieved by the current state-of-the-art highlight the challenges and thus the value of ProSkill in the context of skill assessment for procedural videos.

This is the camera-ready version. Please refer to the published version for citation once available", "summary": "The prediction objectives of online advertisement ranking models are evolving from probabilistic metrics like conversion rate (CVR) to numerical business metrics like post-click gross merchandise volume (GMV). Unlike the well-studied delayed feedback problem in CVR prediction, delayed feedback modeling for GMV prediction remains unexplored and poses greater challenges, as GMV is a continuous target, and a single click can lead to multiple purchases that cumulatively form the label. To bridge the research gap, we establish TRACE, a GMV prediction benchmark containing complete transaction sequences rising from each user click, which supports delayed feedback modeling in an online streaming manner. Our analysis and exploratory experiments on TRACE reveal two key insights: (1) the rapid evolution of the GMV label distribution necessitates modeling delayed feedback under online streaming training; (2) the label distribution of repurchase samples substantially differs from that of single-purchase samples, highlighting the need for separate modeling. Motivated by these findings, we propose RepurchasE-Aware Dual-branch prEdictoR (READER), a novel GMV modeling paradigm that selectively activates expert parameters according to repurchase predictions produced by a router. Moreover, READER dynamically calibrates the regression target to mitigate under-estimation caused by incomplete labels. Experimental results show that READER yields superior performance on TRACE over baselines, achieving a 2.19% improvement in terms of accuracy. We believe that our study will open up a new avenue for studying online delayed feedback modeling for GMV prediction, and our TRACE benchmark with the gathered insights will facilitate future research and application in this promising direction.

While PL has demonstrated strong generalization on natural image datasets, its transferability to remote sensing (RS) imagery remains underexplored. RS data present unique challenges, including multi-label scenes, high intra-class variability, and diverse spatial resolutions, that hinder the direct applicability of existing PL methods. In particular, current prompt-based approaches often struggle to identify dominant semantic cues and fail to generalize to novel classes in RS scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose BiMoRS, a lightweight bi-modal prompt learning framework tailored for RS tasks. BiMoRS employs a frozen image captioning model (e.g., BLIP-2) to extract textual semantic summaries from RS images. These captions are tokenized using a BERT tokenizer and fused with high-level visual features from the CLIP encoder. A lightweight cross-attention module then conditions a learnable query prompt on the fused textual-visual representation, yielding contextualized prompts without altering the CLIP backbone. We evaluate BiMoRS on four RS datasets across three domain generalization (DG) tasks and observe consistent performance gains, outperforming strong baselines by up to 2% on average.

Block-wise diffusion can reduce this cost, yet it typically relies on retraining and constrained update orders, limiting its direct applicability to pretrained DLMs. Our token-level analysis reveals pronounced structural locality in DLM inference. Decoding is driven by a small set of prefix-localized active tokens; the influence of distant undecoded context diminishes rapidly, and decoded tokens exhibit stage-wise temporal stability, enabling reuse of intermediate representations except for a brief post-decode transient.

Computation is restricted to active and buffer tokens within the window, while far-field tokens are omitted at each stage.

We argue that for MLLM-based IQA, the core bottleneck lies not in the quality perception capacity of MLLMs, but in MOS scale calibration. Therefore, we propose LEAF, a Label-Efficient Image Quality Assessment Framework that distills perceptual quality priors from an MLLM teacher into a lightweight student regressor, enabling MOS calibration with minimal human supervision. Specifically, the teacher conducts dense supervision through point-wise judgments and pair-wise preferences, with an estimate of decision reliability.

Among the various XAI techniques, counterfactual explanations (CFs) hold a pivotal role due to their ability to illustrate how changes in input features can alter an ML model's decision, thereby offering actionable recourse to users. Ensuring that individuals with comparable attributes and those belonging to different protected groups (e.g., demographic) receive similar and actionable recourse options is essential for trustworthy and fair decision-making. In this work, we address this challenge directly by focusing on the generation of fair CFs. Specifically, we start by defining and formulating fairness at: 1) individual fairness, ensuring that similar individuals receive similar CFs, 2) group fairness, ensuring equitable CFs across different protected groups and 3) hybrid fairness, which accounts for both individual and broader group-level fairness. We formulate the problem as an optimization task and propose a novel model-agnostic, reinforcement learning based approach to generate CFs that satisfy fairness constraints at both the individual and group levels, two objectives that are usually treated as orthogonal. As fairness metrics, we extend existing metrics commonly used for auditing ML models, such as equal choice of recourse and equal effectiveness across individuals and groups. We evaluate our approach on three benchmark datasets, showing that it effectively ensures individual and group fairness while preserving the quality of the generated CFs in terms of proximity and plausibility, and quantify the cost of fairness in the different levels separately. Our work opens a broader discussion on hybrid fairness and its role and implications for XAI and beyond CFs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u65e2\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e2a\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u53c8\u6ee1\u8db3\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff08CFs\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08XAI\uff09\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u56e0\u5176\u80fd\u5c55\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u6539\u53d8\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u51b3\u7b56\u800c\u5177\u6709\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u786e\u4fdd\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u7fa4\u4f53\u83b7\u5f97\u76f8\u4f3c\u4e14\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u5bf9\u4e8e\u53ef\u4fe1\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u5148\u5b9a\u4e49\u5e76\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff1a\u4e2a\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff08\u786e\u4fdd\u76f8\u4f3c\u4e2a\u4f53\u83b7\u5f97\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684CFs\uff09\u3001\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff08\u786e\u4fdd\u4e0d\u540c\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u7fa4\u4f53\u83b7\u5f97\u516c\u5e73\u7684CFs\uff09\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff08\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u4e2a\u4f53\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff09\u3002\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u4e2a\u4f53\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684CFs\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u786e\u4fdd\u4e2a\u4f53\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u751f\u6210CFs\u5728\u90bb\u8fd1\u6027\u548c\u5408\u7406\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u522b\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u9762\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u5f00\u542f\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u6df7\u5408\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5728XAI\u53ca\u8d85\u8d8aCFs\u9886\u57df\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u548c\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u4e2d\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u53ef\u4fe1\u548c\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

Motivated by these findings, we propose Test-time Adaptive Batched Ensemble Drafting (TABED), which dynamically ensembles multiple drafts obtained via batch inference by leveraging deviations from past ground truths available in the SD setting. The dynamic ensemble method achieves an average robust walltime speedup of 1.74x over autoregressive decoding and a 5% improvement over single drafting methods, while remaining training-free and keeping ensembling costs negligible through parameter sharing.

To bridge this gap, we introduce LEMON, a Lecture-based Evaluation benchmark for MultimOdal uNderstanding, focusing on STEM lecture videos that require long-horizon reasoning and cross-modal integration. LEMON comprises 2,277 video segments spanning 5 disciplines and 29 courses, with an average duration of 196.1 seconds, yielding 4,181 high-quality QA pairs, including 3,413 multiple-choice and 768 open-ended questions. Distinct from existing video benchmarks, LEMON features: (1) semantic richness and disciplinary density, (2) tightly coupled video-audio-text modalities, (3) explicit temporal and pedagogical structure, and (4) contextually linked multi-turn questioning.

However, standard space--time PINNs take time as an input but reuse a single network with shared weights across all times, forcing the same features to represent markedly different dynamics. This coupling degrades accuracy and can destabilize training when enforcing PDE, boundary, and initial constraints jointly. We propose Time-Induced Neural Networks (TINNs), a novel architecture that parameterizes the network weights as a learned function of time, allowing the effective spatial representation to evolve over time while maintaining shared structure. The resulting formulation naturally yields a nonlinear least-squares problem, which we optimize efficiently using a Levenberg--Marquardt method.

Modular pipelines restrict information flow and can amplify upstream errors. Recent query-based, fully differentiable perception-and-prediction (PnP) models mitigate these issues, yet the complementarity of cameras and LiDAR in the query-space has not been sufficiently explored. Models often rely on fusion schemes that introduce heuristic alignment and discrete selection steps which prevent full utilization of available information and can introduce unwanted bias. We propose Li-ViP3D++, a query-based multimodal PnP framework that introduces Query-Gated Deformable Fusion (QGDF) to integrate multi-view RGB and LiDAR in query space. QGDF (i) aggregates image evidence via masked attention across cameras and feature levels, (ii) extracts LiDAR context through fully differentiable BEV sampling with learned per-query offsets, and (iii) applies query-conditioned gating to adaptively weight visual and geometric cues per agent. The resulting architecture jointly optimizes detection, tracking, and multi-hypothesis trajectory forecasting in a single end-to-end model. On nuScenes, Li-ViP3D++ improves end-to-end behavior and detection quality, achieving higher EPA (0.335) and mAP (0.502) while substantially reducing false positives (FP ratio 0.147), and it is faster than the prior Li-ViP3D variant (139.82 ms vs. 145.91 ms).

For compression, classical visual coding based on traditional information theory has developed over decades, achieving great success with numerous international industrial standards widely applied in multimedia (e.g., image/video) systems. Except that, the recent emergingvisual token technology of generative multi-modal large models also shares a similar fundamental objective like visual coding: maximizing semantic information fidelity during the representation learning while minimizing computational cost. Therefore, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of two dominant technique families first -- Visual Coding and Vision Token Technology -- then we further unify them from the aspect of optimization, discussing the essence of compression efficiency and model performance trade-off behind. Next, based on the proposed unified formulation bridging visual coding andvisual token technology, we synthesize bidirectional insights of themselves and forecast the next-gen visual codec and token techniques. Last but not least, we experimentally show a large potential of the task-oriented token developments in the more practical tasks like multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), AI-generated content (AIGC), and embodied AI, as well as shedding light on the future possibility of standardizing a general token technology like the traditional codecs (e.g., H.264/265) with high efficiency for a wide range of intelligent tasks in a unified and effective manner.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u538b\u7f29\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u8868\u660e\u5176\u4e0eAI\u667a\u80fd\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u538b\u7f29\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9token\u6280\u672f\u672c\u8d28\u76f8\u901a\uff0c\u5747\u81f4\u529b\u4e8e\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u771f\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u4e8c\u8005\u878d\u5408\u5c06\u63a8\u52a8\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u89c6\u9891\u7f16\u7801\u548ctoken\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u89c6\u89c9\u538b\u7f29\u7f16\u7801\u6280\u672f\u4e0e\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u89c6\u89c9token\u6280\u672f\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3001AIGC\u7b49\u667a\u80fd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5728\u8054\u7cfb\u4e0e\u534f\u540c\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u671f\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u9ad8\u6548\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\u4e0e\u5e94\u7528\u542f\u793a\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\u89c6\u89c9\u538b\u7f29\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9token\u6280\u672f\u4e24\u5927\u6280\u672f\u4f53\u7cfb\uff1b\u5176\u6b21\uff0c\u4ece\u4f18\u5316\u89d2\u5ea6\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e8c\u8005\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u4e0a\u7684\u672c\u8d28\u5171\u6027\uff1b\u8fdb\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u53cc\u5411\u501f\u9274\u5e76\u5c55\u671b\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u4e0etoken\u6280\u672f\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5c55\u793a\u9762\u5411\u5177\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u4efb\u52a1\u7684token\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u9762\u5411\u4efb\u52a1\u7684token\u6280\u672f\u5728MLLMs\u3001AIGC\u3001\u5177\u8eabAI\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u51fa\u672a\u6765\u6709\u671b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4f20\u7edf\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u6807\u51c6\uff08\u5982H.264/265\uff09\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u901a\u7528token\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4ee5\u7edf\u4e00\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u652f\u6301\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u538b\u7f29\u7f16\u7801\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9token\u6280\u672f\u867d\u8d77\u6e90\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4f46\u4f18\u5316\u672c\u8d28\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u4e8c\u8005\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u4e0e\u878d\u5408\u5c06\u63a8\u52a8\u65b0\u4e00\u4ee3\u89c6\u89c9\u8868\u793a\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u667a\u80fd\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u901a\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u53ef\u80fd\u50ac\u751f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u901a\u7528token\u6280\u672f\u3002"}}

We first analyze demographic bias in T2V models and show that it primarily originates from pretrained text encoders, which encode implicit gender associations even for neutral prompts. We quantify this effect with a gender-leaning score that correlates with bias in generated videos.\n  Based on this insight, FairT2V mitigates demographic bias by neutralizing prompt embeddings via anchor-based spherical geodesic transformations while preserving semantics. To maintain temporal coherence, we apply debiasing only during early identity-forming steps through a dynamic denoising schedule.

While state-of-the-art gossip-based methods satisfy the first requirement, achieving robustness remains challenging. Asynchronous decentralized ADMM-based methods have been explored for estimating the median, a statistical centrality measure that is notoriously more robust than the mean. However, existing approaches require memory that scales with node degree, making them impractical when memory is limited. In this paper, we propose AsylADMM, a novel gossip algorithm for decentralized median and quantile estimation, primarily designed for asynchronous updates and requiring only two variables per node.

The key challenge involves reasoning about both the semantics of functional elements in 3D scenes and the 3D human poses required to achieve functionality-aware interaction. Unfortunately, existing methods typically lack explicit reasoning over object functionality and the corresponding human-scene contact, resulting in implausible or functionally incorrect interactions. In this work, we propose FunHSI, a training-free, functionality-driven framework that enables functionally correct human-scene interactions from open-vocabulary task prompts. Given a task prompt, FunHSI performs functionality-aware contact reasoning to identify functional scene elements, reconstruct their 3D geometry, and model high-level interactions via a contact graph. We then leverage vision-language models to synthesize a human performing the task in the image and estimate proposed 3D body and hand poses. Finally, the proposed 3D body configuration is refined via stage-wise optimization to ensure physical plausibility and functional correctness. In contrast to existing methods, FunHSI not only synthesizes more plausible general 3D interactions, such as \"sitting on a sofa'', while supporting fine-grained functional human-scene interactions, e.g., \"increasing the room temperature''. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FunHSI consistently generates functionally correct and physically plausible human-scene interactions across diverse indoor and outdoor scenes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This is driven by a ranking-aware verifiable reward that jointly assesses regression precision and ranking accuracy, facilitating direct model updates via policy optimization.

However, existing RSC techniques often fail to generalize beyond narrow operational conditions due to limited sensing modalities and datasets that lack environmental diversity. This work addresses these limitations by introducing a multimodal framework that fuses images and inertial measurements using a lightweight bidirectional cross-attention module followed by an adaptive gating layer that adjusts modality contributions under domain shifts. Given the limitations of current benchmarks, especially regarding lack of variability, we introduce ROAD, a new dataset composed of three complementary subsets: (i) real-world multimodal recordings with RGB-IMU streams synchronized using a gold-standard industry datalogger, captured across diverse lighting, weather, and surface conditions; (ii) a large vision-only subset designed to assess robustness under adverse illumination and heterogeneous capture setups; and (iii) a synthetic subset generated to study out-of-distribution generalization in scenarios difficult to obtain in practice. Experiments show that our method achieves a +1.4 pp improvement over the previous state-of-the-art on the PVS benchmark and an +11.6 pp improvement on our multimodal ROAD subset, with consistently higher F1-scores on minority classes. The framework also demonstrates stable performance across challenging visual conditions, including nighttime, heavy rain, and mixed-surface transitions. These findings indicate that combining affordable camera and IMU sensors with multimodal attention mechanisms provides a scalable, robust foundation for road surface understanding, particularly relevant for regions where environmental variability and cost constraints limit the adoption of high-end sensing suites.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u878d\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u60ef\u6027\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9053\u8def\u8868\u9762\u5206\u7c7b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53cc\u5411\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95e8\u63a7\u5c42\u6765\u5904\u7406\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u771f\u5b9e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u3001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6ROAD\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9053\u8def\u8868\u9762\u5206\u7c7b\u6280\u672f\u5728\u7a84\u64cd\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u73af\u5883\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5e94\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u548cIMU\u6570\u636e\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u53cc\u5411\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95e8\u63a7\u5c42\u6839\u636e\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u8c03\u6574\u6a21\u6001\u8d21\u732e\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u5b50\u96c6\u7684ROAD\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1a\u771f\u5b9e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bb0\u5f55\u3001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u5b50\u96c6\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5b50\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728PVS\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u53471.4\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u5728ROAD\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5b50\u96c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u534711.6\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u6570\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u5728\u591c\u95f4\u3001\u5927\u96e8\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u8868\u9762\u8f6c\u6362\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u6027\u89c6\u89c9\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7ecf\u6d4e\u578b\u76f8\u673a\u548cIMU\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u9053\u8def\u8868\u9762\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u73af\u5883\u591a\u53d8\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u5730\u533a\uff0c\u4e3a\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6491\u3002"}}

Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that ScatterFusion outperforms other common methods, achieving significant reductions in error metrics across various prediction horizons.", "AI": {"tldr": "ScatterFusion\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u6563\u5c04\u53d8\u6362\u4e0e\u5c42\u6b21\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9c81\u68d2\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u591a\u65f6\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u590d\u6742\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1) \u5c42\u6b21\u6563\u5c04\u53d8\u6362\u6a21\u5757\u63d0\u53d6\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0d\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2) \u5c3a\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7279\u5f81\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u4e0d\u540c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff1b3) \u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65f6\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b4) \u57fa\u4e8e\u8d8b\u52bf-\u5b63\u8282-\u6b8b\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u611f\u77e5\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cScatterFusion\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5e38\u89c1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8bef\u5dee\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "ScatterFusion\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u6563\u5c04\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u3002"}}

Recent approaches leverage generative models, such as diffusion models, to provide additional supervision, but face a trade-off between generalization and fidelity: fine-tuning diffusion models for artifact removal improves fidelity but risks overfitting, while fine-tuning-free methods preserve generalization but often yield lower fidelity. We introduce FreeFix, a fine-tuning-free approach that pushes the boundary of this trade-off by enhancing extrapolated rendering with pretrained image diffusion models. We present an interleaved 2D-3D refinement strategy, showing that image diffusion models can be leveraged for consistent refinement without relying on costly video diffusion models. Furthermore, we take a closer look at the guidance signal for 2D refinement and propose a per-pixel confidence mask to identify uncertain regions for targeted improvement. Experiments across multiple datasets show that FreeFix improves multi-frame consistency and achieves performance comparable to or surpassing fine-tuning-based methods, while retaining strong generalization ability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Mechanistic interpretability seeks to mitigate the issues through extracts human-interpretable process and concepts from LLMs' activations. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a popular approach for extracting interpretable and monosemantic concepts by decomposing the LLM internal representations into a dictionary. Despite their empirical progress, SAEs suffer from a fundamental theoretical ambiguity: the well-defined correspondence between LLM representations and human-interpretable concepts remains unclear. This lack of theoretical grounding gives rise to several methodological challenges, including difficulties in principled method design and evaluation criteria. In this work, we show that, under mild assumptions, LLM representations can be approximated as a {linear mixture} of the log-posteriors over concepts given the input context, through the lens of a latent variable model where concepts are treated as latent variables. This motivates a principled framework for concept extraction, namely Concept Component Analysis (ConCA), which aims to recover the log-posterior of each concept from LLM representations through a {unsupervised} linear unmixing process. We explore a specific variant, termed sparse ConCA, which leverages a sparsity prior to address the inherent ill-posedness of the unmixing problem. We implement 12 sparse ConCA variants and demonstrate their ability to extract meaningful concepts across multiple LLMs, offering theory-backed advantages over SAEs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To solve dynamic unbalanced optimal transport under the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao geometry, we further build on this framework to develop Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao Mean Flow Matching (WFR-MFM). Across synthetic and real single-cell RNA sequencing datasets, WFR-MFM achieves orders-of-magnitude faster inference than a range of existing baselines while maintaining high predictive accuracy, and enables efficient perturbation response prediction on large synthetic datasets with thousands of conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recent memorization detection methods are primarily based on the norm of score difference as indicators of memorization. We prove that such norm-based metrics are mainly effective under the assumption of isotropic log-probability distributions, which generally holds at high or medium noise levels. In contrast, analyzing the anisotropic regime reveals that memorized samples exhibit strong angular alignment between the guidance vector and unconditional scores in the low-noise setting. Through these insights, we develop a memorization detection metric by integrating isotropic norm and anisotropic alignment. Our detection metric can be computed directly on pure noise inputs via two conditional and unconditional forward passes, eliminating the need for costly denoising steps. Detection experiments on Stable Diffusion v1.4 and v2 show that our metric outperforms existing denoising-free detection methods while being at least approximately 5x faster than the previous best approach.

The results demonstrate that MORPHIN achieves superior convergence speed and continuous adaptation compared to a standard Q-learning baseline, improving learning efficiency by up to 1.7x.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MORPHIN\uff08\u81ea\u9002\u5e94Q\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u9002\u914d\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5e94\u7528\u5e38\u9762\u4e34\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u6216\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u5c55\u65f6\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u4e14\u5bb9\u6613\u53d1\u751f\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "method": "MORPHIN\u6846\u67b6\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u6f02\u79fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u81ea\u52a8\u8c03\u6574\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u6269\u5c55\u65f6\u7684\u9002\u914d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u5148\u524d\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728Gridworld\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u63a7\u5236\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\uff0cMORPHIN\u76f8\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6Q\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\u63d0\u53471.7\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "MORPHIN\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u975e\u5e73\u7a33\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u53d8\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u3002"}}

However, most quantization-aware training (QAT) methods apply hard rounding and the straight-through estimator (STE) from the beginning of the training, which prematurely discretizes the optimization landscape and induces persistent gradient mismatch between latent weights and quantized weights, hindering effective optimization of quantized models. To address this, we propose Hestia, a Hessian-guided differentiable QAT framework for extremely low-bit LLMs, which replaces the rigid step function with a temperature-controlled softmax relaxation to maintain gradient flow early in training while progressively hardening quantization. Furthermore, Hestia leverages a tensor-wise Hessian trace metric as a lightweight curvature signal to drive fine-grained temperature annealing, enabling sensitivity-aware discretization across the model. Evaluations on Llama-3.2 show that Hestia consistently outperforms existing ternary QAT baselines, yielding average zero-shot improvements of 5.39% and 4.34% for the 1B and 3B models.

We formalize this setting as reinforcement learning with rich feedback and introduce Self-Distillation Policy Optimization (SDPO), which converts tokenized feedback into a dense learning signal without any external teacher or explicit reward model. SDPO treats the current model conditioned on feedback as a self-teacher and distills its feedback-informed next-token predictions back into the policy. In this way, SDPO leverages the model's ability to retrospectively identify its own mistakes in-context. Across scientific reasoning, tool use, and competitive programming on LiveCodeBench v6, SDPO improves sample efficiency and final accuracy over strong RLVR baselines. Notably, SDPO also outperforms baselines in standard RLVR environments that only return scalar feedback by using successful rollouts as implicit feedback for failed attempts. Finally, applying SDPO to individual questions at test time accelerates discovery on difficult binary-reward tasks, achieving the same discovery probability as best-of-k sampling or multi-turn conversations with 3x fewer attempts.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The proposed CoBA model integrates convolutional, bidirectional recurrent, and attention layers to capture both spatial and temporal patterns in UAV radio measurements. To validate the model, a dedicated dataset is collected using the 5G mmWave network at TalTech, with controlled low altitude UAV flights in authorized and restricted scenarios.

Although recent works have highlighted that these explanations can be suboptimal and potentially misleading, a characterization of their failure cases is unavailable. In this work, we identify a critical failure of SE-GNN explanations: explanations can be unambiguously unrelated to how the SE-GNNs infer labels. We show that, on the one hand, many SE-GNNs can achieve optimal true risk while producing these degenerate explanations, and on the other, most faithfulness metrics can fail to identify these failure modes.

We identify the core challenge as the poor accessibility of informative failures: learning signals exist but are rarely encountered during standard rollouts. To address this, we propose failure-prefix conditioning, a simple and effective method for learning from saturated problems. Rather than starting from the original question, our approach reallocates exploration by conditioning training on prefixes derived from rare incorrect reasoning trajectories, thereby exposing the model to failure-prone states. We observe that failure-prefix conditioning yields performance gains matching those of training on medium-difficulty problems, while preserving token efficiency. Furthermore, we analyze the model's robustness, finding that our method reduces performance degradation under misleading failure prefixes, albeit with a mild trade-off in adherence to correct early reasoning. Finally, we demonstrate that an iterative approach, which refreshes failure prefixes during training, unlocks additional gains after performance plateaus.

We introduce the \"individual receptive field\" to uncover granular structural dependencies, revealing that convolutional layers act as feature extractors that mirror channel-wise attention while exhibiting superior robustness to non-linear fluctuations. Based on these insights, we propose ACFormer, an architecture designed to reconcile the efficiency of linear projections with the non-linear feature-extraction power of convolutions. ACFormer captures fine-grained information through a shared compression module, preserves temporal locality via gated attention, and reconstructs variable-specific temporal patterns using an independent patch expansion layer.

Because RMs are initialized from LLMs, they inherit representations that shape their behavior, but the nature and extent of this influence remain understudied. In a comprehensive study of 10 leading open-weight RMs using validated psycholinguistic corpora, we show that RMs exhibit significant differences along multiple dimensions of human value as a function of their base model. Using the \"Big Two\" psychological axes, we show a robust preference of Llama RMs for \"agency\" and a corresponding robust preference of Gemma RMs for \"communion.\" This phenomenon holds even when the preference data and finetuning process are identical, and we trace it back to the logits of the respective instruction-tuned and pre-trained models. These log-probability differences themselves can be formulated as an implicit RM; we derive usable implicit reward scores and show that they exhibit the very same agency/communion difference. We run experiments training RMs with ablations for preference data source and quantity, which demonstrate that this effect is not only repeatable but surprisingly durable. Despite RMs being designed to represent human preferences, our evidence shows that their outputs are influenced by the pretrained LLMs on which they are based. This work underscores the importance of safety and alignment efforts at the pretraining stage, and makes clear that open-source developers' choice of base model is as much a consideration of values as of performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce the first foundation model for virtual sensors addressing both limitations. Our unified model can simultaneously predict diverse virtual sensors exploiting synergies while maintaining computational efficiency. It learns relevant input signals for each virtual sensor, eliminating expert knowledge requirements while adding explainability. In our large-scale evaluation on a standard benchmark and an application-specific dataset with over 18 billion samples, our architecture achieves 415x reduction in computation time and 951x reduction in memory requirements, while maintaining or even improving predictive quality compared to baselines.

Using noisy, synthetic data from two damped oscillatory systems, we explore the extrapolation capabilities of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODEs) and the ability of Symbolic Regression (SR) to recover the underlying equations. Our study yields three key insights. First, we demonstrate that NODEs can extrapolate effectively to new boundary conditions, provided the resulting trajectories share dynamic similarity with the training data. Second, SR successfully recovers the equations from noisy ground-truth data, though its performance is contingent on the correct selection of input variables. Finally, we find that SR recovers two out of the three governing equations, along with a good approximation for the third, when using data generated by a NODE trained on just 10% of the full simulation. While this last finding highlights an area for future work, our results suggest that using NODEs to enrich limited data and enable symbolic regression to infer physical laws represents a promising new approach for scientific discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Specifically, Cofair introduces a shared representation layer with fairness-conditioned adapter modules to produce user embeddings specialized for varied fairness levels, along with a user-level regularization term that guarantees user-wise monotonic fairness improvements across these levels. We theoretically establish that the adversarial objective of Cofair upper bounds demographic parity and the regularization term enforces progressive fairness at user level. Comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets and backbone models demonstrate that our framework provides dynamic fairness at different levels, delivering comparable or better fairness-accuracy curves than state-of-the-art baselines, without the need to retrain for each new fairness requirement.

This interaction enables the model to align its notion of change with that of the user, improving both accuracy and interpretability. Our experimental results on several real-world datasets show the effectiveness of MuRAL-CPD against state-of-the-art methods, particularly in scenarios where minimal supervision is available.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Implementing such continually learning systems have several challenges, one of which is the large memory requirement of gradient-based algorithms that are used to train state-of-the-art LLMs. Evolutionary Strategies (ES) have recently re-emerged as a gradient-free alternative to traditional learning algorithms and have shown encouraging performance on specific tasks in LLMs. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive analysis of ES and specifically evaluate its forgetting curves when training for an increasing number of update steps. We first find that ES is able to reach performance numbers close to GRPO for math and reasoning tasks with a comparable compute budget. However, and most importantly for continual learning, the performance gains in ES is accompanied by significant forgetting of prior abilities, limiting its applicability for training models online. We also explore the reason behind this behavior and show that the updates made using ES are much less sparse and have orders of magnitude larger $\\ell_2$ norm compared to corresponding GRPO updates, explaining the contrasting forgetting curves between the two algorithms. With this study, we aim to highlight the issue of forgetting in gradient-free algorithms like ES and hope to inspire future work to mitigate these issues.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The main reason is that RL alignment typically requires either expensive human preference annotation or heavy reliance on high-quality reward models with large-scale API usage and ongoing engineering maintenance, both of which are ill-suited to on-premise settings. To bridge this gap, we propose a positive-unlabeled (PU) RL distillation method for on-premise small-model deployment. Without human-labeled preferences or a reward model, our method distills the teacher's preference-optimization capability from black-box generations into a locally trainable student. For each prompt, we query the teacher once to obtain an anchor response, locally sample multiple student candidates, and perform anchor-conditioned self-ranking to induce pairwise or listwise preferences, enabling a fully local training loop via direct preference optimization or group relative policy optimization. Theoretical analysis justifies that the induced preference signal by our method is order-consistent and concentrates on near-optimal candidates, supporting its stability for preference optimization.

We instead learn an explicit optimal transport map that sends any group instance to its counterfactual without re-optimization, minimizing the group's total transport cost. This enables generalization with fewer parameters, making it easier to interpret the common actionable recourse. For linear classifiers, we prove that functions representing group counterfactuals are derived via mathematical optimization, identifying the underlying convex optimization type (QP, QCQP, ...).

Despite decades of empirical evidence that greedy, exploitation-only methods work remarkably well in these settings, theory has lagged behind: all existing regret guarantees for Exo-MDPs rely on explicit exploration or tabular assumptions. We show that exploration is unnecessary. We propose Pure Exploitation Learning (PEL) and prove the first general finite-sample regret bounds for exploitation-only algorithms in Exo-MDPs.

The limited availability of labeled data for training often constrains the performance of ANN-based Cox models. To address this issue, we employed a deep semi-supervised learning (DSSL) approach to develop single- and multi-modal ANN-based Cox models based on the Mean Teacher (MT) framework, which utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data for training.

To address this gap, we introduce GraphAllocBench, a flexible benchmark built on a novel graph-based resource allocation sandbox environment inspired by city management, which we call CityPlannerEnv. GraphAllocBench provides a rich suite of problems with diverse objective functions, varying preference conditions, and high-dimensional scalability.

We address this, assuming that either the prior lies in the Cameron-Martin space, or is absolutely continuous with respect to a Gaussian measure. We prove that the models can be conditioned using an infinite-dimensional extension of Doob's $h$-transform, and that the conditional score decomposes into an unconditional score and a guidance term.

Scarce data or datasets dominated by out-of-distribution (OOD) areas exacerbate this issue. Our theoretical analysis and experiments show that the standard squared error objective induces a harmful TD cross covariance. This effect amplifies in OOD areas, biasing optimization and degrading policy learning. To counteract this mechanism, we develop two complementary strategies: partitioned buffer sampling that restricts updates to localized replay partitions, attenuates irregular covariance effects, and aligns update directions, yielding a scheme that is easy to integrate with existing implementations, namely Clustered Cross-Covariance Control for TD (C^4).

In such settings, black-box copying provides a practical refactoring mechanism, i.e. upgrading legacy models by learning replicas from input-output queries alone. When restricted to hard-label outputs, copying turns into a discontinuous surface reconstruction problem from pointwise queries, severely limiting the ability to recover boundary geometry efficiently. We propose a distance-based copying (distillation) framework that replaces hard-label supervision with signed distances to the teacher's decision boundary, converting copying into a smooth regression problem that exploits local geometry. We develop an $\u03b1$-governed smoothing and regularization scheme with H\u00f6lder/Lipschitz control over the induced target surface, and introduce two model-agnostic algorithms to estimate signed distances under label-only access.

We make two main contributions. First, we provide the first analysis of the disagreement coefficient for decision trees-a key parameter governing active learning label complexity. Our analysis holds under two natural assumptions required for achieving polylogarithmic label complexity, (i) each root-to-leaf path queries distinct feature dimensions, and (ii) the input data has a regular, grid-like structure. We show these assumptions are essential, as relaxing them leads to polynomial label complexity. Second, we present the first general active learning algorithm for binary classification that achieves a multiplicative error guarantee, producing a $(1+\u03b5)$-approximate classifier. By combining these results, we design an active learning algorithm for decision trees that uses only a polylogarithmic number of label queries in the dataset size, under the stated assumptions. Finally, we establish a label complexity lower bound, showing our algorithm's dependence on the error tolerance $\u03b5$ is close to optimal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e8c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6807\u6ce8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u5bf9\u6570\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u9996\u4e2a\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u6837\u672c\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u6807\u6ce8\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u7cfb\u6570\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u5bf9\u6570\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u5047\u8bbe\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u6839\u5230\u53f6\u8def\u5f84\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u6570\u636e\u5177\u6709\u89c4\u5219\u7f51\u683c\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u63a5\u7740\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5b9e\u73b0(1+\u03b5)\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u5408\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u4ec5\u9700\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u5bf9\u6570\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\u67e5\u8be2\u3002\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6807\u6ce8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\u03b5\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u8fd1\u4e4e\u6700\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8fd1\u4e4e\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u754c\u9650\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5206\u6790\u6811\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6807\u6ce8\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Many existing approaches require domain-specific feature engineering and substantial labeled data for each task. We introduce PatchFormer, a patch-based time series foundation model that uses hierarchical masked reconstruction for self-supervised pretraining and lightweight adapters for efficient transfer. PatchFormer segments time series into patches and learns multiscale temporal representations with learnable aggregation across temporal scales. Pretraining uses masked patch reconstruction with dynamic masking and objectives that encourage both local accuracy and global consistency, followed by cross-domain knowledge distillation. Experiments on 24 benchmark datasets spanning weather, energy, traffic, finance, and healthcare demonstrate state-of-the-art zero-shot multi-horizon forecasting, reducing mean squared error by 27.3 percent relative to strong baselines while requiring 94 percent less task-specific training data. The model exhibits near log-linear scaling with more pretraining data up to 100 billion points and processes length-512 sequences 3.8x faster than full-sequence transformers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
