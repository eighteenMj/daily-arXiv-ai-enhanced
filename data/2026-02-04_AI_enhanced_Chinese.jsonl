This limits adaptability in rural, nomadic, and bandwidth-constrained environments where traffic distributions, propagation characteristics, and user behavior fluctuate rapidly. Artificial Intelligence (AI), more specifically Machine Learning (ML) models, provide new opportunities to transition Radio Access Networks (RANs) from rigid, rule-based systems toward adaptive, self-optimizing infrastructures that can respond autonomously to these dynamics. This paper proposes a practical architecture incorporating AI-assisted planning, reinforcement-learning-based RAN optimization, real-time telemetry analytics, and digital-twin-based validation. In parallel, the paper addresses the challenge of delivering embodied-AI healthcare services, educational tools, and large language model (LLM) applications to communities with insufficient backhaul for cloud computing. We introduce an edge-hosted execution model in which applications run directly on LTE/5G-NR base stations using containers, reducing latency and bandwidth consumption while improving resilience. Together, these contributions demonstrate how AI can enhance network performance, reduce operational overhead, and expand access to advanced digital services, aligning with broader goals of sustainable and inclusive network development.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Delivering such latency-sensitive experiences involves considerable challenges in orchestrating network, computing, and service resources, where existing limitations highlight the need for a structured approach to analyse and optimise these complex systems. This challenge is amplified by the need for high-performance, low-latency connectivity, where 5G and 6G networks provide essential infrastructure to meet the requirements of XR services at scale. This article addresses these challenges by developing a model that parametrises multi-user XR services across four critical layers of the standard virtualisation architecture. We formalise this model mathematically, proposing a context-aware framework that defines key parameters at each level and integrates them into a comprehensive Edge-Cloud Continuum orchestration strategy. Our contributions include a detailed analysis of the current limitations and needs in existing Edge-Cloud Continuum orchestration approaches, the formulation of a layered mathematical model, and a validation framework that demonstrates the utility and feasibility of the proposed solution.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A key challenge lies in balancing the CSI feedback overhead with the achievable downlink rate, i.e., maximizing the utility of limited feedback to maintain high system performance. In this work, we propose a precoding-oriented CSI feedback framework based on a vector quantized variational autoencoder, augmented with an information-theoretic regularization. To achieve this, we introduce a differentiable mutual information lower-bound estimator as a training regularizer to promote effective utilization of the learned codebook under a fixed feedback budget. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves rates comparable to variable-length neural compression schemes, while operating with fixed-length feedback. Furthermore, the learned codewords exhibit significantly more uniform usage and capture interpretable structures that are strongly correlated with the underlying channel state information.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u9884\u7f16\u7801\u5bfc\u5411CSI\u53cd\u9988\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u6709\u9650\u53cd\u9988\u5e26\u5bbd\u4e0b\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728CSI\u53cd\u9988\u5f00\u9500\u4e0e\u4e0b\u884c\u901f\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6709\u9650\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u6548\u7528\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5411\u91cf\u91cf\u5316\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0b\u754c\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b63\u5219\u9879\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u53cd\u9988\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7801\u672c\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u957f\u5ea6\u53cd\u9988\u4e0b\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u53d8\u957f\u795e\u7ecf\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6848\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7387\uff0c\u5b66\u5230\u7684\u7801\u5b57\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5747\u5300\u4e14\u80fd\u6355\u83b7\u4e0e\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861CSI\u53cd\u9988\u538b\u7f29\u4e0e\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u53cd\u9988\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u72b6\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u538b\u7f29\u3002"}}

A neural network is then trained to super-resolve these maps using data generated with the dead leaves model, which replicates the statistical properties of real abundances.

Although progress has been made in SoH estimation, CtCV estimation remains unresolved in the literature. This paper proposes a unified framework that accurately estimates both CtCV and SoH for modules using only module-level information extracted from incremental capacity analysis (ICA) and differential voltage analysis (DVA). With the proposed framework, CtCV and SoH estimations can be decoupled into two separate tasks, allowing each to be solved with dedicated algorithms without mutual interference and providing greater design flexibility. The framework also exhibits strong versatility in accommodating different CtCV metrics, highlighting its general-purpose nature. Experimental validation on modules with three parallel-connected cells demonstrates that the proposed framework can systematically select optimal module-level features for CtCV and SoH estimations, deliver accurate CtCV and SoH estimates with high confidence and low computational complexity, remain effective across different C-rates, and be suitable for onboard implementation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4ece\u6a21\u5757\u7ea7\u589e\u91cf\u5bb9\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5fae\u5206\u7535\u538b\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5c31\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u5e76\u8054\u7535\u6c60\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u7535\u6c60\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u5f3a\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u5e76\u8054\u7535\u6c60\u6a21\u5757\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f53\u53ea\u80fd\u6d4b\u91cf\u6a21\u5757\u7ea7\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u89c2\u5bdf\u5355\u4e2a\u7535\u6c60\u884c\u4e3a\u65f6\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u4f30\u8ba1\u7535\u6c60\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u6001\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u9762\u867d\u6709\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u7535\u6c60\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u4ecd\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u7ea7\u589e\u91cf\u5bb9\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5fae\u5206\u7535\u538b\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5c06\u7535\u6c60\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6301\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7535\u6c60\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u5ea6\u91cf\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u7528\u7b97\u6cd5\u5206\u522b\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u76f8\u4e92\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5e76\u8054\u7535\u6c60\u7ec4\u6210\u7684\u6a21\u5757\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f18\u6a21\u5757\u7ea7\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ee5\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u7535\u6c60\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u500d\u7387\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u9002\u5408\u8f66\u8f7d\u5b9e\u65bd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5e76\u8054\u7535\u6c60\u6a21\u5757\u4e2d\u7535\u6c60\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u5065\u5eb7\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u7ea7\u4fe1\u606f\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e3a\u7535\u6c60\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although various improvements have been introduced to NS iteration, they fail to deviate from the conventional iterative paradigm, which could increase computation burden largely due to the matrix products along the long dimension repeatedly. To address this, we consolidate the iterative structure into a unified framework, named Unified Newton-Schulz Orthogonalization (UNSO). To do so, we could avoid a polynomial expansion. Instead, we evaluate the role of each matrix power, remove the insignificant terms, and provide a recommended polynomial with learnable coefficients. These learnable coefficients are then optimized, and achieve an outstanding performance with stable convergence.

This work proposes a novel sensing paradigm in which an event camera observes the optically generated cosine transform of a visual scene, enabling high-speed, computation-free video compression inspired by modern video codecs. In this study, we simulate this optically passive vision compression (OPVC) scheme and compare its rate-distortion performance to that of a standalone event camera (SAEC). We find that the rate-distortion performance of the OPVC scheme surpasses that of the SAEC and that this performance gap increases as the spatial resolution of the event camera increases.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Consequently, they obscure the distinction between adaptive mode selection and general performance while neglecting fine-grained process analyses. In this paper, we propose AdaptMMBench, a comprehensive benchmark for adaptive multimodal reasoning across five domains: real-world, OCR, GUI, knowledge, and math, encompassing both direct perception and complex reasoning tasks. AdaptMMBench utilizes a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) metric to evaluate the selection rationality of different reasoning modes, isolating this meta-cognition ability by dynamically identifying task difficulties based on models' capability boundaries. Moreover, AdaptMMBench facilitates multi-dimensional process evaluation across key step coverage, tool effectiveness, and computational efficiency.

This work considers the problem of HF channel estimation (CE) and introduces a unified model that superimposes FF and NF contributions according to the Rayleigh distance boundary. By exploiting the inherent sparsity of the channel in the angular and polar domains, we formulate the estimation task as a sparse recovery problem. Unlike conventional approaches that require prior knowledge of the channel sparsity level, the proposed method operates without requiring knowledge of the sparsity level L and the NF/FF ratio \u03b3, which are used only for synthetic channel generation in simulations. The channel estimator determines the number of paths adaptively through a residual-based stopping rule. A combined FF/NF dictionary is employed to initialize the support, and each selected atom undergoes continuous parameter refinement to mitigate grid mismatch. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed estimator achieves accurate HF channel reconstruction under both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions, offering a practical and computationally efficient solution for XL-MIMO systems.\n  Extremely Large-Scale MIMO (XL-MIMO); Channel State Information (CSI); Channel estimation (CE); hybrid-field (HF) wave propagation; near-field (NF) spherical wave model; far-field (FF) planar wave model", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8eXL-MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u573a\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5148\u77e5\u9053\u4fe1\u9053\u7a00\u758f\u5ea6\u3001\u8fd1\u573a/\u8fdc\u573a\u6bd4\u4f8b\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u786e\u5b9a\u8def\u5f84\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u7ec6\u5316\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6062\u590d\u6846\u67b6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u4fe1\u9053\u91cd\u6784\u3002", "motivation": "XL-MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5927\u9635\u5217\u5b54\u5f84\u5bfc\u81f4\u6df7\u5408\u573a\u4f20\u64ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5148\u9a8c\u53c2\u6570\u4fe1\u606f\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406FF/NF\u5171\u5b58\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u91c7\u7528\u7edf\u4e00\u7684FF+NF\u53e0\u52a0\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u6062\u590d\u6846\u67b6\u8fdb\u884c\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u7ec4\u5408\u5b57\u5178\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u652f\u6301\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6b8b\u5dee\u505c\u6b62\u89c4\u5219\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u786e\u5b9a\u8def\u5f84\u6570\u91cf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u91c7\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u53c2\u6570\u7ec6\u5316\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u7f51\u683c\u5931\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u5728LoS\u548cNLoS\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u573a\u4fe1\u9053\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u4e3aXL-MIMO\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3aXL-MIMO\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u573a\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4fe1\u9053\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5904\u7406\u4fe1\u9053\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u5bf9\u5148\u9a8c\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, these agents often struggle in specialized, tool-intensive domains that demand long-horizon execution, tight coordination across modalities, and strict adherence to implicit tool constraints. Earth Observation (EO) tasks exemplify this challenge due to the multi-modal and multi-temporal data inputs, as well as the requirements of geo-knowledge constraints (spectrum library, spatial reasoning, etc): many high-level plans can be derailed by subtle execution errors that propagate through a pipeline and invalidate final results. A core difficulty is that existing agents lack a mechanism to learn fine-grained, tool-level expertise from interaction. Without such expertise, they cannot reliably configure tool parameters or recover from mid-execution failures, limiting their effectiveness in complex EO workflows. To address this, we introduce \\textbf{GeoEvolver}, a self-evolving multi-agent system~(MAS) that enables LLM agents to acquire EO expertise through structured interaction without any parameter updates. GeoEvolver decomposes each query into independent sub-goals via a retrieval-augmented multi-agent orchestrator, then explores diverse tool-parameter configurations at the sub-goal level.

In this paper, we extend CPA to straggler-aware distributed computing systems with a pre-specified non-straggler pattern, where exact recovery is required for a given collection of admissible non-straggler sets. Our main results show that exact recovery of the desired aggregation is achievable with fewer worker responses than that required by polynomial codes based on individual decoding, and that feasibility is characterized by the intersection structure of the non-straggler patterns. In particular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for exact recovery in straggler-aware CPA. We identify an intersection-size threshold that is sufficient to guarantee exact recovery. When the number of admissible non-straggler sets is sufficiently large, we further show that this threshold is necessary in a generic sense.

The central challenge lies in balancing solution accuracy with computational efficiency. Recent diffusion-based generative models produce high-quality samples; however, their slow sampling procedures limit practical scalability. In this work, we argue that exact physical feasibility is ultimately enforced by power flow solvers or projection steps, and therefore the generative model only needs to produce good initializations rather than perfectly feasible solutions.

To tackle these issues, we propose a Sparse Adapter Fusion Method (SAFM), which dynamically fuses old and new adapters to address these challenges. SAFM operates in two stages: the decision stage and the tuning stage. In the decision stage, SAFM determines whether to incorporate a new adapter, reuse an existing one, or add an empty adapter. The architecture search procedure, designed to prioritize reusing or adding empty adapters, minimizes parameter consumption and maximizes reuse. In the tuning stage, SAFM especially facilitates a layer-wise loss to encourage differentiation between adapters, effectively capturing knowledge within the same task.

Such graph-central paradigm breaks down on composite materials, which possess continuous and nonlinear design spaces that lack well-defined graph structures. General composite descriptors, e.g., fiber volume and misalignment angle, cannot fully capture the fiber distributions that fundamentally determine microstructural characteristics, necessitating the integration of heterogeneous data sources through multimodal learning. Existing alignment-oriented multimodal frameworks have proven effective on abundant crystal or polymer data under discrete, unique graph-property mapping assumptions, but fail to address the highly continuous composite design space under extreme data scarcity. In this work, we introduce ORDinal-aware imagE-tabulaR alignment (ORDER), a multimodal pretraining framework that establishes ordinality as a core principle for composite material representations. ORDER ensures that materials with similar target properties occupy nearby regions in the latent space, which effectively preserves the continuous nature of composite properties and enables meaningful interpolation between sparsely observed designs. We evaluate ORDER on a public Nanofiber-enforced composite dataset and an internally curated dataset that simulates the construction of carbon fiber T700 with diverse fiber distributions.

However, high-speed acquisitions often degrade spatial resolution and increase speckle noise, posing challenges for accurate interpretation. We propose an advanced super-resolution framework leveraging diffusion model plug-and-play (PnP) priors to achieve 4x spatial resolution enhancement alongside effective denoising of OCT Bscan images. Our approach formulates reconstruction as a principled Bayesian inverse problem, combining Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling with pretrained generative priors to enforce anatomical consistency. We comprehensively validate the framework using \\emph{in vivo} fisheye corneal datasets, to assess robustness and scalability under diverse clinical settings. Comparative experiments against bicubic interpolation, conventional supervised U-Net baselines, and alternative diffusion priors demonstrate that our method consistently yields more precise anatomical structures, improved delineation of corneal layers, and superior noise suppression. Quantitative results show state-of-the-art performance in peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity index, and perceptual metrics. This work highlights the potential of diffusion-driven plug-and-play reconstruction to deliver high-fidelity, high-resolution OCT imaging, supporting more reliable clinical assessments and enabling advanced image-guided interventions.

Traditional manual landmarking is time-consuming and prone to inter-observer variability, while rule-based methods are often tailored to specific geometries or limited sets of landmarks. In recent years, anatomical surfaces have been effectively represented as point clouds, which are lightweight structures composed of spatial coordinates. Following this strategy and to overcome the limitations of existing landmarking techniques, we propose Landmark Point Transformer (LmPT), a method for automatic anatomical landmark detection on point clouds that can leverage homologous bones from different species for translational research. The LmPT model incorporates a conditioning mechanism that enables adaptability to different input types to conduct cross-species learning.

We evaluate 18 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, e.g., Gemini 3, GPT-5.2, and Claude 4.5, on 7,000 counterfactuals from popular datasets covering health, business, and ethics. We find self-explanations substantially improve prediction of model behavior (11-37% NSG). Self-explanations also provide more predictive information than explanations generated by external models, even when those models are stronger. This implies an advantage from self-knowledge that external explanation methods cannot replicate. Our approach also reveals that, across models, 5-15% of self-explanations are egregiously misleading. Despite their imperfections, we show a positive case for self-explanations: they encode information that helps predict model behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6a21\u62df\u589e\u76ca(NSG)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u81ea\u6211\u89e3\u91ca\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u7684\u65b0\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u81ea\u6211\u89e3\u91ca\u76f8\u6bd4\u5916\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u67095-15%\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u89e3\u91ca\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u81ea\u6211\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u5ea6\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u63d0\u793a\u6216\u68c0\u6d4b\u63a8\u7406\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6307\u6807\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u6211\u89e3\u91ca\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u6a21\u578b\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6a21\u62df\u589e\u76ca(NSG)\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u601d\u60f3\uff1a\u5982\u679c\u89e3\u91ca\u662f\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u8005\u5e94\u8be5\u80fd\u591f\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u9884\u6d4b\u5176\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8618\u4e2a\u524d\u6cbf\u4e13\u6709\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u57287,000\u4e2a\u6765\u81ea\u5065\u5eb7\u3001\u5546\u4e1a\u3001\u4f26\u7406\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5bf9\u6297\u6837\u672c\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0", "result": "\u81ea\u6211\u89e3\u91ca\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b(NSG\u63d0\u534711-37%)\uff1b\u81ea\u6211\u89e3\u91ca\u6bd4\u5916\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u591a\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5916\u90e8\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5f3a\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d5-15%\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u89e3\u91ca\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027", "conclusion": "\u867d\u7136LLM\u81ea\u6211\u89e3\u91ca\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u7f8e\u4e4b\u5904(\u5982\u90e8\u5206\u89e3\u91ca\u5177\u6709\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027)\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u786e\u5b9e\u7f16\u7801\u4e86\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4e14\u81ea\u6211\u77e5\u8bc6\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u662f\u5916\u90e8\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u590d\u5236\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u81ea\u6211\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u79ef\u6781\u652f\u6301"}}

We present a lightweight, topology aware M-mode segmentation pipeline based on UNeXt that incorporates anatomical topology regularization to stabilize boundary continuity and layer ordering under low signal to noise ratio conditions. The proposed system achieves end to end throughput exceeding 80 Hz measured over the complete preprocessing inference overlay pipeline on a single GPU, demonstrating practical real time guidance beyond model only timing.

Effective anonymization relies on the exhaustive localization of every individual; even a single missed detection necessitates extensive manual correction. However, existing approaches face two critical scalability bottlenecks: (1) they usually require manual annotations of each new clinical site for high accuracy; (2) while multi-camera setups have been widely adopted to address single-view ambiguity, camera calibration is typically required whenever cameras are repositioned. To address these problems, we propose a novel self-supervised multi-view video anonymization framework consisting of whole-body person detection and whole-body pose estimation, without annotation or camera calibration. Our core strategy is to enhance the single-view detector by \"retrieving\" false negatives using temporal and multi-view context, and conducting self-supervised domain adaptation. We first run an off-the-shelf whole-body person detector in each view with a low-score threshold to gather candidate detections. Then, we retrieve the low-score false negatives that exhibit consistency with the high-score detections via tracking and self-supervised uncalibrated multi-view association. These recovered detections serve as pseudo labels to iteratively fine-tune the whole-body detector. Finally, we apply whole-body pose estimation on each detected person, and fine-tune the pose model using its own high-score predictions. Experiments on the 4D-OR dataset of simulated surgeries and our dataset of real surgeries show the effectiveness of our approach achieving over 97% recall. Moreover, we train a real-time whole-body detector using our pseudo labels, achieving comparable performance and highlighting our method's practical applicability.

Reasoning over such graph-structured knowledge poses two key challenges: (1) navigating structured, schema-defined relations requires precise function calls rather than similarity-based retrieval, and (2) answering complex questions often demands multi-hop evidence aggregation through iterative information seeking. We propose GraphDancer, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework that teaches LLMs to navigate graphs by interleaving reasoning and function execution. To make RL effective for moderate-sized LLMs, we introduce a graph-aware curriculum that schedules training by the structural complexity of information-seeking trajectories using an easy-to-hard biased sampler. We evaluate GraphDancer on a multi-domain benchmark by training on one domain only and testing on unseen domains and out-of-distribution question types. Despite using only a 3B backbone, GraphDancer outperforms baselines equipped with either a 14B backbone or GPT-4o-mini, demonstrating robust cross-domain generalization of graph exploration and reasoning skills.

This problem has immediate relevance in standardized communication systems where the decoder acquires side information or priors about the true distribution that are unavailable to the fixed encoder. We formally define the mismatched quantization problem, demonstrating that the optimal reconstruction rule, termed generative decompression, aligns with classical Bayesian estimation by taking the conditional expectation under the true distribution given the quantization indices and adapting it to fixed-encoder constraints. This strategy effectively performs a generative Bayesian correction on the decoder side, strictly outperforming the conventional centroid rule. We extend this framework to transmission over noisy channels, deriving a robust soft-decoding rule that quantifies the inefficiency of standard modular source--channel separation architectures under mismatch. Furthermore, we generalize the approach to task-oriented decoding, showing that the optimal strategy shifts from conditional mean estimation to maximum a posteriori (MAP) detection.

While recent methods enhance CoT through static enumeration or attention-based selection, they remain passive, i.e., processing pre-computed inputs rather than actively seeking task-relevant details. Inspired by human active perception, we introduce ViThinker, a framework that enables vision-language models to autonomously generate decision (query) tokens triggering the synthesis of expert-aligned visual features on demand.

The rationale for SDPA has been based upon \"query, key, value\" concepts borrowed from database theory, but these concepts are difficult to reconcile with standard methods in mathematical signal processing. We show that SDPA can be rewritten in a different but mathematically equivalent form as a projection of the input vectors onto a common surface determined by the inputs themselves. Therefore SDPA discovers nonlinear dependencies in the input that are time-dependent and context-dependent. The rewritten form of SDPA permits increased speed of both feedforward and learning algorithms, but more importantly suggests potential extensions. In the context of language, we re-interpret the role of SDPA as finding a time-dependent contextual meaning determined by the surface on which the set of input vectors lies. Input token embeddings are then modified by the local context surface.

In this paper, we study DPIC problem under heterogeneous side-information cardinalities. We propose a transmission scheme that coordinates client broadcasts to maximize coding efficiency while ensuring that each client achieves a common target level $T$. In addition, we impose a strict security constraint that no client acquires more than the target $T$ number of messages, guaranteeing that each client ends up with exactly $T$ messages.

Recent advances in artificial intelligence have facilitated the development of skillful pan-Arctic sea ice forecasting systems, where data-driven approaches showcase tremendous potential to outperform conventional physics-based numerical models in terms of accuracy, computational efficiency and forecasting lead times. Despite the latest progress made by deep learning (DL) forecasting models, most of their skillful forecasting lead times are confined to daily subseasonal scale and monthly averaged values for up to six months, which drastically hinders their deployment for real-world applications, e.g., maritime routine planning for Arctic transportation and scientific investigation. Extending daily forecasts from subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) scale is scientifically crucial for operational applications. To bridge the gap between the forecasting lead time of current DL models and the significant daily S2S scale, we introduce IceBench-S2S, the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating DL approaches in mitigating the challenge of forecasting Arctic sea ice concentration in successive 180-day periods. It proposes a generalized framework that first compresses spatial features of daily sea ice data into a deep latent space. The temporally concatenated deep features are subsequently modeled by DL-based forecasting backbones to predict the sea ice variation at S2S scale. IceBench-S2S provides a unified training and evaluation pipeline for different backbones, along with practical guidance for model selection in polar environmental monitoring tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce a contrastive, document-aware reference selection framework that constructs compact evidence sets optimized for discrimination rather than similarity by explicitly balancing visual relevance, embedding diversity, and source-level provenance using ROCO embeddings and metadata. While ROCO provides large-scale image-caption pairs, it does not specify how references should be selected for contrastive reasoning, and naive retrieval frequently yields near-duplicate figures from the same document. To address this gap, we release a reproducible reference selection protocol and curated reference bank that enable a systematic study of contrastive retrieval in medical image reasoning. Building on these contrastive evidence sets, we propose Counterfactual-Contrastive Inference, a confidence-aware reasoning framework that performs structured pairwise visual comparisons and aggregates evidence using margin-based decision rules with faithful abstention. On the MediConfusion benchmark, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving set-level accuracy by nearly 15% relative to prior methods while reducing confusion and improving individual accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6587\u6863\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u9274\u522b\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u51b3\u7b56\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd4\u56de\u5197\u4f59\u8bc1\u636e\u5e76\u5f3a\u5316\u5355\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4f46\u533b\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u9700\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ec6\u5fae\u89c6\u89c9\u5dee\u5f02\u8fdb\u884c\u9274\u522b\u3002ROCO\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u867d\u63d0\u4f9b\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u56fe\u50cf-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u6307\u5b9a\u5982\u4f55\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53c2\u8003\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "method": "1) \u6784\u5efa\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6587\u6863\u611f\u77e5\u53c2\u8003\u9009\u62e9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u89c6\u89c9\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u5d4c\u5165\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6765\u6e90\u8ffd\u8e2a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528ROCO\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6210\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u6bd4\u8f83\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fb9\u754c\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5f03\u6743\u805a\u5408\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728MediConfusion\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u96c6\u5408\u7ea7\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fd115%\uff0c\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u6df7\u6dc6\u3001\u63d0\u5347\u4e2a\u4f53\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u53c2\u8003\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u533b\u5b66\u5f71\u50cf\u9274\u522b\u8bca\u65ad\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u4fe1\u533b\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This duality highlights a reciprocal connection in which prompts support control system design while control theory helps shape prompts to achieve specific goals efficiently. In this study, we frame this emerging interconnection of LLM and control as a bidirectional continuum, from prompt design to system dynamics. First, we investigate how LLMs can advance the field of control in two distinct capacities: directly, by assisting in the design and synthesis of controllers, and indirectly, by augmenting research workflows. Second, we examine how control concepts help LLMs steer their trajectories away from undesired meanings, improving reachability and alignment via input optimization, parameter editing, and activation-level interventions. Third, we look into deeper integrations by treating LLMs as dynamic systems within a state-space framework, where their internal representations are closely linked to external control loops. Finally, we identify key challenges and outline future research directions to understand LLM behavior and develop interpretable and controllable LLMs that are as trustworthy and robust as their electromechanical counterparts, thereby ensuring they continue to support and safeguard society.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c06\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u5173\u7cfb\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fde\u7eed\u7edf\u4e00\u4f53\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e24\u8005\u5982\u4f55\u76f8\u4e92\u4fc3\u8fdb", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6b63\u5728\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u9700\u8981\u8c03\u63a7\u7684\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u80fd\u589e\u5f3a\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u5de5\u7a0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u53cc\u5411\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e92\u60e0\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u4e2a\u5c42\u6b21\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u7814\u7a76LLMs\u5982\u4f55\u76f4\u63a5\u8f85\u52a9\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u95f4\u63a5\u589e\u5f3a\u7814\u7a76\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1b2\uff09\u5e94\u7528\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u4f18\u5316LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\uff1b3\uff09\u5c06LLMs\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b4\uff09\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\u548c\u672a\u6765\u65b9\u5411", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5168\u9762\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u8fde\u7eed\u7edf\u4e00\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86LLMs\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u6574\u5408\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91caLLMs\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76LLM\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u4e0e\u673a\u7535\u7cfb\u7edf\u540c\u6837\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u5b89\u5168\u670d\u52a1\u793e\u4f1a"}}

While practitioners commonly believe a higher task success rate necessitates the use of a larger and stronger LLM model, multi-step interaction with a large LLM incurs prohibitive inference cost. To address this problem, we explore the use of low-precision quantized LLM in the long-horizon decision-making process. Based on the observation of diverse sensitivities among interaction steps, we propose a dynamic mix-precision routing framework that adaptively selects between high-precision and low-precision LLMs at each decision step. The router is trained via a two-stage pipeline, consisting of KL-divergence-based supervised learning that identifies precision-sensitive steps, followed by Group-Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to further improve task success rates.

This is especially pronounced in medical image analysis, where data is often scarce and covariate shifts arise from different hardware devices, imaging protocols, and heterogeneous patient populations. These factors collectively hinder reliable performance and slow down clinical adoption. Despite recent progress, existing learning paradigms primarily rely on the Euclidean manifold, whose flat geometry fails to capture the complex, hierarchical structures present in clinical data. In this work, we exploit the advantages of hyperbolic manifolds to model complex data characteristics. We present the first comprehensive validation of hyperbolic representation learning for medical image analysis and demonstrate statistically significant gains across eleven in-distribution datasets and three ViT models. We further propose an unsupervised, domain-invariant hyperbolic cross-branch consistency constraint. Extensive experiments confirm that our proposed method promotes domain-invariant features and outperforms state-of-the-art Euclidean methods by an average of $+2.1\\%$ AUC on three domain generalization benchmarks: Fitzpatrick17k, Camelyon17-WILDS, and a cross-dataset setup for retinal imaging.

We present FaceLinkGen, an identity extraction attack that performs linkage/matching and face regeneration directly from protected templates without recovering original pixels. On three recent PPFR systems, FaceLinkGen reaches over 98.5\\% matching accuracy and above 96\\% regeneration success, and still exceeds 92\\% matching and 94\\% regeneration in a near zero knowledge setting. These results expose a structural gap between pixel distortion metrics, which are widely used in PPFR evaluation, and real privacy.

We introduce Cuttlefish, a unified all-atom LLM that grounds language reasoning in geometric cues while scaling modality tokens with structural complexity. First, Scaling-Aware Patching leverages an instruction-conditioned gating mechanism to generate variable-size patches over structural graphs, adaptively scaling the query token budget with structural complexity to mitigate fixed-length connector bottlenecks. Second, Geometry Grounding Adapter refines these adaptive tokens via cross-attention to modality embeddings and injects the resulting modality tokens into the LLM, exposing explicit geometric cues to reduce structural hallucination. Experiments across diverse all-atom benchmarks demonstrate that Cuttlefish achieves superior performance in heterogeneous structure-grounded reasoning.

The approach couples data, model beliefs, and physics/structure priors through dimension-aware information budgeting, adaptive bootstrapped distillation over a heterogeneous surrogate reservoir, and structure-aware candidate manifold analysis with Kalman-inspired multi-model fusion to balance consensus-driven exploitation and disagreement-driven exploration. Evaluated under a single unified protocol without dataset-specific tuning, the framework improves sample efficiency and reliability across 14 single- and multi-objective materials design tasks spanning candidate pools from $600$ to $4 \\times 10^6$ and feature dimensions from $10$ to $10^3$, typically reaching top-performing regions within 100 evaluations.

Experiments on five public datasets show improvements of up to \\textbf{6.9\\%} in AUC, \\textbf{20.3\\%} in accuracy, and \\textbf{2.3\\%} in C-index, establishing MARBLE as an efficient and generalizable framework for multi-scale WSI analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "MARBLE\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eMamba\u7684\u7eaf\u591a\u5934\u591a\u72b6\u6001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5168\u5207\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u5904\u7406\u591a\u653e\u5927\u7ea7\u522b\u548ccoarse-to-fine\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u6355\u6349\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u57285\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0aAUC\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe6.9%\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534720.3%\uff0cC-index\u63d0\u53472.3%", "motivation": "\u5168\u5207\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u9762\u4e34\u5343\u5146\u50cf\u7d20\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u653e\u5927\u500d\u7387\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u73b0\u6709MIL\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u5728\u5355\u4e00\u5c3a\u5ea6\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u800c\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e8c\u6b21\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMARBLE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7eafMamba-based\u7684\u591a\u72b6\u6001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u884c\u5904\u7406\u591a\u4e2a\u653e\u5927\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210coarse-to-fine\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u53c2\u6570\u5f00\u9500\u6355\u6349\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMARBLE\u5728AUC\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u9ad8\u8fbe6.9%\uff0c\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u534720.3%\uff0cC-index\u63d0\u53472.3%\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18", "conclusion": "MARBLE\u4e3a\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6WSI\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e76\u884c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5904\u7406\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5f3a\u7684\u5168\u5207\u7247\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790"}}

We demonstrate that PPL is a deceptive metric in context-stabilized regimes (L=128). Using a rigorous sliding-window protocol (N=1500), we identify a novel failure mode termed \"Semantic Tunneling.\" While the Baseline model maintains high grammatical fluency (PPL approx. 83.9), it suffers a catastrophic loss of semantic diversity, converging within seven generations to a single, low-entropy narrative attractor: the \"Robert Boulton\" Singularity. This phenomenon represents a total collapse of the latent manifold (Global Effective Rank 3.62 -> 2.22), where the model discards diverse world knowledge to optimize for statistically safe syntactic templates. To address this, we apply the Multi-Scale Negative Coupled Information Systems (MNCIS) framework recently established in Hou (2026) [arXiv:2601.11594]. We demonstrate that Adaptive Spectral Negative Coupling (ASNC) acts as a topological operator that actively induces \"Manifold Unfolding.\" MNCIS forces the model to expand its effective rank from the anisotropic baseline of 3.62 to a hyper-diverse state of 5.35, effectively constructing an \"Artificial Manifold\" that resists the gravitational pull of semantic attractors and preserves the long-tail distribution of the training data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u9012\u5f52\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0cPerplexity\u6307\u6807\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a33\u5b9a\u65f6\u7684\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3a\u201c\u8bed\u4e49\u96a7\u9053\u201d\u7684\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MNCIS\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7ASNC\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b9e\u73b0\u201c\u6d41\u5f62\u5c55\u5f00\u201d\u4ee5\u5bf9\u6297\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e38\u89c4\u7684Perplexity\u6307\u6807\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u8bef\u5bfc\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u4e27\u5931\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63ed\u793a\u8fd9\u79cd\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u7ef4\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u534f\u8bae\uff08N=1500\uff09\u5206\u6790\u9012\u5f52\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u201c\u8bed\u4e49\u96a7\u9053\u201d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8d1f\u8026\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08MNCIS\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c31\u8d1f\u8026\u5408\uff08ASNC\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u62d3\u6251\u64cd\u4f5c\u7b26\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u201c\u6d41\u5f62\u5c55\u5f00\u201d\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u51c6\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u9ad8\u8bed\u6cd5\u6d41\u7545\u6027\uff08PPL\u7ea683.9\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e03\u4ee3\u5185\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5c31\u707e\u96be\u6027\u4e27\u5931\uff0c\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5355\u4e00\u4f4e\u71b5\u53d9\u4e8b\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\uff08Robert Boulton\u5947\u70b9\uff09\u3002MNCIS\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5c06\u6709\u6548\u79e9\u4ece\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u76843.62\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u8d85\u591a\u6837\u6027\u76845.35\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u62b5\u6297\u8bed\u4e49\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\u5f15\u529b\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u201c\u4eba\u5de5\u6d41\u5f62\u201d\u3002", "conclusion": "Perplexity\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u68c0\u6d4b\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\u3002MNCIS\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684ASNC\u64cd\u4f5c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5bf9\u6297\u201c\u8bed\u4e49\u96a7\u9053\u201d\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d41\u5f62\u5c55\u5f00\u7ef4\u6301\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

The reason being that synthetic and real medical images exist in different semantic feature spaces, creating a domain gap that current semi-supervised learning methods cannot bridge. We propose SRA-Seg, a framework explicitly designed to align synthetic and real feature distributions for medical image segmentation. SRA-Seg introduces a similarity-alignment (SA) loss using frozen DINOv2 embeddings to pull synthetic representations toward their nearest real counterparts in semantic space. We employ soft edge blending to create smooth anatomical transitions and continuous labels, eliminating the hard boundaries from traditional copy-paste augmentation. The framework generates pseudo-labels for synthetic images via an EMA teacher model and applies soft-segmentation losses that respect uncertainty in mixed regions. Our experiments demonstrate strong results: using only 10% labeled real data and 90% synthetic unlabeled data, SRA-Seg achieves 89.34% Dice on ACDC and 84.42% on FIVES, significantly outperforming existing semi-supervised methods and matching the performance of methods using real unlabeled data.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing Electronic Design Automation (EDA) methods typically frame sizing as static black-box optimization, resulting in inefficient and less robust solutions. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit strong reasoning abilities, they are not suited for precise numerical optimization in AMS sizing. To address this gap, we propose AutoSizer, a reflective LLM-driven meta-optimization framework that unifies circuit understanding, adaptive search-space construction, and optimization orchestration in a closed loop. It employs a two-loop optimization framework, with an inner loop for circuit sizing and an outer loop that analyzes optimization dynamics and constraints to iteratively refine the search space from simulation feedback. We further introduce AMS-SizingBench, an open benchmark comprising 24 diverse AMS circuits in SKY130 CMOS technology, designed to evaluate adaptive optimization policies under realistic simulator-based constraints. AutoSizer experimentally achieves higher solution quality, faster convergence, and higher success rate across varying circuit difficulties, outperforming both traditional optimization methods and existing LLM-based agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, most existing work focuses exclusively on capturing spatio-temporal dependencies from historical traffic data, while overlooking the fact that suddenly occurring transportation incidents, such as traffic accidents and adverse weather, serve as external disturbances that can substantially alter temporal patterns. We argue that this issue has become a major obstacle to modeling the dynamics of traffic systems and improving prediction accuracy, but the unpredictability of incidents makes it difficult to observe patterns from historical sequences. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework named the Incident-Guided Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (IGSTGNN). IGSTGNN explicitly models the incident's impact through two core components: an Incident-Context Spatial Fusion (ICSF) module to capture the initial heterogeneous spatial influence, and a Temporal Incident Impact Decay (TIID) module to model the subsequent dynamic dissipation. To facilitate research on the spatio-temporal impact of incidents on traffic flow, a large-scale dataset is constructed and released, featuring incident records that are time-aligned with traffic time series. On this new benchmark, the proposed IGSTGNN framework is demonstrated to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, the generalizability of the ICSF and TIID modules is validated by integrating them into various existing models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing pruning methods demonstrate excellent performance preservation in visual question answering (VQA) and suffer substantial degradation on visual grounding (VG) tasks. Our analysis of the VLM's processing pipeline reveals that strategies utilizing global semantic similarity and attention scores lose the global spatial reference frame, which is derived from the interactions of tokens' positional information. Motivated by these findings, we propose $\\text{N\u00fcwa}$, a two-stage token pruning framework that enables efficient feature aggregation while maintaining spatial integrity. In the first stage, after the vision encoder, we apply three operations, namely separation, alignment, and aggregation, which are inspired by swarm intelligence algorithms to retain information-rich global spatial anchors. In the second stage, within the LLM, we perform text-guided pruning to retain task-relevant visual tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $\\text{N\u00fcwa}$ achieves SOTA performance on multiple VQA benchmarks (from 94% to 95%) and yields substantial improvements on visual grounding tasks (from 7% to 47%).", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Unfortunately, this determinism can unintentionally expose timing information that enables adversaries to infer task execution patterns and carry out timing-based attacks targeting safety-critical control tasks. While prior defenses aim to obscure schedules through randomization or isolation, they typically neglect the implications of such modifications on closed-loop control behavior and real-time feasibility. This work studies the problem of securing real-time control workloads against timing inference attacks while explicitly accounting for both schedulability constraints and control performance requirements. We present a scheduling-based mitigation approach that introduces bounded timing perturbations to control task executions in a structured manner, reducing adversarial opportunities without violating real-time guarantees. The framework jointly considers worst-case execution behavior and the impact of execution delays on control performance, enabling the system to operate within predefined safety and performance limits. Through experimental evaluation on representative task sets and control scenarios, the proposed approach demonstrates that exposure to timing-based attacks can be significantly reduced while preserving predictable execution and acceptable control quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This limitation is particularly problematic in ordinal decision settings such as clinical triage, where standard alignment removes the ability to trade off specificity and sensitivity (the ROC operating point) based on contextual constraints. We propose STEER (Steerable Tuning via Evolutionary Ensemble Refinement), a training-free framework that reintroduces this tunable control. STEER constructs a population of natural-language personas through an offline, constrained quality-diversity search that promotes behavioral coverage while enforcing minimum safety, reasoning, and stability thresholds. At inference time, STEER exposes a single, interpretable control parameter that maps a user-specified risk percentile to a selected persona, yielding a monotonic adjustment of decision conservativeness. On two clinical triage benchmarks, STEER achieves broader behavioral coverage compared to temperature-based sampling and static persona ensembles. Compared to a representative post-training method, STEER maintains substantially higher accuracy on unambiguous urgent cases while providing comparable control over ambiguous decisions. These results demonstrate STEER as a safety-preserving paradigm for risk control, capable of steering behavior without compromising domain competence.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Deploying RL in real-world settings, especially in the context of human-robot interaction, requires defining state representations and reward functions, which are critical for learning efficiency and policy performance. Traditional RL approaches often rely on domain expertise and trial-and-error, necessitating extensive human involvement as well as direct interaction with the environment, which can be costly and impractical, especially in complex and safety-critical applications. This work proposes a novel RL framework that leverages off-policy evaluation (OPE) for state space and reward function selection, using only logged interaction data. This approach eliminates the need for real-time access to the environment or human-in-the-loop feedback, greatly reducing the dependency on costly real-time interactions. The proposed approach systematically evaluates multiple candidate state representations and reward functions by training offline RL agents and applying OPE to estimate policy performance. The optimal state space and reward function are selected based on their ability to produce high-performing policies under OPE metrics. Our method is validated on two environments: the Lunar Lander environment by OpenAI Gym, which provides a controlled setting for assessing state space and reward function selection, and a NASA-MATB-II human subjects study environment, which evaluates the approach's real-world applicability to human-robot teaming scenarios.

Here, we demonstrate a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)- based active flow control strategy to control unstart in a canonical two-dimensional hypersonic inlet at Mach 5 and Reynolds number $5\\times 10^6$. The in-house CFD solver enables high-fidelity simulations with adaptive mesh refinement, resolving key flow features, including shock motion, boundary-layer dynamics, and flow separation, that are essential for learning physically consistent control policies suitable for real-time deployment. The DRL controller robustly stabilizes the inlet over a wide range of back pressures representative of varying combustion chamber conditions. It further generalizes to previously unseen scenarios, including different back-pressure levels, Reynolds numbers, and sensor configurations, while operating with noisy measurements, thereby demonstrating strong zero-shot generalization. Control remains robust in the presence of noisy sensor measurements, and a minimal, optimally selected sensor set achieves comparable performance, enabling practical implementation.

We then propose BenchAlign, the first solution to this problem, which learns preference-aligned weight- ings for benchmark questions using the question-level performance of language models alongside ranked pairs of models that could be collected during deployment, producing new benchmarks that rank previously unseen models according to these preferences. Our experiments show that our aligned benchmarks can accurately rank unseen models according to models of human preferences, even across different sizes, while remaining interpretable.

However, existing diffusion-based RL methods primarily focus on offline settings for reward maximization, with limited consideration of safety in online settings. To address this gap, we propose Augmented Lagrangian-Guided Diffusion (ALGD), a novel algorithm for off-policy safe RL. By revisiting optimization theory and energy-based model, we show that the instability of primal-dual methods arises from the non-convex Lagrangian landscape. In diffusion-based safe RL, the Lagrangian can be interpreted as an energy function guiding the denoising dynamics. Counterintuitively, direct usage destabilizes both policy generation and training. ALGD resolves this issue by introducing an augmented Lagrangian that locally convexifies the energy landscape, yielding a stabilized policy generation and training process without altering the distribution of the optimal policy. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that ALGD is both theoretically grounded and empirically effective, achieving strong and stable performance across diverse environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u589e\u5f3a\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08ALGD\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u589e\u5f3a\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6700\u5927\u5316\uff0c\u5bf9\u5728\u7ebf\u8bbe\u7f6e\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8003\u8651\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4e14\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u975e\u51f8\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u666f\u89c2\u4e2d\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "ALGD\u7b97\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u80fd\u91cf\u57fa\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u589e\u5f3a\u62c9\u683c\u6717\u65e5\u51fd\u6570\u5c40\u90e8\u51f8\u5316\u80fd\u91cf\u666f\u89c2\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eALGD\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u4e14\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "ALGD\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7a33\u5b9a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7b56\u7565\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

To adaptively experience Mixed Reality (MR) content based on each user's space, it is essential to generate a 3D scene that reflects the real-world layout by compactly capturing the semantic cues of the surroundings. Prior works struggled to fully capture the contextual relationship between objects or mainly focused on synthesizing diverse shapes, making it challenging to generate 3D scenes aligned with object arrangements. We address these challenges by designing a graph network with cross-check feature attention for scene graph prediction and constructing a graph-variational autoencoder (graph-VAE), which consists of a joint shape and layout block for 3D scene generation. Experiments on the 3RScan/3DSSG and SG-FRONT datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, even in complex indoor environments and under challenging scene graph constraints.

We propose MA2B-DDQN, a human-centric multi-agent action-branching double Deep Q-Network (DQN) framework that explicitly optimizes traveler-level equity. Our key contribution is an action-branching discrete control formulation that decomposes corridor control into (i) local, per-intersection actions that allocate green time between the next two phases and (ii) a single global action that selects the total duration of those phases. This decomposition enables scalable coordination under discrete control while reducing the effective complexity of joint decision-making. We also design a human-centric reward that penalizes the number of delayed individuals in the corridor, accounting for pedestrians, vehicle occupants, and transit passengers. Extensive evaluations across seven realistic traffic scenarios in Melbourne, Australia, demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the number of impacted travelers, outperforming existing DRL and baseline methods. Experiments confirm the robustness of our model, showing minimal variance across diverse settings.

Existing benchmarks face a trade-off: they either heavily rely on LLM-as-judge evaluations of automatically generated research outputs or optimize convenient yet isolated performance metrics that provide coarse proxies for scientific insight. To address this gap, we introduce FIRE-Bench (Full-cycle Insight Rediscovery Evaluation), a benchmark that evaluates agents through the rediscovery of established findings from recent, high-impact machine learning research. Agents are given only a high-level research question extracted from a published, verified study and must autonomously explore ideas, design experiments, implement code, execute their plans, and derive conclusions supported by empirical evidence. We evaluate a range of state-of-the-art agents with frontier LLMs backbones like gpt-5 on FIRE-Bench. Our results show that full-cycle scientific research remains challenging for current agent systems: even the strongest agents achieve limited rediscovery success (<50 F1), exhibit high variance across runs, and display recurring failure modes in experimental design, execution, and evidence-based reasoning. FIRE-Bench provides a rigorous and diagnostic framework for measuring progress toward reliable agent-driven scientific discovery.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Despite the success of textual safety moderation, its multimodal counterparts remain hindered by a dual sparsity of data and supervision. Conventional reliance on binary labels lead to shortcut learning, which obscures the intrinsic classification boundaries necessary for effective multimodal discrimination. Hence, we propose a novel learning paradigm (UniMod) that transitions from sparse decision-making to dense reasoning traces. By constructing structured trajectories encompassing evidence grounding, modality assessment, risk mapping, policy decision, and response generation, we reformulate monolithic decision tasks into a multi-dimensional boundary learning process. This approach forces the model to ground its decision in explicit safety semantics, preventing the model from converging on superficial shortcuts. To facilitate this paradigm, we develop a multi-head scalar reward model (UniRM). UniRM provides multi-dimensional supervision by assigning attribute-level scores to the response generation stage. Furthermore, we introduce specialized optimization strategies to decouple task-specific parameters and rebalance training dynamics, effectively resolving interference between diverse objectives in multi-task learning. Empirical results show UniMod achieves competitive textual moderation performance and sets a new multimodal benchmark using less than 40\\% of the training data used by leading baselines. Ablations further validate our multi-attribute trajectory reasoning, offering an effective and efficient framework for multimodal moderation.

Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires hierarchical semantics capturing both global context and localized details across visual and textual domains. Yet linguistic hierarchies from syntax or semantics rarely match visual organization, and purely visual hierarchies tend to fragment scenes into appearance-driven parts without semantic focus. We propose CAFT (Cross-domain Alignment of Forests and Trees), a hierarchical image-text representation learning framework that aligns global and local semantics across images and long captions without pixel-level supervision. Coupling a fine-to-coarse visual encoder with a hierarchical text transformer, it uses a hierarchical alignment loss that matches whole images with whole captions while biasing region-sentence correspondences, so that coarse semantics are built from fine-grained evidence rather than from aggregation untethered to part-level grounding. Trained on 30M image-text pairs, CAFT achieves state-of-the-art performance on six long-text retrieval benchmarks and exhibits strong scaling behavior. Experiments show that hierarchical cross-domain alignment enables fine-grained, visually grounded image-text representations to emerge without explicit region-level supervision.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

By extending the bounded attention prefix oracle (BAPO) model--an abstraction of LLMs that quantifies the information flow required to solve a task--we prove lower bounds on the CoT tokens required for three canonical BAPO-hard tasks: binary majority, triplet matching, and graph reachability. We show that each requires $\u03a9(n)$ reasoning tokens when the input size is $n$. We complement these results with matching or near-matching upper bounds via explicit constructions. Finally, our experiments with frontier reasoning models show approximately linear reasoning token scaling on these tasks and failures when constrained to smaller reasoning budgets, consistent with our theoretical lower bounds.

To overcome these issues, we propose Future-Aware Quantization (FAQ), which leverages future-layer activations to guide quantization. This allows better identification and preservation of important weights, while reducing sensitivity to calibration noise. We further introduce a window-wise preview mechanism to softly aggregate multiple future-layer activations, mitigating over-reliance on any single layer. To avoid expensive greedy search, we use a pre-searched configuration to minimize overhead.

Recent progress in Gaussian-based representations has significantly improved real-time rendering quality, yet existing methods still struggle to maintain a balance between long-term static and short-term dynamic regions in both representation and optimization. To address this, we present SharpTimeGS, a lifespan-aware 4D Gaussian framework that achieves temporally adaptive modeling of both static and dynamic regions under a unified representation. Specifically, we introduce a learnable lifespan parameter that reformulates temporal visibility from a Gaussian-shaped decay into a flat-top profile, allowing primitives to remain consistently active over their intended duration and avoiding redundant densification. In addition, the learned lifespan modulates each primitives' motion, reducing drift in long-lived static points while retaining unrestricted motion for short-lived dynamic ones. This effectively decouples motion magnitude from temporal duration, improving long-term stability without compromising dynamic fidelity. Moreover, we design a lifespan-velocity-aware densification strategy that mitigates optimization imbalance between static and dynamic regions by allocating more capacity to regions with pronounced motion while keeping static areas compact and stable. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while supporting real-time rendering up to 4K resolution at 100 FPS on one RTX 4090.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Represented by DeepSeek-OCR, these models encode rendered text into continuous vision tokens, achieving high compression rates without sacrificing recognition precision. However, viewing the vision encoder as a lossy channel with finite representational capacity raises a fundamental question: what is the information upper bound of visual tokens? To investigate this limit, we conduct controlled stress tests by progressively increasing the information quantity (character count) within an image. We observe a distinct phase-transition phenomenon characterized by three regimes: a near-perfect Stable Phase, an Instability Phase marked by increased error variance, and a total Collapse Phase.

The system selects the minimum-cost fidelity maximizing expected utility given predicted accuracy and retrieval costs. We evaluate VOILA across three deployment scenarios using five datasets (VQA-v2, GQA, TextVQA, LoCoMo, FloodNet) and six Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with 7B-235B parameters.

Among existing methods, the Locate-and-Edit (L&E) paradigm is the dominant framework: it locates MLP parameters implicated in expressing a target fact, and then performs a localized update to rewrite that fact. However, long sequences of edits often trigger abrupt model collapse in L&E beyond a critical point. We empirically identify a strong correlation between collapse and explosive growth of edited MLP weight norms, and formally prove that commonly used L&E update rules can induce exponential norm growth across sequential edits in the absence of explicit norm control. To address this issue, we propose Norm-Anchor Scaling NAS, a plug-and-play norm-constrained strategy. Across extensive experiments, NAS delays the collapse point of representative L&E algorithms by more than 4 times and yields a 72.2% average relative gain in editing performance, requiring only a single additional line of code and incurring negligible computational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Norm-Anchor Scaling (NAS)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u6743\u91cd\u8303\u6570\u6765\u89e3\u51b3Locate-and-Edit\u6a21\u578b\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709Locate-and-Edit\u8303\u5f0f\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u7f16\u8f91\u65f6\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5d29\u6e83\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e0eMLP\u6743\u91cd\u8303\u6570\u7206\u70b8\u6027\u589e\u957f\u6709\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\u6027", "method": "\u63d0\u51faNAS\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u8303\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u7f16\u8f91\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u6743\u91cd\u8303\u6570\u7a33\u5b9a", "result": "NAS\u5c06\u5d29\u6e83\u70b9\u5ef6\u8fdf4\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u7f16\u8f91\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u534772.2%\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u4e00\u884c\u989d\u5916\u4ee3\u7801\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565", "conclusion": "NAS\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8303\u6570\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86Locate-and-Edit\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b"}}

Recent studies intuitively identify the high-frequency structure and low-frequency texture to be extracted by CNNs from the encoder, and subsequently for a desirable upsampling recovery. However, the existing arts inevitably overlook the information loss for both structure and texture feature maps during the convolutional downsampling process, hence suffer from a non-ideal upsampling output. In this paper, we systematically answer whether and how the structure and texture feature map can mutually help to alleviate the information loss during the convolutional downsampling. Given the structure and texture feature maps, we adopt the statistical normalization and denormalization strategy for the reconstruction guidance during the convolutional downsampling process.

Existing DLM caching approaches reduce this cost by selective hidden state updates; however, they are still limited by (i) costly token-wise update identification heuristics and (ii) rigid, uniform budget allocation that fails to account for heterogeneous hidden state dynamics. To address these challenges, we present SPA-Cache that jointly optimizes update identification and budget allocation in DLM cache. First, we derive a low-dimensional singular proxy that enables the identification of update-critical tokens in a low-dimensional subspace, substantially reducing the overhead of update identification. Second, we introduce an adaptive strategy that allocates fewer updates to stable layers without degrading generation quality.

We benchmark 20+ LLMs against a matched human baseline on 11 causal judgment tasks formalized by a collider structure ($C_1 \\!\\rightarrow\\! E\\! \\leftarrow \\!C_2$). We find that a small interpretable model compresses LLMs' causal judgments well and that most LLMs exhibit more rule-like reasoning strategies than humans who seem to account for unmentioned latent factors in their probability judgments. Furthermore, most LLMs do not mirror the characteristic human collider biases of weak explaining away and Markov violations. We probe LLMs' causal judgment robustness under (i) semantic abstraction and (ii) prompt overloading (injecting irrelevant text), and find that chain-of-thought (CoT) increases robustness for many LLMs. Together, this divergence suggests LLMs can complement humans when known biases are undesirable, but their rule-like reasoning may break down when uncertainty is intrinsic -- highlighting the need to characterize LLM reasoning strategies for safe, effective deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5bf920\u591a\u4e2a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u572811\u4e2a\u56e0\u679c\u5224\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0LLMs\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u66f4\u52a0\u89c4\u5219\u5316\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f46\u6ca1\u6709\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4eba\u7c7b\u7279\u6709\u7684\u78b0\u649e\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u8fc7\u8f7d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9700\u8981\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u660e\u786e\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5224\u65ad\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c4\u8303\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u4eba\u7c7b\u5f0f\u6377\u5f84\u8fd8\u662f\u8106\u5f31\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u5c0620\u591a\u4e2aLLMs\u4e0e\u5339\u914d\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u57fa\u51c6\u572811\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u78b0\u649e\u7ed3\u6784\uff08C\u2081\u2192E\u2190C\u2082\uff09\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5224\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29LLMs\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u8fc7\u8f7d\u4e24\u79cd\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u591a\u6570LLMs\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6bd4\u4eba\u7c7b\u66f4\u52a0\u89c4\u5219\u5316\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u672a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u5f31\u89e3\u91ca\u6392\u4ed6\u548c\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8fdd\u80cc\u7b49\u78b0\u649e\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bb8\u591aLLMs\u5bf9\u8bed\u4e49\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u8fc7\u8f7d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u89c1\u4e0d\u53ef\u53d6\u65f6\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u8865\u5145\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u89c4\u5219\u5316\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u672c\u8d28\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65f6\u53ef\u80fd\u5931\u6548\uff0c\u8fd9\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7b56\u7565\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5b89\u5168\u6709\u6548\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

However, recent studies question whether RL genuinely expands reasoning capacity or merely aligns existing latent capabilities, arguing that exploration remains confined within the pre-trained model's low-rank bias manifold. In this work, we challenge this accessibility boundary hypothesis by demonstrating that the latent reasoning space can be fundamentally expanded through targeted geometric interventions. We propose Manifold-Reshaping Policy Optimization (MRPO), a geometric framework designed to fundamentally restructure the inference space of LLMs. MRPO operates in two stages: first, we employ Spectral Orthogonal Exploration (SOE) to eject the policy initialization into the null space of the bias manifold; second, we integrate an Effective Rank regularization term into the policy optimization objective. This approach incentivizes the discovery and maintenance of high-dimensional reasoning trajectories against the entropy-reducing tendency of standard RL. Empirically, our 4B-parameter method achieves state-of-the-art performance on mathematical tasks, significantly outperforming larger models (e.g., Qwen3-32B) and expanding the capability boundary beyond standard GRPO.

We address this challenge by formulating storytelling as a closed-loop constraint enforcement problem and propose MUSE, a multi-agent framework that coordinates generation through an iterative plan-execute-verify-revise loop. MUSE translates narrative intent into explicit, machine-executable controls over identity, spatial composition, and temporal continuity, and applies targeted multimodal feedback to correct violations during generation.

We further validate the proposed model through two controlled experiments: a random-generation task demonstrating constrained planning under human prompts and increasing planning strength as self-generated context accumulates, and a Gaussian-sampling task showing reduced initial bias when conditioning on self-generated sequences.

Weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ) is appealing, as it reduces memory usage and enables practical speedup without low-bit operators or specialized hardware. However, accuracy often degrades significantly in weight-only PTQ at sub-4-bit precision, and our analysis identifies two main causes: (1) down-projection matrices are a well-known quantization bottleneck, but maintaining their fidelity often requires extra bit-width; (2) weight quantization induces activation deviations, but effective correction strategies remain underexplored. To address these issues, we propose D$^2$Quant, a novel weight-only PTQ framework that improves quantization from both the weight and activation perspectives. On the weight side, we design a Dual-Scale Quantizer (DSQ) tailored to down-projection matrices, with an absorbable scaling factor that significantly improves accuracy without increasing the bit budget. On the activation side, we propose Deviation-Aware Correction (DAC), which incorporates a mean-shift correction within LayerNorm to mitigate quantization-induced activation distribution shifts. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM families and evaluation metrics show that D$^2$Quant delivers superior performance for weight-only PTQ at sub-4-bit precision.

A significant challenge, however, is their prohibitive inference cost when processing high-resolution visual inputs. While visual token pruning has emerged as a promising solution, existing methods that primarily focus on semantic relevance often discard tokens that are crucial for spatial reasoning. We address this gap through a novel insight into \\emph{how LVLMs process spatial reasoning}. Specifically, we reveal that LVLMs implicitly establish visual coordinate systems through Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE), where specific token positions serve as \\textbf{implicit visual coordinates} (IVC tokens) that are essential for spatial reasoning. Based on this insight, we propose \\textbf{IVC-Prune}, a training-free, prompt-aware pruning strategy that retains both IVC tokens and semantically relevant foreground tokens. IVC tokens are identified by theoretically analyzing the mathematical properties of RoPE, targeting positions at which its rotation matrices approximate identity matrix or the $90^\\circ$ rotation matrix. Foreground tokens are identified through a robust two-stage process: semantic seed discovery followed by contextual refinement via value-vector similarity. Extensive evaluations across four representative LVLMs and twenty diverse benchmarks show that IVC-Prune reduces visual tokens by approximately 50\\% while maintaining $\\geq$ 99\\% of the original performance and even achieving improvements on several benchmarks.

STAR holistically synergizes these strategies within a cohesive training curriculum, enabling super-tiny models to achieve exceptional performance on complex function calling tasks; (2) Similarity-guided RL (Sim-RL), a RL mechanism that introduces a fine-grained, similarity-based reward. This provides a robust, continuous, and rich signal for better policy optimization by evaluating the similarity between generated outputs and the ground truth. Extensive experiments on challenging and renowned benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our STAR models establish SOTA in their size classes, significantly outperforming baselines.

Recent approaches tackle this task by utilizing Gaussian-based temporal proposals to represent query-relevant segments. However, their inference strategies rely on heuristic mappings from Gaussian parameters to segment boundaries, resulting in suboptimal localization performance. To address this issue, we propose Gaussian Boundary Optimization (GBO), a novel inference framework that predicts segment boundaries by solving a principled optimization problem that balances proposal coverage and segment compactness. We derive a closed-form solution for this problem and rigorously analyze the optimality conditions under varying penalty regimes. Beyond its theoretical foundations, GBO offers several practical advantages: it is training-free and compatible with both single-Gaussian and mixture-based proposal architectures. Our experiments show that GBO significantly improves localization, achieving state-of-the-art results across standard benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and generalizability of GBO across various proposal schemes.

A common recipe, SFT followed by GRPO, can stall when within-group reward variation is low (e.g., more rollouts in a group receive the all 0 or all 1 reward), making the group-normalized advantage uninformative and yielding vanishing updates. To address this problem, we propose RC-GRPO (Reward-Conditioned Group Relative Policy Optimization), which treats exploration as a controllable steering problem via discrete reward tokens. We first fine-tune a Reward-Conditioned Trajectory Policy (RCTP) on mixed-quality trajectories with reward goal special tokens (e.g., <|high_reward|>, <|low_reward|>) injected into the prompts, enabling the model to learn how to generate distinct quality trajectories on demand. Then during RL, we sample diverse reward tokens within each GRPO group and condition rollouts on the sampled token to improve within-group diversity, improving advantage gains.

The semantic similarity between the original and reconstructed code serves as an implicit reward, enabling reinforcement learning to improve the model's performance both in generating code from documentation and vice versa. This approach allows models to be trained using only code, substantially increasing the available training examples. Evaluated on HumanEval and MBPP with a 7B model, BatCoder achieved 83.5% and 81.0% pass@1, outperforming strong open-source baselines.

However, most existing models remain task-specific, annotation-dependent, and limited in generalizability across diseases and anatomical regions. Although a generalizable foundation model trained on large-scale musculoskeletal radiographs is clinically needed, publicly available datasets remain limited in size and lack sufficient diversity to enable training across a wide range of musculoskeletal conditions and anatomical sites. Here, we present SKELEX, a large-scale foundation model for musculoskeletal radiographs, trained using self-supervised learning on 1.2 million diverse, condition-rich images. The model was evaluated on 12 downstream diagnostic tasks and generally outperformed baselines in fracture detection, osteoarthritis grading, and bone tumor classification.

With recent large-scale foundation models showing strong zero-shot performance on downstream tasks including classification and segmentation, there has been interest in using the internal feature maps of these models for the semantic correspondence task. Recent works observe that features from DINOv2 and Stable Diffusion (SD) are complementary, the former producing accurate but sparse correspondences, while the latter produces spatially consistent correspondences. As a result, current state-of-the-art methods for semantic correspondence involve combining features from both models in an ensemble. While the performance of these methods is impressive, they are computationally expensive, requiring evaluating feature maps from large-scale foundation models. In this work we take a different approach, instead replacing SD features with a superior matching algorithm which is imbued with the desirable spatial consistency property. Specifically, we replace the standard nearest neighbours matching with an optimal transport algorithm that includes a Gromov Wasserstein spatial smoothness prior. We show that we can significantly boost the performance of the DINOv2 baseline, and be competitive and sometimes surpassing state-of-the-art methods using Stable Diffusion features, while being 5--10x more efficient.

Process verification, which evaluates intermediate steps in trajectories, has shown promise in general reasoning settings, and has been suggested as a potential tool for guiding coordination of MAS; however, its actual effectiveness in MAS remains unclear. To fill this gap, we present MAS-ProVe, a systematic empirical study of process verification for multi-agent systems (MAS). Our study spans three verification paradigms (LLM-as-a-Judge, reward models, and process reward models), evaluated across two levels of verification granularity (agent-level and iteration-level). We further examine five representative verifiers and four context management strategies, and conduct experiments over six diverse MAS frameworks on multiple reasoning benchmarks. We find that process-level verification does not consistently improve performance and frequently exhibits high variance, highlighting the difficulty of reliably evaluating partial multi-agent trajectories. Among the methods studied, LLM-as-a-Judge generally outperforms reward-based approaches, with trained judges surpassing general-purpose LLMs. We further observe a small performance gap between LLMs acting as judges and as single agents, and identify a context-length-performance trade-off in verification. Overall, our results suggest that effective and robust process verification for MAS remains an open challenge, requiring further advances beyond current paradigms.

In this work, we study the cross-modality transfer of jailbreak attacks from text to audio, motivated by the semantic similarity between the two modalities and the maturity of textual jailbreak methods. We first analyze the connection between modality alignment and cross-modality jailbreak transfer, showing that strong alignment can inadvertently propagate textual vulnerabilities to the audio modality, which we term the alignment curse. Guided by this analysis, we conduct an empirical evaluation of textual jailbreaks, text-transferred audio jailbreaks, and existing audio-based jailbreaks on recent omni-models. Our results show that text-transferred audio jailbreaks perform comparably to, and often better than, audio-based jailbreaks, establishing them as simple yet powerful baselines for future audio red-teaming.

To address these challenges, We propose JobRec, a generative job recommendation framework for de-conflating preference and qualification via constrained dual-perspective reasoning. JobRec introduces a Unified Semantic Alignment Schema that aligns candidate and job attributes into structured semantic layers, and a Two-Stage Cooperative Training Strategy that learns decoupled experts to separately infer preference and qualification. Building on these experts, a Lagrangian-based Policy Alignment module optimizes recommendations under explicit eligibility requirements, enabling controllable trade-offs.

To facilitate PA-MIL in learning phenotype-aware features, we 1) construct a phenotype knowledge base containing cancer-related phenotypes and their associated genotypes. 2) utilize the morphological descriptions of phenotypes as language prompting to aggregate phenotype-related features. 3) devise the Genotype-to-Phenotype Neural Network (GP-NN) grounded in genotype-to-phenotype relationships, which provides multi-level guidance for PA-MIL. Experimental results on multiple datasets demonstrate that PA-MIL achieves competitive performance compared to existing MIL methods while offering improved interpretability. PA-MIL leverages phenotype saliency as evidence and, using a linear classifier, achieves competitive results compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Because of these challenges the task is underdetermined, where there exists multiple -- possibly infinite -- poses that are plausible given the image. Despite this, many prior works assume the existence of a deterministic mapping and estimate a single pose given an image. Furthermore, methods based on machine learning require a large amount of paired 2D-3D data to train and suffer from generalization issues to unseen scenarios. To address both of these issues, we propose a framework for pose estimation using diffusion models, which enables sampling from a probability distribution over plausible poses which are consistent with a 2D image. Our approach falls under the guidance framework for conditional generation, and guides samples from an unconditional diffusion model, trained only on 3D data, using the gradients of the heatmaps from a 2D keypoint detector. We evaluate our method on the Human 3.6M dataset under best-of-$m$ multiple hypothesis evaluation, showing state-of-the-art performance among methods which do not require paired 2D-3D data for training. We additionally evaluate the generalization ability using the MPI-INF-3DHP and 3DPW datasets and demonstrate competitive performance.

These frameworks impose distinct architectural structures that govern how agents interact, store information, and coordinate tasks. However, their impact on system performance remains poorly understood. This gap is critical, as architectural choices alone can induce order-of-magnitude differences in latency and throughput, as well as substantial variation in accuracy and scalability. Addressing this challenge requires (i) jointly evaluating multiple capabilities, such as orchestration overhead, memory behavior, planning, specialization, and coordination, and (ii) conducting these evaluations under controlled, framework-level conditions to isolate architectural effects. Existing benchmarks focus on individual capabilities and lack standardized framework-level evaluation. We address these limitations by (i) introducing an architectural taxonomy for systematically comparing multi-agent LLM frameworks along fundamental dimensions, and (ii) developing MAFBench, a unified evaluation suite that integrates existing benchmarks under a standardized execution pipeline. Using MAFBench, we conduct a controlled empirical study across several widely used frameworks. Our results show that framework-level design choices alone can increase latency by over 100x, reduce planning accuracy by up to 30%, and lower coordination success from above 90% to below 30%.

However, these models frequently exhibit suboptimal performance when spatiotemporal discrepancies exist between inputs and labels, for instance, when nodes with similar time-series inputs manifest distinct future labels, or vice versa. To address this limitation, we propose explicitly incorporating label features during the training phase. Specifically, we introduce the Spatiotemporal Residual Theorem, which generalizes the conventional unidirectional spatiotemporal prediction paradigm into a bidirectional learning framework. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we design an universal module, termed ReLearner, which seamlessly augments Spatiotemporal Neural Networks (STNNs) with a bidirectional learning capability via an auxiliary inverse learning process. In this process, the model relearns the spatiotemporal feature residuals between input data and future data. The proposed ReLearner comprises two critical components: (1) a Residual Learning Module, designed to effectively disentangle spatiotemporal feature discrepancies between input and label representations; and (2) a Residual Smoothing Module, employed to smooth residual terms and facilitate stable convergence. Extensive experiments conducted on 11 real-world datasets across 14 backbone models demonstrate that ReLearner significantly enhances the predictive performance of existing STNNs.Our code is available on GitHub.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While effective on coarse-grained reasoning tasks, they suffer from significant performance degradation on tasks requiring fine-grained visual details. Through layer-wise analysis, we reveal substantial discrepancies in visual token importance across layers, showing that tokens deemed unimportant at shallow layers can later become highly relevant for text-conditioned reasoning. To avoid irreversible critical information loss caused by premature pruning, we introduce a new pruning paradigm, termed bypass, which preserves unselected visual tokens and forwards them to subsequent pruning stages for re-evaluation. Building on this paradigm, we propose SwiftVLM, a simple and training-free method that performs pruning at model-specific layers with strong visual token selection capability, while enabling independent pruning decisions across layers.

FSOD-VFM integrates three key components: a universal proposal network (UPN) for category-agnostic bounding box generation, SAM2 for accurate mask extraction, and DINOv2 features for efficient adaptation to new object categories. Despite the strong generalization capabilities of foundation models, the bounding boxes generated by UPN often suffer from overfragmentation, covering only partial object regions and leading to numerous small, false-positive proposals rather than accurate, complete object detections. To address this issue, we introduce a novel graph-based confidence reweighting method. In our approach, predicted bounding boxes are modeled as nodes in a directed graph, with graph diffusion operations applied to propagate confidence scores across the network. This reweighting process refines the scores of proposals, assigning higher confidence to whole objects and lower confidence to local, fragmented parts. This strategy improves detection granularity and effectively reduces the occurrence of false-positive bounding box proposals. Through extensive experiments on Pascal-5$^i$, COCO-20$^i$, and CD-FSOD datasets, we demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior performance without requiring additional training. Notably, on the challenging CD-FSOD dataset, which spans multiple datasets and domains, our FSOD-VFM achieves 31.6 AP in the 10-shot setting, substantially outperforming previous training-free methods that reach only 21.4 AP.

However, their effectiveness drops sharply when certain modalities are unavailable or incomplete. Current research primarily faces two dilemmas: Prompt-based methods struggle to restore missing yet indispensable features and impair generalization of VLMs. Imputation-based approaches, lacking effective guidance, are prone to generating semantically irrelevant noise. Restoring precise semantics while sustaining VLM generalization remains challenging. Therefore, we propose a general missing modality restoration strategy in this paper. We introduce an enhanced diffusion model as a pluggable mid-stage training module to effectively restore missing features. Our strategy introduces two key innovations: (I) Dynamic Modality Gating, which adaptively leverages conditional features to steer the generation of semantically consistent features; (II) Cross-Modal Mutual Learning mechanism, which bridges the semantic spaces of dual encoders to achieve bidirectional alignment.

However, DMD tends to suffer from mode collapse, as its reverse-KL formulation inherently encourages mode-seeking behavior, for which existing remedies typically rely on perceptual or adversarial regularization, thereby incurring substantial computational overhead and training instability. In this work, we propose a role-separated distillation framework that explicitly disentangles the roles of distilled steps: the first step is dedicated to preserving sample diversity via a target-prediction (e.g., v-prediction) objective, while subsequent steps focus on quality refinement under the standard DMD loss, with gradients from the DMD objective blocked at the first step. We term this approach Diversity-Preserved DMD (DP-DMD), which, despite its simplicity -- no perceptual backbone, no discriminator, no auxiliary networks, and no additional ground-truth images -- preserves sample diversity while maintaining visual quality on par with state-of-the-art methods in extensive text-to-image experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Value-based approaches offer a more principled path, yet three gaps persist: extraction often ignores hierarchical structure, evaluation detects presence but not calibrated intensity, and the steerability of LLMs at controlled intensities remains insufficiently understood. To address these limitations, we introduce VALUEFLOW, the first unified framework that spans extraction, evaluation, and steering with calibrated intensity control. The framework integrates three components: (i) HIVES, a hierarchical value embedding space that captures intra- and cross-theory value structure; (ii) the Value Intensity DataBase (VIDB), a large-scale resource of value-labeled texts with intensity estimates derived from ranking-based aggregation; and (iii) an anchor-based evaluator that produces consistent intensity scores for model outputs by ranking them against VIDB panels. Using VALUEFLOW, we conduct a comprehensive large-scale study across ten models and four value theories, identifying asymmetries in steerability and composition laws for multi-value control.

Studies found that unfairness may be due to feedback loops and being trained on historically biased recorded data. However, comparative studies on predictive policing systems are few and are not sufficiently comprehensive. In this work, we perform a comprehensive comparative simulation study on the fairness and accuracy of predictive policing technologies in Baltimore. Our results suggest that the situation around bias in predictive policing is more complex than was previously assumed. While predictive policing exhibited bias due to feedback loops as was previously reported, we found that the traditional alternative, hot spots policing, had similar issues. Predictive policing was found to be more fair and accurate than hot spots policing in the short term, although it amplified bias faster, suggesting the potential for worse long-run behavior. In Baltimore, in some cases the bias in these systems tended toward over-policing in White neighborhoods, unlike in previous studies.

Consequently, existing studies can only incorporate few KAN layers, hindering the comprehensive exploration of KANs. This study overcomes these limitations and introduces the first fully KA-based deep model, demonstrating that KA-based layers can entirely replace traditional architectures in deep learning and achieve superior learning capacity. Specifically, (1) the proposed Share-activation KAN (SaKAN) reformulates Sprecher's variant of Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, which achieves better optimization due to its simplified parameterization and denser training samples, to ease training difficulty, (2) this paper indicates that spline gradients contribute negligibly to training while consuming huge GPU memory, thus proposes the Grad-Free Spline to significantly reduce memory usage and computational overhead. (3) Building on these two innovations, our ALL U-KAN is the first representative implementation of fully KA-based deep model, where the proposed KA and KAonv layers completely replace FC and Conv layers. Extensive evaluations on three medical image segmentation tasks confirm the superiority of the full KA-based architecture compared to partial KA-based and traditional architectures, achieving all higher segmentation accuracy. Compared to directly deeply stacked KAN, ALL U-KAN achieves 10 times reduction in parameter count and reduces memory consumption by more than 20 times, unlocking the new explorations into deep KAN architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u57fa\u4e8eKolmogorov-Arnold\uff08KA\uff09\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7Share-activation KAN\u548cGrad-Free Spline\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u7a81\u7834\u6df1\u5ea6KAN\u5806\u53e0\u7684\u96be\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5806\u53e0KAN\u5b58\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u56f0\u96be\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u5927\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ea\u80fd\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u6570KAN\u5c42\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86KAN\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u5168\u57fa\u4e8eKA\u5c42\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "1) \u63d0\u51faShare-activation KAN\uff08SaKAN\uff09\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eSprecher\u53d8\u4f53\u7684Kolmogorov-Arnold\u8868\u793a\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u7b80\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5e76\u589e\u52a0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff1b2) \u53d1\u73b0\u6837\u6761\u68af\u5ea6\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u8d21\u732e\u5fae\u5c0f\u4f46\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u91cfGPU\u5185\u5b58\uff0c\u63d0\u51faGrad-Free Spline\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff1b3) \u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u521b\u65b0\u6784\u5efaALL U-KAN\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528KA\u548cKAonv\u5c42\u5b8c\u5168\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edfFC\u548cConv\u5c42\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168KA\u67b6\u6784\u76f8\u6bd4\u90e8\u5206KA\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\u90fd\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u6df1\u5ea6\u5806\u53e0KAN\uff0cALL U-KAN\u53c2\u6570\u6570\u91cf\u51cf\u5c1110\u500d\uff0c\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u964d\u4f4e20\u500d\u4ee5\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6210\u529f\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6KAN\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86KA\u5c42\u80fd\u591f\u5b8c\u5168\u66ff\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6KAN\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

This human-in-the-loop adaptation is employed in a group-activity video retrieval framework to improve its retrieval performance. Our method initially pre-trains the GAF space based on the similarity of group activities in a self-supervised manner, unlike prior work that classifies videos into pre-defined group activity classes in a supervised learning manner. Our interactive fine-tuning process updates the GAF space to allow a user to better retrieve videos similar to query videos given by the user. In this fine-tuning, our proposed data-efficient video selection process provides several videos, which are selected from a video database, to the user in order to manually label these videos as positive or negative. These labeled videos are used to update (i.e., fine-tune) the GAF space, so that the positive and negative videos move closer to and farther away from the query videos through contrastive learning. Our comprehensive experimental results on two team sports datasets validate that our method significantly improves the retrieval performance. Ablation studies also demonstrate that several components in our human-in-the-loop adaptation contribute to the improvement of the retrieval performance.

To address task-order effects, HTCL identifies the best intra-group task sequence and integrates the resulting local updates through a Hessian-regularized Taylor expansion, yielding a consolidation step with theoretical guarantees. The approach naturally extends to an $L$-level hierarchy, enabling multiscale knowledge integration in a manner not supported by conventional single-level CL systems. Across a wide range of datasets and replay and regularization baselines, HTCL acts as a model-agnostic consolidation layer that consistently enhances performance, yielding mean accuracy gains of $7\\%$ to $25\\%$ while reducing the standard deviation of final accuracy by up to $68\\%$ across random task permutations.", "AI": {"tldr": "HTCL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5feb\u901f\u5c40\u90e8\u9002\u5e94\u4e0e\u4fdd\u5b88\u7684\u4e8c\u9636\u5168\u5c40\u6574\u5408\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u987a\u5e8f\u65b9\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u968f\u673a\u4efb\u52a1\u987a\u5e8f\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u9ad8\u65b9\u5dee\u800c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0cHTCL\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u4efb\u52a1\u987a\u5e8f\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bfb\u627e\u6700\u4f73\u7ec4\u5185\u4efb\u52a1\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528Hessian\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u6cf0\u52d2\u5c55\u5f00\u6574\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u5f62\u6210\u5177\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u6574\u5408\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u591a\u7ea7\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u77e5\u8bc6\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\uff0cHTCL\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6574\u5408\u5c42\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u9ad87%-25%\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6807\u51c6\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u6700\u9ad8\u8fbe68%\u3002", "conclusion": "HTCL\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4efb\u52a1\u987a\u5e8f\u65b9\u5dee\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5176\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7279\u6027\u548c\u591a\u7ea7\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u7ea7\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing evaluations often rely on fragmented, researcher-specific frameworks where the prompt engineering for reasoning and tool usage varies significantly, making it difficult to attribute performance gains to the model itself.

This mechanism enables a Fold inference mode, where the model periodically summarizes its thought process and discards former thoughts to reduce dependency on historical tokens. We apply reinforcement learning to incentivize this capability further, uncovering a critical insight: the accuracy gap between the highly efficient Fold mode and the exhaustive Unfold mode progressively narrows and eventually vanishes over the course of training. This phenomenon demonstrates that the model learns to encode essential reasoning information into compact summaries, achieving effective compression of the reasoning context. Our Accordion-Thinker demonstrates that with learned self-compression, LLMs can tackle complex reasoning tasks with minimal dependency token overhead without compromising solution quality, and it achieves a 3x throughput while maintaining accuracy on a 48GB GPU memory configuration, while the structured step summaries provide a human-readable account of the reasoning process.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Inspired by the spirit of classical magnitude pruning, we study whether the magnitude of weight updates during reasoning-incentivized fine-tuning can provide valuable signals for quantizing Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). We hypothesize that the smallest and largest weight updates during fine-tuning are more important than those of intermediate magnitude, a phenomenon we term \"protecting both ends\". Upon hypothesis validation, we introduce QuantLRM, which stands for weight quantization of LRMs via fine-tuning signals. We fit simple restricted quadratic functions on weight updates to protect both ends. By multiplying the average quadratic values with the count of zero weight updates of channels, we compute channel importance that is more effective than using activation or second-order information. We run QuantLRM to quantize various fine-tuned models (including supervised, direct preference optimization, and reinforcement learning fine-tuning) over four reasoning benchmarks (AIME-120, FOLIO, temporal sequences, and GPQA-Diamond) and empirically find that QuantLRM delivers a consistent improvement for LRMs quantization, with an average improvement of 6.55% on a reinforcement learning fine-tuned model. Also supporting non-fine-tuned LRMs, QuantLRM gathers effective signals via pseudo-fine-tuning, which greatly enhances its applicability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this, we propose Agentic Proposing, a framework that models problem synthesis as a goal-driven sequential decision process where a specialized agent dynamically selects and composes modular reasoning skills. Through an iterative workflow of internal reflection and tool-use, we develop the Agentic-Proposer-4B using Multi-Granularity Policy Optimization (MGPO) to generate high-precision, verifiable training trajectories across mathematics, coding, and science. Empirical results demonstrate that downstream solvers trained on agent-synthesized data significantly outperform leading baselines and exhibit robust cross-domain generalization.

In practice, however, system operators often lack access to fleet-level probabilistic models and instead rely on site-level forecasts produced by heterogeneous third-party providers. Constructing coherent and calibrated fleet-level probabilistic forecasts from such inputs remains challenging due to complex cross-site dependencies and aggregation-induced miscalibration. This paper proposes a calibrated probabilistic aggregation framework that directly converts site-level probabilistic forecasts into reliable fleet-level forecasts in settings where system-level models cannot be trained or maintained. The framework integrates copula-based dependence modeling to capture cross-site correlations with Context-Aware Conformal Prediction (CACP) to correct miscalibration at the aggregated level. This combination enables dependence-aware aggregation while providing valid coverage and maintaining sharp prediction intervals.

Although world models provide a cost-effective solution for generating realistic driving data, they often suffer from identity drift, where the same object changes its appearance or category across frames due to the absence of instance-level temporal constraints. We introduce ConsisDrive, an identity-preserving driving world model designed to enforce temporal consistency at the instance level. Our framework incorporates two key components: (1) Instance-Masked Attention, which applies instance identity masks and trajectory masks within attention blocks to ensure that visual tokens interact only with their corresponding instance features across spatial and temporal dimensions, thereby preserving object identity consistency; and (2) Instance-Masked Loss, which adaptively emphasizes foreground regions with probabilistic instance masking, reducing background noise while maintaining overall scene fidelity. By integrating these mechanisms, ConsisDrive achieves state-of-the-art driving video generation quality and demonstrates significant improvements in downstream autonomous driving tasks on the nuScenes dataset.

Existing meeting benchmarks mainly focus on simplified question answering and fail to reflect real world enterprise workflows, where queries arise organically from multi stakeholder collaboration, span long temporal contexts, and require tool augmented reasoning.\n  We address this gap through a grounded dataset and a learned agent framework. First, we introduce MeetAll, a bilingual and multimodal corpus derived from 231 enterprise meetings totaling 140 hours. Questions are injected using an enterprise informed protocol validated by domain expert review and human discriminability studies. Unlike purely synthetic benchmarks, this protocol is grounded in four enterprise critical dimensions: cognitive load, temporal context span, domain expertise, and actionable task execution, calibrated through interviews with stakeholders across finance, healthcare, and technology sectors.\n  Second, we propose MeetBench XL, a multi dimensional evaluation protocol aligned with human judgment that measures factual fidelity, intent alignment, response efficiency, structural clarity, and completeness. Third, we present MeetMaster XL, a learned dual policy agent that jointly optimizes query routing between fast and slow reasoning paths and tool invocation, including retrieval, cross meeting aggregation, and web search. A lightweight classifier enables accurate routing with minimal overhead, achieving a superior quality latency tradeoff over single model baselines.

However, high-performance trackers often suffer from slow processing speeds, making them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Since autoregression emphasizes the temporal nature of the trajectory sequence, it can maintain high performance while achieving efficient execution across various devices. FARTrack introduces Task-Specific Self-Distillation and Inter-frame Autoregressive Sparsification, designed from the perspectives of shallow-yet-accurate distillation and redundant-to-essential token optimization, respectively. Task-Specific Self-Distillation achieves model compression by distilling task-specific tokens layer by layer, enhancing the model's inference speed while avoiding suboptimal manual teacher-student layer pairs assignments. Meanwhile, Inter-frame Autoregressive Sparsification sequentially condenses multiple templates, avoiding additional runtime overhead while learning a temporally-global optimal sparsification strategy. FARTrack demonstrates outstanding speed and competitive performance. It delivers an AO of 70.6% on GOT-10k in real-time.

Namely, it takes into account two ideas that have received little attention in the literature on computational argumentation: First, an agent may rationally reject an argument based on mere doubt, thus not all arguments they could defend must be accepted; and, second, that it is sometimes more natural to think in terms of which individual sentences or claims an agent accepts in a debate, rather than which arguments. In order to incorporate these two ideas into a computational approach, we first define the notion of structured bipolar argumentation frameworks (SBAFs), where arguments consist of sentences and we have both an attack and a support relation between them. Then, we provide semantics for SBAFs with two features: (1) Unlike with completeness-based semantics, our semantics do not force agents to accept all defended arguments. (2) In addition to argument extensions, which give acceptable sets of arguments, we also provide semantics for language extensions that specify acceptable sets of sentences. These semantics represent reasonable positions an agent might have in a debate. Our semantics lie between the admissible and complete semantics of abstract argumentation. Further, our approach can be used to provide a new perspective on existing approaches. For instance, we can specify the conditions under which an agent can ignore support between arguments (i.e. under which the use of abstract argumentation is warranted) and we show that deductive support semantics is a special case of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we propose a unified framework that abstracts general learning tasks as the progressive coverage of patterns from a long-tail (Zipfian) distribution. We introduce the Effective Frontier ($k_\\star$), a threshold in the pattern rank space that separates learned knowledge from the unlearned tail. We prove that reducible loss is asymptotically determined by the probability mass of the tail a resource-dependent frontier truncation. Based on our framework, we derive the precise scaling laws for $N$, $D$, and $C$, attributing them to capacity, coverage, and optimization bottlenecks, respectively.

By decoupling text and style conditioning at the attention level, our method enables effective reference-free stylized generation while keeping the pretrained diffusion backbone fully frozen.PokeFusion Attention trains only decoder cross-attention layers together with a compact style projection module, resulting in a parameter-efficient and plug-and-play control component that can be easily integrated into existing diffusion pipelines and transferred across different backbones.Experiments on a stylized character generation benchmark (Pokemon-style) demonstrate that our method consistently improves style fidelity, semantic alignment, and character shape consistency compared with representative adapter-based baselines, while maintaining low parameter overhead and inference-time simplicity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While effective in many settings, these measures entangle intrinsic changes in the data with variations induced by arbitrary parametrizations. We introduce a projective geometric view of representation drift grounded in the Fubini Study metric, which identifies representations that differ only by gauge transformations such as global rescalings or sign flips. Applying this framework to empirical high dimensional datasets, we explicitly construct representation trajectories and track their evolution through cumulative geometric drift. Comparing Euclidean, cosine and Fubini Study distances along these trajectories reveals that conventional metrics systematically overestimate change whenever representations carry genuine projective ambiguity. By contrast, the Fubini Study metric isolates intrinsic evolution by remaining invariant under gauge-induced fluctuations. We further show that the difference between cosine and Fubini Study drift defines a computable, monotone quantity that directly captures representation churn attributable to gauge freedom. This separation provides a diagnostic for distinguishing meaningful structural evolution from parametrization artifacts, without introducing model-specific assumptions. Overall, we establish a geometric criterion for assessing representation stability in high-dimensional systems and clarify the limits of angular distances.

When adapted to vision transformers, the standard axial formulation decomposes two-dimensional spatial positions into horizontal and vertical components, implicitly restricting positional encoding to axis-aligned directions. We identify this directional constraint as a fundamental limitation of the standard axial 2D RoPE, which hinders the modeling of oblique spatial relationships that naturally exist in natural images. To overcome this limitation, we propose Spiral RoPE, a simple yet effective extension that enables multi-directional positional encoding by partitioning embedding channels into multiple groups associated with uniformly distributed directions. Each group is rotated according to the projection of the patch position onto its corresponding direction, allowing spatial relationships to be encoded beyond the horizontal and vertical axes. Across a wide range of vision tasks including classification, segmentation, and generation, Spiral RoPE consistently improves performance. Qualitative analysis of attention maps further show that Spiral RoPE exhibits more concentrated activations on semantically relevant objects and better respects local object boundaries, highlighting the importance of multi-directional positional encoding in vision transformers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textbf{MentalDx Bench}, the first benchmark dedicated to disorder-level psychiatric diagnosis within real-world clinical settings. Comprising 712 de-identified electronic health records annotated by board-certified psychiatrists under ICD-11 guidelines, the benchmark covers 76 disorders across 16 diagnostic categories. Evaluation of 18 LLMs reveals a critical \\textit{paradigm misalignment}: strong performance at coarse diagnostic categorization contrasts with systematic failure at disorder-level diagnosis, underscoring a gap between pattern-based modeling and clinical hypothetico-deductive reasoning. In response, we propose \\textbf{MentalSeek-Dx}, a medical-specialized LLM trained to internalize this clinical reasoning process through supervised trajectory construction and curriculum-based reinforcement learning.

Despite plausible codes generated by LLMs, producing solutions that meet the stringent correctness and performance requirements of systems demands iterative optimization. Test-time reinforcement learning offers high search efficiency but requires parameter updates infeasible under API-only access, while existing training-free evolutionary methods suffer from inefficient context utilization and undirected search. We introduce ContextEvolve, a multi-agent framework that achieves RL-level search efficiency under strict parameter-blind constraints by decomposing optimization context into three orthogonal dimensions: a Summarizer Agent condenses semantic state via code-to-language abstraction, a Navigator Agent distills optimization direction from trajectory analysis, and a Sampler Agent curates experience distribution through prioritized exemplar retrieval. This orchestration forms a functional isomorphism with RL-mapping to state representation, policy gradient, and experience replay-enabling principled optimization in a textual latent space.

Technically, we build EventMind, a large-scale and scene-diverse dataset with over 500k instruction sets, providing both short and long event stream sequences to support our curriculum training strategy. We then present an adaptive temporal window aggregation module for efficient temporal sampling, which adaptively compresses temporal tokens while retaining key temporal cues. Finally, a sparse density-guided attention module is designed to improve spatial token efficiency by selecting informative regions and suppressing empty or sparse areas. Experimental results show that EventFlash achieves a $12.4\\times$ throughput improvement over the baseline (EventFlash-Zero) while maintaining comparable performance. It supports long-range event stream processing with up to 1,000 bins, significantly outperforming the 5-bin limit of EventGPT.

By incorporating these instance-aware mechanisms, InstaDrive achieves state-of-the-art video generation quality and enhances downstream autonomous driving tasks on the nuScenes dataset.

Our analysis reveals that the sampling strategy itself plays a central role in safety behavior, as a factor distinct from the underlying learned representations. Motivated by this analysis, we introduce the Step-Wise Refusal Internal Dynamics (SRI) signal, which supports interpretability and improved safety for both AR and DLMs. We demonstrate that the geometric structure of SRI captures internal recovery dynamics, and identifies anomalous behavior in harmful generations as cases of \\emph{incomplete internal recovery} that are not observable at the text level.

Using LaVPR, we investigate two paradigms: Multi-Modal Fusion for enhanced robustness and Cross-Modal Retrieval for language-based localization. Our results show that language descriptions yield consistent gains in visually degraded conditions, with the most significant impact on smaller backbones. Notably, adding language allows compact models to rival the performance of much larger vision-only architectures.

Motivated by this, we propose Risk Awareness Injection (RAI), a lightweight and training-free framework for safety calibration that restores LLM-like risk recognition by amplifying unsafe signals in VLMs. Specifically, RAI constructs an Unsafe Prototype Subspace from language embeddings and performs targeted modulation on selected high-risk visual tokens, explicitly activating safety-critical signals within the cross-modal feature space. This modulation restores the model's LLM-like ability to detect unsafe content from visual inputs, while preserving the semantic integrity of original tokens for cross-modal reasoning.

The resulting arc-lengths along these flows define interpretable intrinsic coordinates tied to a shared global frame. To prevent degenerate collapse, we enforce a non-shrinking constraint and derive a scalable, integration-free objective inspired by flow matching. Within our theoretical framework, we prove that minimizing the proposed objective recovers a global coordinate chart when one exists.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce the concept of an intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based conflict situation that captures agents' attitudes towards issue pairs with finer granularity than that afforded by classical preference-based models. Afterwards, we develop intuitionistic fuzzy preference-based conflict measures within this framework, and construct three-way conflict analysis models for trisecting the set of agent pairs, the agent set, and the issue set. Additionally, relative loss functions built on the proposed conflict functions are employed to calculate thresholds for three-way conflict analysis.

We propose a semi-supervised discovery pipeline that (i) learns an embedding function from the labeled subset, (ii) performs label-guided clustering over embeddings of both labeled and unlabeled samples to form candidate behavior groups, and (iii) decides whether a discovered group is truly novel using a containment score. Our key contribution is a KDE + HDR (highest-density region) containment score that measures how much a discovered cluster distribution is contained within, or contains, each known-class distribution; the best-match containment score serves as an interpretable novelty statistic. In experiments where an entire behavior is withheld from supervision and appears only in the unlabeled pool, the method recovers a distinct cluster and the containment score flags novelty via low overlap, while a negative-control setting with no novel behavior yields consistently higher overlaps.

We investigate this limitation by testing the ability of geometric metrics to predict compositional binding across 21 vision encoders. We find that standard geometry-based statistics exhibit near-zero correlation with compositional binding. In contrast, functional sensitivity, as measured by the input-output Jacobian, reliably tracks this capability. We further provide an analytic account showing that this disparity arises from objective design, as existing losses explicitly constrain embedding geometry but leave the local input-output mapping unconstrained.

However, users are often ambiguous because they have not yet formed their intents: they must observe and explore outcomes to discover what they want. Simply asking \"what kind of tone do you want?\" fails when users themselves do not know. We introduce DiscoverLLM, a novel and generalizable framework that trains LLMs to help users form and discover their intents. Central to our approach is a novel user simulator that models cognitive state with a hierarchy of intents that progressively concretize as the model surfaces relevant options -- where the degree of concretization serves as a reward signal that models can be trained to optimize.

The core bottleneck lies in the scarcity of training data that captures authentic long-dependency structures and cross-stage evolutionary dynamics--existing synthesis methods either confine to single-feature scenarios constrained by model distribution, or incur prohibitive human annotation costs, failing to provide scalable, high-quality supervision. We address this by reconceptualizing data synthesis through the lens of real-world software evolution. Our key insight: Pull Request (PR) sequences naturally embody the supervision signals for long-horizon learning. They decompose complex objectives into verifiable submission units, maintain functional coherence across iterations, and encode authentic refinement patterns through bug-fix histories. Building on this, we propose daVinci-Agency, which systematically mines structured supervision from chain-of-PRs through three interlocking mechanisms: (1) progressive task decomposition via continuous commits, (2) long-term consistency enforcement through unified functional objectives, and (3) verifiable refinement from authentic bug-fix trajectories. Unlike synthetic trajectories that treat each step independently, daVinci-Agency's PR-grounded structure inherently preserves the causal dependencies and iterative refinements essential for teaching persistent goal-directed behavior and enables natural alignment with project-level, full-cycle task modeling. The resulting trajectories are substantial--averaging 85k tokens and 116 tool calls--yet remarkably data-efficient: fine-tuning GLM-4.6 on 239 daVinci-Agency samples yields broad improvements across benchmarks, notably achieving a 47% relative gain on Toolathlon.

Among existing TTA strategies, pseudo-label-based methods have shown promising performance. However, they often rely on perturbation-ensemble heuristics (e.g., dropout sampling, test-time augmentation, Gaussian noise), which lack distributional grounding and yield unstable training signals. This can trigger error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting during adaptation. To address this, we propose \\textbf{A3-TTA}, a TTA framework that constructs reliable pseudo-labels through anchor-guided supervision. Specifically, we identify well-predicted target domain images using a class compact density metric, under the assumption that confident predictions imply distributional proximity to the source domain. These anchors serve as stable references to guide pseudo-label generation, which is further regularized via semantic consistency and boundary-aware entropy minimization. Additionally, we introduce a self-adaptive exponential moving average strategy to mitigate label noise and stabilize model update during adaptation. Evaluated on both multi-domain medical images (heart structure and prostate segmentation) and natural images, A3-TTA significantly improves average Dice scores by 10.40 to 17.68 percentage points compared to the source model, outperforming several state-of-the-art TTA methods under different segmentation model architectures.

We introduce CRL-VLA, a framework for continual post-training of VLA models with rigorous theoretical bounds. We derive a unified performance bound linking the stability-plasticity trade-off to goal-conditioned advantage magnitude, scaled by policy divergence. CRL-VLA resolves this dilemma via asymmetric regulation: constraining advantage magnitudes on prior tasks while enabling controlled growth on new tasks. This is realized through a simple but effective dual-critic architecture with novel Goal-Conditioned Value Formulation (GCVF), where a frozen critic anchors semantic consistency and a trainable estimator drives adaptation.

Recent work has shown that state-of-the-art trade-offs between certified robustness and standard performance can be obtained through a family of losses combining adversarial outputs and neural network bounds. Nevertheless, differently from empirical robustness, verifiability still comes at a significant cost in standard performance. In this work, we propose to leverage empirically-robust teachers to improve the performance of certifiably-robust models through knowledge distillation.

FOCUS sequentially performs image quality assessment with EfficientNetV2-S, followed by abnormality detection and multi-disease classification using a fine-tuned Vision Foundation Model. Crucially, FOCUS leverages a unified adaptive aggregation method to intelligently integrate 2D slices-level predictions into comprehensive 3D patient-level diagnosis. Trained and tested on 3,300 patients (40,672 slices), and externally validated on 1,345 patients (18,498 slices) across four different-tier centers and diverse OCT devices, FOCUS achieved high F1 scores for quality assessment (99.01%), abnormally detection (97.46%), and patient-level diagnosis (94.39%).

Utilizing Answer Set Programming (ASP) as a formal framework, we define a notion of irrelevant details to be abstracted over to obtain simplified explanations. Our cognitive experiments, in which participants classified stimuli across domains with explanations derived from an answer set program, show that clustering details significantly improve participants' understanding, while removal of details significantly reduce cognitive effort, supporting the hypothesis that abstraction enhances human-centered symbolic explanations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

When limited datasets are available, smaller-sized LLMs are better choice to pretrain (on user-specified datasets) by following the scaling laws of LLMs. Using pretrained models, vector embeddings can be generated for raw data and stored using vector databases to support modern AI applications and semantic search. In this work, we investigate the performance of pretraining techniques for smaller-sized LLMs on an experimental testbed (with commodity GPUs) available to academic users at no charge. We consider data parallelism, intra-operator parallelism, and inter-operator/pipeline parallelism, and their combinations for pretraining. We set up different GPU clusters with homogeneous and heterogeneous GPU hardware. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of network latency on pretraining performance especially when GPUs are geographically distributed. We used GPT-2 medium and large models and pretrained them using open-source packages, namely, Alpa and Ray. We observed that Alpa's execution plans that collectively optimized intra-operator and inter-operator/pipeline parallelism consistently performed the best when GPUs were geographically distributed. This was especially true when the network latencies were in 10's of milliseconds. Based on the insights gained from the experiments, we propose a systematic approach for selecting the appropriate pretraining technique to achieve high training performance/lower execution time as well as to reduce the number of GPUs used.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our approach introduces a continuous-time model under which regret decomposes into a delay-independent learning term and a delay-induced drift term, yielding a delay-adaptive reduction that converts any algorithm for online linear optimization into one that handles round-dependent delays. For bandit convex optimization, we significantly improve existing regret bounds, with delay-dependent terms matching state-of-the-art first-order rates. For first-order feedback, we recover state-of-the-art regret bounds via a simpler, unified analysis. Quantitatively, for bandit convex optimization we obtain $O(\\sqrt{d_{\\text{tot}}} + T^{\\frac{3}{4}}\\sqrt{k})$ regret, improving the delay-dependent term from $O(\\min\\{\\sqrt{T d_{\\text{max}}},(Td_{\\text{tot}})^{\\frac{1}{3}}\\})$ in previous work to $O(\\sqrt{d_{\\text{tot}}})$.

At the same time, in practical applications, generative data augmentation can be vulnerable to clean-label backdoor attacks, which aim to bypass human inspection. However, based on theoretical analysis and preliminary experiments, we observe that directly applying existing pixel-level clean-label backdoor attack methods (e.g., COMBAT) to generated images results in low attack success rates. This motivates us to move beyond pixel-level triggers and focus instead on the latent feature level. To this end, we propose InvLBA, an invisible clean-label backdoor attack method for generative data augmentation by latent perturbation. We theoretically prove that the generalization of the clean accuracy and attack success rates of InvLBA can be guaranteed.

However, across both unimodal and multimodal settings, we uncover a pervasive yet underexplored failure mode in existing routers: as the user's cost budget increases, routers systematically default to the most capable and most expensive model even when cheaper models already suffice. As a result, current routers under-utilize small models, wasting computation and monetary cost and undermining the core promise of routing; we term this phenomenon routing collapse. We attribute routing collapse to an objective--decision mismatch: many routers are trained to predict scalar performance scores, whereas routing decisions ultimately depend on discrete comparisons among candidate models. Consequently, small prediction errors can flip relative orderings and trigger suboptimal selections. To bridge this gap, we propose EquiRouter, a decision-aware router that directly learns model rankings, restoring the role of smaller models and mitigating routing collapse. On RouterBench, EquiRouter reduces cost by about 17\\% at GPT-4-level performance compared to the strongest prior router.

In this study, we analyze data from the Xenium platform, which captures high-resolution images of tumor microarray (TMA) tissues and converts them into cell-by-gene matrices suitable for computational analysis. We benchmark and extend nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) for spatial transcriptomics by introducing two spatially regularized variants. First, we propose Spatial NMF (SNMF), a lightweight baseline that enforces local spatial smoothness by diffusing each cell's NMF factor vector over its spatial neighborhood. Second, we introduce Hybrid Spatial NMF (hSNMF), which performs spatially regularized NMF followed by Leiden clustering on a hybrid adjacency that integrates spatial proximity (via a contact-radius graph) and transcriptomic similarity through a tunable mixing parameter alpha. Evaluated on a cholangiocarcinoma dataset, SNMF and hSNMF achieve markedly improved spatial compactness (CHAOS < 0.004, Moran's I > 0.96), greater cluster separability (Silhouette > 0.12, DBI < 1.8), and higher biological coherence (CMC and enrichment) compared to other spatial baselines.

Recent research leverages Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) as autonomous agents, employing reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) to orchestrate specialized tools like the Segment Anything Model (SAM). However, these approaches often rely on single-turn, rigid interaction strategies and lack process-level supervision during training, which hinders their ability to fully exploit the dynamic potential of interactive tools and leads to redundant actions. To bridge this gap, we propose MedSAM-Agent, a framework that reformulates interactive segmentation as a multi-step autonomous decision-making process. First, we introduce a hybrid prompting strategy for expert-curated trajectory generation, enabling the model to internalize human-like decision heuristics and adaptive refinement strategies. Furthermore, we develop a two-stage training pipeline that integrates multi-turn, end-to-end outcome verification with a clinical-fidelity process reward design to promote interaction parsimony and decision efficiency. Extensive experiments across 6 medical modalities and 21 datasets demonstrate that MedSAM-Agent achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively unifying autonomous medical reasoning with robust, iterative optimization.

In this paper, we examine the long-term consequences of AI use for human cultural evolution and the conditions under which widespread AI use may lead to \"cultural collapse\", a process in which reliance on AI-generated content reduces human variation and innovation and slows cumulative cultural evolution. Using an agent-based model and evolutionary game theory, we compare two types of AI use: complement and substitute. AI-complement users seek suggestions and guidance while remaining the main producers of the final output, whereas AI-substitute users provide minimal input, and rely on AI to produce most of the output. We then study how these use strategies compete and spread under evolutionary dynamics. We find that AI-substitute users prevail under individual-level selection despite the stronger reduction in cultural variance. By contrast, AI-complement users can benefit their groups by maintaining the variance needed for exploration, and can therefore be favored under cultural group selection when group boundaries are strong.

MARA operates directly on the angular and radial coordinates of neighboring atoms, enabling flexible, geometrically informed, and modular weighting of local environments. Unlike existing attention mechanisms in SE(3)-equivariant architectures, MARA can be integrated in a plug-and-play manner into models such as MACE without architectural modifications.

Current defensive approaches remain cumbersome, often requiring invasive model modifications, expensive training procedures or auxiliary data access. To address these threats, in this paper, we propose a plug-and-play and non-invasive defense mechanism in the spectral domain, grounded in a theoretical and empirical analysis of the relationship between imperceptible perturbations and high-frequency spectral components. Building upon these insights, we introduce a novel purification framework, termed PWAVEP, which begins by computing a spectral graph wavelet domain saliency score and local sparsity score for each point. Guided by these values, PWAVEP adopts a hierarchical strategy, it eliminates the most salient points, which are identified as hardly recoverable adversarial outliers. Simultaneously, it applies a spectral filtering process to a broader set of moderately salient points.

CompTok uses a token-conditioned diffusion decoder. By employing an InfoGAN-style objective, where we train a recognition model to predict the tokens used to condition the diffusion decoder using the decoded images, we enforce the decoder to not ignore any of the tokens. To promote compositional control, besides the original images, CompTok also trains on tokens formed by swapping token subsets between images, enabling more compositional control of the token over the decoder. As the swapped tokens between images do not have ground truth image targets, we apply a manifold constraint via an adversarial flow regularizer to keep unpaired swap generations on the natural-image distribution. The resulting tokenizer not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on image class-conditioned generation, but also demonstrates properties such as swapping tokens between images to achieve high level semantic editing of an image. Additionally, we propose two metrics that measures the landscape of the token space that can be useful to describe not only the compositionality of the tokens, but also how easy to learn the landscape is for a generator to be trained on this space. We show in experiments that CompTok can improve on both of the metrics as well as supporting state-of-the-art generators for class conditioned generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

What governs the quality of generations in such systems? We present the first ever systematic investigation of this question. A priori, the expectation is that minimizing denoising trajectory sensitivity -- minimizing how perturbations amplify during sampling -- should govern generation quality. We demonstrate this hypothesis is incorrect: a stability-quality dissociation. Full ensemble routing, which combines all expert predictions at each step, achieves the most stable sampling dynamics and best numerical convergence while producing the worst generation quality (FID 47.9 vs. 22.6 for sparse Top-2 routing). Instead, we identify expert-data alignment as the governing principle: generation quality depends on routing inputs to experts whose training distribution covers the current denoising state. Across two distinct DDM systems, we validate expert-data alignment using (i) data-cluster distance analysis, confirming sparse routing selects experts with data clusters closest to the current denoising state, and (ii) per-expert analysis, showing selected experts produce more accurate predictions than non-selected ones, and (iii) expert disagreement analysis, showing quality degrades when experts disagree. For DDM deployment, our findings establish that routing should prioritize expert-data alignment over numerical stability metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This study investigates the limits of current AI agents by evaluating them against the 12th Global Trajectory Optimization Competition (GTOC 12), a complex astrodynamics challenge requiring the design of a large-scale asteroid mining campaign. We adapt the MLE-Bench framework to the domain of orbital mechanics and deploy an AIDE-based agent architecture to autonomously generate and refine mission solutions. To assess performance beyond binary validity, we employ an \"LLM-as-a-Judge\" methodology, utilizing a rubric developed by domain experts to evaluate strategic viability across five structural categories. A comparative analysis of models, ranging from GPT-4-Turbo to reasoning-enhanced architectures like Gemini 2.5 Pro, and o3, reveals a significant trend: the average strategic viability score has nearly doubled in the last two years (rising from 9.3 to 17.2 out of 26).

However, training these agents via reinforcement learning is hindered by the multi-scale credit assignment problem: existing methods typically rely on sparse, trajectory-level rewards that fail to distinguish between high-quality reasoning and fortuitous guesses, leading to redundant or misleading search behaviors. To address this, we propose Search-R2, a novel Actor-Refiner collaboration framework that enhances reasoning through targeted intervention, with both components jointly optimized during training. Our approach decomposes the generation process into an Actor, which produces initial reasoning trajectories, and a Meta-Refiner, which selectively diagnoses and repairs flawed steps via a 'cut-and-regenerate' mechanism. To provide fine-grained supervision, we introduce a hybrid reward design that couples outcome correctness with a dense process reward quantifying the information density of retrieved evidence. Theoretically, we formalize the Actor-Refiner interaction as a smoothed mixture policy, proving that selective correction yields strict performance gains over strong baselines. Extensive experiments across various general and multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that Search-R2 consistently outperforms strong RAG and RL-based baselines across model scales, achieving superior reasoning accuracy with minimal overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Practically, it suggests that tasks requiring equality-like comparisons (exact match, membership, etc.) are especially sensitive to quantization. Dropping even one bit can cross a threshold where the model cannot represent the needed comparison reliably. Thus, it paves the way for developing heuristics that will help practitioners choose how much quantization is possible: the precision should be chosen as a function of the length of equality to be checked for the specific task.\n  Our proofs combine explicit finite-precision Transformer constructions with communication-complexity lower bounds, yielding a tight \"one-bit\" threshold.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Through attention analysis, we identify conversational inertia, a phenomenon where models exhibit strong diagonal attention to previous responses, which is associated with imitation bias that constrains exploration. This reveals a tension when transforming few-shot LLMs into agents: longer context enriches environmental feedback for exploitation, yet also amplifies conversational inertia that undermines exploration. Our key insight is that for identical states, actions generated with longer contexts exhibit stronger inertia than those with shorter contexts, enabling construction of preference pairs without environment rewards. Based on this, we propose Context Preference Learning to calibrate model preferences to favor low-inertia responses over highinertia ones. We further provide context management strategies at inference time to balance exploration and exploitation.

However, SFT often performs poorly in real-world settings with label noise, class imbalance, or sparse supervision. We introduce BinaryPPO, an offline reinforcement learning large language model (LLM) framework that reformulates binary classification as a reward maximization problem. Our method leverages a variant of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with a confidence-weighted reward function that penalizes uncertain or incorrect predictions, enabling the model to learn robust decision policies from static datasets without online interaction. Across eight domain-specific benchmarks and multiple models with differing architectures, BinaryPPO improves accuracy by 40-60 percentage points, reaching up to 99%, substantially outperforming supervised baselines.

Although significant progress has been made in existing methods, their optimization rely solely on the supervision from voxel labels and face the challenge of voxel sparsity as a large portion of voxels in autonomous driving scenarios are empty, which limits both optimization efficiency and model performance. To address this issue, we propose a \\textit{Multi-Resolution Alignment (MRA)} approach to mitigate voxel sparsity in camera-based 3D semantic scene completion, which exploits the scene and instance level alignment across multi-resolution 3D features as auxiliary supervision. Specifically, we first propose the Multi-resolution View Transformer module, which projects 2D image features into multi-resolution 3D features and aligns them at the scene level through fusing discriminative seed features. Furthermore, we design the Cubic Semantic Anisotropy module to identify the instance-level semantic significance of each voxel, accounting for the semantic differences of a specific voxel against its neighboring voxels within a cubic area. Finally, we devise a Critical Distribution Alignment module, which selects critical voxels as instance-level anchors with the guidance of cubic semantic anisotropy, and applies a circulated loss for auxiliary supervision on the critical feature distribution consistency across different resolutions.

However, we observe that reinforcement learning does not maximize this likelihood, and instead optimizes only a lower-order approximation. Inspired by this observation, we introduce Maximum Likelihood Reinforcement Learning (MaxRL), a sampling-based framework to approximate maximum likelihood using reinforcement learning techniques. MaxRL addresses the challenges of non-differentiable sampling by defining a compute-indexed family of sample-based objectives that interpolate between standard reinforcement learning and exact maximum likelihood as additional sampling compute is allocated. The resulting objectives admit a simple, unbiased policy-gradient estimator and converge to maximum likelihood optimization in the infinite-compute limit. Empirically, we show that MaxRL Pareto-dominates existing methods in all models and tasks we tested, achieving up to 20x test-time scaling efficiency gains compared to its GRPO-trained counterpart. We also observe MaxRL to scale better with additional data and compute.

Realizing this promise for increasingly complex, long-horizon tasks has driven the rise of a sub-agent-as-tools paradigm for multi-turn task solving. However, existing designs still lack a dynamic abstraction view of sub-agents, thereby hurting adaptability. We address this challenge with a unified, framework-agnostic agent abstraction that models any agent as a tuple Instruction, Context, Tools, Model. This tuple acts as a compositional recipe for capabilities, enabling the system to spawn specialized executors for each task on demand. Building on this abstraction, we introduce an agentic system AOrchestra, where the central orchestrator concretizes the tuple at each step: it curates task-relevant context, selects tools and models, and delegates execution via on-the-fly automatic agent creation. Such designs enable reducing human engineering efforts, and remain framework-agnostic with plug-and-play support for diverse agents as task executors. It also enables a controllable performance-cost trade-off, allowing the system to approach Pareto-efficient.

In this work, we propose the first theoretical analysis of steering strength. We characterize its effect on next token probability, presence of a concept, and cross-entropy, deriving precise qualitative laws governing these quantities. Our analysis reveals surprising behaviors, including non-monotonic effects of steering strength. We validate our theoretical predictions empirically on eleven language models, ranging from a small GPT architecture to modern models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We propose DiM, a new multi-dimensional watermarking framework that formulates watermarking as a dimension-aware mapping problem, thereby unifying existing watermarking methods at the functional level. Under DiM, watermark information is modeled as payloads of different dimensionalities, including one-dimensional binary messages, two-dimensional spatial masks, and three-dimensional spatiotemporal structures. We find that the dimensional configuration of embedding and extraction largely determines the resulting watermarking behavior. Same-dimensional mappings preserve payload structure and support fine-grained control, while cross-dimensional mappings enable spatial or spatiotemporal localization. We instantiate DiM in the video domain, where spatiotemporal representations enable a broader set of dimension mappings. Experiments demonstrate that varying only the embedding and extraction dimensions, without architectural changes, leads to different watermarking capabilities, including spatiotemporal tamper localization, local embedding control, and recovery of temporal order under frame disruptions.", "AI": {"tldr": "DiM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u7ef4\u6c34\u5370\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6c34\u5370\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u6620\u5c04\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u53d8\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u914d\u7f6e\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u65f6\u7a7a\u7be1\u6539\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u5d4c\u5165\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u5e27\u987a\u5e8f\u6062\u590d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u529f\u80fd\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u5dee\u5f02\u5f88\u5927\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u7d22\u7ef4\u5ea6\u914d\u7f6e\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cd\u6c34\u5370\u529f\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DiM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u6c34\u5370\u4fe1\u606f\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8f7d\u8377\uff081D\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6d88\u606f\u30012D\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a9\u7801\u30013D\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ed3\u6784\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ef4\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u6620\u5c04\u7edf\u4e00\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u57df\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316DiM\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u65f6\u7a7a\u8868\u793a\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6620\u5c04\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4ec5\u6539\u53d8\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u67b6\u6784\uff09\u5c31\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u80fd\u529b\uff1a\u65f6\u7a7a\u7be1\u6539\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u5d4c\u5165\u63a7\u5236\u4ee5\u53ca\u5e27\u987a\u5e8f\u6062\u590d\u7b49\u3002", "conclusion": "DiM\u6846\u67b6\u4ece\u529f\u80fd\u5c42\u9762\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u7ef4\u5ea6\u914d\u7f6e\u51b3\u5b9a\u6c34\u5370\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u529f\u80fd\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

This raises a fundamental question: what limits scaling, and why does diversity help? We present an information-theoretic framework showing that MAS performance is bounded by the intrinsic task uncertainty, not by agent count. We derive architecture-agnostic bounds demonstrating that improvements depend on how many effective channels the system accesses. Homogeneous agents saturate early because their outputs are strongly correlated, whereas heterogeneous agents contribute complementary evidence. We further introduce $K^*$, an effective channel count that quantifies the number of effective channels without ground-truth labels. Empirically, we show that heterogeneous configurations consistently outperform homogeneous scaling: 2 diverse agents can match or exceed the performance of 16 homogeneous agents. Our results provide principled guidelines for building efficient and robust MAS through diversity-aware design.

However, setting the token budget, as well as the threshold for adaptive reasoning, is a practical challenge that entails a fundamental risk-accuracy trade-off. We re-frame the budget setting problem as risk control, limiting the error rate while minimizing compute. Our framework introduces an upper threshold that stops reasoning when the model is confident (risking incorrect output) and a novel parametric lower threshold that preemptively stops unsolvable instances (risking premature stoppage).

Achieving long-horizon goals in complex environments remains a core challenge in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Domains with multiple entities are particularly difficult due to their combinatorial complexity. GCRL facilitates generalization across goals and the use of subgoal structure, but struggles with high-dimensional observations and combinatorial state-spaces, especially under sparse reward. We employ a two-level hierarchy composed of a value-based GCRL agent and a factored subgoal-generating conditional diffusion model. The RL agent and subgoal generator are trained independently and composed post hoc through selective subgoal generation based on the value function, making the approach modular and compatible with existing GCRL algorithms. We introduce new variations to benchmark tasks that highlight the challenges of multi-entity domains, and show that our method consistently boosts performance of the underlying RL agent on image-based long-horizon tasks with sparse rewards, achieving over 150% higher success rates on the hardest task in our suite and generalizing to increasing horizons and numbers of entities.

However, their reliance on reconstruction-based training creates a fundamental conflict between the sharp, high-frequency attention maps of the encoder and the spatially consistent but blurry reconstruction maps of the decoder. We identify that this discrepancy gives rise to a vicious cycle: the noisy feature map from the encoder forces the decoder to average over possibilities and produce even blurrier outputs, while the gradient computed from blurry reconstruction maps lacks high-frequency details necessary to supervise encoder features. To break this cycle, we introduce Synergistic Representation Learning (SRL) that establishes a virtuous cycle where the encoder and decoder mutually refine one another. SRL leverages the encoder's sharpness to deblur the semantic boundary within the decoder output, while exploiting the decoder's spatial consistency to denoise the encoder's features. This mutual refinement process is stabilized by a warm-up phase with a slot regularization objective that initially allocates distinct entities per slot. By bridging the representational gap between the encoder and decoder, SRL achieves state-of-the-art results on video object-centric learning benchmarks.

However, they often introduce visual hallucinations like over-optimized details and semantic misalignment. This work preliminarily explores why visual hallucinations arise and how to reduce them. We first investigate RFT methods from a unified perspective, and reveal the core problems stemming from two aspects, exploration and exploitation: (1) limited exploration during stochastic differential equation (SDE) rollouts, leading to an over-emphasis on local details at the expense of global semantics, and (2) trajectory imitation process inherent in policy gradient methods, distorting the model's foundational vector field and its cross-step consistency. Building on this, we propose ConsistentRFT, a general framework to mitigate these hallucinations. Specifically, we design a Dynamic Granularity Rollout (DGR) mechanism to balance exploration between global semantics and local details by dynamically scheduling different noise sources. We then introduce a Consistent Policy Gradient Optimization (CPGO) that preserves the model's consistency by aligning the current policy with a more stable prior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConsistentRFT significantly mitigates visual hallucinations, achieving average reductions of 49\\% for low-level and 38\\% for high-level perceptual hallucinations. Furthermore, ConsistentRFT outperforms other RFT methods on out-of-domain metrics, showing an improvement of 5.1\\% (v.s. the baseline's decrease of -0.4\\%) over FLUX1.dev.

Gary Wang"], "title": "TabPFN for Zero-shot Parametric Engineering Design Generation", "comment": "14 pages, 8 figures", "summary": "Deep generative models for engineering design often require substantial computational cost, large training datasets, and extensive retraining when design requirements or datasets change, limiting their applicability in real-world engineering design workflow. In this work, we propose a zero-shot generation framework for parametric engineering design based on TabPFN, enabling conditional design generation using only a limited number of reference samples and without any task-specific model training or fine-tuning. The proposed method generates design parameters sequentially conditioned on target performance indicators, providing a flexible alternative to conventional generative models. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated on three engineering design datasets, i.e., ship hull design, BlendedNet aircraft, and UIUC airfoil. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves competitive diversity across highly structured parametric design spaces, remains robust to variations in sampling, resolution and parameter dimensionality of geometry generation, and achieves a low performance error (e.g., less than 2% in generated ship hull designs' performance). Compared with diffusion-based generative models, the proposed framework significantly reduces computational overhead and data requirements while preserving reliable generation performance. These results highlight the potential of zero-shot, data-efficient generation as a practical and efficient tool for engineering design, enabling rapid deployment, flexible adaptation to new design settings, and ease of integration into real-world engineering workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eTabPFN\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u53c2\u8003\u6837\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5de5\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3001\u9700\u6c42\u53d8\u66f4\u65f6\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u5de5\u7a0b\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528", "method": "\u91c7\u7528TabPFN\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u987a\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6216\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u6709\u9650\u53c2\u8003\u6837\u672c", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5de5\u7a0b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6548\u679c\uff1a\u8239\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001BlendedNet\u98de\u673a\u3001UIUC\u7ffc\u578b\uff1b\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5f3a\uff0c\u5bf9\u91c7\u6837\u3001\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u7ef4\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u8bef\u5dee\u4f4e\uff08\u5982\u8239\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u8bef\u5dee\u4f4e\u4e8e2%\uff09\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42", "conclusion": "\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u5de5\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u9ad8\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5feb\u901f\u90e8\u7f72\u3001\u7075\u6d3b\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u6613\u4e8e\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u7a0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41"}}

To address this issue, we propose CoViP, a unified framework that treats personalized image captioning as a core task for contextualized visual personalization and improves this capability through reinforcement-learning-based post-training and caption-augmented generation. We further introduce diagnostic evaluations that explicitly rule out textual shortcut solutions and verify whether VLMs truly leverage visual context.

However, task-irrelevant morphologies such as background clutter and sensor noise induce redundant activations (or anomalies). These anomalies expand activation ranges and skew activation distributions toward task-irrelevant responses, complicating bit allocation and weakening the preservation of informative features. Without a clear criterion to distinguish anomalies, suppressing them can inadvertently discard useful information. To address this, we present InlierQ, an inlier-centric post-training quantization approach that separates anomalies from informative inliers. InlierQ computes gradient-aware volume saliency scores, classifies each volume as an inlier or anomaly, and fits a posterior distribution over these scores using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. This design suppresses anomalies while preserving informative features. InlierQ is label-free, drop-in, and requires only 64 calibration samples.

We introduce EDT-Former, an Entropy-guided Dynamic Token Transformer that generates tokens aligned with informative molecular patches, thereby preserving both local and global structural features for molecular graph understanding. Beyond prior approaches, EDT-Former enables alignment between frozen graph encoders and LLMs without tuning the LLM backbone (excluding the embedding layer), resulting in computationally efficient finetuning, and achieves stateof-the-art results on MoleculeQA, Molecule-oriented Mol-Instructions, and property prediction benchmarks (TDC, MoleculeNet), underscoring its effectiveness for scalable and generalizable multimodal molecular understanding", "AI": {"tldr": "EDT-Former\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u71b5\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4ee4\u724c\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u7247\u6bb5\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5206\u5b50\u56fe\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u7406\u89e3\u5206\u5b50\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u56fe-LLM\u8fde\u63a5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u56fa\u5b9a\u957f\u5ea6\u9759\u6001\u4ee4\u724c\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u7acb\u4f53\u5316\u5b66\u548c\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u8bed\u5883\uff0c\u4e14\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u7684LLM\u4e3b\u5e72\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faEDT-Former\uff08\u71b5\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4ee4\u724c\u8f6c\u6362\u5668\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u7247\u6bb5\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fdd\u7559\u5c40\u90e8\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u51bb\u7ed3\u56fe\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0eLLMs\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03LLM\u4e3b\u5e72\uff08\u5d4c\u5165\u5c42\u9664\u5916\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728MoleculeQA\u3001\u5206\u5b50\u5bfc\u5411\u7684Mol-Instructions\u4ee5\u53ca\u6027\u8d28\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\uff08TDC\u3001MoleculeNet\uff09\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u53ef\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5206\u5b50\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "EDT-Former\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u4ee4\u724c\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u5b50\u56fe\u7406\u89e3\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Some SSIL methods learn an inverse dynamics model (IDM) to predict the action from the current state and the next state. An IDM can act as a policy when paired with a video model (VM-IDM) or as a label generator to perform behavior cloning on action-free data (IDM labeling). In this work, we first show that VM-IDM and IDM labeling learn the same policy in a limit case, which we call the IDM-based policy. We then argue that the previously observed advantage of IDM-based policies over behavior cloning is due to the superior sample efficiency of IDM learning, which we attribute to two causes: (i) the ground-truth IDM tends to be contained in a lower complexity hypothesis class relative to the expert policy, and (ii) the ground-truth IDM is often less stochastic than the expert policy. We argue these claims based on insights from statistical learning theory and novel experiments, including a study of IDM-based policies using recent architectures for unified video-action prediction (UVA).

To better match the dynamic process of DiT generation and thereby enhance the diffusion model's generative capability, we introduce a unified normalized convex fusion framework equipped with lightweight gates to systematically organize multi-layer LLM hidden states via time-wise, depth-wise, and joint fusion. Experiments establish Depth-wise Semantic Routing as the superior conditioning strategy, consistently improving text-image alignment and compositional generation (e.g., +9.97 on the GenAI-Bench Counting task). Conversely, we find that purely time-wise fusion can paradoxically degrade visual generation fidelity. We attribute this to a train-inference trajectory mismatch: under classifier-free guidance, nominal timesteps fail to track the effective SNR, causing semantically mistimed feature injection during inference. Overall, our results position depth-wise routing as a strong and effective baseline and highlight the critical need for trajectory-aware signals to enable robust time-dependent conditioning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To tackle LAC, we propose LogiCls, a vision-language framework that decomposes complex logical constraints into a sequence of verifiable subqueries. We further present a data-centric instruction synthesis pipeline that generates chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision for these subqueries, coupling precise grounding annotations with diverse image-text augmentations to adapt vision language models (VLMs) to logic-sensitive reasoning.

Flattening fails to preserve temporal coherence even when it maintains valid marginal distributions. We introduce PATH, a novel generative framework that treats the full table as the unit of synthesis and leverages the autoregressive capabilities of privately fine-tuned large language models. Extensive evaluations show that PATH effectively captures long-range dependencies that traditional methods miss.

While such paradigms have shown remarkable success in 2D, extending them to 3D remains largely underexplored. Existing attempts to unify 3D tasks under a single autoregressive (AR) paradigm lead to significant performance degradation due to forced signal quantization and prohibitive training cost. Our key insight is that the essential challenge lies not in enforcing a unified autoregressive paradigm, but in enabling effective information interaction between generation and understanding while minimally compromising their inherent capabilities and leveraging pretrained models to reduce training cost. Guided by this perspective, we present the first unified framework for 3D understanding and generation that combines autoregression with diffusion. Specifically, we adopt an autoregressive next-token prediction paradigm for 3D understanding, and a continuous diffusion paradigm for 3D generation. A lightweight transformer bridges the feature space of large language models and the conditional space of 3D diffusion models, enabling effective cross-modal information exchange while preserving the priors learned by standalone models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse 3D understanding and generation benchmarks, while also excelling in 3D editing tasks.

A core challenge in this setting is catastrophic forgetting, where new learning interferes with past knowledge. Among various mitigation strategies, data-replay methods, where past samples are periodically revisited, are considered simple yet effective, especially when memory constraints are relaxed. However, the theoretical effectiveness of full data replay, where all past data is accessible during training, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive theoretical framework for analyzing full data-replay training in continual learning from a feature learning perspective. Adopting a multi-view data model, we identify the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as a critical factor affecting forgetting. Focusing on task-incremental binary classification across $M$ tasks, our analysis verifies two key conclusions: (1) forgetting can still occur under full replay when the cumulative noise from later tasks dominates the signal from earlier ones; and (2) with sufficient signal accumulation, data replay can recover earlier tasks-even if their initial learning was poor. Notably, we uncover a novel insight into task ordering: prioritizing higher-signal tasks not only facilitates learning of lower-signal tasks but also helps prevent catastrophic forgetting. We validate our theoretical findings through synthetic and real-world experiments that visualize the interplay between signal learning and noise memorization across varying SNRs and task correlation regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4ece\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u89d2\u5ea6\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u5168\u6570\u636e\u56de\u653e\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\uff08SNR\uff09\u662f\u5f71\u54cd\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5373\u4f7f\u5168\u6570\u636e\u56de\u653e\u4e0b\u9057\u5fd8\u4ecd\u53ef\u80fd\u53d1\u751f\uff0c\u4f46\u5145\u5206\u4fe1\u53f7\u79ef\u7d2f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6062\u590d\u65e9\u671f\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f18\u5148\u8bad\u7ec3\u9ad8\u4fe1\u53f7\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u65b0\u6392\u5e8f\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\uff08CL\uff09\u4e2d\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u662f\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u56de\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u662f\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u5168\u6570\u636e\u56de\u653e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6709\u6548\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u89d2\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u5168\u6570\u636e\u56de\u653e\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ece\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u89d2\u5efa\u7acb\u5168\u6570\u636e\u56de\u653e\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8M\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u589e\u91cf\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fe1\u53f7\u566a\u58f0\u6bd4\uff08SNR\uff09\u5206\u6790\u9057\u5fd8\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u7814\u7a76\u4efb\u52a1\u6392\u5e8f\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff1a1\uff09\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5168\u6570\u636e\u56de\u653e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5f53\u540e\u7eed\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u566a\u58f0\u4e3b\u5bfc\u65e9\u671f\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u65f6\u4ecd\u4f1a\u53d1\u751f\u9057\u5fd8\uff1b2\uff09\u5145\u5206\u4fe1\u53f7\u79ef\u7d2f\u53ef\u4f7f\u6570\u636e\u56de\u653e\u8fdb\u65e9\u671f\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5176\u521d\u59cb\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff1b3\uff09\u4f18\u5148\u8bad\u7ec3\u9ad8\u4fe1\u53f7\u4efb\u52a1\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u4f4e\u4fe1\u53f7\u4efb\u52a1\u5e76\u9632\u6b62\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5168\u6570\u636e\u56de\u653e\u5e76\u975e\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4e07\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u5728\u51b3\u5b9a\u9057\u5fd8\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4e2d\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u5408\u7406\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u6392\u5e8f\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u4f18\u5148\u9ad8\u4fe1\u53f7\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u5b66\u4e60\u6548\u679c\u548c\u51cf\u8f7b\u9057\u5fd8\u3002\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose Constrained Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (CDGS), a novel framework that formulates dynamic scene reconstruction as a budget-constrained optimization problem to enforce a strict, user-defined Gaussian budget during training. Our key insight is to introduce a differentiable budget controller as the core optimization driver. Guided by a multi-modal unified importance score, this controller fuses geometric, motion, and perceptual cues for precise capacity regulation. To maximize the utility of this fixed budget, we further decouple the optimization of static and dynamic elements, employing an adaptive allocation mechanism that dynamically distributes capacity based on motion complexity. Furthermore, we implement a three-phase training strategy to seamlessly integrate these constraints, ensuring precise adherence to the target count. Coupled with a dual-mode hybrid compression scheme, CDGS not only strictly adheres to hardware constraints (error < 2%}) but also pushes the Pareto frontier of rate-distortion performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDGS delivers optimal rendering quality under varying capacity limits, achieving over 3x compression compared to state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCDGS\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u6784\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u6570\u91cf\u9884\u7b97\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u9ad8\u65af\u55b7\u6d12\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u52a8\u6001\u9ad8\u65af\u55b7\u6d12\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f4D\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u4e00\u4e2a\u6839\u672c\u6027\u56f0\u5883\uff1a\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5bc6\u5316\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u8fc7\u5927\u4e0d\u517c\u5bb9\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\uff0c\u800c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u526a\u679d\u5728\u9884\u8bbe\u9ad8\u65af\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u9884\u7b97\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6838\u5fc3\u4f18\u5316\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7edf\u4e00\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\uff1b\u89e3\u8026\u9759\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\uff1b\u5b9e\u65bd\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u6574\u5408\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b\u914d\u5408\u53cc\u6a21\u5f0f\u6df7\u5408\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "result": "CDGS\u80fd\u591f\u4e25\u683c\u9075\u5faa\u786c\u4ef6\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u8bef\u5dee<2%\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u901f\u7387\u5931\u771f\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5bb9\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc73\u500d\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "CDGS\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u9ad8\u65af\u55b7\u6d12\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4e25\u683c\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u9ad8\u65af\u9884\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u76844D\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recently, deep learning (DL) based segmentation models have shown the capacity to accomplish such a task. However, the training of the segmentation networks requires large amount of data with manual annotations, which is a major concern due to the data scarcity from clinic. Working with limited data is still common for researches on novel imaging modalities. To enhance the effectiveness of DL models trained with limited data, data augmentation (DA) is a crucial regularization technique. Traditional DA (TDA) strategies focus on basic intra-image operations, i.e. generating images with different orientations and intensity distributions. In contrast, the interimage and object-level DA operations are able to create new images from separate individuals. However, such DA strategies are not well explored on the task of multi-organ segmentation. In this paper, we investigated four possible inter-image DA strategies: CutMix, CarveMix, ObjectAug and AnatoMix, on two organ segmentation datasets. The result shows that CutMix, CarveMix and AnatoMix can improve the average dice score by 4.9, 2.0 and 1.9, compared with the state-of-the-art nnUNet without DA strategies. These results can be further improved by adding TDA strategies. It is revealed in our experiments that Cut-Mix is a robust but simple DA strategy to drive up the segmentation performance for multi-organ segmentation, even when CutMix produces intuitively 'wrong' images.

To address this, we present ELIQ, a Label-free Framework for Quality Assessment of Evolving AI-generated Images. Specifically, ELIQ focuses on visual quality and prompt-image alignment, automatically constructs positive and aspect-specific negative pairs to cover both conventional distortions and AIGC-specific distortion modes, enabling transferable supervision without human annotations. Building on these pairs, ELIQ adapts a pre-trained multimodal model into a quality-aware critic via instruction tuning and predicts two-dimensional quality using lightweight gated fusion and a Quality Query Transformer. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that ELIQ consistently outperforms existing label-free methods, generalizes from AI-generated content (AIGC) to user-generated content (UGC) scenarios without modification, and paves the way for scalable and label-free quality assessment under continuously evolving generative models.

We propose Cross-Temporal Attention Fusion (CTAF), a self-supervised module that learns soft bidirectional alignments between modalities and builds a robust clip embedding using time-aware cross attention, a lightweight fusion gate, and alignment-regularized contrastive objectives with optional weak supervision. On the K-EmoCon dataset, under leave-one-out cross-validation evaluation, CTAF yields higher cosine margins for matched pairs and better cross-modal token retrieval within one second, and it is competitive with the baseline on three-bin accuracy and macro-F1 while using few labels. Our contributions are a time-aware fusion mechanism that directly models correspondence, an alignment-driven self-supervised objective tailored to EEG and physiology, and an evaluation protocol that measures alignment quality itself. Our approach accounts for the coupling between the central and autonomic nervous systems in psychophysiological time series.

However, current Vid-LLMs struggle to simultaneously retain high-quality frame-level semantic information (i.e., a sufficient number of tokens per frame) and comprehensive video-level temporal information (i.e., an adequate number of sampled frames per video). This limitation hinders the advancement of Vid-LLMs towards fine-grained video understanding. To address this issue, we introduce the SlowFocus mechanism, which significantly enhances the equivalent sampling frequency without compromising the quality of frame-level visual tokens. SlowFocus begins by identifying the query-related temporal segment based on the posed question, then performs dense sampling on this segment to extract local high-frequency features. A multi-frequency mixing attention module is further leveraged to aggregate these local high-frequency details with global low-frequency contexts for enhanced temporal comprehension. Additionally, to tailor Vid-LLMs to this innovative mechanism, we introduce a set of training strategies aimed at bolstering both temporal grounding and detailed temporal reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we establish FineAction-CGR, a benchmark specifically devised to assess the ability of Vid-LLMs to process fine-grained temporal understanding tasks.

Current methods mainly rely on large-scale supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, this paradigm suffers from heavy data dependence and limited scalability against the rapid evolution of MLLMs. Although recent zero-shot approaches offer a flexible alternative, their performance remains significantly behind SFT-based methods, due to the straightforward workflow designs. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{Refer-Agent}, a collaborative multi-agent system with alternating reasoning-reflection mechanisms. This system decomposes RVOS into step-by-step reasoning process. During reasoning, we introduce a Coarse-to-Fine frame selection strategy to ensure the frame diversity and textual relevance, along with a Dynamic Focus Layout that adaptively adjusts the agent's visual focus. Furthermore, we propose a Chain-of-Reflection mechanism, which employs a Questioner-Responder pair to generate a self-reflection chain, enabling the system to verify intermediate results and generates feedback for next-round reasoning refinement. Extensive experiments on five challenging benchmarks demonstrate that Refer-Agent significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, including both SFT-based models and zero-shot approaches. Moreover, Refer-Agent is flexible and enables fast integration of new MLLMs without any additional fine-tuning costs.

JEPAs learn to predict in representation space rather than pixel space, avoiding the pitfalls of generative modeling while capturing semantically meaningful features suitable for downstream tasks. Our library provides modular, self-contained implementations that illustrate how representation learning techniques developed for image-level self-supervised learning can transfer to video, where temporal dynamics add complexity, and ultimately to action-conditioned world models, where the model must additionally learn to predict the effects of control inputs. Each example is designed for single-GPU training within a few hours, making energy-based self-supervised learning accessible for research and education. We provide ablations of JEA components on CIFAR-10. Probing these representations yields 91% accuracy, indicating that the model learns useful features. Extending to video, we include a multi-step prediction example on Moving MNIST that demonstrates how the same principles scale to temporal modeling. Finally, we show how these representations can drive action-conditioned world models, achieving a 97% planning success rate on the Two Rooms navigation task.

Standard evaluation requires repeated retraining, which is computationally costly for large models. One-run methods (single training with randomized data inclusion) and zero-run methods (post hoc evaluation) are often used instead, though their statistical validity remains unclear. To address this gap, we frame MIA evaluation as a causal inference problem, defining memorization as the causal effect of including a data point in the training set. This novel formulation reveals and formalizes key sources of bias in existing protocols: one-run methods suffer from interference between jointly included points, while zero-run evaluations popular for LLMs are confounded by non-random membership assignment. We derive causal analogues of standard MIA metrics and propose practical estimators for multi-run, one-run, and zero-run regimes with non-asymptotic consistency guarantees. Experiments on real-world data show that our approach enables reliable memorization measurement even when retraining is impractical and under distribution shift, providing a principled foundation for privacy evaluation in modern AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u4e3a\u5355\u6b21\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u96f6\u6b21\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u8bc4\u4f30\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u590d\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u6b21\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u96f6\u6b21\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u7edf\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u8bc4\u4f30\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u6807\u51c6\u56e0\u679cMIA\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u591a\u8f6e\u3001\u5355\u6b21\u548c\u96f6\u6b21\u8bad\u7ec3\u573a\u666f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u6cd5\u91cd\u590d\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5316\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u4ee3AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u9690\u79c1\u8bc4\u4f30\u5960\u5b9a\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u9650\u5236\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, this paradigm often suffers from severe visual redundancy and high computational overhead, especially when processing long videos. Crucially, existing keyframe selection strategies, especially those based on CLIP similarity, are prone to biases and may inadvertently overlook critical frames, resulting in suboptimal video comprehension. To address these significant challenges, we propose \\textbf{KTV}, a novel two-stage framework for efficient and effective training-free video understanding. In the first stage, KTV performs question-agnostic keyframe selection by clustering frame-level visual features, yielding a compact, diverse, and representative subset of frames that mitigates temporal redundancy. In the second stage, KTV applies key visual token selection, pruning redundant or less informative tokens from each selected keyframe based on token importance and redundancy, which significantly reduces the number of tokens fed into the LLM. Extensive experiments on the Multiple-Choice VideoQA task demonstrate that KTV outperforms state-of-the-art training-free baselines while using significantly fewer visual tokens, \\emph{e.g.}, only 504 visual tokens for a 60-min video with 10800 frames, achieving $44.8\\%$ accuracy on the MLVU-Test benchmark.

A core challenge is that the numerical, geometric parameters, which make up a large proportion of SVGs, are inefficiently encoded as long sequences of tokens. This slows training, reduces accuracy, and hurts generalization. To address these problems, we propose Continuous Number Modeling (CNM), an approach that directly models numbers as first-class, continuous values rather than discrete tokens. This formulation restores the mathematical elegance of the representation by aligning the model's inputs with the data's continuous nature, removing discretization artifacts introduced by token-based encoding. We then train a multimodal transformer on 2 million raster-to-SVG samples, followed by fine-tuning via reinforcement learning using perceptual feedback to further improve visual quality. Our approach improves training speed by over 30% while maintaining higher perceptual fidelity compared to alternative approaches.

Specifically, the synthesized multimodal data incorporates fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), multispectral imaging (MSI), and saliency maps that emphasize latent lesions as well as optic disc/cup regions. Parallel models are independently trained to learn modality-specific representations that capture cross-pathophysiological signatures. These features are then adaptively calibrated within and across modalities to perform information pruning and flexible integration according to downstream tasks.

However, standard aggregation methods like majority voting or individual confidence-based filtering face a fundamental \"blind spot\": they evaluate each trace in isolation. As problems scale in difficulty, models often generate hallucinated paths that exhibit misleadingly high confidence, causing the true solution to be suppressed by a narrow margin in traditional voting. We ask: can we enable traces to \"peer-review\" each other to resolve these near-miss errors?\n  We introduce Packet-Conditioned Revision (PACER), a training-free, inference-only framework that enables reasoning traces to revise their conclusions through a structured coordination step. After a preliminary screening of generated traces, PACER constructs a compact consensus packet containing (i) unique candidate answers, (ii) their aggregated confidence scores, and (iii) representative reasoning summaries for each candidate answer.

Additionally, the search space of the dynamic graphs is combinatorial in nature. In this study, we propose \\textit{Stable Causal Dynamic Differentiable Discovery (SC3D)}, a two-stage differentiable framework that jointly learns lag-specific adjacency matrices and, if present, an instantaneous directed acyclic graph (DAG). In Stage 1, SC3D performs edge preselection through node-wise prediction to obtain masks for lagged and instantaneous edges, whereas Stage 2 refines these masks by optimizing a likelihood with sparsity along with enforcing acyclicity on the instantaneous block. Numerical results across synthetic and benchmark dynamical systems demonstrate that SC3D achieves improved stability and more accurate recovery of both lagged and instantaneous causal structures compared to existing temporal baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This is particularly crucial in the remote sensing domain, where the dense object distribution and a wide variety of categories contribute to prohibitively high costs. Based on the supervision level, existing oriented object detection algorithms can be broadly grouped into fully supervised, semi-supervised, and weakly supervised methods. Within the scope of this work, we further categorize them to include sparsely supervised and partially weakly-supervised methods. To address the challenges of large-scale labeling, we introduce the first Sparse Partial Weakly-Supervised Oriented Object Detection framework, designed to efficiently leverage only a few sparse weakly-labeled data and plenty of unlabeled data. Our framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) We design a Sparse-annotation-Orientation-and-Scale-aware Student (SOS-Student) model to separate unlabeled objects from the background in a sparsely-labeled setting, and learn orientation and scale information from orientation-agnostic or scale-agnostic weak annotations. (2) We construct a novel Multi-level Pseudo-label Filtering strategy that leverages the distribution of model predictions, which is informed by the model's multi-layer predictions. (3) We propose a unique sparse partitioning approach, ensuring equal treatment for each category. Extensive experiments on the DOTA and DIOR datasets show that our framework achieves a significant performance gain over traditional oriented object detection methods mentioned above, offering a highly cost-effective solution.

However, classical approaches which perform autoregressive rollouts often trade off between strong short-term accuracy and long-horizon stability. Koopman autoencoders, inspired by Koopman operator theory, provide a physics-based alternative by mapping nonlinear dynamics into a latent space where linear evolution is conducted. In practice, most existing formulations operate in a discrete-time setting, limiting temporal flexibility. In this work, we introduce a continuous-time Koopman framework that models latent evolution through numerical integration schemes. By allowing variable timesteps at inference, the method demonstrates robustness to temporal resolution and generalizes beyond training regimes. In addition, the learned dynamics closely adhere to the analytical matrix exponential solution, enabling efficient long-horizon forecasting.

GeLDA conditions generation on auxiliary feature vectors that capture semantic relationships among classes or subdomains, facilitating data augmentation in low-resource domains.

RIAS generates precise masks from text descriptions without manual thresholds and uses universal prompts to detect diverse anomalies with a single model. We introduce the MVTec-Ref dataset to support this, designed with diverse referring expressions and focusing on anomaly patterns, notably with 95% small anomalies. We also propose the Dual Query Token with Mask Group Transformer (DQFormer) benchmark, enhanced by Language-Gated Multi-Level Aggregation (LMA) to improve multi-scale segmentation.

These algorithms build on standard policy gradients, which assume that there is no unmeasured confounding in the data. However, this condition does not necessarily hold for pixel-based demonstrations when a mismatch exists between the demonstrator's and the learner's sensory capabilities, leading to implicit confounding biases in offline data. We address the challenge by investigating the problem of confounded observations in offline RL from a causal perspective. We develop a novel causal offline RL objective that optimizes policies' worst-case performance that may arise due to confounding biases. Based on this new objective, we introduce a practical implementation that learns expressive flow-matching policies from confounded demonstrations, employing a deep discriminator to assess the discrepancy between the target policy and the nominal behavioral policy.

To address this limitation, we introduce a new multi-round visual reasoning benchmark with training and test sets spanning both detection and segmentation tasks, enabling systematic evaluation under iterative reasoning scenarios. We further propose RegionReasoner, a reinforcement learning framework that enforces grounded reasoning by requiring each reasoning trace to explicitly cite the corresponding reference bounding boxes, while maintaining semantic coherence via a global-local consistency reward.

SVD-based compression reduces storage and can speed up inference via low-rank factors, yet performance depends on how rank is allocated under a global compression ratio. Prior methods often use homogeneous ranks for similarly sized matrices, despite large differences in loss sensitivity, or rely on expensive iterative pre-truncation optimization to determine per matrix ranks. We propose \\textbf{Zero Sum SVD} (\\textbf{ZS-SVD}), a post-training method that performs \\emph{global} singular component selection using activation whitening and first-order calibration loss estimates in whitened coordinates. \\textbf{ZS-SVD} prunes components across the whole model with a \\textbf{zero sum} rule that keeps the cumulative predicted loss change near zero, automatically yielding heterogeneous ranks without solving a rank allocation optimization. Motivated by evidence that gradients near pretrained solutions exhibit low rank structure, we also introduce an optional lightweight correction that applies a \\textbf{single} projected gradient update after truncation, followed by re-truncation.

Although robotic platforms equipped with visual sensors can efficiently detect structural deficiencies, the automated generation of human-readable summaries from these detections remains a significant challenge, especially on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper presents a novel two-stage pipeline for end-to-end summarization of underground deficiencies, combining our lightweight RAPID-SCAN segmentation model with a fine-tuned Vision-Language Model (VLM) deployed on an edge computing platform. The first stage employs RAPID-SCAN (Resource-Aware Pipeline Inspection and Defect Segmentation using Compact Adaptive Network), achieving 0.834 F1-score with only 0.64M parameters for efficient defect segmentation. The second stage utilizes a fine-tuned Phi-3.5 VLM that generates concise, domain-specific summaries in natural language from the segmentation outputs. We introduce a curated dataset of inspection images with manually verified descriptions for VLM fine-tuning and evaluation. To enable real-time performance, we employ post-training quantization with hardware-specific optimization, achieving significant reductions in model size and inference latency without compromising summarization quality. We deploy and evaluate our complete pipeline on a mobile robotic platform, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world inspection scenarios.

Prior work addresses these limitations by relaxing strict equivariance during training, but typically relies on prespecified, explicit, or implicit target levels of relaxation for each network layer, which are task-dependent and costly to tune. We propose Recurrent Equivariant Constraint Modulation (RECM), a layer-wise constraint modulation mechanism that learns appropriate relaxation levels solely from the training signal and the symmetry properties of each layer's input-target distribution, without requiring any prior knowledge about the task-dependent target relaxation level. We demonstrate that under the proposed RECM update, the relaxation level of each layer provably converges to a value upper-bounded by its symmetry gap, namely the degree to which its input-target distribution deviates from exact symmetry. Consequently, layers processing symmetric distributions recover full equivariance, while those with approximate symmetries retain sufficient flexibility to learn non-symmetric solutions when warranted by the data. Empirically, RECM outperforms prior methods across diverse exact and approximate equivariant tasks, including the challenging molecular conformer generation on the GEOM-Drugs dataset.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we propose LIVE, a Long-horizon Interactive Video world modEl that enforces bounded error accumulation via a novel cycle-consistency objective, thereby eliminating the need for teacher-based distillation. Specifically, LIVE first performs a forward rollout from ground-truth frames and then applies a reverse generation process to reconstruct the initial state. The diffusion loss is subsequently computed on the reconstructed terminal state, providing an explicit constraint on long-horizon error propagation.

Leveraging a summary statistics description of the fine-tuning dynamics, we precisely characterize how the convergence rate depends on the initial fine-tuning alignment and the degree of non-linearity of the target task. The key take away is that even when the pre-training and down- stream tasks are well aligned, strong pre-training can induce a prolonged search phase and hinder convergence.

To address the scarcity of training data, we introduce a scalable engine that bootstraps high-quality supervision from commercial Live2D models, capturing pixel-perfect semantics and hidden geometry.

We identify a previously unreported third phase of grokking in this training regime: \\emph{anti-grokking}, a late-stage collapse of generalization.\n  We revisit two canonical grokking setups: a 3-layer MLP trained on a subset of MNIST and a transformer trained on modular addition, but extended training far beyond standard. In both cases, after models transition from pre-grokking to successful generalization, test accuracy collapses back to chance while training accuracy remains perfect, indicating a distinct post-generalization failure mode.\n  To diagnose anti-grokking, we use the open-source \\texttt{WeightWatcher} tool based on HTSR/SETOL theory. The primary signal is the emergence of \\emph{Correlation Traps}: anomalously large eigenvalues beyond the Marchenko--Pastur bulk in the empirical spectral density of shuffled weight matrices, which are predicted to impair generalization. As a secondary signal, anti-grokking corresponds to the average HTSR layer quality metric $\u03b1$ deviating from $2.0$. Neither metric requires access to the test or training data.\n  We compare these signals to alternative grokking diagnostic, including $\\ell_2$ norms, Activation Sparsity, Absolute Weight Entropy, and Local Circuit Complexity. These track pre-grokking and grokking but fail to identify anti-grokking.

The Log-E-Exp formulation serves as an abstraction of the Log-Sum-Exponential (LogSumExp) function when the explicit summation inside the logarithm is taken over a gigantic number of items and is therefore expensive to evaluate. While entropic risk objectives of this form arise in many machine learning problems, existing optimization algorithms suffer from several fundamental limitations including non-convergence, numerical instability, and slow convergence rates. To address these limitations, we propose a geometry-aware stochastic algorithm, termed $\\textbf{SCENT}$, for the dual formulation of entropic risk minimization cast as a min--min optimization problem. The key to our design is a $\\textbf{stochastic proximal mirror descent (SPMD)}$ update for the dual variable, equipped with a Bregman divergence induced by a negative exponential function that faithfully captures the geometry of the objective. Our main contributions are threefold: (i) we establish an $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate of the proposed SCENT algorithm for convex problems; (ii) we theoretically characterize the advantages of SPMD over standard SGD update for optimizing the dual variable; and (iii) we demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of SCENT on extreme classification, partial AUC maximization, contrastive learning and distributionally robust optimization, where it consistently outperforms existing baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

By optimizing a similarity objective (the potential) at inference, we steer the denoising process toward a conditioned representation extracted from a pre-trained feature extractor. Our method provides versatile control at multiple scales, ranging from fine-grained texture matching via single patches to broad semantic guidance using global image feature tokens.

Intuitively, low-bit quantization is a prevalent and preferred technique for large-scale model compression. However, we find that a systematic analysis of VLA model's quantization is fundamentally lacking. We argue that naively applying uniform-bit quantization from Large Language Models (LLMs) to robotics is flawed, as these methods prioritize passive data fidelity while ignoring how minor action deviations compound into catastrophic task failures. To bridge this gap, we introduce QVLA, the first action-centric quantization framework specifically designed for embodied control. In a sharp departure from the rigid, uniform-bit quantization of LLM-based methods, QVLA introduces a highly granular, channel-wise bit allocation strategy. Its core mechanism is to directly measure the final action-space sensitivity when quantizing each individual channel to various bit-widths. This process yields a precise, per-channel importance metric that guides a global optimization, which elegantly unifies quantization and pruning (0-bit) into a single, cohesive framework. Extensive evaluations on different baselines demonstrate the superiority of our approach. In the LIBERO, the quantization version of OpenVLA-OFT with our method requires only 29.2% of the original model's VRAM while maintaining 98.9% of its original performance and achieving a 1.49x speedup.

We prove that these errors are not random noise but systematically align with the dominant Hessian subspace, acting as structured perturbations that guide optimization toward flatter minima.

We propose Manifold-Constrained Energy-based Transition Models (MC-ETM), which train conditional energy-based transition models using a manifold projection--diffusion negative sampler. MC-ETM learns a latent manifold of next states and generates near-manifold hard negatives by perturbing latent codes and running Langevin dynamics in latent space with the learned conditional energy, sharpening the energy landscape around the dataset support and improving sensitivity to subtle out-of-distribution deviations. For policy optimization, the learned energy provides a single reliability signal: rollouts are truncated when the minimum energy over sampled next states exceeds a threshold, and Bellman backups are stabilized via pessimistic penalties based on Q-value-level dispersion across energy-guided samples. We formalize MC-ETM through a hybrid pessimistic MDP formulation and derive a conservative performance bound separating in-support evaluation error from truncation risk.

One of the biggest challenges in developing health algorithms based on such biosignals is the sparsity of clinical labels, which makes biosignals temporally distant from lab draws less reliable for supervision. To address this problem, we introduce a simple training strategy that learns a biomarker-specific decay of sample weight over the time gap between a segment and its ground truth label and uses this weight in the loss with a regularizer to prevent trivial solutions. On smartwatch PPG from 450 participants across 10 biomarkers, the approach improves over baselines. In the subject-wise setting, the proposed approach averages 0.715 AUPRC, compared to 0.674 for a fine-tuned self-supervised baseline and 0.626 for a feature-based Random Forest. A comparison of four decay families shows that a simple linear decay function is most robust on average. Beyond accuracy, the learned decay rates summarize how quickly each biomarker's PPG evidence becomes stale, providing an interpretable view of temporal sensitivity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u7684PPG\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u53f7\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e34\u5e8a\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u758f\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u8bbe\u5907\u548cAI\u6280\u672f\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8ePPG\u7684\u5065\u5eb7\u76d1\u6d4b\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u4e34\u5e8a\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u4f7f\u5f97\u8fdc\u79bb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u91c7\u8840\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\u7684\u751f\u7269\u4fe1\u53f7\u76d1\u7763\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7b80\u5355\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u51fd\u6570\uff08\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u95f4\u9694\u8870\u51cf\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u52a0\u6743\u5e76\u6dfb\u52a0\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u9632\u6b62\u5e73\u51e1\u89e3\u3002\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u8870\u51cf\u51fd\u6570\u65cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728450\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u768410\u79cd\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269PPG\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747AUPRC\u8fbe\u52300.715\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\uff080.674\uff09\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\uff080.626\uff09\u3002\u7ebf\u6027\u8870\u51cf\u51fd\u6570\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u7a33\u5065\u3002\u8870\u51cf\u7387\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u7684PPG\u8bc1\u636e\u65f6\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u52a0\u6743\u7b56\u7565\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u7a00\u758f\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0bPPG\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8870\u51cf\u7387\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u6807\u5fd7\u7269\u65f6\u654f\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

Its clinical outcome can be substantially improved through early detection and timely intervention. By leveraging publicly available datasets, machine learning (ML) has driven advances in both research and clinical practice. However, existing public datasets consider ICU patients (Intensive Care Unit) as a uniform group and neglect the potential challenges presented by critically ill trauma patients in whom injury-related inflammation and organ dysfunction can overlap with the clinical features of sepsis. We propose that a targeted identification of post-traumatic sepsis is necessary in order to develop methods for early detection. Therefore, we introduce a publicly available standardized post-trauma sepsis onset dataset extracted, relabeled using standardized post-trauma clinical facts, and validated from MIMIC-III. Furthermore, we frame early detection of post-trauma sepsis onset according to clinical workflow in ICUs in a daily basis resulting in a new rare event detection problem. We then establish a general benchmark through comprehensive experiments, which shows the necessity of further advancements using this new dataset. The data code is available at https://github.com/ML4UWHealth/SepsisOnset_TraumaCohort.git.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
