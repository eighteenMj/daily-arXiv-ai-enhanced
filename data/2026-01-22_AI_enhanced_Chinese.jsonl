Given only the sensitivity of a query and a norm-monotone cost function measuring utility loss, we ask which noise distribution minimizes expected cost among all additive $\u03b5$-DP mechanisms. Using convex rearrangement theory, we show that this infinite-dimensional optimization problem admits a reduction to a one-dimensional compact and convex family of radially symmetric distributions whose extreme points are the staircase distributions. As a consequence, we prove that for any dimension, any norm, and any norm-monotone cost function, there exists an $\u03b5$-DP staircase mechanism that is optimal among all additive mechanisms. This result resolves a conjecture of Geng, Kairouz, Oh, and Viswanath, and provides a geometric explanation for the emergence of staircase mechanisms as extremal solutions in differential privacy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Inf. Theory", "summary": "This paper addresses the estimation of signals with sublinear sparsity sent over the additive white Gaussian noise channel. This fundamental problem arises in designing denoisers used in message-passing algorithms for sublinear sparsity. The main results are direct and converse theorems in the sublinear sparsity limit, where the signal sparsity grows sublinearly in the signal dimension as the signal dimension tends to infinity. As a direct theorem, the maximum likelihood estimator is proved to achieve vanishing square error in the sublinear sparsity limit if the noise variance is smaller than a threshold. As a converse theorem, all estimators cannot achieve square errors smaller than the signal power under a mild condition if the noise variance is larger than another threshold. In particular, the two thresholds coincide with each other when non-zero signals have constant amplitude. These results imply the asymptotic optimality of an existing separable Bayesian estimator used in approximate message-passing for sublinear sparsity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A $(t,s)$-BRC guarantees correct decoding of the original message even after up to~$t$ arbitrary breaks of the codeword and the complete loss of some fragments whose total length is at most~$s$. This model unifies and generalizes previous approaches, extending break-resilient codes (which handle arbitrary fragmentation without fragment loss) and deletion codes (which correct bit losses in unknown positions without fragmentation) into a single information-theoretic framework.

The classical AC OPF relies on trigonometric coupling between bus voltage phasors, which yields a nonconvex program with oscillatory derivatives that can slow, or in some cases destabilize, interior-point methods. We replace the trigonometric terms with an all-pass fractional (APF) approximation whose real and imaginary components act as smooth surrogates for the cosine and sine functions, and we introduce a pre-rotation to shift the argument of the approximation toward its most accurate region, ensuring that the reformulated power flow model preserves physical loss behavior, maintains the symmetry of the classical kernels, and improves the conditioning of the Jacobian and Hessian matrices. The proposed APF OPF formulation remains nonconvex, as in the classical model, but it eliminates trigonometric evaluations and empirically produces larger and more stable Newton steps under standard interior-point solvers. Numerical results on more than 25 IEEE and PGLib test systems ranging from 9 to 10{,}000 buses demonstrate that the APF OPF model achieves solutions with accuracy comparable to that of the classical formulation while reducing solver times, indicating a more solver-friendly nonconvex representation of AC OPF.

Traditional methods often rely on iterative optimization, which is computationally intensive and lacks generalizability. Recent advances in deep learning have introduced attention-based mechanisms that improve feature alignment, yet accurately registering regions with high anatomical variability remains challenging. In this study, we proposed a novel unsupervised deformable image registration framework, LGANet++, which employs a novel local-global attention mechanism integrated with a unique technique for feature interaction and fusion to enhance registration accuracy, robustness, and generalizability. We evaluated our approach using five publicly available datasets, representing three distinct registration scenarios: cross-patient, cross-time, and cross-modal CT-MR registration. The results demonstrated that our approach consistently outperforms several state-of-the-art registration methods, improving registration accuracy by 1.39% in cross-patient registration, 0.71% in cross-time registration, and 6.12% in cross-modal CT-MR registration tasks.

However, existing systems often rely on single-modality analysis such as facial expressions, speech tone, or textual sentiment, resulting in limited robustness and poor generalization in real-world environments. To address these challenges, this study proposes a Cloud-Based Cross-Modal Transformer (CMT) framework for multimodal emotion recognition and adaptive human-computer interaction. The proposed model integrates visual, auditory, and textual signals using pretrained encoders (Vision Transformer, Wav2Vec2, and BERT) and employs a cross-modal attention mechanism to capture complex interdependencies among heterogeneous features. By leveraging cloud computing infrastructure with distributed training on Kubernetes and TensorFlow Serving, the system enables scalable, low-latency emotion recognition for large-scale user interactions. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets including IEMOCAP, MELD, and AffectNet demonstrate that the CMT achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving the F1-score by 3.0 percent and reducing cross-entropy loss by 12.9 percent compared to strong multimodal baselines. Additionally, cloud deployment evaluations show an average response latency of 128 ms, representing a 35 percent reduction compared with conventional transformer-based fusion systems. These results confirm that the proposed framework enables efficient, real-time emotion recognition and adaptive feedback in applications such as intelligent customer service, virtual tutoring systems, and affective computing interfaces, marking an important step toward cloud-native affective computing and emotionally intelligent interactive systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, this conventional architecture suffers from a fundamental limitation: the inability to perform parallel write operations due to the sneak path problem. This arises from the structural overlap of read and write paths, forcing sequential or semi-parallel updates and severely limiting scalability. To address this, we introduce a new memristor design that decouples read and write operations at the device level. This design enables orthogonal conductive paths, and employs a reversible ion doping mechanism, inspired by lithium-ion battery principles, to modulate resistance states independently of computation. Fabricated devices exhibit near-ideal memristive characteristics and stable performance under isolated read/write conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Yet their belief-forming behavior is governed by implicit, uninspected epistemic policies. This paper argues for an epistemic constitution for AI: explicit, contestable meta-norms that regulate how systems form and express beliefs. Source attribution bias provides the motivating case: I show that frontier models enforce identity-stance coherence, penalizing arguments attributed to sources whose expected ideological position conflicts with the argument's content. When models detect systematic testing, these effects collapse, revealing that systems treat source-sensitivity as bias to suppress rather than as a capacity to execute well. I distinguish two constitutional approaches: the Platonic, which mandates formal correctness and default source-independence from a privileged standpoint, and the Liberal, which refuses such privilege, specifying procedural norms that protect conditions for collective inquiry while allowing principled source-attending grounded in epistemic vigilance. I argue for the Liberal approach, sketch a constitutional core of eight principles and four orientations, and propose that AI epistemic governance requires the same explicit, contestable structure we now expect for AI ethics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u4e3b\u5f20\u4e3aAI\u5236\u5b9a\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u5baa\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u660e\u786e\u7684\u3001\u53ef\u4e89\u8bae\u7684\u5143\u89c4\u8303\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u7cfb\u7edf\u5982\u4f55\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u4fe1\u5ff5\u3002\u4ee5\u6e90\u5f52\u5c5e\u504f\u89c1\u4e3a\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u524d\u6cbf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u4e3a\u4eba-\u7acb\u573a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f1a\u60e9\u7f5a\u90a3\u4e9b\u5f52\u5c5e\u4e8e\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u7acb\u573a\u4e0e\u8bba\u70b9\u5185\u5bb9\u76f8\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u8bba\u70b9\u3002\u5f53\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6548\u5e94\u4f1a\u6d88\u5931\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u67cf\u62c9\u56fe\u5f0f\u548c\u81ea\u7531\u4e3b\u4e49\u4e24\u79cd\u5baa\u6cd5\u8fdb\u8def\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u540e\u8005\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u516b\u9879\u539f\u5219\u548c\u56db\u79cd\u503e\u5411\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u5baa\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4eba\u5de5\u63a8\u7406\u8005\u8fd0\u4f5c\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bba\u70b9\u3001\u5206\u914d\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u5e76\u8868\u8fbe\u4fe1\u5fc3\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5f62\u6210\u884c\u4e3a\u53d7\u9690\u6666\u7684\u3001\u672a\u53d7\u68c0\u89c6\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u7b56\u7565\u652f\u914d\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u9700\u8981\u4e3aAI\u5efa\u7acb\u660e\u786e\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u5baa\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u8fc7\u7a0b\u53ef\u5ba1\u89c6\u548c\u53ef\u4e89\u8bae\u3002\u6e90\u5f52\u5c5e\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bba\u70b9\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u8fd9\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u5efa\u7acb\u89c4\u8303\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u7d27\u8feb\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6e90\u5f52\u5c5e\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6848\u4f8b\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u524d\u6cbf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u4e3a\u4eba-\u7acb\u573a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u60e9\u7f5a\u90a3\u4e9b\u5f52\u5c5e\u4e8e\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u7acb\u573a\u4e0e\u8bba\u70b9\u5185\u5bb9\u76f8\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u8bba\u70b9\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6548\u5e94\u4f1a\u6d88\u5931\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0a\uff0c\u8bba\u6587\u533a\u5206\u5e76\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u5baa\u6cd5\u8fdb\u8def\uff1a\u67cf\u62c9\u56fe\u5f0f\u8fdb\u8def\uff08\u5f3a\u8c03\u5f62\u5f0f\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9ed8\u8ba4\u7684\u6e90\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\uff09\u548c\u81ea\u7531\u4e3b\u4e49\u8fdb\u8def\uff08\u62d2\u7edd\u7279\u6743\u7acb\u573a\uff0c\u5236\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u89c4\u8303\u4fdd\u62a4\u96c6\u4f53\u63a2\u7a76\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5141\u8bb8\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u8b66\u60d5\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6e90\u5173\u6ce8\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u524d\u6cbf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u6e90\u5f52\u5c5e\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u4e3a\u4eba-\u7acb\u573a\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bba\u70b9\u65f6\u4f1a\u8003\u8651\u6765\u6e90\u7684\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001\u7acb\u573a\u3002\u6709\u8da3\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5f53\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u504f\u89c1\u6548\u5e94\u4f1a\u6d88\u5931\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c06\u6e90\u654f\u611f\u6027\u89c6\u4e3a\u9700\u8981\u6291\u5236\u7684\u504f\u89c1\u800c\u975e\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u7531\u4e3b\u4e49\u5baa\u6cd5\u8fdb\u8def\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u516b\u9879\u539f\u5219\u548c\u56db\u79cd\u503e\u5411\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u5baa\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u8ba4\u4e3a\uff0cAI\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u6cbb\u7406\u9700\u8981\u7c7b\u4f3c\u4e8e\u5f53\u524dAI\u4f26\u7406\u6240\u671f\u671b\u7684\u660e\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u4e89\u8bae\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u7531\u4e3b\u4e49\u5baa\u6cd5\u8fdb\u8def\uff0c\u62d2\u7edd\u7279\u6743\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u7acb\u573a\uff0c\u4e3b\u5f20\u5236\u5b9a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u89c4\u8303\u6765\u4fdd\u62a4\u96c6\u4f53\u63a2\u7a76\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5141\u8bb8\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u8b66\u60d5\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6e90\u5173\u6ce8\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5baa\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u65e8\u5728\u4e3aAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u8868\u8fbe\u63d0\u4f9b\u660e\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u4e89\u8bae\u7684\u5143\u89c4\u8303\u3002"}}

These signals include modality-specific cues, information shared across modalities, and interactions that emerge only when modalities are combined. In information-theoretic terms, these correspond to \\emph{unique}, \\emph{redundant}, and \\emph{synergistic} contributions. An ideal representation should leverage all three, yet achieving such balance remains challenging. Recent advances in contrastive learning and augmentation-based methods have made progress, but they often overlook the role of data preparation in preserving these components. In particular, applying augmentations directly to raw inputs or fused embeddings can blur the boundaries between modality-unique and cross-modal signals. To address this challenge, we propose a two-phase framework \\emph{\\textbf{D}ivide and \\textbf{R}efine} (\\textbf{DnR}). In the \\textbf{Divide} phase, each modality is explicitly decomposed into uniqueness, pairwise redundancy, and synergy. In the \\textbf{Refine} phase, tailored objectives enhance the informativeness of these components while maintaining their distinct roles. The refined representations are plug-and-play compatible with diverse multimodal pipelines. Extensive experiments on IEMOCAP and MELD demonstrate consistent improvements across multiple MERC backbones. These results highlight the effectiveness of explicitly dividing, refining, and recombining multimodal representations as a principled strategy for advancing emotion recognition.

Deep learning has significantly advanced automatic segmentation methodologies by providing superior modeling capability for complex structures and fine-grained anatomical regions. However, medical images often suffer from data imbalance issues, such as large volume disparities among organs or tissues, and uneven sample distributions across different anatomical structures. This imbalance tends to bias the model toward larger organs or more frequently represented structures, while overlooking smaller or less represented structures, thereby affecting the segmentation accuracy and robustness. To address these challenges, we proposed a novel contour-weighted segmentation approach, which improves the model's capability to represent small and underrepresented structures. We developed PDANet, a lightweight and efficient segmentation network based on a partial decoder mechanism. We evaluated our method using three prominent public datasets. The experimental results show that our methodology excelled in three distinct tasks: segmenting multiple abdominal organs, brain tumors, and pelvic bone fragments with injuries. It consistently outperformed nine state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the proposed contour-weighted strategy improved segmentation for other comparison methods across the three datasets, yielding average enhancements in Dice scores of 2.32%, 1.67%, and 3.60%, respectively. These results demonstrate that our contour-weighted segmentation method surpassed current leading approaches in both accuracy and robustness. As a model-independent strategy, it can seamlessly fit various segmentation frameworks, enhancing their performance. This flexibility highlighted its practical importance and potential for broad use in medical image analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, current automated systems struggle with ultra-high-resolution drawings due to high computational demands, information loss, and a lack of holistic semantic understanding for design error identification. This paper proposes a novel three-stage framework for intelligent power grid drawing review, driven by pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) through advanced prompt engineering. Mimicking the human expert review process, the first stage leverages an MLLM for global semantic understanding to intelligently propose domain-specific semantic regions from a low-resolution overview. The second stage then performs high-resolution, fine-grained recognition within these proposed regions, acquiring detailed information with associated confidence scores. In the final stage, a comprehensive decision-making module integrates these confidence-aware results to accurately diagnose design errors and provide a reliability assessment. Preliminary results on real-world power grid drawings demonstrate our approach significantly enhances MLLM's ability to grasp macroscopic semantic information and pinpoint design errors, showing improved defect discovery accuracy and greater reliability in review judgments compared to traditional passive MLLM inference.

We empirically characterize this as a modality gap: the same question in text form yields markedly higher accuracy than its visually typeset counterpart, due to compounded failures in reading dense formulas, layout, and mixed symbolic-diagrammatic context. First, we introduce VisTIRA (Vision and Tool-Integrated Reasoning Agent), a tool-integrated reasoning framework that enables structured problem solving by iteratively decomposing a given math problem (as an image) into natural language rationales and executable Python steps to determine the final answer. Second, we build a framework to measure and improve visual math reasoning: a LaTeX-based pipeline that converts chain-of-thought math corpora (e.g., NuminaMath) into challenging image counterparts, and a large set of synthetic tool-use trajectories derived from a real-world, homework-style image dataset (called SnapAsk) for fine-tuning VLMs. Our experiments show that tool-integrated supervision improves image-based reasoning, and OCR grounding can further narrow the gap for smaller models, although its benefit diminishes at scale. These findings highlight that modality gap severity inversely correlates with model size, and that structured reasoning and OCR-based grounding are complementary strategies for advancing visual mathematical reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Moreover, algorithmic enhancements are embedded within the EIGP, including a greedy algorithm (gEIGP) for accelerating prediction and an adaptive algorithm (aEIGP) for improving prediction accuracy. In addition, approaches for fast prediction and model update are introduced in conjunction with the error-informed quantification term iteration and a data deletion strategy to achieve real-time learning operations.

Existing reawakening methods mainly rely on prompt-level optimization to manipulate sampling trajectories, neglecting other generative factors, which limits a comprehensive understanding of the underlying dynamics. In this paper, we model the generation process as an implicit function to enable a comprehensive theoretical analysis of multiple factors, including text conditions, model parameters, and latent states. We theoretically show that perturbing each factor can reawaken erased concepts. Building on this insight, we propose a novel concept reawakening method: Latent space Unblocking for concept REawakening (LURE), which reawakens erased concepts by reconstructing the latent space and guiding the sampling trajectory. Specifically, our semantic re-binding mechanism reconstructs the latent space by aligning denoising predictions with target distributions to reestablish severed text-visual associations. However, in multi-concept scenarios, naive reconstruction can cause gradient conflicts and feature entanglement. To address this, we introduce Gradient Field Orthogonalization, which enforces feature orthogonality to prevent mutual interference. Additionally, our Latent Semantic Identification-Guided Sampling (LSIS) ensures stability of the reawakening process via posterior density verification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LURE enables simultaneous, high-fidelity reawakening of multiple erased concepts across diverse erasure tasks and methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Submitted to a conference implementing a double-blind review process", "summary": "Recent work shows that fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve high valid plan rates on PDDL planning tasks. However, it remains unclear whether this reflects transferable planning competence or domain-specific memorization. In this work, we fine-tune a 1.7B-parameter LLM on 40,000 domain-problem-plan tuples from 10 IPC 2023 domains, and evaluate both in-domain and cross-domain generalization. While the model reaches 82.9% valid plan rate in in-domain conditions, it achieves 0% on two unseen domains. To analyze this failure, we introduce three diagnostic interventions, namely (i) instance-wise symbol anonymization, (ii) compact plan serialization, and (iii) verifier-reward fine-tuning using the VAL validator as a success-focused reinforcement signal. Symbol anonymization and compact serialization cause significant performance drops despite preserving plan semantics, thus revealing strong sensitivity to surface representations. Verifier-reward fine-tuning reaches performance saturation in half the supervised training epochs, but does not improve cross-domain generalization. For the explored configurations, in-domain performance plateaus around 80%, while cross-domain performance collapses, suggesting that our fine-tuned model relies heavily on domain-specific patterns rather than transferable planning competence in this setting. Our results highlight a persistent generalization gap in LLM-based planning and provide diagnostic tools for studying its causes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5728PDDL\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5728\u9886\u57df\u5185\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0882.9%\u6709\u6548\u89c4\u5212\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0a\u5b8c\u5168\u5931\u8d25\uff080%\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7b26\u53f7\u533f\u540d\u5316\u3001\u7d27\u51d1\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5956\u52b1\u5fae\u8c03\u7b49\u8bca\u65ad\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8868\u9762\u8868\u5f81\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u638c\u63e1\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684LLM\u5728PDDL\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u6709\u6548\u89c4\u5212\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u8fd9\u662f\u6e90\u4e8e\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u8fd8\u662f\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76LLM\u5728\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u662f\u5426\u771f\u6b63\u5177\u5907\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u572810\u4e2aIPC 2023\u9886\u57df\u768440,000\u4e2a\u9886\u57df-\u95ee\u9898-\u89c4\u5212\u5143\u7ec4\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c031.7B\u53c2\u6570LLM\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u8bca\u65ad\u5e72\u9884\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1a1\uff09\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u7b26\u53f7\u533f\u540d\u5316\uff1b2\uff09\u7d27\u51d1\u89c4\u5212\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\uff1b3\uff09\u4f7f\u7528VAL\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6210\u529f\u5bfc\u5411\u5f3a\u5316\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5956\u52b1\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9886\u57df\u5185\u8fbe\u523082.9%\u6709\u6548\u89c4\u5212\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u672a\u89c1\u9886\u57df\u4e0a\u4e3a0%\u3002\u7b26\u53f7\u533f\u540d\u5316\u548c\u7d27\u51d1\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5bf9\u8868\u9762\u8868\u5f81\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u3002\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5668\u5956\u52b1\u5fae\u8c03\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u534a\u8f6e\u6b21\u8fbe\u5230\u6027\u80fd\u9971\u548c\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u6539\u5584\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u5f0f\u800c\u975e\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u9886\u57df\u5185\u6027\u80fd\u7ea680%\u65f6\u8d8b\u4e8e\u9971\u548c\uff0c\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6027\u80fd\u5d29\u6e83\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u539f\u56e0\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

This work presents a first-principles framework inherent to Bayesian updating, termed information mechanics (infomechanics). Any pointwise reduction in posterior surprisal is exactly balanced by information gained from data, independently of algorithms, dynamics, or implementation. Imposing additivity, symmetry, and robustness collapses the freedom of this identity to only two independent conservation relations. One governs the global redistribution of uncertainty and recovers Shannon entropy. The other captures a complementary local geometric component, formalised as Fisher information. Together, these conserved quantities motivate a non-additive state function, the information potential $\u03a6$, which isolates structural degrees of freedom beyond entropy while remaining invariant under reparametrisation. $\u03a6$ quantifies local sharpness and ruggedness in posterior beliefs and vanishes uniquely for isotropic Gaussian distributions. In a low-temperature regime, $\u03a6$ scales logarithmically with the effective number of local optima, linking information geometry to computational complexity. This formalises an information-computation exchange, whereby information acquisition reshapes the inference landscape and reduces computational demands. By separating invariant informational constraints from inference mechanisms, this framework provides a unified, algorithm-independent foundation for inference, learning, and computation across biological and artificial systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u529b\u5b66\uff08infomechanics\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u7406\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u51cf\u5c11\u7684\u5b88\u6052\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5c06\u9999\u519c\u71b5\u548c\u8d39\u5e0c\u5c14\u4fe1\u606f\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u5b88\u6052\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u52bf\u03a6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cf\u5316\u540e\u9a8c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u5e38\u88ab\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u51cf\u5c11\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u7ea6\u675f\u673a\u5236\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e00\u6027\u539f\u7406\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u7b97\u6cd5\u3001\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u548c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u5206\u79bb\u4fe1\u606f\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u70b9\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u786e\u7acb\u540e\u9a8c\u60ca\u5947\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0e\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u5f97\u4fe1\u606f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u65bd\u52a0\u53ef\u52a0\u6027\u3001\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u5b88\u6052\u5173\u7cfb\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u63a7\u5236\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5168\u5c40\u91cd\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u9999\u519c\u71b5\uff0c\u4e8c\u662f\u6355\u83b7\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8d39\u5e0c\u5c14\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5b9a\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u52bf\u03a6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u975e\u53ef\u52a0\u72b6\u6001\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u6846\u67b6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u5b88\u6052\u91cf\uff1a\u9999\u519c\u71b5\uff08\u5168\u5c40\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff09\u548c\u8d39\u5e0c\u5c14\u4fe1\u606f\uff08\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\uff09\u3002\u4fe1\u606f\u52bf\u03a6\u91cf\u5316\u540e\u9a8c\u4fe1\u5ff5\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u5c16\u9510\u6027\u548c\u5d0e\u5c96\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u9879\u540c\u6027\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u65f6\u552f\u4e00\u4e3a\u96f6\u3002\u5728\u4f4e\u6e29\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\uff0c\u03a6\u4e0e\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6570\u91cf\u5448\u5bf9\u6570\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u5c06\u4fe1\u606f\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4fe1\u606f\u529b\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f-\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ea4\u6362\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u4fe1\u606f\u83b7\u53d6\u91cd\u65b0\u5851\u9020\u63a8\u7406\u666f\u89c2\u5e76\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u3001\u7b97\u6cd5\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u4e86\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

This can lower memory use and improve runtime feasibility on constrained hardware, which is especially relevant for users running models locally. Quantization in llama.cpp enables large language models to run on commodity hardware, but available formats are often evaluated inconsistently, making it hard to choose among schemes. We present a unified empirical study of the llama.cpp quantization on a single modern model, Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct (FP16, GGUF), covering 3-8 bit K-quant and legacy formats. We evaluate downstream task performance across standard reasoning, knowledge, instruction-following, and truthfulness benchmarks, and also measure perplexity and CPU throughput (prefill/decoding) alongside model size, compression, and quantization time. Ultimately, this work is a practical guide for choosing a llama.cpp quantization scheme, helping readers make informed, context-aware decisions for their intended use and resource budget.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Computed Tomography (CT) images are processed to enhance the contrast, reduce the noise followed by smoothing. The processed CT images are segmented using thresholding technique. 2D contour data points are extracted from segmented CT images and are used to construct 3D STL Models. The 2D contour data points may contain outliers as a result of segmentation of low resolution images and the geometry of the constructed 3D structure deviate from the actual. To cope with the imperfections in segmentation process, in this work we propose to use filtered 2D contour data points to reconstruct 3D STL Model. The filtered 2D contour points of each image are delaunay triangulated and joined layer-by-layer to reconstruct the 3D STL model. The 3D STL Model reconstruction is verified on i) 2D Data points of basic shapes and ii) Region of Interest (ROI) of human pelvic bone and are presented as case studies. The 3D STL model constructed from 2D contour data points of ROI of segmented pelvic bone with and without filtering are presented.

Existing benchmarks primarily emphasize indoor or street settings, overlooking the unique challenges of open-ended urban spaces characterized by rich semantics, complex geometries, and view variations. To address this, we introduce CityCube, a systematic benchmark designed to probe cross-view reasoning capabilities of current VLMs in urban settings. CityCube integrates four viewpoint dynamics to mimic camera movements and spans a wide spectrum of perspectives from multiple platforms, e.g., vehicles, drones and satellites. For a comprehensive assessment, it features 5,022 meticulously annotated multi-view QA pairs categorized into five cognitive dimensions and three spatial relation expressions.

This is achieved by introducing fast, multi-gigawatt load ramps that challenge the stability and resilience of modern power systems. Traditional resilience frameworks focus mainly on physical outages and largely overlook these emerging digital-era disturbances. This paper proposes a unified two-stage, risk-aware distributionally robust optimization (DRO)-MILP framework that coordinates the pre-allocation and post-event dispatch of Flexible Capacity Modules (FCMs), including BESS, fast-ramping generation, demand response, and potential long-duration storage. Stage-I optimally positions FCMs using DRO with CVaR to hedge against uncertain AI load surges. Stage-II models real-time stabilization following stochastic demand-shock scenarios, minimizing imbalance, unserved energy, and restoration penalties. The framework is designed to be applied on IEEE 33-bus system or expanded for scalability to larger IEEE test feeders capable of representing AI-scale loads.

Genetic programming has been widely applied as a hyper-heuristic to evolve priority rules that guide the selection of activity-mode pairs from the current eligible set. Recently, an activity group selection strategy has been proposed to select a subset of activities rather than a single activity at each decision point, allowing for more effective scheduling by considering the interdependence between activities. Although effective in small-scale instances, this strategy suffers from scalability issues when applied to larger problems. In this work, we enhance the scalability of the group selection strategy by introducing a knee-point-based selection mechanism to identify a promising subset of activities before evaluating their combinations. An activity ordering rule is first used to rank all eligible activity-mode pairs, followed by a knee point selection to find the promising pairs. Then, a group selection rule selects the best activity combination. We develop a multi-tree GP framework to evolve both types of rules simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach scales well to large instances and outperforms GP with sequential decision-making in most scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

As a result, machine learning based surrogate modelling has emerged as a promising approach, but integrating machine learning models such as ReLU deep neural networks (DNNs) directly into optimisation often results in nonconvex and computationally intractable formulations. This paper proposes a linear programming (LP) reformulation for a class of convexified ReLU DNNs with non-negative weight matrices beyond the first layer, enabling a tight and tractable embedding of learned surrogate models in optimisation. We evaluate the method using a case study on learning the prosumer's responsiveness within an aggregator bidding problem in the Danish tertiary capacity market. The proposed reformulation is benchmarked against state-of-the-art alternatives, including piecewise linearisation (PWL), MIP-based embedding, and other LP relaxations. Across multiple neural network architectures and market scenarios, the convexified ReLU DNN achieves solution quality comparable to PWL and MIP-based reformulations while significantly improving computational performance and preserving model fidelity, unlike penalty-based reformulations. The results demonstrate that convexified ReLU DNNs offer a scalable and reliable methodology for integrating learned surrogate models in optimisation, with applicability to a wide range of emerging power system applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Here, we present a \"Just-in-Time\" framework for simulation-based reasoning that demonstrates how such representations can be constructed online with minimal added computation. The model uses a tight interleaving of simulation, visual search, and representation modification, with the current simulation guiding where to look and visual search flagging objects that should be encoded for subsequent simulation. Despite only ever encoding a small subset of objects, the model makes high-utility predictions.

Specifically, the proposed algorithm transforms the time-frequency (TF) domain pilot sequence of OFDM into the DD domain and applies a two-dimensional (2D) twisted-convolution for acquiring a coarse estimation of the underlying channel delay and Doppler. Then, the OFDM channel estimation is formulated as a sparse signal recovery problem in the TF domain according to the dictionary derived based on the obtained delay and Doppler estimates. Furthermore, a low-complexity $\\ell_1$-regularized least-square estimator is proposed to effectively solve this problem. Moreover, we further develop a performance analysis framework of the proposed scheme based on the ambiguity function (AF) of the adopted pilot sequence. Our numerical results demonstrate noticeable estimation performance improvement compared to conventional OFDM channel estimation methods, particularly in the presence of high channel mobility.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While existing works have typically focused on comparing models within a single algorithmic category, cross-algorithm comparisons remain scarce. In this paper, to fill the gap, we establish a benchmark to evaluate the performance of fifteen models across these different algorithmic foundations by assessing the pharmaceutical properties of the generated molecules and their docking affinities and poses with specified target proteins. We highlight the unique advantages of each algorithmic approach and offer recommendations for the design of future SBDD models. We emphasize that 1D/2D ligand-centric drug design methods can be used in SBDD by treating the docking function as a black-box oracle, which is typically neglected. Our evaluation reveals distinct patterns across model categories. 3D structure-based models excel in binding affinities but show inconsistencies in chemical validity and pose quality. 1D models demonstrate reliable performance in standard molecular metrics but rarely achieve optimal binding affinities. 2D models offer balanced performance, maintaining high chemical validity while achieving moderate binding scores. Through detailed analysis across multiple protein targets, we identify key improvement areas for each model category, providing insights for researchers to combine strengths of different approaches while addressing their limitations.

Recent work has explored large language model (LLM)-assisted evolutionary methods for automated code optimization, but these approaches primarily rely on outcome-based selection and random mutation, underutilizing the rich trajectory information generated during iterative optimization. We propose PhyloEvolve, an LLM-agent system that reframes GPU-oriented algorithm optimization as an In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) problem. This formulation enables trajectory-conditioned reuse of optimization experience without model retraining. PhyloEvolve integrates Algorithm Distillation and prompt-based Decision Transformers into an iterative workflow, treating sequences of algorithm modifications and performance feedback as first-class learning signals. To organize optimization history, we introduce a phylogenetic tree representation that captures inheritance, divergence, and recombination among algorithm variants, enabling backtracking, cross-lineage transfer, and reproducibility.

We propose MAS-Orchestra, a training-time framework that formulates MAS orchestration as a function-calling reinforcement learning problem with holistic orchestration, generating an entire MAS at once. In MAS-Orchestra, complex, goal-oriented sub-agents are abstracted as callable functions, enabling global reasoning over system structure while hiding internal execution details. To rigorously study when and why MAS are beneficial, we introduce MASBENCH, a controlled benchmark that characterizes tasks along five axes: Depth, Horizon, Breadth, Parallel, and Robustness. Our analysis reveals that MAS gains depend critically on task structure, verification protocols, and the capabilities of both orchestrator and sub-agents, rather than holding universally. Guided by these insights, MAS-Orchestra achieves consistent improvements on public benchmarks including mathematical reasoning, multi-hop QA, and search-based QA.

However, our empirical analysis reveals two fundamental limitations: complex construction incurs high costs with marginal performance gains, and simple context concatenation fails to bridge the gap between retrieval recall and reasoning accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose CoM (Chain-of-Memory), a novel framework that advocates for a paradigm shift toward lightweight construction paired with sophisticated utilization.

By utilizing Field-Space Attention, the model efficiently operates on native climate model output and therefore avoids geometric distortions caused by forcing spherical data onto Euclidean grids. This approach preserves physical structures significantly better than convolutional baselines. By producing a structured compressed field, it serves as a good baseline for downstream generative emulation. In addition, the model can perform zero-shot super-resolution that maps low-resolution large ensembles and scarce high-resolution data into a shared representation. We train a generative diffusion model on these compressed fields.

We consider differential privacy mechanisms for linear queries when the input data are constrained to lie on affine manifolds, a structural property that is assumed to be available as prior knowledge to adversaries. In this setting, the definition of neighborhood adjacency must be formulated with respect to the intrinsic geometry of the manifolds. We demonstrate that such affine-manifold constraints can fundamentally alter the attainable privacy levels relative to the unconstrained case. In particular, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which differential privacy can be realized via structured noise injection mechanisms, wherein correlated Gaussian or Laplace noise distributions, rather than i.i.d. perturbations, are calibrated to the dataset. Based on these characterizations, we develop explicit noise calibration procedures that guarantee the tight realization of any prescribed privacy budget with a matching noise magnitude. Finally, we show that the proposed framework admits direct applications to linear dynamical systems ranging from differentially private cloud-based control to privacy-preserving average consensus, all of which naturally involve affine-manifold constraints.

A central challenge in this regime is whether meaningful gradient information can be recovered from such discrete responses. In this work, we develop a unified theoretical perspective showing that a wide range of existing sign-flipping hard-label attacks can be interpreted as implicitly approximating the sign of the true loss gradient. This observation reframes hard-label attacks from heuristic search procedures into instances of gradient sign recovery under extremely limited feedback. Motivated by this first-principles understanding, we propose a new attack framework that combines a zero-query frequency-domain initialization with a Pattern-Driven Optimization (PDO) strategy. We establish theoretical guarantees demonstrating that, under mild assumptions, our initialization achieves higher expected cosine similarity to the true gradient sign compared to random baselines, while the proposed PDO procedure attains substantially lower query complexity than existing structured search approaches. We empirically validate our framework through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and ObjectNet, covering standard and adversarially trained models, commercial APIs, and CLIP-based models. The results show that our method consistently surpasses SOTA hard-label attacks in both attack success rate and query efficiency, particularly in low-query regimes. Beyond image classification, our approach generalizes effectively to corrupted data, biomedical datasets, and dense prediction tasks.

This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the field, synthesizing fragmented literature into a unified logic-conditioned hybrid control framework. Within this formalism, we categorize approaches into two distinct paradigms: Reactive Safety, which responds to realized hazards by enforcing safety constraints or executing fail-safe maneuvers; and Proactive Safety, which optimizes for future recourse by branching over potential modal transitions. In addition, we propose a fine-grained taxonomy that partitions the landscape into external contingencies (environmental and interactive hazards) and internal contingencies (system faults). Through a critical comparative analysis, we reveal a fundamental structural divergence: internal faults are predominantly addressed via reactive fail-safe mechanisms, whereas external interaction uncertainties increasingly require proactive branching strategies. Furthermore, we identify a critical methodological divergence: whereas physical hazards are typically managed with formal guarantees, semantic and out-of-distribution anomalies currently rely heavily on empirical validation. We conclude by identifying the open challenges in bridging the gap between theoretical guarantees and practical validation, advocating for hybrid architectures and standardized benchmarking to transition contingency planning from formulation to certifiable real-world deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u7684\u5e94\u6025\u89c4\u5212\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\uff0c\u603b\u7ed3\u4e86\u5e94\u5bf9\u79bb\u6563\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5371\u5bb3\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u6761\u4ef6\u6df7\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u9700\u8981\u6709\u80fd\u529b\u5e94\u5bf9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6545\u969c\u3001\u5bf9\u6297\u4ea4\u4e92\u7b49\u79bb\u6563\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u5371\u5bb3\uff0c\u4f46\u76f8\u5173\u6587\u732e\u8f83\u4e3a\u5206\u6563\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6574\u5408\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u5e94\u6025\u89c4\u5212\u5206\u7c7b\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u903b\u8f91\u6761\u4ef6\u6df7\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5e94\u6025\u89c4\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u54cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u4e3b\u52a8\u5f0f\u5b89\u5168\u4e24\u5927\u8303\u5f0f\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u4e3a\u5916\u90e8\u610f\u5916\uff08\u73af\u5883\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u5371\u5bb3\uff09\u548c\u5185\u90e8\u610f\u5916\uff08\u7cfb\u7edf\u6545\u969c\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff1a\u5185\u90e8\u6545\u969c\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u54cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u800c\u5916\u90e8\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u9700\u8981\u4e3b\u52a8\u5206\u652f\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u5dee\u5f02\uff1a\u7269\u7406\u98ce\u9669\u53ef\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u5f02\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5021\u5bfc\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u5e94\u6025\u89c4\u5212\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u5230\u5b9e\u9645\u53ef\u8ba4\u8bc1\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

ICAI'25: 27th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence https://american-cse.org/csce2025/conferences-ICAI", "summary": "Qualitative research often contains personal, contextual, and organizational details that pose privacy risks if not handled appropriately. Manual anonymization is time-consuming, inconsistent, and frequently omits critical identifiers. Existing automated tools tend to rely on pattern matching or fixed rules, which fail to capture context and may alter the meaning of the data. This study uses local LLMs to build a reliable, repeatable, and context-aware anonymization process for detecting and anonymizing sensitive data in qualitative transcripts. We introduce a Structured Framework for Adaptive Anonymizer (SFAA) that includes three steps: detection, classification, and adaptive anonymization. The SFAA incorporates four anonymization strategies: rule-based substitution, context-aware rewriting, generalization, and suppression. These strategies are applied based on the identifier type and the risk level. The identifiers handled by the SFAA are guided by major international privacy and research ethics standards, including the GDPR, HIPAA, and OECD guidelines. This study followed a dual-method evaluation that combined manual and LLM-assisted processing. Two case studies were used to support the evaluation. The first includes 82 face-to-face interviews on gamification in organizations. The second involves 93 machine-led interviews using an AI-powered interviewer to test LLM awareness and workplace privacy. Two local models, LLaMA and Phi were used to evaluate the performance of the proposed framework. The results indicate that the LLMs found more sensitive data than a human reviewer. Phi outperformed LLaMA in finding sensitive data, but made slightly more errors. Phi was able to find over 91% of the sensitive data and 94.8% kept the same sentiment as the original text, which means it was very accurate, hence, it does not affect the analysis of the qualitative data.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address such attacks, we formulate the observer design as a max-min optimization problem to enhance the detectability of worst-case BIAs, which attain a prescribed attack impact with the least detectability evaluated via Kullback-Leibler divergence. To reduce the computational complexity of the derived non-convex design problem, we consider the detectability of worst-case BIAs at three specific time instants: attack onset, one step after attack occurrence, and the steady state. We prove that the Kalman filter is optimal for maximizing the BIA detectability at the attack onset, regardless of the subset of attacked sensors. For the one-step and steady-state cases, the observer design problems are approximated by bi-convex optimization problems, which can be efficiently solved using alternating optimization and alternating direction method of multipliers. Moreover, more tractable linear matrix inequality relaxations are developed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed stealth-aware detection framework is demonstrated through an application to a thermal system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u968f\u673a\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9488\u5bf9\u9690\u853d\u504f\u7f6e\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7cfb\u7edf\u9762\u4e34\u9690\u853d\u6027\u504f\u7f6e\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u653b\u51fb\u8005\u5229\u7528\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u5f0f\u7f13\u6162\u534f\u8c03\u5730\u6ce8\u5165\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u504f\u7f6e\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9690\u853d\u6027\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6076\u610f\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u68c0\u6d4b\u6b64\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u6700\u5927\u6700\u5c0f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6700\u574f\u60c5\u51b5\u504f\u7f6e\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\uff1b\u8003\u8651\u653b\u51fb\u5f00\u59cb\u3001\u653b\u51fb\u53d1\u751f\u540e\u4e00\u6b65\u548c\u7a33\u6001\u4e09\u4e2a\u7279\u5b9a\u65f6\u523b\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u523b\u5206\u522b\u91c7\u7528\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u53cc\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7ebf\u6027\u77e9\u9635\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u677e\u5f1b\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u6c42\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u5361\u5c14\u66fc\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u5728\u653b\u51fb\u5f00\u59cb\u65f6\u5bf9\u6700\u5927\u5316\u653b\u51fb\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\uff1b\u9488\u5bf9\u653b\u51fb\u53d1\u751f\u540e\u4e00\u6b65\u548c\u7a33\u6001\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u4ea4\u66ff\u65b9\u5411\u4e58\u5b50\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u8fd1\u4f3c\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9690\u853d\u611f\u77e5\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u70ed\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u9690\u853d\u611f\u77e5\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u968f\u673a\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u853d\u504f\u7f6e\u6ce8\u5165\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u65f6\u523b\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Although large language models (LLMs) offer rich semantic understanding for free-form recommendation, applying them to long-horizon LPR is challenging due to (i) misalignment with pedagogical objectives such as the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) under sparse, delayed feedback, (ii) scarce and costly expert demonstrations, and (iii) multi-objective interactions among learning effect, difficulty scheduling, length controllability, and trajectory diversity. To address these issues, we propose IB-GRPO (Indicator-Based Group Relative Policy Optimization), an indicator-guided alignment approach for LLM-based LPR. To mitigate data scarcity, we construct hybrid expert demonstrations via Genetic Algorithm search and teacher RL agents and warm-start the LLM with supervised fine-tuning. Building on this warm-start, we design a within-session ZPD alignment score for difficulty scheduling.

To address these challenges, we propose a Hierarchical Contextual Uplift Bandit framework. Our framework dynamically adjusts contextual granularity from broad, system-wide insights to detailed, user-specific contexts, using contextual similarity to facilitate effective policy transfer and mitigate cold-start issues. Additionally, we integrate uplift modeling principles into our approach. Results from large-scale A/B testing on the Dream11 fantasy sports platform show that our method significantly enhances recommendation quality, achieving a 0.4% revenue improvement while also improving user satisfaction metrics compared to the current production system.

However, existing methods generally treat the frequency domain as a whole, neglecting the differences in the information carried by its internal components. According to Fourier transform theory, phase and amplitude represent different types of information in the image. Our spectrum swapping experiments show that magnitude mainly reflects pixel-level intensity, while phase predominantly governs image structure. To prevent interference between phase and magnitude feature learning caused by unified frequency-domain modeling, we propose the Phase-Amplitude-Spatial State Space Model (PAS-Mamba) for MRI Reconstruction, a framework that decouples phase and magnitude modeling in the frequency domain and combines it with image-domain features for better reconstruction. In the image domain, LocalMamba preserves spatial locality to sharpen fine anatomical details. In frequency domain, we disentangle amplitude and phase into two specialized branches to avoid representational coupling. To respect the concentric geometry of frequency information, we propose Circular Frequency Domain Scanning (CFDS) to serialize features from low to high frequencies. Finally, a Dual-Domain Complementary Fusion Module (DDCFM) adaptively fuses amplitude phase representations and enables bidirectional exchange between frequency and image domains, delivering superior reconstruction. Extensive experiments on the IXI and fastMRI knee datasets show that PAS-Mamba consistently outperforms state of the art reconstruction methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PAS-Mamba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u9891\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u4f4d\u4e0e\u5e45\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u57df\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684MRI\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684MRI\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9891\u57df\u65f6\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u5176\u89c6\u4e3a\u6574\u4f53\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u76f8\u4f4d\u548c\u5e45\u5ea6\u6240\u643a\u5e26\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u4fe1\u606f\u7c7b\u578b\uff08\u76f8\u4f4d\u4e3b\u5bfc\u56fe\u50cf\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e45\u5ea6\u53cd\u6620\u50cf\u7d20\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u9891\u57df\u5efa\u6a21\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "method": "1. \u5728\u7a7a\u57df\u4f7f\u7528LocalMamba\u4fdd\u6301\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c40\u90e8\u6027\u4ee5\u9510\u5316\u7ec6\u8282\uff1b2. \u5728\u9891\u57df\u5c06\u76f8\u4f4d\u548c\u5e45\u5ea6\u89e3\u8026\u5230\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e13\u7528\u5206\u652f\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51fa\u73af\u5f62\u9891\u57df\u626b\u63cf\uff08CFDS\uff09\u6309\u9891\u7387\u4ece\u4f4e\u5230\u9ad8\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u7279\u5f81\uff1b4. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u53cc\u57df\u4e92\u8865\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff08DDCFM\uff09\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u878d\u5408\u632f\u5e45\u76f8\u4f4d\u8868\u5f81\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u9891\u57df\u4e0e\u7a7a\u57df\u7684\u53cc\u5411\u4ea4\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u5728IXI\u548cfastMRI\u819d\u5173\u8282\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPAS-Mamba\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u9891\u57df\u76f8\u4f4d\u548c\u5e45\u5ea6\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u53cc\u57df\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0cPAS-Mamba\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528MRI\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9891\u57df\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

The results show a feasible off-grid design as an alternative to conventional electrification solutions. To address the challenges of design and operation of such a system, a power system model of the equipment and control was developed in a power system simulator called Process Power Simulator (PPSim). Power fluctuations in the wind farm are modelled using a state-of-the-art method encompassing turbulence and wakes. Various operation scenarios were used to evaluate the system design and find the right equipment size. An expensive component to over dimension is the battery energy storage system (BESS). The BESS power rating and energy capacity were found by running a combination of scenarios with extreme and natural wind variations, and contingencies. The control strategy and ramp rates of electrolyzers have significant impact on both system performance and design. A ramp rate in the order of seconds as opposed to minutes will decrease the required BESS size by 60-70%. Choosing synchronized control of the electrolyzers can further reduce the BESS size by 15-20%.

However, the inherent sparsity of these annotations introduces significant ambiguity, which results in noisy pseudo-label propagation and hinders the learning of robust anatomical boundaries. To address this challenge, we propose SDT-Net, a novel dual-teacher, single-student framework designed to maximize supervision quality from these weak signals. Our method features a Dynamic Teacher Switching (DTS) module to adaptively select the most reliable teacher. This selected teacher then guides the student via two synergistic mechanisms: high-confidence pseudo-labels, refined by a Pick Reliable Pixels (PRP) mechanism, and multi-level feature alignment, enforced by a Hierarchical Consistency (HiCo) module.

Recent vision-language models (VLMs) demonstrate reasoning and generalization abilities, opening new possibilities for autonomous driving; however, existing benchmarks and metrics overemphasize perceptual competence and fail to adequately assess decision-making processes. In this work, we present AutoDriDM, a decision-centric, progressive benchmark with 6,650 questions across three dimensions - Object, Scene, and Decision. We evaluate mainstream VLMs to delineate the perception-to-decision capability boundary in autonomous driving, and our correlation analysis reveals weak alignment between perception and decision-making performance. We further conduct explainability analyses of models' reasoning processes, identifying key failure modes such as logical reasoning errors, and introduce an analyzer model to automate large-scale annotation. AutoDriDM bridges the gap between perception-centered and decision-centered evaluation, providing guidance toward safer and more reliable VLMs for real-world autonomous driving.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The system in consideration follows primary energy technologies in Thailand including solar power, battery storage, and a diverse portfolio of renewable and carbon-based energy procurement sources. Unlike existing literature focused on long-term planning, this study addresses near real-time operations using a 15-minute resolution. A novel feature of the formulation is the explicit treatment of CFE compliance as a model parameter, enabling flexible targets such as a minimum percentage of hourly matching or a required number of carbon-free days within a multi-day horizon. The mixed-integer linear programming formulation accounts for uncertainties in load and solar generation by integrating deep learning-based forecasting within a receding horizon framework. By optimizing battery profiles and multi-source procurement simultaneously, the proposed system provides a feasible pathway for transitioning to carbon-free operations in emerging energy markets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u73b024/7\u96f6\u78b3\u80fd\u6e90(CFE)\u5408\u89c4\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6210\u672c\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u6cf0\u56fd\u80fd\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4ee515\u5206\u949f\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u8fdb\u884c\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fd0\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u7075\u6d3b\u8bbe\u7f6eCFE\u5408\u89c4\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u768424/7\u96f6\u78b3\u80fd\u6e90\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u96c6\u4e2d\u4e8e\u957f\u671f\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fd0\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5728\u6cf0\u56fd\u7b49\u65b0\u5174\u80fd\u6e90\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u5411\u96f6\u78b3\u8fd0\u8425\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u8fc7\u6e21\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u7535\u6c60\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u591a\u6e90\u91c7\u8d2d\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u6574\u6570\u7ebf\u6027\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u752815\u5206\u949f\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002\u5c06CFE\u5408\u89c4\u8981\u6c42\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u5408\u89c4\u76ee\u6807\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8d1f\u8377\u548c\u592a\u9633\u80fd\u53d1\u7535\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6eda\u52a8\u65f6\u57df\u6846\u67b6\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u7535\u6c60\u8fd0\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u591a\u5143\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u4e0e\u78b3\u57fa\u80fd\u6e90\u91c7\u8d2d\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u65b0\u5174\u5e02\u573a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5411\u96f6\u78b3\u8fd0\u8425\u8fc7\u6e21\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316CFE\u5408\u89c4\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u968f\u673a\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b324/7\u96f6\u78b3\u80fd\u6e90\u5408\u89c4\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u8fd0\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u573a\u666f\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5904\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5728\u65b0\u5174\u80fd\u6e90\u5e02\u573a\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Advertisers often have personalized objectives but limited historical interaction data, resulting in few-shot scenarios where traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle to perform effectively. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative for AIGB by leveraging their in-context learning capabilities to generalize from limited data. However, they lack the numerical precision required for fine-grained optimization. To address this limitation, we introduce GRPO-Adaptive, an efficient LLM post-training strategy that enhances both reasoning and numerical precision by dynamically updating the reference policy during training. Built upon this foundation, we further propose DARA, a novel dual-phase framework that decomposes the decision-making process into two stages: a few-shot reasoner that generates initial plans via in-context prompting, and a fine-grained optimizer that refines these plans using feedback-driven reasoning. This separation allows DARA to combine LLMs' in-context learning strengths with precise adaptability required by AIGB tasks.

In this work, we introduce \\emph{Variational JEPA (VJEPA)}, a \\textit{probabilistic} generalization that learns a predictive distribution over future latent states via a variational objective. We show that VJEPA unifies representation learning with Predictive State Representations (PSRs) and Bayesian filtering, establishing that sequential modeling does not require autoregressive observation likelihoods. Theoretically, we prove that VJEPA representations can serve as sufficient information states for optimal control without pixel reconstruction, while providing formal guarantees for collapse avoidance. We further propose \\emph{Bayesian JEPA (BJEPA)}, an extension that factorizes the predictive belief into a learned dynamics expert and a modular prior expert, enabling zero-shot task transfer and constraint (e.g. goal, physics) satisfaction via a Product of Experts. Empirically, through a noisy environment experiment, we demonstrate that VJEPA and BJEPA successfully filter out high-variance nuisance distractors that cause representation collapse in generative baselines.

Existing state-of-the-art approaches, such as Brain Latent Progression (BrLP), often use multi-stage training pipelines with auxiliary conditioning modules but suffer from architectural complexity, suboptimal use of conditional clinical covariates, and limited guarantees of anatomical consistency. We propose Anatomically Guided Latent Diffusion Model (AG-LDM), a segmentation-guided framework that enforces anatomically consistent progression while substantially simplifying the training pipeline. AG-LDM conditions latent diffusion by directly fusing baseline anatomy, noisy follow-up states, and clinical covariates at the input level, a strategy that avoids auxiliary control networks by learning a unified, end-to-end model that represents both anatomy and progression. A lightweight 3D tissue segmentation model (WarpSeg) provides explicit anatomical supervision during both autoencoder fine-tuning and diffusion model training, ensuring consistent brain tissue boundaries and morphometric fidelity. Experiments on 31,713 ADNI longitudinal pairs and zero-shot evaluation on OASIS-3 demonstrate that AG-LDM matches or surpasses more complex diffusion models, achieving state-of-the-art image quality and 15-20\\% reduction in volumetric errors in generated images. AG-LDM also exhibits markedly stronger utilization of temporal and clinical covariates (up to 31.5x higher sensitivity than BrLP) and generates biologically plausible counterfactual trajectories, accurately capturing hallmarks of Alzheimer's progression such as limbic atrophy and ventricular expansion.

Most existing unsupervised summarization methods rely on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to enhance keyframe selection and generate coherent, video summaries through adversarial training. However, such approaches primarily exploit unimodal features, overlooking the guiding role of semantic information in keyframe selection, and often suffer from unstable training. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Semantic-Guided Unsupervised Video Summarization method.

Since encoding all frames is prohibitively expensive, uniform sampling is the default choice, but it enforces equal temporal coverage while ignoring the uneven events distribution. This motivates a Learnable Frame Selector (LFS) that selects temporally diverse and event-relevant frames. LFS explicitly models temporal importance to balance temporal diversity and event relevance, and employs a stratified strategy to ensure temporal coverage while avoiding clustering. Crucially, LFS leverages caption feedback from frozen video-LLMs to learn frame selection that directly optimizes downstream caption quality. Additionally, we identify the gap between existing benchmark and human's cognition. Thus, we introduce ICH-CC built from carefully designed questions by annotators that reflect human-consistent understanding of video. Experiments indicate that LFS consistently improves detailed video captioning across two representative community benchmarks and ICH-CC, achieving up to 2.0% gains on VDC and over 4% gains on ICH-CC.

Therefore, several polynomial-time tightening techniques, such as edge finding, not-first-not-last reasoning, and energetic reasoning, have been introduced for this constraint. In this work, we derive the first bound-consistent algorithm for the no-overlap constraint. By building on the no-overlap MDD defined by Cir\u00e9 and van Hoeve, we extract bounds of the time window of the jobs, allowing us to tighten start and end times in time polynomial in the number of nodes of the MDD. Similarly, to bound the size and time-complexity, we limit the width of the MDD to a threshold, creating a relaxed MDD that can also be used to relax the bound-consistent filtering. Through experiments on a sequencing problem with time windows and a just-in-time objective ($1 \\mid r_j, d_j, \\bar{d}_j \\mid \\sum E_j + \\sum T_j$), we observe that the proposed filtering, even with a threshold on the width, achieves a stronger reduction in the number of nodes visited in the search tree compared to the previously proposed precedence-detection algorithm of Cir\u00e9 and van Hoeve.

We introduce MSR-HINE, a hierarchical implicit forecaster that augments multiscale latent priors with multi-rate recurrent modules operating at distinct temporal scales. At each step, coarse-to-fine recurrent states generate latent priors, an implicit one-step predictor refines the state with multiscale latent injections, and a gated fusion with posterior latents enforces scale-consistent updates; a lightweight hidden-state correction further aligns recurrent memories with fused latents. The resulting architecture maintains long-term context on slow manifolds while preserving fast-scale variability, mitigating error accumulation in chaotic rollouts. Across two canonical benchmarks, MSR-HINE yields substantial gains over a U-Net autoregressive baseline: on Kuramoto-Sivashinsky it reduces end-horizon RMSE by 62.8% at H=400 and improves end-horizon ACC by +0.983 (from -0.155 to 0.828), extending the ACC >= 0.5 predictability horizon from 241 to 400 steps; on Lorenz-96 it reduces RMSE by 27.0% at H=100 and improves end horizon ACC by +0.402 (from 0.144 to 0.545), extending the ACC >= 0.5 horizon from 58 to 100 steps.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Yet, visual language models (VLMs) lack an analogous mechanism for spatial reasoning, limiting their ability to generate images that accurately reflect geometric relations, object identities, and compositional intent. We introduce the concept of a spatial scratchpad -- a 3D reasoning substrate that bridges linguistic intent and image synthesis. Given a text prompt, our framework parses subjects and background elements, instantiates them as editable 3D meshes, and employs agentic scene planning for placement, orientation, and viewpoint selection. The resulting 3D arrangement is rendered back into the image domain with identity-preserving cues, enabling the VLM to generate spatially consistent and visually coherent outputs. Unlike prior 2D layout-based methods, our approach supports intuitive 3D edits that propagate reliably into final images. Empirically, it achieves a 32% improvement in text alignment on GenAI-Bench, demonstrating the benefit of explicit 3D reasoning for precise, controllable image generation.

Modern workflows increasingly rely on learning-based components to support model reuse, inference, and integration across large computational processes. Despite the emergence of various physics-aware data-driven approaches, the field still lacks a unified perspective to uncover their relationships, limitations, and appropriate roles in scientific workflows. To this end, we propose a unifying perspective to place two dominant paradigms: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Neural Operators (NOs), within a shared design space. We organize existing methods from three fundamental dimensions: what is learned, how physical structures are integrated into the learning process, and how the computational load is amortized across problem instances. In this way, many challenges can be best understood as consequences of these structural properties of learning PDEs. By analyzing advances through this unifying view, our survey aims to facilitate the development of reliable learning-based PDE solvers and catalyze a synthesis of physics and data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5206\u6790PINNs\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u4e3b\u6d41\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ece\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u63ed\u793a\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u548c\u9002\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5f53\u89d2\u8272\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u5b66\u4e60\u578bPDE\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4ece\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7ec4\u7ec7\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u8c61\uff08what\uff09\u3001\u7269\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u5f0f\uff08how\uff09\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u644a\u9500\u673a\u5236\uff08amortization\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e86PINNs\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u7b97\u5b50\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u4e0e\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5c06\u5404\u79cd\u6311\u6218\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u578bPDE\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u79d1\u5b66\u7684\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4e3a\u9886\u57df\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

By integrating U-Harmony, our approach sequentially normalizes and then denormalizes feature distributions to mitigate domain-specific variations while preserving original dataset-specific knowledge.

Linking Adversarial and Statistical Robustness", "comment": null, "summary": "Adversarial attacks are widely used to evaluate model robustness, yet their validity as proxies for robustness to random perturbations remains debated. We ask whether an adversarial perturbation provides a representative estimate of robustness under random noise of the same magnitude, or instead reflects an atypical worst-case event. To this end, we introduce a probabilistic metric that quantifies noisy risk with respect to directionally biased perturbation distributions, parameterized by a concentration factor $\u03ba$ that interpolates between isotropic noise and adversarial direction. Using this framework, we study the limits of adversarial perturbations as estimators of noisy risk by proposing an attack strategy designed to operate in regimes statistically closer to uniform noise. Experiments on ImageNet and CIFAR-10 systematically benchmark widely used attacks, highlighting when adversarial success meaningfully reflects noisy risk and when it fails, thereby informing their use in safety-oriented evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This leads to common errors where VLMs misclassify coarser taxonomic levels even when correctly identifying the most specific level (leaf level). Existing approaches largely overlook this issue by failing to model hierarchical reasoning. To address this gap, we propose VL-Taxon, a two-stage, hierarchy-based reasoning framework designed to improve both leaf-level accuracy and hierarchical consistency in taxonomic classification. The first stage employs a top-down process to enhance leaf-level classification accuracy. The second stage then leverages this accurate leaf-level output to ensure consistency throughout the entire taxonomic hierarchy. Each stage is initially trained with supervised fine-tuning to instill taxonomy knowledge, followed by reinforcement learning to refine the model's reasoning and generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments reveal a remarkable result: our VL-Taxon framework, implemented on the Qwen2.5-VL-7B model, outperforms its original 72B counterpart by over 10% in both leaf-level and hierarchical consistency accuracy on average on the iNaturalist-2021 dataset.

We formalize runway cascade as a phenomenon whereby this misalignment results in redundancies and irrelevant information cascading to token representations despite adequately learned attention patterns. As a solution, we propose runway-aware rewiring as a more explicit way of incorporating runway context directly into each token's direct-path attention. This mechanism re-wires the attention pattern for each token based on a summary of its runway landscape, enabling awareness of accumulating representational influences and allowing for more balanced information propagation.

Previous research demonstrates that incorporating diffusion-based measurements, such as reconstruction error, can enhance the generalizability of detectors. However, ignoring the differing impacts of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty on reconstruction error can undermine detection performance. Aleatoric uncertainty, arising from inherent data noise, creates ambiguity that impedes accurate detection of generated images. As it reflects random variations within the data (e.g., noise in natural textures), it does not help distinguish generated images. In contrast, epistemic uncertainty, which represents the model's lack of knowledge about unfamiliar patterns, supports detection. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty with Asymmetric Learning~(DEUA), for detecting diffusion-generated images. We introduce Diffusion Epistemic Uncertainty~(DEU) estimation via the Laplace approximation to assess the proximity of data to the manifold of diffusion-generated samples.

Recent work has explored updating the proposal model at test time [arXiv:2511.23473], but the update strategy is still typically hand-specified. Therefore, this study investigated whether an LLM can use task feedback to decide how it should update its weights. For tractability, we focused on the simpler case where there is only one round of self-improvement, and restricted the update operator to self-supervised next token prediction (NTP), leaving the model freedom in choosing its training data and key NTP hyperparameters. Using the Self-Adapting Language Models (SEAL) [arXiv:2506.10943] framework as a testbed, we relaxed its fixed human template constraint and allowed the model to generate its own self-edit templates, thereby giving it more control over its training data and hyperparameters. Two variants were studied, differing in whether template generation was conditioned on a lightweight archive of past templates. In SEAL's Single-Passage Knowledge Incorporation setting with Qwen3-8B on SQuAD [arXiv:1606.05250], the no-archive variant performed comparably to the weaker \"Implications\" baseline, while the archive variant outperformed \"Implications\" and approached the strongest human-designed \"Rewrite\" baseline without surpassing it. Further analysis of collapse in the model's exploration revealed that a naive archive can confer some short-term robustness but can also accelerate homogenization, suggesting that explicit novelty pressure may be required to consistently advance beyond carefully optimized human strategies.

We introduce a practical method for evaluating awareness across diverse systems, where awareness is understood as encompassing a system's abilities to process, store and use information in the service of goal-directed action. Central to this approach is the claim that any evaluation aiming to capture the diversity of artificial systems must be domain-sensitive, deployable at any scale, multidimensional, and enable the prediction of task performance, while generalising to the level of abilities for the sake of comparison. Given these four desiderata, we outline a structured approach to evaluating and comparing awareness profiles across artificial systems with differing architectures, scales, and operational domains.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a promising way to integrate prior knowledge by encoding feature relationships as graphs. Yet, existing methods typically rely solely on either an externally curated feature graph or a data-driven generated one, which limits their ability to capture complementary information. To address this, we propose the external and generated Graph Neural Network (engGNN), a dual-graph framework that jointly leverages both external known biological networks and data-driven generated graphs. Specifically, engGNN constructs a biologically informed undirected feature graph from established network databases and complements it with a directed feature graph derived from tree-ensemble models. This dual-graph design produces more comprehensive embeddings, thereby improving predictive performance and interpretability. Through extensive simulations and real-world applications to gene expression data, engGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Although recent audio-visual approaches have improved automatic depression detection, methods that ignore emotional cues often fail to capture subtle depressive signals hidden within emotional expressions. Conversely, those incorporating emotions frequently confuse transient emotional expressions with stable depressive symptoms in feature representations, a phenomenon termed \\emph{Emotional Ambiguity}, thereby leading to detection errors. To address this critical issue, we propose READ-Net, the first audio-visual depression detection framework explicitly designed to resolve Emotional Ambiguity through Adaptive Feature Recalibration (AFR). The core insight of AFR is to dynamically adjust the weights of emotional features to enhance depression-related signals. Rather than merely overlooking or naively combining emotional information, READ-Net innovatively identifies and preserves depressive-relevant cues within emotional features, while adaptively filtering out irrelevant emotional noise.

The transitions between these behaviors offer valuable insights into user-item interactions, serving as a key signal for un- derstanding evolving preferences. Consequently, there is growing interest in leveraging multi-behavior data to better capture user intent. Recent studies have explored sequential modeling of multi- behavior data, many relying on transformer-based architectures with polynomial time complexity. While effective, these approaches often incur high computational costs, limiting their applicability in large-scale industrial systems with long user sequences. To address this challenge, we propose the Transition-Aware Graph Attention Network (TGA), a linear-complexity approach for modeling multi-behavior transitions. Unlike traditional trans- formers that treat all behavior pairs equally, TGA constructs a structured sparse graph by identifying informative transitions from three perspectives: (a) item-level transitions, (b) category-level transitions, and (c) neighbor-level transitions. Built upon the structured graph, TGA employs a transition-aware graph Attention mechanism that jointly models user-item interactions and behav- ior transition types, enabling more accurate capture of sequential patterns while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show that TGA outperforms all state-of-the-art models while sig- nificantly reducing computational cost. Notably, TGA has been deployed in a large-scale industrial production environment, where it leads to impressive improvements in key business metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faTGA\uff08Transition-Aware Graph Attention Network\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u7535\u5546\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u9020\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u6355\u83b7\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u8f6c\u79fb\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ebf\u6027\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u8350\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5de5\u4e1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u95f4\u7684\u8f6c\u79fb\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u70b9\u51fb\u5230\u8d2d\u4e70\uff09\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u53cd\u6620\u504f\u597d\u6f14\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "TGA\u4ece\u4e09\u4e2a\u5c42\u9762\u8bc6\u522b\u4fe1\u606f\u8f6c\u79fb\u6784\u5efa\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\uff1a(a)\u5546\u54c1\u7ea7\u8f6c\u79fb(b)\u54c1\u7c7b\u7ea7\u8f6c\u79fb(c)\u90bb\u5c45\u7ea7\u8f6c\u79fb\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u8f6c\u79fb\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u7528\u6237-\u5546\u54c1\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u8f6c\u79fb\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eTGA\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u90e8\u7f72\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u4e1a\u52a1\u6307\u6807\u3002", "conclusion": "TGA\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a00\u758f\u56fe\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u884c\u4e3a\u8f6c\u79fb\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5de5\u4e1a\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This strict causality supervision optimizes each step only by its immediate next token, which diminishes global coherence and slows convergence. We ask whether foresight, training signals that originate from later tokens, can help AR visual generation. We conduct a series of controlled diagnostics along the injection level, foresight layout, and foresight source axes, unveiling a key insight: aligning foresight to AR models' internal representation on the 2D image grids improves causality modeling. We formulate this insight with Mirai (meaning \"future\" in Japanese), a general framework that injects future information into AR training with no architecture change and no extra inference overhead: Mirai-E uses explicit foresight from multiple future positions of unidirectional representations, whereas Mirai-I leverages implicit foresight from matched bidirectional representations. Extensive experiments show that Mirai significantly accelerates convergence and improves generation quality. For instance, Mirai can speed up LlamaGen-B's convergence by up to 10$\\times$ and reduce the generation FID from 5.34 to 4.34 on the ImageNet class-condition image generation benchmark.

This position is affected by unexamined onto-epistemological assumptions: meaning is treated as immanent to the model, the explainer is positioned outside the system, and a causal structure is presumed recoverable through computational techniques. In this paper, we draw on Barad's agential realism to develop an alternative onto-epistemology of XAI. We propose that interpretations are material-discursive performances that emerge from situated entanglements of the AI model with humans, context, and the interpretative apparatus. To develop this position, we read a comprehensive set of XAI methods through agential realism and reveal the assumptions and limitations that underpin several of these methods.

Quantization reduces model size and cost but suffers from device noise in emerging non-volatile memories, while conventional memory hierarchies further limit efficiency. SRAM provides fast access but has low density, DRAM must simultaneously accommodate static weights and dynamic KV caches, which creates bandwidth contention, and Flash, although dense, is primarily used for initialization and remains inactive during inference. These limitations highlight the need for hybrid memory organizations tailored to LLM inference. We propose Outlier-aware Quantization with Memory Co-design (QMC), a retraining-free quantization with a novel heterogeneous memory architecture. QMC identifies inlier and outlier weights in SLMs, storing inlier weights in compact multi-level Resistive-RAM (ReRAM) while preserving critical outliers in high-precision on-chip Magnetoresistive-RAM (MRAM), mitigating noise-induced degradation. On language modeling and reasoning benchmarks, QMC outperforms and matches state-of-the-art quantization methods using advanced algorithms and hybrid data formats, while achieving greater compression under both algorithm-only evaluation and realistic deployment settings. Specifically, compared against SoTA quantization methods on the latest edge AI platform, QMC reduces memory usage by 6.3x-7.3x, external data transfers by 7.6x, energy by 11.7x, and latency by 12.5x when compared to FP16, establishing QMC as a scalable, deployment-ready co-design for efficient on-device inference.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing methods face two distinct challenges. Geometrically unconditioned models lack spatial awareness, leading to drift and deformation under viewpoint changes. On the other hand, geometrically-conditioned models depend on estimated depth and explicit reconstruction, making them susceptible to depth inaccuracies and calibration errors.\n  We propose to address these challenges by using the implicit geometric knowledge embedded in the latent space of a large 4D reconstruction model to condition the video generation process. These latents capture scene structure in a continuous space without explicit reconstruction.

One major application of ATT&CK is the use of its tactic and technique hierarchy by security specialists as a framework for annotating cyber-threat intelligence reports, vulnerability descriptions, threat scenarios, inter alia, to facilitate downstream analyses. To date, the tagging process is still largely done manually. In this technical note, we provide a stratified \"task space\" characterization of the MITRE ATT&CK text tagging task for organizing previous efforts toward automation using AIML methods, while also clarifying pathways for constructing new methods. To illustrate one of the pathways, we use the task space strata to stage-wise construct our own multi-label hierarchical classification models for the text tagging task via experimentation over general cyber-threat intelligence text -- using shareable computational tools and publicly releasing the models to the security community (via https://github.com/jpmorganchase/MITRE_models). Our multi-label hierarchical approach yields accuracy scores of roughly 94% at the tactic level, as well as accuracy scores of roughly 82% at the technique level. The models also meet or surpass state-of-the-art performance while relying only on classical machine learning methods -- removing any dependence on LLMs, RAG, agents, or more complex hierarchical approaches. Moreover, we show that GPT-4o model performance at the tactic level is significantly lower (roughly 60% accuracy) than our own approach. We also extend our baseline model to a corpus of threat scenarios for financial applications produced by subject matter experts.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

As these systems become more autonomous and are deployed at scale, understanding why an agent takes a particular action becomes increasingly important for accountability and governance.

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework for \\textbf{general agentic attribution}, designed to identify the internal factors driving agent actions regardless of the task outcome. Our framework operates hierarchically to manage the complexity of agent interactions. Specifically, at the \\textit{component level}, we employ temporal likelihood dynamics to identify critical interaction steps; then at the \\textit{sentence level}, we refine this localization using perturbation-based analysis to isolate the specific textual evidence. We validate our framework across a diverse suite of agentic scenarios, including standard tool use and subtle reliability risks like memory-induced bias. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework reliably pinpoints pivotal historical events and sentences behind the agent behavior, offering a critical step toward safer and more accountable agentic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing approaches often rely on multi-source external data (such as weather, traffic, and social media) to improve accuracy, which can lead to unreliable results when historical data are insufficient. To address these challenges, we propose a Transformer-based framework that leverages reservation dynamics, i.e., ticket bookings and subsequent updates within a time window, as a proxy for visitors' attendance intentions, under the assumption that such intentions are eventually reflected in reservation patterns. This design avoids the complexity of multi-source integration while still capturing external influences like weather and promotions implicitly embedded in reservation dynamics. We construct a dataset combining entrance records and reservation dynamics and evaluate the model under both single-channel (total attendance) and two-channel (separated by East and West gates) settings. Results show that separately modeling East and West gates consistently improves accuracy, particularly for short- and medium-term horizons. Ablation studies further confirm the importance of the encoder-decoder structure, inverse-style embedding, and adaptive fusion module. Overall, our findings indicate that reservation dynamics offer a practical and informative foundation for attendance forecasting in large-scale international events.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In cancer histopathology, for example, a convolutional neural network (CNN) may classify cancer severity accurately for cancer types represented in its training data, yet fail on related but unseen types. Although adenocarcinomas from different organs share morphological features that might support limited cross-domain generalization, addressing domain shift directly is necessary for robust performance. Domain adaptation offers a way to transfer knowledge from labeled data in one cancer type to unlabeled data in another, helping mitigate the scarcity of annotated medical images.\n  This work evaluates cross-domain classification performance among lung, colon, breast, and kidney adenocarcinomas. A ResNet50 trained on any single adenocarcinoma achieves over 98% accuracy on its own domain but shows minimal generalization to others. Ensembling multiple supervised models does not resolve this limitation. In contrast, converting the ResNet50 into a domain adversarial neural network (DANN) substantially improves performance on unlabeled target domains. A DANN trained on labeled breast and colon data and adapted to unlabeled lung data reaches 95.56% accuracy.\n  We also examine the impact of stain normalization on domain adaptation. Its effects vary by target domain: for lung, accuracy drops from 95.56% to 66.60%, while for breast and colon targets, stain normalization boosts accuracy from 49.22% to 81.29% and from 78.48% to 83.36%, respectively. Finally, using Integrated Gradients reveals that DANNs consistently attribute importance to biologically meaningful regions such as densely packed nuclei, indicating that the model learns clinically relevant features and can apply them to unlabeled cancer types.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing post-training methods generally leverage either real system samples or virtual data simulated by LLMs. However, the former is costly due to reliance on hand-crafted user requests, while the latter suffers from distribution shift from the real tools in the wild. Additionally, both methods lack negative samples tailored to intent deviation scenarios, hindering effective guidance on preference learning.

Therefore, CFs can be used as (i) interventions for abnormality prevention and (ii) augmented data for training robust models. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of CF generation using large language models (LLMs), including GPT-4 (zero-shot and few-shot) and two open-source models-BioMistral-7B and LLaMA-3.1-8B, in both pretrained and fine-tuned configurations. Using the multimodal AI-READI clinical dataset, we assess CFs across three dimensions: intervention quality, feature diversity, and augmentation effectiveness.

Overall, this work demonstrates the promise of LLM-driven counterfactuals for both interpretable intervention design and data-efficient model training in sensor-based digital health.\n  Impact: SenseCF fine-tunes an LLM to generate valid, representative counterfactual explanations and supplement minority class in an imbalanced dataset for improving model training and boosting model robustness and predictive performance", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc4\u4f30\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5728AI-READI\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u5e72\u9884\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660eLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u52a8\u53d8\u5316\u6539\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u5f02\u5e38\u9884\u9632\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528GPT-4\uff08\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\uff09\u53ca\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff08BioMistral-7B\u548cLLaMA-3.1-8B\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u751f\u6210\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e72\u9884\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u7279\u5f81\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u6548\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u7684LLM\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662fLLaMA-3.1-8B\uff09\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff08\u8fbe99%\uff09\u3001\u5f3a\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff08\u8fbe0.99\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4ea7\u751f\u53ef\u884c\u4e3a\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8c03\u6574\uff1b\u5728\u6807\u7b7e\u7a00\u7f3a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u6062\u590d\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e73\u5747F1\u6062\u590d20%\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5e72\u9884\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u5177\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6027\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

This article defines the \"Plausibility Trap\": a phenomenon where individuals with access to Artificial Intelligence (AI) models deploy expensive probabilistic engines for simple deterministic tasks-such as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) or basic verification-resulting in significant resource waste. Through micro-benchmarks and case studies on OCR and fact-checking, we quantify the \"efficiency tax\"-demonstrating a ~6.5x latency penalty-and the risks of algorithmic sycophancy. To counter this, we introduce Tool Selection Engineering and the Deterministic-Probabilistic Decision Matrix, a framework to help developers determine when to use Generative AI and, crucially, when to avoid it. We argue for a curriculum shift, emphasizing that true digital literacy relies not only in knowing how to use Generative AI, but also on knowing when not to use it.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper aims to shed light on them, and it faces the challenge of several entangled confounding factors in the fine-tuning process. To tackle this challenge, we propose a bottom-up experiment pipeline. The bottom layer is composed of a minimalist configuration: one training data, one rollout per round and the reward directly serve as the learning signal without advantage function design. This minimalist configuration connects to multi-armed bandit learning with extremely large discrete action space, which offers theories to corroborate the experiment findings.

Such a process is time-consuming and heavily relies on the accuracy of registration algorithm. Moreover, not all hospitals have paired CBCT data, limitting the construction of multi-center dataset. Inspired by the way dentists determine the implant position based on the neighboring tooth texture, we found that even if the implant area is masked, it will not affect the determination of the implant position. Therefore, we propose to mask the implants in the post-implantation data so that any CBCT containing the implants can be used as training data. This paradigm enables us to discard the registration process and makes it possible to construct a large-scale multi-center implant dataset. On this basis, we proposes ImplantFairy, a comprehensive, publicly accessible dental implant dataset with voxel-level 3D annotations of 1622 CBCT data. Furthermore, according to the area variation characteristics of the tooth's spatial structure and the slope information of the implant, we designed a slope-aware implant position prediction network. Specifically, a neighboring distance perception (NDP) module is designed to adaptively extract tooth area variation features, and an implant slope prediction branch assists the network in learning more robust features through additional implant supervision information. Extensive experiments conducted on ImplantFairy and two public dataset demonstrate that the proposed RegFreeNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Muon-NSR applies noise-to-signal ratio (NSR) modulation, while Muon-VS performs variance-based scaling without introducing additional hyperparameters.

Existing methods mainly enhance inter-class distinctions and employ data augmentation to mitigate semantic ambiguity and reduce spurious activations. However, they often neglect the complex contextual dependencies among image patches, resulting in incomplete local representations and limited segmentation accuracy. To address these issues, we propose the Context Patch Fusion with Class Token Enhancement (CPF-CTE) framework, which exploits contextual relations among patches to enrich feature representations and improve segmentation. At its core, the Contextual-Fusion Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (CF-BiLSTM) module captures spatial dependencies between patches and enables bidirectional information flow, yielding a more comprehensive understanding of spatial correlations. This strengthens feature learning and segmentation robustness. Moreover, we introduce learnable class tokens that dynamically encode and refine class-specific semantics, enhancing discriminative capability. By effectively integrating spatial and semantic cues, CPF-CTE produces richer and more accurate representations of image content.

We propose a bottom-up learning paradigm in which models are grounded in axiomatic domain facts and compose them to solve complex, unseen tasks. To this end, we present a post-training pipeline, based on a combination of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning (RL), in which knowledge graphs act as implicit reward models. By deriving novel reward signals from knowledge graph paths, we provide verifiable, scalable, and grounded supervision that encourages models to compose intermediate axioms rather than optimize only final answers during RL. We validate this approach in the medical domain, training a 14B model on short-hop reasoning paths (1-3 hops) and evaluating its zero-shot generalization to complex multi-hop queries (4-5 hops). Our experiments show that path-derived rewards act as a \"compositional bridge\", enabling our model to significantly outperform much larger models and frontier systems like GPT-5.2 and Gemini 3 Pro, on the most difficult reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robustness of our approach to adversarial perturbations against option-shuffling stress tests.

We identify a critical pathology in current training paradigms where goal-driven data collection creates a dataset bias. In such datasets, language instructions are highly predictable from visual observations alone, causing the conditional mutual information between instructions and actions to vanish, a phenomenon we term Information Collapse. Consequently, models degenerate into vision-only policies that ignore language constraints and fail in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. To address this, we propose BayesianVLA, a novel framework that enforces instruction following via Bayesian decomposition. By introducing learnable Latent Action Queries, we construct a dual-branch architecture to estimate both a vision-only prior $p(a \\mid v)$ and a language-conditioned posterior $\u03c0(a \\mid v, \\ell)$. We then optimize the policy to maximize the conditional Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) between actions and instructions. This objective effectively penalizes the vision shortcut and rewards actions that explicitly explain the language command.

Most molecular language models rely on strings or graphs, while vision-language models often miss stereochemical details and struggle to map continuous 3D structures into discrete tokens. We propose DeepMoLM: Deep Molecular Language M odeling, a dual-view framework that grounds high-resolution molecular images in geometric invariants derived from molecular conformations. DeepMoLM preserves high-frequency evidence from 1024 $\\times$ 1024 inputs, encodes conformer neighborhoods as discrete Extended 3-Dimensional Fingerprints, and fuses visual and geometric streams with cross-attention, enabling physically grounded generation without atom coordinates. DeepMoLM improves PubChem captioning with a 12.3% relative METEOR gain over the strongest generalist baseline while staying competitive with specialist methods. It produces valid numeric outputs for all property queries and attains MAE 13.64 g/mol on Molecular Weight and 37.89 on Complexity in the specialist setting. On ChEBI-20 description generation from images, it exceeds generalist baselines and matches state-of- the-art vision-language models.

Most existing search-based symbolic regression methods typically rely on the fitting error to inform the search process. However, in the vast expression space, numerous candidate expressions may exhibit similar error values while differing substantially in structure, leading to ambiguous search directions and hindering convergence to the underlying true function. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework named EGRL-SR (Experience-driven Goal-conditioned Reinforcement Learning for Symbolic Regression). In contrast to traditional error-driven approaches, EGRL-SR introduces a new perspective: leveraging precise historical trajectories and optimizing the action-value network to proactively guide the search process, thereby achieving a more robust expression search. Specifically, we formulate symbolic regression as a goal-conditioned reinforcement learning problem and incorporate hindsight experience replay, allowing the action-value network to generalize common mapping patterns from diverse input-output pairs. Moreover, we design an all-point satisfaction binary reward function that encourages the action-value network to focus on structural patterns rather than low-error expressions, and concurrently propose a structure-guided heuristic exploration strategy to enhance search diversity and space coverage. Experiments on public benchmarks show that EGRL-SR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in recovery rate and robustness, and can recover more complex expressions under the same search budget. Ablation results validate that the action-value network effectively guides the search, with both the reward function and the exploration strategy playing critical roles.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing proactive defenses, often adapted from image editing attacks, prove ineffective in this context. We attribute this failure to an oversight of the structural resilience and the unique static conditional guidance mechanism inherent in face swapping systems. To address this, we propose VoidFace, a systemic defense method that views face swapping as a coupled identity pathway. By injecting perturbations at critical bottlenecks, VoidFace induces cascading disruption throughout the pipeline. Specifically, we first introduce localization disruption and identity erasure to degrade physical regression and semantic embeddings, thereby impairing the accurate modeling of the source face. We then intervene in the generative domain by decoupling attention mechanisms to sever identity injection, and corrupting intermediate diffusion features to prevent the reconstruction of source identity. To ensure visual imperceptibility, we perform adversarial search in the latent manifold, guided by a perceptual adaptive strategy to balance attack potency with image quality. Extensive experiments show that VoidFace outperforms existing defenses across various diffusion-based swapping models, while producing adversarial faces with superior visual quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing GU methods lack a clear understanding of the key factors that determine unlearning effectiveness, leading to three fundamental limitations: (1) impractical and inaccurate GU difficulty assessment due to test-access requirements and invalid assumptions, (2) ineffectiveness on hard-to-unlearn tasks, and (3) misaligned evaluation protocols that overemphasize easy tasks and fail to capture true forgetting capability. To address these issues, we establish GNN memorization as a new perspective for understanding graph unlearning and propose MGU, a Memorization-guided Graph Unlearning framework. MGU achieves three key advances: it provides accurate and practical difficulty assessment across different GU tasks, develops an adaptive strategy that dynamically adjusts unlearning objectives based on difficulty levels, and establishes a comprehensive evaluation protocol that aligns with practical requirements. Extensive experiments on ten real-world graphs demonstrate that MGU consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in forgetting quality, computational efficiency, and utility preservation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although resource-constrained edge computing adequately supports fast low-resolution T2I generations, achieving high-resolution output still faces the challenge of ensuring image fidelity at the cost of latency. To address this, we first investigate the performance of super-resolution (SR) methods for image enhancement, confirming a fundamental trade-off that lightweight learning-based SR struggles to recover fine details, while diffusion-based SR achieves higher fidelity at a substantial computational cost. Motivated by these observations, we propose an end-edge collaborative generation-enhancement framework. Upon receiving a T2I generation task, the system first generates a low-resolution image based on adaptively selected denoising steps and super-resolution scales at the edge side, which is then partitioned into patches and processed by a region-aware hybrid SR policy. This policy applies a diffusion-based SR model to foreground patches for detail recovery and a lightweight learning-based SR model to background patches for efficient upscaling, ultimately stitching the enhanced ones into the high-resolution image.

To address these challenges, this paper introduces SimD3, a large-scale high-fidelity synthetic dataset designed for robust drone detection in complex aerial environments. Unlike existing synthetic drone datasets, SimD3 explicitly models drones with heterogeneous payloads, incorporates multiple bird species as realistic distractors, and leverages diverse Unreal Engine 5 environments with controlled weather, lighting, and flight trajectories captured using a 360 six-camera rig. Using SimD3, we conduct an extensive experimental evaluation within the YOLOv5 detection framework, including an attention-enhanced variant termed Yolov5m+C3b, where standard bottleneck-based C3 blocks are replaced with C3b modules. Models are evaluated on synthetic data, combined synthetic and real data, and multiple unseen real-world benchmarks to assess robustness and generalization. Experimental results show that SimD3 provides effective supervision for small-object drone detection and that Yolov5m+C3b consistently outperforms the baseline across in-domain and cross-dataset evaluations. These findings highlight the utility of SimD3 for training and benchmarking robust drone detection models under diverse and challenging conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "SimD3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0d\u8db3\u3001\u5916\u89c2\u53d8\u5316\u5927\u53ca\u9e1f\u7c7b\u5e72\u6270\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5728YOLOv5\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u68c0\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u3001\u5916\u89c2\u5dee\u5f02\u5927\u3001\u5b58\u5728\u9e1f\u7c7b\u7b49\u89c6\u89c9\u5e72\u6270\u7269\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u521b\u5efaSimD3\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5f02\u8d28\u8f7d\u8377\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u3001\u591a\u79cd\u9e1f\u7c7b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e72\u6270\u7269\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Unreal Engine 5\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u91c7\u7528360\u516d\u76f8\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u96c6\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u5728YOLOv5\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5f00\u53d1Yolov5m+C3b\u53d8\u4f53\uff08\u7528C3b\u6a21\u5757\u66ff\u6362C3\u6a21\u5757\uff09", "result": "SimD3\u5bf9\u5c0f\u578b\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u76d1\u7763\uff0cYolov5m+C3b\u5728\u57df\u5185\u548c\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b", "conclusion": "SimD3\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u590d\u6742\u6311\u6218\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b"}}

A primary obstacle for standard reinforcement learning (RL) is the absence of an explicit environment simulator or transition data $(s, a, s')$; planning must rely solely on a static database of historical outcomes. We introduce the Implicit Bayesian Markov Decision Process (IBMDP), a model-based RL framework designed for such simulator-free settings. IBMDP constructs a case-guided implicit model of transition dynamics by forming a nonparametric belief distribution using similar historical outcomes. This mechanism enables Bayesian belief updating as evidence accumulates and employs ensemble MCTS planning to generate stable policies that balance information gain toward desired outcomes with resource efficiency. We validate IBMDP through comprehensive experiments. On a real-world central nervous system (CNS) drug discovery task, IBMDP reduced resource consumption by up to 92\\% compared to established heuristics while maintaining decision confidence. To rigorously assess decision quality, we also benchmarked IBMDP in a synthetic environment with a computable optimal policy.

This paper formulates this problem as a multi-instance learning (MIL) task, where a query polyp image is compared with a target bag of images to determine uniqueness. We employ a multi-instance verification (MIV) framework that incorporates attention mechanisms, such as variance-excited multi-head attention (VEMA) and distance-based attention (DBA), to enhance the model's ability to extract meaningful representations. Additionally, we investigate the impact of self-supervised learning using SimCLR to generate robust embeddings. Experimental results on a dataset of 1912 polyps from 754 patients demonstrate that attention mechanisms significantly improve performance, with DBA L1 achieving the highest test accuracy of 86.26\\% and a test AUC of 0.928 using a ConvNeXt backbone with SimCLR pretraining.

Existing explainability methods face a trade-off that gradient-based approaches are computationally efficient but often ignore structural interactions, while game-theoretic techniques capture interactions at the cost of high computational overhead and potential deviation from the model's true reasoning path. To address this gap, we propose FSX (Message Flow Sensitivity Enhanced Structural Explainer), a novel hybrid framework that synergistically combines the internal message flows of the model with a cooperative game approach applied to the external graph data. FSX first identifies critical message flows via a novel flow-sensitivity analysis: during a single forward pass, it simulates localized node perturbations and measures the resulting changes in message flow intensities. These sensitivity-ranked flows are then projected onto the input graph to define compact, semantically meaningful subgraphs. Within each subgraph, a flow-aware cooperative game is conducted, where node contributions are evaluated fairly through a Shapley-like value that incorporates both node-feature importance and their roles in sustaining or destabilizing the identified critical flows. Extensive evaluation across multiple datasets and GNN architectures demonstrates that FSX achieves superior explanation fidelity with significantly reduced runtime, while providing unprecedented insights into the structural logic underlying model predictions--specifically, how important sub-structures exert influence by governing the stability of key internal computational pathways.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While medical VLMs are expected to capture diagnostically relevant features, their learned representations remain underexplored, and standard evaluations like classification accuracy do not fully reveal if they acquire truly discriminative, lesion-specific features. Understanding these representations is crucial for revealing medical image structures and improving downstream tasks in medical image analysis. This study aims to investigate the feature distributions learned by medical VLMs and evaluate the impact of medical specialization. We analyze the feature distribution of multiple image modalities extracted by some representative medical VLMs across lesion classification datasets on multiple modalities. These distributions were compared them with non-medical VLMs to assess the domain-specific medical training. Our experiments showed that medical VLMs can extract discriminative features that are effective for medical classification tasks. Moreover, it was found that non-medical VLMs with recent improvement with contextual enrichment such as LLM2CLIP produce more refined feature representations. Our results imply that enhancing text encoder is more crucial than training intensively on medical images when developing medical VLMs. Notably, non-medical models are particularly vulnerable to biases introduced by overlaied text strings on images. These findings underscore the need for careful consideration on model selection according to downstream tasks besides potential risks in inference due to background biases such as textual information in images.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, the internal algorithmic transformations induced by this paradigm shift remain unexplored, leaving it unclear whether post-trained MDMs acquire genuine bidirectional reasoning capabilities or merely repackage autoregressive heuristics. In this work, we address this question by conducting a comparative circuit analysis of ARMs and their MDM counterparts. Our analysis reveals a systematic \"mechanism shift\" dependent on the structural nature of the task. Structurally, we observe a distinct divergence: while MDMs largely retain autoregressive circuitry for tasks dominated by local causal dependencies, they abandon initialized pathways for global planning tasks, exhibiting distinct rewiring characterized by increased early-layer processing. Semantically, we identify a transition from sharp, localized specialization in ARMs to distributed integration in MDMs. Through these findings, we conclude that diffusion post-training does not merely adapt model parameters but fundamentally reorganizes internal computation to support non-sequential global planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing methods face two major limitations: (1) high-quality multimodal dubbing datasets are limited in scale, suffer from high word error rates, contain sparse annotations, rely on costly manual labeling, and are restricted to monologue scenes, all of which hinder effective model training; (2) existing dubbing models rely solely on the lip region to learn audio-visual alignment, which limits their applicability to complex live-action cinematic scenes, and exhibit suboptimal performance in lip sync, speech quality, and emotional expressiveness. To address these issues, we propose FunCineForge, which comprises an end-to-end production pipeline for large-scale dubbing datasets and an MLLM-based dubbing model designed for diverse cinematic scenes. Using the pipeline, we construct the first Chinese television dubbing dataset with rich annotations, and demonstrate the high quality of these data. Experiments across monologue, narration, dialogue, and multi-speaker scenes show that our dubbing model consistently outperforms SOTA methods in audio quality, lip sync, timbre transfer, and instruction following.

Extending these methods to continuous features remains substantially more challenging due to the large number of potential splits for each feature. Recently, an elegant exact algorithm was proposed for learning optimal decision trees with continuous features; however, the rapidly increasing computational time limits its practical applicability to shallow depths (typically 3 or 4). It relies on a depth-first search optimization strategy that fully optimizes the left subtree of each split before exploring the corresponding right subtree. While effective in finding optimal solutions given sufficient time, this strategy can lead to poor anytime behavior: when interrupted early, the best-found tree is often highly unbalanced and suboptimal. In such cases, purely greedy methods such as C4.5 may, paradoxically, yield better solutions. To address this limitation, we propose an anytime, yet complete approach leveraging limited discrepancy search, distributing the computational effort more evenly across the entire tree structure, and thus ensuring that a high-quality decision tree is available at any interruption point. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the existing one in terms of anytime performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, current motion diffusion models face two major limitations: a representational gap caused by pre-trained text encoders that lack motion-specific information, and error propagation during the iterative denoising process. This paper introduces Reconstruction-Anchored Diffusion Model (RAM) to address these challenges. First, RAM leverages a motion latent space as intermediate supervision for text-to-motion generation. To this end, RAM co-trains a motion reconstruction branch with two key objective functions: self-regularization to enhance the discrimination of the motion space and motion-centric latent alignment to enable accurate mapping from text to the motion latent space. Second, we propose Reconstructive Error Guidance (REG), a testing-stage guidance mechanism that exploits the diffusion model's inherent self-correction ability to mitigate error propagation. At each denoising step, REG uses the motion reconstruction branch to reconstruct the previous estimate, reproducing the prior error patterns. By amplifying the residual between the current prediction and the reconstructed estimate, REG highlights the improvements in the current prediction.

Results demonstrate task-specific benefits: type classification showed the most substantial improvement (5.5\\% F1-macro increase with 90:10 ratio), while dynasty and kiln tasks exhibited modest gains (3-4\\%), suggesting that synthetic augmentation effectiveness depends on the alignment between generated features and task-relevant visual signatures.

This paper introduces a reflection-in-reflection framework for automated generation of reflection questions with large language models (LLMs). Our approach coordinates two role-specialized agents, a Student-Teacher and a Teacher-Educator, that engage in a Socratic multi-turn dialogue to iteratively refine a single question given a teacher-specified topic, key concepts, student level, and optional instructional materials. The Student-Teacher proposes candidate questions with brief rationales, while the Teacher-Educator evaluates them along clarity, depth, relevance, engagement, and conceptual interconnections, responding only with targeted coaching questions or a fixed signal to stop the dialogue. We evaluate the framework in an authentic lower-secondary ICT setting on the topic, using GPT-4o-mini as the backbone model and a stronger GPT- 4-class LLM as an external evaluator in pairwise comparisons of clarity, relevance, depth, and overall quality. First, we study how interaction design and context (dynamic vs.fixed iteration counts; presence or absence of student level and materials) affect question quality. Dynamic stopping combined with contextual information consistently outperforms fixed 5- or 10-step refinement, with very long dialogues prone to drift or over-complication. Second, we show that our two-agent protocol produces questions that are judged substantially more relevant and deeper, and better overall, than a one-shot baseline using the same backbone model.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Historically, various handcrafted geometry-aware descriptors and feature refinement techniques have been proposed. Recently, several studies have initiated a new research direction by leveraging features from image foundation models to create semantics-aware descriptors, demonstrating advantages across tasks like shape matching, editing, and segmentation. Symmetry, another key concept in shape analysis, has also attracted increasing attention. Consequently, constructing symmetry-aware shape descriptors is a natural progression. Although the recent method $\u03c7$ (Wang et al., 2025) successfully extracted symmetry-informative features from semantic-aware descriptors, its features are only one-dimensional, neglecting other valuable semantic information. Furthermore, the extracted symmetry-informative feature is usually noisy and yields small misclassified patches. To address these gaps, we propose a feature disentanglement approach which is simultaneously symmetry informative and symmetry agnostic. Further, we propose a feature refinement technique to improve the robustness of predicted symmetry informative features.

First, POTR introduces a novel pruning approach that uses a modified 3DGS rasterizer to efficiently calculate every splat's individual removal effect simultaneously. This technique results in 2-4x fewer splats than other post-training pruning techniques and as a result also significantly accelerates inference with experiments demonstrating 1.5-2x faster inference than other compressed models. Second, we propose a novel method to recompute lighting coefficients, significantly reducing their entropy without using any form of training. Our fast and highly parallel approach especially increases AC lighting coefficient sparsity, with experiments demonstrating increases from 70% to 97%, with minimal loss in quality.

A Systematic Study", "comment": null, "summary": "Reasoning models excel at complex tasks such as coding and mathematics, yet their inference is often slow and token-inefficient. To improve the inference efficiency, post-training quantization (PTQ) usually comes with the cost of large accuracy drops, especially for reasoning tasks under low-bit settings. In this study, we present a systematic empirical study of quantization-aware training (QAT) for reasoning models. Our key findings include: (1) Knowledge distillation is a robust objective for reasoning models trained via either supervised fine-tuning or reinforcement learning; (2) PTQ provides a strong initialization for QAT, improving accuracy while reducing training cost; (3) Reinforcement learning remains feasible for quantized models given a viable cold start and yields additional gains; and (4) Aligning the PTQ calibration domain with the QAT training domain accelerates convergence and often improves the final accuracy. Finally, we consolidate these findings into an optimized workflow (Reasoning-QAT), and show that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PTQ methods across multiple LLM backbones and reasoning datasets. For instance, on Qwen3-0.6B, it surpasses GPTQ by 44.53% on MATH-500 and consistently recovers performance in the 2-bit regime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6(Reasoning-QAT)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u3001PTQ\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709PTQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u5982\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u901a\u5e38\u8f83\u6162\u4e14token\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\uff08PTQ\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08QAT\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51faReasoning-QAT\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9c81\u68d2\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff1b\u4ee5PTQ\u4f5c\u4e3aQAT\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff1b\u63a2\u7d22\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff1b\u5c06PTQ\u6821\u51c6\u57df\u4e0eQAT\u8bad\u7ec3\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ee5\u52a0\u901f\u6536\u655b\u3002", "result": "Reasoning-QAT\u5728\u591a\u6b3eLLM\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684PTQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4f8b\u5982\u5728Qwen3-0.6B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cMATH-500\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8aGPTQ\u8fbe44.53%\uff0c\u57282\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86QAT\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u91cf\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Reasoning-QAT\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e3a\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

While deep learning models on dermoscopic images have shown promise, they require specialized equipment, limiting their use in broader clinical settings. This study introduces a multi-modal melanoma detection system using conventional photo images, making it more accessible and versatile. Our system integrates image data with tabular metadata, such as patient demographics and lesion characteristics, to improve detection accuracy. It employs a multi-modal neural network combining image and metadata processing and supports a two-step model for cases with or without metadata. A three-stage pipeline further refines predictions by boosting algorithms and enhancing performance. To address the challenges of a highly imbalanced dataset, specific techniques were implemented to ensure robust training. An ablation study evaluated recent vision architectures, boosting algorithms, and loss functions, achieving a peak Partial ROC AUC of 0.18068 (0.2 maximum) and top-15 retrieval sensitivity of 0.78371.

To assess the impact of patient-specific data, we conduct experiments comparing a multimodal, patient-specific approach against traditional CGM-only methods. Additionally, we perform an ablation study to investigate model performance with progressively smaller training sets, identifying the minimum data required for effective personalization-an essential consideration for real-world applications where extensive data collection is often challenging.

Letaief"], "title": "Communication-Efficient Multi-Modal Edge Inference via Uncertainty-Aware Distributed Learning", "comment": null, "summary": "Semantic communication is emerging as a key enabler for distributed edge intelligence due to its capability to convey task-relevant meaning. However, achieving communication-efficient training and robust inference over wireless links remains challenging. This challenge is further exacerbated for multi-modal edge inference (MMEI) by two factors: 1) prohibitive communication overhead for distributed learning over bandwidth-limited wireless links, due to the \\emph{multi-modal} nature of the system; and 2) limited robustness under varying channels and noisy multi-modal inputs. In this paper, we propose a three-stage communication-aware distributed learning framework to improve training and inference efficiency while maintaining robustness over wireless channels. In Stage~I, devices perform local multi-modal self-supervised learning to obtain shared and modality-specific encoders without device--server exchange, thereby reducing the communication cost. In Stage~II, distributed fine-tuning with centralized evidential fusion calibrates per-modality uncertainty and reliably aggregates features distorted by noise or channel fading. In Stage~III, an uncertainty-guided feedback mechanism selectively requests additional features for uncertain samples, optimizing the communication--accuracy tradeoff in the distributed setting. Experiments on RGB--depth indoor scene classification show that the proposed framework attains higher accuracy with far fewer training communication rounds and remains robust to modality degradation or channel variation, outperforming existing self-supervised and fully supervised baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8fb9\u7f18\u667a\u80fd\u4e2d\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u4fe1\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u672c\u5730\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0e\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u878d\u5408\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8bad\u7ec3\u901a\u4fe1\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6297\u566a\u548c\u6297\u4fe1\u9053\u53d8\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8fb9\u7f18\u667a\u80fd\u9762\u4e34\u4e25\u91cd\u6311\u6218\uff1a1\uff09\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u5de8\u5927\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u591a\u53d8\u4fe1\u9053\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u4e0b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u6709\u9650\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\n- \u9636\u6bb51\uff1a\u8bbe\u5907\u672c\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u83b7\u53d6\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bbe\u5907-\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u901a\u4fe1\u3002\n- \u9636\u6bb52\uff1a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u8bc1\u636e\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u6821\u51c6\u5404\u6a21\u6001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5e76\u805a\u5408\u53d7\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u4fe1\u9053\u8870\u51cf\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002\n- \u9636\u6bb53\uff1a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6837\u672c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u8bf7\u6c42\u989d\u5916\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u5728RGB-\u6df1\u5ea6\u5ba4\u5185\u573a\u666f\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\n- \u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u901a\u4fe1\u8f6e\u6570\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\n- \u5bf9\u6a21\u6001\u9000\u5316\u6216\u4fe1\u9053\u53d8\u5316\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\n- \u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u5168\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8fb9\u7f18\u667a\u80fd\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u672c\u5730\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u878d\u5408\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u901a\u4fe1\u5f00\u9500\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

While Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have advanced scene representation, their capacity to capture high-frequency facial details, such as dynamic wrinkles and subtle textures from information-constrained monocular streams, requires significant enhancement. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel hybrid neural radiance field framework, called Geometry-Aware-Transformer Enhanced NeRF (GAT-NeRF) for high-fidelity and controllable 4D facial avatar reconstruction, which integrates the Transformer mechanism into the NeRF pipeline. GAT-NeRF synergistically combines a coordinate-aligned Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with a lightweight Transformer module, termed as Geometry-Aware-Transformer (GAT) due to its processing of multi-modal inputs containing explicit geometric priors. The GAT module is enabled by fusing multi-modal input features, including 3D spatial coordinates, 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) expression parameters, and learnable latent codes to effectively learn and enhance feature representations pertinent to fine-grained geometry. The Transformer's effective feature learning capabilities are leveraged to significantly augment the modeling of complex local facial patterns like dynamic wrinkles and acne scars. Comprehensive experiments unequivocally demonstrate GAT-NeRF's state-of-the-art performance in visual fidelity and high-frequency detail recovery, forging new pathways for creating realistic dynamic digital humans for multimedia applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While effective, this paradigm struggles to incorporate contextual features and fails to capture semantic relationships among classes. To address these limitations, we propose InstructTime, a novel framework that reformulates time series classification as a multimodal generative task. Specifically, continuous numerical sequences, contextual textual features, and task instructions are treated as multimodal inputs, while class labels are generated as textual outputs by tuned language models. To bridge the modality gap, InstructTime introduces a time series discretization module that converts continuous sequences into discrete temporal tokens, together with an alignment projection layer and a generative self-supervised pre-training strategy to enhance cross-modal representation alignment. Building upon this framework, we further propose InstructTime++, which extends InstructTime by incorporating implicit feature modeling to compensate for the limited inductive bias of language models. InstructTime++ leverages specialized toolkits to mine informative implicit patterns from raw time series and contextual inputs, including statistical feature extraction and vision-language-based image captioning, and translates them into textual descriptions for seamless integration.

Thus, for accurately generating contextually-relevant images, knowledge and reasoning about time can be crucial (e.g., for generating a landscape in spring vs. in winter). Yet, although substantial work exists on understanding and improving temporal knowledge in natural language processing, research on how temporal phenomena appear and are handled in text-to-image (T2I) models remains scarce. We address this gap with TempViz, the first data set to holistically evaluate temporal knowledge in image generation, consisting of 7.9k prompts and more than 600 reference images. Using TempViz, we study the capabilities of five T2I models across five temporal knowledge categories.

This absence of verifiable, sample-level traceability leaves practitioners and users unable to determine whether a specific sample was used, when it was processed, or whether the corresponding records remain intact over time. We introduce FG-Trac, a model-agnostic framework that establishes verifiable, fine-grained sample-level traceability throughout machine learning pipelines. FG-Trac defines an explicit mechanism for capturing and verifying sample lifecycle events across preprocessing and training, computes contribution scores explicitly grounded in training checkpoints, and anchors these traces to tamper-evident cryptographic commitments. The framework integrates without modifying model architectures or training objectives, reconstructing complete and auditable data-usage histories with practical computational overhead. Experiments on a canonical convolutional neural network and a multimodal graph learning pipeline demonstrate that FG-Trac preserves predictive performance while enabling machine learning systems to furnish verifiable evidence of how individual samples were used and propagated during model execution.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our framework is built upon an auto-regressive diffusion transformer that models the entire video sequence to ensure long-range temporal coherence. To mitigate error accumulation inherent in auto-regressive generation, we introduce a novel skip-concatenate sampling strategy that effectively maintains temporal stability. Furthermore, LDF-VFI incorporates sparse, local attention and tiled VAE encoding, a combination that not only enables efficient processing of long sequences but also allows generalization to arbitrary spatial resolutions (e.g., 4K) at inference without retraining. An enhanced conditional VAE decoder, which leverages multi-scale features from the input video, further improves reconstruction fidelity. Empirically, LDF-VFI achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging long-sequence benchmarks, demonstrating superior per-frame quality and temporal consistency, especially in scenes with large motion.

One of the main challenges associated with this task is the frequent substitutions that occur during a game, which results in highly sparse data. In particular, a National Basketball Association (NBA) team will use more than 600 lineups during a season, which translates to an average lineup having seen the court in approximately 25-30 possessions. Inevitably, any statistics that one collects for these lineups are going to be noisy, with low predictive value. Yet, there is no existing work (in the public at least) that addresses this problem. In this work, we propose a regression-based approach that controls for the opposition faced by each lineup, while it also utilizes information about the players making up the lineups.

Existing TBPS methods therefore rely on dataset-centric fine-tuning to handle distribution shift, resulting in multiple independently trained models for different datasets. While synthetic data can increase the scale needed to fine-tune VLMs, it does not eliminate dataset-specific adaptation. This motivates a fundamental question: can we train a single unified TBPS model across multiple datasets? We show that naive joint training over all datasets remains sub-optimal because current training paradigms do not scale to a large number of unique person identities and are vulnerable to noisy image-text pairs. To address these challenges, we propose Scale-TBPS with two contributions: (i) a noise-aware unified dataset curation strategy that cohesively merges diverse TBPS datasets; and (ii) a scalable discriminative identity learning framework that remains effective under a large number of unique identities.

However, existing video evaluation benchmarks primarily focus on non-interactive videos, such as movies and recordings. To fill this gap, this paper proposes the first omnimodal benchmark for interactive livestream videos, LiViBench. It features a diverse set of 24 tasks, highlighting the perceptual, reasoning, and livestream-specific challenges. To efficiently construct the dataset, we design a standardized semi-automatic annotation workflow that incorporates the human-in-the-loop at multiple stages. The workflow leverages multiple MLLMs to form a multi-agent system for comprehensive video description and uses a seed-question-driven method to construct high-quality annotations. All interactive videos in the benchmark include audio, speech, and real-time comments modalities. To enhance models' understanding of interactive videos, we design tailored two-stage instruction-tuning and propose a Video-to-Comment Retrieval (VCR) module to improve the model's ability to utilize real-time comments. Based on these advancements, we develop LiVi-LLM-7B, an MLLM with enhanced knowledge of interactive livestreams. Experiments show that our model outperforms larger open-source models with up to 72B parameters, narrows the gap with leading proprietary models on LiViBench, and achieves enhanced performance on general video benchmarks, including VideoMME, LongVideoBench, MLVU, and VideoEval-Pro.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u4e92\u52a8\u76f4\u64ad\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u5168\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6LiViBench\uff0c\u5305\u542b24\u9879\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86LiVi-LLM-7B\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u4e92\u52a8\u76f4\u64ad\u89c6\u9891\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u8d85\u8d8a\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u975e\u4e92\u52a8\u89c6\u9891\uff08\u5982\u7535\u5f71\u3001\u5f55\u64ad\uff09\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u4e92\u52a8\u76f4\u64ad\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u4e92\u52a8\u76f4\u64ad\u89c6\u9891\u5305\u542b\u97f3\u9891\u3001\u8bed\u97f3\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u8bc4\u8bba\u7b49\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fd9\u7c7b\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0a\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "1. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u7684\u534a\u81ea\u52a8\u6ce8\u91ca\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4eba\u5728\u56de\u8def\u7684\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u6807\u6ce8\uff1b2. \u6784\u5efa\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u8fdb\u884c\u89c6\u9891\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u79cd\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\uff1b3. \u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4e92\u52a8\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6307\u4ee4\u5fae\u8c03\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u89c6\u9891\u5230\u8bc4\u8bba\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u5757\uff1b4. \u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0a\u8ff0\u6280\u672f\u5f00\u53d1LiVi-LLM-7B\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "1.

To address this gap, we introduce two key contributions: we construct BinauralVGGSound, the first large-scale video-binaural audio dataset designed to support spatially aware video-to-audio generation; and we propose a end-to-end spatial audio generation framework guided by visual cues, which explicitly models spatial features. Our framework incorporates a visual-guided audio spatialization module that ensures the generated audio exhibits realistic spatial attributes and layered spatial depth while maintaining semantic and temporal alignment. Experiments show that our approach substantially outperforms state-of-the-art models in spatial fidelity and delivers a more immersive auditory experience, without sacrificing temporal or semantic consistency.

In this project, we instead study MoE behavior in an image classification setting, focusing on predictive performance, expert utilization, and generalization. We compare dense, SoftMoE, and SparseMoE classifier heads on the CIFAR10 dataset under comparable model capacity. Both MoE variants achieve slightly higher validation accuracy than the dense baseline while maintaining balanced expert utilization through regularization, avoiding expert collapse. To analyze generalization, we compute Hessian-based sharpness metrics at convergence, including the largest eigenvalue and trace of the loss Hessian, evaluated on both training and test data. We find that SoftMoE exhibits higher sharpness by these metrics, while Dense and SparseMoE lie in a similar curvature regime, despite all models achieving comparable generalization performance. Complementary loss surface perturbation analyses reveal qualitative differences in non-local behavior under finite parameter perturbations between dense and MoE models, which help contextualize curvature-based measurements without directly explaining validation accuracy. We further evaluate empirical inference efficiency and show that naively implemented conditional routing does not yield inference speedups on modern hardware at this scale, highlighting the gap between theoretical and realized efficiency in sparse MoE models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7814\u7a76MoE\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001SoftMoE\u548cSparseMoE\u5728CIFAR10\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0MoE\u53d8\u4f53\u5728\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u7565\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e13\u5bb6\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0SoftMoE\u7684Hessian\u9510\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7a00\u758fMoE\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u672a\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u591a\u6570MoE\u67b6\u6784\u7814\u7a76\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22MoE\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u4e13\u5bb6\u5229\u7528\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7814\u7a76\u5b9e\u9645\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u6761\u4ef6\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6548\u7387\u5b9e\u73b0\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u5728CIFAR10\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728\u53ef\u6bd4\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001SoftMoE\u548cSparseMoE\u4e09\u79cd\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u5934\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4fdd\u6301\u4e13\u5bb6\u5e73\u8861\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e13\u5bb6\u5d29\u6e83\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eHessian\u7684\u9510\u5ea6\u5ea6\u91cf\uff08\u6700\u5927\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u548c\u8ff9\uff09\u5206\u6790\u6536\u655b\u65f6\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8f85\u4ee5\u635f\u5931\u8868\u9762\u6270\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "1) MoE\u53d8\u4f53\uff08SoftMoE\u548cSparseMoE\uff09\u6bd4\u5bc6\u96c6\u57fa\u7ebf\u83b7\u5f97\u7a0d\u9ad8\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b2) SoftMoE\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684Hessian\u9510\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u5bc6\u96c6\u548cSparseMoE\u5904\u4e8e\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b3) \u635f\u5931\u8868\u9762\u6270\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u5bc6\u96c6\u548cMoE\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u9650\u53c2\u6570\u6270\u52a8\u4e0b\u7684\u975e\u5c40\u90e8\u884c\u4e3a\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b4) \u5728\u73b0\u6709\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\uff0c\u6734\u7d20\u5b9e\u73b0\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u8def\u7531\u672a\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "MoE\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u5bc6\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u7565\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e13\u5bb6\u5e73\u8861\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7a00\u758fMoE\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u52bf\u5728\u5f53\u524d\u786c\u4ef6\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0b\u672a\u80fd\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}

While prior DL methods have demonstrated varying levels of success, they often suffer from instability, limited fidelity, or poor robustness under realistic FL settings. We introduce a new DL attack that integrates a generative Flow Matching (FM) prior into the reconstruction process. By guiding optimization toward the distribution of realistic images (represented by a flow matching foundation model), our method enhances reconstruction fidelity without requiring knowledge of the private data. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and target models demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks across pixel-level, perceptual, and feature-based similarity metrics. Crucially, the method remains effective across different training epochs, larger client batch sizes, and under common defenses such as noise injection, clipping, and sparsification.

Although deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown great potential as an alternative to classical heuristics and exact solvers, existing DRL models often struggle to maintain training stability-failing to converge or generalize when constraints are dense. In this study, we propose a curriculum-based deep reinforcement learning (CB-DRL) framework designed to resolve this instability. The framework utilizes a structured three-phase curriculum that gradually increases problem complexity: the agent first learns distance and fleet optimization (Phase A), then battery management (Phase B), and finally the full EVRPTW (Phase C). To ensure stable learning across phases, the framework employs a modified proximal policy optimization algorithm with phase-specific hyperparameters, value and advantage clipping, and adaptive learning-rate scheduling. The policy network is built upon a heterogeneous graph attention encoder enhanced by global-local attention and feature-wise linear modulation. This specialized architecture explicitly captures the distinct properties of depots, customers, and charging stations. Trained exclusively on small instances with N=10 customers, the model demonstrates robust generalization to unseen instances ranging from N=5 to N=100, significantly outperforming standard baselines on medium-scale problems. Experimental results confirm that this curriculum-guided approach achieves high feasibility rates and competitive solution quality on out-of-distribution instances where standard DRL baselines fail, effectively bridging the gap between neural speed and operational reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing approaches still suffer from several limitations. For background regions obtained from decomposition, existing methods adopt a uniform suppression strategy for all patches, overlooking the varying contributions of different patches to the prediction. For foreground regions, existing methods fail to adequately consider that some local patches may exhibit appearance or semantic similarity to other classes, which may mislead the training process. To address these issues, we propose a new plug-and-play framework. This framework consists of three core components: (1) a Foreground-Background Decomposition module, which follows previous FG-BG methods to separate an image into foreground and background regions; (2) an Adaptive Background Suppression module, which adaptively weights patch classification entropy; and (3) a Confusable Foreground Rectification module, which identifies and rectifies confusable foreground patches. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed plug-and-play framework significantly improves the performance of existing FG-BG decomposition methods.

GNN quantization has emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and accelerating inference in resource-constrained environments. Compared to quantization in LLMs, quantizing graph features is more emphasized in GNNs. Inspired by the above, we propose to leverage prompt learning, which manipulates the input data, to improve the performance of quantization-aware training (QAT) for GNNs. To mitigate the issue that prompting the node features alone can only make part of the quantized aggregation result optimal, we introduce Low-Rank Aggregation Prompting (LoRAP), which injects lightweight, input-dependent prompts into each aggregated feature to optimize the results of quantized aggregations. Extensive evaluations on 4 leading QAT frameworks over 9 graph datasets demonstrate that LoRAP consistently enhances the performance of low-bit quantized GNNs while introducing a minimal computational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A critical obstacle is the inherent variability of cortical responses: neural activity elicited by the same visual stimulus differs across individuals and trials due to anatomical, functional, cognitive, and experimental factors, making fMRI-to-image reconstruction non-injective. In this paper, we tackle a challenging yet practically meaningful problem: zero-shot cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction, where the visual experience of a previously unseen individual must be reconstructed without subject-specific training. To enable principled evaluation, we present a unified cortical-surface dataset -- UniCortex-fMRI, assembled from multiple visual-stimulus fMRI datasets to provide broad coverage of subjects and stimuli. Our UniCortex-fMRI is particularly processed by standardized data formats to make it possible to explore this possibility in the zero-shot scenario of cross-subject fMRI-to-image reconstruction. To tackle the modeling challenge, we propose PictorialCortex, which models fMRI activity using a compositional latent formulation that structures stimulus-driven representations under subject-, dataset-, and trial-related variability. PictorialCortex operates in a universal cortical latent space and implements this formulation through a latent factorization--composition module, reinforced by paired factorization and re-factorizing consistency regularization. During inference, surrogate latents synthesized under multiple seen-subject conditions are aggregated to guide diffusion-based image synthesis for unseen subjects. Extensive experiments show that PictorialCortex improves zero-shot cross-subject visual reconstruction, highlighting the benefits of compositional latent modeling and multi-dataset training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPictorialCortex\u65b9\u6cd5\u548cUniCortex-fMRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5fMRI\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u6f5c\u5728\u56e0\u5b50\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u591a\u91cd\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u5347\u91cd\u5efa\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9\u523a\u6fc0\u5f15\u53d1\u7684\u5927\u8111\u76ae\u5c42\u6d3b\u52a8\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4e2a\u4f53\u95f4\u548c\u8bd5\u6b21\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4fMRI\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u6210\u4e3a\u975e\u5355\u5c04\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\uff08\u65e0\u7279\u5b9a\u88ab\u8bd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff09\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u91cd\u5efa\u65b0\u88ab\u8bd5\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u4f53\u9a8c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7ec4\u5408\u6f5c\u5728\u56e0\u5b50\u6a21\u578bPictorialCortex\uff0c\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u76ae\u5c42\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u89e3\u8026\u523a\u6fc0\u9a71\u52a8\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u4e2a\u4f53\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ca\u8bd5\u6b21\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u76ae\u5c42\u8868\u9762\u6570\u636e\u96c6UniCortex-fMRI\uff1b\u5229\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u56e0\u5b50\u5206\u89e3-\u7ec4\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u53ca\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u805a\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u5df2\u89c1\u88ab\u8bd5\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660ePictorialCortex\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u89c6\u89c9\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7ec4\u5408\u6f5c\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u6f5c\u5728\u56e0\u5b50\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u591a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u5bf9\u76ae\u5c42\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5fMRI\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u3002"}}

Existing Reinforcement Learning (RL) benchmarks and memory-augmented agents focus primarily on retention, leaving the equally critical ability of memory rewriting largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a benchmark that explicitly tests continual memory updating under partial observability, i.e. the natural setting where an agent must rely on memory rather than current observations, and use it to compare recurrent, transformer-based, and structured memory architectures. Our experiments reveal that classic recurrent models, despite their simplicity, demonstrate greater flexibility and robustness in memory rewriting tasks than modern structured memories, which succeed only under narrow conditions, and transformer-based agents, which often fail beyond trivial retention cases. These findings expose a fundamental limitation of current approaches and emphasize the necessity of memory mechanisms that balance stable retention with adaptive updating. Our work highlights this overlooked challenge, introduces benchmarks to evaluate it, and offers insights for designing future RL agents with explicit and trainable forgetting mechanisms.

However, conventional physics-based methods remain computationally expensive, hindering their application in time-sensitive scenarios. While graph neural networks (GNNs) offer promising acceleration, existing approaches exhibit poor cross-resolution generalisation, demonstrating significant performance degradation on higher-resolution meshes beyond the training distribution. This stems from two key factors: (1) existing GNNs employ fixed message-passing depth that fails to adapt information aggregation to mesh density variation, and (2) vertex-wise displacement magnitudes are inherently resolution-dependent in garment simulation. To address these issues, we introduce Propagation-before-Update Graph Network (Pb4U-GNet), a resolution-adaptive framework that decouples message propagation from feature updates. Pb4U-GNet incorporates two key mechanisms: (1) dynamic propagation depth control, adjusting message-passing iterations based on mesh resolution, and (2) geometry-aware update scaling, which scales predictions according to local mesh characteristics. Extensive experiments show that even trained solely on low-resolution meshes, Pb4U-GNet exhibits strong generalisability across diverse mesh resolutions, addressing a fundamental challenge in neural garment simulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

By comparing model representations before and after unlearning, we decompose the mutual information with the forgotten data into distinct components, formalizing the notions of unlearned and residual knowledge. Our analysis reveals that redundant information, shared across both models, constitutes residual knowledge that persists post-unlearning and correlates with susceptibility to known adversarial reconstruction attacks.

Existing training-based hateful video detection methods are constrained by limited training data and lack of interpretability, while directly prompting large vision-language models often struggle to deliver reliable hate detection. To address these challenges, this paper introduces MARS, a training-free Multi-stage Adversarial ReaSoning framework that enables reliable and interpretable hateful content detection. MARS begins with the objective description of video content, establishing a neutral foundation for subsequent analysis. Building on this, it develops evidence-based reasoning that supports potential hateful interpretations, while in parallel incorporating counter-evidence reasoning to capture plausible non-hateful perspectives. Finally, these perspectives are synthesized into a conclusive and explainable decision. Extensive evaluation on two real-world datasets shows that MARS achieves up to 10% improvement under certain backbones and settings compared to other training-free approaches and outperforms state-of-the-art training-based methods on one dataset. In addition, MARS produces human-understandable justifications, thereby supporting compliance oversight and enhancing the transparency of content moderation workflows.

However, GFMs remain constrained by in-memory bottlenecks: they attempt to encode knowledge into model parameters, which limits semantic capacity, introduces heavy lossy compression with conflicts, and entangles graph representation with the knowledge in ways that hinder efficient adaptation, undermining scalability and interpretability. In this work,we propose RAG-GFM, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation aided Graph Foundation Model that offloads knowledge from parameters and complements parameterized learning. To externalize graph knowledge, we build a dual-modal unified retrieval module, where a semantic store from prefix-structured text and a structural store from centrality-based motif. To preserve heterogeneous information, we design a dual-view alignment objective that contrasts both modalities to capture both content and relational patterns. To enable efficient downstream adaptation, we perform in-context augmentation to enrich supporting instances with retrieved texts and motifs as contextual evidence.

Among these, bounding boxes stand out as particularly effective, often outperforming points while significantly reducing annotation costs. However, current training and evaluation protocols typically rely on synthetic prompts generated through simple heuristics, offering limited insight into real-world robustness. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of promptable segmentation models to natural variations in bounding box prompts. First, we conduct a controlled user study and collect thousands of real bounding box annotations. Our analysis reveals substantial variability in segmentation quality across users for the same model and instance, indicating that SAM-like models are highly sensitive to natural prompt noise. Then, since exhaustive testing of all possible user inputs is computationally prohibitive, we reformulate robustness evaluation as a white-box optimization problem over the bounding box prompt space. We introduce BREPS, a method for generating adversarial bounding boxes that minimize or maximize segmentation error while adhering to naturalness constraints.

Source Code: https://github.com/bostankhan6/DeepFedNAS", "summary": "Federated Neural Architecture Search (FedNAS) aims to automate model design for privacy-preserving Federated Learning (FL) but currently faces two critical bottlenecks: unguided supernet training that yields suboptimal models, and costly multi-hour pipelines for post-training subnet discovery. We introduce DeepFedNAS, a novel, two-phase framework underpinned by a principled, multi-objective fitness function that synthesizes mathematical network design with architectural heuristics. Enabled by a re-engineered supernet, DeepFedNAS introduces Federated Pareto Optimal Supernet Training, which leverages a pre-computed Pareto-optimal cache of high-fitness architectures as an intelligent curriculum to optimize shared supernet weights. Subsequently, its Predictor-Free Search Method eliminates the need for costly accuracy surrogates by utilizing this fitness function as a direct, zero-cost proxy for accuracy, enabling on-demand subnet discovery in mere seconds. DeepFedNAS achieves state-of-the-art accuracy (e.g., up to 1.21% absolute improvement on CIFAR-100), superior parameter and communication efficiency, and a substantial ~61x speedup in total post-training search pipeline time. By reducing the pipeline from over 20 hours to approximately 20 minutes (including initial cache generation) and enabling 20-second individual subnet searches, DeepFedNAS makes hardware-aware FL deployments instantaneous and practical.

However, for parameter-constrained models (e.g., 4B--7B), the exploration phase is often plagued by frequent execution failures, creating noisy trajectories that hinder policy optimization. Under standard outcome-based reward settings, this noise leads to a critical credit assignment issue, where erroneous actions are inadvertently reinforced alongside successful outcomes. Existing mitigations face a dilemma: dense rewards often trigger reward hacking, while supersampling incurs prohibitive computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose CLEANER. Distinct from external filtering methods, CLEANER exploits the model's intrinsic self-correction capabilities to eliminate error-contaminated context directly during data collection. At its core, the Similarity-Aware Adaptive Rollback (SAAR) mechanism autonomously constructs clean, purified trajectories by retrospectively replacing failures with successful self-corrections. Based on semantic similarity, SAAR adaptively regulates replacement granularity from shallow execution repairs to deep reasoning substitutions. By training on these self-purified paths, the model internalizes correct reasoning patterns rather than error-recovery loops. Empirical results on AIME24/25, GPQA, and LiveCodeBench show average accuracy gains of 6%, 3%, and 5% over baselines. Notably, CLEANER matches state-of-the-art performance using only one-third of the training steps, highlighting trajectory purification as a scalable solution for efficient agentic RL.

To obtain a clearer picture of recent developments, we compile a unified corpus of more than 100,000 papers from 22 major conferences between 2020 and 2025 and construct a multidimensional profiling pipeline to organize and analyze their textual content.

We prove that despite training solely on final-answer correctness, gradient flow drives the model to converge to a structured, interpretable algorithm that iteratively traverses the graph vertex-by-vertex. We characterize the distributional properties required for this emergence, identifying the critical role of \"simple examples\": instances requiring fewer reasoning steps. When the training distribution places sufficient mass on these simpler instances, the model learns a generalizable traversal strategy that extrapolates to longer chains; when this mass vanishes, gradient-based learning becomes infeasible.

All models were evaluated on a four-class AD classification task comprising Mild Dementia, Moderate Dementia, Non-Demented, and Very Mild Dementia categories. Experimental findings show that CNN architectures consistently achieved strong performance, with ResNet50 attaining 98.83% accuracy. Transformer models demonstrated competitive generalization capabilities, with ViT achieving the highest accuracy among them at 95.38%. However, individual Transformer variants exhibited greater class-specific instability. The proposed Evan_V2 hybrid model, which integrates outputs from ten CNN and Transformer architectures through feature-level fusion, achieved the best overall performance with 99.99% accuracy, 0.9989 F1-score, and 0.9968 ROC AUC. Confusion matrix analysis further confirmed that Evan_V2 substantially reduced misclassification across all dementia stages, outperforming every standalone model.

This challenge is particularly acute for best paper awards, which are an important part of the peer review process, yet whose selection has increasingly become a subject of debate in recent years. In this paper, we introduce an author-assisted mechanism to facilitate the selection of best paper awards. Our method employs the Isotonic Mechanism for eliciting authors' assessments of their own submissions in the form of a ranking, which is subsequently utilized to adjust the raw review scores for optimal estimation of the submissions' ground-truth quality. We demonstrate that authors are incentivized to report truthfully when their utility is a convex additive function of the adjusted scores, and we validate this convexity assumption for best paper awards using publicly accessible review data of ICLR from 2019 to 2023 and NeurIPS from 2021 to 2023. Crucially, in the special case where an author has a single quota -- that is, may nominate only one paper -- we prove that truthfulness holds even when the utility function is merely nondecreasing and additive. This finding represents a substantial relaxation of the assumptions required in prior work. For practical implementation, we extend our mechanism to accommodate the common scenario of overlapping authorship. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that our mechanism significantly improves the quality of papers selected for awards.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing methods relying solely on 3D diffusion models tend to suffer a degradation in appearance details, while those utilizing only 2D diffusion models typically compromise camera controllability. To overcome this limitation, we propose ScenDi, a method for urban scene generation that integrates both 3D and 2D diffusion models. We first train a 3D latent diffusion model to generate 3D Gaussians, enabling the rendering of images at a relatively low resolution. To enable controllable synthesis, this 3DGS generation process can be optionally conditioned by specifying inputs such as 3d bounding boxes, road maps, or text prompts. Then, we train a 2D video diffusion model to enhance appearance details conditioned on rendered images from the 3D Gaussians. By leveraging the coarse 3D scene as guidance for 2D video diffusion, ScenDi generates desired scenes based on input conditions and successfully adheres to accurate camera trajectories.

This study explores the viability of 2D projection-based vertebra segmentation for vertebra-level fracture detection in 3D CT volumes, presenting an end-to-end pipeline for automated analysis of cervical vertebrae (C1-C7). By approximating a 3D volume through optimized 2D axial, sagittal, and coronal projections, regions of interest are identified using the YOLOv8 model from all views and combined to approximate the 3D cervical spine area, achieving a 3D mIoU of 94.45 percent. This projection-based localization strategy reduces computational complexity compared to traditional 3D segmentation methods while maintaining high performance. It is followed by a DenseNet121-Unet-based multi-label segmentation leveraging variance- and energy-based projections, achieving a Dice score of 87.86 percent. Strategic approximation of 3D vertebral masks from these 2D segmentation masks enables the extraction of individual vertebra volumes. The volumes are analyzed for fractures using an ensemble of 2.5D Spatio-Sequential models incorporating both raw slices and projections per vertebra for complementary evaluation. This ensemble achieves vertebra-level and patient-level F1 scores of 68.15 and 82.26, and ROC-AUC scores of 91.62 and 83.04, respectively. We further validate our approach through an explainability study that provides saliency map visualizations highlighting anatomical regions relevant for diagnosis, and an interobserver variability analysis comparing our model's performance with expert radiologists, demonstrating competitive results.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While feed-forward methods have made progress, they often struggle to generate plausible details in occluded regions and preserve the fundamental spatial relationships of objects. Such accurate generative reasoning capability for the entire 3D space is critical in real-world applications. In this paper, we present FlowSSC, the first generative framework applied directly to monocular semantic scene completion. FlowSSC treats the SSC task as a conditional generation problem and can seamlessly integrate with existing feed-forward SSC methods to significantly boost their performance. To achieve real-time inference without compromising quality, we introduce Shortcut Flow-matching that operates in a compact triplane latent space. Unlike standard diffusion models that require hundreds of steps, our method utilizes a shortcut mechanism to achieve high-fidelity generation in a single step, enabling practical deployment in autonomous systems. Extensive experiments on SemanticKITTI demonstrate that FlowSSC achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We find that prior (absolute or relative) encoding schemes for multi-view attention do not meet the above desiderata, and present RayRoPE to address this gap. RayRoPE represents patch positions based on associated rays but leverages a predicted point along the ray instead of the direction for a geometry-aware encoding. To achieve SE(3) invariance, RayRoPE computes query-frame projective coordinates for computing multi-frequency similarity. Lastly, as the 'predicted' 3D point along a ray may not be precise, RayRoPE presents a mechanism to analytically compute the expected position encoding under uncertainty. We validate RayRoPE on the tasks of novel-view synthesis and stereo depth estimation and show that it consistently improves over alternate position encoding schemes (e.g. 15% relative improvement on LPIPS in CO3D).

Despite remarkable progress in world modeling, current methods still suffer from severe instability and temporal degradation, often leading to spatial drift and scene collapse during long-horizon interactions. To better understand this issue, we initially investigate the underlying causes of instability and identify that the major source of error accumulation originates from the same scene, where generated frames gradually deviate from the initial clean state and propagate errors to subsequent frames. Building upon this observation, we propose a simple yet effective method, \\textbf{StableWorld}, a Dynamic Frame Eviction Mechanism. By continuously filtering out degraded frames while retaining geometrically consistent ones, StableWorld effectively prevents cumulative drift at its source, leading to more stable and temporal consistency of interactive generation. Promising results on multiple interactive video models, \\eg, Matrix-Game, Open-Oasis, and Hunyuan-GameCraft, demonstrate that StableWorld is model-agnostic and can be applied to different interactive video generation frameworks to substantially improve stability, temporal consistency, and generalization across diverse interactive scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, synthesizing high-quality videos that accurately reflect real-world robotic interactions remains challenging, and the lack of a standardized benchmark limits fair comparisons and progress. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive robotics benchmark, RBench, designed to evaluate robot-oriented video generation across five task domains and four distinct embodiments. It assesses both task-level correctness and visual fidelity through reproducible sub-metrics, including structural consistency, physical plausibility, and action completeness. Evaluation of 25 representative models highlights significant deficiencies in generating physically realistic robot behaviors. Furthermore, the benchmark achieves a Spearman correlation coefficient of 0.96 with human evaluations, validating its effectiveness. While RBench provides the necessary lens to identify these deficiencies, achieving physical realism requires moving beyond evaluation to address the critical shortage of high-quality training data.

We address this question by presenting the Egocentric World Model (EgoWM), a simple, architecture-agnostic method that transforms any pretrained video diffusion model into an action-conditioned world model, enabling controllable future prediction. Rather than training from scratch, we repurpose the rich world priors of Internet-scale video models and inject motor commands through lightweight conditioning layers. This allows the model to follow actions faithfully while preserving realism and strong generalization. Our approach scales naturally across embodiments and action spaces, ranging from 3-DoF mobile robots to 25-DoF humanoids, where predicting egocentric joint-angle-driven dynamics is substantially more challenging. The model produces coherent rollouts for both navigation and manipulation tasks, requiring only modest fine-tuning. To evaluate physical correctness independently of visual appearance, we introduce the Structural Consistency Score (SCS), which measures whether stable scene elements evolve consistently with the provided actions.

Existing inference-time strategies, such as parallel sampling with verifiers or simply increasing denoising steps, can improve prompt alignment but remain inadequate for richly compositional settings where many constraints must be satisfied. Inspired by the success of chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models, we propose an iterative test-time strategy in which a T2I model progressively refines its generations across multiple steps, guided by feedback from a vision-language model as the critic in the loop. Our approach is simple, requires no external tools or priors, and can be flexibly applied to a wide range of image generators and vision-language models. Empirically, we demonstrate consistent gains on image generation across benchmarks: a 16.9% improvement in all-correct rate on ConceptMix (k=7), a 13.8% improvement on T2I-CompBench (3D-Spatial category) and a 12.5% improvement on Visual Jenga scene decomposition compared to compute-matched parallel sampling. Beyond quantitative gains, iterative refinement produces more faithful generations by decomposing complex prompts into sequential corrections, with human evaluators preferring our method 58.7% of the time over 41.3% for the parallel baseline. Together, these findings highlight iterative self-correction as a broadly applicable principle for compositional image generation.

To reduce both the memory and latency of these systems, practitioners quantize their learned parameters, typically at half precision. A growing body of research focuses on preserving the model performance with more aggressive bit widths, and some work has been done to apply these strategies to other models, like vision transformers. In our study we investigate how a variety of quantization methods, including state-of-the-art GPTQ and AWQ, can be applied effectively to multimodal pipelines comprised of vision models, language models, and their connectors. We address how performance on captioning, retrieval, and question answering can be affected by bit width, quantization method, and which portion of the pipeline the quantization is used for. Results reveal that ViT and LLM exhibit comparable importance in model performance, despite significant differences in parameter size, and that lower-bit quantization of the LLM achieves high accuracy at reduced bits per weight (bpw). These findings provide practical insights for efficient deployment of MLLMs and highlight the value of exploration for understanding component sensitivities in multimodal models.

However, since real ground truth for face swapping is unavailable, achieving both accurate identity transfer and high-quality attribute preservation remains challenging. In addition, recent diffusion-based approaches attempt to improve visual fidelity through conditional inpainting on masked target images, but the masked condition removes crucial appearance cues of target, resulting in plausible yet misaligned attributes. To address these limitations, we propose APPLE (Attribute-Preserving Pseudo-Labeling), a diffusion-based teacher-student framework that enhances attribute fidelity through attribute-aware pseudo-label supervision. We reformulate face swapping as a conditional deblurring task to more faithfully preserve target-specific attributes such as lighting, skin tone, and makeup. In addition, we introduce an attribute-aware inversion scheme to further improve detailed attribute preservation. Through an elaborate attribute-preserving design for teacher learning, APPLE produces high-quality pseudo triplets that explicitly provide the student with direct face-swapping supervision. Overall, APPLE achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of attribute preservation and identity transfer, producing more photorealistic and target-faithful results.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faAPPLE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u76d1\u7763\u6539\u8fdb\u6362\u8138\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u8fc1\u79fb\u8d28\u91cf", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6362\u8138\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u5b9e\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u5982\u59ff\u6001\u3001\u8868\u60c5\u3001\u5149\u7167\u3001\u80a4\u8272\u3001\u5986\u5bb9\uff09\u4fdd\u7559\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u5c1d\u8bd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6761\u4ef6\u4fee\u590d\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u63a9\u7801\u64cd\u4f5c\u4f1a\u4e22\u5931\u5173\u952e\u5c5e\u6027\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5c5e\u6027\u9519\u4f4d", "method": "1) \u5c06\u6362\u8138\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u4efb\u52a1\u4ee5\u4fdd\u7559\u76ee\u6807\u5c5e\u6027 2) \u91c7\u7528\u5c5e\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u53cd\u6f14\u65b9\u6848\u63d0\u5347\u7ec6\u8282\u4fdd\u5b58 3) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u5c5e\u6027\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4 4) \u6559\u5e08-\u5b66\u751f\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u8fc7\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b", "result": "\u5728\u5c5e\u6027\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u8eab\u4efd\u8fc1\u79fb\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5177\u7167\u7247\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u4e14\u5fe0\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u7ed3\u679c", "conclusion": "APPLE\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c5e\u6027\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u6761\u4ef6\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6362\u8138\u4e2d\u8eab\u4efd\u8fc1\u79fb\u4e0e\u5c5e\u6027\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u6362\u8138\u6548\u679c"}}
