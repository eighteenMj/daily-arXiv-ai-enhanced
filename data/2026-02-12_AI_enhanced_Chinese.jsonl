When both endpoints possess strong predictors -- as in modern large language models and related generative priors -- literal symbol transport is no longer the only operational regime. We propose predictive-state communication (PSC), in which the transmitter and receiver maintain an explicit shared predictive state, and the physical channel is used primarily to convey innovations, i.e., corrective information that reconciles the receiver's provisional trajectory with the transmitter's realized trajectory. This viewpoint replaces entropy-rate accounting by cross-entropy accounting under model mismatch, and it introduces feasibility constraints that depend jointly on capacity, delay, and perceptual continuity requirements; the resulting operating set is typically a bounded perception-capacity band rather than a one-sided threshold. We outline the protocol and architectural implications (state identifiers, anchors, bounded rollback, and patch-based updates) and provide a stylized illustrative example to visualize the induced feasibility region and its dependence on predictive quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this systematic review, we synthesize recent AI-driven approaches developed between January 2020 and April 2025 for modeling and correcting brain deformation. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, and Web of Science, with predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria focused on computational methods applied to brain deformation compensation for neurosurgical imaging, resulting in 41 studies meeting these criteria. We provide a unified analysis of methodological strategies, including deep learning-based image registration, direct deformation field regression, synthesis-driven multimodal alignment, resection-aware architectures addressing missing correspondences, and hybrid models that integrate biomechanical priors. We also examine dataset utilization, reported evaluation metrics, validation protocols, and how uncertainty and generalization have been assessed across studies. While AI-based deformation models demonstrate promising performance and computational efficiency, current approaches exhibit limitations in out-of-distribution robustness, standardized benchmarking, interpretability, and readiness for clinical deployment. Our review highlights these gaps and outlines opportunities for future research aimed at achieving more robust, generalizable, and clinically translatable deformation compensation solutions for neurosurgical guidance.

Prior work on modified Rankin Scale (mRS) prediction has relied primarily on structured variables (e.g., age, NIHSS) and conventional machine learning. The ability of large language models (LLMs) to infer future mRS scores directly from routine admission notes remains largely unexplored. We evaluated encoder (BERT, NYUTron) and generative (Llama-3.1-8B, MedGemma-4B) LLMs, in both frozen and fine-tuned settings, for discharge and 90-day mRS prediction using a large, real-world stroke registry. The discharge outcome dataset included 9,485 History and Physical notes and the 90-day outcome dataset included 1,898 notes from the NYU Langone Get With The Guidelines-Stroke registry (2016-2025). Data were temporally split with the most recent 12 months held out for testing. Performance was assessed using exact (7-class) mRS accuracy and binary functional outcome (mRS 0-2 vs. 3-6) accuracy and compared against established structured-data baselines incorporating NIHSS and age. Fine-tuned Llama achieved the highest performance, with 90-day exact mRS accuracy of 33.9% [95% CI, 27.9-39.9%] and binary accuracy of 76.3% [95% CI, 70.7-81.9%]. Discharge performance reached 42.0% [95% CI, 39.0-45.0%] exact accuracy and 75.0% [95% CI, 72.4-77.6%] binary accuracy. For 90-day prediction, Llama performed comparably to structured-data baselines.

Unfortunately, an adversary can corrupt the measurement data during transmission from the local-BMS to the cloud-BMS, leading to disrupted EV charging. Therefore, to ensure reliable voltage data under such sensor attacks, this paper proposes a two-stage error-corrected self-learning Koopman operator-based secure voltage estimation scheme for large-format battery packs. The first stage of correction compensates for the Koopman approximation error. The second stage aims to recover the error amassing from the lack of higher-order battery dynamics information in the self-learning feedback, using two alternative methods: an adaptable empirical strategy that uses cell-level knowledge of open circuit voltage to state-of-charge mapping for pack-level estimation, and a Gaussian process regression-based data-driven method that leverages minimal data-training. During our comprehensive case studies using the high-fidelity battery simulation package 'PyBaMM-liionpack', our proposed secure estimator reliably generated real-time voltage estimation with high accuracy under varying pack topologies, charging settings, battery age-levels, and attack policies. Thus, the scalable and adaptable algorithm can be easily employed to diverse battery configurations and operating conditions, without requiring significant modifications, excessive data or sensor redundancy, to ensure optimum charging of EVs under compromised sensing.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bef\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u81ea\u5b66\u4e60Koopman\u7b97\u5b50\u5b89\u5168\u7535\u538b\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4fdd\u969c\u8f66\u8f86\u5230\u7535\u7f51\u6280\u672f\u4e0b\u7535\u52a8\u6c7d\u8f66\u5145\u7535\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e91\u7535\u6c60\u7ba1\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u5b9e\u65f6\u7535\u538b\u6570\u636e\u786e\u4fdd\u53cc\u5411\u5145\u7535\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u8f93\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u6613\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u7834\u574f\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u5145\u7535\u4e2d\u65ad\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7535\u538b\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e94\u5bf9\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bef\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u7684\u81ea\u5b66\u4e60Koopman\u7b97\u5b50\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u8865\u507fKoopman\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u6062\u590d\u9ad8\u9636\u7535\u6c60\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4fe1\u606f\u8bef\u5dee\u2014\u2014\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f00\u8def\u7535\u538b\u4e0e\u8377\u7535\u72b6\u6001\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u8fc7\u7a0b\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528PyBaMM-liionpack\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7535\u6c60\u4eff\u771f\u5305\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u7535\u6c60\u62d3\u6251\u3001\u5145\u7535\u8bbe\u7f6e\u3001\u7535\u6c60\u8001\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9760\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5b9e\u65f6\u7535\u538b\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u4fee\u6539\u3001\u8fc7\u591a\u6570\u636e\u6216\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u5373\u53ef\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6837\u7684\u7535\u6c60\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u8fd0\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u53d7\u653b\u51fb\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5145\u7535\u3002"}}

We begin by analyzing the fundamental challenges of fusing visual and linguistic information in charts. We then categorize downstream tasks and datasets, introducing a novel taxonomy of canonical and non-canonical benchmarks to highlight the field's expanding scope. Subsequently, we present a comprehensive evolution of methodologies, tracing the progression from classic deep learning techniques to state-of-the-art MLLM paradigms that leverage sophisticated fusion strategies. By critically examining the limitations of current models, particularly their perceptual and reasoning deficits, we identify promising future directions, including advanced alignment techniques and reinforcement learning for cognitive enhancement.

At inference, synthetic masks are obtained by decoding denoised latent vectors through the frozen VAE decoder, with optional coarse control over lesion presence via a binary prompt.\n  Qualitative results show that the generated masks preserve global brain anatomy, discrete tissue semantics, and realistic variability, while avoiding the structural artifacts commonly observed in pixel-space generative models.

However, existing medical benchmarks remain static, suffering from two critical limitations: (1) data contamination, where test sets inadvertently leak into training corpora, leading to inflated performance estimates; and (2) temporal misalignment, failing to capture the rapid evolution of medical knowledge. Furthermore, current evaluation metrics for open-ended clinical reasoning often rely on either shallow lexical overlap (e.g., ROUGE) or subjective LLM-as-a-Judge scoring, both inadequate for verifying clinical correctness. To bridge these gaps, we introduce LiveMedBench, a continuously updated, contamination-free, and rubric-based benchmark that weekly harvests real-world clinical cases from online medical communities, ensuring strict temporal separation from model training data. We propose a Multi-Agent Clinical Curation Framework that filters raw data noise and validates clinical integrity against evidence-based medical principles. For evaluation, we develop an Automated Rubric-based Evaluation Framework that decomposes physician responses into granular, case-specific criteria, achieving substantially stronger alignment with expert physicians than LLM-as-a-Judge. To date, LiveMedBench comprises 2,756 real-world cases spanning 38 medical specialties and multiple languages, paired with 16,702 unique evaluation criteria. Extensive evaluation of 38 LLMs reveals that even the best-performing model achieves only 39.2%, and 84% of models exhibit performance degradation on post-cutoff cases, confirming pervasive data contamination risks. Error analysis further identifies contextual application-not factual knowledge-as the dominant bottleneck, with 35-48% of failures stemming from the inability to tailor medical knowledge to patient-specific constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "LiveMedBench\u8bba\u6587\u6458\u8981\u5206\u6790\uff1a\u9488\u5bf9\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e0bLLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u9759\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u548c\u65f6\u6548\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\u3001\u65e0\u6c61\u67d3\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u89c4\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u7597\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\uff08\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u9732\u5230\u8bad\u7ec3\u96c6\uff09\u548c\u65f6\u6548\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff08\u65e0\u6cd5\u8ddf\u4e0a\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\uff09\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bcd\u6c47\u91cd\u53e0\u6216LLM\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u5206\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e34\u5e8a\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e9f\u9700\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u6784\u5efaLiveMedBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff1a\u6bcf\u5468\u4ece\u5728\u7ebf\u533b\u7597\u793e\u533a\u6536\u96c6\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u79bb\uff1b2\uff09\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e34\u5e8a\u7b5b\u9009\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u8fc7\u6ee4\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5faa\u8bc1\u533b\u5b66\u539f\u5219\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff1b3\uff09\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u91cf\u89c4\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5c06\u533b\u751f\u56de\u7b54\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7684\u75c5\u4f8b\u7279\u5b9a\u6807\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u51c6\u5305\u542b2,756\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6848\u4f8b\uff08\u6db5\u76d638\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u4e13\u4e1a\u3001\u591a\u79cd\u8bed\u8a00\uff09\u548c16,702\u4e2a\u552f\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u8bc4\u4f3038\u4e2aLLM\u663e\u793a\uff1a\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u5f9739.2%\u5206\uff1b84%\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u622a\u6b62\u671f\u540e\u6848\u4f8b\u4e0a\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff08\u8bc1\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u98ce\u9669\uff09\uff1b35-48%\u5931\u8d25\u6e90\u4e8e\u65e0\u6cd5\u5c06\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u9002\u914d\u5230\u60a3\u8005\u7279\u5b9a\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5e94\u7528\u6210\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u6c61\u67d3\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6301\u7eed\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u6c61\u67d3free\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5e94\u7528\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u800c\u975e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u77e5\u8bc6\uff09\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002"}}

This expanded functionality introduces a new mode of signal propagation, enabling new forms of wireless communication. In this paper, we provide an analytical performance characterization of an E-FAS-enabled wireless link. We first develop a physics-consistent end-to-end channel model that couples a surface-impedance wave formulation with small-scale fading on both the base station (BS)-surface and launcher-user segments. We illustrate that the resulting effective BS-user channel remains circularly symmetric complex Gaussian, with an enhanced average power that explicitly captures surface-wave attenuation and junction losses. For single-user cases with linear precoding, we derive the outage probability and ergodic capacity in closed forms, together with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) asymptotics that quantify the gain of E-FAS over purely space-wave propagation. For the multiuser case with zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, we derive the distribution of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and obtain tractable approximations for the ergodic sum-rate, explicitly revealing how the E-FAS macro-gain interacts with the BS spatial degrees of freedom (DoF). In summary, our analysis shows that E-FAS preserves the diversity order dictated by small-scale fading while improving the coding gain enabled by cylindrical surface-wave propagation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We propose a novel internet router architecture that employs these technologies to achieve a petabit/sec router within a single integrated package. At the top-level, we introduce a novel split-parallel switch architecture that spatially divides (without processing) the incoming fibers and distributes them across smaller independent switches without intermediate OEO conversions or fine-tuned per-packet load-balancing. This passive spatial division enables scaling at the cost of a coarser traffic load balancing. Yet, through extensive evaluations of backbone network traffic, we demonstrate that differences with fine-tuned approaches are small. In addition, we propose a novel HBM-based shared-memory architecture for the implementation of the smaller independent switches, and we introduce a novel parallel frame interleaving algorithm that packs traffic into frames so that HBM banks are accessed at peak HBM data rates in a cyclical interleaving manner. We further discuss why these new technologies represent a paradigm shift in the design of future internet routers. Finally, we emphasize that power consumption may constitute the primary bottleneck to scaling.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, most existing methods focus only on the visual modality and compute prototypes directly from raw support images, which lack comprehensive and rich multimodal information. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Multimodal Prototype Augmentation FSL framework called MPA, including LLM-based Multi-Variant Semantic Enhancement (LMSE), Hierarchical Multi-View Augmentation (HMA), and an Adaptive Uncertain Class Absorber (AUCA). LMSE leverages large language models to generate diverse paraphrased category descriptions, enriching the support set with additional semantic cues. HMA exploits both natural and multi-view augmentations to enhance feature diversity (e.g., changes in viewing distance, camera angles, and lighting conditions). AUCA models uncertainty by introducing uncertain classes via interpolation and Gaussian sampling, effectively absorbing uncertain samples. Extensive experiments on four single-domain and six cross-domain FSL benchmarks demonstrate that MPA achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods across most settings.

One of its most severe complications is diabetic retinopathy (DR), a progressive retinal disease caused by microvascular damage, leading to hemorrhages, exudates, and potential vision loss. Early and reliable detection of DR is therefore critical for preventing irreversible blindness.\n  In this work, we propose an uncertainty-aware deep learning framework for automated DR severity grading that explicitly models the ordinal nature of disease progression. Our approach combines a convolutional backbone with lesion-query attention pooling and an evidential Dirichlet-based ordinal regression head, enabling both accurate severity prediction and principled estimation of predictive uncertainty. The model is trained using an ordinal evidential loss with annealed regularization to encourage calibrated confidence under domain shift.\n  We evaluate the proposed method on a multi-domain training setup combining APTOS, Messidor-2, and a subset of EyePACS fundus datasets. Experimental results demonstrate strong cross-dataset generalization, achieving competitive classification accuracy and high quadratic weighted kappa on held-out test sets, while providing meaningful uncertainty estimates for low-confidence cases.

However, RL suffers from sample inefficiency and a lack of semantic interpretability in complex scenarios. Foundation Models, particularly Vision-Language Models (VLMs), can mitigate this by offering rich, context-aware knowledge, yet their high inference latency hinders deployment in high-frequency RL training loops. To bridge this gap, we present Found-RL, a platform tailored to efficiently enhance RL for AD using foundation models. A core innovation is the asynchronous batch inference framework, which decouples heavy VLM reasoning from the simulation loop, effectively resolving latency bottlenecks to support real-time learning. We introduce diverse supervision mechanisms: Value-Margin Regularization (VMR) and Advantage-Weighted Action Guidance (AWAG) to effectively distill expert-like VLM action suggestions into the RL policy. Additionally, we adopt high-throughput CLIP for dense reward shaping. We address CLIP's dynamic blindness via Conditional Contrastive Action Alignment, which conditions prompts on discretized speed/command and yields a normalized, margin-based bonus from context-specific action-anchor scoring. Found-RL provides an end-to-end pipeline for fine-tuned VLM integration and shows that a lightweight RL model can achieve near-VLM performance compared with billion-parameter VLMs while sustaining real-time inference (approx. 500 FPS).

However, current evaluation frameworks lack a consensus metric and suffer from two critical flaws: they often assume independence across time steps or variables, and they demonstrably lack sensitivity to tail events, the very occurrences that are most pivotal in real-world decision-making. To address these limitations, we propose two kernel-based metrics: the signature maximum mean discrepancy (Sig-MMD) and our novel censored Sig-MMD (CSig-MMD). By leveraging the signature kernel, these metrics capture complex inter-variate and inter-temporal dependencies and remain robust to missing data. Furthermore, CSig-MMD introduces a censoring scheme that prioritizes a forecaster's capability to predict tail events while strictly maintaining properness, a vital property for a good scoring rule. These metrics enable a more reliable evaluation of direct multi-step forecasting, facilitating the development of more robust probabilistic algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5f53\u524d\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5171\u8bc6\u6307\u6807\u3001\u5ffd\u7565\u591a\u53d8\u91cf\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u5bf9\u5c3e\u90e8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6838\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff1aSig-MMD\u548c\u65b0\u9896\u7684CSig-MMD", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a1) \u5047\u8bbe\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u6216\u53d8\u91cf\u95f4\u72ec\u7acb\uff1b2) \u5bf9\u5c3e\u90e8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u800c\u5c3e\u90e8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u8fd9\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5bf9\u591a\u6b65\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u7a33\u5065\u6982\u7387\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5f00\u53d1", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u6838\u7684\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u7b7e\u540d\u6700\u5927\u5e73\u5747\u5dee\u5f02(Sig-MMD)\u548c\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u622a\u65adSig-MMD(CSig-MMD)\u3002Sig-MMD\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u590d\u6742\u7684\u53d8\u91cf\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u7f3a\u5931\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\uff0cCSig-MMD\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u622a\u65ad\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u4fdd\u6301\u8bc4\u5206\u89c4\u5219\u9002\u5b9c\u6027\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u91cd\u70b9\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u6d4b\u8005\u5bf9\u5c3e\u90e8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b", "result": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6b65\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u6982\u7387\u7b97\u6cd5\u53d1\u5c55", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7Sig-MMD\u548cCSig-MMD\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u5c3e\u90e8\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u7684\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6982\u7387\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6"}}

In this work, we investigate the transfer of this paradigm to binary manifolds, a fundamental setting for generative modeling of discrete data. While $x$-prediction remains effective, we identify a latent structural mismatch that arises when it is coupled with velocity-based objectives ($v$-loss), leading to a time-dependent singular weighting that amplifies gradient sensitivity to approximation errors. Motivated by this observation, we formalize prediction-loss alignment as a necessary condition for flow matching training. We prove that re-aligning the objective to the signal space ($x$-loss) eliminates the singular weighting, yielding uniformly bounded gradients and enabling robust training under uniform timestep sampling without reliance on heuristic schedules.

However, the intensive computational and memory demands pose significant challenges for resource-constrained edge devices. To overcome these limitations, split federated learning (SFL) emerges as a promising solution that partitions the model into lightweight client-side and compute-intensive server-side sub-models, thus offloading the primary training workload to a powerful server. Nevertheless, high-dimensional activation exchanges in SFL lead to excessive communication overhead. To overcome this, we propose SplitCom, a communication-efficient SFL framework for LLMs that exploits temporal redundancy in activations across consecutive training epochs. Inspired by video compression, the core innovation of our framework lies in selective activation uploading only when a noticeable deviation from previous epochs occurs. To balance communication efficiency and learning performance, we introduce two adaptive threshold control schemes based on 1) bang-bang control or 2) deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based reinforcement learning. Moreover, we implement dimensionality reduction techniques to alleviate client-side memory requirements. Furthermore, we extend SplitCom to the U-shape architecture, ensuring the server never accesses clients' labels. Extensive simulations and laboratory experiments demonstrate that SplitCom reduces uplink communication costs by up to 98.6\\,\\% in its standard configuration and total communication costs by up to 95.8\\,\\% in its U-shape variant without noticeably compromising model performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

First, the aeroelastic system is modeled as two-dimensional coupled wave PDEs with internal anti-damping terms, derived by Piston theory and Hamilton's principle. Using Fourier series expansion, the 2-D problem is decomposed into a parameterized family of 1-D systems. For each mode, a full-state boundary feedback controller is designed via PDE backstepping transformation. To enable output-feedback implementation, a state observer is further designed to estimate the distributed states over the two-dimensional spatial domain. Through Lyapunov analysis, the exponential stability of the 2-D elastic plate PDE under the proposed boundary control is established with a designer-tunable decay rate.

However, these models are often confounded and difficult to validate in vivo. A model is misspecified when the assumed signal model differs from the true data-generating process. Under misspecification, the variance of any unbiased estimator is lower-bounded by the misspecified Cramer-Rao bound (MCRB), and maximum-likelihood estimates (MLE) may exhibit bias and inconsistency. Based on these principles, we assess misspecification in qMRI using two tests: (i) examining whether empirical MCRB asymptotically approaches the CRB as repeated measurements increase; (ii) comparing MLE estimates from two equal-sized subsets and evaluating whether their empirical variance aligns with theoretical CRB predictions. We demonstrate the framework using arterial spin labeling (ASL) as an illustrative example. Our result shows the commonly used ASL signal model appears to be specified in the brain and moderately misspecified in the kidney.

Key results include: orders of magnitude fewer parameters ($200\\times$ vs. Transformers); interpretable attention decomposing into proximity and orientational components; zero-shot scale generalization (99.3% MCC on topology vs. 50.4% for ViT); and $O(L)$ linear complexity via the novel Recursive Rotor Accumulator. In out-of-distribution tests, Versor maintains stable predictions while Transformers fail catastrophically. Custom Clifford kernels achieve up to $78\\times$ speedup, providing a scalable foundation for geometrically-aware scientific modeling.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although PLDES offers high fidelity and generality, its slow performance has plagued networking practitioners. Existing optimization techniques either simplify the network model, resulting in large errors; or execute it in parallel using multiple processors, with an upper bound on speedup. This paper explores an alternative optimization direction that reduces the computational loads of PLDES while maintaining high fidelity. Our key insight is that, in distributed LLM training, packet-level traffic behaviors often exhibit repetitive contention patterns and steady-states where flow rates stabilize, ignoring these redundant discrete events speeds up the simulation considerably and the error is negligible. We realize this idea by proposing Wormhole, a user-transparent PLDES kernel capable of automatically memoization for unsteady-states and skipping for steady-states. Wormhole adopts network partitioning, state memoization and reuse, and rate-based steady-state identification to accurately determine the periods of each flow's steady-state, while maintaining simulation consistency after fast-forwarding. Experiments demonstrate that Wormhole can achieve a 744x speedup over the original ns-3 (510x for MoE workload), with a bounded error of <1%. Applying current multithreading parallel techniques and Wormhole together allows a 1012x speedup, reducing the simulation time for one GPT-13B training under 128 GPUs from 9 hours to 5 minutes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper presents a dual-loop architecture that combines an inner-loop non-minimum-phase resonant controller (NRC) for active damping with an outer-loop tracking controller augmented by a constant-gain, lead-in-phase (CgLp) reset element to provide phase lead at the targeted crossover without increasing loop gain. We show that aggressively tuned CgLp designs with larger phase lead can introduce pronounced higher-order harmonics, degrading error sensitivity in specific frequency bands and causing multiple-reset behavior. To address this, a shaping filter is introduced in the reset-trigger path to regulate the reset action and suppress harmonic-induced effects while preserving the desired crossover-phase recovery. The proposed controllers are implemented in real time on an industrial piezo nanopositioner, demonstrating an experimental open-loop crossover increase of approximately 55~Hz and a closed-loop bandwidth improvement of about 34~Hz relative to a well-tuned linear baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This challenge is relevant for traumatic bowel injury, a rare but high-mortality diagnosis. We investigated whether specificity deficits in foundation models are associated with heterogeneity in the negative class. Methods: This retrospective study used the multi-institutional, RSNA Abdominal Traumatic Injury CT dataset (2019-2023), comprising scans from 23 centres. Two foundation models (MedCLIP, zero-shot; RadDINO, linear probe) were compared against three task-specific approaches (CNN, Transformer, Ensemble). Models were trained on 3,147 patients (2.3% bowel injury prevalence) and evaluated on an enriched 100-patient test set. To isolate negative-class effects, specificity was assessed in patients without bowel injury who had concurrent solid organ injury (n=58) versus no abdominal pathology (n=50). Results: Foundation models achieved equivalent discrimination to task-specific models (AUC, 0.64-0.68 versus 0.58-0.64) with higher sensitivity (79-91% vs 41-74%) but lower specificity (33-50% vs 50-88%). All models demonstrated high specificity in patients without abdominal pathology (84-100%). When solid organ injuries were present, specificity declined substantially for foundation models (50-51 percentage points) compared with smaller reductions of 12-41 percentage points for task-specific models. Conclusion: Foundation models matched task-specific discrimination without task-specific training, but their specificity deficits were driven primarily by confounding negative-class heterogeneity rather than prevalence alone. Susceptibility to negative-class heterogeneity decreased progressively with labelled training, suggesting adaptation is required before clinical implementation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We prove that this decoupling yields strictly smaller one-step conditional update variance than momentum-then-normalize variance methods under standard noise assumptions, and that MVN-Grad is robust to outliers: it has a uniformly bounded response to single gradient spikes.\n  In low-variance regimes, we further show variance normalization avoids sign-type collapse associated with second-moment scaling and can yield accelerated convergence.

To improve robustness without redesigning the CACC law, we explicitly model the mismatch between the ideal closed-loop dynamics assumed by the CACC design and the actual dynamics under parametric uncertainties. Robustness is formulated as an $\\mathcal{L}_2$ trajectory-matching problem, minimizing the energy of this mismatch to make the uncertain system behave as closely as possible to the ideal model. This objective is addressed by optimizing over plant equivalent controller (PEC) realizations that preserve the nominal closed-loop behavior while mitigating the effects of parametric uncertainty.

In this work, we conduct a closed-loop evaluation of state-of-the-art autonomous driving agents under black-box adversarial threat models in CARLA. Specifically, we consider three representative attack vectors on the visual perception pipeline: (i) a physics-based blur attack induced by acoustic waves, (ii) an electromagnetic interference attack that distorts captured images, and (iii) a digital attack that adds ghost objects as carefully crafted bounded perturbations on images. Our experiments on two advanced agents, Transfuser and Interfuser, reveal severe vulnerabilities to such attacks, with driving scores dropping by up to 99% in the worst case, raising valid safety concerns. To help mitigate such threats, we further propose a lightweight Attack Detection model for Autonomous Driving systems (AD$^2$) based on attention mechanisms that capture spatial-temporal consistency.

Recent work introduces dynamic vocabulary by sampling retrieved text spans but overlooks that the same sentence can be composed of spans of varying lengths, lacking explicit modeling of the directed acyclic graph (DAG) state space. This leads to restricted exploration of compositional paths and is biased toward the chosen path. Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are powerful for efficient exploring and generalizing over state spaces, particularly those with a DAG structure. However, prior GFlowNets-based language models operate at the token level and remain confined to tree-structured spaces, limiting their potential. In this work, we propose Flow of SpanS (FOSS), a principled GFlowNets framework for span generation. FoSS constructs a dynamic span vocabulary by segmenting the retrieved text flexibly, ensuring a DAG-structured state space, which allows GFlowNets to explore diverse compositional paths and improve generalization. With specialized reward models, FoSS generates diverse, high-quality text. Empirically, FoSS improves MAUVE scores by up to 12.5% over Transformer on text generation and achieves 3.5% gains on knowledge-intensive tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Scaling experiments further demonstrate FoSS benefits from larger models, more data, and richer retrieval corpora, retaining its advantage over strong baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Unlike the bulk of emerging techniques, focused on automatic solutions or high-level editing, we introduce an interactive suite of tools centered around versatile Gaussian Splat selection and segmentation. We propose a fast AI-driven method to propagate user-guided 2D selection masks to 3DGS selections. This technique allows for user intervention in the case of errors and is further coupled with flexible manual selection and segmentation tools. These allow a user to achieve virtually any binary segmentation of an unstructured 3DGS scene. We evaluate our toolset against the state-of-the-art for Gaussian Splat selection and demonstrate their utility for downstream applications by developing a user-guided local editing approach, leveraging a custom Video Diffusion Model.

In our experiments, the proposed hardware implementation achieves a compression ratio of 512x compared with conventional histogram-based outputs, with the potential for further improvement. The algorithm is first optimized in software using fixed-point (FXP) arithmetic and look-up tables (LUTs) to eliminate explicit additions, multiplications, and non-linear operations. This enables a careful balance between accuracy and hardware resource utilization. Guided by this trade-off analysis, online sketch processing elements (SPEs) are implemented on an FPGA to directly process time-stamp streams from the SPAD sensor. The implementation is validated using a customized LiDAR setup with a 192 x 128-pixel SPAD array.

Augmenting LLMs with hybrid external knowledge, such as unstructured text and structured knowledge graphs, offers a promising alternative to costly continual pretraining. As such, reliable evaluation of their retrieval and reasoning capabilities becomes critical. However, many existing benchmarks increasingly overlap with LLM pretraining data, which means answers or supporting knowledge may already be encoded in model parameters, making it difficult to distinguish genuine retrieval and reasoning from parametric recall. We introduce HybridRAG-Bench, a framework for constructing benchmarks to evaluate retrieval-intensive, multi-hop reasoning over hybrid knowledge. HybridRAG-Bench automatically couples unstructured text and structured knowledge graph representations derived from recent scientific literature on arXiv, and generates knowledge-intensive question-answer pairs grounded in explicit reasoning paths. The framework supports flexible domain and time-frame selection, enabling contamination-aware and customizable evaluation as models and knowledge evolve.

Large-scale training and inference increasingly depend on tightly coupled data centers, high-capacity optical networks, and energy systems operating close to physical and environmental limits. As a result, control over data and algorithms alone is no longer sufficient to achieve meaningful AI sovereignty. Practical sovereignty now depends on who can deploy, operate, and adapt AI infrastructure under constraints imposed by energy availability, sustainability targets, and network reach. This tutorial-survey introduces the concept of AI infrastructure sovereignty, defined as the ability of a region, operator, or nation to exercise operational control over AI systems within physical and environmental limits. The paper argues that sovereignty emerges from the co-design of three layers: AI-oriented data centers, optical transport networks, and automation frameworks that provide real-time visibility and control. We analyze how AI workloads reshape data center design, driving extreme power densities, advanced cooling requirements, and tighter coupling to local energy systems, with sustainability metrics such as carbon intensity and water usage acting as hard deployment boundaries. We then examine optical networks as the backbone of distributed AI, showing how latency, capacity, failure domains, and jurisdictional control define practical sovereignty limits. Building on this foundation, the paper positions telemetry, agentic AI, and digital twins as enablers of operational sovereignty through validated, closed-loop control across compute, network, and energy domains. The tutorial concludes with a reference architecture for sovereign AI infrastructure that integrates telemetry pipelines, agent-based control, and digital twins, framing sustainability as a first-order design constraint.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A representative example of this class has recently been employed in the power electronics literature to implement a grid-forming controller. We show that, under certain conditions, these port-Hamiltonian systems, when interconnected with passive systems, converge to a prescribed non-equilibrium steady state. At first glance, the apparently passive nature of the port-Hamiltonian system seems incompatible with the active power injection required to sustain this non-equilibrium condition. However, we demonstrate that the discontinuity inherent in the vector field provides the additional energy needed to maintain this operating point, indicating that the system is not globally passive. Moreover, when the discontinuity is replaced by a continuous approximation, the resulting system becomes cyclo-dissipative while still capable of supplying the required power.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While this paradigm greatly expands usability, it also introduces a critical and underexplored safety risk: the attack surface itself becomes visual. In this work, we propose Vision-Centric Jailbreak Attack (VJA), the first visual-to-visual jailbreak attack that conveys malicious instructions purely through visual inputs. To systematically study this emerging threat, we introduce IESBench, a safety-oriented benchmark for image editing models. Extensive experiments on IESBench demonstrate that VJA effectively compromises state-of-the-art commercial models, achieving attack success rates of up to 80.9% on Nano Banana Pro and 70.1% on GPT-Image-1.5. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose a training-free defense based on introspective multimodal reasoning, which substantially improves the safety of poorly aligned models to a level comparable with commercial systems, without auxiliary guard models and with negligible computational overhead. Our findings expose new vulnerabilities, provide both a benchmark and practical defense to advance safe and trustworthy modern image editing systems.

Most deployed encoders rely on task-agnostic downsampling and linear brightness-to-amplitude mappings, which are suboptimal under realistic perceptual models. While global inverse problems have been formulated as neural networks, such approaches can be fast at inference, and can achieve high reconstruction fidelity, but require training and have limited generalizability to arbitrary inputs. We cast stimulus encoding as a constrained sparse least-squares problem under a linearized perceptual forward model. Our key observation is that the resulting perception matrix can be highly sparse, depending on patient and implant configuration. Building on this, we apply an efficient projected residual norm steepest descent solver that exploits sparsity and supports stimulus bounds via projection.

Although recent progress in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) has boosted step-by-step inference in mathematics and coding, it is still underexplored whether this benefit transfers to socio-cognitive skills. We present a systematic study of nine advanced Large Language Models (LLMs), comparing reasoning models with non-reasoning models on three representative ToM benchmarks. The results show that reasoning models do not consistently outperform non-reasoning models and sometimes perform worse. A fine-grained analysis reveals three insights. First, slow thinking collapses: accuracy significantly drops as responses grow longer, and larger reasoning budgets hurt performance. Second, moderate and adaptive reasoning benefits performance: constraining reasoning length mitigates failure, while distinct success patterns demonstrate the necessity of dynamic adaptation. Third, option matching shortcut: when multiple choice options are removed, reasoning models improve markedly, indicating reliance on option matching rather than genuine deduction.

In this sense, any network links might fail. Besides, a signal can only travel a maximum distance before its quality falls below a certain threshold, necessitating its regeneration by regenerators installed at network nodes. In addition, the price of installing and maintaining regenerators belongs to a discrete uncertainty set. Robust optimization seeks a solution with guaranteed performance against all scenarios modeled in an uncertainty set. Thus, the problem is to find a subset of nodes with minimum cost for the placement of the regenerator, ensuring that all nodes can communicate even if a subset of network links fails. To solve the problem optimally, we propose two solution approaches, including one flow-based and one cut-based integer programming formulation, as well as their iterative exact method.

Most available methods either exploit particular symmetries of the PDE or address problems posed on parallelepiped domains. To the best of our knowledge, the only approach that enables the design of backstepping controllers on non-parallelepiped regions without symmetry assumptions is the domain extension technique. This method, however, presents several drawbacks. In particular, the control input at each time instant is obtained by simulating a PDE on an extended domain, from which the actual input on the original domain is approximated. By contrast, in the one-dimensional setting, once the time-independent backstepping gain kernel is known, the control input can be computed in closed form as a feedback depending solely on the state at that same instant. Moreover, problems such as output-feedback design or adaptive and robust control do not appear straightforward to address with the domain extension method, at least to the best of our knowledge. These considerations motivate the search, whenever possible, for alternatives that preserve the main advantages of one-dimensional backstepping. A motivating example for the domain extension method is the control of the heat equation on a piano-shaped domain, with actuation applied at the tail of the piano. In this extended abstract, we show through a simple calculation that the domain extension method is not required in this setting. Instead, a strategy akin to that used for parallelepiped domains can be adopted. This result constitutes a first instance of a broader framework for backstepping control of asymmetric PDEs posed on non-parallelepiped regions, which we refer to as domains with graph-monotone boundaries. The general framework is developed in a forthcoming paper.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although useful, task-specific modeling often increases training costs and limits generalization across behavioral settings. Recent reasoning RL methods facilitate training a single unified model across multiple behavioral tasks, but do not explicitly address learning across different heterogeneous behavioral data. To address this gap, we introduce Heterogeneity-Aware Relative Policy Optimization (HARPO), an RL method that balances leaning across heterogeneous tasks and samples. This is achieved by modulating advantages to ensure that no single task or sample carries disproportionate influence during policy optimization. Using HARPO, we develop and release Omnisapiens-7B 2.0, a foundation model for social behavior processing. Relative to existing behavioral foundation models, Omnisapiens-7B 2.0 achieves the strongest performance across behavioral tasks, with gains of up to +16.85% and +9.37% on multitask and held-out settings respectively, while producing more explicit and robust reasoning traces.

Our approach yields three key contributions: (1) it isolates interpretable, steerable directions for precise, fine-grained control over a single concept; (2) it effectively mitigates mode collapse in distilled models by reintroducing lost diversity; and (3) it establishes a novel estimator for concept complexity under a specific model, based on the dimensionality of the discovered subspace.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u5165\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u89e3\u8026\u8bed\u4e49\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u540c\u4e00\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u968f\u673a\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u6765\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u7ec6\u6982\u5ff5\u8c03\u8282\u3001\u7f13\u89e3\u6a21\u5f0f\u584c\u9677\u5e76\u4f30\u8ba1\u6982\u5ff5\u590d\u6742\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5355\u4e00\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u6027\u751f\u6210\u591a\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u63a7\u5236\u5177\u4f53\u8bed\u4e49\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5206\u6790\u8f93\u51fa\u7279\u5f81\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b", "method": "\u6536\u96c6\u56fa\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u4e0d\u540c\u968f\u673a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e4b\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u5206\u6790\u6216\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5728\u8f93\u5165\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f4\u63a5\u89e3\u8026\u8bed\u4e49\u65b9\u5411", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u7528\u4e8e\u5355\u4e2a\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u7cbe\u7ec6\u8c03\u8282\uff1b\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u84b8\u998f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u56e0\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e27\u5931\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u584c\u9677\uff1b\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u590d\u6742\u6027\u65b0\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u63a7\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u6982\u5ff5\u8c03\u63a7\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u6062\u590d\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5e76\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u590d\u6742\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u63a7\u751f\u6210\u5f00\u8f9f\u65b0\u9014\u5f84"}}

The accuracy of registration data directly impacts Internet operation, management, security, and optimization. In addition, the scarcity of IP addresses has brought into focus conflicts between RIR policy and IP registration ownership and use. The tension between a free-market based approach to address allocation versus policies to promote fairness and regional equity has resulted in court litigation that threatens the very existence of the RIR system.\n  We develop WHEREIS, a measurement-based approach to geolocate delegated IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes at an RIR-region granularity and systematically study where addresses are used post-allocation and the extent to which registration information is accurate. We define a taxonomy of registration ``geo-consistency'' that compares a prefix's measured geolocation to the allocating RIR's coverage region as well as the registered organization's location. While in aggregate over 98% of the prefixes we examine are consistent with our geolocation inferences, there is substantial variation across RIRs and we focus on AFRINIC as a case study. IPv6 registrations are no more consistent than IPv4, suggesting that structural, rather than technical, issues play an important role in allocations. We solicit additional information on inconsistent prefixes from network operators, IP leasing providers, and collaborate with three RIRs to obtain validation. We further show that the inconsistencies we discover manifest in three commercial geolocation databases. By improving the transparency around post-allocation prefix use, we hope to improve applications that use IP registration data and inform ongoing discussions over in-region address use and policy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce XSPLAIN, the first ante-hoc, prototype-based interpretability framework designed specifically for 3DGS classification. Our approach leverages a voxel-aggregated PointNet backbone and a novel, invertible orthogonal transformation that disentangles feature channels for interpretability while strictly preserving the original decision boundaries.

A rigorous user study (N=51) demonstrates a decisive preference for our approach: participants selected XSPLAIN explanations 48.4\\% of the time as the best, significantly outperforming baselines $(p<0.001)$, showing that XSPLAIN provides transparency and user trust.

However, fine-tuning these models with Reinforcement Learning (RL) often suffers from a fundamental probability-reward mismatch. Conventional likelihood-dominated decoding (e.g., beam search) exhibits a myopic bias toward locally probable prefixes, which causes two critical failures: (1) insufficient exploration, where high-reward items in low-probability branches are prematurely pruned and rarely sampled, and (2) advantage compression, where trajectories sharing high-probability prefixes receive highly correlated rewards with low within-group variance, yielding a weak comparative signal for RL. To address these challenges, we propose V-STAR, a Value-guided Sampling and Tree-structured Advantage Reinforcement framework. V-STAR forms a self-evolving loop via two synergistic components. First, a Value-Guided Efficient Decoding (VED) is developed to identify decisive nodes and selectively deepen high-potential prefixes. This improves exploration efficiency without exhaustive tree search. Second, we propose Sibling-GRPO, which exploits the induced tree topology to compute sibling-relative advantages and concentrates learning signals on decisive branching decisions. Extensive experiments on both offline and online datasets demonstrate that V-STAR outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, delivering superior accuracy and candidate-set diversity under strict latency constraints.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this, we introduce Temper-Then-Tilt Unlearning (T3-Unlearning), which freezes the base model and applies a two-step inference procedure: (i) tempering the base distribution to flatten high-confidence spikes, and (ii) tilting the tempered distribution using a lightweight classifier trained to distinguish retain from forget samples. Our theoretical analysis provides finite-sample guarantees linking the surrogate classifier's risk to unlearning error, proving that tempering is necessary to successfully unlearn for concentrated distributions.

In addition, the EU AI Act requires universities to ensure regulatory compliance when deploying cognitive systems. These developments highlight the need for institutions to engage stakeholders and tailor GenAI integration to their needs while addressing concerns. This study investigates how GenAI is perceived within the disciplines of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering (ITEE). Using a mixed-method approach, we surveyed 61 staff and 37 students at the Faculty of ITEE, University of Oulu. The results reveal both shared and discipline-specific themes, including strong interest in programming support from GenAI and concerns over response quality, privacy, and academic integrity. Drawing from these insights, the study identifies a set of high-level requirements and proposes a conceptual framework for responsible GenAI integration.

Despite its efficacy, RLVR faces a meta-learning bottleneck: it lacks mechanisms for error attribution and experience internalization intrinsic to the human learning cycle beyond practice and verification, thereby limiting fine-grained credit assignment and reusable knowledge formation. We term such reusable knowledge representations derived from past errors as meta-experience. Based on this insight, we propose Meta-Experience Learning (MEL), a novel framework that incorporates self-distilled meta-experience into the model's parametric memory. Building upon standard RLVR, we introduce an additional design that leverages the LLM's self-verification capability to conduct contrastive analysis on paired correct and incorrect trajectories, identify the precise bifurcation points where reasoning errors arise, and summarize them into generalizable meta-experience. The meta-experience is further internalized into the LLM's parametric memory by minimizing the negative log-likelihood, which induces a language-modeled reward signal that bridges correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories and facilitates effective knowledge reuse.

While state-of-the-art generative models can synthesize auxiliary views to provide additional supervision, these views inevitably contain geometric inconsistencies and textural misalignments that propagate and amplify artifacts during 3D reconstruction. To effectively harness these imperfect supervisory signals, we propose an adaptive optimization framework guided by excess risk decomposition, termed ERGO. Specifically, ERGO decomposes the optimization losses in 3D Gaussian splatting into two components, i.e., excess risk that quantifies the suboptimality gap between current and optimal parameters, and Bayes error that models the irreducible noise inherent in synthesized views. This decomposition enables ERGO to dynamically estimate the view-specific excess risk and adaptively adjust loss weights during optimization. Furthermore, we introduce geometry-aware and texture-aware objectives that complement the excess-risk-derived weighting mechanism, establishing a synergistic global-local optimization paradigm. Consequently, ERGO demonstrates robustness against supervision noise while consistently enhancing both geometric fidelity and textural quality of the reconstructed 3D content. Extensive experiments on the Google Scanned Objects dataset and the OmniObject3D dataset demonstrate the superiority of ERGO over existing state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The standard approach, where we generate timestamps as sequences of text tokens, is computationally expensive and prone to hallucination, especially when processing audio lengths outside the model's training distribution. In this work, we propose frame-level internal tool use, a method that trains audio LMs to use their own internal audio representations to perform temporal grounding directly. We introduce a lightweight prediction mechanism trained via two objectives: a binary frame classifier and a novel inhomogeneous Poisson process (IHP) loss that models temporal event intensity. Across word localization, speaker diarization, and event localization tasks, our approach outperforms token-based baselines.

In this work, we compare the efficacy of deploying CBCP and DBCP in reducing user costs and increasing toll revenues.

We establish that, in our formulation, Nash equilibrium flows always exist and can be computed or well approximated via convex programming. Our main result establishes a set of practically relevant conditions under which DBCP provably outperforms CBCP in inducing equilibrium outcomes that minimize a given societal cost, which encodes user cost reduction and toll revenue maximization.

While these models demonstrate impressive fluency and generative capacity, prior work has shown that they also exhibit systematic cultural biases, raising concerns about stereotyping, homogenization, and the erasure of culturally specific forms of expression. Understanding whether LLMs can meaningfully align with diverse cultures beyond the dominant ones remains a critical challenge. In this paper, we study cultural adaptation in LLMs through the lens of cooking recipes, a domain in which culture, tradition, and creativity are tightly intertwined. We build on the \\textit{GlobalFusion} dataset, which pairs human recipes from different countries according to established measures of cultural distance. Using the same country pairs, we generate culturally adapted recipes with multiple LLMs, enabling a direct comparison between human and LLM behavior in cross-cultural content creation. Our analysis shows that LLMs fail to produce culturally representative adaptations. Unlike humans, the divergence of their generated recipes does not correlate with cultural distance. We further provide explanations for this gap. We show that cultural information is weakly preserved in internal model representations, that models inflate novelty in their production by misunderstanding notions such as creativity and tradition, and that they fail to identify adaptation with its associated countries and to ground it in culturally salient elements such as ingredients. These findings highlight fundamental limitations of current LLMs for culturally oriented generation and have important implications for their use in culturally sensitive applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

For structured generations with explicit segments and objectives, this couples unrelated reward signals across segments, leading to objective interference and misattributed credit. We propose Blockwise Advantage Estimation, a family of GRPO-compatible methods that assigns each objective its own advantage and applies it only to the tokens in the corresponding text block, reducing reliance on hand-designed scalar rewards and scaling naturally to additional objectives. A key challenge is estimating advantages for later blocks whose rewards are conditioned on sampled prefixes; standard unbiased approaches require expensive nested rollouts from intermediate states.

UAVs equipped with gimballed electro-optical sensors are typically used to localize targets, however, reliance on these sensors increases mechanical complexity, cost, and susceptibility to single-point failures, limiting scalability and robustness in multi-UAV operations. This work presents a new trajectory optimization framework that enables cooperative target localization using UAVs with fixed, non-gimballed cameras operating in coordination with a surface vessel. This estimation-aware optimization generates dynamically feasible trajectories that explicitly account for mission constraints, platform dynamics, and out-of-frame events. Estimation-aware trajectories outperform heuristic paths by reducing localization error by more than a factor of two, motivating their use in cooperative operations. Results further demonstrate that coordinated UAVs with fixed, non-gimballed cameras achieve localization accuracy that meets or exceeds that of single gimballed systems, while substantially lowering system complexity and cost, enabling scalability, and enhancing mission resilience.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A patient with a rare disease combination or a transaction with unusual characteristics stands out from the crowd. Differential privacy provides worst-case guarantees, but empirical attacks -- particularly membership inference -- succeed far more often against such outliers, especially under moderate privacy budgets and with auxiliary information.\n  This paper introduces risk-equalized DP synthesis, a framework that prioritizes protection for high-risk records by reducing their influence on the learned generator. The mechanism operates in two stages: first, a small privacy budget estimates each record's \"outlierness\"; second, a DP learning procedure weights each record inversely to its risk score. Under Gaussian mechanisms, a record's privacy loss is proportional to its influence on the output -- so deliberately shrinking outliers' contributions yields tighter per-instance privacy bounds for precisely those records that need them most.\n  We prove end-to-end DP guarantees via composition and derive closed-form per-record bounds for the synthesis stage (the scoring stage adds a uniform per-record term). Experiments on simulated data with controlled outlier injection show that risk-weighting substantially reduces membership inference success against high-outlierness records; ablations confirm that targeting -- not random downweighting -- drives the improvement. On real-world benchmarks (Breast Cancer, Adult, German Credit), gains are dataset-dependent, highlighting the interplay between scorer quality and synthesis pipeline.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) provides a principled framework for speckle mitigation, its application to coherent imaging system such as digital holography with finite apertures is hindered by the prohibitive cost of high-dimensional matrix inversion, especially at high resolutions. This computational burden has prevented the use of MLE-based reconstruction with physically accurate aperture modeling. In this work, we propose a randomized linear algebra approach that enables scalable MLE optimization without explicit matrix inversions in gradient computation. By exploiting the structural properties of sensing matrix and using conjugate gradient for likelihood gradient evaluation, the proposed algorithm supports accurate aperture modeling without the simplifying assumptions commonly imposed for tractability. We term the resulting method projected gradient descent with Monte Carlo estimation (PGD-MC). The proposed PGD-MC framework (i) demonstrates robustness to diverse and physically accurate aperture models, (ii) achieves substantial improvements in reconstruction quality and computational efficiency, and (iii) scales effectively to high-resolution digital holography. Extensive experiments incorporating three representative denoisers as regularization show that PGD-MC provides a flexible and effective MLE-based reconstruction framework for digital holography with finite apertures, consistently outperforming prior Plug-and-Play model-based iterative reconstruction methods in both accuracy and speed.

A key challenge is the scarcity of evaluation testbeds that combine the complexity of software development with the need for deep multimodal understanding. Game development provides such a testbed as agents must navigate large, dense codebases while manipulating intrinsically multimodal assets such as shaders, sprites, and animations within a visual game scene. We present GameDevBench, the first benchmark for evaluating agents on game development tasks. GameDevBench consists of 132 tasks derived from web and video tutorials. Tasks require significant multimodal understanding and are complex -- the average solution requires over three times the amount of lines of code and file changes compared to prior software development benchmarks. Agents still struggle with game development, with the best agent solving only 54.5% of tasks. We find a strong correlation between perceived task difficulty and multimodal complexity, with success rates dropping from 46.9% on gameplay-oriented tasks to 31.6% on 2D graphics tasks. To improve multimodal capability, we introduce two simple image and video-based feedback mechanisms for agents. Despite their simplicity, these methods consistently improve performance, with the largest change being an increase in Claude Sonnet 4.5's performance from 33.3% to 47.7%.

This paradigm of opportunistic imaging adds value to medical imaging without additional imaging costs or patient radiation exposure. However, many open-source image analysis solutions lack rigorous validation while commercial solutions lack transparency, leading to unexpected failures when deployed. Here, we report development and validation for two of the first fully open-sourced, FDA-510(k)-cleared deep learning pipelines to mitigate both challenges: Abdominal Aortic Quantification (AAQ) and Bone Mineral Density (BMD) estimation are both offered within the Comp2Comp package for opportunistic analysis of computed tomography scans. AAQ segments the abdominal aorta to assess aneurysm size; BMD segments vertebral bodies to estimate trabecular bone density and osteoporosis risk. AAQ-derived maximal aortic diameters were compared against radiologist ground-truth measurements on 258 patient scans enriched for abdominal aortic aneurysms from four external institutions. BMD binary classifications (low vs. normal bone density) were compared against concurrent DXA scan ground truths obtained on 371 patient scans from four external institutions. AAQ had an overall mean absolute error of 1.57 mm (95% CI 1.38-1.80 mm). BMD had a sensitivity of 81.0% (95% CI 74.0-86.8%) and specificity of 78.4% (95% CI 72.3-83.7%). Comp2Comp AAQ and BMD demonstrated sufficient accuracy for clinical use. Open-sourcing these algorithms improves transparency of typically opaque FDA clearance processes, allows hospitals to test the algorithms before cumbersome clinical pilots, and provides researchers with best-in-class methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, single kernel approaches are inherently limited, as they rely on a single type of kernel function (e.g., Gaussian kernel), which may be insufficient to fully represent the heterogeneity or multifaceted nature of real-world data. Multiple kernel learning (MKL) addresses these limitations by constructing composite kernels from simpler ones and integrating information from heterogeneous sources. Despite these advances, traditional MKL methods are primarily designed for continuous outcomes. We extend MKL to accommodate the outcome variable belonging to the exponential family, representing a broader variety of data types, and refer to our proposed method as generalized linear models with integrated multiple additive regression with kernels (GLIMARK). Empirically, we demonstrate that GLIMARK can effectively recover or approximate the true data-generating mechanism.

Despite recent progress, existing hallucination mitigation methods often overlook the underlying hallucination patterns driven by language bias. In this work, we design a novel pipeline to accurately synthesize Hallucination-Inducing Images (HIIs). Using synthesized HIIs, we reveal a consistent scene-conditioned hallucination pattern: models tend to mention objects that are highly typical of the scene even when visual evidence is removed. To quantify the susceptibility of VLMs to this hallucination pattern, we establish the Masked-Object-Hallucination (MOH) benchmark to rigorously evaluate existing state-of-the-art alignment frameworks. Finally, we leverage HIIs to construct high-quality preference datasets for fine-grained alignment.

A practical alternative to reduce computational and memory overhead is to perform BPTT repeatedly over shorter segments of the training data set, corresponding to truncated BPTT. In this paper, we examine the training of RNNs when using such a truncated learning approach for time series tasks. Specifically, we establish theoretical bounds on the accuracy and performance loss when optimizing over subsequences instead of the full data sequence.

We validate our theoretical results through experiments on standard benchmarks from the fields of system identification and time series forecasting.

However, achieving real-time DNN inference in the AV's perception pipeline is challenging due to the large gap between the computation requirement and the AV's limited resources. Most, if not all, of existing studies focus on optimizing the DNN inference time to achieve faster perception by compressing the DNN model with pruning and quantization. In contrast, we present a Predictable Perception system with DNNs (PP-DNN) that reduce the amount of image data to be processed while maintaining the same level of accuracy for multi-tenant DNNs by dynamically selecting critical frames and regions of interest (ROIs). PP-DNN is based on our key insight that critical frames and ROIs for AVs vary with the AV's surrounding environment. However, it is challenging to identify and use critical frames and ROIs in multi-tenant DNNs for predictable inference. Given image-frame streams, PP-DNN leverages an ROI generator to identify critical frames and ROIs based on the similarities of consecutive frames and traffic scenarios. PP-DNN then leverages a FLOPs predictor to predict multiply-accumulate operations (MACs) from the dynamic critical frames and ROIs. The ROI scheduler coordinates the processing of critical frames and ROIs with multiple DNN models. Finally, we design a detection predictor for the perception of non-critical frames. We have implemented PP-DNN in an ROS-based AV pipeline and evaluated it with the BDD100K and the nuScenes dataset. PP-DNN is observed to significantly enhance perception predictability, increasing the number of fusion frames by up to 7.3x, reducing the fusion delay by >2.6x and fusion-delay variations by >2.3x, improving detection completeness by 75.4% and the cost-effectiveness by up to 98% over the baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "PP-DNN\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u548c\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11AV\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u591a\u79df\u6237DNN\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f66\u8f86\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6709\u9650\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6DNN\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027", "method": "PP-DNN\u5229\u7528ROI\u751f\u6210\u5668\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u548cROI\uff0cFLOPs\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\uff0cROI\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\u534f\u8c03\u591aDNN\u6a21\u578b\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u9884\u6d4b\u5668\u5904\u7406\u975e\u5173\u952e\u5e27", "result": "\u5728ROS-based AV pipeline\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528BDD100K\u548cnuScenes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u611f\u77e5\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\uff1a\u878d\u5408\u5e27\u6570\u63d0\u53477.3\u500d\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e>2.6\u500d\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5b8c\u5907\u6027\u63d0\u534775.4%", "conclusion": "PP-DNN\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u548cROI\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u591a\u79df\u6237DNN\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u56fe\u50cf\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u91cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd"}}

However, its spatial behavior lacks rigorous understanding from a physical systems perspective, leading to reliance on heuristics for hyperparameter selection. This work introduces a novel analytical approach that characterizes MHE by examining its Point Spread Function (PSF), which is analogous to the Green's function of the system. This methodology enables a quantification of the encoding's spatial resolution and fidelity. We derive a closed-form approximation for the collision-free PSF, uncovering inherent grid-induced anisotropy and a logarithmic spatial profile. We establish that the idealized spatial bandwidth, specifically the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM), is determined by the average resolution, $N_{\\text{avg}}$. This leads to a counterintuitive finding: the effective resolution of the model is governed by the broadened empirical FWHM (and therefore $N_{\\text{avg}}$), rather than the finest resolution $N_{\\max}$, a broadening effect we demonstrate arises from optimization dynamics. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of finite hash capacity, demonstrating how collisions introduce speckle noise and degrade the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). Leveraging these theoretical insights, we propose Rotated MHE (R-MHE), an architecture that applies distinct rotations to the input coordinates at each resolution level. R-MHE mitigates anisotropy while maintaining the efficiency and parameter count of the original MHE. This study establishes a methodology based on physical principles that moves beyond heuristics to characterize and optimize MHE.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Specifically, our method builds upon the recently proposed causal Bellman equation to learn a tight upper bound on the optimal state values, which is then used as the potentials in the Potential-Based Reward Shaping (PBRS) framework. Our proposed reward shaping algorithm is tested with Soft-Actor-Critic (SAC) on multiple commonly used continuous control benchmarks and exhibits strong performance guarantees under unobserved confounders. More broadly, our work marks a solid first step towards confounding robust continuous control from a causal perspective.

While delta-tuning has proven effective in boosting the performance and efficiency of LLMs during adaptation, its advantages cannot be directly transferred to the fine-tuning pipeline of vision foundation models. To push the boundaries of adaptation efficiency for vision tasks, we propose an adapter with Complex Linear Projection Optimization (CoLin). For architecture, we design a novel low-rank complex adapter that introduces only about 1% parameters to the backbone. For efficiency, we theoretically prove that low-rank composite matrices suffer from severe convergence issues during training, and address this challenge with a tailored loss. Extensive experiments on object detection, segmentation, image classification, and rotated object detection (remote sensing scenario) demonstrate that CoLin outperforms both full fine-tuning and classical delta-tuning approaches with merely 1% parameters for the first time, providing a novel and efficient solution for deployment of vision foundation models.

Building on an existing supervised tabular predictor, the framework constructs a reasoning-centric knowledge base composed of labeled tabular records, where each sample includes structured predictors, a compact natural language text-mode summary, and a model-generated reasoning trajectory. During inference, R2RAG-Flood issues context-augmented prompts that retrieve and condition on relevant reasoning trajectories from nearby geospatial neighbors and canonical class prototypes, enabling the large language model backbone to emulate and adapt prior reasoning rather than learn new task-specific parameters. Predictions follow a two-stage procedure that first determines property damage occurrence and then refines severity within a three-level Property Damage Extent categorization, with a conditional downgrade step to correct over-predicted severity. In a case study of Harris County, Texas at the 12-digit Hydrologic Unit Code scale, the supervised tabular baseline trained directly on structured predictors achieves 0.714 overall accuracy and 0.859 damage class accuracy for medium and high damage classes. Across seven large language model backbones, R2RAG-Flood attains 0.613 to 0.668 overall accuracy and 0.757 to 0.896 damage class accuracy, approaching the supervised baseline while additionally producing a structured rationale for each prediction. Using a severity-per-cost efficiency metric derived from API pricing and GPU instance costs, lightweight R2RAG-Flood variants demonstrate substantially higher efficiency than both the supervised tabular baseline and larger language models, while requiring no task-specific training or fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, achieving this remains challenging due to insufficient training data with limited subject identities, narrow audio representations, and restricted explicit controllability. In this paper, we propose 3DXTalker, an expressive 3D talking avatar through data-curated identity modeling, audio-rich representations, and spatial dynamics controllability. 3DXTalker enables scalable identity modeling via 2D-to-3D data curation pipeline and disentangled representations, alleviating data scarcity and improving identity generalization. Then, we introduce frame-wise amplitude and emotional cues beyond standard speech embeddings, ensuring superior lip synchronization and nuanced expression modulation. These cues are unified by a flow-matching-based transformer for coherent facial dynamics. Moreover, 3DXTalker also enables natural head-pose motion generation while supporting stylized control via prompt-based conditioning. Extensive experiments show that 3DXTalker integrates lip synchronization, emotional expression, and head-pose dynamics within a unified framework, achieves superior performance in 3D talking avatar generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa3DXTalker\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u97f3\u9891\u4e30\u5bcc\u8868\u793a\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u6765\u751f\u6210\u8868\u8fbe\u60273D\u8bf4\u8bdd\u5934\u50cf\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc72D\u52303D\u6570\u636e\u7b56\u5c55\u7f13\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u632f\u5e45\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u7ebf\u7d22\u63d0\u5347\u5507\u5f62\u540c\u6b65\u548c\u8868\u60c5\u8868\u8fbe\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684Transformer\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fde\u8d2f\u9762\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\u53ca\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u5934\u90e8\u59ff\u6001\u751f\u6210\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u57283D\u8bf4\u8bdd\u5934\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u8d8a\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u97f3\u9891\u9a71\u52a8\u76843D\u8bf4\u8bdd\u5934\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u5728\u865a\u62df\u901a\u4fe1\u3001\u6570\u5b57\u4eba\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5a92\u4f53\u4e2d\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8eab\u4efd\u6709\u9650\u3001\u97f3\u9891\u8868\u793a\u72ed\u7a84\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u3001\u5507\u5f62\u540c\u6b65\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e863DXTalker\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc72D\u52303D\u6570\u636e\u7b56\u5c55\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u5206\u79bb\u8868\u793a\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8eab\u4efd\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u5e27\u7ea7\u632f\u5e45\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u7ebf\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u97f3\u9891\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u5507\u5f62\u540c\u6b65\u548c\u8868\u60c5\u8c03\u5236\uff1b3\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u7684Transformer\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u9762\u90e8\u52a8\u6001\uff1b4\uff09\u652f\u6301\u57fa\u4e8e\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u5934\u90e8\u59ff\u6001\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c3DXTalker\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u96c6\u6210\u4e86\u5507\u5f62\u540c\u6b65\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u5934\u90e8\u59ff\u6001\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u57283D\u8bf4\u8bdd\u5934\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "3DXTalker\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u7b56\u5c55\u8eab\u4efd\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u4e30\u5bcc\u97f3\u9891\u8868\u793a\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8868\u8fbe\u60273D\u8bf4\u8bdd\u5934\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8eab\u4efd\u4fdd\u6301\u3001\u5507\u5f62\u540c\u6b65\u3001\u60c5\u611f\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u7a7a\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u865a\u62df\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u6570\u5b57\u4eba\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Reasoning over such knowledge requires models to integrate spatial relationships, visual cues, real-world context, and domain-specific expertise-capabilities that current large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle to exhibit consistently. Yet, datasets used to benchmark VLMs on map-based reasoning remain narrow in scope, restricted to specific domains, and heavily reliant on artificially generated content (outputs from LLMs or pipeline-based methods), offering limited depth for evaluating genuine geospatial reasoning. To address this gap, we present MapVerse, a large-scale benchmark built on real-world maps. It comprises 11,837 human-authored question-answer pairs across 1,025 maps, spanning ten diverse map categories and multiple question categories for each. The dataset provides a rich setting for evaluating map reading, interpretation, and multimodal reasoning.

In response, several datasets have been established to train detection models aimed at distinguishing AI-generated images from real ones. However, existing datasets suffer from limited generalization, low image quality, overly simple prompts, and insufficient image diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a high-quality, large-scale dataset comprising over 730,000 images across multiple categories, including both real and AI-generated images. The generated images are synthesized via state-of-the-art methods, including text-to-image generation (guided by over 10,000 carefully designed prompts), image inpainting, image refinement, and face swapping. Each generated image is annotated with its generation method and category. Inpainting images further include binary masks to indicate inpainted regions, providing rich metadata for analysis. Compared to existing datasets, detection models trained on our dataset demonstrate superior generalization capabilities. Our dataset not only serves as a strong benchmark for evaluating detection methods but also contributes to advancing the robustness of AI-generated image detection techniques. Building upon this, we propose a lightweight detection method based on image noise entropy, which transforms the original image into an entropy tensor of Non-Local Means (NLM) noise before classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained on our dataset achieve strong generalization, and our method delivers competitive performance, establishing a solid baseline for future research.

Such an imbalance can degrade representation quality and induce biased model behavior, yet a rigorous characterization of these effects is lacking. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze the training dynamics of contrastive learning with Transformer-based encoders under imbalanced data. Our results reveal that neuron weights evolve through three distinct stages of training, with different dynamics for majority features, minority features, and noise. We further show that minority features reduce representational capacity, increase the need for more complex architectures, and hinder the separation of ground-truth features from noise. Inspired by these neuron-level behaviors, we show that pruning restores performance degraded by imbalance and enhances feature separation, offering both conceptual insights and practical guidance.

Text provides explicit semantic information that can enhance anomaly characterization and reduce false alarms. However, extracting effective text features is challenging due to the inability of general-purpose language models to capture anomaly-specific nuances and the scarcity of relevant descriptions. Furthermore, multimodal fusion often suffers from redundancy and imbalance. To address these issues, we propose a novel text-guided framework.

However, the inherited Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) introduces limitations for multimodal processing. Specifically, applying 1D temporal positional indices disrupts the continuity of visual features along the column dimension, resulting in spatial locality loss. Moreover, RoPE follows the prior that temporally closer image tokens are more causally related, leading to long-term decay in attention allocation and causing the model to progressively neglect earlier visual tokens as the sequence length increases. To address these issues, we propose C^2RoPE, an improved RoPE that explicitly models local spatial Continuity and spatial Causal relationships for visual processing. C^2RoPE introduces a spatio-temporal continuous positional embedding mechanism for visual tokens. It first integrates 1D temporal positions with Cartesian-based spatial coordinates to construct a triplet hybrid positional index, and then employs a frequency allocation strategy to encode spatio-temporal positional information across the three index components. Additionally, we introduce Chebyshev Causal Masking, which determines causal dependencies by computing the Chebyshev distance of image tokens in 2D space. Evaluation results across various benchmarks, including 3D scene reasoning and 3D visual question answering, demonstrate C^2RoPE's effectiveness.

In these resource-constrained on-device settings, selecting an appropriate large language model (LLM) backbone is a critical challenge: models must balance accuracy with strict inference latency and hardware efficiency constraints. This makes hardware-software co-design a game-changing requirement for on-device LLM deployment, where each hardware platform demands a tailored architectural solution. We propose a hardware co-design law that jointly captures model accuracy and inference performance. Specifically, we model training loss as an explicit function of architectural hyperparameters and characterise inference latency via roofline modelling. We empirically evaluate 1,942 candidate architectures on NVIDIA Jetson Orin, training 170 selected models for 10B tokens each to fit a scaling law relating architecture to training loss. By coupling this scaling law with latency modelling, we establish a direct accuracy-latency correspondence and identify the Pareto frontier for hardware co-designed LLMs. We further formulate architecture search as a joint optimisation over precision and performance, deriving feasible design regions under industrial hardware and application budgets. Our approach reduces architecture selection from months to days. At the same latency as Qwen2.5-0.5B on the target hardware, our co-designed architecture achieves 19.42% lower perplexity on WikiText-2. To our knowledge, this is the first principled and operational framework for hardware co-design scaling laws in on-device LLM deployment.

This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of machine learning and deep learning methodologies for identifying malnutrition among children under five years of age in Nepal. We systematically compared 16 algorithms spanning deep learning, gradient boosting, and traditional machine learning families, using data from the Nepal Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey (MICS) 2019. A composite malnutrition indicator was constructed by integrating stunting, wasting, and underweight status, and model performance was evaluated using ten metrics, with emphasis on F1-score and recall to account for substantial class imbalance and the high cost of failing to detect malnourished children. Among all models, TabNet demonstrated the best performance, likely attributable to its attention-based architecture, and outperformed both support vector machine and AdaBoost classifiers. A consensus feature importance analysis identified maternal education, household wealth index, and child age as the primary predictors of malnutrition, followed by geographic characteristics, vaccination status, and meal frequency. Collectively, these results demonstrate a scalable, survey-based screening framework for identifying children at elevated risk of malnutrition and for guiding targeted nutritional interventions.

For example, while transformers capture rich associations, they are mostly agnostic to event timing and ordering, thereby bypassing potential causal reasoning.\n  Intuitively, we need a method capable of evaluating the \"degree of alignment\" among patient-specific trajectories and identifying their shared patterns, i.e., the significant events in a consistent sequence. This necessitates treating timing as a true \\emph{computable} dimension, allowing models to assign ``relative timestamps'' to candidate events beyond their observed physical times.\n  In this work, we introduce LITT, a novel Timing-Transformer architecture that enables temporary alignment of sequential events on a virtual ``relative timeline'', thereby enabling \\emph{event-timing-focused attention} and personalized interpretations of clinical trajectories. Its interpretability and effectiveness are validated on real-world longitudinal EHR data from 3,276 breast cancer patients to predict the onset timing of cardiotoxicity-induced heart disease.

We introduce a human-interpretable structural encoding strategy for graph-to-text translation that injects graph structure directly into natural language prompts. Our method involves computing a variant of Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) similarity classes and maps them to human-like color tokens rather than numeric labels. The key insight is that semantically meaningful and human-interpretable cues may be more effectively processed by LLMs than opaque symbolic encoding.

Can we posit large models as partial world models? We provide a formal answer to this question, proving that agents achieving task-agnostic, language-conditioned intents necessarily possess predictive partial-world models informed by affordances. In the multi-task setting, we introduce distribution-robust affordances and show that partial models can be extracted to significantly improve search efficiency. Empirical evaluations in tabletop robotics tasks demonstrate that our affordance-aware partial models reduce the search branching factor and achieve higher rewards compared to full world models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5426\u4f5c\u4e3a\u90e8\u5206\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5177\u5907\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u6761\u4ef6\u610f\u56fe\u7684Agent\u5fc5\u7136\u62e5\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u884c\u52a8\u6027\uff08affordances\uff09\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u90e8\u5206\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u884c\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u4e0a\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u6d77\u91cf\u4e92\u8054\u7f51\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u80fd\u5305\u542b\u4e86\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u4f46\u76f4\u63a5\u5c06\u5176\u7528\u4e8e\u641c\u7d22\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u4e14\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u3002\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u4e0b\uff0c\u90e8\u5206\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u610f\u56fe\u76f8\u5173\u8054\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b50\u96c6\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5426\u4f5c\u4e3a\u90e8\u5206\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "1) \u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4efb\u52a1\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u6761\u4ef6\u610f\u56fe\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5fc5\u7136\u62e5\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u884c\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u90e8\u5206\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u30022) \u5728\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u52a8\u6027\uff08distribution-robust affordances\uff09\u30023) \u63d0\u51fa\u4ece\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u90e8\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u30024) \u5728\u684c\u9762\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u884c\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6574\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u5206\u652f\u56e0\u5b50\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u884c\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\uff1a1) \u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u641c\u7d22\u5206\u652f\u56e0\u5b50\uff08\u5373\u51cf\u5c11\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff09\uff1b2) \u5728\u684c\u9762\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u6bd4\u4f7f\u7528\u5b8c\u6574\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u3002\u8fd9\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u90e8\u5206\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63d0\u9ad8\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u4f5c\u4e3a\u90e8\u5206\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u5176\u4e0e\u53ef\u884c\u52a8\u6027\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u884c\u52a8\u6027\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u7387\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u641c\u7d22\u5206\u652f\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u5927\u578b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

This limitation is especially pronounced in the medical imaging domain, where effective performance requires both robust visual perception and structured reasoning. In this work, we address this gap by proposing VRFT-Aug, a visual reinforcement fine-tuning framework tailored for the medical domain. VRFT-Aug introduces a series of training strategies designed to augment both perception and reasoning, including prior knowledge injection, perception-driven policy refinement, medically informed reward shaping, and behavioral imitation. Together, these methods aim to stabilize and improve the RFT process.\n  Through extensive experiments across multiple medical datasets, we show that our approaches consistently outperform both standard supervised fine-tuning and RFT baselines. Moreover, we provide empirically grounded insights and practical training heuristics that can be generalized to other medical image tasks.

As the set of design parameters grow, the search space grows exponentially, making the actual synthesis and evaluation of all material combinations virtually impossible. Even using traditional computational methods such as Finite Element Analysis becomes too computationally heavy to search the design space. Recent methods use machine learning (ML) surrogate models to more efficiently determine optimal material designs; unfortunately, these methods often (i) are notoriously difficult to interpret and (ii) under perform when the training data comes from a non-uniform sampling of the design space. We suggest the use of tensor completion methods as an all-in-one approach for interpretability and predictions. We observe classical tensor methods are able to compete with traditional ML in predictions, with the added benefit of their interpretable tensor factors (which are given completely for free, as a result of the prediction). In our experiments, we are able to rediscover physical phenomena via the tensor factors, indicating that our predictions are aligned with the true underlying physics of the problem. This also means these tensor factors could be used by experimentalists to identify potentially novel patterns, given we are able to rediscover existing ones. We also study the effects of both types of surrogate models when we encounter training data from a non-uniform sampling of the design space. We observe more specialized tensor methods that can give better generalization in these non-uniforms sampling scenarios. We find the best generalization comes from a tensor model, which is able to improve upon the baseline ML methods by up to 5% on aggregate $R^2$, and halve the error in some out of distribution regions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Here, we introduce DermFM-Zero, a dermatology vision-language foundation model trained via masked latent modelling and contrastive learning on over 4 million multimodal data points. We evaluated DermFM-Zero across 20 benchmarks spanning zero-shot diagnosis and multimodal retrieval, achieving state-of-the-art performance without task-specific adaptation. We further evaluated its zero-shot capabilities in three multinational reader studies involving over 1,100 clinicians. In primary care settings, AI assistance enabled general practitioners to nearly double their differential diagnostic accuracy across 98 skin conditions. In specialist settings, the model significantly outperformed board-certified dermatologists in multimodal skin cancer assessment.

Effective specialisation requires learning new reaction knowledge while preserving general chemical understanding across related tasks. Here, we evaluate Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) as a parameter-efficient alternative to full fine-tuning for organic reaction prediction on limited, complex datasets. Using USPTO reaction classes and challenging C-H functionalisation reactions, we benchmark forward reaction prediction, retrosynthesis and reagent prediction. LoRA achieves accuracy comparable to full fine-tuning while effectively mitigating catastrophic forgetting and better preserving multi-task performance. Both fine-tuning approaches generalise beyond training distributions, producing plausible alternative solvent predictions. Notably, C-H functionalisation fine-tuning reveals that LoRA and full fine-tuning encode subtly different reactivity patterns, suggesting more effective reaction-specific adaptation with LoRA. As LLMs continue to scale, our results highlight the practicality of modular, parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies for their flexible deployment for chemistry applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To accelerate inference, recent works like GenDR adopt step distillation to minimize the step number to one. However, the memory boundary still restricts the maximum processing size, necessitating tile-by-tile restoration of high-resolution images. Through profiling the pipeline, we pinpoint that the variational auto-encoder (VAE) is the bottleneck of latency and memory. To completely solve the problem, we leverage pixel-(un)shuffle operations to eliminate the VAE, reversing the latent-based GenDR to pixel-space GenDR-Pix. However, upscale with x8 pixelshuffle may induce artifacts of repeated patterns. To alleviate the distortion, we propose a multi-stage adversarial distillation to progressively remove the encoder and decoder. Specifically, we utilize generative features from the previous stage models to guide adversarial discrimination. Moreover, we propose random padding to augment generative features and avoid discriminator collapse. We also introduce a masked Fourier space loss to penalize the outliers of amplitude. To improve inference performance, we empirically integrate a padding-based self-ensemble with classifier-free guidance to improve inference scaling. Experimental results show that GenDR-Pix performs 2.8x acceleration and 60% memory-saving compared to GenDR with negligible visual degradation, surpassing other one-step diffusion SR.

However, we identify a previously underexplored generation failure: severe output repetition, where models degenerate into self-reinforcing loops of repeated phrases or sentences. This failure mode is not captured by existing VideoLLM benchmarks, which focus primarily on task accuracy and factual correctness. We introduce VideoSTF, the first framework for systematically measuring and stress-testing output repetition in VideoLLMs. VideoSTF formalizes repetition using three complementary n-gram-based metrics and provides a standardized testbed of 10,000 diverse videos together with a library of controlled temporal transformations. Using VideoSTF, we conduct pervasive testing, temporal stress testing, and adversarial exploitation across 10 advanced VideoLLMs. We find that output repetition is widespread and, critically, highly sensitive to temporal perturbations of video inputs. Moreover, we show that simple temporal transformations can efficiently induce repetitive degeneration in a black-box setting, exposing output repetition as an exploitable security vulnerability. Our results reveal output repetition as a fundamental stability issue in modern VideoLLMs and motivate stability-aware evaluation for video-language systems.

We revisit this assumption for pre-norm Transformers and ask to what extent sample-dependent normalization is needed inside Transformer blocks. We introduce TaperNorm, a drop-in replacement for RMSNorm/LayerNorm that behaves exactly like the standard normalizer early in training and then smoothly tapers to a learned sample-independent linear/affine map. A single global gate is held at $g{=}1$ during gate warmup, used to calibrate the scaling branch via EMAs, and then cosine-decayed to $g{=}0$, at which point per-token statistics vanish and the resulting fixed scalings can be folded into adjacent linear projections. Our theoretical and empirical results isolate scale anchoring as the key role played by output normalization: as a (near) $0$-homogeneous map it removes radial gradients at the output, whereas without such an anchor cross-entropy encourages unbounded logit growth (``logit chasing''). We further show that a simple fixed-target auxiliary loss on the pre-logit residual-stream scale provides an explicit alternative anchor and can aid removal of the final normalization layer. Empirically, TaperNorm matches normalized baselines under identical setups while eliminating per-token statistics and enabling these layers to be folded into adjacent linear projections at inference. On an efficiency microbenchmark, folding internal scalings yields up to $1.22\\times$ higher throughput in last-token logits mode.

However, when applied to offline historical logs, these methods suffer a critical failure: the dominance of low-quality data induces severe model collapse. We first establish the Divergence Theory of Repulsive Optimization, revealing that negative gradient updates inherently trigger exponential intensity explosion during off-policy training. This theory elucidates the inherent dilemma of existing methods, exposing their inability to reconcile variance reduction and noise imitation. To break this curse, we argue that the solution lies in rigorously identifying the latent high-quality distribution entangled within the noisy behavior policy. Accordingly, we reformulate the objective as an Optimistic Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) problem.

However, as context lengths increase, a fundamental limitation of the softmax function emerges: it tends to diffuse probability mass to irrelevant tokens degrading performance in long-sequence scenarios. Furthermore, attempts to sharpen focus by lowering softmax temperature hinder learnability due to vanishing gradients. We introduce LUCID Attention, an architectural modification that applies a preconditioner to the attention probabilities. This preconditioner, derived from exponentiated key-key similarities, minimizes overlap between the keys in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space, thus allowing the query to focus on important keys among large number of keys accurately with same computational complexity as standard attention. Additionally, LUCID's preconditioning-based approach to retrieval bypasses the need for low temperature and the learnability problems associated with it. We validate our approach by training ~1 billion parameter language models evaluated on up to 128K tokens. Our results demonstrate significant gains on long-context retrieval tasks, specifically retrieval tasks from BABILong, RULER, SCROLLS and LongBench. For instance, LUCID achieves up to 18% improvement in BABILong and 14% improvement in RULER multi-needle performance compared to standard attention.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, developing reliable AI systems for autonomous vehicles remains a substantial challenge. Over the past decade, multi-task learning has emerged as a powerful approach to address complex problems in driving perception. Multi-task networks offer several advantages, including increased computational efficiency, real-time processing capabilities, optimized resource utilization, and improved generalization. In this study, we present AurigaNet, an advanced multi-task network architecture designed to push the boundaries of autonomous driving perception. AurigaNet integrates three critical tasks: object detection, lane detection, and drivable area instance segmentation. The system is trained and evaluated using the BDD100K dataset, renowned for its diversity in driving conditions. Key innovations of AurigaNet include its end-to-end instance segmentation capability, which significantly enhances both accuracy and efficiency in path estimation for autonomous vehicles. Experimental results demonstrate that AurigaNet achieves an 85.2% IoU in drivable area segmentation, outperforming its closest competitor by 0.7%. In lane detection, AurigaNet achieves a remarkable 60.8% IoU, surpassing other models by more than 30%. Furthermore, the network achieves an mAP@0.5:0.95 of 47.6% in traffic object detection, exceeding the next leading model by 2.9%. Additionally, we validate the practical feasibility of AurigaNet by deploying it on embedded devices such as the Jetson Orin NX, where it demonstrates competitive real-time performance. These results underscore AurigaNet's potential as a robust and efficient solution for autonomous driving perception systems.

Built on a $\\sim$1M-parameter LightGTS backbone, LightGTS-Cov adds only a $\\sim$0.1M-parameter MLP plug-in that integrates time-aligned covariates into the target forecasts by residually refining the outputs of the decoding process. Across covariate-aware benchmarks on electricity price and energy generation datasets, LightGTS-Cov consistently outperforms LightGTS and achieves superior performance over other covariate-aware baselines under both settings, regardless of whether future-known covariates are provided. We further demonstrate its practical value in two real-world energy case applications: long-term photovoltaic power forecasting with future weather forecasts and day-ahead electricity price forecasting with weather and dispatch-plan covariates. Across both applications, LightGTS-Cov achieves strong forecasting accuracy and stable operational performance after deployment, validating its effectiveness in real-world industrial settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, modifying the original text prompt to achieve the expected semantic adjustments often results in unintended global structure changes that disrupt user intent. Existing methods rely on empirical feature map selection for intervention, whose performance heavily depends on appropriate selection, leading to suboptimal stability. This paper tries to solve the aforementioned problem from a frequency perspective and analyzes the impact of the frequency spectrum of noisy latent variables on the hierarchical emergence of the structure framework and fine-grained textures during the generation process. We find that lower-frequency components are primarily responsible for establishing the structure framework in the early generation stage. Their influence diminishes over time, giving way to higher-frequency components that synthesize fine-grained textures. In light of this, we propose a training-free frequency modulation method utilizing a frequency-dependent weighting function with dynamic decay. This method maintains the structure framework consistency while permitting targeted semantic modifications. By directly manipulating the noisy latent variable, the proposed method avoids the empirical selection of internal feature maps.

To bridge this gap, we propose TwiFF-2.7M, the first large-scale, temporally grounded VCoT dataset derived from $2.7$ million video clips, explicitly designed for dynamic visual question and answer. Accompanying this, we introduce TwiFF-Bench, a high-quality evaluation benchmark of $1,078$ samples that assesses both the plausibility of reasoning trajectories and the correctness of final answers in open-ended dynamic settings. Building on these foundations, we propose the TwiFF model, a unified modal that synergistically leverages pre-trained video generation and image comprehension capabilities to produce temporally coherent visual reasoning cues-iteratively generating future action frames and textual reasoning.

In modern overparameterized models, forming or inverting $F\\in\\mathbb{R}^{d\\times d}$ is prohibitive, motivating scalable influence computation via random projection with a sketch $P \\in \\mathbb{R}^{m\\times d}$. This practice is commonly justified via the Johnson--Lindenstrauss (JL) lemma, which ensures approximate preservation of Euclidean geometry for a fixed dataset. However, JL does not address how sketching behaves under inversion. Furthermore, there is no existing theory that explains how sketching interacts with other widely-used techniques, such as ridge regularization and structured curvature approximations.\n  We develop a unified theory characterizing when projection provably preserves influence functions. When $g,g^{\\prime}\\in\\text{range}(F)$, we show that: 1) Unregularized projection: exact preservation holds iff $P$ is injective on $\\text{range}(F)$, which necessitates $m\\geq \\text{rank}(F)$; 2) Regularized projection: ridge regularization fundamentally alters the sketching barrier, with approximation guarantees governed by the effective dimension of $F$ at the regularization scale; 3) Factorized influence: for Kronecker-factored curvatures $F=A\\otimes E$, the guarantees continue to hold for decoupled sketches $P=P_A\\otimes P_E$, even though such sketches exhibit row correlations that violate i.i.d. assumptions. Beyond this range-restricted setting, we analyze out-of-range test gradients and quantify a \\emph{leakage} term that arises when test gradients have components in $\\ker(F)$. This yields guarantees for influence queries on general test points.\n  Overall, this work develops a novel theory that characterizes when projection provably preserves influence and provides principled guidance for choosing the sketch size in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u6295\u5f71\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u51fd\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u6295\u5f71\u5982\u4f55\u4e0e\u5cad\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u66f2\u7387\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7b49\u5e38\u7528\u6280\u672f\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u8349\u56fe\u5927\u5c0f\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u5f62\u6210\u6216\u6c42\u9006\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e3ad\u00d7d\u7684\u66f2\u7387\u7b97\u5b50F\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u666e\u904d\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u6295\u5f71\u8fdb\u884c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7684Johnson-Lindenstrauss\u5f15\u7406\u53ea\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u6301\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u6295\u5f71\u5728\u9006\u8fd0\u7b97\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e5f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e0e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7b49\u6280\u672f\u7684\u534f\u540c\u7406\u8bba\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6295\u5f71\u53d8\u6362\u6ee1\u8db3\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u5355\u5c04\u6027\u3001\u6709\u6548\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u6cc4\u9732\u9879\uff09\u6765\u523b\u753b\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u5206\u6790\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u65e0\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6295\u5f71\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u4fdd\u6301\u6761\u4ef6\uff1b2\uff09\u5cad\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5982\u4f55\u6539\u53d8\u6295\u5f71\u969c\u788d\uff1b3\uff09Kronecker\u5206\u89e3\u66f2\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u89e3\u8026\u6295\u5f71\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b4\uff09\u6d4b\u8bd5\u68af\u5ea6\u8d85\u51fa\u8303\u56f4\u65f6\u7684\u6cc4\u9732\u9879\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a1\uff09\u5f53g,g\u2032\u2208range(F)\u65f6\uff0c\u65e0\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6295\u5f71\u7cbe\u786e\u4fdd\u6301\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u51fd\u6570\u5f53\u4e14\u4ec5\u5f53P\u5728range(F)\u4e0a\u662f\u5355\u5c04\uff0c\u8fd9\u8981\u6c42m\u2265rank(F)\uff1b2\uff09\u5cad\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u6295\u5f71\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4fdd\u8bc1\u7531\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0bF\u7684\u6709\u6548\u7ef4\u5ea6\u51b3\u5b9a\uff1b3\uff09\u5bf9\u4e8eKronecker\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u66f2\u7387F=A\u2297E\uff0c\u89e3\u8026\u6295\u5f71P=PA\u2297PE\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff1b4\uff09\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e00\u822c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u70b9\uff0c\u6cc4\u9732\u9879\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\u68af\u5ea6\u5728ker(F)\u4e2d\u5206\u91cf\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6295\u5f71\u6280\u672f\u4fdd\u6301\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u51fd\u6570\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u8349\u56fe\u5927\u5c0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u6295\u5f71\u4e0e\u9006\u8fd0\u7b97\u3001\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6280\u672f\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7a7a\u767d\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework that integrates depth estimation into VLA models to enrich 3D feature representations. Specifically, we employ a depth estimation baseline called VGGT to extract geometry-aware 3D cues from standard RGB inputs, enabling efficient utilization of existing large-scale 2D datasets while implicitly recovering 3D structural information. To further enhance the reliability of these depth-derived features, we introduce a new module called action assistant, which constrains the learned 3D representations with action priors and ensures their consistency with downstream control tasks. By fusing the enhanced 3D features with conventional 2D visual tokens, our approach significantly improves the generalization ability and robustness of VLA models. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method not only strengthens perception in geometrically ambiguous scenarios but also leads to superior action prediction accuracy.

Procedural alternatives introduce stepwise generation but often rely on mechanism-specific supervision, discrete symbolic edits, and computationally expensive inference. In this work, we propose LatentRxnFlow, a new reaction prediction paradigm that models reactions as continuous latent trajectories anchored at the thermodynamic product state. Built on Conditional Flow Matching, our approach learns time-dependent latent dynamics directly from standard reactant-product pairs, without requiring mechanistic annotations or curated intermediate labels. While LatentRxnFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance on USPTO benchmarks, more importantly, the continuous formulation exposes the full generative trajectory, enabling trajectory-level diagnostics that are difficult to realize with discrete or one-shot models. We show that latent trajectory analysis allows us to localize and characterize failure modes and to mitigate certain errors via gated inference. Furthermore, geometric properties of the learned trajectories provide an intrinsic signal of epistemic uncertainty, helping prioritize reliably predictable reaction outcomes and flag ambiguous cases for additional validation. Overall, LatentRxnFlow combines strong predictive accuracy with improved transparency, diagnosability, and uncertainty awareness, moving reaction prediction toward more trustworthy deployment in high-throughput discovery workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Two complementary approaches have emerged to address these issues: token-adaptive layer execution, which reduces floating-point operations (FLOPs) by selectively bypassing layers, and quantization, which lowers memory footprint by reducing weight precision. However, naively integrating these techniques leads to additional accuracy degradation due to reduced redundancy in token-adaptive models. We propose QTALE (Quantization-Robust Token-Adaptive Layer Execution for LLMs), a novel framework that enables seamless integration of token-adaptive execution with quantization while preserving accuracy. Conventional token-adaptive methods reduce redundancy in two ways: (1) by limiting the diversity of training paths explored during fine-tuning, and (2) by lowering the number of parameters actively involved in inference. To overcome these limitations, QTALE introduces two key components: (1) a training strategy that ensures diverse execution paths are actively explored during fine-tuning, and (2) a post-training mechanism that allows flexible adjustment of the execution ratio at inference to reintroduce redundancy when needed. Experimental results show that QTALE enables seamless integration of token-adaptive layer execution with quantization, showing no noticeable accuracy difference, with the gap to quantization-only models kept below 0.5% on CommonsenseQA benchmarks. By combining token-adaptive execution for FLOPs reduction and quantization for memory savings, QTALE provides an effective solution for efficient LLM deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing methods predominantly operate within a 2D manifold, neglecting the underlying 3D geometry where view-dependent vertical facades (macro-structure) and scale variations (micro-scale) severely corrupt feature alignment. To bridge this gap, we propose (MGS)$^2$, a geometry-grounded framework. The core of our innovation is the Macro-Geometric Structure Filtering (MGSF) module. Unlike pixel-wise matching sensitive to noise, MGSF leverages dilated geometric gradients to physically filter out high-frequency facade artifacts while enhancing the view-invariant horizontal plane, directly addressing the domain shift. To guarantee robust input for this structural filtering, we explicitly incorporate a Micro-Geometric Scale Adaptation (MGSA) module. MGSA utilizes depth priors to dynamically rectify scale discrepancies via multi-branch feature fusion. Furthermore, a Geometric-Appearance Contrastive Distillation (GACD) loss is designed to strictly discriminate against oblique occlusions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that (MGS)$^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance, recording a Recall@1 of 97.5\\% on University-1652 and 97.02\\% on SUES-200.

Existing methods attempt to reduce distributional shifts by aligning manually selected graph elements (e.g., node attributes or structural statistics), which typically require manually designed graph filters to extract relevant features before alignment. However, such approaches are inflexible: they rely on scenario-specific heuristics, and struggle when dominant discrepancies vary across transfer scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{ADAlign}, an Adaptive Distribution Alignment framework for GDA. Unlike heuristic methods, ADAlign requires no manual specification of alignment criteria. It automatically identifies the most relevant discrepancies in each transfer and aligns them jointly, capturing the interplay between attributes, structures, and their dependencies. This makes ADAlign flexible, scenario-aware, and robust to diverse and dynamically evolving shifts. To enable this adaptivity, we introduce the Neural Spectral Discrepancy (NSD), a theoretically principled parametric distance that provides a unified view of cross-graph shifts. NSD leverages neural characteristic function in the spectral domain to encode feature-structure dependencies of all orders, while a learnable frequency sampler adaptively emphasizes the most informative spectral components for each task via minimax paradigm.

However, it remains challenging due to cluttered backgrounds, severe scale variation, and large orientation changes. Existing approaches largely improve performance through multi-scale feature fusion with feature pyramid networks or contextual modeling with attention, but they often lack explicit foreground modeling and do not leverage geometric orientation priors, which limits feature discriminability. To overcome these limitations, we propose FGAA-FPN, a Foreground-Guided Angle-Aware Feature Pyramid Network for oriented object detection. FGAA-FPN is built on a hierarchical functional decomposition that accounts for the distinct spatial resolution and semantic abstraction across pyramid levels, thereby strengthening multi-scale representations. Concretely, a Foreground-Guided Feature Modulation module learns foreground saliency under weak supervision to enhance object regions and suppress background interference in low-level features. In parallel, an Angle-Aware Multi-Head Attention module encodes relative orientation relationships to guide global interactions among high-level semantic features. Extensive experiments on DOTA v1.0 and DOTA v1.5 demonstrate that FGAA-FPN achieves state-of-the-art results, reaching 75.5% and 68.3% mAP, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our primary finding is that despite operating in high-dimensional parameter spaces ($d=128$), transformer training trajectories rapidly collapse onto low-dimensional execution manifolds of dimension $3$--$4$. This dimensional collapse is robust across random seeds and moderate task difficulties, though the orientation of the manifold in parameter space varies between runs. We demonstrate that this geometric structure underlies several empirically observed phenomena: (1) sharp attention concentration emerges as saturation along routing coordinates within the execution manifold, (2) stochastic gradient descent (SGD) exhibits approximately integrable dynamics when projected onto the execution subspace, with non-integrability confined to orthogonal staging directions, and (3) sparse autoencoders capture auxiliary routing structure but fail to isolate execution itself, which remains distributed across the low-dimensional manifold. Our results suggest a unifying geometric framework for understanding transformer learning, where the vast majority of parameters serve to absorb optimization interference while core computation occurs in a dramatically reduced subspace.

Firstly, we demonstrate TerraMind's LULC generation capabilities. Lastly, we explore the utility of the GFMs in forest functional trait mapping and peatlands detection. In all experiments, the GFMs outperform the baseline ResNet models. In general TerraMind marginally outperforms Prithvi. However, with additional modalities TerraMind significantly outperforms the baseline ResNet and Prithvi models.

In the Deep Generative Prior (DGP) framework, the use of diffusion-based generative models is combined with an iterative optimization algorithm for the reconstruction of CT images from sinograms acquired under sparse geometries, to maintain the explainability of a model-based approach while introducing the generative power of a neural network.

Unlike many clustering methods, HAC does not optimize a single explicit global objective; clustering quality is therefore primarily evaluated empirically, and the choice of linkage function plays a crucial role in practice. However, popular classical linkages, such as single-linkage, average-linkage and Ward's method show high variability across real-world datasets and do not consistently produce high-quality clusterings in practice.\n  In this paper, we propose \\emph{Chamfer-linkage}, a novel linkage function that measures the distance between clusters using the Chamfer distance, a popular notion of distance between point-clouds in machine learning and computer vision. We argue that Chamfer-linkage satisfies desirable concept representation properties that other popular measures struggle to satisfy. Theoretically, we show that Chamfer-linkage HAC can be implemented in $O(n^2)$ time, matching the efficiency of classical linkage functions. Experimentally, we find that Chamfer-linkage consistently yields higher-quality clusterings than classical linkages such as average-linkage and Ward's method across a diverse collection of datasets.

However, reproducible comparisons has been limited by ethical constraints in human studies and the lack of open benchmark datasets. To address this gap, we introduce a new dataset, the first reproducible benchmark for PD prediction. It is constructed from long-term ECoG recordings of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced rat models and annotated with neural responses measured before and after electrical stimulation. In addition, we propose a Swap-Adversarial Framework (SAF) that mitigates high inter-subject variability and the high-dimensional low-sample-size (HDLSS) problem in ECoG data, while achieving robust domain generalization across ECoG and EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) datasets. The framework integrates (1) robust preprocessing, (2) Inter-Subject Balanced Channel Swap (ISBCS) for cross-subject augmentation, and (3) domain-adversarial training to suppress subject-specific bias. ISBCS randomly swaps channels between subjects to reduce inter-subject variability, and domain-adversarial training jointly encourages the model to learn task-relevant shared features. We validated the effectiveness of the proposed method through extensive experiments under cross-subject, cross-session, and cross-dataset settings. Our method consistently outperformed all baselines across all settings, showing the most significant improvements in highly variable environments.

In contrast to SR artifacts arising from synthetic LR images created under well-defined scenarios, those distortions are highly unpredictable and vary significantly across different real-life contexts. Consequently, assessing the quality of SR images (SR-IQA) obtained from realistic LR, remains a challenging and underexplored problem. In this work, we introduce a no-reference SR-IQA approach tailored for such highly ill-posed realistic settings. The proposed method enables domain-adaptive IQA for real-world SR applications, particularly in data-scarce domains. We hypothesize that degradations in super-resolved images are strongly dependent on the underlying SR algorithms, rather than being solely determined by image content. To this end, we introduce a self-supervised learning (SSL) strategy that first pretrains multiple SR model oriented representations in a pretext stage. Our contrastive learning framework forms positive pairs from images produced by the same SR model and negative pairs from those generated by different methods, independent of image content. The proposed approach S3 RIQA, further incorporates targeted preprocessing to extract complementary quality information and an auxiliary task to better handle the various degradation profiles associated with different SR scaling factors. To this end, we constructed a new dataset, SRMORSS, to support unsupervised pretext training; it includes a wide range of SR algorithms applied to numerous real LR images, which addresses a gap in existing datasets.

It remains unclear whether the most common workaround -- tuning on smaller models and extrapolating via hyperparameter scaling laws -- is still sound when using upscaling. We address this with principled approaches to upscaling with respect to model widths and efficiently tuning hyperparameters in this setting.

In such settings, learning the full conditional distribution of admissible outcomes in a physically consistent and interpretable manner remains a challenge. While recent advances in machine learning have enabled powerful multimodal generative modeling, their integration with physics-constrained scientific modeling remains nontrivial, particularly when physical structure must be preserved or data are limited. This work develops a physics-informed multimodal conditional modeling framework based on mixture density representations. Mixture density networks (MDNs) provide an explicit and interpretable parameterization of multimodal conditional distributions. Physical knowledge is embedded through component-specific regularization terms that penalize violations of governing equations or physical laws. This formulation naturally accommodates non-uniqueness and stochasticity while remaining computationally efficient and amenable to conditioning on contextual inputs. The proposed framework is evaluated across a range of scientific problems in which multimodality arises from intrinsic physical mechanisms rather than observational noise, including bifurcation phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems, stochastic partial differential equations, and atomistic-scale shock dynamics. In addition, the proposed method is compared with a conditional flow matching (CFM) model, a representative state-of-the-art generative modeling approach, demonstrating that MDNs can achieve competitive performance while offering a simpler and more interpretable formulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing approaches to counterfactual explanation typically ask: What is the closest alternative input that would alter the model's prediction in a desired way? In contrast, we explore counterfactual datasets. Rather than perturbing the input, our method efficiently finds the closest alternative training dataset, one that differs from the original dataset by changing a few labels. Training a new model on this altered dataset can then lead to a different prediction of a given test instance. This perspective provides a new way to assess fairness by directly analyzing the influence of label bias on training and inference. Our approach can be characterized as probing whether a given prediction depends on biased labels. Since exhaustively enumerating all possible alternate datasets is infeasible, we develop analysis techniques that trace how bias in the training data may propagate through the learning algorithm to the trained network. Our method heuristically ranks and modifies the labels of a bounded number of training examples to construct a counterfactual dataset, retrains the model, and checks whether its prediction on a chosen test case changes. We evaluate our approach on feedforward neural networks across over 1100 test cases from 7 widely-used fairness datasets. Results show that it modifies only a small subset of training labels, highlighting its ability to pinpoint the critical training examples that drive prediction changes.

While consistency models (CMs) represent a state-of-the-art distillation-based approach for efficient generation, their large-scale application is still limited by two key issues: training instability and inflexible sampling. Existing methods seek to mitigate these problems through architectural adjustments or regularized objectives, yet overlook the critical reliance on trajectory selection. In this work, we first conduct an analysis on these two limitations: training instability originates from loss divergence induced by unstable self-supervised term, whereas sampling inflexibility arises from error accumulation. Based on these insights and analysis, we propose the Dual-End Consistency Model (DE-CM) that selects vital sub-trajectory clusters to achieve stable and effective training. DE-CM decomposes the PF-ODE trajectory and selects three critical sub-trajectories as optimization targets. Specifically, our approach leverages continuous-time CMs objectives to achieve few-step distillation and utilizes flow matching as a boundary regularizer to stabilize the training process. Furthermore, we propose a novel noise-to-noisy (N2N) mapping that can map noise to any point, thereby alleviating the error accumulation in the first step.

To test this hypothesis, we systematically evaluate the OOD generalization of SFT models across training datasets of varying difficulty levels. Our results confirm that data difficulty is a critical factor, revealing that training on hard samples significantly degrades OOD performance. Motivated by this finding, we introduce Difficulty-Curated SFT (DC-SFT), a straightforward method that explicitly filters the training set based on sample difficulty.

However, attempts to further improve LoopLM reasoning with reinforcement learning have failed - standard objectives such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) only assign credit to the final latent state, creating a fundamental mismatch with the model's internal computation. To resolve this, we introduce RLTT (Reward Latent Thought Trajectories), a reinforcement learning framework which distributes reward across the full latent reasoning trajectory. RLTT provides dense, trajectory-level credit assignment without relying on external verifiers and can directly replace GRPO with negligible overhead. Across extensive experiments with Ouro-2.6B-Thinking under identical training and inference conditions, RLTT yields substantial improvements over GRPO on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks, improving accuracy by +14.4% on MATH-500, +16.6% on AIME24, and +10.0% on BeyondAIME.

However, this sequential generation process is notoriously slow. While caching strategies have proven effective for accelerating traditional video diffusion models, existing methods assume uniform denoising across all frames-an assumption that breaks down in autoregressive models where different video chunks exhibit varying similarity patterns at identical timesteps. In this paper, we present FlowCache, the first caching framework specifically designed for autoregressive video generation. Our key insight is that each video chunk should maintain independent caching policies, allowing fine-grained control over which chunks require recomputation at each timestep. We introduce a chunkwise caching strategy that dynamically adapts to the unique denoising characteristics of each chunk, complemented by a joint importance-redundancy optimized KV cache compression mechanism that maintains fixed memory bounds while preserving generation quality. Our method achieves remarkable speedups of 2.38 times on MAGI-1 and 6.7 times on SkyReels-V2, with negligible quality degradation (VBench: 0.87 increase and 0.79 decrease respectively).

We decompose this into three technical challenges: spectral interaction contamination, limited spectral pattern modeling, and complex weighting router problems. We propose a mixture of prototypes (MoP) network with: (1) Band split for spectral isolation, (2) Prototype-based spectral representation for diverse patterns, and (3) Dual-level router for adaptive spatial-aware band weighting.

Through systematic investigation, we uncover the mechanisms underlying these bottlenecks, revealing that simple yet principled solutions suffice: base-policy transitions serve as an essential value anchor for implicit warmup, and critic normalization effectively restores representation sensitivity for discerning value differences.

Existing debiasing methods frequently yield inconsistent improvements across datasets or attain fairness by degrading overall diagnostic utility, treating fairness as a post hoc constraint rather than a property of the learned representation. In this work, we propose Stride-Net (Sensitive Attribute Resilient Learning via Disentanglement and Learnable Masking with Embedding Alignment), a fairness-aware framework that learns disease-discriminative yet demographically invariant representations for chest X-ray analysis. Stride-Net operates at the patch level, using a learnable stride-based mask to select label-aligned image regions while suppressing sensitive attribute information through adversarial confusion loss. To anchor representations in clinical semantics and discourage shortcut learning, we further enforce semantic alignment between image features and BioBERT-based disease label embeddings via Group Optimal Transport. We evaluate Stride-Net on the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert benchmarks across race and intersectional race-gender subgroups. Across architectures including ResNet and Vision Transformers, Stride-Net consistently improves fairness metrics while matching or exceeding baseline accuracy, achieving a more favorable accuracy-fairness trade-off than prior debiasing approaches.

Existing approaches largely rely on supervised fine-tuning, encouraging surface-level token imitation rather than faithful modeling of underlying chart structure, which often leads to hallucinated or semantically inconsistent outputs. We propose Chart Specification, a structured intermediate representation that shifts training from text imitation to semantically grounded supervision. Chart Specification filters syntactic noise to construct a structurally balanced training set and supports a Spec-Align Reward that provides fine-grained, verifiable feedback on structural correctness, enabling reinforcement learning to enforce consistent plotting logic. Experiments on three public benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms prior approaches. With only 3K training samples, we achieve strong data efficiency, surpassing leading baselines by up to 61.7% on complex benchmarks, and scaling to 4K samples establishes new state-of-the-art results across all evaluated metrics. Overall, our results demonstrate that precise structural supervision offers an efficient pathway to high-fidelity chart-to-code generation.

By calculating the temporal residuals of scene representations, the information of dynamic objects can be extracted without relying on detection and tracking. TR-World takes only temporal residuals as input, thus predicting the future spatial distribution of dynamic objects more precisely. By combining the prediction with the static object information contained in the current BEV features, accurate future BEV features can be obtained. Furthermore, we propose Future-Guided Trajectory Refinement (FGTR) module, which conducts interaction between prior trajectories (predicted from the current scene representation) and the future BEV features.

To address these limitations, we propose Prototype-based Graph-Level Anomaly Detection (ProtoGLAD), an interpretable unsupervised framework that provides explanation for each detected anomaly by explicitly contrasting with its nearest normal prototype graph. It employs a point-set kernel to iteratively discover multiple normal prototype graphs and their associated clusters from the dataset, then identifying graphs distant from all discovered normal clusters as anomalies.

The probability of these outputs can be reduced using methods such as LLM unlearning. However, unlearning a set of data (called the forget set) can degrade model performance on other distributions where the trainer wants to retain the model's behavior. To improve this trade-off, we demonstrate that using the forget set to compute only a few uphill Gauss-Newton steps provides a conceptually simple, state-of-the-art unlearning approach for LLMs. While Gauss-Newton steps adapt Newton's method to non-linear models, it is non-trivial to efficiently and accurately compute such steps for LLMs. Hence, our approach crucially relies on parametric Hessian approximations such as Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC). We call this combined approach K-FADE (K-FAC for Distribution Erasure). Our evaluation on the WMDP and ToFU benchmarks demonstrates that K-FADE suppresses outputs from the forget set and approximates, in output space, the results of retraining without the forget set. Critically, our method does this while altering the outputs on the retain set less than previous methods. This is because K-FADE transforms a constraint on the model's outputs across the entire retain set into a constraint on the model's weights, allowing the algorithm to minimally change the model's behavior on the retain set at each step. Moreover, the unlearning updates computed by K-FADE can be reapplied later if the model undergoes further training, allowing unlearning to be cheaply maintained.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

These images vary in size and format. The original dataset was resized to 256x256 pixels with RGB color mode for better consistency. After this, the Data augmentation process is applied to improve the dataset by generating variations of the original images. The augmented dataset consists of 3784 images using advanced preprocessing techniques. Two deep learning models were implemented to classify the images. The InceptionV3 model is well known for its advanced framework. These apply multiple convolutional filters for obtaining different features effectively. On the other hand, the ResNet50 model helps to train deeper networks by using residual learning. The InceptionV3 model achieved the impressive accuracy of 98.15%, and ResNet50got 94.46% accuracy. Data mixing methods such as CutMix and MixUp were applied to enhance the model's robustness. The confusion matrix was used to evaluate the overall model performance of both InceptionV3 and Resnet50. Additionally, SHAP analysis is used to improve interpretability, which helps to find the significant parts of the image for the model prediction. This study purposes to highlight how advanced models enhan", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, the elongated morphology, wide scale variation, and low contrast of retinal vessels pose significant challenges for existing methods, making it difficult to simultaneously preserve fine capillaries and maintain global topological continuity. To address these challenges, we propose the Vessel-aware Frequency-domain and Global Spatial modeling Network (VFGS-Net), an end-to-end segmentation framework that seamlessly integrates frequency-aware feature enhancement, dual-path convolutional representation learning, and bidirectional asymmetric spatial state-space modeling within a unified architecture. Specifically, VFGS-Net employs a dual-path feature convolution module to jointly capture fine-grained local textures and multi-scale contextual semantics. A novel vessel-aware frequency-domain channel attention mechanism is introduced to adaptively reweight spectral components, thereby enhancing vessel-relevant responses in high-level features. Furthermore, at the network bottleneck, we propose a bidirectional asymmetric Mamba2-based spatial modeling block to efficiently capture long-range spatial dependencies and strengthen the global continuity of vascular structures. Extensive experiments on four publicly available retinal vessel datasets demonstrate that VFGS-Net achieves competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our model consistently improves segmentation accuracy for fine vessels, complex branching patterns, and low-contrast regions, highlighting its robustness and clinical potential.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The clipping threshold is a critical control knob: if set too small, systematic over-clipping induces optimization bias; if too large, injected noise dominates updates and degrades accuracy. Existing adaptive clipping methods often depend on per-example gradient norm statistics, adding computational overhead and introducing sensitivity to datasets and architectures. We propose a control-driven clipping strategy that adapts the threshold using a lightweight, weight-only spectral diagnostic computed from model parameters. At periodic probe steps, the method analyzes a designated weight matrix via spectral decomposition and estimates a heavy-tailed spectral indicator associated with training stability. This indicator is smoothed over time and fed into a bounded feedback controller that updates the clipping threshold multiplicatively in the log domain. Because the controller uses only parameters produced during privacy-preserving training, the resulting threshold updates are post-processing and do not increase privacy loss beyond that of the underlying DP optimizer under standard composition accounting.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A well-known vulnerability is a backdoor introduced into a neural network by poisoned training data or a malicious training process. Backdoors can be used to induce unwanted behavior by including a certain trigger in the input. Existing mitigations filter training data, modify the model, or perform expensive input modifications on samples. If a vulnerable model has already been deployed, however, those strategies are either ineffective or inefficient. To address this gap, we propose our inference-time backdoor mitigation approach called FIRE (Feature-space Inference-time REpair). We hypothesize that a trigger induces structured and repeatable changes in the model's internal representation. We view the trigger as directions in the latent spaces between layers that can be applied in reverse to correct the inference mechanism. Therefore, we turn the backdoored model against itself by manipulating its latent representations and moving a poisoned sample's features along the backdoor directions to neutralize the trigger. Our evaluation shows that FIRE has low computational overhead and outperforms current runtime mitigations on image benchmarks across various attacks, datasets, and network architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this, we study the two-model risk change, $\u0394R := R_P(\\tilde{Q}) - R_P(Q)$, under covariate shift. We introduce TRACE (Theoretical Risk Attribution under Covariate-shift Effects), a framework that decomposes $|\u0394R|$ into an interpretable upper bound. This decomposition disentangles the risk change into four actionable factors: two generalization gaps, a model change penalty, and a covariate shift penalty, transforming the bound into a powerful diagnostic tool for understanding why performance has changed. To make TRACE a fully computable diagnostic, we instantiate each term. The covariate shift penalty is estimated via a model sensitivity factor (from high-quantile input gradients) and a data-shift measure; we use feature-space Optimal Transport (OT) by default and provide a robust alternative using Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). The model change penalty is controlled by the average output distance between the two models on the target sample. Generalization gaps are estimated on held-out data. We validate our framework in an idealized linear regression setting, showing the TRACE bound correctly captures the scaling of the true risk difference with the magnitude of the shift. Across synthetic and vision benchmarks, TRACE diagnostics are valid and maintain a strong monotonic relationship with the true performance degradation. Crucially, we derive a deployment gate score that correlates strongly with $|\u0394R|$ and achieves high AUROC/AUPRC for gating decisions, enabling safe, label-efficient model replacement.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce SVD-Inspired Attention (SVDA) into the Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT), providing the first spectrally structured formulation of attention for dense prediction tasks. SVDA decouples directional alignment from spectral modulation by embedding a learnable diagonal matrix into normalized query-key interactions, enabling attention maps that are intrinsically interpretable rather than post-hoc approximations. Experiments on KITTI and NYU-v2 show that SVDA preserves or slightly improves predictive accuracy while adding only minor computational overhead. More importantly, SVDA unlocks six spectral indicators that quantify entropy, rank, sparsity, alignment, selectivity, and robustness. These reveal consistent cross-dataset and depth-wise patterns in how attention organizes during training, insights that remain inaccessible in standard Transformers. By shifting the role of attention from opaque mechanism to quantifiable descriptor, SVDA redefines interpretability in monocular depth estimation and opens a principled avenue toward transparent dense prediction models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Using a differentiable dynamic chunking mechanism, dnaHNet compresses raw nucleotides into latent tokens adaptively, balancing compression with predictive accuracy. Pretrained on prokaryotic genomes, dnaHNet outperforms leading architectures including StripedHyena2 in scaling and efficiency. This recursive chunking yields quadratic FLOP reductions, enabling $>3 \\times$ inference speedup over Transformers. On zero-shot tasks, dnaHNet achieves superior performance in predicting protein variant fitness and gene essentiality, while automatically discovering hierarchical biological structures without supervision.

Despite recent progress of large visual-language models and agentic AI, accurately counting such instruments remains highly challenging, particularly in dense scenarios where instruments are tightly clustered. To address this problem, we introduce Chain-of-Look, a novel visual reasoning framework that mimics the sequential human counting process by enforcing a structured visual chain, rather than relying on classic object detection which is unordered. This visual chain guides the model to count along a coherent spatial trajectory, improving accuracy in complex scenes. To further enforce the physical plausibility of the visual chain, we introduce the neighboring loss function, which explicitly models the spatial constraints inherent to densely packed surgical instruments. We also present SurgCount-HD, a new dataset comprising 1,464 high-density surgical instrument images.

This limitation prevents them from effectively capturing global periodic patterns that often span cycles significantly longer than the input horizon - despite such patterns carrying strong predictive signals. Naive solutions, such as extending the historical window, lead to severe drawbacks, including overfitting, prohibitive computational costs, and redundant information processing. To address these challenges, we introduce the Global Temporal Retriever (GTR), a lightweight and plug-and-play module designed to extend any forecasting model's temporal awareness beyond the immediate historical context. GTR maintains an adaptive global temporal embedding of the entire cycle and dynamically retrieves and aligns relevant global segments with the input sequence. By jointly modeling local and global dependencies through a 2D convolution and residual fusion, GTR effectively bridges short-term observations with long-term periodicity without altering the host model architecture. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that GTR consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance across both short-term and long-term forecasting scenarios, while incurring minimal parameter and computational overhead.

These dual limitations underscore the critical need to develop lightweight yet structurally precise architectures. Our framework addresses these limitations through a three-stage architecture incorporating three novel modules: the Shuffle-Dilation Convolution (SDC) module for local feature extraction, the Rotation-Adaptive Kernel Attention (RAKA) module for hierarchical feature enhancement, and the Deep Frequency Signal Purification (DFSP) module for global feature purification.

Whether these capabilities translate to mission-critical applications such as electricity demand forecasting--where accuracy, calibration, and robustness directly affect grid operations--remains an open question. We present a multi-dimensional benchmark evaluating four TSFMs (Chronos-Bolt, Chronos-2, Moirai-2, and TinyTimeMixer) alongside Prophet as an industry-standard baseline and two statistical references (SARIMA and Seasonal Naive), using ERCOT hourly load data from 2020 to 2024. All experiments run on consumer-grade hardware (AMD Ryzen 7, 16GB RAM, no GPU). The evaluation spans four axes: (1) context length sensitivity from 24 to 2048 hours, (2) probabilistic forecast calibration, (3) robustness under distribution shifts including COVID-19 lockdowns and Winter Storm Uri, and (4) prescriptive analytics for operational decision support. The top-performing foundation models achieve MASE values near 0.31 at long context lengths (C = 2048h, day-ahead horizon), a 47% reduction over the Seasonal Naive baseline. The inclusion of Prophet exposes a structural advantage of pre-trained models: Prophet fails when the fitting window is shorter than its seasonality period (MASE > 74 at 24-hour context), while TSFMs maintain stable accuracy even with minimal context because they recognise temporal patterns learned during pre-training rather than estimating them from scratch. Calibration varies substantially across models--Chronos-2 produces well-calibrated prediction intervals (95% empirical coverage at 90% nominal level) while both Moirai-2 and Prophet exhibit overconfidence (~70% coverage).

Recently the proposal of ''thinking with images'' attempts to alleviate this limitation by manipulating images via external tools or code; however, the resulting visual states are often insufficiently grounded in linguistic semantics, impairing effective cross-modal alignment - particularly when visual semantics or geometric relationships must be reasoned over across distant regions or multiple images. To address these challenges, we propose ''chatting with images'', a new framework that reframes visual manipulation as language-guided feature modulation. Under the guidance of expressive language prompts, the model dynamically performs joint re-encoding over multiple image regions, enabling tighter coupling between linguistic reasoning and visual state updates. We instantiate this paradigm in ViLaVT, a novel LVLM equipped with a dynamic vision encoder explicitly designed for such interactive visual reasoning, and trained it with a two-stage curriculum combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to promote effective reasoning behaviors.

Accurate assessment is vital for adaptive learning, clinical monitoring, and brain-computer interfaces. Physiological signals such as pupillometry and electroencephalography are established biomarkers of cognitive load, but their comparative utility and practical integration as lightweight, wearable monitoring solutions remain underexplored. EEG provides high temporal resolution of neural activity. Although non-invasive, it is technologically demanding and limited in wearability and cost due to its resource-intensive nature, whereas pupillometry is non-invasive, portable, and scalable. Existing studies often rely on deep learning models with limited interpretability and substantial computational expense. This study integrates feature-based and model-driven approaches to advance time-series analysis. Using the OpenNeuro 'Digit Span Task' dataset, this study investigates cognitive load classification from EEG and pupillometry. Feature-based approaches using Catch-22 features and classical machine learning models outperform deep learning in both binary and multiclass tasks.

The recent release of the UNB StepUP-P150 dataset, the largest and most comprehensive collection of high-resolution footstep pressure recordings to date, opens new opportunities for addressing these challenges through deep learning. To mark this milestone, the First International StepUP Competition for Biometric Footstep Recognition was launched. Competitors were tasked with developing robust recognition models using the StepUP-P150 dataset that were then evaluated on a separate, dedicated test set designed to assess verification performance under challenging variations, given limited and relatively homogeneous reference data. The competition attracted global participation, with 23 registered teams from academia and industry. The top-performing team, Saeid_UCC, achieved the best equal error rate (EER) of 10.77% using a generative reward machine (GRM) optimization strategy.

Synthetic data produced by generative artificial intelligence (genAI) models trained on real data is often seen as one possible solution to comply with privacy regulations. While powerful genAI models for heterogeneous hospital time series have recently been introduced, such modeling does not guarantee privacy protection, as the generated data may still reveal identifying information about individuals in the models' training cohort. Applying established privacy mechanisms to generative time series models, however, proves challenging as post-hoc data anonymization through k-anonymization or similar techniques is limited, while model-centered privacy mechanisms that implement differential privacy (DP) may lead to unstable training, compromising the utility of generated data. Given these known limitations, privacy audits for generative time series models are currently indispensable regardless of the concrete privacy mechanisms applied to models and/or data. In this work, we use a battery of established privacy attacks to audit state-of-the-art hospital time series models, trained on the public MIMIC-IV dataset, with respect to privacy preservation. Furthermore, the eICU dataset was used to mount a privacy attack against the synthetic data generator trained on the MIMIC-IV dataset. Results show that established privacy attacks are ineffective against generated multivariate clinical time series when synthetic data generators are trained on large enough training datasets. Furthermore, we discuss how the use of existing DP mechanisms for these synthetic data generators would not bring desired improvement in privacy, but only a decrease in utility for machine learning prediction tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

These lightweight components are designed to guide a video diffusion backbone while maintaining its core generative capabilities. By training on a specialized dataset of dynamic human motion generated from a CG simulator, HairWeaver affords fine control over hair motion and ultimately learns to produce highly realistic hair that responds naturally to movement.

In this work, we reinterpret RoPE as phase modulation applied to a bank of complex oscillators, enabling analysis through classical signal processing theory.\n  Under this formulation, we derive principled lower bounds on the RoPE base parameter that are necessary to preserve positional coherence over a target context length. These include a fundamental aliasing bound, analogous to a Nyquist limit, and a DC-component stability bound that constrains phase drift in low-frequency positional modes. We further extend this analysis to deep transformers, showing that repeated rotary modulation across layers compounds angular misalignment, tightening the base requirement as depth increases.\n  Complementing these results, we derive a precision-dependent upper bound on the RoPE base arising from finite floating-point resolution. Beyond this limit, incremental phase updates become numerically indistinguishable, leading to positional erasure even in the absence of aliasing. Together, the lower and upper bounds define a precision- and depth-dependent feasibility region a Goldilocks zone for long-context transformers.\n  We validate the framework through a comprehensive case study of state-of-the-art models, including LLaMA, Mistral, and DeepSeek variants, showing that observed successes, failures, and community retrofits align closely with the predicted bounds.

In this work, we propose Coarse-Grained Boltzmann Generators (CG-BGs), a principled framework that unifies scalable reduced-order modeling with the exactness of importance sampling. CG-BGs act in a coarse-grained coordinate space, using a learned potential of mean force (PMF) to reweight samples generated by a flow-based model.

Across both physical and general-purpose multimodal judge benchmarks, PhyCritic achieves strong performance gains over open-source baselines and, when applied as a policy model, further improves perception and reasoning in physically grounded tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PhyCritic\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u7269\u7406AI\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6279\u8bc4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5RLVR\u7ba1\u9053\u63d0\u5347\u7269\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6279\u8bc4\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u9762\u5411\u901a\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u9886\u57df\uff08\u5982\u56fe\u50cf\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u95ee\u7b54\uff09\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6d89\u53ca\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u7269\u7406AI\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u6279\u8bc4\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u7269\u7406\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5RLVR\u7ba1\u9053\uff1a1\uff09\u7269\u7406\u6280\u80fd\u9884\u70ed\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u7269\u7406\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff1b2\uff09\u81ea\u53c2\u8003\u6279\u8bc4\u5fae\u8c03\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u6279\u8bc4\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5224\u65ad\u5019\u9009\u56de\u7b54\u524d\u5148\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5185\u90e8\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u5224\u65ad\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u7269\u7406\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7269\u7406\u548c\u901a\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u5224\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cPhyCritic\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f00\u6e90\u57fa\u7ebf\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u5f53\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u6539\u5584\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "PhyCritic\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9\u7269\u7406AI\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6279\u8bc4\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u5bfc\u5411\u6279\u8bc4\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

The proposed metrics assess how synthetic data reproduces key temporal characteristics, categorized into marginal, covariance, individual-level and measurement structures. We show that strong marginal-level resemblance may conceal distortions in covariance and disruptions in individual-level trajectories. Temporal preservation is influenced by factors such as original data quality, measurement frequency, and preprocessing strategies, including binning, variable encoding and precision. Variables with sparse or highly irregular measurement times provide limited information for learning temporal dependencies, resulting in reduced resemblance between the synthetic and original data. No single metric adequately captures temporal preservation; instead, a multidimensional evaluation across all characteristics provides a more comprehensive assessment of synthetic data quality. Overall, the proposed metrics clarify how and why temporal structures are preserved or degraded, enabling more reliable evaluation and improvement of generative models and supporting the creation of temporally realistic synthetic longitudinal patient data.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we propose DiNa-LRM, a diffusion-native latent reward model that formulates preference learning directly on noisy diffusion states. Our method introduces a noise-calibrated Thurstone likelihood with diffusion-noise-dependent uncertainty. DiNa-LRM leverages a pretrained latent diffusion backbone with a timestep-conditioned reward head, and supports inference-time noise ensembling, providing a diffusion-native mechanism for test-time scaling and robust rewarding. Across image alignment benchmarks, DiNa-LRM substantially outperforms existing diffusion-based reward baselines and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art VLMs at a fraction of the computational cost.

However, its performance degrades in high-dimensional problems with tightly coupled parameters and highly asymmetric objective landscapes, where rewards are sparse. In such needle-in-a-haystack scenarios, even advanced methods like trust-region BO (TurBO) often lead to unsatisfactory results. We propose a domain knowledge guided Bayesian Optimization approach, which leverages physical insight to fundamentally simplify the search problem by transforming coordinates to decouple input features and align the active subspaces with the primary search axes. We demonstrate this approach's efficacy on a challenging 12-dimensional, 6-crystal Split-and-Delay optical system, where conventional approaches, including standard BO, TuRBO and multi-objective BO, consistently led to unsatisfactory results. When combined with an reverse annealing exploration strategy, this approach reliably converges to the global optimum. The coordinate transformation itself is the key to this success, significantly accelerating the search by aligning input co-ordinate axes with the problem's active subspaces. As increasingly complex scientific instruments, from large telescopes to new spectrometers at X-ray Free Electron Lasers are deployed, the demand for robust high-dimensional optimization grows.

Operating under a global compression budget, ROCKET comprises two key innovations: First, it formulates layer-wise compression allocation as a multi-choice knapsack problem, selecting the optimal compression level for each layer to minimize total reconstruction error while adhering to a target model size. Second, it introduces a single-step sparse matrix factorization inspired by dictionary learning: using only a small calibration set, it sparsifies weight coefficients based on activation-weights sensitivity and then updates the dictionary in closed form via least squares bypassing iterative optimization, sparse coding, or backpropagation entirely. ROCKET consistently outperforms existing compression approaches across different model architectures at 20-50\\% compression rates. Notably, it retains over 90\\% of the original model's performance at 30\\% compression without any fine-tuning. Moreover, when applying a light fine-tuning phase, recovery is substantially enhanced: for instance, compressing Qwen3-14B to an 8B-parameter model and healing it with just 30 million tokens yields performance nearly on par with the original Qwen3-8B.

In many real-world domains, online learning in the environment can be risky, and specifying accurate safety costs can be difficult. However, it is often feasible to collect trajectories that reflect undesirable or unsafe behavior, implicitly conveying what the agent should avoid. We refer to these as non-preferred trajectories. We propose a novel offline safe IL algorithm, OSIL, that infers safety from non-preferred demonstrations. We formulate safe policy learning as a Constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP). Instead of relying on explicit safety cost and reward annotations, OSIL reformulates the CMDP problem by deriving a lower bound on reward maximizing objective and learning a cost model that estimates the likelihood of non-preferred behavior. Our approach allows agents to learn safe and reward-maximizing behavior entirely from offline demonstrations. We empirically demonstrate that our approach can learn safer policies that satisfy cost constraints without degrading the reward performance, thus outperforming several baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

These challenges include numerical heterogeneity arising from the decoupling of positional embeddings, misalignment of quantization scales in FP8 PV GEMM, and the need for optimized system-level support. In this paper, we introduce SnapMLA, an FP8 MLA decoding framework optimized to improve long-context efficiency through the following hardware-aware algorithm-kernel co-optimization techniques: (i) RoPE-Aware Per-Token KV Quantization, where the RoPE part is maintained in high precision, motivated by our comprehensive analysis of the heterogeneous quantization sensitivity inherent to the MLA KV cache. Furthermore, per-token granularity is employed to align with the autoregressive decoding process and maintain quantization accuracy. (ii) Quantized PV Computation Pipeline Reconstruction, which resolves the misalignment of quantization scale in FP8 PV computation stemming from the shared KV structure of the MLA KV cache. (iii) End-to-End Dataflow Optimization, where we establish an efficient data read-and-write workflow using specialized kernels, ensuring efficient data flow and performance gains. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art MLA LLMs show that SnapMLA achieves up to a 1.91x improvement in throughput, with negligible risk of performance degradation in challenging long-context tasks, including mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks.

For instance, in hyperparameter tuning, the validation accuracy of a model configuration (arm) typically increases with each training epoch. A defining characteristic of RMAB is em horizon-dependent optimality: unlike standard settings, the optimal strategy here shifts dramatically depending on the available budget $T$. This implies that knowledge of $T$ yields significantly greater utility in RMAB, empowering the learner to align its decision-making with this shifting optimality. However, the horizon-aware setting remains underexplored. To address this, we propose a novel CUmulative Reward Estimation UCB (CURE-UCB) that explicitly integrates the horizon. We provide a rigorous analysis establishing a new regret upper bound and prove that our method strictly outperforms horizon-agnostic strategies in structured environments like ``linear-then-flat'' instances.

While 3D diffusion transformers attain state-of-the-art results on this task, we uncover that they exhibit a catastrophic mode of failure: arbitrarily small on-surface perturbations to the input point cloud can fracture the output into multiple disconnected pieces -- a phenomenon we call Meltdown. Using activation-patching from mechanistic interpretability, we localize Meltdown to a single early denoising cross-attention activation. We find that the singular-value spectrum of this activation provides a scalar proxy: its spectral entropy rises when fragmentation occurs and returns to baseline when patched. Interpreted through diffusion dynamics, we show that this proxy tracks a symmetry-breaking bifurcation of the reverse process. Guided by this insight, we introduce PowerRemap, a test-time control that stabilizes sparse point-cloud conditioning. We demonstrate that Meltdown persists across state-of-the-art architectures (WaLa, Make-a-Shape), datasets (GSO, SimJEB) and denoising strategies (DDPM, DDIM), and that PowerRemap effectively counters this failure with stabilization rates of up to 98.3%.

Yet, existing benchmarks predominantly assess $\\textit{Crystallized Intelligence}$, which relies on recalling accumulated knowledge and learned schemas. This focus overlooks $\\textit{Generative Fluid Intelligence (GFI)}$: the capacity to induce patterns, reason through constraints, and adapt to novel scenarios on the fly. To rigorously assess this capability, we introduce $\\textbf{GENIUS}$ ($\\textbf{GEN}$ Fluid $\\textbf{I}$ntelligence Eval$\\textbf{U}$ation $\\textbf{S}$uite). We formalize $\\textit{GFI}$ as a synthesis of three primitives. These include $\\textit{Inducing Implicit Patterns}$ (e.g., inferring personalized visual preferences), $\\textit{Executing Ad-hoc Constraints}$ (e.g., visualizing abstract metaphors), and $\\textit{Adapting to Contextual Knowledge}$ (e.g., simulating counter-intuitive physics). Collectively, these primitives challenge models to solve problems grounded entirely in the immediate context. Our systematic evaluation of 12 representative models reveals significant performance deficits in these tasks. Crucially, our diagnostic analysis disentangles these failure modes. It demonstrates that deficits stem from limited context comprehension rather than insufficient intrinsic generative capability.

By computing activation-difference vectors for both test prompts and preference pairs and ranking by cosine similarity, we identify datapoints that cause specific behaviors and validate these attributions causally by retraining with modified data. Clustering behavior-datapoint similarity matrices also enables unsupervised discovery of emergent behaviors. Applying this to OLMo 2's production DPO training, we surfaced distractor-triggered compliance: a harmful behavior where the model complies with dangerous requests when benign formatting instructions are appended. Filtering top-ranked datapoints reduces this behavior by 63% while switching their labels achieves 78%.

For example, the number of up-votes on social media posts, or the number of bicycles available at a public rental station. While it is possible to model these as continuous values, and to apply traditional regression, this approach changes the underlying distribution on the labels from discrete to continuous. Discrete distributions have certain benefits, which leads us to the question whether such integer labels can be modeled directly by a discrete distribution, whose parameters are predicted from the features of a given instance. Moreover, we focus on the use case of output distributions of neural networks, which adds the requirement that the parameters of the distribution be continuous so that backpropagation and gradient descent may be used to learn the weights of the network. We investigate several options for such distributions, some existing and some novel, and test them on a range of tasks, including tabular learning, sequential prediction and image generation. We find that overall the best performance comes from two distributions: Bitwise, which represents the target integer in bits and places a Bernoulli distribution on each, and a discrete analogue of the Laplace distribution, which uses a distribution with exponentially decaying tails around a continuous mean.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, practical offline datasets often contain examples with little diversity or limited exploration of the environment, and from multiple behavior policies with diverse expertise levels. Limited exploration can impair the offline RL algorithm's ability to estimate \\textit{Q} or \\textit{V} values, while constraining towards diverse behavior policies can be overly conservative. Such datasets call for a balance between the RL objective and behavior policy constraints. We first identify the connection between $f$-divergence and optimization constraint on the Bellman residual through a more general Linear Programming form for RL and the convex conjugate. Following this, we introduce the general flexible function formulation for the $f$-divergence to incorporate an adaptive constraint on algorithms' learning objectives based on the offline training dataset.

We introduce $(t,K)$-threshold watermarking: clients collaboratively embed a shared watermark during training, while only coalitions of at least $t$ clients can reconstruct the watermark key and verify a suspect model. We secret-share the watermark key $\u03c4$ so that coalitions of fewer than $t$ clients cannot reconstruct it, and verification can be performed without revealing $\u03c4$ in the clear. We instantiate our protocol in the white-box setting and evaluate on image classification.

However, hyperparameter optimization and scaling laws have been studied primarily from the perspective of the base model's validation loss, ignoring downstream adaptability. In this work, we study pretraining from the perspective of model plasticity, that is, the ability of the base model to successfully adapt to downstream tasks through fine-tuning. We focus on the role of weight decay, a key regularization parameter during pretraining. Through systematic experiments, we show that models trained with larger weight decay values are more plastic, meaning they show larger performance gains when fine-tuned on downstream tasks. This phenomenon can lead to counterintuitive trade-offs where base models that perform worse after pretraining can perform better after fine-tuning. Further investigation of weight decay's mechanistic effects on model behavior reveals that it encourages linearly separable representations, regularizes attention matrices, and reduces overfitting on the training data. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the importance of using evaluation metrics beyond cross-entropy loss for hyperparameter optimization and casts light on the multifaceted role of that a single optimization hyperparameter plays in shaping model behavior.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u503c\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5851\u6027\uff08\u9002\u5e94\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff09\uff0c\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u503c\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5851\u6027\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u53ef\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u4ece\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5851\u6027\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u6210\u529f\u9002\u5e94\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff09\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u5851\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63a2\u7a76\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6027\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u8868\u793a\u7684\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u6027\u3001\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f83\u5927\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u503c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u5177\u53ef\u5851\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6548\u5e94\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u53cd\u76f4\u89c9\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u53ef\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u6743\u91cd\u8870\u51cf\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u8868\u793a\u3001\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u77e9\u9635\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u4f7f\u7528\u8d85\u8d8a\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u635f\u5931\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u5355\u4e2a\u4f18\u5316\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u5728\u5851\u9020\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u65b9\u9762\u4f5c\u7528\u3002"}}

Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) offers a straightforward way to inject domain knowledge but often degrades the model's generality. In contrast, on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) preserves generality but fails to effectively assimilate hard samples that exceed the model's current reasoning level. Recent off-policy RL attempts improve hard sample utilization, yet they suffer from severe training instability due to the forced distribution shift toward off-policy knowledge. To reconcile effective off-policy knowledge absorption with the stability of on-policy RL, we propose Rephrasing Policy Optimization (RePO). In RePO, the policy model is prompted to first comprehend off-policy knowledge and then rephrase it into trajectories that conform to its own stylistic and parametric distribution. RePO dynamically replaces low-reward rollouts with these rephrased, high-quality trajectories. This strategy guides the model toward correct reasoning paths while strictly preserving on-policy training dynamics. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate that RePO improves hard-sample utilization and outperforms existing baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "RePO\uff08Rephrasing Policy Optimization\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u8ba9\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u5148\u7406\u89e3\u7ebf\u4e0b\u7b56\u7565\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u5176\u91cd\u8ff0\u4e3a\u7b26\u5408\u81ea\u8eab\u98ce\u683c\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ebf\u4e0a\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u5438\u6536\u7ebf\u4e0b\u7b56\u7565\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u7528\u6027\uff0c\u7ebf\u4e0a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5438\u6536\u8d85\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u63a8\u7406\u6c34\u5e73\u7684\u56f0\u96be\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7ebf\u4e0b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u53c8\u56e0\u5f3a\u5236\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684RePO\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba9\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u9996\u5148\u7406\u89e3\u7ebf\u4e0b\u7b56\u7565\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u5176\u91cd\u8ff0\u4e3a\u7b26\u5408\u81ea\u8eab\u5206\u5e03\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u66ff\u6362\u4f4e\u5956\u52b1\u7684rollouts\uff0c\u5728\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u8d70\u5411\u6b63\u786e\u63a8\u7406\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4e25\u683c\u4fdd\u6301\u7ebf\u4e0a\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cRePO\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u56f0\u96be\u6837\u672c\u7684\u5229\u7528\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "RePO\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u8ff0\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u8c03\u89e3\u4e86\u7ebf\u4e0b\u7b56\u7565\u77e5\u8bc6\u5438\u6536\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u4e0e\u7ebf\u4e0a\u7b56\u7565\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff0c\u4e3a\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Various methods address this issue by optimizing a weighted objective that focuses on the worst-performing groups. However, this approach becomes problematic when learning with differential privacy, as unequal data weighting can result in inhomogeneous privacy guarantees, in particular weaker privacy for minority groups. In this work, we introduce a new algorithm for differentially private worst-case group optimization called ASC (Adaptively Sampled and Clipped Worst-case Group Optimization). It adaptively controls both the sampling rate and the clipping threshold of each group. Thereby, it allows for harder-to-learn groups to be sampled more often while ensuring consistent privacy guarantees across all groups. Comparing ASC to prior work, we show that it results in lower-variance gradients, tighter privacy guarantees, and substantially higher worst-case group accuracy without sacrificing overall average accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing primal-dual methods that achieve sublinear strong reward regret inevitably incur growing strong constraint violation or are restricted to average-iterate convergence due to inherent oscillations. To address these limitations, we propose the Flexible safety Domain Optimization via Margin-regularized Exploration (FlexDOME) algorithm, the first to provably achieve near-constant $\\tilde{O}(1)$ strong constraint violation alongside sublinear strong regret and non-asymptotic last-iterate convergence. FlexDOME incorporates time-varying safety margins and regularization terms into the primal-dual framework. Our theoretical analysis relies on a novel term-wise asymptotic dominance strategy, where the safety margin is rigorously scheduled to asymptotically majorize the functional decay rates of the optimization and statistical errors, thereby clamping cumulative violations to a near-constant level.

However, controlling the composition of multiple pre-trained models remains an open challenge. Current approaches largely treat composition as an algebraic composition of probability densities, such as via products or mixtures of experts. This perspective assumes the target distribution is known explicitly, which is almost never the case. In this work, we propose a different paradigm that formulates compositional generation as a cooperative Stochastic Optimal Control problem. Rather than combining probability densities, we treat pre-trained diffusion models as interacting agents whose diffusion trajectories are jointly steered, via optimal control, toward a shared objective defined on their aggregated output. We validate our framework on conditional MNIST generation and compare it against a naive inference-time DPS-style baseline replacing learned cooperative control with per-step gradient guidance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u7ec4\u5408\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u4e3a\u5408\u4f5c\u968f\u673a\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4ee3\u6570\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u548c\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u63a7\u5236\u591a\u4e2a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5c06\u7ec4\u5408\u89c6\u4e3a\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u7ec4\u5408\uff08\u5982\u4e58\u79ef\u6216\u4e13\u5bb6\u6df7\u5408\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u660e\u786e\u77e5\u9053\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u800c\u8fd9\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e2d\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u89c6\u4e3a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u5171\u540c\u5f15\u5bfc\u5b83\u4eec\u7684\u6269\u6563\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u5411\u805a\u5408\u8f93\u51fa\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u76ee\u6807\u65b9\u5411\u6f14\u8fdb\uff0c\u5c06\u7ec4\u5408\u751f\u6210\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u5408\u4f5c\u968f\u673a\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6761\u4ef6MNIST\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u7b80\u5355\u63a8\u7406\u65f6DPS\u98ce\u683c\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08\u7528\u6bcf\u6b65\u68af\u5ea6\u6307\u5bfc\u4ee3\u66ff\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u63a7\u5236\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u968f\u673a\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u8303\u5f0f\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u6982\u7387\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7ec4\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we introduce MoEEdit, the first routing-stable framework for parameter-modifying knowledge editing in MoE LLMs. Our method reparameterizes expert updates via per-expert null-space projections that keep router inputs invariant and thereby suppress routing shifts. The resulting block-structured optimization is solved efficiently with a block coordinate descent (BCD) solver.

As part of our proposal, Pram (i) quickly computes high-quality allocations by dividing the original problem into local subproblems, which are then resolved by an MLM-powered \"agent\", and (ii) ensures global consistency by harmonizing these subproblems via a multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm. Theoretically, we show that Pram, which learns to perform gradient descent in context, provably converges to the optimum within the family of MCF problems. Empirically, on real-world datasets and public topologies, Pram achieves performance comparable to, and in some cases even surpassing, linear programming solvers (very close to the optimal solution), and substantially lower runtimes (1 to 2 orders of magnitude faster).

Existing methods are either too expensive for deployment at scale, or require initial white-box access to model weights or grey-box access to log probabilities. We aim to achieve both low cost and strict black-box operation, observing only output tokens.\n  Our approach hinges on specific inputs we call Border Inputs, for which there exists more than one output top token. From a statistical perspective, optimal change detection depends on the model's Jacobian and the Fisher information of the output distribution. Analyzing these quantities in low-temperature regimes shows that border inputs enable powerful change detection tests.\n  Building on this insight, we propose the Black-Box Border Input Tracking (B3IT) scheme. Extensive in-vivo and in-vitro experiments show that border inputs are easily found for non-reasoning tested endpoints, and achieve performance on par with the best available grey-box approaches.

From this perspective, the physics penalty on the IBVP residuals can be better understood not as a regularizing term bus as an infinite source of indirect data, and the learning process as fitting the PINN distribution of residuals $p(y \\mid x, t, w) q(x, t) $ to the true data-generating distribution $\u03b4(0) q(x, t)$ by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true and PINN distributions.

We relate this failure mode to the offline-frontier shift, i.e., the displacement of the offline dataset from the Pareto front, which acts as a fundamental limitation in offline MOO.

Policy optimization algorithms generate a number of responses for a given prompt and then effectively weight the corresponding gradients depending on the rewards. The most popular algorithms including GRPO, DAPO, and RLOO focus on ambiguous prompts, i.e., prompts with intermediate success probability, while downgrading gradients with very easy and very hard prompts. In this paper, we consider asymmetric prompt weightings that assign higher weights to prompts with low, or even zero, empirical success probability. We find that asymmetric weighting particularly benefits from-scratch RL (as in R1-Zero), where training traverses a wide accuracy range, and less so in post-SFT RL where the model already starts at high accuracy. We also provide theory that characterizes prompt weights which minimize the time needed to raise success probability from an initial level to a target accuracy under a fixed update budget. In low-success regimes, where informative responses are rare and response cost dominates, these optimal weights become asymmetric, upweighting low success probabilities and thereby accelerating effective-time convergence.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce TabICLv2, a new state-of-the-art foundation model for regression and classification built on three pillars: (1) a novel synthetic data generation engine designed for high pretraining diversity; (2) various architectural innovations, including a new scalable softmax in attention improving generalization to larger datasets without prohibitive long-sequence pretraining; and (3) optimized pretraining protocols, notably replacing AdamW with the Muon optimizer. On the TabArena and TALENT benchmarks, TabICLv2 without any tuning surpasses the performance of the current state of the art, RealTabPFN-2.5 (hyperparameter-tuned, ensembled, and fine-tuned on real data). With only moderate pretraining compute, TabICLv2 generalizes effectively to million-scale datasets under 50GB GPU memory while being markedly faster than RealTabPFN-2.5.

By leveraging bidirectional attention through diffusion-based pretraining, our models capture comprehensive bidirectional context within passages, enabling the use of mean pooling and a late chunking strategy to better preserve global context across long documents. We release two model types: pplx-embed-v1 for standard retrieval, and pplx-embed-context-v1 for contextualized embeddings that incorporate global document context into passage representations. pplx-embed-v1 achieves competitive performance on the MTEB(Multilingual, v2), MTEB(Code), MIRACL, BERGEN, and ToolRet retrieval benchmarks, while pplx-embed-context-v1 sets new records on the ConTEB benchmark. Beyond public benchmarks, pplx-embed-v1 demonstrates strong performance on our internal evaluation suite, which focuses on real-world, large-scale search scenarios over tens of millions of documents.

Doing it on edge hardware improves privacy and lowers latency, but entails memory constraints. To address this, we propose Error-enhanced Contrastive Handwriting Recognition (ECHWR), a training framework designed to improve feature representation and recognition accuracy without increasing inference costs. ECHWR utilizes a temporary auxiliary branch that aligns sensor signals with semantic text embeddings during the training phase. This alignment is maintained through a dual contrastive objective: an in-batch contrastive loss for general modality alignment and a novel error-based contrastive loss that distinguishes between correct signals and synthetic hard negatives. The auxiliary branch is discarded after training, which allows the deployed model to keep its original, efficient architecture. Evaluations on the OnHW-Words500 dataset show that ECHWR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing character error rates by up to 7.4% on the writer-independent split and 10.4% on the writer-dependent split. Finally, although our ablation studies indicate that solving specific challenges require specific architectural and objective configurations, error-based contrastive loss shows its effectiveness for handling unseen writing styles.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
