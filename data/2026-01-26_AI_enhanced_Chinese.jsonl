Conventional boundary caching fails to capture this inefficiency because it treats inference as a monolithic black box.\n  We introduce SemanticALLI, a pipeline-aware architecture within Alli (PMG's marketing intelligence platform), designed to operationalize redundant reasoning. By decomposing generation into Analytic Intent Resolution (AIR) and Visualization Synthesis (VS), SemanticALLI elevates structured intermediate representations (IRs) to first-class, cacheable artifacts.\n  The impact of caching within the agentic loop is substantial. In our evaluation, baseline monolithic caching caps at a 38.7% hit rate due to linguistic variance. In contrast, our structured approach allows for an additional stage, the Visualization Synthesis stage, to achieve an 83.10% hit rate, bypassing 4,023 LLM calls with a median latency of just 2.66 ms. This internal reuse reduces total token consumption, offering a practical lesson for AI system design: even when users rarely repeat themselves, the pipeline often does, at stable, structured checkpoints where caching is most reliable.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faSemanticALLI\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u610f\u56fe\u89e3\u6790\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5408\u6210\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53ef\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u4e00\u7ea7\u5de5\u4ef6\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u667a\u80fd\u4f53AI\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u85cf\u7684\u4f4e\u6548\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u5373\u4f7f\u7528\u6237\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u5b8c\u5168\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u5b83\u4eec\u4e5f\u7ecf\u5e38\u91cd\u590d\u6784\u5efa\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u903b\u8f91\uff08\u5982\u6307\u6807\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6216\u56fe\u8868\u811a\u624b\u67b6\uff09\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u7f13\u5b58\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u6574\u4f53\u9ed1\u76d2\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u8fd9\u79cd\u4f4e\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSemanticALLI\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a1\uff09\u5206\u6790\u610f\u56fe\u89e3\u6790\uff08AIR\uff09\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c2\uff09\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5408\u6210\uff08VS\uff09\u9636\u6bb5\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u5347\u4e3a\u53ef\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u4e00\u7ea7\u5de5\u4ef6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u590d\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6574\u4f53\u7f13\u5b58\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7531\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff0c\u7f13\u5b58\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\u4e0a\u9650\u4ec5\u4e3a38.7%\u3002\u800c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5408\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8683.10%\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u547d\u4e2d\u7387\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e864023\u6b21LLM\u8c03\u7528\uff0c\u4e2d\u4f4d\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4ec52.66\u6beb\u79d2\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u603b\u4ee4\u724c\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u53d1\u73b0\u662f\uff1a\u5373\u4f7f\u7528\u6237\u5f88\u5c11\u91cd\u590d\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u8868\u8ff0\uff0c\u4f46\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5185\u90e8\u5374\u7ecf\u5e38\u91cd\u590d\u5904\u7406\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u5904\uff0c\u7f13\u5b58\u662f\u6700\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3aAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7ecf\u9a8c\uff1a\u5c06\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\u5e76\u7f13\u5b58\u4e2d\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Existing solutions for 3D scene relighting often require solving under-determined or ill-conditioned inverse rendering problems, and are as such unable to produce high-quality results on complex real-world scenes. Though recent progress in using generative image and video diffusion models for relighting has been promising, these techniques are either limited to 2D image and video relighting or 3D relighting of individual objects. Our approach enables controllable 3D relighting of room-scale scenes by distilling the outputs of a video-to-video relighting diffusion model into a 3D reconstruction. This side-steps the need to solve a difficult inverse rendering problem, and results in a flexible system that can relight 3D reconstructions of complex real-world scenes.

Although classical decision theories, such as the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), offer systematic rational frameworks, their construction relies heavily on labor-intensive domain expertise, creating an \"expert bottleneck\" that hinders scalability in general scenarios. To bridge the gap between the generalization capabilities of LLMs and the rigor of decision theory, we propose Doc2AHP, a novel structured inference framework guided by AHP principles. Eliminating the need for extensive annotated data or manual intervention, our approach leverages the structural principles of AHP as constraints to direct the LLM in a constrained search within the unstructured document space, thereby enforcing the logical entailment between parent and child nodes. Furthermore, we introduce a multi-agent weighting mechanism coupled with an adaptive consistency optimization strategy to ensure the numerical consistency of weight allocation. Empirical results demonstrate that Doc2AHP not only empowers non-expert users to construct high-quality decision models from scratch but also significantly outperforms direct generative baselines in both logical completeness and downstream task accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, real-world video editing is often an iterative process, where users refine results across multiple rounds of interaction. In this multi-turn setting, current video editors struggle to maintain cross-consistency across sequential edits. In this work, we tackle, for the first time, the problem of cross-consistency in multi-turn video editing and introduce Memory-V2V, a simple, yet effective framework that augments existing video-to-video models with explicit memory. Given an external cache of previously edited videos, Memory-V2V employs accurate retrieval and dynamic tokenization strategies to condition the current editing step on prior results. To further mitigate redundancy and computational overhead, we propose a learnable token compressor within the DiT backbone that compresses redundant conditioning tokens while preserving essential visual cues, achieving an overall speedup of 30%. We validate Memory-V2V on challenging tasks including video novel view synthesis and text-conditioned long video editing. Extensive experiments show that Memory-V2V produces videos that are significantly more cross-consistent with minimal computational overhead, while maintaining or even improving task-specific performance over state-of-the-art baselines.

To address the step-size constraint issue, we propose the switched \\mbox{step-size} FxNLMS (SSS-FxNLMS) algorithm. Specifically, we derive the \\mbox{mean-square} deviation (MSD) trend of the FxNLMS algorithm, and then by comparing the MSD trends corresponding to different \\mbox{step-sizes}, the optimal step-size for each iteration is selected. Furthermore, to enhance the algorithm's robustness in impulsive noise scenarios, we integrate a robust strategy into the SSS-FxNLMS algorithm, resulting in a robust variant of it.

Modeling, control, and optimization of such multi-domain systems play a critical role in achieving building-sector decarbonization. However, most existing tools lack scalability and physical consistency for addressing these complex, multi-scale ecosystem problems. To bridge this gap, this study presents BESTOpt, a modular, physics-informed machine learning (PIML) framework that unifies building applications, including benchmarking, evaluation, diagnostics, control, optimization, and performance simulation. The framework adopts a cluster-domain-system/building-component hierarchy and a standardized state-action-disturbance-observation data typology. By embedding physics priors into data-driven modules, BESTOpt improves model accuracy and physical consistency under unseen conditions. Case studies on single-building and cluster scenarios demonstrate its capability for multi-level centralized and decentralized control.

These applications require not only low latency and high data rates, but also consistent and high-quality User Experience (UX). Traditional rate allocation and congestion control mechanisms in wireless networks treat users uniformly based on channel conditions, rely only on network-centric Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), and ignore the content diversity, which can lead to inefficient resource utilization and degraded UX. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Multi-User Content Diversity, which recognizes that different users concurrently consume media with varying complexity, and therefore have different bitrate requirements to achieve satisfactory UX. We propose multiple different frameworks that exploit multi-user content diversity and lead to overall network-wide gains in terms of UX. For each framework, we demonstrate the required information exchange between Application Servers (ASs), Application Clients (ACs), and the network, and the algorithms that run in each of these components to optimize a network-wide UXbased objective. Simulation results demonstrate that exploiting multi-user content diversity leads to significant gains in UX capacity, UX fairness, and network utilization, when compared to conventional rate control methods. These findings highlight the potential of content-aware networking as a key enabler for emerging wireless systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In medical imagining applications the most coveted property for effective deployment is Single Domain Generalization (SDG), which addresses the challenge of training a model on a single domain to ensure it generalizes well to unseen target domains. In multi-center studies, differences in scanners and imaging protocols introduce domain shifts that exacerbate variability in rare class characteristics. This paper presents our experience on SDG in real life deployment for two exemplary medical imaging case studies on seizure onset zone detection using fMRI data, and stress electrocardiogram based coronary artery detection. Utilizing the commonly used application of diabetic retinopathy, we first demonstrate that state-of-the-art SDG techniques fail to achieve generalized performance across data domains. We then develop a generic expert knowledge integrated deep learning technique DL+EKE and instantiate it for the DR application and show that DL+EKE outperforms SOTA SDG methods on DR.

However, domain shifts and heterogeneity in data often lead to a degradation in model performance. Medical imaging applications are particularly affected by variations in acquisition protocols, scanner types, and patient populations. To address these issues, we introduce Federated Template and Task Learning (FeTTL), a novel framework designed to harmonize multi-institutional medical imaging data in federated environments. FeTTL learns a global template together with a task model to align data distributions among clients. We evaluated FeTTL on two challenging and diverse multi-institutional medical imaging tasks: retinal fundus optical disc segmentation and histopathological metastasis classification. Experimental results show that FeTTL significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art federated learning baselines (p-values <0.002) for optical disc segmentation and classification of metastases from multi-institutional data. Our experiments further highlight the importance of jointly learning the template and the task. These findings suggest that FeTTL offers a principled and extensible solution for mitigating distribution shifts in federated learning, supporting robust model deployment in real-world, multi-institutional environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aFeTTL\uff08\u8054\u90a6\u6a21\u677f\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7531\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u7597\u5f71\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u533b\u7597\u5f71\u50cf\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u533b\u7597\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5f80\u5f80\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff08\u5982\u91c7\u96c6\u534f\u8bae\u3001\u8bbe\u5907\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u75c5\u4eba\u7fa4\u4f53\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u9886\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "FeTTL\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u677f\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u4e60\u4e00\u4e2a\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8c03\u548c\u5404\u673a\u6784\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u591a\u673a\u6784\u533b\u7597\u5f71\u50cf\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u89c6\u76d8\u5206\u5272\u548c\u75c5\u7406\u6027\u8f6c\u79fb\u5206\u7c7b\uff09\u4e0a\uff0cFeTTL\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08p\u503c<0.002\uff09\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8fd8\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u677f\u4e0e\u4efb\u52a1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "FeTTL\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u652f\u6301\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u3001\u591a\u673a\u6784\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u3002"}}

In this paper, we construct two classes of LCD codes from the $(\\mathcal{L},\\mathcal{P})$-TGRS code $\\mathcal{C}_h$ of length $n$ and dimension $k$, where $\\mathcal{L}=\\{0,1,\\ldots,l\\}$ for $l\\leq n-k-1$ and $\\mathcal{P}=\\{h\\}$ for $1\\leq h\\leq k-1$. First, we derive the parity check matrix of $\\mathcal{C}_h$ and provide a necessary and sufficient condition for $\\mathcal{C}_h$ to be an AMDS code.

This work offers a rigorous, unified benchmark by using four publicly available datasets covering text and image modalities (binary and multiclass complexity) that contrasts traditional Machine Learning (ML) with contemporary transformer-based techniques. We evaluated three model classes for each task: Classical ML (LR, LightGBM, ResNet-50), Prompt-Based LLMs/VLMs (Gemini 2.5), and Fine-Tuned PEFT Models (LoRA-adapted Gemma3 variants). All experiments used consistent data splits and aligned metrics. According to our results, traditional machine learning (ML) models set a high standard by consistently achieving the best overall performance across most medical categorization tasks. This was especially true for structured text-based datasets, where the classical models performed exceptionally well. In stark contrast, the LoRA-tuned Gemma variants consistently showed the worst performance across all text and image experiments, failing to generalize from the minimal fine-tuning provided. However, the zero-shot LLM/VLM pipelines (Gemini 2.5) had mixed results; they performed poorly on text-based tasks, but demonstrated competitive performance on the multiclass image task, matching the classical ResNet-50 baseline. These results demonstrate that in many medical categorization scenarios, established machine learning models continue to be the most reliable option. The experiment suggests that foundation models are not universally superior and that the effectiveness of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is highly dependent on the adaptation strategy, as minimal fine-tuning proved detrimental in this study.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

On the Ability of Foundation Models to Recognize Contextually Important Moments", "comment": null, "summary": "Foundation models are used for many real-world applications involving language generation from temporally-ordered multimodal events. In this work, we study the ability of models to identify the most important sub-events in a video, which is a fundamental prerequisite for narrating or summarizing multimodal events. Specifically, we focus on football games and evaluate models on their ability to distinguish between important and non-important sub-events in a game. To this end, we construct a new dataset by leveraging human preferences for importance implicit in football game highlight reels, without any additional annotation costs. Using our dataset, which we will publicly release to the community, we compare several state-of-the-art multimodal models and show that they are not far from chance level performance. Analyses of models beyond standard evaluation metrics reveal their tendency to rely on a single dominant modality and their ineffectiveness in synthesizing necessary information from multiple sources.

While Network Digital Twins (NDTs) offer a pathway to such predictive capabilities, existing solutions typically struggle to reconcile high-fidelity physical modeling with strict real-time constraints. This paper presents a novel, end-to-end real-time V2X Digital Twin framework that integrates live mobility tracking with deterministic channel simulation. By coupling the Tokyo Mobility Digital Twin-which provides live sensing and trajectory forecasting-with VaN3Twin-a full-stack simulator with ray tracing-we enable the prediction of network performance before physical events occur. We validate this approach through an experimental proof-of-concept deployed in Tokyo, Japan, featuring connected vehicles operating on 60 GHz links. Our results demonstrate the system's ability to predict Received Signal Strength (RSSI) with a maximum average error of 1.01 dB and reliably forecast Line-of-Sight (LoS) transitions within a maximum average end-to-end system latency of 250 ms, depending on the ray tracing level of detail. Furthermore, we quantify the fundamental trade-offs between digital model fidelity, computational latency, and trajectory prediction horizons, proving that high-fidelity and predictive digital twins are feasible in real-world urban environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To overcome this problem, we propose a new unsupervised training strategy for the super-resolution of hyperspectral remote sensing images, based on the use of synthetic abundance data. Its first step decomposes the hyperspectral image into abundances and endmembers by unmixing. Then, an abundance super-resolution neural network is trained using synthetic abundances, which are generated using the dead leaves model in such a way as to faithfully mimic real abundance statistics. Next, the spatial resolution of the considered hyperspectral image abundances is increased using this trained network, and the high resolution hyperspectral image is finally obtained by recombination with the endmembers.

For a comprehensive analysis, the multi-modal images require pixel-wise alignment, which is still often performed manually. Multi-modal image registration can reduce this laborious manual work, is substantially faster, and enables higher precision. Due to varying image resolutions, huge image sizes, non-rigid distortions, and modality-dependent image content, registration is challenging. Therefore, we propose a coarse-to-fine non-rigid multi-modal registration method efficiently relying on sparse keypoints and thin-plate-splines. Historical paintings exhibit a fine crack pattern, called craquelure, on the paint layer, which is captured by all image systems and is well-suited as a feature for registration. In our one-stage non-rigid registration approach, we employ a convolutional neural network for joint keypoint detection and description based on the craquelure and a graph neural network for descriptor matching in a patch-based manner, and filter matches based on homography reprojection errors in local areas. For coarse-to-fine registration, we introduce a novel multi-level keypoint refinement approach to register mixed-resolution images up to the highest resolution. We created a multi-modal dataset of panel paintings with a high number of keypoint annotations, and a large test set comprising five multi-modal domains and varying image resolutions. The ablation study demonstrates the effectiveness of all modules of our refinement method. Our proposed approaches achieve the best registration results compared to competing keypoint and dense matching methods and refinement methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Understanding the NN data flow provides a tool for symbolic NN analysis, e.g.,~robustness analysis or model repair. Unlike the standard approach to NN data flow analysis, which is based on information theory, we employ the notion of graph curvature, specifically Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC). The ORC has been successfully used to identify important graph edges in various domains such as road traffic analysis, biological and social networks. In particular, edges with negative ORC are considered bottlenecks and as such are critical to the graph's overall connectivity, whereas positive-ORC edges are not essential. We use this intuition for the case of NNs as well: we 1)~construct a graph induced by the NN structure and introduce the notion of neural curvature (NC) based on the ORC; 2)~calculate curvatures based on activation patterns for a set of input examples; 3)~aim to demonstrate that NC can indeed be used to rank edges according to their importance for the overall NN functionality. We evaluate our method through pruning experiments and show that removing negative-ORC edges quickly degrades the overall NN performance, whereas positive-ORC edges have little impact. The proposed method is evaluated on a variety of models trained on three image datasets, namely MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100. The results indicate that our method can identify a larger number of unimportant edges as compared to state-of-the-art pruning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Conventional uninterruptible power supply (UPS) based AC distribution chains involve multiple conversion stages and line-frequency transformers, which compound losses and are less compatible with dynamic AI power profiles. Although solid-state transformers (SSTs) and 800 VDC distribution architecture are widely discussed, implementable topology/control details, and long-horizon validation with realistic operating profiles remain limited. This paper develops an SST-driven 800 VDC architecture that converts 10 kV MVAC to an 800V LVDC bus using a three-phase H-bridge AC/DC stage cascaded with a dual-active-bridge (DAB) DC/DC stage. A coordinated closed-loop control scheme, combining rectifier voltage/current regulation and DAB phase-shift control, is designed to maintain DC-bus voltage stability. The proposed system is implemented on the real-time digital simulation (RTDS) platform and evaluated via sequential simulations using real-world day- and month-scale operating profiles of data centers, benchmarked against a UPS supply chain. Numerical studies demonstrate tight 800 VDC regulation, reduced input-side energy consumption compared with the UPS baseline, and satisfactory power-quality performance. A capacitance sensitivity test quantifies tradeoffs between DC-bus ripple and low-frequency input-power oscillations, yielding a practical capacitance range for design.

It targets low-latency, resource-constrained applications with large data volumes, requiring tight integration of wireless access and on-site computing. Yet system performance and cost-efficiency hinge on joint pre-deployment dimensioning of radio and computational resources, especially under spatial and temporal uncertainty. Prior work largely emphasizes run-time allocation or relies on simplified models that decouple radio and computing, missing end-to-end correlations in large-scale deployments. This paper introduces a unified stochastic framework to dimension multi-cell edge-intelligent systems. We model network topology with Poisson point processes, capturing random user and base-station locations, inter-cell interference, distance-based fractional power control, and peak-power constraints. By combining this with queueing theory and empirical AI inference workload profiling, we derive tractable expressions for end-to-end offloading delay. These enable a non-convex joint optimization that minimizes deployment cost under statistical QoS guarantees, expressed through strict tail-latency and inference-accuracy constraints. We prove the problem decomposes into convex subproblems, yielding global optimality. Numerical results in noise- and interference-limited regimes identify cost-efficient design regions and configurations that cause under-utilization or user unfairness. Smaller cells reduce transmission delay but raise per-request computing cost due to weaker server multiplexing, whereas larger cells show the opposite trend.

These errors reflect a persistent egocentric bias and raise questions about whether current models support allocentric reasoning. Inspired by human spatial cognition, we introduce perspective tokens, specialized embeddings that encode orientation through either (1) embodied body-keypoint cues or (2) abstract representations supporting mental rotation. Integrating these tokens into LLaVA-1.5-13B yields performance on level-2 visual perspective-taking tasks. Across synthetic and naturalistic benchmarks (Isle Bricks V2, COCO, 3DSRBench), perspective tokens improve accuracy, with rotation-based tokens generalizing to non-human reference agents. Representational analyses reveal that fine-tuning enhances latent orientation sensitivity already present in the base model, suggesting that MLMs contain precursors of allocentric reasoning but lack appropriate internal structure. Overall, embedding cognitively grounded spatial structure directly into token space provides a lightweight, model-agnostic mechanism for perspective-taking and more human-like spatial reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165'\u89c6\u89d2\u4ee4\u724c'\u673a\u5236\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u89c6\u89d2\u91c7\u7eb3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9700\u8981\u91c7\u7eb3\u5176\u4ed6\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u89c6\u89d2\u8fdb\u884c\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u987d\u56fa\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u652f\u6301\u975e\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7591\u95ee\u3002\u672c\u6587\u53d7\u5230\u4eba\u7c7b\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ba4\u77e5\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u8f7b\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u673a\u5236\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u91c7\u7eb3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u89c6\u89d2\u4ee4\u724c\u2014\u2014\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u5411\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u5177\u8eab\u4f53\u5173\u952e\u70b9\u7ebf\u7d22\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u652f\u6301\u5fc3\u7406\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u8868\u793a\u3002\u5c06\u8fd9\u79cd\u4ee4\u724c\u96c6\u6210\u5230LLaVA-1.5-13B\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u81ea\u7136\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08Isle Bricks V2\u3001COCO\u30013DSRBench\uff09\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u89c6\u89d2\u4ee4\u724c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4e8c\u7ea7\u89c6\u89c9\u89c6\u89d2\u91c7\u7eb3\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u65cb\u8f6c\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u80fd\u591f\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u975e\u4eba\u7c7b\u53c2\u8003\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002\u8868\u5f81\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5fae\u8c03\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u65b9\u5411\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u5305\u542b\u975e\u81ea\u6211\u4e2d\u5fc3\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u96cf\u5f62\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9002\u5f53\u5185\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u76f4\u63a5\u5c06\u8ba4\u77e5\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5d4c\u5165\u4ee4\u724c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u89d2\u91c7\u7eb3\u548c\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u4eba\u7c7b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

The upper-level decision variable parameterizes the reward of the lower-level MDP, and the upper-level objective depends on the optimal induced policy. Existing methods for bi-level optimization and RL often require second-order information, impose strong regularization at the lower level, or inefficiently use samples through nested-loop procedures. In this work, we propose a single-loop, first-order actor-critic algorithm that optimizes the bi-level objective via a penalty-based reformulation. We introduce into the lower-level RL objective an attenuating entropy regularization, which enables asymptotically unbiased upper-level hyper-gradient estimation without solving the unregularized RL problem exactly. We establish the finite-time and finite-sample convergence of the proposed algorithm to a stationary point of the original, unregularized bi-level optimization problem through a novel lower-level residual analysis under a special type of Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition.

A central practical challenge is resolving the trade-off between reconstruction faithfulness and photorealism. To address inference efficiency, many recent works have explored knowledge distillation strategies specifically tailored to SR, enabling one-step diffusion-based approaches. However, these teacher-student formulations are inherently constrained by information compression, which can degrade perceptual cues such as lifelike textures and depth of field, even with high overall perceptual quality. In parallel, self-distillation DMs, known as Flow Map models, have emerged as a promising alternative for image generation tasks, enabling fast inference while preserving the expressivity and training stability of standard DMs. Building on these developments, we propose FlowMapSR, a novel diffusion-based framework for image super-resolution explicitly designed for efficient inference. Beyond adapting Flow Map models to SR, we introduce two complementary enhancements: (i) positive-negative prompting guidance, based on a generalization of classifier free-guidance paradigm to Flow Map models, and (ii) adversarial fine-tuning using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Among the considered Flow Map formulations (Eulerian, Lagrangian, and Shortcut), we find that the Shortcut variant consistently achieves the best performance when combined with these enhancements. Extensive experiments show that FlowMapSR achieves a better balance between reconstruction faithfulness and photorealism than recent state-of-the-art methods for both x4 and x8 upscaling, while maintaining competitive inference time. Notably, a single model is used for both upscaling factors, without any scale-specific conditioning or degradation-guided mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "FlowMapSR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7167\u7247\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u7167\u7247\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u4e4b\u95f4\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e14\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u635f\u5931\u611f\u77e5\u7ebf\u7d22\u5982\u771f\u5b9e\u7eb9\u7406\u548c\u666f\u6df1\u7b49\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u7684Flow Map\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efaFlowMapSR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u589e\u5f3a\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u81ea\u7531\u5f15\u5bfc\u8303\u5f0f\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u6b63\u8d1f\u63d0\u793a\u5f15\u5bfc\uff1b2\uff09\u4f7f\u7528LoRA\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6297\u5fae\u8c03\u3002\u5728Eulerian\u3001Lagrangian\u548cShortcut\u4e09\u79cdFlow Map\u53d8\u4f53\u4e2d\uff0cShortcut\u53d8\u4f53\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFlowMapSR\u5728x4\u548cx8\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7167\u7247\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u3002\u4e00\u4e2a\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u4e24\u79cd\u7f29\u653e\u56e0\u5b50\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7279\u5b9a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u6216\u9000\u5316\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "FlowMapSR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u6269\u6563\u5f0f\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on a wide range of agentic benchmarks, including agentic search, agentic tool use, and tool-integrated reasoning. Beyond benchmark performance, the model demonstrates strong generalization to complex tool interactions and robust behavior under noisy real-world environments. Its advanced capability stems from a unified training framework that combines domain-parallel expert training with subsequent fusion, together with an end-to-end co-design of data construction, environments, algorithms, and infrastructure spanning from pre-training to post-training. In particular, the model's strong generalization capability in complex tool-use are driven by our in-depth exploration of environment scaling and principled task construction. To optimize long-tailed, skewed generation and multi-turn agentic interactions, and to enable stable training across over 10,000 environments spanning more than 20 domains, we systematically extend our asynchronous reinforcement learning framework, DORA, for stable and efficient large-scale multi-environment training. Furthermore, recognizing that real-world tasks are inherently noisy, we conduct a systematic analysis and decomposition of real-world noise patterns, and design targeted training procedures to explicitly incorporate such imperfections into the training process, resulting in improved robustness for real-world applications. To further enhance performance on complex reasoning tasks, we introduce a Heavy Thinking mode that enables effective test-time scaling by jointly expanding reasoning depth and width through intensive parallel thinking.", "AI": {"tldr": "LongCat-Flash-Thinking-2601 \u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u79c0\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u3001\u591a\u73af\u5883\u566a\u58f0\u4ee5\u53ca\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\u4e0e\u7edf\u4e00\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u9886\u57df\u5e76\u884c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u73af\u5883\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u5f02\u6b65\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08DORA\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u9488\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u7684Heavy Thinking\u6a21\u5f0f", "result": "\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u641c\u7d22\u3001\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u96c6\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u5177\u4ea4\u4e92\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u7efc\u5408\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7a81\u7834\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

However, practical implementations of DNA storage are constrained by errors introduced during synthesis, preservation, and sequencing processes, and traditional error-correcting codes remain vulnerable to noise levels that exceed predefined thresholds. Here, we developed a Partitioning-mapping with Jump-rotating (PJ) encoding scheme, which exhibits exceptional noise resilience. PJ removes cross-strand information dependencies so that strand loss manifests as localized gaps rather than catastrophic file failure. It prioritizes file decodability under arbitrary noise conditions and leverages AI-based inference to enable controllable recovery of digital information. For the intra-strand encoding, we develop a jump-rotating strategy that relaxes sequence constraints relative to conventional rotating codes and provides tunable information density via an adjustable jump length. Based on this encoding architecture, the original file information can always be decoded and recovered under any strand loss ratio, with fidelity degrading smoothly as damage increases. We demonstrate that original files can be effectively recovered even with 10% strand loss, and machine learning datasets stored under these conditions retain their classification performance. Experiments further confirmed that PJ successfully decodes image files after extreme environmental disturbance using accelerated aging and high-intensity X-ray irradiation. By eliminating reliance on prior error probabilities, PJ establishes a general framework for robust, archival DNA storage capable of withstanding the rigorous conditions of real-world preservation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PJ\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3DNA\u5b58\u50a8\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u6570\u636e\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u90fd\u80fd\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u6062\u590d\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u65f6\u4ee3\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\uff0cDNA\u5b58\u50a8\u6210\u4e3a\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u5408\u6210\u3001\u4fdd\u5b58\u548c\u6d4b\u5e8f\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7ea0\u9519\u7801\u5728\u8d85\u51fa\u9884\u8bbe\u9608\u503c\u7684\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\u4ecd\u7136\u8106\u5f31\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86PJ\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6253\u7834\u8de8\u94fe\u4fe1\u606f\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff08\u9632\u6b62\u94fe\u4e22\u5931\u5bfc\u81f4\u707e\u96be\u6027\u6545\u969c\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u94fe\u5185\u8df3\u8f6c\u65cb\u8f6c\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u653e\u677e\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u8c03\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8eAI\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u4fe1\u606f\u6062\u590d\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86PJ\u7f16\u7801\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u94fe\u4e22\u5931\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e0b\u59cb\u7ec8\u89e3\u7801\u539f\u59cb\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u968f\u635f\u574f\u7a0b\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u670910%\u94fe\u4e22\u5931\u4e5f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d\u539f\u59cb\u6587\u4ef6\uff0c\u5b58\u50a8\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4fdd\u6301\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u7ecf\u52a0\u901f\u8001\u5316\u548c\u9ad8\u5f3a\u5ea6X\u5c04\u7ebf\u8f90\u7167\u7b49\u6781\u7aef\u73af\u5883\u5e72\u6270\u540e\u4ecd\u80fd\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u7801\u56fe\u50cf\u6587\u4ef6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6d88\u9664\u5bf9\u5148\u9a8c\u9519\u8bef\u6982\u7387\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0cPJ\u4e3a\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5f52\u6863DNA\u5b58\u50a8\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u627f\u53d7\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4fdd\u5b58\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u6761\u4ef6\u3002"}}

Despite the progress of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based approaches, existing RES methods still suffer from two key limitations: first, the coarse bounding boxes from MLLMs lead to redundant or non-discriminative point prompts; second, the prevalent reliance on textual coordinate reasoning is unreliable, as it fails to distinguish targets from visually similar distractors. To address these issues, we propose \\textbf{\\model}, a novel RES framework integrating \\textbf{E}ntropy-\\textbf{B}ased Point \\textbf{D}iscovery (\\textbf{EBD}) and \\textbf{V}ision-\\textbf{B}ased \\textbf{R}easoning (\\textbf{VBR}). Specifically, EBD identifies high-information candidate points by modeling spatial uncertainty within coarse bounding boxes, treating point selection as an information maximization process. VBR verifies point correctness through joint visual-semantic alignment, abandoning text-only coordinate inference for more robust validation.

Extreme class imbalance biases conventional models toward majority-class predictions, limiting recall, calibration, and operational usefulness. We propose LPCORP (Low-Prevalence CORrector for Prediction)*, a two-stage framework that combines reasoningenhanced prediction with confidence-based outcome correction. A reasoning model first produces enriched predictions from narrative inputs, after which a lightweight logistic-regression classifier evaluates and selectively corrects these outputs to mitigate prevalence-driven bias. We evaluate LPCORP on real-world datasets from medical and consumer service domains. The results show that this method transforms a highly imbalanced setting into a well-balanced one while preserving the original number of samples and without applying any resampling strategies. Test-set evaluation demonstrates substantially improved performance, particularly in precision, which is a known weakness in low-prevalence data. We further provide a costreduction analysis comparing the expenses associated with rare-event damage control without preventive measures to those incurred when low-cost, prediction-based preventive interventions are applied that showed more than 50% reduction in some cases. * Patent pending: U.S. Provisional 63/933,518, filed 8 December 2025.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLPCORP\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u6781\u7aef\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u5148\u7528\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u4e30\u5bcc\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u7a00\u6709\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u5728\u533b\u7597\u3001\u91d1\u878d\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5de5\u7a0b\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u6781\u5ea6\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u4f1a\u4f7f\u4f20\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u5411\u591a\u6570\u7c7b\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u3001\u6821\u51c6\u5ea6\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "LPCORP\u662f\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u53d9\u8ff0\u8f93\u5165\u4ea7\u751f\u4e30\u5bcc\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b2\uff09\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u8bc4\u4f30\u5e76\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u6821\u6b63\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f93\u51fa\u4ee5\u51cf\u8f7b\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u9a71\u52a8\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u8bbe\u7f6e\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u5e73\u8861\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u6837\u672c\u6570\u91cf\u4e14\u4e0d\u5e94\u7528\u4efb\u4f55\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u9884\u8ba1\u51cf\u5c1150%\u4ee5\u4e0a\u7684\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "LPCORP\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f4e\u6d41\u884c\u5ea6\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u504f\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6821\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6837\u672c\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The main basic contribution is in defining a notion of a Kraft matrix and in establishing the fact that a necessary condition for information losslessness of a finite-state encoder is that none of the eigenvalues of this matrix have modulus larger than unity, or equivalently, the generalized Kraft inequality asserts that the spectral radius of the Kraft matrix cannot exceed one. For the important special case where the FS encoder is irreducible, we derive several equivalent forms of this inequality, which are based on well known formulas for spectral radius. It also turns out that in the irreducible case, Kraft sums are bounded by a constant, independent of the block length, and thus cannot grow even in any subexponential rate. Finally, two extensions are outlined - one concerns the case of side information available to both encoder and decoder, and the other is for lossy compression.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We translate this dual-system mechanism into a cue-guided RL framework in which radio-frequency (RF) stimuli act as conditioned (Pavlovian) cues that modulate action selection. The proposed architecture combines Pavlovian values with instrumental policy optimization, improving navigation efficiency and cooperative behavior in unknown, partially observable environments.

This paper examines the behavior of such reasoning models in ToM tasks, using novel adaptations of machine psychological experiments and results from established benchmarks. We observe that reasoning models consistently exhibit increased robustness to prompt variations and task perturbations.

However, preserving the effectiveness of the obtained structural information is important in image super-resolution. In this paper, we propose a cosine network for image super-resolution (CSRNet) by improving a network architecture and optimizing the training strategy. To extract complementary homologous structural information, odd and even heterogeneous blocks are designed to enlarge the architectural differences and improve the performance of image super-resolution. Combining linear and non-linear structural information can overcome the drawback of homologous information and enhance the robustness of the obtained structural information in image super-resolution. Taking into account the local minimum of gradient descent, a cosine annealing mechanism is used to optimize the training procedure by performing warm restarts and adjusting the learning rate. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed CSRNet is competitive with state-of-the-art methods in image super-resolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Attempts were made by Mow over 30 years ago, but a comprehensive understanding to this problem is lacking. Our first key contribution is an explicit upper bound of generalized quadratic Gauss sums which is obtained by recursively applying Paris' asymptotic expansion and then bounding it by leveraging the fast convergence property of the Fibonacci zeta function. Building upon this major finding, our second key contribution includes four systematic constructions of order-optimal sequence sets with low aperiodic correlation and/or ambiguity properties via carefully selected Chu sequences and Alltop sequences. For the first time in the literature, we reveal that the full Alltop sequence set is asymptotically optimal for its low aperiodic correlation sidelobes. Besides, we introduce a novel subset of Alltop sequences possessing both order-optimal aperiodic correlation and ambiguity properties for the entire time-shift window.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6ee1\u8db3Welch\u754c\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u6700\u4f18\u975e\u5468\u671f\u591a\u76f8\u5e8f\u5217\u96c6\u7684\u957f\u671f\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5e7f\u4e49\u4e8c\u6b21\u9ad8\u65af\u548c\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u56db\u7c7b\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u975e\u5468\u671f\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u5e8f\u5217\u96c6\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u6ee1\u8db3Welch\u754c\u7684\u6e10\u8fdb\u6700\u4f18\u975e\u5468\u671f\u591a\u76f8\u5e8f\u5217\u96c6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u867d\u7136Mow\u572830\u5e74\u524d\u5c1d\u8bd5\u8fc7\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5168\u9762\u7406\u89e3\u4ecd\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u57fa\u7840\u7406\u8bba\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1) \u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u5e94\u7528\u5df4\u9ece\u6e10\u8fd1\u5c55\u5f00\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6590\u6ce2\u90a3\u5951zeta\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u6027\uff0c\u5f97\u5230\u5e7f\u4e49\u4e8c\u6b21\u9ad8\u65af\u548c\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u4e0a\u754c\u30022) \u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u9009\u62e9Chu\u5e8f\u5217\u548cAlltop\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u9020\u4e86\u56db\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u4f4e\u975e\u5468\u671f\u76f8\u5173\u548c/\u6216\u6a21\u7cca\u7279\u6027\u7684\u9636\u6700\u4f18\u5e8f\u5217\u96c6\u3002", "result": "1) \u9996\u6b21\u63ed\u793a\u5b8c\u6574\u7684Alltop\u5e8f\u5217\u96c6\u5728\u4f4e\u975e\u5468\u671f\u76f8\u5173\u65c1\u74e3\u65b9\u9762\u662f\u6e10\u8fdb\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u30022) \u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Alltop\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u65b0\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u6574\u6bb5\u65f6\u95f4\u504f\u79fb\u7a97\u53e3\u5185\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u6709\u9636\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u975e\u5468\u671f\u76f8\u5173\u7279\u6027\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u975e\u5468\u671f\u591a\u76f8\u5e8f\u5217\u96c6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0Welch\u754c\u903c\u8fd1\u7684\u5e8f\u5217\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Alltop\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u7a81\u7834\u6027\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

However, existing methods often struggle with inadequate joint modeling of local-global features (harming target-background discrimination) or feature redundancy and semantic dilution (degrading target representation quality). To tackle these issues, we propose DCCS-Det (Directional Context and Cross-Scale Aware Detector for Infrared Small Target), a novel detector that incorporates a Dual-stream Saliency Enhancement (DSE) block and a Latent-aware Semantic Extraction and Aggregation (LaSEA) module. The DSE block integrates localized perception with direction-aware context aggregation to help capture long-range spatial dependencies and local details. On this basis, the LaSEA module mitigates feature degradation via cross-scale feature extraction and random pooling sampling strategies, enhancing discriminative features and suppressing noise. Extensive experiments show that DCCS-Det achieves state-of-the-art detection accuracy with competitive efficiency across multiple datasets. Ablation studies further validate the contributions of DSE and LaSEA in improving target perception and feature representation under complex scenarios. \\href{https://huggingface.co/InPeerReview/InfraredSmallTargetDetection-IRSTD.DCCS}{DCCS-Det Official Code is Available Here!}", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDCCS-Det\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6d41\u663e\u8457\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u8bed\u4e49\u63d0\u53d6\u805a\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u89e3\u51b3\u7ea2\u5916\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u5c40\u90e8-\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\u5173\u8054\u4e0d\u8db3\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7ea2\u5916\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c40\u90e8-\u5168\u5c40\u7279\u5f81\u8054\u5408\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0d\u8db3\uff08\u5f71\u54cd\u76ee\u6807-\u80cc\u666f\u533a\u5206\uff09\u6216\u5b58\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u5197\u4f59\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7a00\u91ca\uff08\u964d\u4f4e\u76ee\u6807\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\uff09\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u521b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDCCS-Det\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a1\uff09\u53cc\u6d41\u663e\u8457\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u5c40\u90e8\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u65b9\u5411\u611f\u77e5\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u805a\u5408\uff1b2\uff09\u6f5c\u5728\u611f\u77e5\u8bed\u4e49\u63d0\u53d6\u805a\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u968f\u673a\u6c60\u5316\u91c7\u6837\u7f13\u89e3\u7279\u5f81\u9000\u5316", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86DSE\u548cLaSEA\u6a21\u5757\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u8d21\u732e", "conclusion": "DCCS-Det\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7ea2\u5916\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4f4e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5ea6\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u521b\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4ee3\u7801\u5df2\u5f00\u6e90"}}

A key challenge is how to better represent the relationships among students, questions, and knowledge concepts (KCs). Recently, graph-based KT paradigms have shown promise for this problem. However, existing methods have not sufficiently explored inter-concept relations, often inferred solely from interaction sequences. In addition, the scale and heterogeneity of KT graphs make full-graph encoding both computationally both costly and noise-prone, causing attention to bleed into student-irrelevant regions and degrading the fidelity of inter-KC relations. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework: Multi-Agent Graph-Enhanced Knowledge Tracing (MAGE-KT). It constructs a multi-view heterogeneous graph by combining a multi-agent KC relation extractor and a student-question interaction graph, capturing complementary semantic and behavioral signals. Conditioned on the target student's history, it retrieves compact, high-value subgraphs and integrates them using an Asymmetric Cross-attention Fusion Module to enhance prediction while avoiding attention diffusion and irrelevant computation. Experiments on three widely used KT datasets show substantial improvements in KC-relation accuracy and clear gains in next-question prediction over existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To improve facial pose robustness, explicit geometric features are applied, but this approach remains problematic since it introduces additional dependencies and increases computational cost. Diffusion-based methods have achieved remarkable results; however, they are impractical for real-time processing. We introduce AlphaFace, which leverages an open-source vision-language model and CLIP image and text embeddings to apply novel visual and textual semantic contrastive losses.

While Bayesian experimental design (BED) provides a principled, information-based framework that integrates experimental planning with probabilistic inference, the selection of utility functions in BED is a long-standing and active topic, where different criteria emphasize different notions of information. Although Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence has been one of the most common choices, recent studies have proposed Wasserstein distance as an alternative. In this work, we first employ a toy example to illustrate an issue of Wasserstein distance - the value of Wasserstein distance of a fixed-shape posterior depends on the relative position of its main mass within the support and can exhibit false rewards unrelated to information gain, especially with a non-informative prior (e.g., uniform distribution). We then further provide a systematic comparison between these two criteria through a classical source inversion problem in the BED literature, revealing that the KL divergence tends to lead to faster convergence in the absence of model discrepancy, while Wasserstein metrics provide more robust sequential BED results if model discrepancy is non-negligible. These findings clarify the trade-offs between KL divergence and Wasserstein metrics for the utility function and provide guidelines for selecting suitable criteria in practical BED applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u6bd4KL\u6563\u5ea6\u548cWasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5404\u81ea\u7684\u9002\u7528\u573a\u666f\uff1aKL\u6563\u5ea6\u5728\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u914d\u65f6\u6536\u655b\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u800cWasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u5728\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u914d\u65f6\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5e8f\u8d2fBED\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9009\u62e9\u6307\u5357\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u8ba1(BED)\u4e2d\u957f\u671f\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u867d\u7136KL\u6563\u5ea6\u4e00\u76f4\u662f\u5e38\u89c1\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd1\u5e74\u6765Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u88ab\u63d0\u51fa\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u865a\u5047\u5956\u52b1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u793a\u4f8b\u8bf4\u660eWasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u56fa\u5b9a\u5f62\u72b6\u540e\u9a8c\u7684Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u503c\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u5176\u4e3b\u8981\u8d28\u91cf\u5728\u652f\u6491\u96c6\u5185\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0e\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u865a\u5047\u5956\u52b1\uff1b2. \u901a\u8fc7BED\u6587\u732e\u4e2d\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u6e90\u53cd\u6f14\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u79cd\u51c6\u5219\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5173\u6ce8\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u914d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "1. \u5728\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u914d\u65f6\uff0cKL\u6563\u5ea6\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5bfc\u81f4\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\uff1b2. \u5f53\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u914d\u4e0d\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u65f6\uff0cWasserstein\u5ea6\u91cf\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5e8f\u8d2fBED\u7ed3\u679c\uff1b3. \u63ed\u793a\u4e86KL\u6563\u5ea6\u548cWasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u6743\u8861\u53d6\u820d\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u9610\u660e\u4e86KL\u6563\u5ea6\u548cWasserstein\u5ea6\u91cf\u5728\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u9009\u62e9\u4e2d\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645BED\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9009\u62e9\u5408\u9002\u51c6\u5219\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u660e\u786e\u6307\u5bfc\uff1a\u6839\u636e\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u6a21\u578b\u5931\u914d\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u6548\u7528\u51fd\u6570\u6807\u51c6\u3002"}}

We formulate the system as an impulse-controlled piecewise-deterministic Markov process (PDMP) and derive coupled integral average-cost optimality equations via the dynamic programming principle, thereby avoiding the smoothness assumptions typically required for an average-cost Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman quasi-variational inequality (HJB-QVI) characterization. A key invariance in the busy phase collapses the dynamics onto a one-dimensional busy-start boundary, reducing preemption control to an optimal stopping problem. Building on this structure, we develop an efficient policy iteration algorithm with heavy-tail acceleration, employing a hybrid (uniform/log-spaced) action grid and a far-field linear closure. Simulations under Pareto and log-normal service times demonstrate substantial improvements over AoI-optimal non-preemptive sampling and zero-wait baselines, achieving up to a 30x reduction in average cost in heavy-tailed regimes. Finally, simulations uncover a counterintuitive insight: under preemption, delay variance, despite typically being a liability, can become a strategic advantage for information freshness.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We further apply our construction to analyze the PIR properties of the considered MDS matrices and present a one-step majority-logic decoding algorithm with strong error-correcting capability.

However, determining the required network complexity to ensure closed-loop performance remains a fundamental open problem. This involves a critical precision-complexity trade-off: undersized networks may fail to capture the MPC policy, while oversized ones may outweigh the benefits of ReLU network approximation. In this work, we propose a projection-based method to enforce hard constraints and establish a state-dependent Lipschitz continuity property for the optimal MPC cost function, which enables sharp convergence analysis of the closed-loop system. For the first time, we derive explicit bounds on ReLU network width and depth for approximating MPC policies with guaranteed closed-loop performance. To further reduce network complexity and enhance closed-loop performance, we propose a non-uniform error framework with a state-aware scaling function to adaptively adjust both the input and output of the ReLU network.

Current terminal benchmarks were built for evaluation, not training; reinforcement learning requires a scalable pipeline, not just a dataset. We introduce Endless Terminals, a fully autonomous pipeline that procedurally generates terminal-use tasks without human annotation. The pipeline has four stages: generating diverse task descriptions, building and validating containerized environments, producing completion tests, and filtering for solvability. From this pipeline we obtain 3255 tasks spanning file operations, log management, data processing, scripting, and database operations. We train agents using vanilla PPO with binary episode level rewards and a minimal interaction loop: no retrieval, multi-agent coordination, or specialized tools.

Such systems are commonly formulated as differential-algebraic equations (DAEs), which describe both the dynamic evolution of system states and the algebraic relations that must hold among them. Within this class, port-Hamiltonian differential-algebraic equations (pH-DAEs) offer a structured, energy-based representation that preserves interconnection and passivity properties. This work introduces a data-driven identification method that combines port-Hamiltonian neural networks (pHNNs) with a differential-algebraic solver to model such constrained systems directly from noisy input-output data. The approach preserves the passivity and interconnection structure of port-Hamiltonian systems while employing a backward Euler discretization with Newton's method to solve the coupled differential and algebraic equations consistently. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated on a DC power network, where the identified model accurately captures system behaviour and maintains errors proportional to the noise amplitude, while providing reliable parameter estimates.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing LLM-based agents often fail at genuine geospatial computation, relying instead on web search or pattern matching while hallucinating spatial relationships. We present Spatial-Agent, an AI agent grounded in foundational theories of spatial information science. Our approach formalizes geo-analytical question answering as a concept transformation problem, where natural-language questions are parsed into executable workflows represented as GeoFlow Graphs -- directed acyclic graphs with nodes corresponding to spatial concepts and edges representing transformations. Drawing on spatial information theory, Spatial-Agent extracts spatial concepts, assigns functional roles with principled ordering constraints, and composes transformation sequences through template-based generation. Extensive experiments on MapEval-API and MapQA benchmarks demonstrate that Spatial-Agent significantly outperforms existing baselines including ReAct and Reflexion, while producing interpretable and executable geospatial workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In collector cables connecting wind turbines to offshore MMC, both ends are supplied by Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs), which modify the magnitude and characteristics of fault currents. In this context, this paper investigates the limitations of conventional differential protection schemes under such conditions and compares them with enhanced strategies that account for sequence components. Using electromagnetic transient simulations of a representative offshore wind farm modeled in PSCAD/EMTDC software, internal and external fault scenarios are assessed, varying fault types and resistances.

The system integrates a large language model (LLM) with a user-friendly web interface, enabling imaging technologists/radiographers and biomedical technicians to input error codes or device symptoms and receive accurate, step-by-step troubleshooting guidance. The platform also includes a global peer-to-peer discussion forum to support knowledge exchange and provide additional context for rare or undocumented issues. A proof of concept was developed using the Philips HDI 5000 ultrasound machine, achieving 100% precision in error code interpretation and 80% accuracy in suggesting corrective actions. This study demonstrates the feasibility and potential of AI-driven systems to support medical device maintenance, with the aim of reducing equipment downtime to improve healthcare delivery in resource-constrained environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recent segmentation foundation models have improved generalization through large-scale pretraining, yet remain poorly aligned with pathology because they treat segmentation as a static visual prediction task. Here we present VISTA-PATH, an interactive, class-aware pathology segmentation foundation model designed to resolve heterogeneous structures, incorporate expert feedback, and produce pixel-level segmentation that are directly meaningful for clinical interpretation. VISTA-PATH jointly conditions segmentation on visual context, semantic tissue descriptions, and optional expert-provided spatial prompts, enabling precise multi-class segmentation across heterogeneous pathology images. To support this paradigm, we curate VISTA-PATH Data, a large-scale pathology segmentation corpus comprising over 1.6 million image-mask-text triplets spanning 9 organs and 93 tissue classes. Across extensive held-out and external benchmarks, VISTA-PATH consistently outperforms existing segmentation foundation models. Importantly, VISTA-PATH supports dynamic human-in-the-loop refinement by propagating sparse, patch-level bounding-box annotation feedback into whole-slide segmentation. Finally, we show that the high-fidelity, class-aware segmentation produced by VISTA-PATH is a preferred model for computational pathology. It improve tissue microenvironment analysis through proposed Tumor Interaction Score (TIS), which exhibits strong and significant associations with patient survival. Together, these results establish VISTA-PATH as a foundation model that elevates pathology image segmentation from a static prediction to an interactive and clinically grounded representation for digital pathology.

Specifically, in twenty questions estimation, there are two players: an oracle and a questioner. The questioner aims to estimate target variables by posing queries to the oracle that knows the variables and using noisy responses to form reliable estimates. Typically, there are adaptive and non-adaptive query procedures. In adaptive querying, one designs the current query using previous queries and their noisy responses while in non-adaptive querying, all queries are posed simultaneously. Generally speaking, adaptive query procedures yield better performance. However, adaptive querying leads to privacy concerns, which were first studied by Tsitsiklis, Xu and Xu (COLT 2018) and by Xu, Xu and Yang (AISTATS 2021) for the noiseless case, where the oracle always provides correct answers to queries. In this paper, we generalize the above results to the more practical noisy case, by proposing a two-stage private query procedure, analyzing its non-asymptotic and second-order asymptotic achievable performance and discussing the impact of privacy concerns. Furthermore, when specialized to the noiseless case, our private query procedure achieves better performance than above-mentioned query procedures (COLT 2018, AISTATS 2021).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u566a\u58f0\u4e8c\u5341\u95ee\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u79c1-\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6743\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9690\u79c1\u67e5\u8be2\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5176\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u548c\u4e8c\u9636\u6e10\u8fd1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u67e5\u8be2\u867d\u7136\u6027\u80fd\u66f4\u4f18\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5f15\u53d1\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u9732\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u5173\u6ce8\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u5176\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u66f4\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u542b\u566a\u58f0\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9690\u79c1\u67e5\u8be2\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u975e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u67e5\u8be2\u6536\u96c6\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u5229\u7528\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u4fe1\u606f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u67e5\u8be2\u3002\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u548c\u4e8c\u9636\u6e10\u8fd1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "1. \u5728\u566a\u58f0\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\uff1b2. \u6240\u63d0\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b3. \u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9690\u79c1\u7ea6\u675f\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b4. \u5728\u65e0\u566a\u58f0\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86COLT 2018\u548cAISTATS 2021\u7684\u6210\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9690\u79c1\u67e5\u8be2\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u4f30\u8ba1\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Leveraging the structure of Neural Additive Models (NAMs) with separate projection vectors for each risk, our approach predicts the Cumulative Incidence Function using the Fine-Gray formulation, achieving high predictive power with intrinsically transparent and auditable predictions. We validated the model on several benchmark datasets and applied our model to predict future foot complications in diabetic patients across 29 Ontario hospitals (2016-2023). Our method achieves competitive performance compared to other deep survival models while providing transparency through shape functions and feature importance plots.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive general reasoning capabilities, they still fall short of achieving human-level understanding of physical principles. Existing datasets for physical reasoning either rely on real-world videos, which incur high annotation costs, or on synthetic simulations, which suffer from limited realism and diversity. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that leverages glitches in gameplay videos, referring to visual anomalies that violate predefined physical laws, as a rich and scalable supervision source for physical world understanding. We introduce PhysGame, an meta information guided instruction-tuning dataset containing 140,057 glitch-centric question-answer pairs across five physical domains and sixteen fine-grained categories. To ensure data accuracy, we design a prompting strategy that utilizes gameplay metadata such as titles and descriptions to guide high-quality QA generation. Complementing PhysGame, we construct GameBench, an expert-annotated benchmark with 880 glitch-identified gameplay videos designed to evaluate physical reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments show that PhysGame significantly enhances both Game2Real transferability, improving the real world physical reasoning performance of Qwen2.5VL by 2.5% on PhysBench, and Game2General transferability, yielding a 1.9% gain on the MVBench benchmark. Moreover, PhysGame-tuned models achieve a 3.7% absolute improvement on GameBench, demonstrating enhanced robustness in detecting physical implausibilities. These results indicate that learning from gameplay anomalies offers a scalable and effective pathway toward advancing physical world understanding in multimodal intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5229\u7528\u6e38\u620f\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u5f02\u5e38\u4f5c\u4e3a\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u7406\u89e3\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff1aPhysGame\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548cGameBench\u57fa\u51c6", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8981\u4e48\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5bfb\u627e\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPhysGame\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b140,057\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6e38\u620f\u6545\u969c\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u8986\u76d65\u4e2a\u7269\u7406\u9886\u57df\u548c16\u4e2a\u7ec6\u5206\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6e38\u620f\u5143\u6570\u636e\u5f15\u5bfc\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cfQA\u751f\u6210\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u6784\u5efaGameBench\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u57fa\u51c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPhysGame\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86Qwen2.5VL\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff08PhysBench\u4e0a\u63d0\u53472.5%\uff09\uff0c\u5728MVBench\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u63d0\u53471.9%\uff0c\u5728GameBench\u4e0a\u63d0\u53473.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4ece\u6e38\u620f\u5f02\u5e38\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Although both aim to ensure reliable performance, prior work has revealed a tradeoff in distribution and adversarial robustness. Specifically, adversarial training might increase reliance on spurious features, which can harm distribution robustness, especially the performance on some underrepresented subgroups. We present a theoretical analysis of adversarial and distribution robustness that provides a tractable surrogate for per-step adversarial training by studying models trained on perturbed data. In addition to the tradeoff, our work further identified a nuanced phenomenon that $\\ell_\\infty$ perturbations on data with moderate bias can yield an increase in distribution robustness. Moreover, the gain in distribution robustness remains on highly skewed data when simplicity bias induces reliance on the core feature, characterized as greater feature separability. Our theoretical analysis extends the understanding of the tradeoff by highlighting the interplay of the tradeoff and the feature separability. Despite the tradeoff that persists in many cases, overlooking the role of feature separability may lead to misleading conclusions about robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We establish a connection between perfect privacy and window-based redaction schemes, showing that erasing data up to a strong stationary time preserves privacy under suitable conditions.

Since categorical features are usually with a limited number of qualitative possible values, the nested granular cluster effect is prevalent in the implicit discrete distance space of categorical data. That is, data objects frequently overlap in space or subspace to form small compact clusters, and similar small clusters often form larger clusters. However, the distance space cannot be well-defined like the Euclidean distance due to the qualitative categorical data values, which brings great challenges to the cluster analysis of categorical data. In view of this, we design a Multi-Granular Competitive Penalization Learning (MGCPL) algorithm to allow potential clusters to interactively tune themselves and converge in stages with different numbers of naturally compact clusters. To leverage MGCPL, we also propose a Cluster Aggregation strategy based on MGCPL Encoding (CAME) to first encode the data objects according to the learned multi-granular distributions, and then perform final clustering on the embeddings. It turns out that the proposed MGCPL-guided Categorical Data Clustering (MCDC) approach is competent in automatically exploring the nested distribution of multi-granular clusters and highly robust to categorical data sets from various domains. Benefiting from its linear time complexity, MCDC is scalable to large-scale data sets and promising in pre-partitioning data sets or compute nodes for boosting distributed computing.

However, the long input sequences result in high computational latency due to the quadratic complexity of full attention. Various sparse attention mechanisms have been proposed. Training-free sparse attention is constrained by limited sparsity and thus offers modest acceleration, whereas training-based methods can reach much higher sparsity but demand substantial data and computation for training. In this work, we propose SALAD, introducing a lightweight linear attention branch in parallel with the sparse attention. By incorporating an input-dependent gating mechanism to finely balance the two branches, our method attains 90% sparsity and 1.72x inference speedup, while maintaining generation quality comparable to the full attention baseline. Moreover, our finetuning process is highly efficient, requiring only 2,000 video samples and 1,600 training steps with a batch size of 8.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this, we propose \\textbf{BoostFGL}, a boosting-style framework for fairness-aware FGL.

To bridge this gap, we introduce TangramPuzzle, a geometry-grounded benchmark designed to evaluate compositional spatial reasoning through the lens of the classic Tangram game. We propose the Tangram Construction Expression (TCE), a symbolic geometric framework that grounds tangram assemblies in exact, machine-verifiable coordinate specifications, to mitigate the ambiguity of visual approximation. We design two complementary tasks: Outline Prediction, which demands inferring global shapes from local components, and End-to-End Code Generation, which requires solving inverse geometric assembly problems.

Here, we present an adaptive graph model that decouples inference latency from computational complexity. By integrating a Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graph with a pre-computed voting mechanism, our framework completely transfers the computational burden of neighbor selection and weighting to the training phase. Within this topological structure, higher graph layers enable rapid navigation, while lower layers encode precise, node-specific decision boundaries with adaptive neighbor counts. Benchmarking against eight state-of-the-art baselines across six diverse datasets, we demonstrate that this architecture significantly accelerates inference speeds, achieving real-time performance, without compromising classification accuracy.

We extend this paradigm to the semi-supervised setting, enabling the use of large-scale, uncurated datasets containing a mixture of known and unknown classes to improve the hierarchical open-set performance. To this end, we propose a teacher-student framework based on pseudo-labeling. Two key components are introduced: 1) subtree pseudo-labels, which provide reliable supervision in the presence of unknown data, and 2) age-gating, a mechanism that mitigates overconfidence in pseudo-labels. Experiments show that our framework outperforms self-supervised pretraining followed by supervised adaptation, and even matches the fully supervised counterpart when using only 20 labeled samples per class on the iNaturalist19 benchmark.

With the rise of large language models (LLMs), textual attributes in FGL graphs are gaining attention. Text-attributed graph federated learning (TAG-FGL) improves FGL by explicitly leveraging LLMs to process and integrate these textual features. However, current TAG-FGL methods face three main challenges: \\textbf{(1) Overhead.} LLMs for processing long texts incur high token and computation costs. To make TAG-FGL practical, we introduce graph condensation (GC) to reduce computation load, but this choice also brings new issues. \\textbf{(2) Suboptimal.} To reduce LLM overhead, we introduce GC into TAG-FGL by compressing multi-hop texts/neighborhoods into a condensed core with fixed LLM surrogates. However, this one-shot condensation is often not client-adaptive, leading to suboptimal performance. \\textbf{(3) Interpretability.} LLM-based condensation further introduces a black-box bottleneck: summaries lack faithful attribution and clear grounding to specific source spans, making local inspection and auditing difficult. To address the above issues, we propose \\textbf{DANCE}, a new TAG-FGL paradigm with GC. To improve \\textbf{suboptimal} performance, DANCE performs round-wise, model-in-the-loop condensation refresh using the latest global model.

Existing methods focus either on extracting features from localized patches, or pursue processing entire images holistically, which leads to the cross temporal feature matching deviation and exhibiting sensitivity to radiometric and geometric noise. Following the above issues, we propose a dual-module collaboration guided hierarchical adaptive aggregation framework, namely HA2F, which consists of dynamic hierarchical feature calibration module (DHFCM) and noise-adaptive feature refinement module (NAFRM). The former dynamically fuses adjacent-level features through perceptual feature selection, suppressing irrelevant discrepancies to address multi-temporal feature alignment deviations. The NAFRM utilizes the dual feature selection mechanism to highlight the change sensitive regions and generate spatial masks, suppressing the interference of irrelevant regions or shadows. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed HA2F, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on LEVIR-CD, WHU-CD, and SYSU-CD datasets, surpassing existing comparative methods in terms of both precision metrics and computational efficiency.

While recent unlearning methods attempt to mitigate this, we identify a critical flaw: structural fragility. We empirically demonstrate that standard erasure achieves only superficial suppression, trapping the model in sharp minima where hallucinations catastrophically resurge after lightweight relearning. To ensure geometric stability, we propose SARE, which casts unlearning as a targeted min-max optimization problem and uses a Targeted-SAM mechanism to explicitly flatten the loss landscape around hallucinated concepts. By suppressing hallucinations under simulated worst-case parameter perturbations, our framework ensures robust removal stable against weight shifts.

However, existing CoVR frameworks typically fuse multimodal inputs in a single stage, achieving only marginal gains over initial baseline. To address this, we propose a novel CoVR framework that leverages the representational power of Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our framework incorporates a novel cross-attention module X-Aligner, composed of cross-attention layers that progressively fuse visual and textual inputs and align their multimodal representation with that of the target video. To further enhance the representation of the multimodal query, we incorporate the caption of the visual query as an additional input. The framework is trained in two stages to preserve the pretrained VLM representation. In the first stage, only the newly introduced module is trained, while in the second stage, the textual query encoder is also fine-tuned. We implement our framework on top of BLIP-family architecture, namely BLIP and BLIP-2, and train it on the Webvid-CoVR data set. In addition to in-domain evaluation on Webvid-CoVR-Test, we perform zero-shot evaluations on the Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) data sets CIRCO and Fashion-IQ.

To isolate the effect of collisions, we introduce Engram-Nine, a collision-free hot-tier extension that maps the most frequent n-grams through a Minimal Perfect Hash Function (MPHF) while retaining the original multi-head hashed lookup as a cold tier. Under a strictly iso-parameter setup, the collision-free design does not consistently improve validation loss.\n  Through route-stratified evaluation (decomposing per-token loss into hot/cold contributions), we uncover a consistent \"hot-to-cold advantage flip\" during training: hot (high-frequency) positions initially have lower loss, but cold positions eventually surpass them. Crucially, collision-free configurations flip earlier than collision-prone baselines, suggesting that collisions act as implicit regularization. We also identify a gating mismatch: the gate learns to favor hot positions early in training, but this preference persists even after the flip, assigning higher weights to positions with higher loss.\n  Our findings suggest that improving lookup precision alone does not guarantee better training outcomes. The dominant limitation may lie in gating credit assignment rather than index accuracy, and collision-induced noise may provide beneficial regularization that should not be naively eliminated.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u9891\u952e\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\u88ab\u6d88\u9664\u7684 Engram \u5185\u5b58\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u5e76\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u8fd9\u6697\u793a\u4e86\u952e\u51b2\u7a81\u672c\u8eab\u5177\u6709\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u66f4\u672c\u8d28\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u9ad8\u9891\u952e\u51b2\u7a81\u662f\u5426\u662f Engram \u98ce\u683c\u6761\u4ef6\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u6027\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u5982\u679c\u51b2\u7a81\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u90a3\u4e48\u6d88\u9664\u51b2\u7a81\u5e94\u8be5\u4f1a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u8bad\u7ec3\u635f\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165 Engram-Nine\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u70ed\u5c42\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u5c0f\u5b8c\u7f8e\u54c8\u5e0c\u51fd\u6570\uff08MPHF\uff09\u6620\u5c04\u6700\u9891\u7e41\u7684 n-gram\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u59cb\u591a\u5934\u54c8\u5e0c\u67e5\u627e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51b7\u5c42\u3002\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u7b49\u53c2\u6570\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u6709\u51b2\u7a81\u548c\u65e0\u51b2\u7a81\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8def\u7531\u5206\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a token \u7684\u635f\u5931\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u70ed/\u51b7\u5c42\u7684\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u65e0\u51b2\u7a81\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e76\u672a\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u5584\u9a8c\u8bc1\u635f\u5931\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u2018\u70ed\u5230\u51b7\u4f18\u52bf\u7ffb\u8f6c\u2019\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\u70ed\u5c42\uff08\u9ad8\u9891\uff09\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6700\u521d\u635f\u5931\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u4f46\u51b7\u5c42\u4f4d\u7f6e\u6700\u7ec8\u4f1a\u8d85\u8d8a\u3002\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u65e0\u51b2\u7a81\u914d\u7f6e\u6bd4\u6709\u51b2\u7a81\u57fa\u7ebf\u66f4\u65e9\u53d1\u751f\u7ffb\u8f6c\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u51b2\u7a81\u8d77\u5230\u4e86\u9690\u5f0f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u4e86\u95e8\u63a7\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u95e8\u63a7\u65e9\u671f\u5b66\u4f1a\u504f\u8892\u70ed\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u597d\u5373\u4f7f\u7ffb\u8f6c\u540e\u4ecd\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u4e86\u635f\u5931\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5355\u7eaf\u63d0\u9ad8\u67e5\u627e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5e76\u4e0d\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ed3\u679c\u66f4\u597d\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u9650\u5236\u53ef\u80fd\u5728\u4e8e\u95e8\u63a7\u7684\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u7d22\u5f15\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff1b\u800c\u4e14\u51b2\u7a81\u5f15\u5165\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u53ef\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u76ca\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u4e0d\u5e94\u88ab\u8f7b\u6613\u6d88\u9664\u3002"}}

To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight medical image classification framework that integrates self-supervised contrastive learning with quantum-enhanced feature modeling. MobileNetV2 is employed as a compact backbone and pretrained using a SimCLR-style self-supervised paradigm on unlabeled images. A lightweight parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) is embedded as a quantum feature enhancement module, forming a hybrid classical-quantum architecture, which is subsequently fine-tuned on limited labeled data. Experimental results demonstrate that, with only approximately 2-3 million parameters and low computational cost, the proposed method consistently outperforms classical baselines without self-supervised learning or quantum enhancement in terms of Accuracy, AUC, and F1-score. Feature visualization further indicates improved discriminability and representation stability.

Comments are welcome", "summary": "Nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques, particularly UMAP, are widely used for visualizing high-dimensional data. However, UMAP's local Euclidean distance assumption often fails to capture intrinsic manifold geometry, leading to topological tearing and structural collapse. We identify UMAP's sensitivity to the k-nearest neighbor graph as a key cause. To address this, we introduce Ollivier-Ricci curvature as a geometric prior, reinforcing edges at geometric bottlenecks and reducing redundant links. Since curvature estimation is noise-sensitive, we also incorporate a topological prior using Jaccard similarity to ensure neighborhood consistency. The resulting method, JORC-UMAP, better distinguishes true manifold structure from spurious connections. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that JORC-UMAP reduces tearing and collapse more effectively than standard UMAP and other DR methods, as measured by SVM accuracy and triplet preservation scores, while maintaining computational efficiency. This work offers a geometry-aware enhancement to UMAP for more faithful data visualization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, there are major challenges to accurately capturing small targets in object detection due to the imbalanced scale and the blurred edges. To address these issues, boundary and position information mining (BPIM) framework is proposed for capturing object edge and location cues. The proposed BPIM includes position information guidance (PIG) module for obtaining location information, boundary information guidance (BIG) module for extracting object edge, cross scale fusion (CSF) module for gradually assembling the shallow layer image feature, three feature fusion (TFF) module for progressively combining position and boundary information, and adaptive weight fusion (AWF) module for flexibly merging the deep layer semantic feature. Therefore, BPIM can integrate boundary, position, and scale information in image for small object detection using attention mechanisms and cross-scale feature fusion strategies. Furthermore, BPIM not only improves the discrimination of the contextual feature by adaptive weight fusion with boundary, but also enhances small object perceptions by cross-scale position fusion. On the VisDrone2021, DOTA1.0, and WiderPerson datasets, experimental results show the better performances of BPIM compared to the baseline Yolov5-P2, and obtains the promising performance in the state-of-the-art methods with comparable computation load.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, predicting early-stage startup success remains challenging due to data scarcity (e.g., many VC firms have information about only a few dozen of early-stage startups and whether they were successful). This limits the effectiveness of traditional machine learning methods that rely on large labeled datasets for model training. To address this challenge, we propose an in-context learning framework for startup success prediction using large language models (LLMs) that requires no model training and leverages only a small set of labeled startups as demonstration examples. Specifically, we propose a novel k-nearest-neighbor-based in-context learning framework, called kNN-ICL, which selects the most relevant past startups as examples based on similarity. Using real-world profiles from Crunchbase, we find that the kNN-ICL approach achieves higher prediction accuracy than supervised machine learning baselines and vanilla in-context learning. Further, we study how performance varies with the number of in-context examples and find that a high balanced accuracy can be achieved with as few as 50 examples. Together, we demonstrate that in-context learning can serve as a decision-making tool for VC firms operating in data-scarce environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9\u65e9\u671f\u521d\u521b\u4f01\u4e1a\u6295\u8d44\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684kNN-ICL\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6837\u672c\u5373\u53ef\u83b7\u5f97\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e9\u671f\u521d\u521b\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u6210\u529f\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u98ce\u9669\u6295\u8d44\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u6311\u6218\u2014\u2014\u8bb8\u591aVC\u516c\u53f8\u53ea\u6709\u51e0\u5341\u4e2a\u521d\u521b\u4f01\u4e1a\u7684\u6807\u6ce8\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u8fd9\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u6548\u679c\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86kNN-ICL\uff08k\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u521d\u521b\u4f01\u4e1a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u793a\u4f8b\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u5c11\u6570\u6807\u6ce8\u6837\u672c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6f14\u793a\u793a\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528Crunchbase\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0ckNN-ICL\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u76d1\u7763\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u666e\u901a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002\u4ec5\u970050\u4e2a\u793a\u4f8b\u5c31\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u98ce\u9669\u6295\u8d44\u516c\u53f8\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u6709\u6548\u51b3\u7b56\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5bf9\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e9\u671f\u521d\u521b\u4f01\u4e1a\u6210\u529f\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While weather impacts railway reliability, particularly in Nordic regions, existing datasets rarely integrate meteorological information with operational train data. This study presents the first publicly available dataset combining Finnish railway operations with synchronized meteorological observations from 2018-2024. The dataset integrates operational metrics from Finland Digitraffic Railway Traffic Service with weather measurements from 209 environmental monitoring stations, using spatial-temporal alignment via Haversine distance. It encompasses 28 engineered features across operational variables and meteorological measurements, covering approximately 38.5 million observations from Finland's 5,915-kilometer rail network. Preprocessing includes strategic missing data handling through spatial fallback algorithms, cyclical encoding of temporal features, and robust scaling of weather data to address sensor outliers. Analysis reveals distinct seasonal patterns, with winter months exhibiting delay rates exceeding 25\\% and geographic clustering of high-delay corridors in central and northern Finland.

However, mainstream architectures face critical scalability bottlenecks due to the explicit construction of geometric features or dense tensor products on \\textit{every} edge. To overcome this, we introduce \\textbf{E2Former-V2}, a scalable architecture that integrates algebraic sparsity with hardware-aware execution. We first propose \\textbf{E}quivariant \\textbf{A}xis-\\textbf{A}ligned \\textbf{S}parsification (EAAS). EAAS builds on Wigner-$6j$ convolution by exploiting an $\\mathrm{SO}(3) \\rightarrow \\mathrm{SO}(2)$ change of basis to transform computationally expensive dense tensor contractions into efficient, sparse parity re-indexing operations. Building on this representation, we introduce \\textbf{On-the-Fly Equivariant Attention}, a fully node-centric mechanism implemented via a custom fused Triton kernel. By eliminating materialized edge tensors and maximizing SRAM utilization, our kernel achieves a \\textbf{20$\\times$ improvement in TFLOPS} compared to standard implementations. Extensive experiments on the SPICE and OMol25 datasets demonstrate that E2Former-V2 maintains comparable predictive performance while notably accelerating inference.

However, existing garment reconstruction methods typically rely on unstructured representations, such as 3D Gaussian Splats, struggling to provide accurate reconstructions of garment topology and sewing structures. As a result, the reconstructed outputs are often unsuitable for high-fidelity physical simulation. We propose ReWeaver, a novel framework for topology-accurate 3D garment and sewing pattern reconstruction from sparse multi-view RGB images. Given as few as four input views, ReWeaver predicts seams and panels as well as their connectivities in both the 2D UV space and the 3D space. The predicted seams and panels align precisely with the multi-view images, yielding structured 2D--3D garment representations suitable for 3D perception, high-fidelity physical simulation, and robotic manipulation. To enable effective training, we construct a large-scale dataset GCD-TS, comprising multi-view RGB images, 3D garment geometries, textured human body meshes and annotated sewing patterns. The dataset contains over 100,000 synthetic samples covering a wide range of complex geometries and topologies.

While prevailing approaches enhance forecasting performance by modifying architectures or introducing novel enhancement strategies, they often fail to dynamically disentangle and leverage the complex, intertwined temporal patterns inherent in time series, thus resulting in the learning of static, averaged representations that lack context-aware capabilities. To address this, we propose the Dual-Prototype Adaptive Disentanglement framework (DPAD), a model-agnostic auxiliary method that equips forecasting models with the ability of pattern disentanglement and context-aware adaptation. Specifically, we construct a Dynamic Dual-Prototype bank (DDP), comprising a common pattern bank with strong temporal priors to capture prevailing trend or seasonal patterns, and a rare pattern bank dynamically memorizing critical yet infrequent events, and then an Dual-Path Context-aware routing (DPC) mechanism is proposed to enhance outputs with selectively retrieved context-specific pattern representations from the DDP. Additionally, we introduce a Disentanglement-Guided Loss (DGLoss) to ensure that each prototype bank specializes in its designated role while maintaining comprehensive coverage. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DPAD consistently improves forecasting performance and reliability of state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We show that data quality is a significant limiting factor in many published datasets and propose CER-HV (CER-based Ranking with Human Verification) as a framework to detect and clean label errors. CER-HV combines a CER-based noise detector, built on a carefully configured Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN) with early stopping to avoid overfitting noisy samples, and a human-in-the-loop (HITL) step that verifies high-ranking samples. The framework reveals that several existing datasets contain previously underreported problems, including transcription, segmentation, orientation, and non-text content errors. These have been identified with up to 90 percent precision in the Muharaf and 80-86 percent in the PHTI datasets.\n  We also show that our CRNN achieves state-of-the-art performance across five of the six evaluated datasets, reaching 8.45 percent Character Error Rate (CER) on KHATT (Arabic), 8.26 percent on PHTI (Pashto), 10.66 percent on Ajami, and 10.11 percent on Muharaf (Arabic), all without any data cleaning. We establish a new baseline of 11.3 percent CER on the PHTD (Persian) dataset. Applying CER-HV improves the evaluation CER by 0.3-0.6 percent on the cleaner datasets and 1.0-1.8 percent on the noisier ones. Although our experiments focus on documents written in an Arabic-script language, including Arabic, Persian, Urdu, Ajami, and Pashto, the framework is general and can be applied to other text recognition datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This makes CSAS a valuable tool for target recognition in mine warfare where the diversity of point of view is essential for reducing false alarms. CSAS processing typically produces a very high-resolution two-dimensional image. However, the parallax introduced by the circular displacement of the illuminator fill-in the shadow regions, and the shadow cast by an object on the seafloor is lost in favor of azimuth coverage and resolution. Yet the shadows provide complementary information on target shape useful for target recognition. In this paper, we explore a way to retrieve shadow information from CSAS data to improve target analysis and carry 3D reconstruction. Sub-aperture filtering is used to get a collection of images at various points of view along the circular trajectory and fixed focus shadow enhancement (FFSE) is applied to obtain sharp shadows. An interactive interface is also proposed to allow human operators to visualize these shadows along the circular trajectory. A space-carving reconstruction method is applied to infer the 3D shape of the object from the segmented shadows.

As an explicit representation optimized through gradient propagation among primitives, optimization widely accepted in deep neural networks (DNNs) is actually adopted in 3DGS, such as synchronous weight updating and Adam with the adaptive gradient. However, considering the physical significance and specific design in 3DGS, there are two overlooked details in the optimization of 3DGS: (i) update step coupling, which induces optimizer state rescaling and costly attribute updates outside the viewpoints, and (ii) gradient coupling in the moment, which may lead to under- or over-effective regularization. Nevertheless, such a complex coupling is under-explored. After revisiting the optimization of 3DGS, we take a step to decouple it and recompose the process into: Sparse Adam, Re-State Regularization and Decoupled Attribute Regularization. Taking a large number of experiments under the 3DGS and 3DGS-MCMC frameworks, our work provides a deeper understanding of these components. Finally, based on the empirical analysis, we re-design the optimization and propose AdamW-GS by re-coupling the beneficial components, under which better optimization efficiency and representation effectiveness are achieved simultaneously.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u56de\u987e\u4e863DGS\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u8026\u5408\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u89e3\u8026\u4e0e\u91cd\u7ec4\u4f18\u5316\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u6700\u7ec8\u63d0\u51faAdamW-GS\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5f53\u524d3DGS\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u2014\u2014\u66f4\u65b0\u6b65\u957f\u8026\u5408\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u7f29\u653e\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u8026\u5408\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd", "method": "\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c63DGS\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u7a00\u758fAdam\u3001\u91cd\u65b0\u72b6\u6001\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u89e3\u8026\u5c5e\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\u5e76\u63d0\u51faAdamW-GS", "result": "\u57283DGS\u548c3DGS-MCMC\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u65b0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684AdamW-GS\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8868\u793a\u6709\u6548\u6027", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u67903DGS\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u8026\u5408\u673a\u5236\u5e76\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0cAdamW-GS\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3a3DGS\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u89e3"}}

While machine learning approaches like Random Forest and XGBoost are standard for this task, they treat spatial predictions of GEDI observations from multispectral or SAR remote sensing data as independent without adapting to the varying difficulty of heterogeneous landscapes. We demonstrate these approaches generally fail to produce calibrated prediction intervals. We identify that this stems from conflating ensemble variance with aleatoric uncertainty and ignoring local spatial context.\n  To resolve this, we introduce Attentive Neural Processes (ANPs), a probabilistic meta-learning framework that explicitly conditions predictions on local observation sets and geospatial foundation model embeddings. Unlike static ensembles, ANPs learn a flexible spatial covariance function, allowing uncertainty estimates to expand in complex landscapes and contract in homogeneous areas. We validate this approach across five distinct biomes ranging from Tropical Amazonian forests to Boreal and Alpine ecosystems, demonstrating that ANPs achieve competitive accuracy while maintaining near-ideal uncertainty calibration. We demonstrate the operational utility of the method through few-shot adaptation, where the model recovers most of the performance gap in cross-region transfer using minimal local data.

Focusing on combinatorial optimization, we refine outputs from the FunSearch algorithm [Romera-Paredes et al., Nature 2023] to derive state-of-the-art lower bounds for standard heuristics. Specifically, we target the generation of adversarial instances where these heuristics perform poorly. By iterating on FunSearch's outputs, we identify improved constructions for hierarchical $k$-median clustering, bin packing, the knapsack problem, and a generalization of Lov\u00e1sz's gasoline problem - some of these have not seen much improvement for over a decade, despite intermittent attention. These results illustrate how expert oversight can effectively extrapolate algorithmic insights from LLM-based evolutionary methods to break long-standing barriers.\n  Our findings demonstrate that while LLMs provide critical initial patterns, human expertise is essential for transforming these patterns into mathematically rigorous and insightful constructions.

In this setting, a learner may adaptively query the oracle with any sequence of vectors and observe the corresponding real-valued output. We begin with the simplest case, a single-head softmax-attention regressor. We show that for a model with width $d$, there is an elementary algorithm to learn the parameters of single-head attention exactly with $O(d^2)$ queries. Further, we show that if there exists an algorithm to learn ReLU feedforward networks (FFNs), then the single-head algorithm can be easily adapted to learn one-layer Transformers with single-head attention. Next, motivated by the regime where the head dimension $r \\ll d$, we provide a randomised algorithm that learns single-head attention-based models with $O(rd)$ queries via compressed sensing arguments. We also study robustness to noisy oracle access, proving that under mild norm and margin conditions, the parameters can be estimated to $\\varepsilon$ accuracy with a polynomial number of queries even when outputs are only provided up to additive tolerance.

In this paper, we propose BrepARG, the first attempt to encode B-rep's geometry and topology into a holistic token sequence representation, enabling sequence-based B-rep generation with an autoregressive architecture. Specifically, BrepARG encodes B-rep into 3 types of tokens: geometry and position tokens representing geometric features, and face index tokens representing topology. Then the holistic token sequence is constructed hierarchically, starting with constructing the geometry blocks (i.e., faces and edges) using the above tokens, followed by geometry block sequencing. Finally, we assemble the holistic sequence representation for the entire B-rep. We also construct a transformer-based autoregressive model that learns the distribution over holistic token sequences via next-token prediction, using a multi-layer decoder-only architecture with causal masking. Experiments demonstrate that BrepARG achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Recent prompt-based methods, which integrate pretrained backbones with task-specific prompts, have made notable progress. However, under extreme few-shot incremental settings, the model's ability to transfer and generalize becomes critical, and it is thus essential to leverage pretrained knowledge to learn feature representations that can be shared across future categories during the base session. Inspired by the mechanism of the CLS token, which is similar to human attention and progressively filters out task-irrelevant information, we propose the CLS Token Attention Steering Prompts (CASP). This approach introduces class-shared trainable bias parameters into the query, key, and value projections of the CLS token to explicitly modulate the self-attention weights. To further enhance generalization, we also design an attention perturbation strategy and perform Manifold Token Mixup in the shallow feature space, synthesizing potential new class features to improve generalization and reserve the representation capacity for upcoming tasks.

While the approximation power of neural networks is now relatively well understood, training very deep architectures remains challenging due to highly non-convex and often ill-conditioned optimization landscapes. In contrast, for relatively shallow networks, most notably one-hidden-layer $\\texttt{ReLU}$ models, training admits convex reformulations with global guarantees, motivating learning paradigms that improve stability while scaling to depth. MGDL builds upon this insight by training deep networks grade by grade: previously learned grades are frozen, and each new residual block is trained solely to reduce the remaining approximation error, yielding an interpretable and stable hierarchical refinement process. We develop an operator-theoretic foundation for MGDL and prove that, for any continuous target function, there exists a fixed-width multigrade $\\texttt{ReLU}$ scheme whose residuals decrease strictly across grades and converge uniformly to zero. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first rigorous theoretical guarantee that grade-wise training yields provable vanishing approximation error in deep networks.

However, predicting aesthetic experiences remains difficult due to the subjective nature of perception and the complexity of visual responses. This study introduces a dual-branch CNN-LSTM framework that fuses visual features with eye-tracking signals to predict aesthetic evaluations of residential interiors. We collected a dataset of 224 interior design videos paired with synchronized gaze data from 28 participants who rated 15 aesthetic dimensions. The proposed model attains 72.2% accuracy on objective dimensions (e.g., light) and 66.8% on subjective dimensions (e.g., relaxation), outperforming state-of-the-art video baselines and showing clear gains on subjective evaluation tasks. Notably, models trained with eye-tracking retain comparable performance when deployed with visual input alone. Ablation experiments further reveal that pupil responses contribute most to objective assessments, while the combination of gaze and visual cues enhances subjective evaluations. These findings highlight the value of incorporating eye-tracking as privileged information during training, enabling more practical tools for aesthetic assessment in interior design.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u5206\u652fCNN-LSTM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u773c\u52a8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u4f4f\u5b85\u5185\u90e8\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u7f8e\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u798f\u7949\u7684\u73af\u5883\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u5ba4\u5185\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u8bc4\u4ef7\uff0c\u4f46\u7f8e\u5b66\u4f53\u9a8c\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4ecd\u5f88\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u611f\u77e5\u5177\u6709\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u4e14\u89c6\u89c9\u53cd\u5e94\u590d\u6742\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u6536\u96c6\u4e86224\u4e2a\u5ba4\u5185\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89c6\u9891\u53ca28\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u5bf915\u4e2a\u7f8e\u5b66\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8bc4\u5206\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53cc\u5206\u652fCNN-LSTM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u773c\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5ba2\u89c2\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u5982\u5149\u7ebf\uff09\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523072.2%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e3b\u89c2\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff08\u5982\u653e\u677e\u5ea6\uff09\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523066.8%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u4f30\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u773c\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u4e5f\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u77b3\u5b54\u53cd\u5e94\u5bf9\u5ba2\u89c2\u8bc4\u4f30\u8d21\u732e\u6700\u5927\uff0c\u800c\u6ce8\u89c6\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u7ed3\u5408\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u4e3b\u89c2\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u878d\u5165\u773c\u52a8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7279\u6743\u4fe1\u606f\u5177\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u80fd\u4e3a\u5ba4\u5185\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7f8e\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Building on the switching gradient method, FedSGM provides projection-free, primal-only updates, avoiding expensive dual-variable tuning or inner solvers. To handle communication limits, FedSGM incorporates bi-directional error feedback, correcting the bias introduced by compression while explicitly understanding the interaction between compression noise and multi-step local updates. We derive convergence guarantees showing that the averaged iterate achieves the canonical $\\boldsymbol{\\mathcal{O}}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ rate, with additional high-probability bounds that decouple optimization progress from sampling noise due to partial participation. Additionally, we introduce a soft switching version of FedSGM to stabilize updates near the feasibility boundary. To our knowledge, FedSGM is the first framework to unify functional constraints, compression, multiple local updates, and partial client participation, establishing a theoretically grounded foundation for constrained federated learning.

Across ImageNet-1k CNNs and Transformers, this proxy is strongly negative with Top-1 and positive with loss. Selecting the checkpoint with the minimum head gradient in a short tail window closes most of the gap to the oracle (4.24% +/- 2.00% with a universal setup, about 1.12% with light per-family tuning). For practical deployment, a head-scale normalization is more stable within classic CNN families (e.g., ResNets), while a feature-scale normalization works well for Transformers and modern CNNs. The same one-batch probe also predicts COCO detection/segmentation mAP. In diffusion (UNet/DDPM on CIFAR-10), it tracks progress and enables near-oracle tail-window selection; it is positively correlated with same-distribution probe MSE and negatively with FID (lower is better), so it can be used as a lightweight, label-free monitor.

We identify that traditional unlearning methods exploit MoE's architectural vulnerability: they manipulate routers to redirect queries away from knowledgeable experts rather than erasing knowledge, causing a loss of model utility and superficial forgetting. We propose Geometric Routing Invariance Preservation (GRIP), an algorithm-agnostic framework for unlearning for MoE. Our core contribution is a geometric constraint, implemented by projecting router gradient updates into an expert-specific null-space. Crucially, this decouples routing stability from parameter rigidity: while discrete expert selections remain stable for retained knowledge, the continuous router parameters remain plastic within the null space, allowing the model to undergo necessary internal reconfiguration to satisfy unlearning objectives. This forces the unlearning optimization to erase knowledge directly from expert parameters rather than exploiting the superficial router manipulation shortcut.

Extensive experiments on large-scale MoE models demonstrate that our adapter eliminates expert selection shift (achieving over 95% routing stability) across all tested unlearning methods while preserving their utility.

However, the unimodal nature of most current AI systems limits their ability to achieve a holistic understanding of surgical workflows. This highlights the need for general-purpose surgical AI systems capable of comprehensively modeling the interrelated components of surgical scenes. Recent advances in large vision-language models that integrate multimodal data processing offer strong potential for modeling surgical tasks and providing human-like scene reasoning and understanding. Despite their promise, systematic investigations of VLMs in surgical applications remain limited. In this study, we evaluate the effectiveness of large VLMs for the fundamental surgical vision task of detecting surgical tools. Specifically, we investigate three state-of-the-art VLMs, Qwen2.5, LLaVA1.5, and InternVL3.5, on the GraSP robotic surgery dataset under both zero-shot and parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning settings. Our results demonstrate that Qwen2.5 consistently achieves superior detection performance in both configurations among the evaluated VLMs. Furthermore, compared with the open-set detection baseline Grounding DINO, Qwen2.5 exhibits stronger zero-shot generalization and comparable fine-tuned performance. Notably, Qwen2.5 shows superior instrument recognition, while Grounding DINO demonstrates stronger localization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

ColorConceptBench moves beyond explicit color names or codes by probing how models translate 1,281 implicit color concepts using a foundation of 6,369 human annotations. Our evaluation of seven leading T2I models reveals that current models lack sensitivity to abstract semantics, and crucially, this limitation appears resistant to standard interventions (e.g., scaling and guidance).

Yet, designing reward functions is notoriously time-consuming and prone to misspecification. To address this issue, our first goal is to understand how to support RL practitioners in specifying appropriate weights for a reward function. We leverage the Trajectory Alignment Coefficient (TAC), a metric that evaluates how closely a reward function's induced preferences match those of a domain expert. To evaluate whether TAC provides effective support in practice, we conducted a human-subject study in which RL practitioners tuned reward weights for Lunar Lander. We found that providing TAC during reward tuning led participants to produce more performant reward functions and report lower cognitive workload relative to standard tuning without TAC. However, the study also underscored that manual reward design, even with TAC, remains labor-intensive. This limitation motivated our second goal: to learn a reward model that maximizes TAC directly. Specifically, we propose Soft-TAC, a differentiable approximation of TAC that can be used as a loss function to train reward models from human preference data. Validated in the racing simulator Gran Turismo 7, reward models trained using Soft-TAC successfully captured preference-specific objectives, resulting in policies with qualitatively more distinct behaviors than models trained with standard Cross-Entropy loss. This work demonstrates that TAC can serve as both a practical tool for guiding reward tuning and a reward learning objective in complex domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While attention sink frames have been introduced to mitigate this performance decay, they often induce a critical failure mode we term sink-collapse: the generated content repeatedly reverts to the sink frame, resulting in abrupt scene resets and cyclic motion patterns. Our analysis reveals that sink-collapse originates from an inherent conflict between the periodic structure of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and the multi-head attention mechanisms prevalent in current generative models. To address it, we propose a lightweight, training-free approach that effectively suppresses this behavior by introducing multi-head RoPE jitter that breaks inter-head attention homogenization and mitigates long-horizon collapse. Extensive experiments show that our method successfully alleviates sink-collapse while preserving generation quality.

Recent advancements in Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) models have shown great promise in camera pose estimation and 3D reconstruction. However, these models typically rely on ground truth labels for training, posing challenges when adapting to unlabeled and unseen scenes. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised framework to train VGGT with unlabeled data, thereby enhancing its localization capability in large-scale environments. To achieve this, we extend conventional pair-wise relations to sequence-wise geometric constraints for self-supervised learning. Specifically, in each sequence, we sample multiple source frames and geometrically project them onto different target frames, which improves temporal feature consistency. We formulate physical photometric consistency and geometric constraints as a joint optimization loss to circumvent the requirement for hard labels. By training the model with this proposed method, not only the local and global cross-view attention layers but also the camera and depth heads can effectively capture the underlying multi-view geometry. Experiments demonstrate that the model converges within hundreds of iterations and achieves significant improvements in large-scale localization.

In this paper, we explore an alternative approach that uses reward signals to guide the generation process, enabling more efficient and scalable autoregressive generation. By using reward signals to guide the model, our method simplifies training while preserving high visual fidelity and temporal consistency.

Our key insight is to reframe the masked diffusion process as a block-wise causal model. This perspective allows us to design a strictly causal, permutation-equivariant architecture that computes all conditional probabilities across multiple denoising steps in a single, parallel forward pass. The resulting architecture supports efficient, autoregressive-style decoding and a progressive permutation training scheme, allowing the model to learn both canonical left-to-right and random token orderings. Leveraging this flexibility, we introduce a novel strided parallel generation strategy that accelerates inference by generating tokens in parallel streams while maintaining global coherence.

Results show that balancing the training data with LDM-generated samples substantially improves IDS performance, achieving F1-scores of up to 0.99 for DDoS and Mirai attacks and consistently outperforming competing methods. Additionally, quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that LDMs effectively preserve feature dependencies while generating diverse samples and reduce sampling time by approximately 25\\% compared to diffusion models operating directly in data space. These findings highlight latent diffusion as an effective and scalable solution for synthetic IoT attack data generation, substantially mitigating the impact of class imbalance in ML-based IDSs for IoT scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4f7f\u7528LDM\u6a21\u578b\u589e\u5f3a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684IDS\u53d7\u5230\u6b63\u5e38\u4e0e\u653b\u51fb\u6d41\u91cf\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6837\u672c\u903c\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528LDM\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u653b\u51fb\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u5178\u578b\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6307\u6807\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e0b\u6e38IDS\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u751f\u6210\u672c\u8d28\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "LDM\u5e73\u8861\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86IDS\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3aDDoS/Mirai\u653b\u51fb\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u9ad80.99\u7684F1\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u6bd4\u7ade\u4e89\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002LDM\u6709\u6548\u4fdd\u6301\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u95f4\u4e5f\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea625%\u3002", "conclusion": "LDM\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u5165\u4fb5\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6709\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7279\u5f81\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Our evaluations show that all frontier models struggle in interactive settings, achieving low success rates in both the easy (46.6%) and hard (26.0%) configurations. Our experiments reveal notable limitations: models struggle to effectively leverage long context, performing worse with an unbounded history than with truncated windows. Furthermore, we find that several text-based symbolic tasks become substantially harder once rendered visually. However, explicit goal observations, textual feedback, and exploratory demonstrations in partially observable or unknown-dynamics settings for supervised finetuning yield consistent gains, highlighting concrete failure modes and pathways for improving multi-step visual decision-making.

While single-view relighting has advanced significantly, existing generative approaches struggle to maintain the rigorous lighting consistency essential for multi-camera broadcasts, stereoscopic cinema, and virtual production. SyncLight addresses this by enabling precise control over light intensity and color across a multi-view capture of a scene, conditioned on a single reference edit. Our method leverages a multi-view diffusion transformer trained using a latent bridge matching formulation, achieving high-fidelity relighting of the entire image set in a single inference step. To facilitate training, we introduce a large-scale hybrid dataset comprising diverse synthetic environments -- curated from existing sources and newly designed scenes -- alongside high-fidelity, real-world multi-view captures under calibrated illumination.

In this work, we introduce \\textbf{AnyView}, a diffusion-based video generation framework for \\emph{dynamic view synthesis} with minimal inductive biases or geometric assumptions. We leverage multiple data sources with various levels of supervision, including monocular (2D), multi-view static (3D) and multi-view dynamic (4D) datasets, to train a generalist spatiotemporal implicit representation capable of producing zero-shot novel videos from arbitrary camera locations and trajectories. We evaluate AnyView on standard benchmarks, showing competitive results with the current state of the art, and propose \\textbf{AnyViewBench}, a challenging new benchmark tailored towards \\emph{extreme} dynamic view synthesis in diverse real-world scenarios. In this more dramatic setting, we find that most baselines drastically degrade in performance, as they require significant overlap between viewpoints, while AnyView maintains the ability to produce realistic, plausible, and spatiotemporally consistent videos when prompted from \\emph{any} viewpoint.
