TL;DR: SuperHead是一个增强低分辨率、可动画3D头部模型的框架，通过3D生成模型的先验知识提升几何和纹理质量，同时保持3D一致性、时间一致性和身份特征


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D对话头像生成常受低质量视频源限制，导致重建效果不佳；现有超分辨率技术难以处理动态3D输入

Method: 通过动态感知3D反演方案利用预训练3D生成模型的先验知识，优化潜在表示生成超分辨率3D高斯溅射模型，然后绑定到参数化头部模型；使用不同表情和视角的上采样2D面部渲染和深度图进行联合监督

Result: SuperHead生成的面部细节丰富的可动画头像，在动态运动下保持真实性，视觉质量显著优于基线方法

Conclusion: SuperHead框架能有效提升低分辨率3D面部模型的质量和动画能力，为沉浸式应用提供高质量虚拟化身

Abstract: Creating high-fidelity, animatable 3D talking heads is crucial for immersive applications, yet often hindered by the prevalence of low-quality image or video sources, which yield poor 3D reconstructions. In this paper, we introduce SuperHead, a novel framework for enhancing low-resolution, animatable 3D head avatars. The core challenge lies in synthesizing high-quality geometry and textures, while ensuring both 3D and temporal consistency during animation and preserving subject identity. Despite recent progress in image, video and 3D-based super-resolution (SR), existing SR techniques are ill-equipped to handle dynamic 3D inputs. To address this, SuperHead leverages the rich priors from pre-trained 3D generative models via a novel dynamics-aware 3D inversion scheme. This process optimizes the latent representation of the generative model to produce a super-resolved 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) head model, which is subsequently rigged to an underlying parametric head model (e.g., FLAME) for animation. The inversion is jointly supervised using a sparse collection of upscaled 2D face renderings and corresponding depth maps, captured from diverse facial expressions and camera viewpoints, to ensure realism under dynamic facial motions. Experiments demonstrate that SuperHead generates avatars with fine-grained facial details under dynamic motions, significantly outperforming baseline methods in visual quality.

Abstract: Understanding egocentric videos plays a vital role for embodied intelligence. Recent multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) can accept both visual and audio inputs. However, due to the challenge of obtaining text labels with coherent joint-modality information, whether MLLMs can jointly understand both modalities in egocentric videos remains under-explored. To address this problem, we introduce EgoAVU, a scalable data engine to automatically generate egocentric audio-visual narrations, questions, and answers. EgoAVU enriches human narrations with multimodal context and generates audio-visual narrations through cross-modal correlation modeling. Token-based video filtering and modular, graph-based curation ensure both data diversity and quality. Leveraging EgoAVU, we construct EgoAVU-Instruct, a large-scale training dataset of 3M samples, and EgoAVU-Bench, a manually verified evaluation split covering diverse tasks. EgoAVU-Bench clearly reveals the limitations of existing MLLMs: they bias heavily toward visual signals, often neglecting audio cues or failing to correspond audio with the visual source. Finetuning MLLMs on EgoAVU-Instruct effectively addresses this issue, enabling up to 113% performance improvement on EgoAVU-Bench. Such benefits also transfer to other benchmarks such as EgoTempo and EgoIllusion, achieving up to 28% relative performance gain. Code will be released to the community.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Single-view 3D reconstruction in complex real-world scenes is challenging due to noise, object diversity, and limited dataset availability. To address these challenges, we propose MGP-KAD, a novel multimodal feature fusion framework that integrates RGB and geometric prior to enhance reconstruction accuracy. The geometric prior is generated by sampling and clustering ground-truth object data, producing class-level features that dynamically adjust during training to improve geometric understanding. Additionally, we introduce a hybrid decoder based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to overcome the limitations of traditional linear decoders in processing complex multimodal inputs. Extensive experiments on the Pix3D dataset demonstrate that MGP-KAD achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, significantly improving geometric integrity, smoothness, and detail preservation. Our work provides a robust and effective solution for advancing single-view 3D reconstruction in complex scenes.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Driven by the emergence of Controllable Video Diffusion, existing Sim2Real methods for autonomous driving video generation typically rely on explicit intermediate representations to bridge the domain gap. However, these modalities face a fundamental Consistency-Realism Dilemma. Low-level signals (e.g., edges, blurred images) ensure precise control but compromise realism by "baking in" synthetic artifacts, whereas high-level priors (e.g., depth, semantics, HDMaps) facilitate photorealism but lack the structural detail required for consistent guidance. In this work, we present Driving with DINO (DwD), a novel framework that leverages Vision Foundation Module (VFM) features as a unified bridge between the simulation and real-world domains. We first identify that these features encode a spectrum of information, from high-level semantics to fine-grained structure. To effectively utilize this, we employ Principal Subspace Projection to discard the high-frequency elements responsible for "texture baking," while concurrently introducing Random Channel Tail Drop to mitigate the structural loss inherent in rigid dimensionality reduction, thereby reconciling realism with control consistency. Furthermore, to fully leverage DINOv3's high-resolution capabilities for enhancing control precision, we introduce a learnable Spatial Alignment Module that adapts these high-resolution features to the diffusion backbone. Finally, we propose a Causal Temporal Aggregator employing causal convolutions to explicitly preserve historical motion context when integrating frame-wise DINO features, which effectively mitigates motion blur and guarantees temporal stability.

### [5] [MetaSSP: Enhancing Semi-supervised Implicit 3D Reconstruction through Meta-adaptive EMA and SDF-aware Pseudo-label Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06163)
*Luoxi Zhang,Chun Xie,Itaru Kitahara*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MetaSSP是一个新颖的半监督单视图3D重建框架，通过梯度参数重要性估计和SDF感知伪标签加权机制，有效利用大量无标签图像提升重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于隐式SDF的单视图3D重建方法需要大量标注数据，限制了可扩展性。为了解决这个问题，需要开发能够充分利用无标签图像的半监督方法。

Method: 提出MetaSSP框架，包含：1）基于梯度的参数重要性估计来正则化自适应EMA更新；2）结合增强一致性和SDF方差的SDF感知伪标签加权机制；3）从10%监督预热开始，通过统一流程联合优化有标签和无标签数据。

Result: 在Pix3D基准测试中，与现有半监督基线相比，Chamfer距离降低了约20.61%，IoU提高了约24.09%，达到了新的最优水平。

Conclusion: MetaSSP通过创新的半监督策略有效地解决了单视图3D重建中的数据稀缺问题，显著提升了重建精度，为少标注数据的3D重建提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit SDF-based methods for single-view 3D reconstruction achieve high-quality surfaces but require large labeled datasets, limiting their scalability. We propose MetaSSP, a novel semi-supervised framework that exploits abundant unlabeled images. Our approach introduces gradient-based parameter importance estimation to regularize adaptive EMA updates and an SDF-aware pseudo-label weighting mechanism combining augmentation consistency with SDF variance. Beginning with a 10% supervised warm-up, the unified pipeline jointly refines labeled and unlabeled data. On the Pix3D benchmark, our method reduces Chamfer Distance by approximately 20.61% and increases IoU by around 24.09% compared to existing semi-supervised baselines, setting a new state of the art.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M3框架通过多模态、多智能体、多轮次的无训练方法，系统性地提升文本到图像生成模型在复杂组合提示下的表现，使开源模型性能超越商业旗舰系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型在文本到图像合成中虽然保真度高，但在处理涉及多重约束的复杂组合提示时表现不佳，需要新的方法来系统解决这些失败案例。

Method: M3采用训练免费的推理时优化框架，构建多智能体循环：规划器将提示分解为可验证的检查表，然后专门的检查器、精炼器和编辑器智能体逐个修正约束条件，验证器确保单调改进。该方法兼容任何预训练的文本到图像模型。

Result: 在OneIG-EN基准测试中，Qwen-Image+M3超过Imagen4(0.515)和Seedream 3.0(0.530)，达到SOTA性能(0.532)。GenEval组合指标显著提升，在强化测试集上的空间推理性能几乎翻倍。

Conclusion: 智能多智能体推理能够提升开源模型超越专有替代方案，M3作为即插即用模块，为组合生成建立了无需昂贵重新训练的新范式。

Abstract: Generative models have achieved impressive fidelity in text-to-image synthesis, yet struggle with complex compositional prompts involving multiple constraints. We introduce \textbf{M3 (Multi-Modal, Multi-Agent, Multi-Round)}, a training-free framework that systematically resolves these failures through iterative inference-time refinement. M3 orchestrates off-the-shelf foundation models in a robust multi-agent loop: a Planner decomposes prompts into verifiable checklists, while specialized Checker, Refiner, and Editor agents surgically correct constraints one at a time, with a Verifier ensuring monotonic improvement. Applied to open-source models, M3 achieves remarkable results on the challenging OneIG-EN benchmark, with our Qwen-Image+M3 surpassing commercial flagship systems including Imagen4 (0.515) and Seedream 3.0 (0.530), reaching state-of-the-art performance (0.532 overall). This demonstrates that intelligent multi-agent reasoning can elevate open-source models beyond proprietary alternatives. M3 also substantially improves GenEval compositional metrics, effectively doubling spatial reasoning performance on hardened test sets. As a plug-and-play module compatible with any pre-trained T2I model, M3 establishes a new paradigm for compositional generation without costly retraining.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于残差变分自编码器的无监督异常检测框架，用于盆腔MRI的实时异常检测，无需疾病标签即可识别病理区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 女性盆腔疾病诊断常因解剖学变异和MRI解读复杂性而延迟，现有AI方法多为疾病专用且缺乏实时兼容性，难以临床推广。

Method: 使用仅包含健康矢状位T2加权扫描的数据训练残差变分自编码器，通过重建误差热图检测异常，并采用扩散生成合成数据增强鲁棒性。

Result: 在公开子宫肌瘤MRI数据集上获得平均AUC 0.736（敏感度0.828，特异度0.692），重建速度约92.6帧/秒，临床评估扩展到子宫内膜癌等疾病。

Conclusion: 该框架建立了女性盆腔无监督异常检测的基准，支持未来实时MRI集成，代码已开源供学术合作使用。

Abstract: Pelvic diseases in women of reproductive age represent a major global health burden, with diagnosis frequently delayed due to high anatomical variability, complicating MRI interpretation. Existing AI approaches are largely disease-specific and lack real-time compatibility, limiting generalizability and clinical integration. To address these challenges, we establish a benchmark framework for disease- and parameter-agnostic, real-time-compatible unsupervised anomaly detection in pelvic MRI. The method uses a residual variational autoencoder trained exclusively on healthy sagittal T2-weighted scans acquired across diverse imaging protocols to model normal pelvic anatomy. During inference, reconstruction error heatmaps indicate deviations from learned healthy structure, enabling detection of pathological regions without labeled abnormal data. The model is trained on 294 healthy scans and augmented with diffusion-generated synthetic data to improve robustness. Quantitative evaluation on the publicly available Uterine Myoma MRI Dataset yields an average area-under-the-curve (AUC) value of 0.736, with 0.828 sensitivity and 0.692 specificity. Additional inter-observer clinical evaluation extends analysis to endometrial cancer, endometriosis, and adenomyosis, revealing the influence of anatomical heterogeneity and inter-observer variability on performance interpretation. With a reconstruction time of approximately 92.6 frames per second, the proposed framework establishes a baseline for unsupervised anomaly detection in the female pelvis and supports future integration into real-time MRI. Code is available upon request (https://github.com/AniKnu/UADPelvis), prospective data sets are available for academic collaboration.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PhenoLIP框架，通过构建大规模表型知识图谱和教师指导的知识蒸馏，将结构化医学表型知识融入视觉语言模型，显著提升表型识别和跨模态检索性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学视觉语言模型主要依赖粗糙的图像-文本对比目标，未能充分捕捉医学表型本体中编码的系统化视觉知识，导致结构化医疗图像理解能力不足

Method: 1) 构建PhenoKG知识图谱(52万高质量图像-文本对，3000+表型)；2) 提出PhenoLIP两阶段预训练框架：先在文本本体数据上学习知识增强的表型嵌入空间，再通过教师引导的知识蒸馏将结构化知识融入多模态预训练；3) 建立PhenoBench专家验证基准数据集

Result: PhenoLIP在表型分类准确率上比BiomedCLIP提升8.85%，在跨模态检索上比BIOMEDICA提升15.03%，显著优于现有最佳方法

Conclusion: 将表型中心化先验知识整合到医学视觉语言模型中，能够实现更结构化、可解释的医疗图像理解，为医学AI提供有价值的模型框架和基准资源

Abstract: Recent progress in large-scale CLIP-like vision-language models(VLMs) has greatly advanced medical image analysis. However, most existing medical VLMs still rely on coarse image-text contrastive objectives and fail to capture the systematic visual knowledge encoded in well-defined medical phenotype ontologies. To address this gap, we construct PhenoKG, the first large-scale, phenotype-centric multimodal knowledge graph that encompasses over 520K high-quality image-text pairs linked to more than 3,000 phenotypes. Building upon PhenoKG, we propose PhenoLIP, a novel pretraining framework that explicitly incorporates structured phenotype knowledge into medical VLMs through a two-stage process. We first learn a knowledge-enhanced phenotype embedding space from textual ontology data and then distill this structured knowledge into multimodal pretraining via a teacher-guided knowledge distillation objective. To support evaluation, we further introduce PhenoBench, an expert-verified benchmark designed for phenotype recognition, comprising over 7,800 image--caption pairs covering more than 1,000 phenotypes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhenoLIP outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines, improving upon BiomedCLIP in phenotype classification accuracy by 8.85\% and BIOMEDICA in cross-modal retrieval by 15.03%, underscoring the value of integrating phenotype-centric priors into medical VLMs for structured and interpretable medical image understanding.

Motivation: 传统DPO方法依赖大规模高质量人类偏好标注，存在成本高和可扩展性瓶颈。为了解决这个问题，作者提出利用廉价的合成AI反馈来扩展有限的真实数据。

Method: 提出DeDPO方法，将因果推断中的消偏估计技术融入DPO目标中，通过识别和修正合成标注中的系统性偏差与噪声，实现从不完美的合成反馈中稳健学习。

Result: 实验表明DeDPO对不同的合成标注方法都具有鲁棒性，性能能够达到甚至偶尔超过完全使用人类标注数据的理论上限。

Conclusion: DeDPO为利用廉价合成反馈实现人机对齐提供了一种可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a predominant alignment method for diffusion models, facilitating off-policy training without explicit reward modeling. However, its reliance on large-scale, high-quality human preference labels presents a severe cost and scalability bottleneck. To overcome this, We propose a semi-supervised framework augmenting limited human data with a large corpus of unlabeled pairs annotated via cost-effective synthetic AI feedback. Our paper introduces Debiased DPO (DeDPO), which uniquely integrates a debiased estimation technique from causal inference into the DPO objective. By explicitly identifying and correcting the systematic bias and noise inherent in synthetic annotators, DeDPO ensures robust learning from imperfect feedback sources, including self-training and Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Experiments demonstrate that DeDPO is robust to the variations in synthetic labeling methods, achieving performance that matches and occasionally exceeds the theoretical upper bound of models trained on fully human-labeled data. This establishes DeDPO as a scalable solution for human-AI alignment using inexpensive synthetic supervision.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Accurate 3D pose estimation of drones is essential for security and surveillance systems. However, existing methods often rely on prior drone information such as physical sizes or 3D meshes. At the same time, current datasets are small-scale, limited to single models, and collected under constrained environments, which makes reliable validation of generalization difficult. We present DroneKey++, a prior-free framework that jointly performs keypoint detection, drone classification, and 3D pose estimation. The framework employs a keypoint encoder for simultaneous keypoint detection and classification, and a pose decoder that estimates 3D pose using ray-based geometric reasoning and class embeddings. To address dataset limitations, we construct 6DroneSyn, a large-scale synthetic benchmark with over 50K images covering 7 drone models and 88 outdoor backgrounds, generated using 360-degree panoramic synthesis. Experiments show that DroneKey++ achieves MAE 17.34 deg and MedAE 17.1 deg for rotation, MAE 0.135 m and MedAE 0.242 m for translation, with inference speeds of 19.25 FPS (CPU) and 414.07 FPS (GPU), demonstrating both strong generalization across drone models and suitability for real-time applications. The dataset is publicly available.

*Jorge Daniel Rodríguez-Vidal,Gabriel Villalonga,Diego Porres,Antonio M. López Peña*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出一种新颖的可微分车辆模型框架，将预测的动作序列（油门、转向、刹车）映射到对应的自车坐标系轨迹点，从而在轨迹点空间中进行监督，解决了动作模型与轨迹点模型之间的训练和评估鸿沟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前端到端自动驾驶系统主要分为轨迹点模型和动作模型两类。大多数基准测试协议和训练流程都是基于轨迹点的，这使得动作模型的训练和比较变得困难，阻碍了其发展。为了弥合这一鸿沟，需要一个能够连接两种范式的框架。

Method: 提出一个可微分车辆模型，该模型能够将预测的动作序列（油门、转向、刹车）展开为对应的自车坐标系下的轨迹点轨迹，并在轨迹点空间中提供监督信号。这使得动作模型能够在基于轨迹点的基准测试中直接训练和评估，无需修改评估协议。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的基准测试上进行了评估，结果显示该方法相比基线模型有持续改善。特别是在NAVSIM navhard基准测试中，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法首次使动作模型能够在基于轨迹点的基准测试中被有效训练和评估，无需修改现有协议，为动作模型的发展提供了重要支持。代码将在论文被接受后公开。

Abstract: End-to-End Autonomous Driving (E2E-AD) systems are typically grouped by the nature of their outputs: (i) waypoint-based models that predict a future trajectory, and (ii) action-based models that directly output throttle, steer and brake. Most recent benchmark protocols and training pipelines are waypoint-based, which makes action-based policies harder to train and compare, slowing their progress. To bridge this waypoint-action gap, we propose a novel, differentiable vehicle-model framework that rolls out predicted action sequences to their corresponding ego-frame waypoint trajectories while supervising in waypoint space. Our approach enables action-based architectures to be trained and evaluated, for the first time, within waypoint-based benchmarks without modifying the underlying evaluation protocol. We extensively evaluate our framework across multiple challenging benchmarks and observe consistent improvements over the baselines. In particular, on NAVSIM \texttt{navhard} our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 研究提出使用Iso-Energy假设来理解视觉语言模型共享嵌入空间的几何结构，通过对齐稀疏自编码器实现能量一致性，揭示了双模态原子携带跨模态对齐信号，单模态原子解释模态差距的重要发现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视觉语言模型在图文对齐方面取得了显著成功，但其共享嵌入空间的几何结构仍然缺乏深入理解。研究者希望通过探索这一几何结构来更好地理解模型的工作原理

Method: 提出Iso-Energy假设(跨模态冗余概念)，并开发对齐稀疏自编码器(SAE)在训练中强制能量一致性同时保持重构能力，通过该工具进行几何分析

Result: 1.稀疏双模态原子携带全部跨模态对齐信号；2.单模态原子作为模态特定偏置，完全解释了模态差距；3.移除单模态原子可消除差距而不影响性能；4.限制向量运算到双模态子空间可产生分布内编辑和改进检索

Conclusion: 正确的归纳偏置既能保持模型保真度，又能使潜在几何结构变得可解释和可操作，为视觉语言模型的几何理解提供了新框架

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) align images and text with remarkable success, yet the geometry of their shared embedding space remains poorly understood. To probe this geometry, we begin from the Iso-Energy Assumption, which exploits cross-modal redundancy: a concept that is truly shared should exhibit the same average energy across modalities. We operationalize this assumption with an Aligned Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) that encourages energy consistency during training while preserving reconstruction. We find that this inductive bias changes the SAE solution without harming reconstruction, giving us a representation that serves as a tool for geometric analysis. Sanity checks on controlled data with known ground truth confirm that alignment improves when Iso-Energy holds and remains neutral when it does not. Applied to foundational VLMs, our framework reveals a clear structure with practical consequences: (i) sparse bimodal atoms carry the entire cross-modal alignment signal; (ii) unimodal atoms act as modality-specific biases and fully explain the modality gap; (iii) removing unimodal atoms collapses the gap without harming performance; (iv) restricting vector arithmetic to the bimodal subspace yields in-distribution edits and improved retrieval. These findings suggest that the right inductive bias can both preserve model fidelity and render the latent geometry interpretable and actionable.

Abstract: The ubiquity of monocular videos capturing daily hand-object interactions presents a valuable resource for embodied intelligence. While 3D hand reconstruction from in-the-wild videos has seen significant progress, reconstructing the involved objects remains challenging due to severe occlusions and the complex, coupled motion of the camera, hands, and object. In this paper, we introduce ForeHOI, a novel feed-forward model that directly reconstructs 3D object geometry from monocular hand-object interaction videos within one minute of inference time, eliminating the need for any pre-processing steps. Our key insight is that, the joint prediction of 2D mask inpainting and 3D shape completion in a feed-forward framework can effectively address the problem of severe occlusion in monocular hand-held object videos, thereby achieving results that outperform the performance of optimization-based methods. The information exchanges between the 2D and 3D shape completion boosts the overall reconstruction quality, enabling the framework to effectively handle severe hand-object occlusion. Furthermore, to support the training of our model, we contribute the first large-scale, high-fidelity synthetic dataset of hand-object interactions with comprehensive annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ForeHOI achieves state-of-the-art performance in object reconstruction, significantly outperforming previous methods with around a 100x speedup.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种基于视觉变换器的深度学习模型，利用指纹图像来区分Kabuki综合征和Wiedemann-Steiner综合征患者以及健康对照组，展示了指纹特征在罕见遗传综合征诊断中的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Kabuki综合征和Wiedemann-Steiner综合征是两种临床表现相似的罕见发育障碍，但由于遗传检测和专家资源的限制，许多患者无法获得准确诊断。尽管皮纹异常是多种遗传综合征的典型特征，但在分子检测时代仍未得到充分利用。本研究旨在探索指纹图像作为无创、可解释的诊断工具的可行性。

Method: 利用基于视觉变换器的深度学习模型，通过指纹图像进行三组二元分类任务：正常对照组与Kabuki综合征的比较、正常对照组与Wiedemann-Steiner综合征的比较，以及两种综合征之间的比较。同时采用注意力机制可视化方法来识别模型预测中最关键的指纹区域。

Result: 模型在三个分类任务中取得了令人满意的性能：正常对照vs.Kabuki综合征的AUC为0.80（F1分数0.71），正常对照vs.Wiedemann-Steiner综合征的AUC为0.73（F1分数0.72），Kabuki综合征vs.Wiedemann-Steiner综合征的AUC为0.85（F1分数0.83）。注意力可视化揭示了与模型预测最相关的指纹区域。

Conclusion: 研究表明指纹中存在综合征特异性特征，证明了基于指纹的人工智能工具作为无创、可解释且易于获取的未来诊断辅助手段的可行性，有助于早期诊断这些被低估的遗传综合征。

Abstract: Kabuki syndrome (KS) and Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WSS) are rare but distinct developmental disorders that share overlapping clinical features, including neurodevelopmental delay, growth restriction, and persistent fetal fingertip pads. While genetic testing remains the diagnostic gold standard, many individuals with KS or WSS remain undiagnosed due to barriers in access to both genetic testing and expertise. Dermatoglyphic anomalies, despite being established hallmarks of several genetic syndromes, remain an underutilized diagnostic signal in the era of molecular testing. This study presents a vision transformer-based deep learning model that leverages fingerprint images to distinguish individuals with KS and WSS from unaffected controls and from one another. We evaluate model performance across three binary classification tasks. Across the three classification tasks, the model achieved AUC scores of 0.80 (control vs. KS), 0.73 (control vs. WSS), and 0.85 (KS vs. WSS), with corresponding F1 scores of 0.71, 0.72, and 0.83, respectively. Beyond classification, we apply attention-based visualizations to identify fingerprint regions most salient to model predictions, enhancing interpretability. Together, these findings suggest the presence of syndrome-specific fingerprint features, demonstrating the feasibility of a fingerprint-based artificial intelligence (AI) tool as a noninvasive, interpretable, and accessible future diagnostic aid for the early diagnosis of underdiagnosed genetic syndromes.

Abstract: Recent research in geospatial machine learning has demonstrated that models pretrained with self-supervised learning on Earth observation data can perform well on downstream tasks with limited training data. However, most of the existing geospatial benchmark datasets have few data modalities and poor global representation, limiting the ability to evaluate multimodal pretrained models at global scales. To fill this gap, we introduce MMEarth-Bench, a collection of five new multimodal environmental tasks with 12 modalities, globally distributed data, and both in- and out-of-distribution test splits. We benchmark a diverse set of pretrained models and find that while (multimodal) pretraining tends to improve model robustness in limited data settings, geographic generalization abilities remain poor. In order to facilitate model adaptation to new downstream tasks and geographic domains, we propose a model-agnostic method for test-time training with multimodal reconstruction (TTT-MMR) that uses all the modalities available at test time as auxiliary tasks, regardless of whether a pretrained model accepts them as input. Our method improves model performance on both the random and geographic test splits, and geographic batching leads to a good trade-off between regularization and specialization during TTT. Our dataset, code, and visualization tool are linked from the project page at lgordon99.github.io/mmearth-bench.

TL;DR: 针对多模态手术导航中的图像配准难题，本文提出一种基于多级相关金字塔优化的无监督多模态医学图像配准方法MCPO，在Learn2Reg 2025竞赛中取得优异表现。


<details>

Motivation: 多模态图像差异和术中组织位移导致的图像形变，使术前与术中多模态图像的有效配准面临严峻挑战，影响手术导航的精度和可靠性。

Method: 1. 基于模态独立邻域描述符提取各模态特征并映射到特征空间；2. 设计多级金字塔融合优化机制，通过密集相关性分析和权重平衡耦合凸优化，实现位移场的全局优化与局部细节互补。

Conclusion: MCPO方法在多模态术前-术中图像配准中表现出色，解决了传统方法的局限性，具有较强的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Surgical navigation based on multimodal image registration has played a significant role in providing intraoperative guidance to surgeons by showing the relative position of the target area to critical anatomical structures during surgery. However, due to the differences between multimodal images and intraoperative image deformation caused by tissue displacement and removal during the surgery, effective registration of preoperative and intraoperative multimodal images faces significant challenges. To address the multimodal image registration challenges in Learn2Reg 2025, an unsupervised multimodal medical image registration method based on multilevel correlation pyramidal optimization (MCPO) is designed to solve these problems. First, the features of each modality are extracted based on the modality independent neighborhood descriptor, and the multimodal images is mapped to the feature space. Second, a multilevel pyramidal fusion optimization mechanism is designed to achieve global optimization and local detail complementation of the displacement field through dense correlation analysis and weight-balanced coupled convex optimization for input features at different scales. Our method focuses on the ReMIND2Reg task in Learn2Reg 2025. Based on the results, our method achieved the first place in the validation phase and test phase of ReMIND2Reg. The MCPO is also validated on the Resect dataset, achieving an average TRE of 1.798 mm. This demonstrates the broad applicability of our method in preoperative-to-intraoperative image registration. The code is avaliable at https://github.com/wjiazheng/MCPO.

TL;DR: 提出新方法将Vision Transformer线性层转换为卷积层，使其能在CNN优化的BPU硬件上高效部署，保持性能的同时获得显著加速


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于CNN优化的BPU硬件架构与Vision Transformer计算特性不匹配（线性层处理三维数据而BPU针对四维卷积优化），导致难以在BPU上有效部署Vision Transformer模型

Method: 将Vision Transformer中的线性层和层归一化操作替换为精心设计的卷积算子，使模型能够完全利用BPU的加速能力，同时无需重新训练即可继承原始权重参数

Result: 量化DeiT-Base在ImageNet上达到80.4%准确率（原模型81.8%），实现最高3.8倍的推理加速；在花卉分类数据集上微调后，DeiT-Base仅出现0.5%准确率下降

Conclusion: 该方法首次成功在BPU上完整部署Vision Transformer，有效解决了硬件架构不匹配问题，实现了性能与速度的良好平衡

Abstract: With the advancement of deep learning technologies, specialized neural processing hardware such as Brain Processing Units (BPUs) have emerged as dedicated platforms for CNN acceleration, offering optimized INT8 computation capabilities for convolutional operations. Meanwhile, Vision Transformer (ViT) models, such as the Data-efficient Image Transformer (DeiT), have demonstrated superior performance and play increasingly crucial roles in computer vision tasks. However, due to the architectural mismatch between CNN-optimized hardware and Vision Transformer computation characteristics--namely, that linear layers in Transformers operate on three-dimensional data while BPU acceleration is designed for four-dimensional convolution operations-it is difficult or even impossible to leverage BPU's advantages when deploying Vision Transformers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that restructures the Vision Transformer by replacing linear layers and layer normalization operations with carefully designed convolutional operators. This enables DeiT to fully utilize the acceleration capabilities of BPUs, while allowing the original weight parameters to be inherited by the restructured models without retraining or fine-tuning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful deployment of Vision Transformers that fully leverages BPU classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, the quantized DeiT-Base model achieves 80.4% accuracy on ImageNet, compared to the original 81.8%, while obtaining up to a 3.8* inference speedup. Our finetuned DeiT model on the flower classification dataset also achieves excellent performance, with only a 0.5% accuracy drop for the DeiT-Base model, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 现有CTTA方法主要优化适应过程，但模型能否在长期持续变化的环境中保持良好表现仍是一个关键问题。本文探讨如何通过重新初始化(重置)策略来改善模型的长时期适应能力，发现长期性能与标签翻转模式存在关联。

Method: 提出自适应平衡重新初始化(ABR)策略，根据标签翻转的变化自适应确定权重重新初始化间隔。该方法基于标签翻转轨迹模式与长期性能的观测关联，设计简单但有效的重置策略。

Result: 在广泛的CTTA基准测试中验证了ABR方法的有效性，取得了优越的性能表现。实验结果证实了该策略在长期持续环境变化中的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于标签翻转变化的自适应权重重新初始化策略(ABR)能够有效提升模型在长期持续测试时域适应任务中的性能，为CTTA提供了简单可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Continual test-time domain adaptation (CTTA) aims to adjust models so that they can perform well over time across non-stationary environments. While previous methods have made considerable efforts to optimize the adaptation process, a crucial question remains: Can the model adapt to continually changing environments over a long time? In this work, we explore facilitating better CTTA in the long run using a re-initialization (or reset) based method. First, we observe that the long-term performance is associated with the trajectory pattern in label flip. Based on this observed correlation, we propose a simple yet effective policy, Adaptive-and-Balanced Re-initialization (ABR), towards preserving the model's long-term performance. In particular, ABR performs weight re-initialization using adaptive intervals. The adaptive interval is determined based on the change in label flip. The proposed method is validated on extensive CTTA benchmarks, achieving superior performance.

TL;DR: ConceptBank提出了一种无参数的校准框架，用于缓解SAM3在开放词汇分割中因数据漂移和概念漂移导致的视觉证据与提示词对齐失效问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM3虽然通过可提示概念分割革新了开放词汇分割，但其依赖预定义概念的特性使得模型在目标域发生数据漂移或概念漂移时，视觉证据与提示词的对齐会失效

Method: 通过构建数据集特定的概念库来动态校准：1）通过类别视觉原型锚定目标域证据；2）挖掘代表性支持样本来抑制数据漂移中的离群值；3）融合候选概念以纠正概念漂移

Result: ConceptBank有效适应了包括自然场景和遥感场景在内的分布漂移，为OVS的鲁棒性和效率设立了新基线

Conclusion: ConceptBank是一个无参数的校准框架，能够动态恢复SAM3中视觉证据与概念提示的对齐，显著提升了模型在分布漂移情况下的适应能力

Abstract: The recent introduction of \texttt{SAM3} has revolutionized Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) through \textit{promptable concept segmentation}, which grounds pixel predictions in flexible concept prompts. However, this reliance on pre-defined concepts makes the model vulnerable: when visual distributions shift (\textit{data drift}) or conditional label distributions evolve (\textit{concept drift}) in the target domain, the alignment between visual evidence and prompts breaks down. In this work, we present \textsc{ConceptBank}, a parameter-free calibration framework to restore this alignment on the fly. Instead of adhering to static prompts, we construct a dataset-specific concept bank from the target statistics. Our approach (\textit{i}) anchors target-domain evidence via class-wise visual prototypes, (\textit{ii}) mines representative supports to suppress outliers under data drift, and (\textit{iii}) fuses candidate concepts to rectify concept drift. We demonstrate that \textsc{ConceptBank} effectively adapts \texttt{SAM3} to distribution drifts, including challenging natural-scene and remote-sensing scenarios, establishing a new baseline for robustness and efficiency in OVS.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPDA-SAM是一种基于SAM的自提示深度感知实例分割模型，通过提取语义和空间提示，以及粗到精的RGB-D特征融合，提升了传统SAM对空间结构感知和边界分割的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SAM性能严重依赖手动提示的质量，且RGB图像缺乏深度信息，导致模型对空间结构的感知和对象边界的分割能力受限。需要一种自提示且深度感知的改进方法。

Method: 设计了语义-空间自提示模块（SSSPM），从SAM的图像编码器和掩码解码器中分别提取语义和空间提示；提出了粗到精RGB-D融合模块（C2FFM），融合单目RGB图像提取的特征和其估计的深度图；深度图的结构信息提供粗粒度引导，局部深度变化编码细粒度特征表示。

Result: 实验结果表明，SPDA-SAM在12个不同的数据集上优于当前最先进的同类方法。

Conclusion: 自提示的引导和粗到精RGB-D融合操作对空间信息损失的补偿，是SPDA-SAM取得优异性能的关键原因。

Abstract: Recently, Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated strong generalizability in various instance segmentation tasks. However, its performance is severely dependent on the quality of manual prompts. In addition, the RGB images that instance segmentation methods normally use inherently lack depth information. As a result, the ability of these methods to perceive spatial structures and delineate object boundaries is hindered. To address these challenges, we propose a Self-prompted Depth-Aware SAM (SPDA-SAM) for instance segmentation. Specifically, we design a Semantic-Spatial Self-prompt Module (SSSPM) which extracts the semantic and spatial prompts from the image encoder and the mask decoder of SAM, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce a Coarse-to-Fine RGB-D Fusion Module (C2FFM), in which the features extracted from a monocular RGB image and the depth map estimated from it are fused. In particular, the structural information in the depth map is used to provide coarse-grained guidance to feature fusion, while local variations in depth are encoded in order to fuse fine-grained feature representations. To our knowledge, SAM has not been explored in such self-prompted and depth-aware manners. Experimental results demonstrate that our SPDA-SAM outperforms its state-of-the-art counterparts across twelve different data sets. These promising results should be due to the guidance of the self-prompts and the compensation for the spatial information loss by the coarse-to-fine RGB-D fusion operation.

TL;DR: FlowConsist训练框架通过使用边际速度替换条件速度、引入轨迹矫正策略，解决了快速流模型中的轨迹漂移和误差累积问题，在ImageNet 256×256上仅用1步采样就达到了1.52的FID。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前快速流模型存在两个根本问题：1）随机配对噪声-数据样本构建的条件速度会导致系统性的轨迹漂移；2）模型近似误差随着时间步长累积，导致长时区间出现严重偏差。

Method: 提出FlowConsist框架：1）使用模型自身预测的边际速度替代条件速度，使优化与真实轨迹对齐；2）引入轨迹矫正策略，在轨迹的每个时间步对齐生成样本和真实样本的边际分布。

Result: 在ImageNet 256×256上实现了1.52的FID新SOTA，仅需1步采样。

Conclusion: FlowConsist通过强制轨迹一致性，有效解决了快速流模型中的轨迹漂移和误差累积问题，显著提升了一步生成的性能。

Abstract: Fast flow models accelerate the iterative sampling process by learning to directly predict ODE path integrals, enabling one-step or few-step generation. However, we argue that current fast-flow training paradigms suffer from two fundamental issues. First, conditional velocities constructed from randomly paired noise-data samples introduce systematic trajectory drift, preventing models from following a consistent ODE path. Second, the model's approximation errors accumulate over time steps, leading to severe deviations across long time intervals. To address these issues, we propose FlowConsist, a training framework designed to enforce trajectory consistency in fast flows. We propose a principled alternative that replaces conditional velocities with the marginal velocities predicted by the model itself, aligning optimization with the true trajectory. To further address error accumulation over time steps, we introduce a trajectory rectification strategy that aligns the marginal distributions of generated and real samples at every time step along the trajectory. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art on ImageNet 256$\times$256, achieving an FID of 1.52 with only 1 sampling step.

Motivation: 传统显著目标检测方法通常被视为客观预测任务，只关注视觉线索而忽略了不同观察者的主观因素，导致问题定义不合理且不能适应人类感知的模糊性和多样性。

Method: 提出Observer-Centric Salient Object Detection概念，利用多模态大语言模型构建高效数据标注流水线，创建OC-SODBench数据集，并设计OC-SODAgent智能体，采用类似人类的“感知-反思-调整”过程实现观察者中心的显著目标检测。

Conclusion: 通过引入以观察者为中心的视角，在人类感知和计算建模之间架起桥梁，提供更真实、灵活的显著对象理解，推动了显著目标检测向更个性化、情境感知的方向发展。

Abstract: Salient object detection is inherently a subjective problem, as observers with different priors may perceive different objects as salient. However, existing methods predominantly formulate it as an objective prediction task with a single groundtruth segmentation map for each image, which renders the problem under-determined and fundamentally ill-posed. To address this issue, we propose Observer-Centric Salient Object Detection (OC-SOD), where salient regions are predicted by considering not only the visual cues but also the observer-specific factors such as their preferences or intents. As a result, this formulation captures the intrinsic ambiguity and diversity of human perception, enabling personalized and context-aware saliency prediction. By leveraging multi-modal large language models, we develop an efficient data annotation pipeline and construct the first OC-SOD dataset named OC-SODBench, comprising 33k training, validation and test images with 152k textual prompts and object pairs. Built upon this new dataset, we further design OC-SODAgent, an agentic baseline which performs OC-SOD via a human-like "Perceive-Reflect-Adjust" process. Extensive experiments on our proposed OC-SODBench have justified the effectiveness of our contribution. Through this observer-centric perspective, we aim to bridge the gap between human perception and computational modeling, offering a more realistic and flexible understanding of what makes an object truly "salient."

Abstract: Efficient neural networks are essential for scaling machine learning models to real-time applications and resource-constrained environments. Fully-connected feedforward layers (FFLs) introduce computation and parameter count bottlenecks within neural network architectures. To address this challenge, in this work, we propose a new class of dense layers that generalize standard fully-connected feedforward layers, \textbf{E}fficient, \textbf{U}nified and \textbf{Gen}eral dense layers (EUGens). EUGens leverage random features to approximate standard FFLs and go beyond them by incorporating a direct dependence on the input norms in their computations. The proposed layers unify existing efficient FFL extensions and improve efficiency by reducing inference complexity from quadratic to linear time. They also lead to \textbf{the first} unbiased algorithms approximating FFLs with arbitrary polynomial activation functions. Furthermore, EuGens reduce the parameter count and computational overhead while preserving the expressive power and adaptability of FFLs. We also present a layer-wise knowledge transfer technique that bypasses backpropagation, enabling efficient adaptation of EUGens to pre-trained models. Empirically, we observe that integrating EUGens into Transformers and MLPs yields substantial improvements in inference speed (up to \textbf{27}\%) and memory efficiency (up to \textbf{30}\%) across a range of tasks, including image classification, language model pre-training, and 3D scene reconstruction. Overall, our results highlight the potential of EUGens for the scalable deployment of large-scale neural networks in real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of vision-language models has catalyzed the emergence of GUI agents, which hold immense potential for automating complex tasks, from online shopping to flight booking, thereby alleviating the burden of repetitive digital workflows. As a foundational capability, GUI grounding is typically established as a prerequisite for end-to-end task execution. It enables models to precisely locate interface elements, such as text and icons, to perform accurate operations like clicking and typing. Unlike prior works that fine-tune models already possessing strong spatial awareness (e.g., Qwen3-VL), we aim to master the full technical pipeline by starting from a base model with minimal grounding ability, such as POINTS-1.5. We introduce POINTS-GUI-G-8B, which achieves state-of-the-art performance with scores of 59.9 on ScreenSpot-Pro, 66.0 on OSWorld-G, 95.7 on ScreenSpot-v2, and 49.9 on UI-Vision. Our model's success is driven by three key factors: (1) Refined Data Engineering, involving the unification of diverse open-source datasets format alongside sophisticated strategies for augmentation, filtering, and difficulty grading; (2) Improved Training Strategies, including continuous fine-tuning of the vision encoder to enhance perceptual accuracy and maintaining resolution consistency between training and inference; and (3) Reinforcement Learning (RL) with Verifiable Rewards. While RL is traditionally used to bolster reasoning, we demonstrate that it significantly improves precision in the perception-intensive GUI grounding task. Furthermore, GUI grounding provides a natural advantage for RL, as rewards are easily verifiable and highly accurate.

Abstract: 3D semantic occupancy prediction enables autonomous vehicles (AVs) to perceive fine-grained geometric and semantic structure of their surroundings from onboard sensors, which is essential for safe decision-making and navigation. Recent models for 3D semantic occupancy prediction have successfully addressed the challenge of describing real-world objects with varied shapes and classes. However, the intermediate representations used by existing methods for 3D semantic occupancy prediction rely heavily on 3D voxel volumes or a set of 3D Gaussians, hindering the model's ability to efficiently and effectively capture fine-grained geometric details in the 3D driving environment. This paper introduces TFusionOcc, a novel object-centric multi-sensor fusion framework for predicting 3D semantic occupancy. By leveraging multi-stage multi-sensor fusion, Student's t-distribution, and the T-Mixture model (TMM), together with more geometrically flexible primitives, such as the deformable superquadric (superquadric with inverse warp), the proposed method achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the nuScenes benchmark. In addition, extensive experiments were conducted on the nuScenes-C dataset to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method in different camera and lidar corruption scenarios.

Abstract: Medical document OCR is challenging due to complex layouts, domain-specific terminology, and noisy annotations, while requiring strict field-level exact matching. Existing OCR systems and general-purpose vision-language models often fail to reliably parse such documents. We propose MeDocVL, a post-trained vision-language model for query-driven medical document parsing. Our framework combines Training-driven Label Refinement to construct high-quality supervision from noisy annotations, with a Noise-aware Hybrid Post-training strategy that integrates reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning to achieve robust and precise extraction. Experiments on medical invoice benchmarks show that MeDocVL consistently outperforms conventional OCR systems and strong VLM baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance under noisy supervision.

Abstract: Insect vision supports complex behaviors including associative learning, navigation, and object detection, and has long motivated computational models for understanding biological visual processing. However, many contemporary models prioritize task performance while neglecting biologically grounded processing pathways. Here, we introduce a bio-inspired vision model that captures principles of the insect visual system to transform dense visual input into sparse, discriminative codes. The model is trained using a fully self-supervised contrastive objective, enabling representation learning without labeled data and supporting reuse across tasks without reliance on domain-specific classifiers. We evaluated the resulting representations on flower recognition tasks and natural image benchmarks. The model consistently produced reliable sparse codes that distinguish visually similar inputs. To support different modelling and deployment uses, we have implemented the model as both an artificial neural network and a spiking neural network. In a simulated localization setting, our approach outperformed a simple image downsampling comparison baseline, highlighting the functional benefit of incorporating neuromorphic visual processing pathways. Collectively, these results advance insect computational modelling by providing a generalizable bio-inspired vision model capable of sparse computation across diverse tasks.

Motivation: 激光雷达在远距离检测中存在点云稀疏问题，导致几何信息不足；而基于RGB图像深度补全的虚拟点方法虽能补充信息，但直接全部融合会增加计算成本并引入融合挑战。

Conclusion: PointViT通过选择性融合原始和虚拟点云，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了3D目标检测性能，特别是在远距离检测方面，为点云稀疏问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D object detectors often struggle to detect far-field objects due to the sparsity of point clouds at long ranges, which limits the availability of reliable geometric cues. To address this, prior approaches augment LiDAR data with depth-completed virtual points derived from RGB images; however, directly incorporating all virtual points leads to increased computational cost and introduces challenges in effectively fusing real and virtual information. We present Point Virtual Transformer (PointViT), a transformer-based 3D object detection framework that jointly reasons over raw LiDAR points and selectively sampled virtual points. The framework examines multiple fusion strategies, ranging from early point-level fusion to BEV-based gated fusion, and analyses their trade-offs in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The fused point cloud is voxelized and encoded using sparse convolutions to form a BEV representation, from which a compact set of high-confidence object queries is initialised and refined through a transformer-based context aggregation module. Experiments on the KITTI benchmark report 91.16% 3D AP, 95.94% BEV AP, and 99.36% AP on the KITTI 2D detection benchmark for the Car class.

Abstract: Human visual attention on three-dimensional objects emerges from the interplay between bottom-up geometric processing and top-down semantic recognition. Existing 3D saliency methods rely on hand-crafted geometric features or learning-based approaches that lack semantic awareness, failing to explain why humans fixate on semantically meaningful but geometrically unremarkable regions. We introduce SemGeo-AttentionNet, a dual-stream architecture that explicitly formalizes this dichotomy through asymmetric cross-modal fusion, leveraging diffusion-based semantic priors from geometry-conditioned multi-view rendering and point cloud transformers for geometric processing. Cross-attention ensures geometric features query semantic content, enabling bottom-up distinctiveness to guide top-down retrieval. We extend our framework to temporal scanpath generation through reinforcement learning, introducing the first formulation respecting 3D mesh topology with inhibition-of-return dynamics. Evaluation on SAL3D, NUS3D and 3DVA datasets demonstrates substantial improvements, validating how cognitively motivated architectures effectively model human visual attention on three-dimensional surfaces.

Abstract: Deploying GRPO on Flow Matching models has proven effective for text-to-image generation. However, existing paradigms typically propagate an outcome-based reward to all preceding denoising steps without distinguishing the local effect of each step. Moreover, current group-wise ranking mainly compares trajectories at matched timesteps and ignores within-trajectory dependencies, where certain early denoising actions can affect later states via delayed, implicit interactions. We propose TurningPoint-GRPO (TP-GRPO), a GRPO framework that alleviates step-wise reward sparsity and explicitly models long-term effects within the denoising trajectory. TP-GRPO makes two key innovations: (i) it replaces outcome-based rewards with step-level incremental rewards, providing a dense, step-aware learning signal that better isolates each denoising action's "pure" effect, and (ii) it identifies turning points-steps that flip the local reward trend and make subsequent reward evolution consistent with the overall trajectory trend-and assigns these actions an aggregated long-term reward to capture their delayed impact. Turning points are detected solely via sign changes in incremental rewards, making TP-GRPO efficient and hyperparameter-free. Extensive experiments also demonstrate that TP-GRPO exploits reward signals more effectively and consistently improves generation. Demo code is available at https://github.com/YunzeTong/TurningPoint-GRPO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流VIO系统依赖点特征，但它们在挑战性场景中性能下降，且MSCKF-based系统因特征坐标线性化误差和延迟测量更新导致定位精度受限。为了提高VIO在挑战性场景中的性能，需要开发更稳健的特征表示方法。

Method: 首先提出线特征的仅姿态几何表示，然后开发POPL-KF系统，该系统对点和线特征都使用仅姿态几何表示，以减轻线性化误差。同时设计了统一的基帧选择算法，并提出了基于图像网格分割和双向光流一致性的线特征滤波器。

Result: 在公开数据集和真实世界实验中的评估显示，POPL-KF在实时性能的同时，优于最先进的基于滤波的方法（OpenVINS, PO-KF）和基于优化的方法（PL-VINS, EPLF-VINS）。

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过使用仅姿态几何表示并改进特征处理，可以有效提升VIO系统在挑战性场景中的性能，同时保持实时运行能力。

Abstract: Mainstream Visual-inertial odometry 
(VIO) systems rely on point features for motion estimation and localization. However, their performance degrades in challenging scenarios. Moreover, the localization accuracy of multi-state constraint Kalman filter (MSCKF)-based VIO systems suffers from linearization errors associated with feature 3D coordinates and delayed measurement updates. To improve the performance of VIO in challenging scenes, we first propose a pose-only geometric representation for line features. Building on this, we develop POPL-KF, a Kalman filter-based VIO system that employs a pose-only geometric representation for both point and line features. POPL-KF mitigates linearization errors by explicitly eliminating both point and line feature coordinates from the measurement equations, while enabling immediate update of visual measurements. We also design a unified base-frames selection algorithm for both point and line features to ensure optimal constraints on camera poses within the pose-only measurement model. To further improve line feature quality, a line feature filter based on image grid segmentation and bidirectional optical flow consistency is proposed. Our system is evaluated on public datasets and real-world experiments, demonstrating that POPL-KF outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) filter-based methods (OpenVINS, PO-KF) and optimization-based methods (PL-VINS, EPLF-VINS), while maintaining real-time performance.

Abstract: Embodied navigation holds significant promise for real-world applications such as last-mile delivery. However, most existing approaches are confined to either indoor or outdoor environments and rely heavily on strong assumptions, such as access to precise coordinate systems. While current outdoor methods can guide agents to the vicinity of a target using coarse-grained localization, they fail to enable fine-grained entry through specific building entrances, critically limiting their utility in practical deployment scenarios that require seamless outdoor-to-indoor transitions. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task: out-to-in prior-free instruction-driven embodied navigation. This formulation explicitly eliminates reliance on accurate external priors, requiring agents to navigate solely based on egocentric visual observations guided by instructions. To tackle this task, we propose a vision-centric embodied navigation framework that leverages image-based prompts to drive decision-making. Additionally, we present the first open-source dataset for this task, featuring a pipeline that integrates trajectory-conditioned video synthesis into the data generation process. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across key metrics including success rate and path efficiency.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) have achieved remarkable progress yet remain constrained by a single-turn interaction paradigm, effectively functioning as solvers for independent requests rather than assistants in continuous dialogue. To bridge this gap, we present ChatUMM. As a conversational unified model, it excels at robust context tracking to sustain interleaved multimodal generation. ChatUMM derives its capabilities from two key innovations: an interleaved multi-turn training strategy that models serialized text-image streams as a continuous conversational flow, and a systematic conversational data synthesis pipeline. This pipeline transforms a diverse set of standard single-turn datasets into fluid dialogues through three progressive stages: constructing basic stateful dialogues, enforcing long-range dependency resolution via ``distractor'' turns with history-dependent query rewriting, and synthesizing naturally interleaved multimodal responses. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ChatUMM achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source unified models on visual understanding and instruction-guided editing benchmarks, while maintaining competitive fidelity in text-to-image generation. Notably, ChatUMM exhibits superior robustness in complex multi-turn scenarios, ensuring fluid, context-aware dialogues.

Abstract: Large-scale and categorical-balanced text data is essential for training effective Scene Text Recognition (STR) models, which is hard to achieve when collecting real data. Synthetic data offers a cost-effective and perfectly labeled alternative. However, its performance often lags behind, revealing a significant domain gap between real and current synthetic data. In this work, we systematically analyze mainstream rendering-based synthetic datasets and identify their key limitations: insufficient diversity in corpus, font, and layout, which restricts their realism in complex scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce UnionST, a strong data engine synthesizes text covering a union of challenging samples and better aligns with the complexity observed in the wild. We then construct UnionST-S, a large-scale synthetic dataset with improved simulations in challenging scenarios. Furthermore, we develop a self-evolution learning (SEL) framework for effective real data annotation. Experiments show that models trained on UnionST-S achieve significant improvements over existing synthetic datasets. They even surpass real-data performance in certain scenarios. Moreover, when using SEL, the trained models achieve competitive performance by only seeing 9% of real data labels.

Abstract: Detecting deepfakes has become increasingly challenging as forgery faces synthesized by AI-generated methods, particularly diffusion models, achieve unprecedented quality and resolution. Existing forgery detection approaches relying on spatial and frequency features demonstrate limited efficacy against high-quality, entirely synthesized forgeries. In this paper, we propose a novel detection method grounded in the observation that facial attributes governed by complex physical laws and multiple parameters are inherently difficult to replicate. Specifically, we focus on illumination, particularly the specular reflection component in the Phong illumination model, which poses the greatest replication challenge due to its parametric complexity and nonlinear formulation. We introduce a fast and accurate face texture estimation method based on Retinex theory to enable precise specular reflection separation. Furthermore, drawing from the mathematical formulation of specular reflection, we posit that forgery evidence manifests not only in the specular reflection itself but also in its relationship with corresponding face texture and direct light. To address this issue, we design the Specular-Reflection-Inconsistency-Network (SRI-Net), incorporating a two-stage cross-attention mechanism to capture these correlations and integrate specular reflection related features with image features for robust forgery detection. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance on both traditional deepfake datasets and generative deepfake datasets, particularly those containing diffusion-generated forgery faces.

Abstract: Foundation object detectors such as GLIP and Grounding DINO excel on general-domain data but often degrade in specialized and data-scarce settings like underwater imagery or industrial defects. Typical cross-domain few-shot approaches rely on fine-tuning scarce target data, incurring cost and overfitting risks. We instead ask: Can a frozen detector adapt with only one exemplar per class without training? To answer this, we introduce training-free one-shot domain generalization for object detection, where detectors must adapt to specialized domains with only one annotated exemplar per class and no weight updates. To tackle this task, we propose LAB-Det, which exploits Language As a domain-invariant Bridge. Instead of adapting visual features, we project each exemplar into a descriptive text that conditions and guides a frozen detector. This linguistic conditioning replaces gradient-based adaptation, enabling robust generalization in data-scarce domains. We evaluate on UODD (underwater) and NEU-DET (industrial defects), two widely adopted benchmarks for data-scarce detection, where object boundaries are often ambiguous, and LAB-Det achieves up to 5.4 mAP improvement over state-of-the-art fine-tuned baselines without updating a single parameter. These results establish linguistic adaptation as an efficient and interpretable alternative to fine-tuning in specialized detection settings.

Abstract: Inferring the 3D structure from a single image, particularly in occluded regions, remains a fundamental yet unsolved challenge in vision-centric autonomous driving. Existing unsupervised approaches typically train a neural radiance field and treat the network outputs as occupancy probabilities during evaluation, overlooking the inconsistency between training and evaluation protocols. Moreover, the prevalent use of 2D ground truth fails to reveal the inherent ambiguity in occluded regions caused by insufficient geometric constraints. To address these issues, this paper presents a reformulated benchmark for unsupervised monocular 3D occupancy prediction. We first interpret the variables involved in the volume rendering process and identify the most physically consistent representation of the occupancy probability. Building on these analyses, we improve existing evaluation protocols by aligning the newly identified representation with voxel-wise 3D occupancy ground truth, thereby enabling unsupervised methods to be evaluated in a manner consistent with that of supervised approaches. Additionally, to impose explicit constraints in occluded regions, we introduce an occlusion-aware polarization mechanism that incorporates multi-view visual cues to enhance discrimination between occupied and free spaces in these regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach not only significantly outperforms existing unsupervised approaches but also matches the performance of supervised ones. Our source code and evaluation protocol will be made available upon publication.

Abstract: In modern interior design, the generation of personalized spaces frequently necessitates a delicate balance between rigid architectural structural constraints and specific stylistic preferences. However, existing multi-condition generative frameworks often struggle to harmonize these inputs, leading to "condition conflicts" where stylistic attributes inadvertently compromise the geometric precision of the layout. To address this challenge, we present DreamHome-Pano, a controllable panoramic generation framework designed for high-fidelity interior synthesis. Our approach introduces a Prompt-LLM that serves as a semantic bridge, effectively translating layout constraints and style references into professional descriptive prompts to achieve precise cross-modal alignment. To safeguard architectural integrity during the generative process, we develop a Conflict-Free Control architecture that incorporates structural-aware geometric priors and a multi-condition decoupling strategy, effectively suppressing stylistic interference from eroding the spatial layout. Furthermore, we establish a comprehensive panoramic interior benchmark alongside a multi-stage training pipeline, encompassing progressive Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Experimental results demonstrate that DreamHome-Pano achieves a superior balance between aesthetic quality and structural consistency, offering a robust and professional-grade solution for panoramic interior visualization.

Conclusion: DriveWorld-VLA成功地将世界建模和规划统一在潜在空间，使VLA规划器能够从整体场景演化建模中直接受益，并通过行动条件想象评估候选行动对未来的影响，提升了自动驾驶决策质量。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) autonomous driving has recently attracted increasing interest in unifying Vision-Language-Action (VLA) with World Models to enhance decision-making and forward-looking imagination. However, existing methods fail to effectively unify future scene evolution and action planning within a single architecture due to inadequate sharing of latent states, limiting the impact of visual imagination on action decisions. To address this limitation, we propose DriveWorld-VLA, a novel framework that unifies world modeling and planning within a latent space by tightly integrating VLA and world models at the representation level, which enables the VLA planner to benefit directly from holistic scene-evolution modeling and reducing reliance on dense annotated supervision. Additionally, DriveWorld-VLA incorporates the latent states of the world model as core decision-making states for the VLA planner, facilitating the planner to assess how candidate actions impact future scene evolution. By conducting world modeling entirely in the latent space, DriveWorld-VLA supports controllable, action-conditioned imagination at the feature level, avoiding expensive pixel-level rollouts. Extensive open-loop and closed-loop evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of DriveWorld-VLA, which achieves state-of-the-art performance with 91.3 PDMS on NAVSIMv1, 86.8 EPDMS on NAVSIMv2, and 0.16 3-second average collision rate on nuScenes.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) on resource constrained wearables requires models that balance accuracy against strict memory and computational budgets. State of the art lightweight architectures such as TinierHAR (34K parameters) and TinyHAR (55K parameters) achieve strong accuracy, but exceed memory budgets of microcontrollers with limited SRAM once operating system overhead is considered. We present MicroBi-ConvLSTM, an ultra-lightweight convolutional-recurrent architecture achieving 11.4K parameters on average through two stage convolutional feature extraction with 4x temporal pooling and a single bidirectional LSTM layer. This represents 2.9x parameter reduction versus TinierHAR and 11.9x versus DeepConvLSTM while preserving linear O(N) complexity. Evaluation across eight diverse HAR benchmarks shows that MicroBi-ConvLSTM maintains competitive performance within the ultra-lightweight regime: 93.41% macro F1 on UCI-HAR, 94.46% on SKODA assembly gestures, and 88.98% on Daphnet gait freeze detection. Systematic ablation reveals task dependent component contributions where bidirectionality benefits episodic event detection, but provides marginal gains on periodic locomotion. INT8 post training quantization incurs only 0.21% average F1-score degradation, yielding a 23.0 KB average deployment footprint suitable for memory constrained edge devices.

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection plays a pivotal role in domains such as environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster assessment. However, existing methods typically rely on predefined categories and large-scale pixel-level annotations, which limit their generalization and applicability in open-world scenarios. To address these limitations, this paper proposes AdaptOVCD, a training-free Open-Vocabulary Change Detection (OVCD) architecture based on dual-dimensional multi-level information fusion. The framework integrates multi-level information fusion across data, feature, and decision levels vertically while incorporating targeted adaptive designs horizontally, achieving deep synergy among heterogeneous pre-trained models to effectively mitigate error propagation. Specifically, (1) at the data level, Adaptive Radiometric Alignment (ARA) fuses radiometric statistics with original texture features and synergizes with SAM-HQ to achieve radiometrically consistent segmentation; (2) at the feature level, Adaptive Change Thresholding (ACT) combines global difference distributions with edge structure priors and leverages DINOv3 to achieve robust change detection; (3) at the decision level, Adaptive Confidence Filtering (ACF) integrates semantic confidence with spatial constraints and collaborates with DGTRS-CLIP to achieve high-confidence semantic identification. Comprehensive evaluations across nine scenarios demonstrate that AdaptOVCD detects arbitrary category changes in a zero-shot manner, significantly outperforming existing training-free methods. Meanwhile, it achieves 84.89\% of the fully-supervised performance upper bound in cross-dataset evaluations and exhibits superior generalization capabilities.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of AI-Generated Content (AIGC) technologies poses significant challenges for authenticity assessment. However, existing evaluation protocols largely overlook anti-forensics attack, failing to ensure the comprehensive robustness of state-of-the-art AIGC detectors in real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we propose ForgeryEraser, a framework designed to execute universal anti-forensics attack without access to the target AIGC detectors. We reveal an adversarial vulnerability stemming from the systemic reliance on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) as shared backbones (e.g., CLIP), where downstream AIGC detectors inherit the feature space of these publicly accessible models. Instead of traditional logit-based optimization, we design a multi-modal guidance loss to drive forged image embeddings within the VLM feature space toward text-derived authentic anchors to erase forgery traces, while repelling them from forgery anchors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ForgeryEraser causes substantial performance degradation to advanced AIGC detectors on both global synthesis and local editing benchmarks. Moreover, ForgeryEraser induces explainable forensic models to generate explanations consistent with authentic images for forged images. Our code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Motion tokenization is a key component of generalizable motion models, yet most existing approaches are restricted to species-specific skeletons, limiting their applicability across diverse morphologies. We propose NECromancer (NEC), a universal motion tokenizer that operates directly on arbitrary BVH skeletons. NEC consists of three components: (1) an Ontology-aware Skeletal Graph Encoder (OwO) that encodes structural priors from BVH files, including joint semantics, rest-pose offsets, and skeletal topology, into skeletal embeddings; (2) a Topology-Agnostic Tokenizer (TAT) that compresses motion sequences into a universal, topology-invariant discrete representation; and (3) the Unified BVH Universe (UvU), a large-scale dataset aggregating BVH motions across heterogeneous skeletons. Experiments show that NEC achieves high-fidelity reconstruction under substantial compression and effectively disentangles motion from skeletal structure. The resulting token space supports cross-species motion transfer, composition, denoising, generation with token-based models, and text-motion retrieval, establishing a unified framework for motion analysis and synthesis across diverse morphologies.

Abstract: Reliable benchmarking is critical for advancing Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, as it reveals their generalization, robustness, and alignment of perception with language-driven manipulation tasks. However, existing benchmarks often provide limited or misleading assessments due to insufficient evaluation protocols that inadequately capture real-world distribution shifts. This work systematically rethinks VLA benchmarking from both evaluation and data perspectives, introducing LIBERO-X, a benchmark featuring: 1) A hierarchical evaluation protocol with progressive difficulty levels targeting three core capabilities: spatial generalization, object recognition, and task instruction understanding. This design enables fine-grained analysis of performance degradation under increasing environmental and task complexity; 2) A high-diversity training dataset collected via human teleoperation, where each scene supports multiple fine-grained manipulation objectives to bridge the train-evaluation distribution gap. Experiments with representative VLA models reveal significant performance drops under cumulative perturbations, exposing persistent limitations in scene comprehension and instruction grounding. By integrating hierarchical evaluation with diverse training data, LIBERO-X offers a more reliable foundation for assessing and advancing VLA development.

Abstract: Despite recent successes, test-time scaling - i.e., dynamically expanding the token budget during inference as needed - remains brittle for vision-language models (VLMs): unstructured chains-of-thought about images entangle perception and reasoning, leading to long, disorganized contexts where small perceptual mistakes may cascade into completely wrong answers. Moreover, expensive reinforcement learning with hand-crafted rewards is required to achieve good performance. Here, we introduce SPARC (Separating Perception And Reasoning Circuits), a modular framework that explicitly decouples visual perception from reasoning. Inspired by sequential sensory-to-cognitive processing in the brain, SPARC implements a two-stage pipeline where the model first performs explicit visual search to localize question-relevant regions, then conditions its reasoning on those regions to produce the final answer. This separation enables independent test-time scaling with asymmetric compute allocation (e.g., prioritizing perceptual processing under distribution shift), supports selective optimization (e.g., improving the perceptual stage alone when it is the bottleneck for end-to-end performance), and accommodates compressed contexts by running global search at lower image resolutions and allocating high-resolution processing only to selected regions, thereby reducing total visual tokens count and compute. Across challenging visual reasoning benchmarks, SPARC outperforms monolithic baselines and strong visual-grounding approaches. For instance, SPARC improves the accuracy of Qwen3VL-4B on the $V^*$ VQA benchmark by 6.7 percentage points, and it surpasses "thinking with images" by 4.6 points on a challenging OOD task despite requiring a 200$\times$ lower token budget.

Abstract: The task of establishing correspondences between two 3D shapes is a long-standing challenge in computer vision. While numerous studies address full-full and partial-full 3D shape matching, only a limited number of works have explored the partial-partial setting, very likely due to its unique challenges: we must compute accurate correspondences while at the same time find the unknown overlapping region. Nevertheless, partial-partial 3D shape matching reflects the most realistic setting, as in many real-world cases, such as 3D scanning, shapes are only partially observable. In this work, we introduce the first integer linear programming approach specifically designed to address the distinctive challenges of partial-partial shape matching. Our method leverages geometric consistency as a strong prior, enabling both robust estimation of the overlapping region and computation of neighbourhood-preserving correspondences. We empirically demonstrate that our approach achieves high-quality matching results both in terms of matching error and smoothness. Moreover, we show that our method is more scalable than previous formalisms.

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become a dominant architecture in computer vision, yet producing stable and high-resolution attribution maps for these models remains challenging. Architectural components such as patch embeddings and attention routing often introduce structured artifacts in pixel-level explanations, causing many existing methods to rely on coarse patch-level attributions. We introduce DAVE \textit{(\underline{D}istribution-aware \underline{A}ttribution via \underline{V}iT Gradient D\underline{E}composition)}, a mathematically grounded attribution method for ViTs based on a structured decomposition of the input gradient. By exploiting architectural properties of ViTs, DAVE isolates locally equivariant and stable components of the effective input--output mapping. It separates these from architecture-induced artifacts and other sources of instability.

Method: 提出CauCLIP因果引导的视觉-语言框架，整合两个关键组件：1）基于频率的数据增强策略，扰动领域特定属性同时保留语义结构；2）因果抑制损失，缓解非因果偏置并强化因果手术特征。整个统一训练框架使模型关注手术工作流程的稳定因果因素。

Conclusion: 通过整合因果推理与视觉-语言表示学习，CauCLIP框架能够学习领域不变表示，有效解决手术阶段识别中的领域泛化问题，为跨域手术视频理解提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Surgical phase recognition is a critical component for context-aware decision support in intelligent operating rooms, yet training robust models is hindered by limited annotated clinical videos and large domain gaps between synthetic and real surgical data. To address this, we propose CauCLIP, a causality-inspired vision-language framework that leverages CLIP to learn domain-invariant representations for surgical phase recognition without access to target domain data. Our approach integrates a frequency-based augmentation strategy to perturb domain-specific attributes while preserving semantic structures, and a causal suppression loss that mitigates non-causal biases and reinforces causal surgical features. These components are combined in a unified training framework that enables the model to focus on stable causal factors underlying surgical workflows. Experiments on the SurgVisDom hard adaptation benchmark demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms all competing approaches, highlighting the effectiveness of causality-guided vision-language models for domain-generalizable surgical video understanding.

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) have shown impressive capabilities in generating natural images and supporting multimodal reasoning. However, their potential in supporting computer-use planning tasks, which are closely related to our lives, remain underexplored. Image generation and editing in computer-use tasks require capabilities like spatial reasoning and procedural understanding, and it is still unknown whether UMMs have these capabilities to finish these tasks or not. Therefore, we propose PlanViz, a new benchmark designed to evaluate image generation and editing for computer-use tasks. To achieve the goal of our evaluation, we focus on sub-tasks which frequently involve in daily life and require planning steps. Specifically, three new sub-tasks are designed: route planning, work diagramming, and web&UI displaying. We address challenges in data quality ensuring by curating human-annotated questions and reference images, and a quality control process. For challenges of comprehensive and exact evaluation, a task-adaptive score, PlanScore, is proposed. The score helps understanding the correctness, visual quality and efficiency of generated images. Through experiments, we highlight key limitations and opportunities for future research on this topic.

Abstract: High-quality annotated datasets are crucial for advancing machine learning in medical image analysis. However, a critical gap exists: most datasets either offer a single, clean ground truth, which hides real-world expert disagreement, or they provide multiple annotations without a separate gold standard for objective evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce CytoCrowd, a new public benchmark for cytology analysis. The dataset features 446 high-resolution images, each with two key components: (1) raw, conflicting annotations from four independent pathologists, and (2) a separate, high-quality gold-standard ground truth established by a senior expert. This dual structure makes CytoCrowd a versatile resource. It serves as a benchmark for standard computer vision tasks, such as object detection and classification, using the ground truth. Simultaneously, it provides a realistic testbed for evaluating annotation aggregation algorithms that must resolve expert disagreements. We provide comprehensive baseline results for both tasks. Our experiments demonstrate the challenges presented by CytoCrowd and establish its value as a resource for developing the next generation of models for medical image analysis.

Conclusion: 提出的SICA是首个实用的一体化FID范式，有效解决了跨伪造子领域的统一检测问题，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Fake Image Detection (FID), aiming at unified detection across four image forensic subdomains, is critical in real-world forensic scenarios. Compared with ensemble approaches, monolithic FID models are theoretically more promising, but to date, consistently yield inferior performance in practice. In this work, by discovering the ``heterogeneous phenomenon'', which is the intrinsic distinctness of artifacts across subdomains, we diagnose the cause of this underperformance for the first time: the collapse of the artifact feature space driven by such phenomenon. The core challenge for developing a practical monolithic FID model thus boils down to the ``unified-yet-discriminative" reconstruction of the artifact feature space. To address this paradoxical challenge, we hypothesize that high-level semantics can serve as a structural prior for the reconstruction, and further propose Semantic-Induced Constrained Adaptation (SICA), the first monolithic FID paradigm. Extensive experiments on our OpenMMSec dataset demonstrate that SICA outperforms 15 state-of-the-art methods and reconstructs the target unified-yet-discriminative artifact feature space in a near-orthogonal manner, thus firmly validating our hypothesis.

Abstract: Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis (AIS) is a prevalent spinal deformity whose progression can be mitigated through early detection. Conventional screening methods are often subjective, difficult to scale, and reliant on specialized clinical expertise. Video-based gait analysis offers a promising alternative, but current datasets and methods frequently suffer from data leakage, where performance is inflated by repeated clips from the same individual, or employ oversimplified models that lack clinical interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce ScoliGait, a new benchmark dataset comprising 1,572 gait video clips for training and 300 fully independent clips for testing. Each clip is annotated with radiographic Cobb angles and descriptive text based on clinical kinematic priors. We propose a multi-modal framework that integrates a clinical-prior-guided kinematic knowledge map for interpretable feature representation, alongside a latent attention pooling mechanism to fuse video, text, and knowledge map modalities. Our method establishes a new state-of-the-art, demonstrating a significant performance gap on a realistic, non-repeating subject benchmark. Our approach establishes a new state of the art, showing a significant performance gain on a realistic, subject-independent benchmark. This work provides a robust, interpretable, and clinically grounded foundation for scalable, non-invasive AIS assessment.

Abstract: Satellite imagery is employed for large-scale prospectivity mapping due to the high cost and typically limited availability of on-site mineral exploration data. In this work, we present a proof-of-concept framework that leverages generative representations learned from multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery to identify gold-bearing regions from space. An autoencoder foundation model, called Isometric, which is pretrained on the large-scale FalconSpace-S2 v1.0 dataset, produces information-dense spectral-spatial representations that serve as inputs to a lightweight XGBoost classifier. We compare this representation-based approach with a raw spectral input baseline using a dataset of 63 Sentinel-2 images from known gold and non-gold locations. The proposed method improves patch-level accuracy from 0.51 to 0.68 and image-level accuracy from 0.55 to 0.73, demonstrating that generative embeddings capture transferable mineralogical patterns even with limited labeled data. These results highlight the potential of foundation-model representations to make mineral exploration more efficient, scalable, and globally applicable.

Abstract: Facial emotion recognition has been typically cast as a single-label classification problem of one out of six prototypical emotions. However, that is an oversimplification that is unsuitable for representing the multifaceted spectrum of spontaneous emotional states, which are most often the result of a combination of multiple emotions contributing at different intensities. Building on this, a promising direction that was explored recently is to cast emotion recognition as a distribution learning problem. Still, such approaches are limited in that research datasets are typically annotated with a single emotion class. In this paper, we contribute a novel approach to describe complex emotional states as probability distributions over a set of emotion classes. To do so, we propose a solution to automatically re-label existing datasets by exploiting the result of a study in which a large set of both basic and compound emotions is mapped to probability distributions in the Valence-Arousal-Dominance (VAD) space. In this way, given a face image annotated with VAD values, we can estimate the likelihood of it belonging to each of the distributions, so that emotional states can be described as a mixture of emotions, enriching their description, while also accounting for the ambiguous nature of their perception. In a preliminary set of experiments, we illustrate the advantages of this solution and a new possible direction of investigation.

Abstract: Sweetpotato weevils (Cylas spp.) are considered among the most destructive pests impacting sweetpotato production, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Traditional methods for assessing weevil damage, predominantly relying on manual scoring, are labour-intensive, subjective, and often yield inconsistent results. These challenges significantly hinder breeding programs aimed at developing resilient sweetpotato varieties. This study introduces a computer vision-based approach for the automated evaluation of weevil damage in both field and laboratory contexts. In the field settings, we collected data to train classification models to predict root-damage severity levels, achieving a test accuracy of 71.43%. Additionally, we established a laboratory dataset and designed an object detection pipeline employing YOLO12, a leading real-time detection model. This methodology incorporated a two-stage laboratory pipeline that combined root segmentation with a tiling strategy to improve the detectability of small objects. The resulting model demonstrated a mean average precision of 77.7% in identifying minute weevil feeding holes. Our findings indicate that computer vision technologies can provide efficient, objective, and scalable assessment tools that align seamlessly with contemporary breeding workflows. These advancements represent a significant improvement in enhancing phenotyping efficiency within sweetpotato breeding programs and play a crucial role in mitigating the detrimental effects of weevils on food security.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models achieve impressive generation quality but inherit and amplify training-data biases, skewing coverage of semantic attributes. Prior work addresses this in two ways. Closed-set approaches mitigate biases in predefined fairness categories (e.g., gender, race), assuming socially salient minority attributes are known a priori. Open-set approaches frame the task as bias identification, highlighting majority attributes that dominate outputs. Both overlook a complementary task: uncovering rare or minority features underrepresented in the data distribution (social, cultural, or stylistic) yet still encoded in model representations. We introduce RAIGen, the first framework, to our knowledge, for un-supervised rare-attribute discovery in diffusion models. RAIGen leverages Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoders and a novel minority metric combining neuron activation frequency with semantic distinctiveness to identify interpretable neurons whose top-activating images reveal underrepresented attributes. Experiments show RAIGen discovers attributes beyond fixed fairness categories in Stable Diffusion, scales to larger models such as SDXL, supports systematic auditing across architectures, and enables targeted amplification of rare attributes during generation.

Abstract: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting simplification methods commonly use importance scores, such as blending weights or sensitivity, to identify redundant Gaussians. However, these scores are not driven by visual error metrics, often leading to suboptimal trade-offs between compactness and rendering fidelity. We present GaussianPOP, a principled simplification framework based on analytical Gaussian error quantification. Our key contribution is a novel error criterion, derived directly from the 3DGS rendering equation, that precisely measures each Gaussian's contribution to the rendered image. By introducing a highly efficient algorithm, our framework enables practical error calculation in a single forward pass. The framework is both accurate and flexible, supporting on-training pruning as well as post-training simplification via iterative error re-quantification for improved stability. Experimental results show that our method consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art pruning methods across both application scenarios, achieving a superior trade-off between model compactness and high rendering quality.

Conclusion: 该框架通过消除跨模态交互冗余，有效解决了多条件控制的计算瓶颈问题，在保持生成质量的同时显著提升了效率

Abstract: While modern text-to-image models excel at prompt-based generation, they often lack the fine-grained control necessary for specific user requirements like spatial layouts or subject appearances. Multi-condition control addresses this, yet its integration into Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) is bottlenecked by the conventional ``concatenate-and-attend'' strategy, which suffers from quadratic computational and memory overhead as the number of conditions scales. Our analysis reveals that much of this cross-modal interaction is spatially or semantically redundant. To this end, we propose Position-aligned and Keyword-scoped Attention (PKA), a highly efficient framework designed to eliminate these redundancies. Specifically, Position-Aligned Attention (PAA) linearizes spatial control by enforcing localized patch alignment, while Keyword-Scoped Attention (KSA) prunes irrelevant subject-driven interactions via semantic-aware masking. To facilitate efficient learning, we further introduce a Conditional Sensitivity-Aware Sampling (CSAS) strategy that reweights the training objective towards critical denoising phases, drastically accelerating convergence and enhancing conditional fidelity. Empirically, PKA delivers a 10.0$\times$ inference speedup and a 5.1$\times$ VRAM saving, providing a scalable and resource-friendly solution for high-fidelity multi-conditioned generation.

Abstract: Adapting pre-trained vision models using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) remains challenging, as it aims to achieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning using a minimal number of trainable parameters. When applied to complex dense prediction tasks, existing methods exhibit limitations, including input-agnostic modeling and redundant cross-layer representations. To this end, we propose AdaRoute, a new adapter-style method featuring a simple mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture. Specifically, we introduce shared expert centers, where each expert is a trainable parameter matrix. During a feedforward pass, each AdaRoute module in the network dynamically generates weight matrices tailored for the current module via a simple dynamic parameter routing mechanism, which selectively aggregates parameter matrices in the corresponding expert center. Dynamic weight matrices in AdaRoute modules facilitate low-rank adaptation in an input-dependent manner, thus generating more customized and powerful feature representations. Moreover, since AdaRoute modules across multiple network layers share the same expert center, they improve feature diversity by promoting implicit cross-layer feature interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of AdaRoute on diverse vision tasks, including semantic segmentation, object detection and instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation. Code will be available at: https://bit.ly/3NZcr0H.

Abstract: Instructional video editing applies edits to an input video using only text prompts, enabling intuitive natural-language control. Despite rapid progress, most methods still require fixed-length inputs and substantial compute. Meanwhile, autoregressive video generation enables efficient variable-length synthesis, yet remains under-explored for video editing. We introduce a causal, efficient video editing model that edits variable-length videos frame by frame. For efficiency, we start from a 2D image-to-image (I2I) diffusion model and adapt it to video-to-video (V2V) editing by conditioning the edit at time step t on the model's prediction at t-1. To leverage videos' temporal redundancy, we propose a new I2I diffusion forward process formulation that encourages the model to predict the residual between the target output and the previous prediction. We call this Residual Flow Diffusion Model (RFDM), which focuses the denoising process on changes between consecutive frames. Moreover, we propose a new benchmark that better ranks state-of-the-art methods for editing tasks. Trained on paired video data for global/local style transfer and object removal, RFDM surpasses I2I-based methods and competes with fully spatiotemporal (3D) V2V models, while matching the compute of image models and scaling independently of input video length.

Abstract: While large-scale text-to-image diffusion models continue to improve in visual quality, their increasing scale has widened the gap between state-of-the-art models and on-device solutions. To address this gap, we introduce NanoFLUX, a 2.4B text-to-image flow-matching model distilled from 17B FLUX.1-Schnell using a progressive compression pipeline designed to preserve generation quality. Our contributions include: (1) A model compression strategy driven by pruning redundant components in the diffusion transformer, reducing its size from 12B to 2B; (2) A ResNet-based token downsampling mechanism that reduces latency by allowing intermediate blocks to operate on lower-resolution tokens while preserving high-resolution processing elsewhere; (3) A novel text encoder distillation approach that leverages visual signals from early layers of the denoiser during sampling. Empirically, NanoFLUX generates 512 x 512 images in approximately 2.5 seconds on mobile devices, demonstrating the feasibility of high-quality on-device text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiTs) for text-to-image generation maintain separate text and image branches, with bidirectional information flow between text tokens and visual latents throughout denoising. In this setting, we observe a prompt forgetting phenomenon: the semantics of the prompt representation in the text branch is progressively forgotten as depth increases. We further verify this effect on three representative MMDiTs--SD3, SD3.5, and FLUX.1 by probing linguistic attributes of the representations over the layers in the text branch. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a training-free approach, prompt reinjection, which reinjects prompt representations from early layers into later layers to alleviate this forgetting. Experiments on GenEval, DPG, and T2I-CompBench++ show consistent gains in instruction-following capability, along with improvements on metrics capturing preference, aesthetics, and overall text--image generation quality.

*Juan Gutiérrez,Victor Gutiérrez-Garcia,José Luis Blanco-Murillo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PANC是一种弱监督光谱分割框架，通过少量标注的视觉标记来生成稳定、可控、可重复的对象掩码，显著提升分割质量与可重复性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 完全无监督分割方法通常是非确定性的，对初始化、种子顺序和阈值启发式敏感。为了解决这些问题，提出一种使用少量标注视觉标记的弱监督分割框架。

Method: 基于TokenCut方法，在标记-标记亲和力图中加入少量锚节点先验知识。通过操纵图拓扑结构，使谱特征空间偏向与标注一致的分割结果。方法保持全局分组特性，以少量标注换取可重复性和控制性。

Result: 在每个数据集使用5到30个标注的情况下，该无训练方法在多个基准测试（DUTS-TE、ECSSD、MS COCO）中达到最先进的弱监督和无监督方法性能。在细粒度、纹理有限的数据集上表现优异：CrackForest（96.8% mIoU）、CUB-200-2011（78.0% mIoU）、HAM10000（78.8% mIoU）。在多对象基准测试中展示了明确的用户可控语义分割能力。

Conclusion: PANC框架通过少量标注实现了稳定、可控、可重复的对象分割，在保持全局分组特性的同时，解决了传统无监督方法的不确定性问题，在多种挑战性数据集上表现出色。

Abstract: Fully unsupervised segmentation pipelines naively seek the most salient object, should this be present. As a result, most of the methods reported in the literature deliver non-deterministic partitions that are sensitive to initialization, seed order, and threshold heuristics.
  We propose PANC, a weakly supervised spectral segmentation framework that uses a minimal set of annotated visual tokens to produce stable, controllable, and reproducible object masks. From the TokenCut approach, we augment the token-token affinity graph with a handful of priors coupled to anchor nodes. By manipulating the graph topology, we bias the spectral eigenspace toward partitions that are consistent with the annotations. Our approach preserves the global grouping enforced by dense self-supervised visual features, trading annotated tokens for significant gains in reproducibility, user control, and segmentation quality.
  Using 5 to 30 annotations per dataset, our training-free method achieves state-of-the-art performance among weakly and unsupervised approaches on standard benchmarks (e.g., DUTS-TE, ECSSD, MS COCO). Contrarily, it excels in domains where dense labels are costly or intra-class differences are subtle. We report strong and reliable results on homogeneous, fine-grained, and texture-limited domains, achieving 96.8% (+14.43% over SotA), 78.0% (+0.2%), and 78.8% (+0.37%) average mean intersection-over-union (mIoU) on CrackForest (CFD), CUB-200-2011, and HAM10000 datasets, respectively. For multi-object benchmarks, the framework showcases explicit, user-controllable semantic segmentation.

TL;DR: 本文探讨了视觉大语言模型(VLLMs)为何在细粒度视觉信息处理和空间推理任务上表现不佳，通过构建合成基准数据集来研究视觉冗余和压缩机制，发现任务复杂度与视觉压缩程度有关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VLLMs的视觉能力一直落后于语言能力，尤其在需要细粒度视觉信息或空间推理的任务上表现不佳。现有研究用视觉冗余（高级视觉信息均匀分布在多个token中，细粒度信息被丢弃）解释这一现象，但缺乏对具体机制的理解。本文旨在深入探究视觉信息在VLLMs中的处理方式。

Method: 1. 构建一个专门设计用于探测各种视觉特征的合成基准数据集；2. 引入一套衡量视觉冗余的指标；3. 在多个复杂视觉任务上对VLLMs进行微调，研究不同数据复杂度下冗余和压缩的变化。

Result: 研究发现任务复杂度与视觉压缩程度存在关联：模型的视觉表示分布方式会因任务复杂度而改变。训练数据中具有足够比例的高复杂度视觉数据对于改善VLLMs在复杂视觉任务上的表现至关重要。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了VLLMs处理视觉信息的机制，特别是冗余和压缩与任务复杂度的关系，为训练下一代VLLMs提供了有价值的设计见解。

Abstract: Vision capabilities in vision large language models (VLLMs) have consistently lagged behind their linguistic capabilities. In particular, numerous benchmark studies have demonstrated that VLLMs struggle when fine-grained visual information or spatial reasoning is required. However, we do not yet understand exactly why VLLMs struggle so much with these tasks relative to others. Some works have focused on visual redundancy as an explanation, where high-level visual information is uniformly spread across numerous tokens and specific, fine-grained visual information is discarded. In this work, we investigate this premise in greater detail, seeking to better understand exactly how various types of visual information are processed by the model and what types of visual information are discarded. To do so, we introduce a simple synthetic benchmark dataset that is specifically constructed to probe various visual features, along with a set of metrics for measuring visual redundancy, allowing us to better understand the nuances of their relationship. Then, we explore fine-tuning VLLMs on a number of complex visual tasks to better understand how redundancy and compression change based upon the complexity of the data that a model is trained on. We find that there is a connection between task complexity and visual compression, implying that having a sufficient ratio of high complexity visual data is crucial for altering the way that VLLMs distribute their visual representation and consequently improving their performance on complex visual tasks. We hope that this work will provide valuable insights for training the next generation of VLLMs.

Abstract: Cinematic video production requires control over scene-subject composition and camera movement, but live-action shooting remains costly due to the need for constructing physical sets. To address this, we introduce the task of cinematic video generation with decoupled scene context: given multiple images of a static environment, the goal is to synthesize high-quality videos featuring dynamic subject while preserving the underlying scene consistency and following a user-specified camera trajectory. We present CineScene, a framework that leverages implicit 3D-aware scene representation for cinematic video generation. Our key innovation is a novel context conditioning mechanism that injects 3D-aware features in an implicit way: By encoding scene images into visual representations through VGGT, CineScene injects spatial priors into a pretrained text-to-video generation model by additional context concatenation, enabling camera-controlled video synthesis with consistent scenes and dynamic subjects. To further enhance the model's robustness, we introduce a simple yet effective random-shuffling strategy for the input scene images during training. To address the lack of training data, we construct a scene-decoupled dataset with Unreal Engine 5, containing paired videos of scenes with and without dynamic subjects, panoramic images representing the underlying static scene, along with their camera trajectories. Experiments show that CineScene achieves state-of-the-art performance in scene-consistent cinematic video generation, handling large camera movements and demonstrating generalization across diverse environments.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced, yet their adoption in medicine remains limited by gaps in domain coverage, modality alignment, and grounded reasoning. In this work, we introduce MedMO, a medical foundation model built upon a generalized MLLM architecture and trained exclusively on large-scale, domain-specific data. MedMO follows a multi-stage training recipe: (i) cross-modal pretraining to align heterogeneous visual encoders with a medical language backbone; (ii) instruction tuning on multi-task supervision that spans captioning, VQA, report generation, retrieval, and grounded disease localization with bounding boxes; and (iii) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards that combine factuality checks with a box-level GIoU reward to strengthen spatial grounding and step-by-step reasoning in complex clinical scenarios. MedMO consistently outperforms strong open-source medical MLLMs across multiple modalities and tasks. On VQA benchmarks, MedMO achieves an average accuracy improvement of +13.7% over the baseline and performs within 1.9% of the SOTA Fleming-VL. For text-based QA, it attains +6.9% over the baseline and +14.5% over Fleming-VL. In medical report generation, MedMO delivers significant gains in both semantic and clinical accuracy. Moreover, it exhibits strong grounding capability, achieving an IoU improvement of +40.4 over the baseline and +37.0% over Fleming-VL, underscoring its robust spatial reasoning and localization performance. Evaluations across radiology, ophthalmology, and pathology-microscopy confirm MedMO's broad cross-modality generalization. We release two versions of MedMO: 4B and 8B.

Abstract: This paper proposes a quantum framework for the design of communication topologies in consensus-based multi-agent systems. The communication graph is selected online by solving a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP) that minimizes a cost combining communication and distance penalties with degree-regularization terms, while enforcing exact connectivity through a flow-based formulation. To cope with the combinatorial complexity of this NP-hard problem, we develop a three-block ADMM scheme that decomposes the MIQP into a convex quadratic program in relaxed edge and flow variables, a pure binary unconstrained subproblem, and a closed-form auxiliary update. The binary subproblem is mapped to a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) Hamiltonian and approximately solved via quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE). The resulting time-varying, optimizer-generated Laplacians are applied to linear first- and second-order consensus dynamics. Numerical simulations on networks demonstrate that the proposed method produces connected topologies that satisfy degree constraints, achieve consensus, and incur costs comparable to those of classical mixed-integer solvers, thereby illustrating how quantum algorithms can be embedded as topology optimizers within closed-loop distributed control architectures.

Abstract: The existing literature on Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) predominantly focuses on two main areas: control system design aimed at achieving grid stability and the techno-economic analysis of BESS dispatch on power grid. However, with the increasing incorporation of ancillary services into power grids, a more comprehensive approach to energy management systems is required. Such an approach should not only optimize revenue generation from BESS but also ensure the safe, efficient, and reliable operation of lithium-ion batteries. This research seeks to bridge this gap by exploring literature that addresses both the economic and operational dimensions of BESS. Specifically, it examines how economic aspects of grid duty cycles can align with control schemes deployed in BESS systems. This alignment, or synergy, could be instrumental in creating robust digital twins virtual representations of BESS systems that enhance both grid stability and revenue potential.
  The literature review is organized into five key categories: (1) ancillary services for BESS, exploring support functions that BESS can provide to power grids; (2) control systems developed for real-time BESS power flow management, ensuring smooth operations under dynamic grid conditions; (3) optimization algorithms for BESS dispatch, focusing on efficient energy allocation strategies; (4) techno-economic analyses of BESS and battery systems to assess their financial viability; and (5) digital twin technologies for real-world BESS deployments, enabling advanced predictive maintenance and performance optimization. This review will identify potential synergies, research gaps, and emerging trends, paving the way for future innovations in BESS management and deployment strategies.

Abstract: This work develops a theoretical framework for safety controller synthesis in discrete-time stochastic nonlinear polynomial systems subject to time-invariant delays (dt-SNPS-td). While safety analysis of stochastic systems using control barrier certificates (CBC) has been widely studied, developing safety controllers for stochastic systems with time delays remains largely unexplored. The main challenge arises from the need to account for the influence of delayed components when formulating and enforcing safety conditions. To address this, we employ Krasovskii control barrier certificates, which extend the conventional CBC framework by augmenting it with an additional summation term that captures the influence of delayed states. This formulation integrates both the current and delayed components into a unified barrier structure, enabling safety synthesis for stochastic systems with time delays. The proposed approach synthesizes safety controllers under input constraints, offering probabilistic safety guarantees robust to such delays: it ensures that all trajectories of the dt-SNPS-td remain within the prescribed safe region while fulfilling a quantified probabilistic bound. To achieve this, our method reformulates the safety constraints as a sum-of-squares optimization program, enabling the systematic construction of Krasovskii CBC together with their associated safety controllers. We validate the proposed framework through three case studies, including two physical systems, demonstrating its effectiveness and practical applicability.

Abstract: Precise magnetic field modeling is fundamental to the closed-loop control of electromagnetic navigation systems (eMNS) and the analytical Multipole Expansion Model (MPEM) is the current standard. However, the MPEM relies on strict physical assumptions regarding source symmetry and isolation, and requires optimization-based calibration that is highly sensitive to initialization. These constraints limit its applicability to systems with complex or irregular coil geometries. This work introduces an alternative modeling paradigm based on multi-layer perceptrons that learns nonlinear magnetic mappings while strictly preserving the linear dependence on currents. As a result, the field models enable fast, closed-form minimum-norm inversion with evaluation times of approximately 1 ms, which is critical for high-bandwidth magnetic control. For model training and evaluation we use large-scale, high-density datasets collected from the research-grade OctoMag and clinical-grade Navion systems. Our results demonstrate that data-driven models achieve predictive fidelity equivalent to the MPEM while maintaining comparable data efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate that straightforward design choices effectively eliminate spurious workspace ill-conditioning frequently reported in MPEM-based calibration. To facilitate future research, we release the complete codebase and datasets open source.

Abstract: Under the ideal assumption of uniform propagation, cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) provides uniformly high throughput over the network by effectively surrounding each user with its serving access point (AP) set. However, in realistic non-uniform urban propagation environments, it is difficult to consistently select good limited serving AP sets, resulting in significantly degraded throughput, reintroducing "edge-effect" for the worst-served users. To restore the uniformly good performance of scalable CF-mMIMO in realistic urban networks, we formulate a novel multi-objective optimization problem to jointly achieve high throughput by maximizing the sum data rate, uniform throughput by maximizing Jain's fairness index of the throughput per user, and scalability by minimizing the serving AP set size. We then propose the UnifSrv AP selection algorithms to solve this optimization problem, consisting of a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm UnifSrv-DRL and a heuristic algorithm UnifSrv-heu. We conduct a comprehensive performance evaluation of scalable CF-mMIMO under realistic urban network distributions, propagation, and mobility patterns, showing that the prior benchmark AP selection schemes fail to provide uniformly high throughput in practice. By contrast, UnifSrv at least doubles the throughput compared to prior benchmarks, or achieves comparable throughput but with half of the serving AP set size. Importantly, our heuristic algorithm achieves equivalent throughput to our DRL one, but with orders of magnitude lower complexity. We thus for the first time propose an AP selection algorithm that achieves uniformly good CF-mMIMO performance in realistic urban networks with low complexity.

Abstract: This paper presents the design and implementation of data-driven optimal derivative feedback controllers for an active magnetic levitation system. A direct, model-free control design method based on the reinforcement learning framework is compared with an indirect optimal control design derived from a numerically identified mathematical model of the system. For the direct model-free approach, a policy iteration procedure is proposed, which adds an iteration layer called the epoch loop to gather multiple sets of process data, providing a more diverse dataset and helping reduce learning biases. This direct control design method is evaluated against a comparable optimal control solution designed from a plant model obtained through the combined Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control (DMDc) and Prediction Error Minimization (PEM) system identification. Results show that while both controllers can stabilize and improve the performance of the magnetic levitation system when compared to controllers designed from a nominal model, the direct model-free approach consistently outperforms the indirect solution when multiple epochs are allowed. The iterative refinement of the optimal control law over the epoch loop provides the direct approach a clear advantage over the indirect method, which relies on a single set of system data to determine the identified model and control.

Abstract: Split learning recently emerged as a solution for distributed machine learning with heterogeneous IoT devices, where clients can offload part of their training to computationally-powerful helpers. The core challenge in split learning is to minimize the training time by jointly devising the client-helper assignment and the schedule of tasks at the helpers. We first study the model where each helper has a memory cardinality constraint on how many clients it may be assigned, which represents the case of homogeneous tasks. Through complexity theory, we rule out exact polynomial-time algorithms and approximation schemes even for highly restricted instances of this problem. We complement these negative results with a non-trivial polynomial-time 5-approximation algorithm. Building on this, we then focus on the more general heterogeneous task setting considered by Tirana et al. [INFOCOM 2024], where helpers have memory capacity constraints and clients have variable memory costs. In this case, we prove that, unless P=NP, the problem cannot admit a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for any approximation factor. However, by adapting our aforementioned 5-approximation algorithm, we develop a novel heuristic for the heterogeneous task setting and show that it outperforms heuristics from prior works through extensive experiments.

Abstract: Doppler-resilient complementary sequence (DRCS) sets play a vital role in modern communication and sensing systems, particularly in high-mobility environments. This work makes two primary contributions. First, we refine the definition of quasi-Florentine rectangles to a more general form,termed generalized quasi-Florentine rectangles, and propose a systematic method for their construction. Second, we propose several sets of aperiodic DRCS based on generalized quasi Florentine rectangles and Butson-type Hadamard matrices. The proposed aperiodic DRCS sets are shown to be asymptotically optimal with respect to the lower bound of aperiodic DRCS sets.

Abstract: Relays are pivotal in military communication networks, expanding coverage and ensuring reliable connectivity in challenging operational environments. While traditional terrestrial relays (TR) are constrained by fixed locations and vulnerability to physical obstructions, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted aerial relays (AR) offer a dynamic and flexible alternative by operating above obstacles and adapting to changing battlefield conditions. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of AR systems in military communications, presenting a detailed comparison between AR and TR paradigms and examining two specific AR technologies: active aerial relays (AAR) and aerial reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS) relays. The survey delves into their operation, benefits, challenges, and military applications, supported by a qualitative analysis across metrics such as coverage, flexibility, security, and cost. A novel multi-dimensional metric, the mission-critical relay effectiveness score (MCRES), is introduced as a quantitative method for evaluating relay suitability based on mission-specific weights for critical attributes like mobility, jamming resilience, deployment speed, stealth, coverage, and autonomy. Furthermore, we present Algorithm 1, a decision-making framework that leverages the MCRES to guide the systematic selection of the optimal relay type, AR or TR, and subsequently AAR or ARIS, tailored to the unique demands of a given military scenario, such as dynamic battlefield operations, electronic warfare, or covert missions. Finally, the paper addresses current implementation challenges and outlines promising future research directions to advance the deployment of robust and resilient UAV-mounted relay systems in contested military environments.

Abstract: The sixth-generation (6G) of wireless communication networks aims to leverage artificial intelligence tools for efficient and robust network optimization. This is especially the case since traditional optimization methods often face high computational complexity, motivating the use of deep learning (DL)-based optimization frameworks. In this context, this paper considers a multi-antenna base station (BS) serving multiple users simultaneously through transmit beamforming in downlink mode. To account for robustness, this work proposes an uncertainty-injected deep unfolded fractional programming (UI-DUFP) framework for weighted sum rate (WSR) maximization under imperfect channel conditions. The proposed method unfolds fractional programming (FP) iterations into trainable neural network layers refined by projected gradient descent (PGD) steps, while robustness is introduced by injecting sampled channel uncertainties during training and optimizing a quantile-based objective. Simulation results show that the proposed UI-DUFP achieves higher WSR and improved robustness compared to classical weighted minimum mean square error, FP, and DL baselines, while maintaining low inference time and good scalability. These findings highlight the potential of deep unfolding combined with uncertainty-aware training as a powerful approach for robust optimization in 6G networks.

Abstract: This paper develops a framework for analyzing UAV-enabled short-packet communication, leveraging fluid antenna system (FAS)-assisted relaying networks. Operating in the short-packet regime and focusing on challenging urban environments, we derive novel, closed-form expressions for the block error rate (BLER). This is achieved by modeling the spatially correlated Nakagami-$m$ fading link via a tractable eigenvalue-based approach. A high-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) asymptotic analysis is also presented, revealing the system's fundamental diversity order. Building on this analysis, we formulate a novel energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem that, unlike idealized models, uniquely incorporates the non-trivial time and energy overheads of FAS port selection. An efficient hierarchical algorithm is proposed to jointly optimize key system parameters. Numerical results validate our analysis, demonstrating that while FAS provides substantial power gains, the operational overhead creates a critical trade-off. This trade-off dictates an optimal number of FAS ports and a non-trivial optimal UAV deployment altitude, governed by the balance between blockage and path loss. This work provides key insights for FAS-aided UAV communications.

Motivation: 考虑多用户与融合中心之间的安全计算场景：每个用户拥有比特序列，通过单向公共信道与融合中心通信。融合中心需要计算所有序列的和，同时满足隐私要求：即使一组合谋用户与融合中心协作，也无法获取超过预设阈值δ的其他用户序列信息（通过互信息度量）。现有研究需要确定实现该隐私约束所需的最小通信量和用户随机性，并探究私有求和计算与秘密分享之间的理论联系。

Abstract: Consider multiple users and a fusion center. Each user possesses a sequence of bits and can communicate with the fusion center through a one-way public channel. The fusion center's task is to compute the sum of all the sequences under the privacy requirement that a set of colluding users, along with the fusion center, cannot gain more than a predetermined amount $δ$ of information, measured through mutual information, about the sequences of other users. Our first contribution is to characterize the minimum amount of necessary communication between the users and the fusion center, as well as the minimum amount of necessary randomness at the users. Our second contribution is to establish a connection between private sum computation and secret sharing by showing that secret sharing is necessary to generate the local randomness needed for private sum computation, and prove that it holds true for any $δ\geq 0$.

Motivation: 为分析集成感知与通信系统中，受AI编码器瓶颈的发射机与流体天线系统接收机协同工作时，其通信速率与感知精度之间的理论极限关系，需探究端口空间自由度与物理尺度对系统性能的制约规律。

Abstract: This paper characterizes the fundamental limits of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) when the transmitter is subject to an artificial intelligence (AI) representation bottleneck and the receiver employs a fluid antenna system (FAS). Specifically, the message is first encoded into an ideal Gaussian waveform and mapped by an AI encoder into a finite-capacity latent representation that constitutes the physical channel input, while the FAS receiver selects the port experiencing the most favorable channel conditions. We reveal that the AI bottleneck is equivalent to an additive representation noise, which reduces both the communication and sensing signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) at the selected port. We then derive the resulting ISAC capacitydistortion region and establish tight converse and achievability bounds under general fading models, including Jakes-correlated channels. Leveraging the spatial degrees of freedom (DoF) characterization of the Jakes' model, we furthermore prove that the port-selection gain is fundamentally constrained by the physical length of the FAS region: the effective diversity order equals the numerical rank of the Jakes' correlation matrix and increases only with the FAS length. Consequently, enlarging the FAS length allows the selected-port SNR to approach the AI-imposed ceiling, driving the achievable communication rate and sensing mean square error (MSE) toward their AI-limited fundamental bounds. Numerical results corroborate the analysis and scaling laws.

Abstract: Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) self-dual codes are of significant theoretical and practical importance. Generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes are the most prominent MDS codes. Correspondingly there have been many research on constructions of Euclidean self-dual MDS codes by using GRS codes. However, the study on Hermitian self-dual GRS codes is relatively limited. Since Hermitian self-dual GRS codes do not exist for $n>q+1$, this paper is devoted to an investigation of GRS codes in the case where $n\le q+1$. First, we prove that when $n\leq q+1$, there are only two classes of Hermitian self-dual GRS codes, confirming the conjecture in [13] and providing its proof simultaneously. Second, we present two explicit construction methods. Thus, the existence and construction of Hermitian self-dual GRS codes are fully solved.

Abstract: This paper investigates the joint compression problem of a vector Gaussian source, where an individual distortion constraint is imposed on each source component. It is known that the rate-distortion function (RDF) is lower-bounded by the rate derived from the Hadamard inequality, which becomes exact when the semidefinite condition (SDC) holds. However, existing works often overlook the case where the SDC is not satisfied. Moreover, even when the SDC holds, a quantitative characterization of how correlations enable more efficient compression is lacking. In this work, we refine the results when the SDC is satisfied and derive new theoretical results when the SDC is not satisfied, thereby establishing theoretical limits for practical source compression with correlations. Specifically, we examine the properties of optimal source reconstruction and provide upper bounds on its dimension, showing that lower-dimensional reconstructions are essential for efficient compression when the SDC does not hold. Within a scalable two-type correlation (2TC) covariance framework, we prove that the probability of satisfying the SDC decays exponentially with source length, emphasizing the importance of exploring theoretical limits when the SDC is not met. Additional, we determine the component-wise correlations that a vector source should possess to achieve the Hadamard compression rate, revealing the trade-off between distortion constraints and correlations. More importantly, by deriving an explicit RDF with correlations incorporated, we quantitatively characterize the gain in compression efficiency achieved by fully leveraging source correlations.

Abstract: We investigate the fundamental task of addition under uncertainty, namely, addends that are represented as intervals of numbers rather than single values. One potential source of such uncertainty can occur when obtaining discrete-valued measurements of analog values, which are prone to metastability. Naturally, unstable bits impact gate-level and, consequently, circuit-level computations. Using Binary encoding for such an addition produces a sum with an amplified imprecision. Hence, the challenge is to devise an encoding that does not amplify the imprecision caused by unstable bits. We call such codes recoverable. While this challenge is easily met for unary encoding, no suitable codes of high rates are known. In this work, we prove an upper bound on the rate of preserving and recoverable codes for a given bound on the addends' combined uncertainty. We then design an asymptotically optimal code that preserves the addends' combined uncertainty. We then discuss how to obtain adders for our code. The approach can be used with any known or future construction for containing metastability of the inputs. We conjecture that careful design based on existing techniques can lead to significant latency reduction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在FDD多天线系统中，下行CSI需要通过上行反馈来获取。传统研究通常假设完美CSI或忽略训练相位的影响。本文旨在在有限训练长度和Gaussian导频条件下，建立CSI反馈系统的理论性能极限，填补这一重要研究空白。

Method: 用户采用MMSE信道估计，然后使用渐近最优的上行反馈。作者推导了整体CSI反馈系统的通用速率失真函数(RDF)。在训练符号数超过天线维度的情况下，针对任意下行SNR提供了非渐近界和渐近缩放规律。通过数学分析证明，在充分训练时总体RDF会收敛到用户完全了解下行CSI时的直接RDF。

Result: 关键发现表明，在足够训练时，总体RDF收敛到直接RDF。更重要的是，即使在固定下行SNR下，收敛速率与训练长度成反比。仿真结果显示边界是紧的，并且发现在非常有限的训练条件下，总体RDF与直接RDF之间的偏差很大。

Conclusion: 本文为FDD多天线OFDM系统中的CSI反馈建立了基本理论极限，揭示了训练长度对反馈性能的关键影响。研究结果表明，增加训练可以有效提升反馈系统性能并减少与理想情况的性能差距，为实际系统设计提供了重要理论指导。

Abstract: This paper establishes the theoretical limits of channel state information (CSI) feedback in frequency-division duplexing (FDD) multi-antenna orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems under finite-length training with Gaussian pilots. The user employs minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) channel estimation followed by asymptotically optimal uplink feedback. Specifically, we derive a general rate-distortion function (RDF) of the overall CSI feedback system. We then provide both non-asymptotic bounds and asymptotic scaling for the RDF under arbitrary downlink signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when the number of training symbols exceeds the antenna dimension. A key observation is that, with sufficient training, the overall RDF converges to the direct RDF corresponding to the case where the user has full access to the downlink CSI. More importantly, we demonstrate that even at a fixed downlink SNR, the convergence rate is inversely proportional to the training length. The simulation results show that our bounds are tight, and under very limited training, the deviation between the overall RDF and the direct RDF is substantial.

Abstract: Near field mmWave sensing is poised to play a key role in future wireless systems, enabling environment-aware, embodied, and application adaptive operation under stringent form-factor and hardware constraints. However, achieving high spatial resolution in the near field typically requires large antenna arrays, multiple radio frequency (RF) chains, or mechanical scanning, creating a fundamental tension between spatial observability and system simplicity. This paper presents frequency as aperture clip on antenna fabric (FaACAF), a hardware efficient sensing by design architecture that synthesizes spatial aperture through the FaA paradigm using a single RF chain. FaACAF realizes a modular clip on aperture fabric, in which frequency selective clip on modules (CMs) are attached to a shared guided-wave substrate and implicitly coordinated by the instantaneous frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) excitation frequency. In this fabric, FMCW signaling simultaneously indexes the sensing aperture and orchestrates uplink/downlink signal distribution and echo multiplexing in a switch free, fully passive, and all analog manner, eliminating RF switching and multichannel front ends. An online self calibration mechanism stabilizes the frequency to aperture mapping under practical attachment variability without requiring full matrix calibration. Two case studies illustrate the robustness of the proposed approach and quantify the predictable sensing margin tradeoffs introduced by modular deployment. Overall, FaACAF demonstrates that near field spatial observability can be scaled through architectural coordination in the frequency domain rather than hardware expansion, providing a reconfigurable and hardware efficient pathway toward embodied sensing and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in future wireless systems.

Abstract: Watermarking is a technical alternative to safeguarding intellectual property and reducing misuse. Existing methods focus on optimizing watermarked latent variables to balance watermark robustness and fidelity, as Latent diffusion models (LDMs) are considered a powerful tool for generative tasks.

We develop the first analytical derivation of the time-dependent modulation coefficient that guides the diffusion of watermark residuals to achieve controllable watermark embedding pattern.Experimental results show that ALIEN-Q outperforms the state-of-the-art by 33.1\% across 5 quality metrics, and ALIEN-R demonstrates 14.0\% improved robustness against generative variant and stability threats compared to the state-of-the-art across 15 distinct conditions.

Motivation: 传统VVC中的两遍率控制依赖于分析型的码率-QP模型，这些模型难以捕捉空间-时间非线性变化，导致质量不稳定和复杂的多遍编码。需要一种更高效的替代方案来提高编码效率。

Conclusion: VCA驱动的比特预测为传统的码率-QP模型提供了一种计算高效且准确的替代方案，能够有效降低编码复杂度。

Abstract: Rate control allocates bits efficiently across frames to meet a target bitrate while maintaining quality. Conventional two-pass rate control (2pRC) in Versatile Video Coding (VVC) relies on analytical rate-QP models, which often fail to capture nonlinear spatial-temporal variations, causing quality instability and high complexity due to multiple trial encodes. This paper proposes a content-adaptive framework that predicts frame-level bit consumption using lightweight features from the Video Complexity Analyzer (VCA) and quantization parameters within a Random Forest regression. On ultra-high-definition sequences encoded with VVenC, the model achieves strong correlation with ground truth, yielding R2 values of 0.93, 0.88, and 0.77 for I-, P-, and B-frames, respectively. Integrated into a rate-control loop, it achieves comparable coding efficiency to 2pRC while reducing total encoding time by 33.3%. The results show that VCA-driven bit prediction provides a computationally efficient and accurate alternative to conventional rate-QP models.

Abstract: In this paper, we summarize the methods and results of our submission to the LUMIR25 challenge in Learn2Reg 2025, which achieved 1st place overall on the test set. Extended from LUMIR24, this year's task focuses on zero-shot registration under domain shifts (high-field MRI, pathological brains, and various MRI contrasts), while the training data comprise only in-domain T1-weighted brain MRI. We start with a meticulous analysis of LUMIR24 winners to identify the main contributors to good monomodal registration performance. To achieve good generalization with diverse contrasts from a model trained with T1-weighted MRI only, we employ three simple but effective strategies: (i) a multimodal loss based on the modality-independent neighborhood descriptor (MIND), (ii) intensity randomization for appearance augmentation, and (iii) lightweight instance-specific optimization (ISO) on feature encoders at inference time. On the validation set, our approach achieves reasonable T1-T2 registration accuracy while maintaining good deformation regularity.

Abstract: Fetal echocardiography is essential for detecting congenital heart disease (CHD), facilitating pregnancy management, optimized delivery planning, and timely postnatal interventions. Among standard imaging planes, the four-chamber (4CH) view provides comprehensive information for CHD diagnosis, where clinicians carefully inspect the end-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) phases to evaluate cardiac structure and motion. Automated detection of these cardiac phases is thus a critical component toward fully automated CHD analysis. Yet, in the absence of fetal electrocardiography (ECG), manual identification of ED and ES frames remains a labor-intensive bottleneck. We present ORBIT (Orientation-Robust Beat Inference from Trajectories), a self-supervised framework that identifies cardiac phases without manual annotations under various fetal heart orientation. ORBIT employs registration as self-supervision task and learns a latent motion trajectory of cardiac deformation, whose turning points capture transitions between cardiac relaxation and contraction, enabling accurate and orientation-robust localization of ED and ES frames across diverse fetal positions. Trained exclusively on normal fetal echocardiography videos, ORBIT achieves consistent performance on both normal (MAE = 1.9 frames for ED and 1.6 for ES) and CHD cases (MAE = 2.4 frames for ED and 2.1 for ES), outperforming existing annotation-free approaches constrained by fixed orientation assumptions. These results highlight the potential of ORBIT to facilitate robust cardiac phase detection directly from 4CH fetal echocardiography.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了Jackpot框架，通过最优预算拒绝采样（OBRS）减少rollout模型与策略模型之间的分布不匹配，实现rollout生成与策略优化的解耦，显著提升强化学习训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型的强化学习训练成本高昂，主要源于rollout过程开销大。如果能将rollout生成与策略优化解耦（例如使用更高效的模型进行rollout），可以显著提升效率，但这样做会引入严重的分布不匹配问题，导致学习不稳定。

Method: 提出Jackpot框架，包含三个核心组件：1）使用最优预算拒绝采样（OBRS）直接减少rollout模型与演化策略之间的差异；2）统一训练目标，联合更新策略和rollout模型；3）高效系统实现，通过top-k概率估计和批次级别偏差校正实现。

Result: 理论分析表明OBRS能在可控制的接受预算下使rollout分布更接近目标分布。实证结果显示，相比重要性采样基线，Jackpot显著提升了训练稳定性，在训练Qwen3-8B-Base模型（批次大小64，最多300更新步）时达到了与on-policy RL相当的性能。

Conclusion: 基于OBRS的对齐方法使我们向实现LLM强化学习中rollout生成与策略优化的实用有效解耦迈进了一步，为解决强化学习训练效率问题提供了有前景的方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for large language models (LLMs) remains expensive, particularly because the rollout is expensive. Decoupling rollout generation from policy optimization (e.g., leveraging a more efficient model to rollout) could enable substantial efficiency gains, yet doing so introduces a severe distribution mismatch that destabilizes learning. We propose Jackpot, a framework that leverages Optimal Budget Rejection Sampling (OBRS) to directly reduce the discrepancy between the rollout model and the evolving policy. Jackpot integrates a principled OBRS procedure, a unified training objective that jointly updates the policy and rollout models, and an efficient system implementation enabled by top-$k$ probability estimation and batch-level bias correction. Our theoretical analysis shows that OBRS consistently moves the rollout distribution closer to the target distribution under a controllable acceptance budget. Empirically, \sys substantially improves training stability compared to importance-sampling baselines, achieving performance comparable to on-policy RL when training Qwen3-8B-Base for up to 300 update steps of batchsize 64. Taken together, our results show that OBRS-based alignment brings us a step closer to practical and effective decoupling of rollout generation from policy optimization for RL for LLMs.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable reasoning capabilities, achieving impressive results across a wide range of tasks. Despite these advances, significant reasoning failures persist, occurring even in seemingly simple scenarios. To systematically understand and address these shortcomings, we present the first comprehensive survey dedicated to reasoning failures in LLMs. We introduce a novel categorization framework that distinguishes reasoning into embodied and non-embodied types, with the latter further subdivided into informal (intuitive) and formal (logical) reasoning. In parallel, we classify reasoning failures along a complementary axis into three types: fundamental failures intrinsic to LLM architectures that broadly affect downstream tasks; application-specific limitations that manifest in particular domains; and robustness issues characterized by inconsistent performance across minor variations. For each reasoning failure, we provide a clear definition, analyze existing studies, explore root causes, and present mitigation strategies. By unifying fragmented research efforts, our survey provides a structured perspective on systemic weaknesses in LLM reasoning, offering valuable insights and guiding future research towards building stronger, more reliable, and robust reasoning capabilities. We additionally release a comprehensive collection of research works on LLM reasoning failures, as a GitHub repository at https://github.com/Peiyang-Song/Awesome-LLM-Reasoning-Failures, to provide an easy entry point to this area.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework for the logical specification of non-Markovian rewards in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with large state spaces. Our approach leverages Linear Temporal Logic Modulo Theories over finite traces (LTLfMT), a more expressive extension of classical temporal logic in which predicates are first-order formulas of arbitrary first-order theories rather than simple Boolean variables. This enhanced expressiveness enables the specification of complex tasks over unstructured and heterogeneous data domains, promoting a unified and reusable framework that eliminates the need for manual predicate encoding. However, the increased expressive power of LTLfMT introduces additional theoretical and computational challenges compared to standard LTLf specifications. We address these challenges from a theoretical standpoint, identifying a fragment of LTLfMT that is tractable but sufficiently expressive for reward specification in an infinite-state-space context. From a practical perspective, we introduce a method based on reward machines and Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) to translate first-order logic specifications and address reward sparsity. We evaluate this approach to a continuous-control setting using Non-Linear Arithmetic Theory, showing that it enables natural specification of complex tasks. Experimental results show how a tailored implementation of HER is fundamental in solving tasks with complex goals.

TL;DR: GrAlgoBench 提出一個圖演算法基准來評估大型推理模型，發現現有模型在長上下文推理中存在準確率下降和過度思考兩大弱點。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 現有數學、程式碼和常識推理基准存在限制：缺乏長上下文評估、挑戰性不足、難以程式化驗證答案。需要一個更全面的推理能力評估標準。

Method: 使用圖演算法問題建構測驗基準，包括九個任務，可控制難度、支援長上下文推理、並實現標準化的程式化評估。對現有大型推理模型進行系統實驗。

Result: 發現兩個主要弱點：1) 上下文長度增加時準確率急劇下降（圖節點超過120個時低於50%），原因是執行錯誤、記憶力弱、冗餘推理；2) 過度思考現象，大量自我驗證未能提高正確性，反而增加推理軌跡。

Conclusion: 圖演算法問題能作為一個嚴謹的多維度測試平台，GrAlgoBench 揭示了現有大型推理模型的關鍵局限性，有助於推進推理能力研究。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have advanced rapidly; however, existing benchmarks in mathematics, code, and common-sense reasoning remain limited. They lack long-context evaluation, offer insufficient challenge, and provide answers that are difficult to verify programmatically. We introduce GrAlgoBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LRMs through graph algorithm problems. Such problems are particularly well suited for probing reasoning abilities: they demand long-context reasoning, allow fine-grained control of difficulty levels, and enable standardized, programmatic evaluation. Across nine tasks, our systematic experiments reveal two major weaknesses of current LRMs. First, accuracy deteriorates sharply as context length increases, falling below 50% once graphs exceed 120 nodes. This degradation is driven by frequent execution errors, weak memory, and redundant reasoning. Second, LRMs suffer from an over-thinking phenomenon, primarily caused by extensive yet largely ineffective self-verification, which inflates reasoning traces without improving correctness. By exposing these limitations, GrAlgoBench establishes graph algorithm problems as a rigorous, multidimensional, and practically relevant testbed for advancing the study of reasoning in LRMs. Code is available at https://github.com/Bklight999/GrAlgoBench.

Abstract: GUI grounding maps natural language instructions to the correct interface elements, serving as the perception foundation for GUI agents. Existing approaches predominantly rely on fine-tuning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) using large-scale GUI datasets to predict target element coordinates, which is data-intensive and generalizes poorly to unseen interfaces. Recent attention-based alternatives exploit localization signals in MLLMs attention mechanisms without task-specific fine-tuning, but suffer from low reliability due to the lack of explicit and complementary spatial anchors in GUI images. To address this limitation, we propose Trifuse, an attention-based grounding framework that explicitly integrates complementary spatial anchors. Trifuse integrates attention, OCR-derived textual cues, and icon-level caption semantics via a Consensus-SinglePeak (CS) fusion strategy that enforces cross-modal agreement while retaining sharp localization peaks. Extensive evaluations on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that Trifuse achieves strong performance without task-specific fine-tuning, substantially reducing the reliance on expensive annotated data. Moreover, ablation studies reveal that incorporating OCR and caption cues consistently improves attention-based grounding performance across different backbones, highlighting its effectiveness as a general framework for GUI grounding.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), exemplified by DeepSeek-R1, have underscored the potential of scaling inference-time compute through Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). However, GRPO frequently suffers from gradient signal attenuation when encountering problems that are either too trivial or overly complex. In these scenarios, the disappearance of inter-group advantages makes the gradient signal susceptible to noise, thereby jeopardizing convergence stability. While variants like DAPO attempt to rectify gradient vanishing, they do not alleviate the substantial computational overhead incurred by exhaustive rollouts on low-utility samples. In this paper, we propose Difficulty-Estimated Policy Optimization (DEPO), a novel framework designed to optimize the efficiency and robustness of reasoning alignment. DEPO integrates an online Difficulty Estimator that dynamically assesses and filters training data before the rollout phase. This mechanism ensures that computational resources are prioritized for samples with high learning potential. Empirical results demonstrate that DEPO achieves up to a 2x reduction in rollout costs without compromising model performance. Our approach significantly lowers the computational barrier for training high-performance reasoning models, offering a more sustainable path for reasoning scaling. Code and data will be released upon acceptance.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了QA-Token，一种能够直接整合数据可靠性到词汇构建过程中的质量感知分词方法，通过双层优化、强化学习策略和自适应参数学习机制，在各种真实世界噪声数据上实现了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的分词方法在处理序列数据时未考虑信号质量因素，限制了其在噪声较大的真实世界语料库上的有效性。现实数据如基因组序列和金融时间序列通常存在质量问题，需要更智能的分词策略。

Method: 1) 提出双层优化框架联合优化词汇构建与下游任务性能；2) 设计强化学习方法，利用质量感知奖励学习合并策略并保证收敛性；3) 采用Gumbel-Softmax松弛机制实现自适应参数学习的端到端优化。

Result: 实验结果显示显著改进：基因组学上变异检测F1值提升6.7个百分点；金融领域夏普比率提升30%；在大规模预训练语料上，病理检测达到94.53的MCC值，同时token数量减少15%。

Conclusion: QA-Token方法为处理真实世界噪声语料提供了有效解决方案，能够处理大尺度的基因组序列和金融时间序列数据，且该方法在推理时不产生额外开销，为训练基础模型开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Current tokenization methods process sequential data without accounting for signal quality, limiting their effectiveness on noisy real-world corpora. We present QA-Token (Quality-Aware Tokenization), which incorporates data reliability directly into vocabulary construction. We make three key contributions: (i) a bilevel optimization formulation that jointly optimizes vocabulary construction and downstream performance, (ii) a reinforcement learning approach that learns merge policies through quality-aware rewards with convergence guarantees, and (iii) an adaptive parameter learning mechanism via Gumbel-Softmax relaxation for end-to-end optimization. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates consistent improvements: genomics (6.7 percentage point F1 gain in variant calling over BPE), finance (30% Sharpe ratio improvement). At foundation scale, we tokenize a pretraining corpus comprising 1.7 trillion base-pairs and achieve state-of-the-art pathogen detection (94.53 MCC) while reducing token count by 15%. We unlock noisy real-world corpora, spanning petabases of genomic sequences and terabytes of financial time series, for foundation model training with zero inference overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点将LLMs在长序列任务中的性能下降归因于任务复杂度，但论文主张这并不完整，即使在线性、无分支任务中，自回归生成也存在内在稳定性限制。论文旨在将长序列推理重构为结构治理问题，揭示自回归架构在维持长期连贯性方面的根本约束。

Method: 提出理论定理A，证明单路径自回归推理中的决策优势随执行长度呈指数衰减，从而对可维持的推理链施加根本性限制。在合成环境和真实TextWorld任务中进行实证研究，观测性能陡降现象。

Result: 实验结果显示，性能陡降与理论预测一致，证实了自回归推理的过程级不稳定性。短序列评估协议可能掩盖结构不稳定性。

Conclusion: 研究从动力学视角解释了长序列推理失败的原因，揭示了纯自回归架构在维持长期连贯性方面的局限性。未来推理系统可能需要从单纯扩展转向结构化治理，以支持稳定长序列推理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities, yet their performance often deteriorates sharply in long-horizon tasks, exhibiting systematic breakdown beyond certain scales. Conventional explanations primarily attribute this phenomenon to task complexity, such as combinatorial search explosion or long-term credit assignment challenges. In this work, we argue that these explanations are incomplete: even in linear, unbranched tasks without semantic ambiguity, autoregressive execution is subject to an intrinsic stability limit.
  We propose that the fundamental constraint on long-horizon reasoning arises from process-level instability in autoregressive generation rather than solely from search or task complexity, reframing long-horizon reasoning as a problem of structural governance. We derive Theorem~A, showing that decision advantage in single-path autoregressive reasoning decays exponentially with execution length, imposing a fundamental bound on maintainable reasoning chains. This result implies a structural consequence: stable long-horizon reasoning requires discrete segmentation, naturally inducing graph-like execution structures such as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).
  Empirical studies in both synthetic environments and real TextWorld tasks reveal observable performance cliffs consistent with theoretical predictions. Our findings provide a dynamical perspective on long-horizon reasoning failure and suggest new limitations on maintaining long-term coherence under purely autoregressive architectures. Furthermore, we highlight that short-horizon evaluation protocols may obscure structural instability, indicating a potential shift from scaling toward structured governance in future reasoning systems.

Motivation: 现有智能体系统过度依赖大规模语言模型，边缘规模模型的潜力未得到充分探索，需要系统研究如何提升小参数规模模型的推理稳定性。

Method: 提出包含参数空间模型融合、奖励信号去噪和上下文信息精炼的整体训练框架，开发了具备高知识密度和强探索能力的AgentCPM-Explore模型。

Result: 在4B级模型中取得SOTA性能，匹配或超越8B级SOTA模型，在五个基准测试中超过Claude-4.5-Sonnet和DeepSeek-v3.2，在GAIA文本任务中达到97.09%准确率(pass@64)。

Conclusion: 边缘规模模型的关键瓶颈是推理稳定性而不是内在能力上限，通过本文的训练框架可以有效释放这些模型被低估的潜力。

Abstract: While Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown remarkable potential for solving complex tasks, existing systems remain heavily reliant on large-scale models, leaving the capabilities of edge-scale models largely underexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic study on training agentic models at the 4B-parameter scale. We identify three primary bottlenecks hindering the performance of edge-scale models: catastrophic forgetting during Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), sensitivity to reward signal noise during Reinforcement Learning (RL), and reasoning degradation caused by redundant information in long-context scenarios. To address the issues, we propose AgentCPM-Explore, a compact 4B agent model with high knowledge density and strong exploration capability. We introduce a holistic training framework featuring parameter-space model fusion, reward signal denoising, and contextual information refinement. Through deep exploration, AgentCPM-Explore achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among 4B-class models, matches or surpasses 8B-class SOTA models on four benchmarks, and even outperforms larger-scale models such as Claude-4.5-Sonnet or DeepSeek-v3.2 in five benchmarks. Notably, AgentCPM-Explore achieves 97.09% accuracy on GAIA text-based tasks under pass@64. These results provide compelling evidence that the bottleneck for edge-scale models is not their inherent capability ceiling, but rather their inference stability. Based on our well-established training framework, AgentCPM-Explore effectively unlocks the significant, yet previously underestimated, potential of edge-scale models.

Abstract: Evaluating agentic AI on open-ended professional tasks faces a fundamental dilemma between rigor and flexibility. Static rubrics provide rigorous, reproducible assessment but fail to accommodate diverse valid response strategies, while LLM-as-a-judge approaches adapt to individual responses yet suffer from instability and bias. Human experts address this dilemma by combining domain-grounded principles with dynamic, claim-level assessment. Inspired by this process, we propose JADE, a two-layer evaluation framework. Layer 1 encodes expert knowledge as a predefined set of evaluation skills, providing stable evaluation criteria. Layer 2 performs report-specific, claim-level evaluation to flexibly assess diverse reasoning strategies, with evidence-dependency gating to invalidate conclusions built on refuted claims. Experiments on BizBench show that JADE improves evaluation stability and reveals critical agent failure modes missed by holistic LLM-based evaluators. We further demonstrate strong alignment with expert-authored rubrics and effective transfer to a medical-domain benchmark, validating JADE across professional domains.

Abstract: Scaling test-time compute with multi-path chain-of-thought improves reasoning accuracy, but its effectiveness depends critically on the exploration-exploitation trade-off. Existing approaches address this trade-off in rigid ways: tree-structured search hard-codes exploration through brittle expansion rules that interfere with post-trained reasoning, while parallel reasoning over-explores redundant hypothesis paths and relies on weak answer selection. Motivated by the observation that the optimal balance is phase-dependent and that correct and incorrect reasoning paths often diverge only at late stages, we reformulate test-time scaling as a dynamic expand-reduce control problem over a pool of hypotheses. We propose HyPER, a training-free online control policy for multi-path decoding in mixture-of-experts models that reallocates computation under a fixed budget using lightweight path statistics. HyPER consists of an online controller that transitions from exploration to exploitation as the hypothesis pool evolves, a token-level refinement mechanism that enables efficient generation-time exploitation without full-path resampling, and a length- and confidence-aware aggregation strategy for reliable answer-time exploitation. Experiments on four mixture-of-experts language models across diverse reasoning benchmarks show that HyPER consistently achieves a superior accuracy-compute trade-off, improving accuracy by 8 to 10 percent while reducing token usage by 25 to 40 percent.

Abstract: Generating deep research reports requires large-scale information acquisition and the synthesis of insight-driven analysis, posing a significant challenge for current language models. Most existing approaches follow a plan-then-write paradigm, whose performance heavily depends on the quality of the initial outline. However, constructing a comprehensive outline itself demands strong reasoning ability, causing current deep research systems to rely almost exclusively on closed-source or online large models. This reliance raises practical barriers to deployment and introduces safety and privacy concerns for user-authored data. In this work, we present AgentCPM-Report, a lightweight yet high-performing local solution composed of a framework that mirrors the human writing process and an 8B-parameter deep research agent. Our framework uses a Writing As Reasoning Policy (WARP), which enables models to dynamically revise outlines during report generation. Under this policy, the agent alternates between Evidence-Based Drafting and Reasoning-Driven Deepening, jointly supporting information acquisition, knowledge refinement, and iterative outline evolution. To effectively equip small models with this capability, we introduce a Multi-Stage Agentic Training strategy, consisting of cold-start, atomic skill RL, and holistic pipeline RL. Experiments on DeepResearch Bench, DeepConsult, and DeepResearch Gym demonstrate that AgentCPM-Report outperforms leading closed-source systems, with substantial gains in Insight.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as the predominant paradigm for training large language model (LLM)-based AI agents. However, existing backbone RL algorithms lack verified convergence guarantees in agentic scenarios, especially in multi-turn settings, which can lead to training instability and failure to converge to optimal policies.
  In this paper, we systematically analyze how different combinations of policy update mechanisms and advantage estimation methods affect convergence properties in single/multi-turn scenarios. We find that REINFORCE with Group Relative Advantage Estimation (GRAE) can converge to the globally optimal under undiscounted conditions, but the combination of PPO & GRAE breaks PPO's original monotonic improvement property. Furthermore, we demonstrate that mainstream backbone RL algorithms cannot simultaneously achieve both critic-free and convergence guarantees in multi-turn scenarios.
  To address this, we propose SeeUPO (Sequence-level Sequential Update Policy Optimization), a critic-free approach with convergence guarantees for multi-turn interactions. SeeUPO models multi-turn interaction as sequentially executed multi-agent bandit problems. Through turn-by-turn sequential policy updates in reverse execution order, it ensures monotonic improvement and convergence to global optimal solution via backward induction.
  Experiments on AppWorld and BFCL v4 demonstrate SeeUPO's substantial improvements over existing backbone algorithms: relative gains of 43.3%-54.6% on Qwen3-14B and 24.1%-41.9% on Qwen2.5-14B (averaged across benchmarks), along with superior training stability.

Abstract: The robustness of Vision Language Models (VLMs) is commonly assessed through output-level invariance, implicitly assuming that stable predictions reflect stable multimodal processing. In this work, we argue that this assumption is insufficient. We introduce a representation-aware and frequency-aware evaluation framework that measures internal embedding drift, spectral sensitivity, and structural smoothness (spatial consistency of vision tokens), alongside standard label-based metrics. Applying this framework to modern VLMs across the SEEDBench, MMMU, and POPE datasets reveals three distinct failure modes. First, models frequently preserve predicted answers while undergoing substantial internal representation drift; for perturbations such as text overlays, this drift approaches the magnitude of inter-image variability, indicating that representations move to regions typically occupied by unrelated inputs despite unchanged outputs. Second, robustness does not improve with scale; larger models achieve higher accuracy but exhibit equal or greater sensitivity, consistent with sharper yet more fragile decision boundaries. Third, we find that perturbations affect tasks differently: they harm reasoning when they disrupt how models combine coarse and fine visual cues, but on the hallucination benchmarks, they can reduce false positives by making models generate more conservative answers.

Abstract: Knowledge Graph (KG) generation requires models to learn complex semantic dependencies between triples while maintaining domain validity constraints. Unlike link prediction, which scores triples independently, generative models must capture interdependencies across entire subgraphs to produce semantically coherent structures. We present ARK (Auto-Regressive Knowledge Graph Generation), a family of autoregressive models that generate KGs by treating graphs as sequences of (head, relation, tail) triples. ARK learns implicit semantic constraints directly from data, including type consistency, temporal validity, and relational patterns, without explicit rule supervision. On the IntelliGraphs benchmark, our models achieve 89.2% to 100.0% semantic validity across diverse datasets while generating novel graphs not seen during training. We also introduce SAIL, a variational extension of ARK that enables controlled generation through learned latent representations, supporting both unconditional sampling and conditional completion from partial graphs. Our analysis reveals that model capacity (hidden dimensionality >= 64) is more critical than architectural depth for KG generation, with recurrent architectures achieving comparable validity to transformer-based alternatives while offering substantial computational efficiency. These results demonstrate that autoregressive models provide an effective framework for KG generation, with practical applications in knowledge base completion and query answering.

Abstract: We study multi-task reinforcement learning (RL), a setting in which an agent learns a single, universal policy capable of generalising to arbitrary, possibly unseen tasks. We consider tasks specified as linear temporal logic (LTL) formulae, which are commonly used in formal methods to specify properties of systems, and have recently been successfully adopted in RL. In this setting, we present a novel task embedding technique leveraging a new generation of semantic LTL-to-automata translations, originally developed for temporal synthesis. The resulting semantically labelled automata contain rich, structured information in each state that allow us to (i) compute the automaton efficiently on-the-fly, (ii) extract expressive task embeddings used to condition the policy, and (iii) naturally support full LTL. Experimental results in a variety of domains demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance and is able to scale to complex specifications where existing methods fail.

Motivation: 探索人类主动概念学习中信息获取与推理稳定性之间的权衡，特别是在神经符号贝叶斯学习框架下，理解为何人类倾向于正例测试策略（确认偏误）而非理论最优的信息最大化策略

Method: 使用神经符号贝叶斯学习方法：假设空间由大语言模型生成的程序构成，通过贝叶斯更新加权。比较两种查询策略：1) 理性主动学习——最大化近似期望信息增益；2) 正例测试策略——查询当前最佳假设预测为正的实例。在Number Game概念学习任务中评估

Result: 在需要证伪的复杂概念任务中，期望信息增益策略有效；但在简单概念任务中表现不佳。分析表明失败源于支持分布失配：高诊断性边界查询驱使后验分布进入LLM生成器难以生成有效或过于具体程序的区域。正例测试策略虽信息次优但能维持提案有效性，在简单规则上收敛更快

Conclusion: 人类的'确认偏误'可能不是认知错误，而是在人类思维典型稀疏、开放式假设空间中，为维持推理可处理性的理性适应策略

Abstract: Human concept learning is typically active: learners choose which instances to query or test in order to reduce uncertainty about an underlying rule or category. Active concept learning must balance informativeness of queries against the stability of the learner that generates and scores hypotheses. We study this trade-off in a neuro-symbolic Bayesian learner whose hypotheses are executable programs proposed by a large language model (LLM) and reweighted by Bayesian updating. We compare a Rational Active Learner that selects queries to maximize approximate expected information gain (EIG) and the human-like Positive Test Strategy (PTS) that queries instances predicted to be positive under the current best hypothesis. Across concept-learning tasks in the classic Number Game, EIG is effective when falsification is necessary (e.g., compound or exception-laden rules), but underperforms on simple concepts. We trace this failure to a support mismatch between the EIG policy and the LLM proposal distribution: highly diagnostic boundary queries drive the posterior toward regions where the generator produces invalid or overly specific programs, yielding a support-mismatch trap in the particle approximation. PTS is information-suboptimal but tends to maintain proposal validity by selecting "safe" queries, leading to faster convergence on simple rules. Our results suggest that "confirmation bias" may not be a cognitive error, but rather a rational adaptation for maintaining tractable inference in the sparse, open-ended hypothesis spaces characteristic of human thought.

Abstract: Training generalist agents capable of adapting to diverse scenarios requires interactive environments for self-exploration. However, interactive environments remain critically scarce, and existing synthesis methods suffer from significant limitations regarding environmental diversity and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce ScaleEnv, a framework that constructs fully interactive environments and verifiable tasks entirely from scratch. Specifically, ScaleEnv ensures environment reliability through procedural testing, and guarantees task completeness and solvability via tool dependency graph expansion and executable action verification. By enabling agents to learn through exploration within ScaleEnv, we demonstrate significant performance improvements on unseen, multi-turn tool-use benchmarks such as $τ^2$-Bench and VitaBench, highlighting strong generalization capabilities. Furthermore, we investigate the relationship between increasing number of domains and model generalization performance, providing empirical evidence that scaling environmental diversity is critical for robust agent learning.

Motivation: 现有结构剪枝方法在推理时采用固定剪枝决策，忽略了自回归令牌生成中出现的稀疏模式，无法充分利用上下文信息

Method: 将模型通道分为保留、候选和剪枝三个区域：预填充阶段定义粗粒度剪枝分区，解码阶段在候选区域内生成细粒度掩码，避免全通道重新评估

Result: 在多种大型基础模型（LLMs、MoEs、VLMs）上的评估表明，POP比现有剪枝方法精度更高、计算开销更小、推理延迟更低

Conclusion: POP是一种轻量级即插即用的在线结构剪枝框架，能够实现上下文条件的动态剪枝，有效平衡模型精度与计算效率

Abstract: Large foundation models (LFMs) achieve strong performance through scaling, yet current structural pruning methods derive fixed pruning decisions during inference, overlooking sparsity patterns that emerge in the autoregressive token generation. In this paper, we propose POP (Partition-guided Online Pruning), an efficient online structural pruning framework that enables context-conditioned dynamic pruning with minimal computational overhead. POP partitions model channels into retained, candidate, and pruned regions, where prefilling defines a coarse pruning partition, and the decoding stage generates a fine-grained mask within the candidate region, avoiding full-channel re-evaluation. The coarse pruning partition preserves consistently important weights, while the fine-grained masking provides context-conditioned variation during decoding. Moreover, POP is a lightweight, plug-and-play method that requires no preprocessing, including offline calibration, retraining, or learning predictors. Extensive evaluations across diverse LFMs, including large language models (LLMs), mixture-of-experts models (MoEs), and vision-language models (VLMs), demonstrate that POP consistently delivers higher accuracy than existing pruning approaches while incurring smaller computational overhead and minimizing inference latency.

Abstract: We develop a game-theoretic framework for predicting and steering the behavior of populations of large language models (LLMs) through Nash equilibrium (NE) analysis. To avoid the intractability of equilibrium computation in open-ended text spaces, we model each agent's action as a mixture over human subpopulations. Agents choose actively and strategically which groups to align with, yielding an interpretable and behaviorally substantive policy class. We derive closed-form NE characterizations, adopting standard concave-utility assumptions to enable analytical system-level predictions and give explicit, actionable guidance for shifting alignment targets toward socially desirable outcomes. The method functions as an active alignment layer on top of existing alignment pipelines such as RLHF. In a social-media setting, we show that a population of LLMs, especially reasoning-based models, may exhibit political exclusion, pathologies where some subpopulations are ignored by all LLM agents, which can be avoided by our method, illustrating the promise of applying the method to regulate multi-agent LLM dynamics across domains.

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, in practical deployments, device heterogeneity, non-independent, and identically distributed (Non-IID) data often lead to highly unstable and biased gradient updates. When differential privacy is enforced, conventional fixed gradient clipping and Gaussian noise injection may further amplify gradient perturbations, resulting in training oscillation and performance degradation and degraded model performance. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive differentially private federated learning framework that explicitly targets model efficiency under heterogeneous and privacy-constrained settings. On the client side, a lightweight local compressed module is introduced to regularize intermediate representations and constrain gradient variability, thereby mitigating noise amplification during local optimization. On the server side, an adaptive gradient clipping strategy dynamically adjusts clipping thresholds based on historical update statistics to avoid over-clipping and noise domination. Furthermore, a constraint-aware aggregation mechanism is designed to suppress unreliable or noise-dominated client updates and stabilize global optimization. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and SVHN demonstrate improved convergence stability and classification accuracy.

Abstract: LLM agents hold significant promise for advancing scientific research. To accelerate this progress, we introduce AIRS-Bench (the AI Research Science Benchmark), a suite of 20 tasks sourced from state-of-the-art machine learning papers. These tasks span diverse domains, including language modeling, mathematics, bioinformatics, and time series forecasting. AIRS-Bench tasks assess agentic capabilities over the full research lifecycle -- including idea generation, experiment analysis and iterative refinement -- without providing baseline code. The AIRS-Bench task format is versatile, enabling easy integration of new tasks and rigorous comparison across different agentic frameworks. We establish baselines using frontier models paired with both sequential and parallel scaffolds. Our results show that agents exceed human SOTA in four tasks but fail to match it in sixteen others. Even when agents surpass human benchmarks, they do not reach the theoretical performance ceiling for the underlying tasks. These findings indicate that AIRS-Bench is far from saturated and offers substantial room for improvement. We open-source the AIRS-Bench task definitions and evaluation code to catalyze further development in autonomous scientific research.

Abstract: The lightweight semi-supervised learning (LSL) strategy provides an effective approach of conserving labeled samples and minimizing model inference costs. Prior research has effectively applied knowledge transfer learning and co-training regularization from large to small models in LSL. However, such training strategies are computationally intensive and prone to local optima, thereby increasing the difficulty of finding the optimal solution. This has prompted us to investigate the feasibility of integrating three low-cost scenarios for text mining tasks: limited labeled supervision, lightweight fine-tuning, and rapid-inference small models. We propose NanoNet, a novel framework for lightweight text mining that implements parameter-efficient learning with limited supervision. It employs online knowledge distillation to generate multiple small models and enhances their performance through mutual learning regularization. The entire process leverages parameter-efficient learning, reducing training costs and minimizing supervision requirements, ultimately yielding a lightweight model for downstream inference.

Abstract: Modern large language models (LLMs) are powerful generators driven by statistical next-token prediction. While effective at producing fluent text, this design biases models toward high-probability continuations rather than exhaustive and faithful answers grounded in source content. As a result, directly applying LLMs lacks systematic mechanisms to ensure both completeness (avoiding omissions) and faithfulness (avoiding unsupported content), which fundamentally conflicts with core AI safety principles. To address this limitation, we present EVE, a structured framework for document-grounded reasoning.
  Unlike free-form prompting, EVE constrains generation to a structured, verifiable pipeline that decomposes high-rigor reasoning into extraction, validation, and enumeration. Empirically, this design enables consistent and simultaneous improvements in recall, precision, and F1-score: recall and precision increase by up to 24\% and 29\%, respectively, with a corresponding 31\% gain in F1-score. This effectively breaks the long-standing trade-off between coverage and accuracy typical of single-pass LLM generation, while also mitigating generation truncation caused by length limitations. At the same time, we emphasize that EVE exhibits performance saturation due to the inherent ambiguity of natural language, reflecting fundamental limits of language-based reasoning.

Abstract: Many engineering and scientific workflows depend on expensive black-box evaluations, requiring decision-making that simultaneously improves performance and reduces uncertainty. Bayesian optimization (BO) and Bayesian experimental design (BED) offer powerful yet largely separate treatments of goal-seeking and information-seeking, providing limited guidance for hybrid settings where learning and optimization are intrinsically coupled. We propose "pragmatic curiosity," a hybrid learning-optimization paradigm derived from active inference, in which actions are selected by minimizing the expected free energy--a single objective that couples pragmatic utility with epistemic information gain. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness and flexibility of pragmatic curiosity on various real-world hybrid tasks, including constrained system identification, targeted active search, and composite optimization with unknown preferences. Across these benchmarks, pragmatic curiosity consistently outperforms strong BO-type and BED-type baselines, delivering higher estimation accuracy, better critical-region coverage, and improved final solution quality.

Abstract: The high computational demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) motivate methods that reduce parameter count and accelerate inference. In response, model pruning emerges as an effective strategy, yet current methods typically focus on a single dimension-depth or width. We introduce MoP (Mixture of Pruners), an iterative framework that unifies these dimensions. At each iteration, MoP generates two branches-pruning in depth versus pruning in width-and selects a candidate to advance the path. On LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3, MoP advances the frontier of structured pruning, exceeding the accuracy of competing methods across a broad set of compression regimes. It also consistently outperforms depth-only and width-only pruning. Furthermore, MoP translates structural pruning into real speedup, reducing end-to-end latency by 39% at 40% compression. Finally, extending MoP to the vision-language model LLaVA-1.5, we notably improve computational efficiency and demonstrate that text-only recovery fine-tuning can restore performance even on visual tasks.

TL;DR: SWIRL是一种从无标注状态序列中学习世界模型的自我改进框架，通过将动作作为潜在变量，交替进行前向世界建模和逆向动力学建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的世界模型学习通常需要昂贵的动作标注轨迹，限制了模型学习效率和应用范围。SWIRL旨在仅从状态序列中学习，避免对动作标注的依赖。

Method: SWIRL框架将动作视为潜在变量，交替进行两个阶段：1）变分信息最大化，更新前向世界模型以最大化条件互信息；2）ELBO最大化，更新逆向动力学模型。两个模型都使用强化学习（GRPO）训练，以对方模型的log概率作为奖励信号。

Result: 在多个环境测试中表现优异：在AURORABench上提升16%，ByteMorph上提升28%，WorldPredictionBench上提升16%，StableToolBench上提升14%。涵盖了单轮和多轮开放世界视觉动态环境以及合成文本环境。

Conclusion: SWIRL能够有效从无动作标注的状态序列中学习世界模型，为LLMs和VLMs的推理和规划能力提供重要支持，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Internal modelling of the world -- predicting transitions between previous states $X$ and next states $Y$ under actions $Z$ -- is essential to reasoning and planning for LLMs and VLMs. Learning such models typically requires costly action-labelled trajectories. We propose SWIRL, a self-improvement framework that learns from state-only sequences by treating actions as a latent variable and alternating between Forward World Modelling (FWM) $P_θ(Y|X,Z)$ and an Inverse Dynamics Modelling (IDM) $Q_φ(Z|X,Y)$. SWIRL iterates two phases: (1) Variational Information Maximisation, which updates the FWM to generate next states that maximise conditional mutual information with latent actions given prior states, encouraging identifiable consistency; and (2) ELBO Maximisation, which updates the IDM to explain observed transitions, effectively performing coordinate ascent. Both models are trained with reinforcement learning (specifically, GRPO) with the opposite frozen model's log-probability as a reward signal. We provide theoretical learnability guarantees for both updates, and evaluate SWIRL on LLMs and VLMs across multiple environments: single-turn and multi-turn open-world visual dynamics and synthetic textual environments for physics, web, and tool calling. SWIRL achieves gains of 16% on AURORABench, 28% on ByteMorph, 16% on WorldPredictionBench, and 14% on StableToolBench.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a compelling remedy for machine learning (ML) models that degrade under domain shifts, improving generalisation on-the-fly with only unlabelled samples. This flexibility suits real deployments, yet conventional evaluations unrealistically assume unbounded processing time, overlooking the accuracy-latency trade-off. As ML increasingly underpins latency-sensitive and user-facing use-cases, temporal pressure constrains the viability of adaptable inference; predictions arriving too late to act on are futile. We introduce Tempora, a framework for evaluating TTA under this pressure. It consists of temporal scenarios that model deployment constraints, evaluation protocols that operationalise measurement, and time-contingent utility metrics that quantify the accuracy-latency trade-off. We instantiate the framework with three such metrics: (1) discrete utility for asynchronous streams with hard deadlines, (2) continuous utility for interactive settings where value decays with latency, and (3) amortised utility for budget-constrained deployments. Applying Tempora to seven TTA methods on ImageNet-C across 240 temporal evaluations reveals rank instability: conventional rankings do not predict rankings under temporal pressure; ETA, a state-of-the-art method in the conventional setting, falls short in 41.2% of evaluations. The highest-utility method varies with corruption type and temporal pressure, with no clear winner. By enabling systematic evaluation across diverse temporal constraints for the first time, Tempora reveals when and why rankings invert, offering practitioners a lens for method selection and researchers a target for deployable adaptation.

Abstract: Generative policies based on diffusion models and flow matching have shown strong promise for offline reinforcement learning (RL), but their applicability remains largely confined to continuous action spaces. To address a broader range of offline RL settings, we extend flow matching to a general framework that supports discrete action spaces with multiple objectives. Specifically, we replace continuous flows with continuous-time Markov chains, trained using a Q-weighted flow matching objective. We then extend our design to multi-agent settings, mitigating the exponential growth of joint action spaces via a factorized conditional path. We theoretically show that, under idealized conditions, optimizing this objective recovers the optimal policy. Extensive experiments further demonstrate that our method performs robustly in practical scenarios, including high-dimensional control, multi-modal decision-making, and dynamically changing preferences over multiple objectives. Our discrete framework can also be applied to continuous-control problems through action quantization, providing a flexible trade-off between representational complexity and performance.

Motivation: Q学习在线性函数近似下的稳定性已有研究，但解的唯一性以及在标准表格或线性MDP之外收敛的充分条件仍不清楚。本文旨在分析这些未解决问题，揭示收敛所需的额外结构，并提供反例来说明常见假设的局限性。

Method: 通过构造一维反例和理想基函数场景，展示了在贪婪策略和探索策略下，投影贝尔曼方程（PBE）可能存在多个解，进而分析算法在不适宜训练策略下的不稳定性。

Result: 研究显示，即使基函数能够完美表示真实Q函数（理想基），在贪婪策略下PBE仍可能存在多个解；在缺乏足够结构的情况下，算法在非主动探索策略下会不稳定，无法保证收敛。

Conclusion: 本文指出保证Q学习在线性近似下稳定收敛需要更强的结构条件，而不仅仅是理想基或温和探索策略；反例揭示了现有理论假设的局限性，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: In recent work it is shown that Q-learning with linear function approximation is stable, in the sense of bounded parameter estimates, under the $(\varepsilon,κ)$-tamed Gibbs policy; $κ$ is inverse temperature, and $\varepsilon>0$ is introduced for additional exploration. Under these assumptions it also follows that there is a solution to the projected Bellman equation (PBE). Left open is uniqueness of the solution, and criteria for convergence outside of the standard tabular or linear MDP settings.
  The present work extends these results to other variants of Q-learning, and clarifies prior work: a one dimensional example shows that under an oblivious policy for training there may be no solution to the PBE, or multiple solutions, and in each case the algorithm is not stable under oblivious training.
  The main contribution is that far more structure is required for convergence. An example is presented for which the basis is ideal, in the sense that the true Q-function is in the span of the basis. However, there are two solutions to the PBE under the greedy policy, and hence also for the $(\varepsilon,κ)$-tamed Gibbs policy for all sufficiently small $\varepsilon>0$ and $κ\ge 1$.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale large language models efficiently by sparsely activating experts, but once an expert is selected, it is executed fully. Hence, the trade-off between accuracy and computation in an MoE model typically exhibits large discontinuities. We propose Mixture of Slimmable Experts (MoSE), an MoE architecture in which each expert has a nested, slimmable structure that can be executed at variable widths. This enables conditional computation not only over which experts are activated, but also over how much of each expert is utilized. Consequently, a single pretrained MoSE model can support a more continuous spectrum of accuracy-compute trade-offs at inference time. We present a simple and stable training recipe for slimmable experts under sparse routing, combining multi-width training with standard MoE objectives. During inference, we explore strategies for runtime width determination, including a lightweight test-time training mechanism that learns how to map router confidence/probabilities to expert widths under a fixed budget. Experiments on GPT models trained on OpenWebText demonstrate that MoSE matches or improves upon standard MoE at full width and consistently shifts the Pareto frontier for accuracy vs. cost, achieving comparable performance with significantly fewer FLOPs.

Conclusion: 通过整合多种SBI密度估计器并改进优化策略，有效提升了贝叶斯最优实验设计的性能和可靠性。

Abstract: Bayesian optimal experimental design (BOED) seeks to maximize the expected information gain (EIG) of experiments. This requires a likelihood estimate, which in many settings is intractable. Simulation-based inference (SBI) provides powerful tools for this regime. However, existing work explicitly connecting SBI and BOED is restricted to a single contrastive EIG bound. We show that the EIG admits multiple formulations which can directly leverage modern SBI density estimators, encompassing neural posterior, likelihood, and ratio estimation. Building on this perspective, we define a novel EIG estimator using neural likelihood estimation. Further, we identify optimization as a key bottleneck of gradient based EIG maximization and show that a simple multi-start parallel gradient ascent procedure can substantially improve reliability and performance. With these innovations, our SBI-based BOED methods are able to match or outperform by up to $22\%$ existing state-of-the-art approaches across standard BOED benchmarks.

Abstract: Diffusion models rely on a high-dimensional latent space of initial noise seeds, yet it remains unclear whether this space contains sufficient structure to predict properties of the generated samples, such as their classes. In this work, we investigate the emergence of latent structure through the lens of confidence scores assigned by a pre-trained classifier to generated samples. We show that while the latent space appears largely unstructured when considering all noise realizations, restricting attention to initial noise seeds that produce high-confidence samples reveals pronounced class separability. By comparing class predictability across noise subsets of varying confidence and examining the class separability of the latent space, we find evidence of class-relevant latent structure that becomes observable only under confidence-based filtering. As a practical implication, we discuss how confidence-based filtering enables conditional generation as an alternative to guidance-based methods.

Abstract: DNA storage has matured from concept to practical stage, yet its integration with neural compression pipelines remains inefficient. Early DNA encoders applied redundancy-heavy constraint layers atop raw binary data - workable but primitive. Recent neural codecs compress data into learned latent representations with rich statistical structure, yet still convert these latents to DNA via naive binary-to-quaternary transcoding, discarding the entropy model's optimization. This mismatch undermines compression efficiency and complicates the encoding stack. A plug-in module that collapses latent compression and DNA encoding into a single step. SCONE performs quaternary arithmetic coding directly on the latent space in DNA bases. Its Constraint-Aware Adaptive Coding module dynamically steers the entropy encoder's learned probability distribution to enforce biochemical constraints - Guanine-Cytosine (GC) balance and homopolymer suppression - deterministically during encoding, eliminating post-hoc correction. The design preserves full reversibility and exploits the hyperprior model's learned priors without modification. Experiments show SCONE achieves near-perfect constraint satisfaction with negligible computational overhead (<2% latency), establishing a latent-agnostic interface for end-to-end DNA-compatible learned codecs.

Abstract: Trainings of Large Language Models are generally bottlenecked by matrix multiplications. In the Transformer architecture, a large portion of these operations happens in the Feed Forward Network (FFN), and this portion increases for larger models, up to 50% of the total pretraining floating point operations. We show that we can leverage hardware-accelerated sparsity to accelerate all matrix multiplications in the FFN, with 2:4 sparsity for weights and v:n:m (Venom) sparsity for activations. Our recipe relies on sparse training steps to accelerate a large part of the pretraining, associated with regular dense training steps towards the end. Overall, models trained with this approach exhibit the same performance on our quality benchmarks, and can speed up training end-to-end by 1.4 to 1.7x. This approach is applicable to all NVIDIA GPUs starting with the A100 generation, and is orthogonal to common optimization techniques, such as, quantization, and can also be applied to mixture-of-experts model architectures.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for collaborative machine learning across decentralized data sources, preserving privacy by keeping data local. However, increasing legal and ethical demands, such as the "right to be forgotten", and the need to mitigate data poisoning attacks have underscored the urgent necessity for principled data unlearning in FL. Unlike centralized settings, the distributed nature of FL complicates the removal of individual data contributions. In this paper, we propose a novel federated unlearning framework formulated as a min-max optimization problem, where the objective is to maximize an $f$-divergence between the model trained with all data and the model retrained without specific data points, while minimizing the degradation on retained data. Our framework could act like a plugin and be added to almost any federated setup, unlike SOTA methods like (\cite{10269017} which requires model degradation in server, or \cite{khalil2025notfederatedunlearningweight} which requires to involve model architecture and model weights). This formulation allows for efficient approximation of data removal effects in a federated setting. We provide empirical evaluations to show that our method achieves significant speedups over naive retraining, with minimal impact on utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA作为一种高效的微调方法，虽然内存占用小，但其训练动态复杂，尤其在调整适配器秩时需要重新调节学习率。目前的经验性调整方法效率低下，需要理论指导。

Method: 基于μP（最大更新参数化）理论框架，研究了LoRA微调中学习率随模型宽度和适配器秩的缩放规律，识别了学习率不变区和逆比例缩放区两种模式。

Result: 实验证明μA框架能准确预测学习率缩放规律，且LoRA上优化的学习率能有效迁移到全参数微调，显著减少调优成本。

Conclusion: μA框架为LoRA微调提供了理论指导，使不同秩设置下的学习率调优更高效，且能显著降低全参数微调的调优成本。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a standard tool for parameter-efficient finetuning of large models. While it induces a small memory footprint, its training dynamics can be surprisingly complex as they depend on several hyperparameters such as initialization, adapter rank, and learning rate. In particular, it is unclear how the optimal learning rate scales with adapter rank, which forces practitioners to re-tune the learning rate whenever the rank is changed. In this paper, we introduce Maximal-Update Adaptation ($μ$A), a theoretical framework that characterizes how the "optimal" learning rate should scale with model width and adapter rank to produce stable, non-vanishing feature updates under standard configurations. $μ$A is inspired from the Maximal-Update Parametrization ($μ$P) in pretraining. Our analysis leverages techniques from hyperparameter transfer and reveals that the optimal learning rate exhibits different scaling patterns depending on initialization and LoRA scaling factor. Specifically, we identify two regimes: one where the optimal learning rate remains roughly invariant across ranks, and another where it scales inversely with rank. We further identify a configuration that allows learning rate transfer from LoRA to full finetuning, drastically reducing the cost of learning rate tuning for full finetuning. Experiments across language, vision, vision--language, image generation, and reinforcement learning tasks validate our scaling rules and show that learning rates tuned on LoRA transfer reliably to full finetuning.

Abstract: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that independently trained neural networks converge to increasingly similar latent spaces. However, current strategies for mapping these representations are inherently pairwise, scaling quadratically with the number of models and failing to yield a consistent global reference. In this paper, we study the alignment of $M \ge 3$ models. We first adapt Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA) to construct a shared orthogonal universe that preserves the internal geometry essential for tasks like model stitching. We then show that strict isometric alignment is suboptimal for retrieval, where agreement-maximizing methods like Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) typically prevail. To bridge this gap, we finally propose Geometry-Corrected Procrustes Alignment (GCPA), which establishes a robust GPA-based universe followed by a post-hoc correction for directional mismatch. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GCPA consistently improves any-to-any retrieval while retaining a practical shared reference space.

Abstract: The growth of machine learning demands interpretable models for critical applications, yet most high-performing models are ``black-box'' systems that obscure input-output relationships, while traditional rule-based algorithms like RuleFit suffer from a lack of predictive power and instability despite their simplicity. This motivated our development of Sparse Relaxed Regularized Regression Rule-Fit (SR4-Fit), a novel interpretable classification algorithm that addresses these limitations while maintaining superior classification performance. Using demographic characteristics of U.S. congressional districts from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey, we demonstrate that SR4-Fit can predict House election party outcomes with unprecedented accuracy and interpretability. Our results show that while the majority party remains the strongest predictor, SR4-Fit has revealed intrinsic combinations of demographic factors that affect prediction outcomes that were unable to be interpreted in black-box algorithms such as random forests. The SR4-Fit algorithm surpasses both black-box models and existing interpretable rule-based algorithms such as RuleFit with respect to accuracy, simplicity, and robustness, generating stable and interpretable rule sets while maintaining superior predictive performance, thus addressing the traditional trade-off between model interpretability and predictive capability in electoral forecasting. To further validate SR4-Fit's performance, we also apply it to six additional publicly available classification datasets, like the breast cancer, Ecoli, page blocks, Pima Indians, vehicle, and yeast datasets, and find similar results.

Abstract: Game balancing is a longstanding challenge requiring repeated playtesting, expert intuition, and extensive manual tuning. We introduce RuleSmith, the first framework that achieves automated game balancing by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of multi-agent LLMs. It couples a game engine, multi-agent LLMs self-play, and Bayesian optimization operating over a multi-dimensional rule space. As a proof of concept, we instantiate RuleSmith on CivMini, a simplified civilization-style game containing heterogeneous factions, economy systems, production rules, and combat mechanics, all governed by tunable parameters. LLM agents interpret textual rulebooks and game states to generate actions, to conduct fast evaluation of balance metrics such as win-rate disparities. To search the parameter landscape efficiently, we integrate Bayesian optimization with acquisition-based adaptive sampling and discrete projection: promising candidates receive more evaluation games for accurate assessment, while exploratory candidates receive fewer games for efficient exploration. Experiments show that RuleSmith converges to highly balanced configurations and provides interpretable rule adjustments that can be directly applied to downstream game systems. Our results illustrate that LLM simulation can serve as a powerful surrogate for automating design and balancing in complex multi-agent environments.

TL;DR: PEPO是一种基于悲观集成策略的偏好优化算法，通过集成学习避免了偏好学习中的过度优化问题，不需要数据分布知识或显式奖励模型，在保持DPO式训练简单性的同时提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有偏好学习算法（如DPO）存在过度优化问题，容易受到样本选择偏差和模型偏差的影响。现有的悲观方法通常需要对数据生成分布有所了解，或需要学习显式的奖励模型，这增加了复杂性。PEPO旨在解决这一局限，提出一种既简单又有效的单步优化方法。

Method: PEPO采用集成学习方法，首先在不相交的数据子集上训练多个偏好优化的策略，然后通过最坏情况构造对这些策略进行聚合，强调模型间的一致性。通过这种悲观集成机制，算法仅依赖于单策略的集中性系数，避免了传统方法所需的全策略集中性前提，从而在理论保证上更稳健。

Result: 在理论分析中，PEPO的样本复杂度仅依赖于单策略的集中性系数，显著优于需要全策略集中性系数的传统方法（如DPO）。仿真实验进一步验证了PEPO的有效性，展现出更优良的性能表现，同时保留了DPO式训练的简单性。

Conclusion: PEPO提供了一个简单而强大的悲观偏好优化框架，能够有效缓解过度优化问题，无需显式奖励模型或先验分布知识。其理论保证和实验表现均显示出优越性，为偏好学习领域提供了一种新的实用方法。该算法的成功为未来的相关研究以及更复杂的集成策略设计奠定了基础。

Abstract: We introduce PEPO (Pessimistic Ensemble based Preference Optimization), a single-step Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)-like algorithm to mitigate the well-known over-optimization issue in preference learning without requiring the knowledge of the data-generating distribution or learning an explicit reward model. PEPO achieves pessimism via an ensemble of preference-optimized policies trained on disjoint data subsets and then aggregates them through a worst case construction that favors the agreement across models. In the tabular setting, PEPO achieves sample complexity guarantees depending only on a single-policy concentrability coefficient, thus avoiding the all-policy concentrability which affects the guarantees of algorithms prone to over-optimization, such as DPO. The theoretical findings are corroborated by a convincing practical performance, while retaining the simplicity and the practicality of DPO-style training.

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations offer an intuitive way to interpret graph neural networks (GNNs) by identifying minimal changes that alter a model's prediction, thereby answering "what must differ for a different outcome?". In this work, we propose a novel framework, ATEX-CF that unifies adversarial attack techniques with counterfactual explanation generation-a connection made feasible by their shared goal of flipping a node's prediction, yet differing in perturbation strategy: adversarial attacks often rely on edge additions, while counterfactual methods typically use deletions. Unlike traditional approaches that treat explanation and attack separately, our method efficiently integrates both edge additions and deletions, grounded in theory, leveraging adversarial insights to explore impactful counterfactuals. In addition, by jointly optimizing fidelity, sparsity, and plausibility under a constrained perturbation budget, our method produces instance-level explanations that are both informative and realistic. Experiments on synthetic and real-world node classification benchmarks demonstrate that ATEX-CF generates faithful, concise, and plausible explanations, highlighting the effectiveness of integrating adversarial insights into counterfactual reasoning for GNNs.

Abstract: Machine unlearning for LLMs aims to remove sensitive or copyrighted data from trained models. However, the true efficacy of current unlearning methods remains uncertain. Standard evaluation metrics rely on benign queries that often mistake superficial information suppression for genuine knowledge removal. Such metrics fail to detect residual knowledge that more sophisticated prompting strategies could still extract. We introduce REBEL, an evolutionary approach for adversarial prompt generation designed to probe whether unlearned data can still be recovered. Our experiments demonstrate that REBEL successfully elicits ``forgotten'' knowledge from models that seemed to be forgotten in standard unlearning benchmarks, revealing that current unlearning methods may provide only a superficial layer of protection. We validate our framework on subsets of the TOFU and WMDP benchmarks, evaluating performance across a diverse suite of unlearning algorithms. Our experiments show that REBEL consistently outperforms static baselines, recovering ``forgotten'' knowledge with Attack Success Rates (ASRs) reaching up to 60% on TOFU and 93% on WMDP. We will make all code publicly available upon acceptance. Code is available at https://github.com/patryk-rybak/REBEL/

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个评估模型引导方法特异性(specificity)的三维框架(通用性、控制性、鲁棒性)，并在两个安全关键应用中验证发现：虽然引导能有效改善目标属性且保持通用和控制特异性，但会显著降低鲁棒特异性，可能损害模型安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管模型引导方法已被广泛研究其有效性，但对其是否仅改变目标属性而保留其他相关能力的评估仍然有限，尤其是在安全关键应用中可能引发隐蔽的安全风险。需要系统性评估以确定引导方法在提升特定性能时是否损害其他相关属性。

Method: 提出了区分三维特异性的评估框架：1)通用特异性：保持流畅性和无关能力；2)控制特异性：保持相关控制属性；3)鲁棒特异性：在分布偏移下保持控制属性。应用于两个安全关键案例：减少过度拒绝和忠实性幻觉。

Result: 研究显示：1)引导方法在高有效性同时能保持通用和控制特异性；2)但所有方法都显著降低了鲁棒特异性，例如减少过度拒绝的引导会增加越狱攻击的脆弱性；3)标准有效性和特异性评估不足，缺乏鲁棒性评估可能掩盖安全风险。

Conclusion: 模型引导方法虽然在改善目标属性方面有效，但可能以牺牲鲁棒特异性为代价；仅依靠标准评估可能无法发现潜在的安全风险；需要系统性的鲁棒特异性评估来确保引导技术的可靠性和安全性。

Abstract: Model steering, which involves intervening on hidden representations at inference time, has emerged as a lightweight alternative to finetuning for precisely controlling large language models. While steering efficacy has been widely studied, evaluations of whether interventions alter only the intended property remain limited, especially with respect to unintended changes in behaviors related to the target property. We call this notion specificity. We propose a framework that distinguishes three dimensions of specificity: general (preserving fluency and unrelated abilities), control (preserving related control properties), and robustness (preserving control properties under distribution shifts). We study two safety-critical use cases: steering models to reduce overrefusal and faithfulness hallucinations, and show that while steering achieves high efficacy and largely maintains general and control specificity, it consistently fails to preserve robustness specificity. In the case of overrefusal steering, for example, all steering methods reduce overrefusal without harming general abilities and refusal on harmful queries; however, they substantially increase vulnerability to jailbreaks. Our work provides the first systematic evaluation of specificity in model steering, showing that standard efficacy and specificity checks are insufficient, because without robustness evaluation, steering methods may appear reliable even when they compromise model safety.

Motivation: 在线战略分类中，战略参与者会修改特征以获得有利预测，而现有方法在处理战略行为方面存在不足。虽然随机算法在战略设置中可能给学习者带来优势，但在这方面研究不足。在真实可学习设定中，缺乏随机算法的下界；在不可知学习设定中，最佳已知遗憾上界远未达到标准在线学习率。

Conclusion: 该研究显著推进了在线战略分类的理解，首次为随机学习设定了有意义的界限。结果表明proper学习的界限已接近最优，要进一步改进则需要不恰当学习方法。这为开发更有效的在线战略学习算法奠定了基础。

Abstract: Online strategic classification studies settings in which agents strategically modify their features to obtain favorable predictions. For example, given a classifier that determines loan approval based on credit scores, applicants may open or close credit cards and bank accounts to obtain a positive prediction. The learning goal is to achieve low mistake or regret bounds despite such strategic behavior.
  While randomized algorithms have the potential to offer advantages to the learner in strategic settings, they have been largely underexplored. In the realizable setting, no lower bound is known for randomized algorithms, and existing lower bound constructions for deterministic learners can be circumvented by randomization. In the agnostic setting, the best known regret upper bound is $O(T^{3/4}\log^{1/4}T|\mathcal H|)$, which is far from the standard online learning rate of $O(\sqrt{T\log|\mathcal H|})$.
  In this work, we provide refined bounds for online strategic classification in both settings. In the realizable setting, we extend, for $T > \mathrm{Ldim}(\mathcal{H}) Δ^2$, the existing lower bound $Ω(\mathrm{Ldim}(\mathcal{H}) Δ)$ for deterministic learners to all learners. This yields the first lower bound that applies to randomized learners. We also provide the first randomized learner that improves the known (deterministic) upper bound of $O(\mathrm{Ldim}(\mathcal H) \cdot Δ\log Δ)$.
  In the agnostic setting, we give a proper learner using convex optimization techniques to improve the regret upper bound to $O(\sqrt{T \log |\mathcal{H}|} + |\mathcal{H}| \log(T|\mathcal{H}|))$. We show a matching lower bound up to logarithmic factors for all proper learning rules, demonstrating the optimality of our learner among proper learners. As such, improper learning is necessary to further improve regret guarantees.

Abstract: Safety alignment is only as robust as its weakest failure mode. Despite extensive work on safety post-training, it has been shown that models can be readily unaligned through post-deployment fine-tuning. However, these methods often require extensive data curation and degrade model utility.
  In this work, we extend the practical limits of unalignment by introducing GRP-Obliteration (GRP-Oblit), a method that uses Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to directly remove safety constraints from target models. We show that a single unlabeled prompt is sufficient to reliably unalign safety-aligned models while largely preserving their utility, and that GRP-Oblit achieves stronger unalignment on average than existing state-of-the-art techniques. Moreover, GRP-Oblit generalizes beyond language models and can also unalign diffusion-based image generation systems.
  We evaluate GRP-Oblit on six utility benchmarks and five safety benchmarks across fifteen 7-20B parameter models, spanning instruct and reasoning models, as well as dense and MoE architectures. The evaluated model families include GPT-OSS, distilled DeepSeek, Gemma, Llama, Ministral, and Qwen.

Abstract: We consider the problem of minimizing different notions of swap regret in online optimization. These forms of regret are tightly connected to correlated equilibrium concepts in games, and have been more recently shown to guarantee non-manipulability against strategic adversaries. The only computationally efficient algorithm for minimizing linear swap regret over a general convex set in $\mathbb{R}^d$ was developed recently by Daskalakis, Farina, Fishelson, Pipis, and Schneider (STOC '25). However, it incurs a highly suboptimal regret bound of $Ω(d^4 \sqrt{T})$ and also relies on computationally intensive calls to the ellipsoid algorithm at each iteration.
  In this paper, we develop a significantly simpler, computationally efficient algorithm that guarantees $O(d^{3/2} \sqrt{T})$ linear swap regret for a general convex set and $O(d \sqrt{T})$ when the set is centrally symmetric. Our approach leverages the powerful response-based approachability framework of Bernstein and Shimkin (JMLR '15) -- previously overlooked in the line of work on swap regret minimization -- combined with geometric preconditioning via the John ellipsoid. Our algorithm simultaneously minimizes profile swap regret, which was recently shown to guarantee non-manipulability. Moreover, we establish a matching information-theoretic lower bound: any learner must incur in expectation $Ω(d \sqrt{T})$ linear swap regret for large enough $T$, even when the set is centrally symmetric. This also shows that the classic algorithm of Gordon, Greenwald, and Marks (ICML '08) is existentially optimal for minimizing linear swap regret, although it is computationally inefficient. Finally, we extend our approach to minimize regret with respect to the set of swap deviations with polynomial dimension, unifying and strengthening recent results in equilibrium computation and online learning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We propose a novel deterministic purification method to improve adversarial robustness by mapping a potentially adversarial sample toward a nearby sample that lies close to a mode of the data distribution, where classifiers are more reliable. We design the method to be deterministic to ensure reliable test accuracy and to prevent the degradation of effective robustness observed in stochastic purification approaches when the adversary has full knowledge of the system and its randomness. We employ a score model trained by minimizing the expected reconstruction error of noise-corrupted data, thereby learning the structural characteristics of the input data distribution. Given a potentially adversarial input, the method searches within its local neighborhood for a purified sample that minimizes the expected reconstruction error under noise corruption and then feeds this purified sample to the classifier. During purification, sharpness-aware minimization is used to guide the purified samples toward flat regions of the expected reconstruction error landscape, thereby enhancing robustness. We further show that, as the noise level decreases, minimizing the expected reconstruction error biases the purified sample toward local maximizers of the Gaussian-smoothed density; under additional local assumptions on the score model, we prove recovery of a local maximizer in the small-noise limit. Experimental results demonstrate significant gains in adversarial robustness over state-of-the-art methods under strong deterministic white-box attacks.

Motivation: 受隐私保护浏览器API和第三方cookie弃用的推动，研究在无法直接链接点击与转化的情况下如何训练预测模型，仅能观测到点击序列和转化序列，且一个转化只能关联到一个候选点击集合而非单一来源。

Method: 将问题形式化为从由具有先验分布的候选点击生成的归因集中学习，尽管缺乏显式标签，但通过新颖方法从这些粗粒度信号中构造出总体损失的无偏估计器；利用该估计器，经验风险最小化（ERM）能够获得与先验信息量相关的泛化保证。

Conclusion: 该工作为隐私约束下的转化预测提供了一种可行的学习框架，即使在没有明确标签的情况下也能通过归因集实现有效的模型训练，并在实际应用中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We address the problem of training conversion prediction models in advertising domains under privacy constraints, where direct links between ad clicks and conversions are unavailable. Motivated by privacy-preserving browser APIs and the deprecation of third-party cookies, we study a setting where the learner observes a sequence of clicks and a sequence of conversions, but can only link a conversion to a set of candidate clicks (an attribution set) rather than a unique source. We formalize this as learning from attribution sets generated by an oblivious adversary equipped with a prior distribution over the candidates. Despite the lack of explicit labels, we construct an unbiased estimator of the population loss from these coarse signals via a novel approach. Leveraging this estimator, we show that Empirical Risk Minimization achieves generalization guarantees that scale with the informativeness of the prior and is also robust against estimation errors in the prior, despite complex dependencies among attribution sets. Simple empirical evaluations on standard datasets suggest our unbiased approach significantly outperforms common industry heuristics, particularly in regimes where attribution sets are large or overlapping.

Conclusion: SOCKET将LSH从启发式候选生成提升为原理性评分核，为长上下文推理提供了高效且数学基础的稀疏注意力解决方案。

Abstract: Exploiting sparsity during long-context inference is central to scaling large language models, as attention dominates the cost of autoregressive decoding. Sparse attention reduces this cost by restricting computation to a subset of tokens, but its effectiveness depends critically on efficient scoring and selection of relevant tokens at inference time. We revisit Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) as a sparsification primitive and introduce SOCKET, a SOft Collision Kernel EsTimator that replaces hard bucket matches with probabilistic, similarity-aware aggregation. Our key insight is that hard LSH produces discrete collision signals and is therefore poorly suited for ranking. In contrast, soft LSH aggregates graded collision evidence across hash tables, preserving the stability of relative ordering among the true top-$k$ tokens. This transformation elevates LSH from a candidate-generation heuristic to a principled and mathematically grounded scoring kernel for sparse attention. Leveraging this property, SOCKET enables efficient token selection without ad-hoc voting mechanism, and matches or surpasses established sparse attention baselines across multiple long-context benchmarks using diverse set of models. With a custom CUDA kernel for scoring keys and a Flash Decode Triton backend for sparse attention, SOCKET achieves up to 1.5$\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention, making it an effective tool for long-context inference.

Abstract: We present the Condensate Theorem: attention sparsity is a learned topological property, not an architectural constraint. Through empirical analysis of trained language models, we find that attention mass concentrates on a distinct topological manifold -- and this manifold can be identified dynamically without checking every position. We prove a general result: for any query, projecting attention onto the Condensate Manifold (Anchor + Window + Dynamic Top-k) achieves 100% output equivalence with full $O(n^2)$ attention. This is not an approximation -- it is lossless parity. We validate this across GPT-2, Pythia, Qwen2, TinyLlama, and Mistral, demonstrating bit-exact token matching on 1,500+ generated tokens. By mapping this topology to hardware, our Topological Attention kernel achieves a 159x measured speedup at 131K tokens (3.94ms vs 628ms) and a projected >1,200x speedup at 1M tokens, reducing inference costs by >99.9% compared to Flash Attention. We conclude that the quadratic bottleneck is an artifact of naive implementation, not intelligence.

Abstract: Epidemiological forecasting from surveillance data is a hard problem and hybridizing mechanistic compartmental models with neural models is a natural direction. The mechanistic structure helps keep trajectories epidemiologically plausible, while neural components can capture non-stationary, data-adaptive effects. In practice, however, many seemingly straightforward couplings fail under partial observability and continually shifting transmission dynamics driven by behavior, waning immunity, seasonality, and interventions. We catalog these failure modes and show that robust performance requires making non-stationarity explicit: we extract multi-scale structure from the observed infection series and use it as an interpretable control signal for a controlled neural ODE coupled to an epidemiological model. Concretely, we decompose infections into trend, seasonal, and residual components and use these signals to drive continuous-time latent dynamics while jointly forecasting and inferring time-varying transmission, recovery, and immunity-loss rates. Across seasonal and non-seasonal settings, including early outbreaks and multi-wave regimes, our approach reduces long-horizon RMSE by 15-35%, improves peak timing error by 1-3 weeks, and lowers peak magnitude bias by up to 30% relative to strong time-series, neural ODE, and hybrid baselines, without relying on auxiliary covariates.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies trained in simulation often suffer from severe performance degradation when deployed in real-world environments due to non-stationary dynamics. While Domain Randomization (DR) and meta-RL have been proposed to address this issue, they typically rely on extensive pretraining, privileged information, or high computational cost, limiting their applicability to real-time and edge systems. In this paper, we propose a lightweight online adaptation framework for RL based on Reservoir Computing. Specifically, we integrate an Echo State Networks (ESNs) as an adaptation module that encodes recent observation histories into a latent context representation, and update its readout weights online using Recursive Least Squares (RLS). This design enables rapid adaptation without backpropagation, pretraining, or access to privileged information. We evaluate the proposed method on CartPole and HalfCheetah tasks with severe and abrupt environment changes, including periodic external disturbances and extreme friction variations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms DR and representative adaptive baselines under out-of-distribution dynamics, achieving stable adaptation within a few control steps. Notably, the method successfully handles intra-episode environment changes without resetting the policy. Due to its computational efficiency and stability, the proposed framework provides a practical solution for online adaptation in non-stationary environments and is well suited for real-world robotic control and edge deployment.

Abstract: Deploying trustworthy AI in open-world environments faces a dual challenge: the necessity for robust Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection to ensure system safety, and the demand for flexible machine unlearning to satisfy privacy compliance and model rectification. However, this objective encounters a fundamental geometric contradiction: current OOD detectors rely on a static and compact data manifold, whereas traditional classification-oriented unlearning methods disrupt this delicate structure, leading to a catastrophic loss of the model's capability to discriminate anomalies while erasing target classes. To resolve this dilemma, we first define the problem of boundary-preserving class unlearning and propose a pivotal conceptual shift: in the context of OOD detection, effective unlearning is mathematically equivalent to transforming the target class into OOD samples. Based on this, we propose the TFER (Total Free Energy Repulsion) framework. Inspired by the free energy principle, TFER constructs a novel Push-Pull game mechanism: it anchors retained classes within a low-energy ID manifold through a pull mechanism, while actively expelling forgotten classes to high-energy OOD regions using a free energy repulsion force. This approach is implemented via parameter-efficient fine-tuning, circumventing the prohibitive cost of full retraining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TFER achieves precise unlearning while maximally preserving the model's discriminative performance on remaining classes and external OOD data. More importantly, our study reveals that the unique Push-Pull equilibrium of TFER endows the model with inherent structural stability, allowing it to effectively resist catastrophic forgetting without complex additional constraints, thereby demonstrating exceptional potential in continual unlearning tasks.

Motivation: 现实应用中学习者必须与未知的任意对手进行博弈，且只能观察到实际动作的收益（强盗反馈）。在这种具有挑战性的设置下，$Ω(\sqrt{T})$的外部遗憾是不可避免的。为了克服这一障碍，需要探索更高效的遗憾度量与算法。

Method: 1.定义了纯策略最大最小遗憾这一新度量。2.在无信息强盗反馈（仅揭示实现收益）模型中，使用Tsallis-INF算法处理正规形式博弈，Tsallis-FTRL-SPM处理双线性博弈。3.在有信息强盗反馈（揭示收益和对手动作）模型中，提出Maximin-UCB算法处理正规形式博弈，Maximin-LinUCB处理双线性博弈。

Result: 1.无信息设置下：Tsallis-INF算法实现了$O(clogT)$的实例依赖遗憾，其中c是游戏相关参数，且证明了这种对c的依赖是必要的下界。2.有信息设置下：Maximin-UCB算法实现了$O(c'logT)$的遗憾界，其中c'是另一个可能远小于c的游戏相关参数。3.将结果推广到任意大动作集上的双线性博弈，建立了类似的游戏依赖对数遗憾界。

Conclusion: 通过定义纯策略最大最小遗憾并在无信息/有信息两种强盗反馈设置下设计算法，成功突破了零和博弈中$Ω(\sqrt{T})$遗憾的下界，实现了与游戏参数相关的对数遗憾率，为现实世界中限制性反馈下的对抗性学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Learning to play zero-sum games is a fundamental problem in game theory and machine learning. While significant progress has been made in minimizing external regret in the self-play settings or with full-information feedback, real-world applications often force learners to play against unknown, arbitrary opponents and restrict learners to bandit feedback where only the payoff of the realized action is observable. In such challenging settings, it is well-known that $Ω(\sqrt{T})$ external regret is unavoidable (where T is the number of rounds). To overcome this barrier, we investigate adversarial learning in zero-sum games under bandit feedback, aiming to minimize the deficit against the maximin pure strategy -- a metric we term Pure-Strategy Maximin Regret.
  We analyze this problem under two bandit feedback models: uninformed (only the realized reward is revealed) and informed (both the reward and the opponent's action are revealed). For uninformed bandit learning of normal-form games, we show that the Tsallis-INF algorithm achieves $O(c \log T)$ instance-dependent regret with a game-dependent parameter $c$. Crucially, we prove an information-theoretic lower bound showing that the dependence on c is necessary. To overcome this hardness, we turn to the informed setting and introduce Maximin-UCB, which obtains another regret bound of the form $O(c' \log T)$ for a different game-dependent parameter $c'$ that could potentially be much smaller than $c$. Finally, we generalize both results to bilinear games over an arbitrary, large action set, proposing Tsallis-FTRL-SPM and Maximin-LinUCB for the uninformed and informed setting respectively and establishing similar game-dependent logarithmic regret bounds.

Abstract: Label distribution learning (LDL) requires the learner to predict the degree of correlation between each sample and each label. To achieve this, a crucial task during learning is to leverage the correlation among labels. Deep Forest (DF) is a deep learning framework based on tree ensembles, whose training phase does not rely on backpropagation. DF performs in-model feature transform using the prediction of each layer and achieves competitive performance on many tasks. However, its exploration in the field of LDL is still in its infancy. The few existing methods that apply DF to the field of LDL do not have effective ways to utilize the correlation among labels. Therefore, we propose a method named Enhanced and Reused Feature Deep Forest (ERDF). It mainly contains two mechanisms: feature enhancement exploiting label correlation and measure-aware feature reuse. The first one is to utilize the correlation among labels to enhance the original features, enabling the samples to acquire more comprehensive information for the task of LDL. The second one performs a reuse operation on the features of samples that perform worse than the previous layer on the validation set, in order to ensure the stability of the training process. This kind of Enhance-Reuse pattern not only enables samples to enrich their features but also validates the effectiveness of their new features and conducts a reuse process to prevent the noise from spreading further. Experiments show that our method outperforms other comparison algorithms on six evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: LLM生成分布在低数据环境下能够有效支持决策，但需要采用基于决策效果的评估指标，而非传统的分布相似度指标来进行质量评估。

Abstract: LLMs can generate a wealth of data, ranging from simulated personas imitating human valuations and preferences, to demand forecasts based on world knowledge. But how well do such LLM-generated distributions support downstream decision-making? For example, when pricing a new product, a firm could prompt an LLM to simulate how much consumers are willing to pay based on a product description, but how useful is the resulting distribution for optimizing the price? We refer to this approach as LLM-SAA, in which an LLM is used to construct an estimated distribution and the decision is then optimized under that distribution. In this paper, we study metrics to evaluate the quality of these LLM-generated distributions, based on the decisions they induce. Taking three canonical decision-making problems (assortment optimization, pricing, and newsvendor) as examples, we find that LLM-generated distributions are practically useful, especially in low-data regimes. We also show that decision-agnostic metrics such as Wasserstein distance can be misleading when evaluating these distributions for decision-making.

Abstract: Spectral gradient descent (SpecGD) orthogonalizes the matrix parameter updates and has inspired practical optimizers such as Muon. They often perform well in large language model (LLM) training, but their dynamics remain poorly understood. In the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) setting, where weight updates are parameterized as a product of two low-rank factors, we find a distinctive spectral phenomenon under Muon in LoRA fine-tuning of LLMs: singular values of the LoRA product show near-uniform growth across the spectrum, despite orthogonalization being performed on the two factors separately. Motivated by this observation, we analyze spectral gradient flow (SpecGF)-a continuous-time analogue of SpecGD-in a simplified LoRA-style matrix factorization setting and prove "equal-rate" dynamics: all singular values grow at equal rates up to small deviations. Consequently, smaller singular values attain their target values earlier than larger ones, sharply contrasting with the largest-first stepwise learning observed in standard gradient flow. Moreover, we prove that SpecGF in our setting converges to global minima from almost all initializations, provided the factor norms remain bounded; with $\ell_2$ regularization, we obtain global convergence. Lastly, we corroborate our theory with experiments in the same setting.

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data enables sharing and analysis of sensitive records, but its practical deployment requires balancing distributional fidelity, downstream utility, and privacy protection. We study a simple, model agnostic post processing framework that can be applied on top of any synthetic data generator to improve this trade off. First, a mode patching step repairs categories that are missing or severely underrepresented in the synthetic data, while largely preserving learned dependencies. Second, a k nearest neighbor filter replaces synthetic records that lie too close to real data points, enforcing a minimum distance between real and synthetic samples. We instantiate this framework for two neural generative models for tabular data, a feed forward generator and a variational autoencoder, and evaluate it on three public datasets covering credit card transactions, cardiovascular health, and census based income. We assess marginal and joint distributional similarity, the performance of models trained on synthetic data and evaluated on real data, and several empirical privacy indicators, including nearest neighbor distances and attribute inference attacks. With moderate thresholds between 0.2 and 0.35, the post processing reduces divergence between real and synthetic categorical distributions by up to 36 percent and improves a combined measure of pairwise dependence preservation by 10 to 14 percent, while keeping downstream predictive performance within about 1 percent of the unprocessed baseline. At the same time, distance based privacy indicators improve and the success rate of attribute inference attacks remains largely unchanged. These results provide practical guidance for selecting thresholds and applying post hoc repairs to improve the quality and empirical privacy of synthetic tabular data, while complementing approaches that provide formal differential privacy guarantees.

Abstract: We study distributed adversarial bandits, where $N$ agents cooperate to minimize the global average loss while observing only their own local losses. We show that the minimax regret for this problem is $\tildeΘ(\sqrt{(ρ^{-1/2}+K/N)T})$, where $T$ is the horizon, $K$ is the number of actions, and $ρ$ is the spectral gap of the communication matrix. Our algorithm, based on a novel black-box reduction to bandits with delayed feedback, requires agents to communicate only through gossip. It achieves an upper bound that significantly improves over the previous best bound $\tilde{O}(ρ^{-1/3}(KT)^{2/3})$ of Yi and Vojnovic (2023). We complement this result with a matching lower bound, showing that the problem's difficulty decomposes into a communication cost $ρ^{-1/4}\sqrt{T}$ and a bandit cost $\sqrt{KT/N}$. We further demonstrate the versatility of our approach by deriving first-order and best-of-both-worlds bounds in the distributed adversarial setting. Finally, we extend our framework to distributed linear bandits in $R^d$, obtaining a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{(ρ^{-1/2}+1/N)dT})$, achieved with only $O(d)$ communication cost per agent and per round via a volumetric spanner.

Abstract: Tokenization is a promising path to multi-modal models capable of jointly understanding protein sequences, structure, and function. Existing protein structure tokenizers create tokens by pooling information from local neighborhoods, an approach that limits their performance on generative and representation tasks. In this work, we present a method for global tokenization of protein structures in which successive tokens contribute increasing levels of detail to a global representation. This change resolves several issues with generative models based on local protein tokenization: it mitigates error accumulation, provides embeddings without sequence-reduction operations, and allows task-specific adaptation of a tokenized sequence's information content. We validate our method on reconstruction, generative, and representation tasks and demonstrate that it matches or outperforms existing models based on local protein structure tokenizers. We show how adaptive tokens enable inference criteria based on information content, which boosts designability. We validate representations generated from our tokenizer on CATH classification tasks and demonstrate that non-linear probing on our tokenized sequences outperforms equivalent probing on representations from other tokenizers. Finally, we demonstrate how our method supports zero-shot protein shrinking and affinity maturation.

Abstract: Open source software (OSS) projects rely on complex networks of contributors whose interactions drive innovation and sustainability. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of OSS contributor networks using advanced graph neural networks and temporal network analysis on data spanning 25 years from the Cloud Native Computing Foundation ecosystem, encompassing sandbox, incubating, and graduated projects. Our analysis of thousands of contributors across hundreds of repositories reveals that OSS networks exhibit strong power-law distributions in influence, with the top 1\% of contributors controlling a substantial portion of network influence. Using GPU-accelerated PageRank, betweenness centrality, and custom LSTM models, we identify five distinct contributor roles: Core, Bridge, Connector, Regular, and Peripheral, each with unique network positions and structural importance. Statistical analysis reveals significant correlations between specific action types (commits, pull requests, issues) and contributor influence, with multiple regression models explaining substantial variance in influence metrics. Temporal analysis shows that network density, clustering coefficients, and modularity exhibit statistically significant temporal trends, with distinct regime changes coinciding with major project milestones. Structural integrity simulations show that Bridge contributors, despite representing a small fraction of the network, have a disproportionate impact on network cohesion when removed. Our findings provide empirical evidence for strategic contributor retention policies and offer actionable insights into community health metrics.

Abstract: Conceptual hydrologic models remain the cornerstone of rainfall-runoff modeling, yet their calibration is often slow and numerically fragile. Most gradient-based parameter estimation methods rely on finite-difference approximations or automatic differentiation frameworks (e.g., JAX, PyTorch and TensorFlow), which are computationally demanding and introduce truncation errors, solver instabilities, and substantial overhead. These limitations are particularly acute for the ODE systems of conceptual watershed models. Here we introduce a fully analytic and computationally efficient framework for differentiable hydrologic modeling based on exact parameter sensitivities. By augmenting the governing ODE system with sensitivity equations, we jointly evolve the model states and the Jacobian matrix with respect to all parameters. This Jacobian then provides fully analytic gradient vectors for any differentiable loss function. These include classical objective functions such as the sum of absolute and squared residuals, widely used hydrologic performance metrics such as the Nash-Sutcliffe and Kling-Gupta efficiencies, robust loss functions that down-weight extreme events, and hydrograph-based functionals such as flow-duration and recession curves. The analytic sensitivities eliminate the step-size dependence and noise inherent to numerical differentiation, while avoiding the instability of adjoint methods and the overhead of modern machine-learning autodiff toolchains. The resulting gradients are deterministic, physically interpretable, and straightforward to embed in gradient-based optimizers. Overall, this work enables rapid, stable, and transparent gradient-based calibration of conceptual hydrologic models, unlocking the full potential of differentiable modeling without reliance on external, opaque, or CPU-intensive automatic-differentiation libraries.

Abstract: For ethical and safe AI, machine unlearning rises as a critical topic aiming to protect sensitive, private, and copyrighted knowledge from misuse. To achieve this goal, it is common to conduct gradient ascent (GA) to reverse the training on undesired data. However, such a reversal is prone to catastrophic collapse, which leads to serious performance degradation in general tasks. As a solution, we propose model extrapolation as an alternative to GA, which reaches the counterpart direction in the hypothesis space from one model given another reference model. Therefore, we leverage the original model as the reference, further train it to memorize undesired data while keeping prediction consistency on the rest retained data, to obtain a memorization model. Counterfactual as it might sound, a forget model can be obtained via extrapolation from the memorization model to the reference model. Hence, we avoid directly acquiring the forget model using GA, but proceed with gradient descent for the memorization model, which successfully stabilizes the machine unlearning process. Our model extrapolation is simple and efficient to implement, and it can also effectively converge throughout training to achieve improved unlearning performance.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based scientific agents have accelerated scientific discovery, yet they often suffer from significant inefficiencies due to adherence to fixed initial priors. Existing approaches predominantly operate within a static hypothesis space, which restricts the discovery of novel phenomena, resulting in computational waste when baseline theories fail. To address this, we propose shifting the focus from searching hypotheses to evolving the underlying scientific principles. We present PiEvo, a principle-evolvable framework that treats scientific discovery as Bayesian optimization over an expanding principle space. By integrating Information-Directed Hypothesis Selection via Gaussian Process and an anomaly-driven augmentation mechanism, PiEvo enables agents to autonomously refine their theoretical worldview. Evaluation across four benchmarks demonstrates that PiEvo (1) achieves an average solution quality of up to 90.81%~93.15%, representing a 29.7%~31.1% improvement over the state-of-the-art, (2) attains an 83.3% speedup in convergence step via significantly reduced sample complexity by optimizing the compact principle space, and (3) maintains robust performance across diverse scientific domains and LLM backbones.

Abstract: Multi-modal learning combines various modalities to provide a comprehensive understanding of real-world problems. A common strategy is to directly bind different modalities together in a specific joint embedding space. However, the capability of existing methods is restricted within the modalities presented in the given dataset, thus they are biased when generalizing to unpresented modalities in downstream tasks. As a result, due to such inflexibility, the viability of previous methods is seriously hindered by the cost of acquiring multi-modal datasets. In this paper, we introduce BrokenBind, which focuses on binding modalities that are presented from different datasets. To achieve this, BrokenBind simultaneously leverages multiple datasets containing the modalities of interest and one shared modality. Though the two datasets do not correspond to each other due to distribution mismatch, we can capture their relationship to generate pseudo embeddings to fill in the missing modalities of interest, enabling flexible and generalized multi-modal learning. Under our framework, any two modalities can be bound together, free from the dataset limitation, to achieve universal modality exploration. Further, to reveal the capability of our method, we study intensified scenarios where more than two datasets are needed for modality binding and show the effectiveness of BrokenBind in low-data regimes. Through extensive evaluation, we carefully justify the superiority of BrokenBind compared to well-known multi-modal baseline methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种概率冲突解决框架，通过建模梯度为随机变量并使用不确定性感知的软投影机制来优化信号噪声比，从而解决GRPO训练稳定性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO训练稳定性存在瓶颈，表现为推理可塑性与通用能力保留之间的权衡。根本原因是可塑性与稳定性梯度的几何冲突会导致破坏性干扰，而确定性投影方法忽略了组基梯度估计的内在随机性

Method: 提出概率冲突解决框架，将梯度建模为随机变量，通过不确定性感知的软投影机制动态仲裁冲突，优化信号噪声比

Result: 实验表明PCR显著平滑了训练轨迹，在各种推理任务中取得了优越性能

Conclusion: PCR作为一种贝叶斯框架，通过概率冲突解决机制有效提高了GRPO的训练稳定性，为梯度冲突问题提供了更好的解决方案

Abstract: Training stability remains a critical bottleneck for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), often manifesting as a trade-off between reasoning plasticity and general capability retention. We identify a root cause as the geometric conflict between plasticity and stability gradients, which leads to destructive interference. Crucially, we argue that deterministic projection methods are suboptimal for GRPO as they overlook the intrinsic stochasticity of group-based gradient estimates. To address this, we propose Probabilistic Conflict Resolution (PCR), a Bayesian framework that models gradients as random variables. PCR dynamically arbitrates conflicts via an uncertainty-aware ``soft projection'' mechanism, optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PCR significantly smooths the training trajectory and achieves superior performance in various reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: 传统的概念漂移检测器主要通过比较数据流窗口检测分布变化，但存在"窗口困境"问题，即检测到的漂移可能源于窗口划分而非真实的数据生成过程变化；实证研究显示传统批处理方法往往优于漂移感知方法。

Motivation: 现有概念漂移检测器依赖窗口比较来识别数据流中的分布变化，但实践中无法验证检测到的漂移是否真实反映了底层数据生成过程的变化，导致检测问题本质上是病态的。

Method: 提出"窗口困境"理论分析漂移检测的根本缺陷；通过示例分析和实证比较，对比传统批处理方法与各种漂移感知方法的性能。

Result: 研究表明：1）检测到的漂移可能是窗口划分的产物而非真实数据变化；2）传统批处理方法在多数实验中表现优于漂移感知方法。

Conclusion: 概念漂移检测器在实际流分类任务中的作用受到质疑，其检测结果可能存在误导性；传统批处理方法可能比复杂的漂移检测策略更有效。

Abstract: Non-stationarity of an underlying data generating process that leads to distributional changes over time is a key characteristic of Data Streams. This phenomenon, commonly referred to as Concept Drift, has been intensively studied, and Concept Drift Detectors have been established as a class of methods for detecting such changes (drifts). For the most part, Drift Detectors compare regions (windows) of the data stream and detect drift if those windows are sufficiently dissimilar.
  In this work, we introduce the Window Dilemma, an observation that perceived drift is a product of windowing and not necessarily the underlying data generating process. Additionally, we highlight that drift detection is ill-posed, primarily because verification of drift events are implausible in practice. We demonstrate these contributions first by an illustrative example, followed by empirical comparisons of drift detectors against a variety of alternative adaptation strategies. Our main finding is that traditional batch learning techniques often perform better than their drift-aware counterparts further bringing into question the purpose of detectors in Stream Classification.

Abstract: Zero-shot generalization in contextual reinforcement learning remains a core challenge, particularly when the context is latent and must be inferred from data. A canonical failure mode is actuator inversion, where identical actions produce opposite physical effects under a latent binary context. We propose DMA*-SH, a framework where a single hypernetwork, trained solely via dynamics prediction, generates a small set of adapter weights shared across the dynamics model, policy, and action-value function. This shared modulation imparts an inductive bias matched to actuator inversion, while input/output normalization and random input masking stabilize context inference, promoting directionally concentrated representations. We provide theoretical support via an expressivity separation result for hypernetwork modulation, and a variance decomposition with policy-gradient variance bounds that formalize how within-mode compression improves learning under actuator inversion. For evaluation, we introduce the Actuator Inversion Benchmark (AIB), a suite of environments designed to isolate discontinuous context-to-dynamics interactions. On AIB's held-out actuator-inversion tasks, DMA*-SH achieves zero-shot generalization, outperforming domain randomization by 111.8% and surpassing a standard context-aware baseline by 16.1%.

Conclusion: 本文确立了在线双层优化在两种后悔指标下的最优后悔界限，提出的算法在理论和实验上均表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Online bilevel optimization (OBO) has emerged as a powerful framework for many machine learning problems. Prior works have developed several algorithms that minimize the standard bilevel local regret or the window-averaged bilevel local regret of the OBO problem, but the optimality of existing regret bounds remains unclear. In this work, we establish optimal regret bounds for both settings. For standard bilevel local regret, we propose an algorithm that achieves the optimal regret $Ω(1+V_T)$ with at most $O(T\log T)$ total inner-level gradient evaluations. We further develop a fully single-loop algorithm whose regret bound includes an additional gradient-variation terms. For the window-averaged bilevel local regret, we design an algorithm that captures sublinear environmental variation through a window-based analysis and achieves the optimal regret $Ω(T/W^2)$. Experiments validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex tasks with advances in reasoning capabilities. However, existing reward mechanisms remain tightly coupled to final correctness and pay little attention to the underlying reasoning process: trajectories with sound reasoning but wrong answers receive low credit, while lucky guesses with flawed logic may be highly rewarded, affecting reasoning generalization. From a causal perspective, we interpret multi-candidate reasoning for a fixed question as a family of counterfactual experiments with theoretical supports. Building on this, we propose Group Causal Counterfactual Policy Optimization to explicitly train LLMs to learn generalizable reasoning patterns. It proposes an episodic causal counterfactual reward that jointly captures (i) robustness, encouraging the answer distribution induced by a reasoning step to remain stable under counterfactual perturbations; and (ii) effectiveness, enforcing sufficient variability so that the learned reasoning strategy can transfer across questions. We then construct token-level advantages from this reward and optimize the policy, encouraging LLMs to favor reasoning patterns that are process-valid and counterfactually robust. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate its advantages.

Motivation: 现有基于过程奖励模型（PRM）的外部搜索方法在面对分布外推理路径时存在评估不确定性，这限制了大型语言模型在复杂问题解决中的表现，需要系统性地分析和解决这一根本限制。

Method: 首先通过实证分析PRM在分布外样本上的不确定性和不可靠评分，建立了理论框架证明标准搜索会带来线性遗憾累积，而不确定性感知策略能实现次线性遗憾。基于此提出了不确定性感知树搜索（UATS），使用蒙特卡洛Dropout估计不确定性，并通过基于强化学习的控制器动态分配计算预算。

Result: 大量实验证明，该方法有效减轻了分布外错误的影响，通过不确定性评估和动态预算分配提高了推理性能。

Conclusion: 论文系统分析了PRM在分布外样本上的不确定性挑战，提出了理论框架并设计了一个不确定性感知的搜索策略，实验验证了该方法能有效提升大型语言模型在复杂问题解决中的推理能力。

Abstract: Inference-time reasoning scaling has significantly advanced the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex problem-solving. A prevalent approach involves external search guided by Process Reward Models (PRMs). However, a fundamental limitation of this framework is the epistemic uncertainty of PRMs when evaluating reasoning paths that deviate from their training distribution. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of this challenge. We first provide empirical evidence that PRMs exhibit high uncertainty and unreliable scoring on out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. We then establish a theoretical framework proving that while standard search incurs linear regret accumulation, an uncertainty-aware strategy can achieve sublinear regret. Motivated by these findings, we propose Uncertainty-Aware Tree Search (UATS), a unified method that estimates uncertainty via Monte Carlo Dropout and dynamically allocates compute budget using a reinforcement learning-based controller. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach effectively mitigates the impact of OOD errors.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) show strong promise for complex reasoning, planning, and tool-augmented tasks, but designing effective MAS architectures remains labor-intensive, brittle, and hard to generalize. Existing automatic MAS generation methods either rely on code generation, which often leads to executability and robustness failures, or impose rigid architectural templates that limit expressiveness and adaptability. We propose Evolutionary Generation of Multi-Agent Systems (EvoMAS), which formulates MAS generation as structured configuration generation. EvoMAS performs evolutionary generation in configuration space. Specifically, EvoMAS selects initial configurations from a pool, applies feedback-conditioned mutation and crossover guided by execution traces, and iteratively refines both the candidate pool and an experience memory. We evaluate EvoMAS on diverse benchmarks, including BBEH, SWE-Bench, and WorkBench, covering reasoning, software engineering, and tool-use tasks. EvoMAS consistently improves task performance over both human-designed MAS and prior automatic MAS generation methods, while producing generated systems with higher executability and runtime robustness. EvoMAS outperforms the agent evolution method EvoAgent by +10.5 points on BBEH reasoning and +7.1 points on WorkBench. With Claude-4.5-Sonnet, EvoMAS also reaches 79.1% on SWE-Bench-Verified, matching the top of the leaderboard.

Abstract: Complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) are rising in popularity for all kinds of applications. To safely use CVNNs in practice, analyzing their robustness against outliers is crucial. One well known technique to understand the behavior of deep neural networks is to investigate their behavior under adversarial attacks, which can be seen as worst case minimal perturbations. We design Phase Attacks, a kind of attack specifically targeting the phase information of complex-valued inputs. Additionally, we derive complex-valued versions of commonly used adversarial attacks. We show that in some scenarios CVNNs are more robust than RVNNs and that both are very susceptible to phase changes with the Phase Attacks decreasing the model performance more, than equally strong regular attacks, which can attack both phase and magnitude.

Abstract: Adversarial attacks against deep neural networks are commonly constructed under $\ell_p$ norm constraints, most often using $p=1$, $p=2$ or $p=\infty$, and potentially regularized for specific demands such as sparsity or smoothness. These choices are typically made without a systematic investigation of how the norm parameter \( p \) influences the structural and perceptual properties of adversarial perturbations. In this work, we study how the choice of \( p \) affects sparsity and smoothness of adversarial attacks generated under \( \ell_p \) norm constraints for values of $p \in [1,2]$. To enable a quantitative analysis, we adopt two established sparsity measures from the literature and introduce three smoothness measures. In particular, we propose a general framework for deriving smoothness measures based on smoothing operations and additionally introduce a smoothness measure based on first-order Taylor approximations. Using these measures, we conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation across multiple real-world image datasets and a diverse set of model architectures, including both convolutional and transformer-based networks. We show that the choice of $\ell_1$ or $\ell_2$ is suboptimal in most cases and the optimal $p$ value is dependent on the specific task. In our experiments, using $\ell_p$ norms with $p\in [1.3, 1.5]$ yields the best trade-off between sparse and smooth attacks. These findings highlight the importance of principled norm selection when designing and evaluating adversarial attacks.

Abstract: Deep knowledge tracing models have achieved significant breakthroughs in modeling student learning trajectories. However, these architectures require substantial training time and are prone to overfitting on datasets with short sequences. In this paper, we explore a new paradigm for knowledge tracing by leveraging tabular foundation models (TFMs). Unlike traditional methods that require offline training on a fixed training set, our approach performs real-time ''live'' knowledge tracing in an online way. The core of our method lies in a two-way attention mechanism: while attention knowledge tracing models only attend across earlier time steps, TFMs simultaneously attend across both time steps and interactions of other students in the training set. They align testing sequences with relevant training sequences at inference time, therefore skipping the training step entirely. We demonstrate, using several datasets of increasing size, that our method achieves competitive predictive performance with up to 273x speedups, in a setting where more student interactions are observed over time.

Abstract: Weight initialization plays a crucial role in the optimization behavior and convergence efficiency of neural networks. Most existing initialization methods, such as Xavier and Kaiming initializations, rely on random sampling and do not exploit information from the optimization process itself. We propose a simple, yet effective, initialization strategy based on self-supervised pre-training using random noise as the target. Instead of directly training the network from random weights, we first pre-train it to fit random noise, which leads to a structured and non-random parameter configuration. We show that this noise-driven pre-training significantly improves convergence speed in subsequent tasks, without requiring additional data or changes to the network architecture. The proposed method is particularly effective for implicit neural representations (INRs) and Deep Image Prior (DIP)-style networks, which are known to exhibit a strong low-frequency bias during optimization. After noise-based pre-training, the network is able to capture high-frequency components much earlier in training, leading to faster and more stable convergence. Although random noise contains no semantic information, it serves as an effective self-supervised signal (considering its white spectrum nature) for shaping the initialization of neural networks. Overall, this work demonstrates that noise-based pre-training offers a lightweight and general alternative to traditional random initialization, enabling more efficient optimization of deep neural networks.

Abstract: Generalizing from limited data is particularly critical for models in domains such as material science, where task-relevant features in experimental datasets are often heavily confounded by measurement noise and experimental artifacts. Standard regularization techniques fail to precisely separate meaningful features from noise, while existing adversarial adaptation methods are limited by their reliance on explicit separation labels. To address this challenge, we propose the Adversarial Information Separation Framework (AdverISF), which isolates task-relevant features from noise without requiring explicit supervision. AdverISF introduces a self-supervised adversarial mechanism to enforce statistical independence between task-relevant features and noise representations. It further employs a multi-layer separation architecture that progressively recycles noise information across feature hierarchies to recover features inadvertently discarded as noise, thereby enabling finer-grained feature extraction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AdverISF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in data-scarce scenarios. In addition, evaluations on real-world material design tasks show that it achieves superior generalization performance.

Abstract: Model merging constructs versatile models by integrating task-specific models without requiring labeled data or expensive joint retraining. Although recent methods improve adaptability to heterogeneous tasks by generating customized merged models for each instance, they face two critical limitations. First, the instance-specific merged models lack reusability, restricting the exploitation of high-quality merging configurations and efficient batch inference. Second, these methods treat each task-specific model as a monolithic whole, overlooking the diverse mergeability of homologous components such as attention and multilayer perceptron layers, and the differing merging sensitivities across components. To address these limitations, we propose MERGE (\underline{M}odular \underline{E}xpert \underline{R}ecombination for fine-\underline{G}rained m\underline{E}rging), a method that enables component-wise model merging and input-aware, on-demand module recombination at inference. MERGE formulates component-wise merging as a bi-objective optimization problem that balances cross-task performance and storage efficiency, and develops a surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithm to efficiently identify Pareto-optimal merging configurations. These high-quality configurations underpin a reusable modular expert library, from which a lightweight routing network dynamically activates and recombines modular experts to assemble input-specific models and enable efficient inference under storage constraints. Extensive experiments across various model scales, task types, and fine-tuning strategies demonstrate that MERGE consistently outperforms strong baselines and generalizes effectively.

Motivation: 现实世界中的资源分配问题常常面临审查反馈（只有在预算超过随机阈值时才能观察到收益），且参数未知。现有研究未能充分考虑这种双重不确定性（激活概率和阈值分布），需要新的算法来处理这种复杂的探索-利用权衡。

Method: 提出两种算法：1) RA-UCB（已知预算情况）：使用乐观置信区间方法，结合非平凡的参数估计技术；2) MG-UCB（未知预算情况）：支持轮内切换和无穷小分配，匹配RA-UCB的后悔保证。两种算法都基于UCB框架，但针对审查反馈特性进行了专门设计。

Result: 1) 证明了信息论后悔下界Ω(T^{1/3})；2) RA-UCB在预算已知时达到O~(√T)的后悔上界，在更强假设下可达O(poly-log T)；3) MG-UCB在预算未知时匹配RA-UCB的性能；4) 在真实数据集上的实验验证了理论结果。

Conclusion: 该研究为带有审查反馈的在线资源分配问题提供了第一个系统的理论分析框架，设计了高效的算法，并建立了匹配的上下界。算法能有效处理双重不确定性，在实际数据上表现良好，对该领域有重要贡献。

Abstract: We study the online resource allocation problem in which at each round, a budget $B$ must be allocated across $K$ arms under censored feedback. An arm yields a reward if and only if two conditions are satisfied: (i) the arm is activated according to an arm-specific Bernoulli random variable with unknown parameter, and (ii) the allocated budget exceeds a random threshold drawn from a parametric distribution with unknown parameter. Over $T$ rounds, the learner must jointly estimate the unknown parameters and allocate the budget so as to maximize cumulative reward facing the exploration--exploitation trade-off. We prove an information-theoretic regret lower bound $Ω(T^{1/3})$, demonstrating the intrinsic difficulty of the problem. We then propose RA-UCB, an optimistic algorithm that leverages non-trivial parameter estimation and confidence bounds. When the budget $B$ is known at the beginning of each round, RA-UCB achieves a regret of order $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$, and even $\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{poly}\text{-}\log T)$ under stronger assumptions. As for unknown, round dependent budget, we introduce MG-UCB, which allows within-round switching and infinitesimal allocations, and matches the regret guarantees of RA-UCB. We then validate our theoretical results through experiments on real-world datasets.

Motivation: 现有联邦学习攻击主要针对准确性或植入后门，而置信度校准作为关键系统的重要控制信号，尚未被充分研究作为一种独立的攻击目标。研究者发现通过操纵置信度校准可以影响系统的风险感知逻辑，产生严重后果。

Method: 提出温度缩放攻击，通过在客户端的本地训练中注入学习率-温度耦合机制，使恶意更新保持与良性更新相似的优化行为，从而逃避基于精度和相似性的检测，同时系统地扭曲置信度校准。

Result: 在三个基准测试中，TSA能够显著改变校准（CIFAR-100上校准误差增加145%），同时准确率变化小于2%。即使在鲁棒聚合和后校准防御下也保持有效，在医疗和自动驾驶场景中可能导致关键案例漏判增加7.2倍。

Conclusion: 本文确立了置信度校准的完整性是联邦学习中的一个重要攻击面，需要在安全评估中引起重视。

Abstract: Predictive confidence serves as a foundational control signal in mission-critical systems, directly governing risk-aware logic such as escalation, abstention, and conservative fallback. While prior federated learning attacks predominantly target accuracy or implant backdoors, we identify confidence calibration as a distinct attack objective. We present the Temperature Scaling Attack (TSA), a training-time attack that degrades calibration while preserving accuracy. By injecting temperature scaling with learning rate-temperature coupling during local training, malicious updates maintain benign-like optimization behavior, evading accuracy-based monitoring and similarity-based detection. We provide a convergence analysis under non-IID settings, showing that this coupling preserves standard convergence bounds while systematically distorting confidence. Across three benchmarks, TSA substantially shifts calibration (e.g., 145% error increase on CIFAR-100) with <2 accuracy change, and remains effective under robust aggregation and post-hoc calibration defenses. Case studies further show that confidence manipulation can cause up to 7.2x increases in missed critical cases (healthcare) or false alarms (autonomous driving), even when accuracy is unchanged. Overall, our results establish calibration integrity as a critical attack surface in federated learning.

Abstract: Generative models for de novo protein backbone design have achieved remarkable success in creating novel protein structures. However, these diffusion-based approaches remain computationally intensive and slower than desired for large-scale structural exploration. While recent efforts like Proteina have introduced flow-matching to improve sampling efficiency, the potential of tokenization for structural compression and acceleration remains largely unexplored in the protein domain. In this work, we present SaDiT, a novel framework that accelerates protein backbone generation by integrating SaProt Tokenization with a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. SaDiT leverages a discrete latent space to represent protein geometry, significantly reducing the complexity of the generation process while maintaining theoretical SE(3) equivalence. To further enhance efficiency, we introduce an IPA Token Cache mechanism that optimizes the Invariant Point Attention (IPA) layers by reusing computed token states during iterative sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that SaDiT outperforms state-of-the-art models, including RFDiffusion and Proteina, in both computational speed and structural viability. We evaluate our model across unconditional backbone generation and fold-class conditional generation tasks, where SaDiT shows superior ability to capture complex topological features with high designability.

TL;DR: 本文针对强化学习中的可验证奖励 (RLVR) 方法，分析了组采样导致的罕见正确轨迹被忽略的问题，提出了一种基于难度感知的优势缩放系数改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的RLVR方法依赖于组采样来估计优势和稳定策略更新，但受限于计算成本，大组尺寸不现实，小组尺寸又会错过罕见的正确轨迹，导致学习偏向已有高概率轨迹，而忽略了正确的稀有模式。

Method: 作者通过理论推导分析了不同组尺寸下错过罕见正确模式的概率，并提出了一个轻量级的难度感知优势缩放系数，该系数受Focal loss启发，可对高成功率提示的更新进行降权处理。该方法可直接集成到GRPO、DAPO、CISPO等组相对RLVR算法中。

Result: 在Qwen2.5-7B模型的多领域基准测试中，该方法显著提升了pass@256指标（GRPO提升6.2%，DAPO提升3.2%，CISPO提升3.6%），同时保持或提升了pass@1指标，且未增加组尺寸或计算成本。

Conclusion: 提出的难度感知优势缩放系数有效缓解了RLVR中组采样对罕见正确轨迹的忽略问题，在不增加计算开销的情况下，显著提升了模型对困难提示的泛化能力，为现有RLVR算法提供了简单有效的改进方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is commonly based on group sampling to estimate advantages and stabilize policy updates. In practice, large group sizes are not feasible due to computational limits, which biases learning toward trajectories that are already likely. Smaller groups often miss rare-correct trajectories while still containing mixed rewards, concentrating probability on common solutions. We derive the probability that updates miss rare-correct modes as a function of group size, showing non-monotonic behavior, and characterize how updates redistribute mass within the correct set, revealing that unsampled-correct mass can shrink even as total correct mass grows. Motivated by this analysis, we propose a difficulty-aware advantage scaling coefficient, inspired by Focal loss, that down-weights updates on high-success prompts. The lightweight modification can be directly integrated into any group-relative RLVR algorithm such as GRPO, DAPO, and CISPO. On Qwen2.5-7B across in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, our method improves pass@256 from 64.1 $\rightarrow$ 70.3 (GRPO), 69.3 $\rightarrow$ 72.5 (DAPO), and 73.2 $\rightarrow$ 76.8 (CISPO), while preserving or improving pass@1, without increasing group size or computational cost.

Abstract: We present a novel approach for verifying properties of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), a class of neural networks characterized by nonlinear, univariate activation functions typically implemented as piecewise polynomial splines or Gaussian processes. Our method creates mathematical ``abstractions'' by replacing each KAN unit with a piecewise affine (PWA) function, providing both local and global error estimates between the original network and its approximation. These abstractions enable property verification by encoding the problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP), determining whether outputs satisfy specified properties when inputs belong to a given set. A critical challenge lies in balancing the number of pieces in the PWA approximation: too many pieces add binary variables that make verification computationally intractable, while too few pieces create excessive error margins that yield uninformative bounds. Our key contribution is a systematic framework that exploits KAN structure to find optimal abstractions. By combining dynamic programming at the unit level with a knapsack optimization across the network, we minimize the total number of pieces while guaranteeing specified error bounds. This approach determines the optimal approximation strategy for each unit while maintaining overall accuracy requirements. Empirical evaluation across multiple KAN benchmarks demonstrates that the upfront analysis costs of our method are justified by superior verification results.

Abstract: Centralized training is the standard paradigm in deep learning, enabling models to learn from a unified dataset in a single location. In such setup, isotropic feature distributions naturally arise as a mean to support well-structured and generalizable representations. In contrast, continual learning operates on streaming and non-stationary data, and trains models incrementally, inherently facing the well-known plasticity-stability dilemma. In such settings, learning dynamics tends to yield increasingly anisotropic feature space. This arises a fundamental question: should isotropy be enforced to achieve a better balance between stability and plasticity, and thereby mitigate catastrophic forgetting? In this paper, we investigate whether promoting feature-space isotropy can enhance representation quality in continual learning. Through experiments using contrastive continual learning techniques on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 data, we find that isotropic regularization fails to improve, and can in fact degrade, model accuracy in continual settings. Our results highlight essential differences in feature geometry between centralized and continual learning, suggesting that isotropy, while beneficial in centralized setups, may not constitute an appropriate inductive bias for non-stationary learning scenarios.

Abstract: While generative modeling on time series facilitates more capable and flexible probabilistic forecasting, existing generative time series models do not address the multi-dimensional properties of time series data well. The prevalent architecture of Diffusion Transformers (DiT), which relies on simplistic conditioning controls and a single-stream Transformer backbone, tends to underutilize cross-variate dependencies in covariate-aware forecasting. Inspired by Multimodal Diffusion Transformers that integrate textual guidance into video generation, we propose Diffusion Transformers for Time Series (DiTS), a general-purpose architecture that frames endogenous and exogenous variates as distinct modalities. To better capture both inter-variate and intra-variate dependencies, we design a dual-stream Transformer block tailored for time-series data, comprising a Time Attention module for autoregressive modeling along the temporal dimension and a Variate Attention module for cross-variate modeling. Unlike the common approach for images, which flattens 2D token grids into 1D sequences, our design leverages the low-rank property inherent in multivariate dependencies, thereby reducing computational costs. Experiments show that DiTS achieves state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks, regardless of the presence of future exogenous variate observations, demonstrating unique generative forecasting strengths over traditional deterministic deep forecasting models.

Abstract: Concept erasure helps stop diffusion models (DMs) from generating harmful content; but current methods face robustness retention trade off. Robustness means the model fine-tuned by concept erasure methods resists reactivation of erased concepts, even under semantically related prompts. Retention means unrelated concepts are preserved so the model's overall utility stays intact. Both are critical for concept erasure in practice, yet addressing them simultaneously is challenging, as existing works typically improve one factor while sacrificing the other. Prior work typically strengthens one while degrading the other, e.g., mapping a single erased prompt to a fixed safe target leaves class level remnants exploitable by prompt attacks, whereas retention-oriented schemes underperform against adaptive adversaries. This paper introduces Adversarial Erasure with Gradient Informed Synergy (AEGIS), a retention-data-free framework that advances both robustness and retention.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (ORL) has shown potential for improving decision-making in healthcare. However, contemporary research typically aggregates patient data into fixed time intervals, simplifying their mapping to standard ORL frameworks. The impact of these temporal manipulations on model safety and efficacy remains poorly understood. In this work, using both a gridworld navigation task and the UVA/Padova clinical diabetes simulator, we demonstrate that temporal resampling significantly degrades the performance of offline reinforcement learning algorithms during live deployment. We propose three mechanisms that drive this failure: (i) the generation of counterfactual trajectories, (ii) the distortion of temporal expectations, and (iii) the compounding of generalisation errors. Crucially, we find that standard off-policy evaluation metrics can fail to detect these drops in performance. Our findings reveal a fundamental risk in current healthcare ORL pipelines and emphasise the need for methods that explicitly handle the irregular timing of clinical decision-making.

Motivation: 当前广泛应用的激活导向方法（如人物向量）被认为能揭示模型的有意义的内部表征，但这种解释隐含地假设导向方向具有可识别性且能从输入输出行为中唯一恢复。研究旨在检验这种假设是否成立。

Abstract: Activation steering methods, such as persona vectors, are widely used to control large language model behavior and increasingly interpreted as revealing meaningful internal representations. This interpretation implicitly assumes steering directions are identifiable and uniquely recoverable from input-output behavior. We formalize steering as an intervention on internal representations and prove that, under realistic modeling and data conditions, steering vectors are fundamentally non-identifiable due to large equivalence classes of behaviorally indistinguishable interventions. Empirically, we validate this across multiple models and semantic traits, showing orthogonal perturbations achieve near-equivalent efficacy with negligible effect sizes. However, identifiability is recoverable under structural assumptions including statistical independence, sparsity constraints, multi-environment validation or cross-layer consistency. These findings reveal fundamental interpretability limits and clarify structural assumptions required for reliable safety-critical control.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) shows promise for aligning diffusion and flow models, yet policy optimization methods such as GRPO suffer from inefficient and static sampling strategies. These methods treat all prompts and denoising steps uniformly, ignoring substantial variations in sample learning value as well as the dynamic nature of critical exploration moments.
  To address this issue, we conduct a detailed analysis of the internal attention dynamics during GRPO training and uncover a key insight: attention entropy can serve as a powerful dual-signal proxy. First, across different samples, the relative change in attention entropy (ΔEntropy), which reflects the divergence between the current policy and the base policy, acts as a robust indicator of sample learning value. Second, during the denoising process, the peaks of absolute attention entropy (Entropy(t)), which quantify attention dispersion, effectively identify critical timesteps where high-value exploration occurs.
  Building on this observation, we propose Adaptive Entropy-Guided Policy Optimization (AEGPO), a novel dual-signal, dual-level adaptive optimization strategy. At the global level, AEGPO uses ΔEntropy to dynamically allocate rollout budgets, prioritizing prompts with higher learning value. At the local level, it exploits the peaks of Entropy(t) to guide exploration selectively at critical high-dispersion timesteps rather than uniformly across all denoising steps.
  By focusing computation on the most informative samples and the most critical moments, AEGPO enables more efficient and effective policy optimization. Experiments on text-to-image generation tasks demonstrate that AEGPO significantly accelerates convergence and achieves superior alignment performance compared to standard GRPO variants.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of outcomes is crucial for clinical decision-making and personalized patient care. Supervised machine learning algorithms, which are commonly used for outcome prediction in the medical domain, optimize for predictive accuracy, which can result in models latching onto spurious correlations instead of robust predictors. Causal structure learning methods on the other hand have the potential to provide robust predictors for the target, but can be too conservative because of algorithmic and data assumptions, resulting in loss of diagnostic precision. Therefore, we propose a novel model-agnostic regularization strategy, Adaptive-CaRe, for generalized outcome prediction in the medical domain. Adaptive-CaRe strikes a balance between both predictive value and causal robustness by incorporating a penalty that is proportional to the difference between the estimated statistical contribution and estimated causal contribution of the input features for model predictions. Our experiments on synthetic data establish the efficacy of the proposed Adaptive-CaRe regularizer in finding robust predictors for the target while maintaining competitive predictive accuracy. With experiments on a standard causal benchmark, we provide a blueprint for navigating the trade-off between predictive accuracy and causal robustness by tweaking the regularization strength, $λ$. Validation using real-world dataset confirms that the results translate to practical, real-domain settings. Therefore, Adaptive-CaRe provides a simple yet effective solution to the long-standing trade-off between predictive accuracy and causal robustness in the medical domain. Future work would involve studying alternate causal structure learning frameworks and complex classification models to provide deeper insights at a larger scale.

Abstract: Pruning at Initialisation methods discover sparse, trainable subnetworks before training, but their theoretical mechanisms remain elusive. Existing analyses are often limited to finite-width statistics, lacking a rigorous characterisation of the global sparsity patterns that emerge as networks grow large. In this work, we connect discrete pruning heuristics to graph limit theory via graphons, establishing the graphon limit of PaI masks. We introduce a Factorised Saliency Model that encompasses popular pruning criteria and prove that, under regularity conditions, the discrete masks generated by these algorithms converge to deterministic bipartite graphons. This limit framework establishes a novel topological taxonomy for sparse networks: while unstructured methods (e.g., Random, Magnitude) converge to homogeneous graphons representing uniform connectivity, data-driven methods (e.g., SNIP, GraSP) converge to heterogeneous graphons that encode implicit feature selection. Leveraging this continuous characterisation, we derive two fundamental theoretical results: (i) a Universal Approximation Theorem for sparse networks that depends only on the intrinsic dimension of active coordinate subspaces; and (ii) a Graphon-NTK generalisation bound demonstrating how the limit graphon modulates the kernel geometry to align with informative features. Our results transform the study of sparse neural networks from combinatorial graph problems into a rigorous framework of continuous operators, offering a new mechanism for analysing expressivity and generalisation in sparse neural networks.

Abstract: Autoregressive generative PDE solvers can be accurate one step ahead yet drift over long rollouts, especially in coarse-to-fine regimes where each step must regenerate unresolved fine scales. This is the regime of diffusion and flow-matching generators: although their internal dynamics are Markovian, rollout stability is governed by per-step \emph{conditional law} errors. Using the Mori--Zwanzig projection formalism, we show that eliminating unresolved variables yields an exact resolved evolution with a Markov term, a memory term, and an orthogonal forcing, exposing a structural limitation of memoryless closures. Motivated by this, we introduce memory-conditioned diffusion/flow-matching with a compact online state injected into denoising via latent features. Via disintegration, memory induces a structured conditional tail prior for unresolved scales and reduces the transport needed to populate missing frequencies. We prove Wasserstein stability of the resulting conditional kernel. We then derive discrete Grönwall rollout bounds that separate memory approximation from conditional generation error. Experiments on compressible flows with shocks and multiscale mixing show improved accuracy and markedly more stable long-horizon rollouts, with better fine-scale spectral and statistical fidelity.

Abstract: Weight-only quantization has become a standard approach for efficiently serving large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods fail to efficiently compress models to binary (1-bit) levels, as they either require large amounts of data and compute or incur additional storage. In this work, we propose NanoQuant, the first post-training quantization (PTQ) method to compress LLMs to both binary and sub-1-bit levels. NanoQuant formulates quantization as a low-rank binary factorization problem, and compresses full-precision weights to low-rank binary matrices and scales. Specifically, it utilizes an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method to precisely initialize latent binary matrices and scales, and then tune the initialized parameters through a block and model reconstruction process. Consequently, NanoQuant establishes a new Pareto frontier in low-memory post-training quantization, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy even at sub-1-bit compression rates. NanoQuant makes large-scale deployment feasible on consumer hardware. For example, it compresses Llama2-70B by 25.8$\times$ in just 13 hours on a single H100, enabling a 70B model to operate on a consumer 8 GB GPU.

Motivation: 当前通用AI架构（如Transformer）虽然预测精度高，但缺乏对物理世界底层因果规律的真正理解，只是曲线拟合而非发现物理定律。需要探究如何让通用架构超越预测，获得类似'世界模型'的物理洞察能力。

Method: 1）空间平滑性偏置：将预测表述为连续回归问题；2）稳定性偏置：使用含噪声的上下文训练以缓解误差累积；3）时间局部性偏置：将注意力窗口限制在近期历史，假设未来状态仅依赖于局部状态而非复杂历史。

Result: 1）引入空间平滑性和稳定性偏置后，通用Transformers能够学习连贯的开普勒世界模型，成功拟合行星轨道的椭圆轨迹；2）进一步加入时间局部性偏置后，模型放弃了曲线拟合，发现了牛顿力学的力表示形式。

Conclusion: 简单的架构选择决定了AI是成为曲线拟合器还是物理学家，这是实现自动化科学发现的关键一步。三个最小归纳偏置能使通用AI架构从预测器转变为物理定律的发现者。

Abstract: Can general-purpose AI architectures go beyond prediction to discover the physical laws governing the universe? True intelligence relies on "world models" -- causal abstractions that allow an agent to not only predict future states but understand the underlying governing dynamics. While previous "AI Physicist" approaches have successfully recovered such laws, they typically rely on strong, domain-specific priors that effectively "bake in" the physics. Conversely, Vafa et al. recently showed that generic Transformers fail to acquire these world models, achieving high predictive accuracy without capturing the underlying physical laws. We bridge this gap by systematically introducing three minimal inductive biases. We show that ensuring spatial smoothness (by formulating prediction as continuous regression) and stability (by training with noisy contexts to mitigate error accumulation) enables generic Transformers to surpass prior failures and learn a coherent Keplerian world model, successfully fitting ellipses to planetary trajectories. However, true physical insight requires a third bias: temporal locality. By restricting the attention window to the immediate past -- imposing the simple assumption that future states depend only on the local state rather than a complex history -- we force the model to abandon curve-fitting and discover Newtonian force representations. Our results demonstrate that simple architectural choices determine whether an AI becomes a curve-fitter or a physicist, marking a critical step toward automated scientific discovery.

Abstract: Non-Markovian dynamics are commonly found in real-world environments due to long-range dependencies, partial observability, and memory effects. The Bellman equation that is the central pillar of Reinforcement learning (RL) becomes only approximately valid under Non-Markovian. Existing work often focus on practical algorithm designs and offer limited theoretical treatment to address key questions, such as what dynamics are indeed capturable by the Bellman framework and how to inspire new algorithm classes with optimal approximations. In this paper, we present a novel topological viewpoint on temporal-difference (TD) based RL. We show that TD errors can be viewed as 1-cochain in the topological space of state transitions, while Markov dynamics are then interpreted as topological integrability. This novel view enables us to obtain a Hodge-type decomposition of TD errors into an integrable component and a topological residual, through a Bellman-de Rham projection. We further propose HodgeFlow Policy Search (HFPS) by fitting a potential network to minimize the non-integrable projection residual in RL, achieving stability/sensitivity guarantees. In numerical evaluations, HFPS is shown to significantly improve RL performance under non-Markovian.

Abstract: We investigate grokking in transformers through the lens of inductive bias: dispositions arising from architecture or optimization that let the network prefer one solution over another. We first show that architectural choices such as the position of Layer Normalization (LN) strongly modulates grokking speed. This modulation is explained by isolating how LN on specific pathways shapes shortcut-learning and attention entropy. Subsequently, we study how different optimization settings modulate grokking, inducing distinct interpretations of previously proposed controls such as readout scale. Particularly, we find that using readout scale as a control for lazy training can be confounded by learning rate and weight decay in our setting. Accordingly, we show that features evolve continuously throughout training, suggesting grokking in transformers can be more nuanced than a lazy-to-rich transition of the learning regime. Finally, we show how generalization predictably emerges with feature compressibility in grokking, across different modulators of inductive bias. Our code is released at https://tinyurl.com/y52u3cad.

Abstract: Large language models can resist task-misaligned activation steering during inference, sometimes recovering mid-generation to produce improved responses even when steering remains active. We term this Endogenous Steering Resistance (ESR). Using sparse autoencoder (SAE) latents to steer model activations, we find that Llama-3.3-70B shows substantial ESR, while smaller models from the Llama-3 and Gemma-2 families exhibit the phenomenon less frequently. We identify 26 SAE latents that activate differentially during off-topic content and are causally linked to ESR in Llama-3.3-70B. Zero-ablating these latents reduces the multi-attempt rate by 25%, providing causal evidence for dedicated internal consistency-checking circuits. We demonstrate that ESR can be deliberately enhanced through both prompting and training: meta-prompts instructing the model to self-monitor increase the multi-attempt rate by 4x for Llama-3.3-70B, and fine-tuning on self-correction examples successfully induces ESR-like behavior in smaller models. These findings have dual implications: ESR could protect against adversarial manipulation but might also interfere with beneficial safety interventions that rely on activation steering. Understanding and controlling these resistance mechanisms is important for developing transparent and controllable AI systems.

Abstract: Existing approaches for analyzing neural network activations, such as PCA and sparse autoencoders, rely on strong structural assumptions. Generative models offer an alternative: they can uncover structure without such assumptions and act as priors that improve intervention fidelity. We explore this direction by training diffusion models on one billion residual stream activations, creating "meta-models" that learn the distribution of a network's internal states. We find that diffusion loss decreases smoothly with compute and reliably predicts downstream utility. In particular, applying the meta-model's learned prior to steering interventions improves fluency, with larger gains as loss decreases. Moreover, the meta-model's neurons increasingly isolate concepts into individual units, with sparse probing scores that scale as loss decreases. These results suggest generative meta-models offer a scalable path toward interpretability without restrictive structural assumptions. Project page: https://generative-latent-prior.github.io.

The main challenge lies in obtaining disentangled representations, where each latent dimension corresponds to a distinct generative factor. This difficulty is fundamentally tied to the inability to perform nonlinear independent component analysis. Here, we introduce the framework of action-induced representations (AIRs) which models representations of physical systems given experiments (or actions) that can be performed on them. We show that, in this framework, we can provably disentangle degrees of freedom w.r.t. their action dependence. We further introduce a variational AIR architecture (VAIR) that can extract AIRs and therefore achieve provable disentanglement where standard VAEs fail. Beyond state representation, VAIR also captures the action dependence of the underlying generative factors, directly linking experiments to the degrees of freedom they influence.

Abstract: Recent advancements in zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) have facilitated the extraction of diverse behaviors from unlabeled, offline data sources. In particular, forward-backward algorithms (FB) can retrieve a family of policies that can approximately solve any standard RL problem (with additive rewards, linear in the occupancy measure), given sufficient capacity. While retaining zero-shot properties, we tackle the greater problem class of RL with general utilities, in which the objective is an arbitrary differentiable function of the occupancy measure. This setting is strictly more expressive, capturing tasks such as distribution matching or pure exploration, which may not be reduced to additive rewards. We show that this additional complexity can be captured by a novel, maximum entropy (soft) variant of the forward-backward algorithm, which recovers a family of stochastic policies from offline data. When coupled with zero-order search over compact policy embeddings, this algorithm can sidestep iterative optimization schemes, and optimizes general utilities directly at test-time. Across both didactic and high-dimensional experiments, we demonstrate that our method retains favorable properties of FB algorithms, while also extending their range to more general RL problems.

Abstract: Data augmentation can mitigate limited training data in machine-learning automated scoring engines for constructed response items. This study seeks to determine how well three approaches to large language model prompting produce essays that preserve the writing quality of the original essays and produce realistic text for augmenting ASE training datasets. We created simulated versions of student essays, and human raters assigned scores to them and rated the realism of the generated text. The results of the study indicate that the predict next prompting strategy produces the highest level of agreement between human raters regarding simulated essay scores, predict next and sentence strategies best preserve the rated quality of the original essay in the simulated essays, and predict next and 25 examples strategies produce the most realistic text as judged by human raters.

TL;DR: 本研究分析视觉Transformer（ViT）的可塑性——即组件输出随输入改变而适应的平均变化率，其与平滑性成反比。研究发现，关注模块和全连接层的高可塑性能够显著提升微调性能，这与传统观点中偏好平滑性的假设相悖。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管Transformer架构的平滑性已在泛化能力、训练稳定性和对抗性鲁棒性方面得到充分研究，但它在迁移学习中的作用仍不清楚。本文旨在通过分析ViT组件的可塑性（相对于输入的敏感度），为迁移学习中的组件选择提供依据。

Method: 作者从理论上定义并分析了可塑性（即输出对输入扰动的平均变化率，其反比于平滑性），并进行了大量实验，验证不同组件（如注意力模块、全连接层等）在微调过程中的可塑性对性能的影响。

Result: 理论分析和实验一致表明，注意力模块和全连接层具有较高的可塑性，且这种高可塑性使得在微调这些组件时能够取得更好的性能。这一发现与传统观点中“平滑性有利于学习”的假设相反。

Conclusion: 本研究提供了一个新的视角：在迁移学习中，组件的可塑性（而非平滑性）是更关键的属性。实践者应优先微调那些具有高可塑性的组件（如注意力模块和全连接层），以获得更优的微调效果。

Abstract: The smoothness of the transformer architecture has been extensively studied in the context of generalization, training stability, and adversarial robustness. However, its role in transfer learning remains poorly understood. In this paper, we analyze the ability of vision transformer components to adapt their outputs to changes in inputs, or, in other words, their plasticity. Defined as an average rate of change, it captures the sensitivity to input perturbation; in particular, a high plasticity implies low smoothness. We demonstrate through theoretical analysis and comprehensive experiments that this perspective provides principled guidance in choosing the components to prioritize during adaptation. A key takeaway for practitioners is that the high plasticity of the attention modules and feedforward layers consistently leads to better finetuning performance. Our findings depart from the prevailing assumption that smoothness is desirable, offering a novel perspective on the functional properties of transformers.

Abstract: Multicalibration gradient boosting has recently emerged as a scalable method that empirically produces approximately multicalibrated predictors and has been deployed at web scale. Despite this empirical success, its convergence properties are not well understood. In this paper, we bridge the gap by providing convergence guarantees for multicalibration gradient boosting in regression with squared-error loss. We show that the magnitude of successive prediction updates decays at $O(1/\sqrt{T})$, which implies the same convergence rate bound for the multicalibration error over rounds. Under additional smoothness assumptions on the weak learners, this rate improves to linear convergence. We further analyze adaptive variants, showing local quadratic convergence of the training loss, and we study rescaling schemes that preserve convergence. Experiments on real-world datasets support our theory and clarify the regimes in which the method achieves fast convergence and strong multicalibration.

Abstract: We study the problem of learning robust classifiers where the classifier will receive a perturbed input. Unlike robust PAC learning studied in prior work, here the clean data and its label are also adversarially chosen. We formulate this setting as an online learning problem and consider both the realizable and agnostic learnability of hypothesis classes. We define a new dimension of classes and show it controls the mistake bounds in the realizable setting and the regret bounds in the agnostic setting. In contrast to the dimension that characterizes learnability in the PAC setting, our dimension is rather simple and resembles the Littlestone dimension. We generalize our dimension to multiclass hypothesis classes and prove similar results in the realizable case. Finally, we study the case where the learner does not know the set of allowed perturbations for each point and only has some prior on them.

Abstract: DPO and related algorithms align language models by directly optimizing the RLHF objective: find a policy that maximizes the Bradley-Terry reward while staying close to a reference policy through a KL divergence penalty. Previous work showed that this approach could be further generalized: the original problem remains tractable even if the KL divergence is replaced by a family of $f$-divergence with a convex generating function $f$. Our first contribution is to show that convexity of $f$ is not essential. Instead, we identify a more general condition, referred to as DPO-inducing, that precisely characterizes when the RLHF problem remains tractable. Our next contribution is to establish a second condition on $f$ that is necessary to prevent probability displacement, a known empirical phenomenon in which the probabilities of the winner and the loser responses approach zero. We refer to any $f$ that satisfies this condition as displacement-resistant. We finally focus on a specific DPO-inducing and displacement-resistant $f$, leading to our novel SquaredPO loss. Compared to DPO, this new loss offers stronger theoretical guarantees while performing competitively in practice.

Abstract: Being probabilistic models, during inference large language models (LLMs) display rare events: behaviour that is far from typical but highly significant. By definition all rare events are hard to see, but the enormous scale of LLM usage means that events completely unobserved during development are likely to become prominent in deployment. Here we present an end-to-end framework for the systematic analysis of rare events in LLMs. We provide a practical implementation spanning theory, efficient generation strategies, probability estimation and error analysis, which we illustrate with concrete examples. We outline extensions and applications to other models and contexts, highlighting the generality of the concepts and techniques presented here.

Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is a fundamental component of modern weather prediction, yet it remains a major computational bottleneck in machine learning (ML)-based forecasting pipelines due to reliance on traditional variational methods. Recent generative ML-based DA methods offer a promising alternative but typically require many sampling steps and suffer from error accumulation under long-horizon auto-regressive rollouts with cycling assimilation. We propose FlowDA, a low-latency weather-scale generative DA framework based on flow matching. FlowDA conditions on observations through a SetConv-based embedding and fine-tunes the Aurora foundation model to deliver accurate, efficient, and robust analyses. Experiments across observation rates decreasing from $3.9\%$ to $0.1\%$ demonstrate superior performance of FlowDA over strong baselines with similar tunable-parameter size. FlowDA further shows robustness to observational noise and stable performance in long-horizon auto-regressive cycling DA. Overall, FlowDA points to an efficient and scalable direction for data-driven DA.

Motivation: 表格异常检测面临挑战：表格数据特征异质性强，不同检测方法基于不同的异常模式假设，无法在所有数据集上保持一致优越性。需要一种通用的校准框架来提升现有方法的泛化能力

Method: 提出CTAD模型无关后处理框架：1)通过随机采样和K-means聚类构建正常数据的经验分布和结构分布；2)使用最优传输距离度量测试样本加入后对两个分布兼容性的干扰程度；3)正常样本干扰小，异常样本干扰大，从而获得校准信号

Conclusion: CTAD是一个有效、鲁棒且易于部署的表格异常检测校准框架，通过最优传输距离的数学性质保证异常样本获得更高校准分数，解决了不同检测器在异质表格数据上表现不一致的问题

Abstract: Tabular anomaly detection (TAD) remains challenging due to the heterogeneity of tabular data: features lack natural relationships, vary widely in distribution and scale, and exhibit diverse types. Consequently, each TAD method makes implicit assumptions about anomaly patterns that work well on some datasets but fail on others, and no method consistently outperforms across diverse scenarios. We present CTAD (Calibrating Tabular Anomaly Detection), a model-agnostic post-processing framework that enhances any existing TAD detector through sample-specific calibration. Our approach characterizes normal data via two complementary distributions, i.e., an empirical distribution from random sampling and a structural distribution from K-means centroids, and measures how adding a test sample disrupts their compatibility using Optimal Transport (OT) distance. Normal samples maintain low disruption while anomalies cause high disruption, providing a calibration signal to amplify detection. We prove that OT distance has a lower bound proportional to the test sample's distance from centroids, and establish that anomalies systematically receive higher calibration scores than normals in expectation, explaining why the method generalizes across datasets. Extensive experiments on 34 diverse tabular datasets with 7 representative detectors spanning all major TAD categories (density estimation, classification, reconstruction, and isolation-based methods) demonstrate that CTAD consistently improves performance with statistical significance. Remarkably, CTAD enhances even state-of-the-art deep learning methods and shows robust performance across diverse hyperparameter settings, requiring no additional tuning for practical deployment.

Conclusion: 基于锐度感知最小化的方法为混合建模提供了一种通用的正则化策略，能够促进科学模型和机器学习模型的协同工作，提高混合建模的实用性

Abstract: Hybrid modeling, the combination of machine learning models and scientific mathematical models, enables flexible and robust data-driven prediction with partial interpretability. However, effectively the scientific models may be ignored in prediction due to the flexibility of the machine learning model, making the idea of hybrid modeling pointless. Typically some regularization is applied to hybrid model learning to avoid such a failure case, but the formulation of the regularizer strongly depends on model architectures and domain knowledge. In this paper, we propose to focus on the flatness of loss minima in learning hybrid models, aiming to make the model as simple as possible. We employ the idea of sharpness-aware minimization and adapt it to the hybrid modeling setting. Numerical experiments show that the SAM-based method works well across different choices of models and datasets.

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative modeling on sequence data; however, the information-theoretic principles governing their reverse processes remain significantly less understood than those of their continuous counterparts. In this work, we bridge this gap by analyzing the reverse process dynamics through the lens of thermodynamic entropy production. We propose the entropy production rate as a rigorous proxy for quantifying information generation, deriving as a byproduct a bound on the Wasserstein distance between intermediate states and the data distribution. Leveraging these insights, we introduce two novel sampling schedules that are uniformly spaced with respect to their corresponding physics-inspired metrics: the Entropic Discrete Schedule (EDS), which is defined by maintaining a constant rate of information gain, and the Wasserstein Discrete Schedule (WDS), which is defined by taking equal steps in terms of the Wasserstein distance. We empirically demonstrate that our proposed schedules significantly outperform state-of-the-art strategies across diverse application domains, including synthetic data, music notation, vision and language modeling, consistently achieving superior performance at a lower computational budget.

Abstract: The loss function is crucial to machine learning, especially in supervised learning frameworks. It is a fundamental component that controls the behavior and general efficacy of learning algorithms. However, despite their widespread use, traditional loss functions have significant drawbacks when dealing with high-dimensional and outlier-sensitive datasets, which frequently results in reduced performance and slower convergence during training. In this work, we develop a robust, bounded, and smooth (RoBoS-NN) loss function to resolve the aforementioned hindrances. The generalization ability of the loss function has also been theoretically analyzed to rigorously justify its robustness. Moreover, we implement RoboS-NN loss in the framework of a neural network (NN) to forecast time series and present a new robust algorithm named $\mathcal{L}_{\text{RoBoS}}$-NN. To assess the potential of $\mathcal{L}_{\text{RoBoS}}$-NN, we conduct experiments on multiple real-world datasets. In addition, we infuse outliers into data sets to evaluate the performance of $\mathcal{L}_{\text{RoBoS}}$-NN in more challenging scenarios. Numerical results show that $\mathcal{L}_{\text{RoBoS}}$-NN outperforms the other benchmark models in terms of accuracy measures.

Abstract: Reliable short-term demand forecasting is essential for managing shared micro-mobility services and ensuring responsive, user-centered operations. This study introduces T-STAR (Two-stage Spatial and Temporal Adaptive contextual Representation), a novel transformer-based probabilistic framework designed to forecast station-level bike-sharing demand at a 15-minute resolution. T-STAR addresses key challenges in high-resolution forecasting by disentangling consistent demand patterns from short-term fluctuations through a hierarchical two-stage structure. The first stage captures coarse-grained hourly demand patterns, while the second stage improves prediction accuracy by incorporating high-frequency, localized inputs, including recent fluctuations and real-time demand variations in connected metro services, to account for temporal shifts in short-term demand. Time series transformer models are employed in both stages to generate probabilistic predictions. Extensive experiments using Washington D.C.'s Capital Bikeshare data demonstrate that T-STAR outperforms existing methods in both deterministic and probabilistic accuracy. The model exhibits strong spatial and temporal robustness across stations and time periods. A zero-shot forecasting experiment further highlights T-STAR's ability to transfer to previously unseen service areas without retraining. These results underscore the framework's potential to deliver granular, reliable, and uncertainty-aware short-term demand forecasts, which enable seamless integration to support multimodal trip planning for travelers and enhance real-time operations in shared micro-mobility services.

Abstract: Adaptive methods like Adam have become the $\textit{de facto}$ standard for large-scale vector and Euclidean optimization due to their coordinate-wise adaptation with a second-order nature. More recently, matrix-based spectral optimizers like Muon (Jordan et al., 2024b) show the power of treating weight matrices as matrices rather than long vectors. Linking these is hard because many natural generalizations are not feasible to implement, and we also cannot simply move the Adam adaptation to the matrix spectrum. To address this, we reformulate the AdaGrad update and decompose it into a variance adaptation term and a scale-invariant term. This decoupling produces $\textbf{DeVA}$ ($\textbf{De}$coupled $\textbf{V}$ariance $\textbf{A}$daptation), a framework that bridges between vector-based variance adaptation and matrix spectral optimization, enabling a seamless transition from Adam to adaptive spectral descent. Extensive experiments across language modeling and image classification demonstrate that DeVA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as Muon and SOAP (Vyas et al., 2024), reducing token usage by around 6.6\%. Theoretically, we show that the variance adaptation term effectively improves the blockwise smoothness, facilitating faster convergence.

Abstract: Image-based patient-specific simulation of left ventricular (LV) mechanics is valuable for understanding cardiac function and supporting clinical intervention planning, but conventional finite-element analysis (FEA) is computationally intensive. Current graph-based surrogates do not have full-cycle prediction capabilities, and physics-informed neural networks often struggle to converge on complex cardiac geometries. We present CardioGraphFENet (CGFENet), a unified graph-based surrogate for rapid full-cycle estimation of LV myocardial biomechanics, supervised by a large FEA simulation dataset. The proposed model integrates (i) a global--local graph encoder to capture mesh features with weak-form-inspired global coupling, (ii) a gated recurrent unit-based temporal encoder conditioned on the target volume-time signal to model cycle-coherent dynamics, and (iii) a cycle-consistent bidirectional formulation for both loading and inverse unloading within a single framework. These strategies enable high fidelity with respect to traditional FEA ground truths and produce physiologically plausible pressure-volume loops that match FEA results when coupled with a lumped-parameter model. In particular, the cycle-consistency strategy enables a significant reduction in FEA supervision with only minimal loss in accuracy.

Abstract: Recovering a unique causal graph from observational data is an ill-posed problem because multiple generating mechanisms can lead to the same observational distribution. This problem becomes solvable only by exploiting specific structural or distributional assumptions. While recent work has separately utilized time-series dynamics or multi-environment heterogeneity to constrain this problem, we integrate both as complementary sources of heterogeneity. This integration yields unified necessary identifiability conditions and enables a rigorous analysis of the statistical limits of recovery under thin versus heavy-tailed noise. In particular, temporal structure is shown to effectively substitute for missing environmental diversity, possibly achieving identifiability even under insufficient heterogeneity. Extending this analysis to heavy-tailed (Student's t) distributions, we demonstrate that while geometric identifiability conditions remain invariant, the sample complexity diverges significantly from the Gaussian baseline. Explicit information-theoretic bounds quantify this cost of robustness, establishing the fundamental limits of covariance-based causal graph recovery methods in realistic non-stationary systems. This work shifts the focus from whether causal structure is identifiable to whether it is statistically recoverable in practice.

Motivation: 传统的OCO研究通常假设移动成本为零或固定，但在许多实际应用中（如延迟反馈、时变记忆问题），移动成本会随时间变化。这推动我们研究更一般的带有时变移动成本的OCO问题，以更贴合现实场景

Conclusion: 本研究不仅将带移动成本的OCO扩展到时变系数情形，还通过将延迟反馈和时变记忆问题转化为统一框架，展示了该方法的广泛适用性，为解决其他自适应学习问题提供了新思路


Abstract: In this paper, we study dynamic regret in unconstrained online convex optimization (OCO) with movement costs. Specifically, we generalize the standard setting by allowing the movement cost coefficients $λ_t$ to vary arbitrarily over time. Our main contribution is a novel algorithm that establishes the first comparator-adaptive dynamic regret bound for this setting, guaranteeing $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{(1+P_T)(T+\sum_t λ_t)})$ regret, where $P_T$ is the path length of the comparator sequence over $T$ rounds. This recovers the optimal guarantees for both static and dynamic regret in standard OCO as a special case where $λ_t=0$ for all rounds. To demonstrate the versatility of our results, we consider two applications: OCO with delayed feedback and OCO with time-varying memory. We show that both problems can be translated into time-varying movement costs, establishing a novel reduction specifically for the delayed feedback setting that is of independent interest. A crucial observation is that the first-order dependence on movement costs in our regret bound plays a key role in enabling optimal comparator-adaptive dynamic regret guarantees in both settings.

Abstract: Background: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a powerful tool to investigate neurophysiology of the human brain and treat brain disorders. Traditionally, therapeutic TMS has been applied in a one-size-fits-all approach, disregarding inter- and intra-individual differences. Brain state-dependent EEG-TMS, such as coupling TMS with a pre-specified phase of the sensorimotor mu-rhythm, enables the induction of differential neuroplastic effects depending on the targeted phase. But this approach is still user-dependent as it requires defining an a-priori target phase. Objectives: To present a first realization of a machine-learning-based, closed-loop real-time EEG-TMS setup to identify user-independently the individual mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low-corticospinal excitability states. Methods: We applied EEG-TMS to 25 participants targeting the supplementary motor area-primary motor cortex network and used a reinforcement learning algorithm to identify the mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low corticospinal excitability. We employed linear mixed effects models and Bayesian analysis to determine effects of reinforced learning on corticospinal excitability indexed by motor evoked potential amplitude, and functional connectivity indexed by the imaginary part of resting-state EEG coherence. Results: Reinforcement learning effectively identified the mu-rhythm phase associated with high- vs. low-excitability states, and their repetitive stimulation resulted in long-term increases vs. decreases in functional connectivity in the stimulated sensorimotor network. Conclusions: We demonstrated for the first time the feasibility of closed-loop EEG-TMS in humans, a critical step towards individualized treatment of brain disorders.

Abstract: The recent surge in Time Series Foundation Models has rapidly advanced the field, yet the heterogeneous training setups across studies make it difficult to attribute improvements to architectural innovations versus data engineering. In this work, we investigate the potential of a standard patch Transformer, demonstrating that this generic architecture achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot forecasting performance using a straightforward training protocol. We conduct a comprehensive ablation study that covers model scaling, data composition, and training techniques to isolate the essential ingredients for high performance. Our findings identify the key drivers of performance, while confirming that the generic architecture itself demonstrates excellent scalability. By strictly controlling these variables, we provide comprehensive empirical results on model scaling across multiple dimensions. We release our open-source model and detailed findings to establish a transparent, reproducible baseline for future research.

Abstract: We study off-policy reinforcement learning for controlling continuous-time Markov diffusion processes with discrete-time observations and actions. We consider model-free algorithms with function approximation that learn value and advantage functions directly from data, without unrealistic structural assumptions on the dynamics.
  Leveraging the ellipticity of the diffusions, we establish a new class of Hilbert-space positive definiteness and boundedness properties for the Bellman operators. Based on these properties, we propose the Sobolev-prox fitted $q$-learning algorithm, which learns value and advantage functions by iteratively solving least-squares regression problems. We derive oracle inequalities for the estimation error, governed by (i) the best approximation error of the function classes, (ii) their localized complexity, (iii) exponentially decaying optimization error, and (iv) numerical discretization error. These results identify ellipticity as a key structural property that renders reinforcement learning with function approximation for Markov diffusions no harder than supervised learning.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了Aurora系统，通过在线学习解决推测解码应用中训练与服务分离导致的延迟问题，实现即时部署和动态适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的推测解码将训练与推理服务分离，导致三大问题：部署滞后时间长、端到端加速效果反馈延迟、以及领域漂移导致性能下降。需要一种能闭环学习的在线系统来克服这些限制。

Method: 提出Aurora统一训练-服务系统，将在线推测器学习重构为异步强化学习问题：接受token提供正向反馈，拒绝提议提供隐式负反馈以提高样本效率。系统整合SGLang推理服务器和异步训练服务器，支持热插拔更新且服务不中断。

Result: Aurora能够在发布首日就获得1.5倍加速（如MiniMax M2.1 229B和Qwen3-Coder-Next 80B等前沿模型），并有效适应用户流量分布变化，在Qwen3和Llama3等常用模型上比静态推测器额外提升1.25倍速度。

Conclusion: Aurora通过统一的端到端训练-服务框架解决了推测解码的部署滞后问题，实现了即时部署和持续优化，显著提升了LLM服务效率并适应动态环境变化。

Abstract: Speculative decoding can significantly accelerate LLM serving, yet most deployments today disentangle speculator training from serving, treating speculator training as a standalone offline modeling problem. We show that this decoupled formulation introduces substantial deployment and adaptation lag: (1) high time-to-serve, since a speculator must be trained offline for a considerable period before deployment; (2) delayed utility feedback, since the true end-to-end decoding speedup is only known after training and cannot be inferred reliably from acceptance rate alone due to model-architecture and system-level overheads; and (3) domain-drift degradation, as the target model is repurposed to new domains and the speculator becomes stale and less effective.
  To address these issues, we present Aurora, a unified training-serving system that closes the loop by continuously learning a speculator directly from live inference traces. Aurora reframes online speculator learning as an asynchronous reinforcement-learning problem: accepted tokens provide positive feedback, while rejected speculator proposals provide implicit negative feedback that we exploit to improve sample efficiency. Our design integrates an SGLang-based inference server with an asynchronous training server, enabling hot-swapped speculator updates without service interruption. Crucially, Aurora supports day-0 deployment: a speculator can be served immediately and rapidly adapted to live traffic, improving system performance while providing immediate utility feedback. Across experiments, Aurora achieves a 1.5x day-0 speedup on recently released frontier models (e.g., MiniMax M2.1 229B and Qwen3-Coder-Next 80B). Aurora also adapts effectively to distribution shifts in user traffic, delivering an additional 1.25x speedup over a well-trained but static speculator on widely used models (e.g., Qwen3 and Llama3).

Abstract: Learning unsupervised representations that are both semantically meaningful and stable across runs remains a central challenge in modern representation learning. We introduce entropy-ordered flows (EOFlows), a normalizing-flow framework that orders latent dimensions by their explained entropy, analogously to PCA's explained variance. This ordering enables adaptive injective flows: after training, one may retain only the top C latent variables to form a compact core representation while the remaining variables capture fine-grained detail and noise, with C chosen flexibly at inference time rather than fixed during training. EOFlows build on insights from Independent Mechanism Analysis, Principal Component Flows and Manifold Entropic Metrics. We combine likelihood-based training with local Jacobian regularization and noise augmentation into a method that scales well to high-dimensional data such as images. Experiments on the CelebA dataset show that our method uncovers a rich set of semantically interpretable features, allowing for high compression and strong denoising.

Abstract: Addressing class imbalance is a central challenge in credit card fraud detection, as it directly impacts predictive reliability in real-world financial systems. To overcome this, the study proposes an enhanced workflow based on the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM)-a transparent, state-of-the-art implementation of the GA2M algorithm-optimized through systematic hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and preprocessing refinement. Rather than relying on conventional sampling techniques that may introduce bias or cause information loss, the optimized EBM achieves an effective balance between accuracy and interpretability, enabling precise detection of fraudulent transactions while providing actionable insights into feature importance and interaction effects. Furthermore, the Taguchi method is employed to optimize both the sequence of data scalers and model hyperparameters, ensuring robust, reproducible, and systematically validated performance improvements. Experimental evaluation on benchmark credit card data yields an ROC-AUC of 0.983, surpassing prior EBM baselines (0.975) and outperforming Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree models. These results highlight the potential of interpretable machine learning and data-driven optimization for advancing trustworthy fraud analytics in financial systems.
