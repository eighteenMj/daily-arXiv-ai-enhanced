Abstract: In the quest for fairness in artificial intelligence, novel approaches to enhance it in facial image based gender classification algorithms using text guided methodologies are presented. The core methodology involves leveraging semantic information from image captions during model training to improve generalization capabilities. Two key strategies are presented: Image Text Matching (ITM) guidance and Image Text fusion. ITM guidance trains the model to discern fine grained alignments between images and texts to obtain enhanced multimodal representations. Image text fusion combines both modalities into comprehensive representations for improved fairness. Exensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate these approaches effectively mitigate bias and improve accuracy across gender racial groups compared to existing methods. Additionally, the unique integration of textual guidance underscores an interpretable and intuitive training paradigm for computer vision systems. By scrutinizing the extent to which semantic information reduces disparities, this research offers valuable insights into cultivating more equitable facial analysis algorithms. The proposed methodologies contribute to addressing the pivotal challenge of demographic bias in gender classification from facial images. Furthermore, this technique operates in the absence of demographic labels and is application agnostic.

Specifically, our contributions are threefold: (i) we present SoccerMaster, the first soccer-specific vision foundation model that unifies diverse understanding tasks within a single framework via supervised multi-task pretraining; (ii) we develop an automated data curation pipeline to generate scalable spatial annotations, and integrate them with various existing soccer video datasets to construct SoccerFactory, a comprehensive pretraining data resource; and (iii) we conduct extensive evaluations demonstrating that SoccerMaster consistently outperforms task-specific expert models across diverse downstream tasks, highlighting its breadth and superiority. The data, code, and model will be publicly available.

*Marshal Ashif Shawkat,Moidul Hasan,Taufiq Hasan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种利用知识蒸馏技术在无边界框标注情况下训练CNN模型的方法，以降低肺结核分类中的虚假相关性并定位异常。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肺结核在全球特别是资源有限国家仍是主要死因之一。虽然胸透是经济有效的诊断工具，但需专家解读且常不可得。现有机器学习模型常依赖虚假相关性且泛化能力不足，同时医学图像的高质量标注数据集构建成本高昂。

Method: 通过ResNet50架构的师生框架知识蒸馏技术，在无需边界框标注的情况下训练CNN模型，用于降低虚假相关性并定位肺结核相关异常。

Result: 在TBX11k数据集上训练的方法取得了0.2428 mIOU分数，学生模型表现持续优于教师模型，显示出更好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法减少了对标注的依赖，提高了模型鲁棒性，具有在多样化临床环境中更广泛部署的潜力。

Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide, particularly in resource-limited countries. Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging serves as an accessible and cost-effective diagnostic tool but requires expert interpretation, which is often unavailable. Although machine learning models have shown high performance in TB classification, they often depend on spurious correlations and fail to generalize. Besides, building large datasets featuring high-quality annotations for medical images demands substantial resources and input from domain specialists, and typically involves several annotators reaching agreement, which results in enormous financial and logistical expenses. This study repurposes knowledge distillation technique to train CNN models reducing spurious correlations and localize TB-related abnormalities without requiring bounding-box annotations. By leveraging a teacher-student framework with ResNet50 architecture, the proposed method trained on TBX11k dataset achieve impressive 0.2428 mIOU score. Experimental results further reveal that the student model consistently outperforms the teacher, underscoring improved robustness and potential for broader clinical deployment in diverse settings.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising path toward interpretable medical diagnosis by allowing users to ask about clinical explanations alongside predictions and across different modalities. However, training VLMs for detailed reasoning requires large-scale image-text datasets. In many specialized domains, for example in reading Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) images, such precise text with grounded description of pathologies is scarce or even non-existent. To overcome this bottleneck, we introduce Synthetic Vasculature Reasoning (SVR), a framework that controllably synthesizes images and corresponding text, specifically: realistic retinal vasculature with Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) features: capillary dropout, microaneurysms, neovascularization, and tortuosity, while automatically generating granular reasoning texts. Based on this we curate OCTA-100K-SVR, an OCTA image-reasoning dataset with 100,000 pairs. Our experiments show that a general-purpose VLM (Qwen3-VL-8b) trained on the dataset achieves a zero-shot balanced classification accuracy of 89.67% on real OCTA images, outperforming supervised baselines. Through human expert evaluation we also demonstrate that it significantly enhances explanation quality and pathology localization on clinical data.

  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Understanding human movement and city dynamics has always been challenging. From traditional methods of manually observing the city's inhabitant, to using cameras, to now using sensors and more complex technology, the field of urban monitoring has evolved greatly. Still, there are more that can be done to unlock better practices for understanding city dynamics. This paper surveys how the landscape of urban dynamics studying has evolved with a particular focus on event-based cameras. Event-based cameras capture changes in light intensity instead of the RGB values that traditional cameras do. They offer unique abilities, like the ability to work in low-light, that can make them advantageous compared to other sensors. Through an analysis of event-based cameras, their applications, their advantages and challenges, and machine learning applications, we propose event-based cameras as a medium for capturing information to study urban dynamics. They offer the ability to capture important information while maintaining privacy. We also suggest multi-sensor fusion of event-based cameras and other sensors in the study of urban dynamics. Combining event-based cameras and infrared, event-LiDAR, or vibration has to potential to enhance the ability of event-based cameras and overcome the challenges that event-based cameras have.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Pre-trained image restoration models often fail on real-world, out-of-distribution degradations due to significant domain gaps. Adapting to these unseen domains is challenging, as out-of-distribution data lacks ground truth, and traditional adaptation methods often require complex architectural changes. We propose LEGO (Learning from a Generative Oracle), a practical three-stage framework for post-training domain adaptation without paired data. LEGO converts this unsupervised challenge into a tractable pseudo-supervised one. First, we obtain initial restorations from the pre-trained model. Second, we leverage a frozen, large-scale generative oracle to refine these estimates into high-quality pseudo-ground-truths. Third, we fine-tune the original model using a mixed-supervision strategy combining in-distribution data with these new pseudo-pairs. This approach adapts the model to the new distribution without sacrificing its original robustness or requiring architectural modifications. Experiments demonstrate that LEGO effectively bridges the domain gap, significantly improving performance on diverse real-world benchmarks.

### [7] [Vision-Language Models for Infrared Industrial Sensing in Additive Manufacturing Scene Description](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11098)
*Nazanin Mahjourian,Vinh Nguyen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了VLM-IRIS，一种零样本框架，通过预处理红外图像为RGB兼容格式，将视觉语言模型适配于红外数据，实现了无需重新训练的红外图像零样本工件检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多制造环境在低光照或封闭机器中运行，传统视觉系统难以应对；红外相机在此类环境中有优势。同时，监督AI系统需要大量标注数据，而零样本学习框架更实用。现有视觉语言模型无法理解红外数据，因为它们只在RGB数据上训练。

Method: 开发VLM-IRIS框架，使用FLIR Boson传感器捕获红外图像，通过预处理转换成岩浆表示格式，使其适合CLIP编码器。采用质心提示集成技术，结合CLIP ViT-B/32编码器进行零样本预测。

Result: 在3D打印机床上实现了零样本工件存在检测，利用构建板和工件之间的温差特性，通过热成像技术实现了高精度检测。

Conclusion: 所提出的VLM改进可以有效地扩展到热成像应用，实现无需标注的监控，为工业红外传感提供了实用的零样本解决方案。

Abstract: Many manufacturing environments operate in low-light conditions or within enclosed machines where conventional vision systems struggle. Infrared cameras provide complementary advantages in such environments. Simultaneously, supervised AI systems require large labeled datasets, which makes zero-shot learning frameworks more practical for applications including infrared cameras. Recent advances in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) offer a new path in zero-shot predictions from paired image-text representations. However, current VLMs cannot understand infrared camera data since they are trained on RGB data. This work introduces VLM-IRIS (Vision-Language Models for InfraRed Industrial Sensing), a zero-shot framework that adapts VLMs to infrared data by preprocessing infrared images captured by a FLIR Boson sensor into RGB-compatible inputs suitable for CLIP-based encoders. We demonstrate zero-shot workpiece presence detection on a 3D printer bed where temperature differences between the build plate and workpieces make the task well-suited for thermal imaging. VLM-IRIS converts the infrared images to magma representation and applies centroid prompt ensembling with a CLIP ViT-B/32 encoder to achieve high accuracy on infrared images without any model retraining. These findings demonstrate that the proposed improvements to VLMs can be effectively extended to thermal applications for label-free monitoring.

TL;DR: 本文提出了EditMGT，首个基于Masked Generative Transformers (MGTs)的图像编辑框架，通过局部化解码范式和区域控制采样实现精确的局部编辑，在保持相似性性能的同时实现6倍加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像编辑中虽然视觉质量优异，但其全局去噪动态会将局部编辑目标与全图上下文混合，导致非目标区域被意外修改。本研究转向Masked Generative Transformers作为替代方案，利用其局部化解码特性来保留非相关区域。

Method: 1) 利用MGT的交叉注意力图提供定位信号并设计多层注意力整合方案实现细粒度定位；2) 提出区域保持采样，限制注意力区域的令牌翻转以抑制虚假编辑；3) 构建CrispEdit-2M高分辨率数据集；4) 通过注意力注入将预训练的文本到图像MGT适配为图像编辑模型，无需引入额外参数。

Result: 在四个标准基准测试中：1) 参数量少于10亿；2) 保持相似性性能同时实现6倍编辑加速；3) 在风格变更和风格迁移任务上分别提升3.6%和17.6%的编辑质量；4) 提供可比较或更优的编辑质量。

Conclusion: EditMGT框架成功地将MGTs应用于图像编辑，通过局部化特性和区域控制采样解决了扩散模型在局部编辑中的局限，实现了高效、高质量的视觉编辑，为图像编辑方法提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models (DMs) have achieved exceptional visual quality in image editing tasks. However, the global denoising dynamics of DMs inherently conflate local editing targets with the full-image context, leading to unintended modifications in non-target regions. In this paper, we shift our attention beyond DMs and turn to Masked Generative Transformers (MGTs) as an alternative approach to tackle this challenge. By predicting multiple masked tokens rather than holistic refinement, MGTs exhibit a localized decoding paradigm that endows them with the inherent capacity to explicitly preserve non-relevant regions during the editing process. Building upon this insight, we introduce the first MGT-based image editing framework, termed EditMGT. We first demonstrate that MGT's cross-attention maps provide informative localization signals for localizing edit-relevant regions and devise a multi-layer attention consolidation scheme that refines these maps to achieve fine-grained and precise localization. On top of these adaptive localization results, we introduce region-hold sampling, which restricts token flipping within low-attention areas to suppress spurious edits, thereby confining modifications to the intended target regions and preserving the integrity of surrounding non-target areas. To train EditMGT, we construct CrispEdit-2M, a high-resolution dataset spanning seven diverse editing categories. Without introducing additional parameters, we adapt a pre-trained text-to-image MGT into an image editing model through attention injection. Extensive experiments across four standard benchmarks demonstrate that, with fewer than 1B parameters, our model achieves similarity performance while enabling 6 times faster editing. Moreover, it delivers comparable or superior editing quality, with improvements of 3.6% and 17.6% on style change and style transfer tasks, respectively.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Current visual grounding models are either based on a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that performs auto-regressive decoding, which is slow and risks hallucinations, or on re-aligning an LLM with vision features to learn new special or object tokens for grounding, which may undermine the LLM's pretrained reasoning ability. In contrast, we propose VGent, a modular encoder-decoder architecture that explicitly disentangles high-level reasoning and low-level bounding box prediction. Specifically, a frozen MLLM serves as the encoder to provide untouched powerful reasoning capabilities, while a decoder takes high-quality boxes proposed by detectors as queries and selects target box(es) via cross-attending on encoder's hidden states. This design fully leverages advances in both object detection and MLLM, avoids the pitfalls of auto-regressive decoding, and enables fast inference. Moreover, it supports modular upgrades of both the encoder and decoder to benefit the whole system: we introduce (i) QuadThinker, an RL-based training paradigm for enhancing multi-target reasoning ability of the encoder; (ii) mask-aware label for resolving detection-segmentation ambiguity; and (iii) global target recognition to improve the recognition of all the targets which benefits the selection among augmented proposals. Experiments on multi-target visual grounding benchmarks show that VGent achieves a new state-of-the-art with +20.6% F1 improvement over prior methods, and further boosts gIoU by +8.2% and cIoU by +5.8% under visual reference challenges, while maintaining constant, fast inference latency.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于信息驱动的智能融合策略，将多个病理基础模型（FMs）整合为统一表示，用于肾、前列腺和直肠癌的分级和分期任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然各种病理基础模型在预训练目标上存在相似性，但对它们的互补性、嵌入空间冗余度以及特征的生物学解释仍了解有限。需要一种系统方法来整合多个FMs，提高癌症诊断任务的预测性能和可解释性。

Method: 1. 使用肾癌（519张切片）、前列腺癌（490张切片）和直肠癌（200张切片）的H&E全切片图像，分为低/高等级或分期
2. 考虑图块级（Conch v1.5, MUSK, Virchow2, H-Optimus1, Prov-Gigapath）和切片级（TITAN, CHIEF, MADELEINE）基础模型
3. 评估三种融合策略：多数投票集成、朴素特征拼接、基于相关性引导剪枝冗余特征的智能融合
4. 采用患者分层交叉验证和保留测试策略

Result: 1. 智能融合在所有三种癌症上均取得一致性能提升，优于最佳单个FM和朴素融合
2. 全局相似性度量显示FM嵌入空间高度对齐，但局部邻域一致性较低，表明FMs提供互补的细粒度信息
3. 注意力图显示智能融合能集中关注肿瘤区域，减少对良性区域的虚假焦点

Conclusion: 基于相关性引导的智能融合策略能够生成紧凑、任务定制的表示，在计算病理学下游任务中同时提升预测性能和可解释性，为整合多个病理基础模型提供有效框架。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) have demonstrated strong performance across diverse pathology tasks. While there are similarities in the pre-training objectives of FMs, there is still limited understanding of their complementarity, redundancy in embedding spaces, or biological interpretation of features. In this study, we propose an information-driven, intelligent fusion strategy for integrating multiple pathology FMs into a unified representation and systematically evaluate its performance for cancer grading and staging across three distinct diseases. Diagnostic H&E whole-slide images from kidney (519 slides), prostate (490 slides), and rectal (200 slides) cancers were dichotomized into low versus high grade or stage. Both tile-level FMs (Conch v1.5, MUSK, Virchow2, H-Optimus1, Prov-Gigapath) and slide-level FMs (TITAN, CHIEF, MADELEINE) were considered to train downstream classifiers. We then evaluated three FM fusion schemes at both tile and slide levels: majority-vote ensembling, naive feature concatenation, and intelligent fusion based on correlation-guided pruning of redundant features. Under patient-stratified cross-validation with hold-out testing, intelligent fusion of tile-level embeddings yielded consistent gains in classification performance across all three cancers compared with the best single FMs and naive fusion. Global similarity metrics revealed substantial alignment of FM embedding spaces, contrasted by lower local neighborhood agreement, indicating complementary fine-grained information across FMs. Attention maps showed that intelligent fusion yielded concentrated attention on tumor regions while reducing spurious focus on benign regions. Our findings suggest that intelligent, correlation-guided fusion of pathology FMs can yield compact, task-tailored representations that enhance both predictive performance and interpretability in downstream computational pathology tasks.

Abstract: Stereo foundation models achieve strong zero-shot generalization but remain computationally prohibitive for real-time applications. Efficient stereo architectures, on the other hand, sacrifice robustness for speed and require costly per-domain fine-tuning. To bridge this gap, we present Fast-FoundationStereo, a family of architectures that achieve, for the first time, strong zero-shot generalization at real-time frame rate. We employ a divide-and-conquer acceleration strategy with three components: (1) knowledge distillation to compress the hybrid backbone into a single efficient student; (2) blockwise neural architecture search for automatically discovering optimal cost filtering designs under latency budgets, reducing search complexity exponentially; and (3) structured pruning for eliminating redundancy in the iterative refinement module. Furthermore, we introduce an automatic pseudo-labeling pipeline used to curate 1.4M in-the-wild stereo pairs to supplement synthetic training data and facilitate knowledge distillation. The resulting model can run over 10x faster than FoundationStereo while closely matching its zero-shot accuracy, thus establishing a new state-of-the-art among real-time methods.

TL;DR: ItemizedCLIP 是一个针对图像中独立标注文本项训练视觉模型的新框架。它在多类医学影像和遥感数据中表现出优于基线的零样本性能和解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多视觉领域（如医学影像、遥感）包含『项目化文本标注』——即单张图像中有多个描述独立语义项的文本。这种监督方式与标准的多标题监督（标题冗余或高度重叠）不同，现有方法难以处理这种独立的项目化文本监督。

Method: ItemizedCLIP 使用跨注意力模块生成基于文本项的视觉嵌入，并设计了一系列定制目标函数，共同强制实现项独立性（不同项对应不同区域）和表示完整性（覆盖所有项）。

Result: 在四个自然具有项目化文本监督的领域（脑 MRI、头部 CT、胸部 CT、遥感）以及一个合成的项目化数据集上，ItemizedCLIP 在零样本性能和细粒度可解释性方面相比基线模型均有显著提升。

Conclusion: ItemizedCLIP 学到的视觉表示具有语义基础、项可区分性、完整性以及视觉可解释性，适用于需要处理多个独立语义项的视觉领域。

Abstract: Training vision models with language supervision enables general and transferable representations. However, many visual domains, especially non-object-centric domains such as medical imaging and remote sensing, contain itemized text annotations: multiple text items describing distinct and semantically independent findings within a single image. Such supervision differs from standard multi-caption supervision, where captions are redundant or highly overlapping. Here, we introduce ItemizedCLIP, a framework for learning complete and explainable visual representations from itemized text supervision. ItemizedCLIP employs a cross-attention module to produce text item-conditioned visual embeddings and a set of tailored objectives that jointly enforce item independence (distinct regions for distinct items) and representation completeness (coverage of all items). Across four domains with naturally itemized text supervision (brain MRI, head CT, chest CT, remote sensing) and one additional synthetically itemized dataset, ItemizedCLIP achieves substantial improvements in zero-shot performance and fine-grained interpretability over baselines. The resulting ItemizedCLIP representations are semantically grounded, item-differentiable, complete, and visually interpretable. Our code is available at https://github.com/MLNeurosurg/ItemizedCLIP.

Conclusion: 圖像分割是處理高分辨率圖像的有效策略，但實際應用中需考慮任務類型、分割粒度及全局上下文的影響。這項研究為未來高分辨率多模態模型設計提供了重要參考。

Abstract: Reproducibility remains a cornerstone of scientific progress, yet complex multimodal models often lack transparent implementation details and accessible training infrastructure. In this work, we present a detailed reproduction and critical analysis of the Monkey Vision-Language Model (VLM) (Li et al. 2023b) published in CVPR24, a recent approach to high-resolution image understanding via image tiling. The original paper proposed splitting large images into tiles to recover fine-grained visual details while maintaining computational efficiency. Our study replicates this strategy using open checkpoints and reimplements the training pipeline. We confirm the key finding of the original Monkey VLM work, namely that tiling effectively recovers local details. We then extend this work further, by investigating the effect of the inclusion of the global context, which provide practical insights for future high-resolution multimodal modeling. However, we also report deviations in the results, with the magnitude of these effects depending heavily on task type and tile granularity.

TL;DR: LGSCV提出了一种基于视频编解码器的轻量级3D高斯喷溅压缩方法，通过两阶段Morton扫描生成块状2D图，结合PCA降维和快速MiniPLAS实现高质量压缩，在保持高效率的同时显著提升率失真性能。

Conclusion: LGSCV通过结合块状映射、PCA降维和局部优化排序，实现了高效轻量的3D高斯喷溅压缩，显著提升了压缩效率和速度，适合轻量设备部署。

Abstract: Current video-based GS compression methods rely on using Parallel Linear Assignment Sorting (PLAS) to convert 3D GS into smooth 2D maps, which are computationally expensive and time-consuming, limiting the application of GS on lightweight devices. In this paper, we propose a Lightweight 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) Compression method based on Video codec (LGSCV). First, a two-stage Morton scan is proposed to generate blockwise 2D maps that are friendly for canonical video codecs in which the coding units (CU) are square blocks. A 3D Morton scan is used to permute GS primitives, followed by a 2D Morton scan to map the ordered GS primitives to 2D maps in a blockwise style. However, although the blockwise 2D maps report close performance to the PLAS map in high-bitrate regions, they show a quality collapse at medium-to-low bitrates. Therefore, a principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of spherical harmonics (SH), and a MiniPLAS, which is flexible and fast, is designed to permute the primitives within certain block sizes. Incorporating SH PCA and MiniPLAS leads to a significant gain in rate-distortion (RD) performance, especially at medium and low bitrates. MiniPLAS can also guide the setting of the codec CU size configuration and significantly reduce encoding time. Experimental results on the MPEG dataset demonstrate that the proposed LGSCV achieves over 20% RD gain compared with state-of-the-art methods, while reducing 2D map generation time to approximately 1 second and cutting encoding time by 50%.

Abstract: Crafting computer-aided design (CAD) models has long been a painstaking and time-intensive task, demanding both precision and expertise from designers. With the emergence of 3D generation, this task has undergone a transformative impact, shifting not only from visual fidelity to functional utility but also enabling editable CAD designs. Prior works have achieved early success in single-part CAD generation, which is not well-suited for real-world applications, as multiple parts need to be assembled under semantic and geometric constraints. In this paper, we propose CADKnitter, a compositional CAD generation framework with a geometry-guided diffusion sampling strategy. CADKnitter is able to generate a complementary CAD part that follows both the geometric constraints of the given CAD model and the semantic constraints of the desired design text prompt. We also curate a dataset, so-called KnitCAD, containing over 310,000 samples of CAD models, along with textual prompts and assembly metadata that provide semantic and geometric constraints. Intensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art baselines by a clear margin.

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models (AR-VDMs) show strong promise as scalable alternatives to bidirectional VDMs, enabling real-time and interactive applications. Yet there remains room for improvement in their sample fidelity. A promising solution is inference-time alignment, which optimizes the noise space to improve sample fidelity without updating model parameters. Yet, optimization- or search-based methods are computationally impractical for AR-VDMs. Recent text-to-image (T2I) works address this via feedforward noise refiners that modulate sampled noises in a single forward pass. Can such noise refiners be extended to AR-VDMs? We identify the failure of naively extending T2I noise refiners to AR-VDMs and propose AutoRefiner-a noise refiner tailored for AR-VDMs, with two key designs: pathwise noise refinement and a reflective KV-cache. Experiments demonstrate that AutoRefiner serves as an efficient plug-in for AR-VDMs, effectively enhancing sample fidelity by refining noise along stochastic denoising paths.

Abstract: Wildfire smoke is transparent, amorphous, and often visually confounded with clouds, making early-stage detection particularly challenging. In this work, we introduce a benchmark, called SmokeBench, to evaluate the ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to recognize and localize wildfire smoke in images. The benchmark consists of four tasks: (1) smoke classification, (2) tile-based smoke localization, (3) grid-based smoke localization, and (4) smoke detection. We evaluate several MLLMs, including Idefics2, Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL3, Unified-IO 2, Grounding DINO, GPT-4o, and Gemini-2.5 Pro. Our results show that while some models can classify the presence of smoke when it covers a large area, all models struggle with accurate localization, especially in the early stages. Further analysis reveals that smoke volume is strongly correlated with model performance, whereas contrast plays a comparatively minor role. These findings highlight critical limitations of current MLLMs for safety-critical wildfire monitoring and underscore the need for methods that improve early-stage smoke localization.

Abstract: Forecasting from partial observations is central to world modeling. Many recent methods represent the world through images, and reduce forecasting to stochastic video generation. Although such methods excel at realism and visual fidelity, predicting pixels is computationally intensive and not directly useful in many applications, as it requires translating RGB into signals useful for decision making. An alternative approach uses features from vision foundation models (VFMs) as world representations, performing deterministic regression to predict future world states. These features can be directly translated into actionable signals such as semantic segmentation and depth, while remaining computationally efficient. However, deterministic regression averages over multiple plausible futures, undermining forecast accuracy by failing to capture uncertainty. To address this crucial limitation, we introduce a generative forecaster that performs autoregressive flow matching in VFM feature space. Our key insight is that generative modeling in this space requires encoding VFM features into a compact latent space suitable for diffusion. We show that this latent space preserves information more effectively than previously used PCA-based alternatives, both for forecasting and other applications, such as image generation. Our latent predictions can be easily decoded into multiple useful and interpretable output modalities: semantic segmentation, depth, surface normals, and even RGB. With matched architecture and compute, our method produces sharper and more accurate predictions than regression across all modalities. Our results suggest that stochastic conditional generation of VFM features offers a promising and scalable foundation for future world models.

Motivation: 现有端到端规划器仅依赖当前场景进行运动规划，在高度动态的交通环境中可能导致次优响应，因为本车行为会改变未来场景。需要建模未来场景演化以进行更复杂的推理

Method: 1. Auto-think Switch检查当前场景决定是否需要额外推理；2. Thinking模式下，Latent World Model进行CoT引导的rollout预测未来场景表示；3. Summarizer Module进一步优化运动规划；4. 简单场景使用Instant模式前向生成规划

Result: FutureX显著提升现有方法，产生更合理运动规划、减少碰撞且不影响效率，在NAVSIM上使TransFuser获得6.2 PDMS提升

Conclusion: 未来场景推理能显著增强端到端规划器的运动规划能力和性能

Abstract: In autonomous driving, end-to-end planners learn scene representations from raw sensor data and utilize them to generate a motion plan or control actions. However, exclusive reliance on the current scene for motion planning may result in suboptimal responses in highly dynamic traffic environments where ego actions further alter the future scene. To model the evolution of future scenes, we leverage the World Model to represent how the ego vehicle and its environment interact and change over time, which entails complex reasoning. The Chain of Thought (CoT) offers a promising solution by forecasting a sequence of future thoughts that subsequently guide trajectory refinement. In this paper, we propose FutureX, a CoT-driven pipeline that enhances end-to-end planners to perform complex motion planning via future scene latent reasoning and trajectory refinement. Specifically, the Auto-think Switch examines the current scene and decides whether additional reasoning is required to yield a higher-quality motion plan. Once FutureX enters the Thinking mode, the Latent World Model conducts a CoT-guided rollout to predict future scene representation, enabling the Summarizer Module to further refine the motion plan. Otherwise, FutureX operates in an Instant mode to generate motion plans in a forward pass for relatively simple scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FutureX enhances existing methods by producing more rational motion plans and fewer collisions without compromising efficiency, thereby achieving substantial overall performance gains, e.g., 6.2 PDMS improvement for TransFuser on NAVSIM. Code will be released.

Abstract: Diffusion models have significantly advanced the field of talking head generation. However, the slow inference speeds and non-autoregressive paradigms severely constrain the application of diffusion-based THG models. In this study, we propose REST, the first diffusion-based, real-time, end-to-end streaming audio-driven talking head generation framework. To support real-time end-to-end generation, a compact video latent space is first learned through high spatiotemporal VAE compression. Additionally, to enable autoregressive streaming within the compact video latent space, we introduce an ID-Context Cache mechanism, which integrates ID-Sink and Context-Cache principles to key-value caching for maintaining temporal consistency and identity coherence during long-time streaming generation. Furthermore, an Asynchronous Streaming Distillation (ASD) training strategy is proposed to mitigate error accumulation in autoregressive generation and enhance temporal consistency, which leverages a non-streaming teacher with an asynchronous noise schedule to supervise the training of the streaming student model. REST bridges the gap between autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches, demonstrating substantial value for applications requiring real-time talking head generation. Experimental results demonstrate that REST outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both generation speed and overall performance.

Conclusion: RoomPilot通过IDSL统一表示和多模态解析能力，实现了通用可控的3D室内场景生成，为游戏开发、建筑可视化和具身AI训练等应用提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generating controllable and interactive indoor scenes is fundamental to applications in game development, architectural visualization, and embodied AI training. Yet existing approaches either handle a narrow range of input modalities or rely on stochastic processes that hinder controllability. To overcome these limitations, we introduce RoomPilot, a unified framework that parses diverse multi-modal inputs--textual descriptions or CAD floor plans--into an Indoor Domain-Specific Language (IDSL) for indoor structured scene generation. The key insight is that a well-designed IDSL can act as a shared semantic representation, enabling coherent, high-quality scene synthesis from any single modality while maintaining interaction semantics. In contrast to conventional procedural methods that produce visually plausible but functionally inert layouts, RoomPilot leverages a curated dataset of interaction-annotated assets to synthesize environments exhibiting realistic object behaviors. Extensive experiments further validate its strong multi-modal understanding, fine-grained controllability in scene generation, and superior physical consistency and visual fidelity, marking a significant step toward general-purpose controllable 3D indoor scene generation.

Abstract: Incomplete multi-modal emotion recognition (IMER) aims at understanding human intentions and sentiments by comprehensively exploring the partially observed multi-source data. Although the multi-modal data is expected to provide more abundant information, the performance gap and modality under-optimization problem hinder effective multi-modal learning in practice, and are exacerbated in the confrontation of the missing data. To address this issue, we devise a novel Cross-modal Prompting (ComP) method, which emphasizes coherent information by enhancing modality-specific features and improves the overall recognition accuracy by boosting each modality's performance. Specifically, a progressive prompt generation module with a dynamic gradient modulator is proposed to produce concise and consistent modality semantic cues. Meanwhile, cross-modal knowledge propagation selectively amplifies the consistent information in modality features with the delivered prompts to enhance the discrimination of the modality-specific output. Additionally, a coordinator is designed to dynamically re-weight the modality outputs as a complement to the balance strategy to improve the model's efficacy. Extensive experiments on 4 datasets with 7 SOTA methods under different missing rates validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Abstract: Current diffusion-based portrait animation models predominantly focus on enhancing visual quality and expression realism, while overlooking generation latency and real-time performance, which restricts their application range in the live streaming scenario. We propose PersonaLive, a novel diffusion-based framework towards streaming real-time portrait animation with multi-stage training recipes. Specifically, we first adopt hybrid implicit signals, namely implicit facial representations and 3D implicit keypoints, to achieve expressive image-level motion control. Then, a fewer-step appearance distillation strategy is proposed to eliminate appearance redundancy in the denoising process, greatly improving inference efficiency. Finally, we introduce an autoregressive micro-chunk streaming generation paradigm equipped with a sliding training strategy and a historical keyframe mechanism to enable low-latency and stable long-term video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PersonaLive achieves state-of-the-art performance with up to 7-22x speedup over prior diffusion-based portrait animation models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Reformer架构在CIFAR-10小数据集上比ViT表现更好，但在更大分辨率的数据集上，ViT在实际效率和计算时间方面仍优于Reformer，尽管Reformer有理论复杂度优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准ViT存在计算复杂度高的问题（注意力计算与token数量的平方成正比），限制了其在资源受限环境和高分辨率输入上的实用性。研究者希望探索Reformer架构作为替代视觉骨干，以降低计算复杂度。

Method: 结合基于patch的token化和局部敏感哈希（LSH）注意力，Reformer模型能够近似全局自注意力，同时将理论时间复杂度从O(n²)降低到O(n log n)。研究在CIFAR-10、ImageNet-100和高分辨率医学影像数据集上评估了该模型。

Result: 1. 在CIFAR-10小数据集上，Reformer比ViT基准模型获得更高准确率
2. 在更大规模、更高分辨率的设置中，ViT在实际效率和端到端计算时间方面持续优于Reformer
3. LSH注意力虽然在理论上有优势，但只有在序列长度远大于典型高分辨率图像产生的长度时才能获得显著的计算收益

Conclusion: 尽管Reformer在理论计算复杂度上有优势，但在实际高分辨率图像处理中，标准ViT仍然更具实用性和效率。这意味着LSH注意力的实际增益需要比目前典型高分辨率图像更长的序列长度才能实现。

Abstract: Transformers have recently demonstrated strong performance in computer vision, with Vision Transformers (ViTs) leveraging self-attention to capture both low-level and high-level image features. However, standard ViTs remain computationally expensive, since global self-attention scales quadratically with the number of tokens, which limits their practicality for high-resolution inputs and resource-constrained settings.
  In this work, we investigate the Reformer architecture as an alternative vision backbone. By combining patch-based tokenization with locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) attention, our model approximates global self-attention while reducing its theoretical time complexity from $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ in the sequence length $n$. We evaluate the proposed Reformer-based vision model on CIFAR-10 to assess its behavior on small-scale datasets, on ImageNet-100 to study its accuracy--efficiency trade-off in a more realistic setting, and on a high-resolution medical imaging dataset to evaluate the model under longer token sequences.
  While the Reformer achieves higher accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to our ViT-style baseline, the ViT model consistently outperforms the Reformer in our experiments in terms of practical efficiency and end-to-end computation time across the larger and higher-resolution settings. These results suggest that, despite the theoretical advantages of LSH-based attention, meaningful computation gains require sequence lengths substantially longer than those produced by typical high-resolution images.

Abstract: Invasive species pose major global threats to ecosystems and agriculture. Serrated tussock (\textit{Nassella trichotoma}) is a highly competitive invasive grass species that disrupts native grasslands, reduces pasture productivity, and increases land management costs. In Victoria, Australia, it presents a major challenge due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact. While current ground surveys and subsequent management practices are effective at small scales, they are not feasible for landscape-scale monitoring. Although aerial imagery offers high spatial resolution suitable for detailed classification, its high cost limits scalability. Satellite-based remote sensing provides a more cost-effective and scalable alternative, though often with lower spatial resolution. This study evaluates whether multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery, despite its lower spatial resolution, can provide a comparable and cost-effective alternative for landscape-scale monitoring of serrated tussock by leveraging its higher spectral resolution and seasonal phenological information. A total of eleven models have been developed using various combinations of spectral bands, texture features, vegetation indices, and seasonal data. Using a random forest classifier, the best-performing Sentinel-2 model (M76*) has achieved an Overall Accuracy (OA) of 68\% and an Overall Kappa (OK) of 0.55, slightly outperforming the best-performing aerial imaging model's OA of 67\% and OK of 0.52 on the same dataset. These findings highlight the potential of multi-seasonal feature-enhanced satellite-based models for scalable invasive species classification.

Abstract: Current video generation models perform well at single-shot synthesis but struggle with multi-shot videos, facing critical challenges in maintaining character and background consistency across shots and flexibly generating videos of arbitrary length and shot count. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{FilmWeaver}, a novel framework designed to generate consistent, multi-shot videos of arbitrary length. First, it employs an autoregressive diffusion paradigm to achieve arbitrary-length video generation. To address the challenge of consistency, our key insight is to decouple the problem into inter-shot consistency and intra-shot coherence. We achieve this through a dual-level cache mechanism: a shot memory caches keyframes from preceding shots to maintain character and scene identity, while a temporal memory retains a history of frames from the current shot to ensure smooth, continuous motion. The proposed framework allows for flexible, multi-round user interaction to create multi-shot videos. Furthermore, due to this decoupled design, our method demonstrates high versatility by supporting downstream tasks such as multi-concept injection and video extension. To facilitate the training of our consistency-aware method, we also developed a comprehensive pipeline to construct a high-quality multi-shot video dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches on metrics for both consistency and aesthetic quality, opening up new possibilities for creating more consistent, controllable, and narrative-driven video content.

Abstract: Unsupervised industrial anomaly detection requires accurately identifying defects without labeled data. Traditional autoencoder-based methods often struggle with incomplete anomaly suppression and loss of fine details, as their single-pass decoding fails to effectively handle anomalies with varying severity and scale. We propose a recursive architecture for autoencoder (RcAE), which performs reconstruction iteratively to progressively suppress anomalies while refining normal structures. Unlike traditional single-pass models, this recursive design naturally produces a sequence of reconstructions, progressively exposing suppressed abnormal patterns. To leverage this reconstruction dynamics, we introduce a Cross Recursion Detection (CRD) module that tracks inconsistencies across recursion steps, enhancing detection of both subtle and large-scale anomalies. Additionally, we incorporate a Detail Preservation Network (DPN) to recover high-frequency textures typically lost during reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing non-diffusion methods, and achieves performance on par with recent diffusion models with only 10% of their parameters and offering substantially faster inference. These results highlight the practicality and efficiency of our approach for real-world applications.

Conclusion: ARVAE通过自回归方式和时空解耦表示，显著提升了视频自动编码器的性能，为高效视频压缩和生成提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Video autoencoders compress videos into compact latent representations for efficient reconstruction, playing a vital role in enhancing the quality and efficiency of video generation. However, existing video autoencoders often entangle spatial and temporal information, limiting their ability to capture temporal consistency and leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose Autoregressive Video Autoencoder (ARVAE), which compresses and reconstructs each frame conditioned on its predecessor in an autoregressive manner, allowing flexible processing of videos with arbitrary lengths. ARVAE introduces a temporal-spatial decoupled representation that combines downsampled flow field for temporal coherence with spatial relative compensation for newly emerged content, achieving high compression efficiency without information loss. Specifically, the encoder compresses the current and previous frames into the temporal motion and spatial supplement, while the decoder reconstructs the original frame from the latent representations given the preceding frame. A multi-stage training strategy is employed to progressively optimize the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARVAE achieves superior reconstruction quality with extremely lightweight models and small-scale training data. Moreover, evaluations on video generation tasks highlight its strong potential for downstream applications.

Abstract: Multi-view egocentric dynamic scene reconstruction holds significant research value for applications in holographic documentation of social interactions. However, existing reconstruction datasets focus on static multi-view or single-egocentric view setups, lacking multi-view egocentric datasets for dynamic scene reconstruction. Therefore, we present MultiEgo, the first multi-view egocentric dataset for 4D dynamic scene reconstruction. The dataset comprises five canonical social interaction scenes: meetings, performances, and a presentation. Each scene provides five authentic egocentric videos captured by participants wearing AR glasses. We design a hardware-based data acquisition system and processing pipeline, achieving sub-millisecond temporal synchronization across views, coupled with accurate pose annotations. Experiment validation demonstrates the practical utility and effectiveness of our dataset for free-viewpoint video (FVV) applications, establishing MultiEgo as a foundational resource for advancing multi-view egocentric dynamic scene reconstruction research.

Abstract: Recently, machine unlearning approaches have been proposed to remove sensitive information from well-trained large models. However, most existing methods are tailored for LLMs, while MLLM-oriented unlearning remains at its early stage. Inspired by recent studies exploring the internal mechanisms of MLLMs, we propose to disentangle the visual and textual knowledge embedded within MLLMs and introduce a dedicated approach to selectively erase target visual knowledge while preserving textual knowledge. Unlike previous unlearning methods that rely on output-level supervision, our approach introduces a Visual Knowledge Distillation (VKD) scheme, which leverages intermediate visual representations within the MLLM as supervision signals. This design substantially enhances both unlearning effectiveness and model utility. Moreover, since our method only fine-tunes the visual components of the MLLM, it offers significant efficiency advantages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art unlearning methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. Moreover, we are the first to evaluate the robustness of MLLM unlearning against relearning attacks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: High-definition (HD) maps are evolving from pre-annotated to real-time construction to better support autonomous driving in diverse scenarios. However, this process is hindered by low-quality input data caused by onboard sensors limited capability and frequent occlusions, leading to incomplete, noisy, or missing data, and thus reduced mapping accuracy and robustness. Recent efforts have introduced satellite images as auxiliary input, offering a stable, wide-area view to complement the limited ego perspective. However, satellite images in Bird's Eye View are often degraded by shadows and occlusions from vegetation and buildings. Prior methods using basic feature extraction and fusion remain ineffective. To address these challenges, we propose SATMapTR, a novel online map construction model that effectively fuses satellite image through two key components: (1) a gated feature refinement module that adaptively filters satellite image features by integrating high-level semantics with low-level structural cues to extract high signal-to-noise ratio map-relevant representations; and (2) a geometry-aware fusion module that consistently fuse satellite and BEV features at a grid-to-grid level, minimizing interference from irrelevant regions and low-quality inputs. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset show that SATMapTR achieves the highest mean average precision (mAP) of 73.8, outperforming state-of-the-art satellite-enhanced models by up to 14.2 mAP. It also shows lower mAP degradation under adverse weather and sensor failures, and achieves nearly 3 times higher mAP at extended perception ranges.

Abstract: Road traffic accidents represent a leading cause of mortality globally, with incidence rates rising due to increasing population, urbanization, and motorization. Rising accident rates raise concerns about traffic surveillance effectiveness. Traditional computer vision methods for accident detection struggle with limited spatiotemporal understanding and poor cross-domain generalization. Recent advances in transformer architectures excel at modeling global spatial-temporal dependencies and parallel computation. However, applying these models to automated traffic accident detection is limited by small, non-diverse datasets, hindering the development of robust, generalizable systems. To address this gap, we curated a comprehensive and balanced dataset that captures a wide spectrum of traffic environments, accident types, and contextual variations. Utilizing the curated dataset, we propose an accident detection model based on a transformer architecture using pre-extracted spatial video features. The architecture employs convolutional layers to extract local correlations across diverse patterns within a frame, while leveraging transformers to capture sequential-temporal dependencies among the retrieved features. Moreover, most existing studies neglect the integration of motion cues, which are essential for understanding dynamic scenes, especially during accidents. These approaches typically rely on static features or coarse temporal information. In this study, multiple methods for incorporating motion cues were evaluated to identify the most effective strategy. Among the tested input approaches, concatenating RGB features with optical flow achieved the highest accuracy at 88.3%. The results were further compared with vision language models (VLM) such as GPT, Gemini, and LLaVA-NeXT-Video to assess the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: Generating dynamic 3D facial animation from natural language requires understanding both temporally structured semantics and fine-grained expression changes. Existing datasets and methods mainly focus on speech-driven animation or unstructured expression sequences and therefore lack the semantic grounding and temporal structures needed for expressive human performance generation. In this work, we introduce KeyframeFace, a large-scale multimodal dataset designed for text-to-animation research through keyframe-level supervision. KeyframeFace provides 2,100 expressive scripts paired with monocular videos, per-frame ARKit coefficients, contextual backgrounds, complex emotions, manually defined keyframes, and multi-perspective annotations based on ARKit coefficients and images via Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Beyond the dataset, we propose the first text-to-animation framework that explicitly leverages LLM priors for interpretable facial motion synthesis. This design aligns the semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs with the interpretable structure of ARKit's coefficients, enabling high-fidelity expressive animation. KeyframeFace and our LLM-based framework together establish a new foundation for interpretable, keyframe-guided, and context-aware text-to-animation.

TL;DR: Flowception是一个新颖的非自回归变长视频生成框架，通过结合离散帧插入和连续帧去噪的概率路径来生成视频。相比自回归方法减少了错误累积，相比全序列流方法降低了训练计算量，同时能联合学习视频长度和内容。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的视频生成方法存在局限性：自回归方法容易产生错误累积和漂移，全序列流方法计算成本高且难以处理长视频。需要一种能高效生成高质量变长视频的框架。

Method: Flowception框架学习一种概率路径，交替执行离散帧插入和连续帧去噪。帧插入机制作为高效压缩手段处理长期上下文，同时减少训练计算量并支持局部注意力变体，可联合学习视频长度和内容。

Result: 实验结果显示，Flowception在FVD和VBench指标上优于自回归和全序列基线方法，量化结果得到定性验证。支持图像到视频生成和视频插值等多种任务的无缝集成。

Conclusion: Flowception提供了一种高效的变长视频生成框架，在减少计算成本的同时提高了生成质量，并能灵活支持多种视频生成任务，展示了非自回归视频生成的潜力。

Abstract: We present Flowception, a novel non-autoregressive and variable-length video generation framework. Flowception learns a probability path that interleaves discrete frame insertions with continuous frame denoising. Compared to autoregressive methods, Flowception alleviates error accumulation/drift as the frame insertion mechanism during sampling serves as an efficient compression mechanism to handle long-term context. Compared to full-sequence flows, our method reduces FLOPs for training three-fold, while also being more amenable to local attention variants, and allowing to learn the length of videos jointly with their content. Quantitative experimental results show improved FVD and VBench metrics over autoregressive and full-sequence baselines, which is further validated with qualitative results. Finally, by learning to insert and denoise frames in a sequence, Flowception seamlessly integrates different tasks such as image-to-video generation and video interpolation.

Abstract: We introduce Skeleton-Cache, the first training-free test-time adaptation framework for skeleton-based zero-shot action recognition (SZAR), aimed at improving model generalization to unseen actions during inference. Skeleton-Cache reformulates inference as a lightweight retrieval process over a non-parametric cache that stores structured skeleton representations, combining both global and fine-grained local descriptors. To guide the fusion of descriptor-wise predictions, we leverage the semantic reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to assign class-specific importance weights. By integrating these structured descriptors with LLM-guided semantic priors, Skeleton-Cache dynamically adapts to unseen actions without any additional training or access to training data. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D 60/120 and PKU-MMD II demonstrate that Skeleton-Cache consistently boosts the performance of various SZAR backbones under both zero-shot and generalized zero-shot settings. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Alchemist0754/Skeleton-Cache.

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在理解复杂场景方面表现出色，但在图像生成中仅被用作全局文本编码器，其推理和规划能力未得到充分利用，导致理解与生成之间存在能力差距。

Method: 提出MetaCanvas轻量级框架，让MLLMs直接在空间和时空潜空间中进行推理和规划，并与扩散生成器紧密对接。在三种不同扩散模型骨干上实现，支持六种生成任务。

Conclusion: 将MLLMs作为潜空间规划器是缩小多模态理解与生成差距的有前景方向。

Abstract: Multimodal learning has rapidly advanced visual understanding, largely via multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that use powerful LLMs as cognitive cores. In visual generation, however, these powerful core models are typically reduced to global text encoders for diffusion models, leaving most of their reasoning and planning ability unused. This creates a gap: current multimodal LLMs can parse complex layouts, attributes, and knowledge-intensive scenes, yet struggle to generate images or videos with equally precise and structured control. We propose MetaCanvas, a lightweight framework that lets MLLMs reason and plan directly in spatial and spatiotemporal latent spaces and interface tightly with diffusion generators. We empirically implement MetaCanvas on three different diffusion backbones and evaluate it across six tasks, including text-to-image generation, text/image-to-video generation, image/video editing, and in-context video generation, each requiring precise layouts, robust attribute binding, and reasoning-intensive control. MetaCanvas consistently outperforms global-conditioning baselines, suggesting that treating MLLMs as latent-space planners is a promising direction for narrowing the gap between multimodal understanding and generation.

Abstract: Ultrasound image segmentation is pivotal for clinical diagnosis, yet challenged by speckle noise and imaging artifacts. Recently, DINOv3 has shown remarkable promise in medical image segmentation with its powerful representation capabilities. However, DINOv3, pre-trained on natural images, lacks sensitivity to ultrasound-specific boundary degradation. To address this limitation, we propose FreqDINO, a frequency-guided segmentation framework that enhances boundary perception and structural consistency. Specifically, we devise a Multi-scale Frequency Extraction and Alignment (MFEA) strategy to separate low-frequency structures and multi-scale high-frequency boundary details, and align them via learnable attention. We also introduce a Frequency-Guided Boundary Refinement (FGBR) module that extracts boundary prototypes from high-frequency components and refines spatial features. Furthermore, we design a Multi-task Boundary-Guided Decoder (MBGD) to ensure spatial coherence between boundary and semantic predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreqDINO surpasses state-of-the-art methods with superior achieves remarkable generalization capability.

Abstract: With the advancement of multi-modal Large Language Models (LLMs), Video LLMs have been further developed to perform on holistic and specialized video understanding. However, existing works are limited to specialized video understanding tasks, failing to achieve a comprehensive and multi-grained video perception. To bridge this gap, we introduce UFVideo, the first Video LLM with unified multi-grained cooperative understanding capabilities. Specifically, we design unified visual-language guided alignment to flexibly handle video understanding across global, pixel and temporal scales within a single model. UFVideo dynamically encodes the visual and text inputs of different tasks and generates the textual response, temporal localization, or grounded mask. Additionally, to evaluate challenging multi-grained video understanding tasks, we construct the UFVideo-Bench consisting of three distinct collaborative tasks within the scales, which demonstrates UFVideo's flexibility and advantages over GPT-4o. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our model across 9 public benchmarks covering various common video understanding tasks, providing valuable insights for future Video LLMs.

Abstract: Reliable interpretation of multimodal data in dentistry is essential for automated oral healthcare, yet current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle to capture fine-grained dental visual details and lack sufficient reasoning ability for precise diagnosis. To address these limitations, we present DentalGPT, a specialized dental MLLM developed through high-quality domain knowledge injection and reinforcement learning. Specifically, the largest annotated multimodal dataset for dentistry to date was constructed by aggregating over 120k dental images paired with detailed descriptions that highlight diagnostically relevant visual features, making it the multimodal dataset with the most extensive collection of dental images to date. Training on this dataset significantly enhances the MLLM's visual understanding of dental conditions, while the subsequent reinforcement learning stage further strengthens its capability for multimodal complex reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations on intraoral and panoramic benchmarks, along with dental subsets of medical VQA benchmarks, show that DentalGPT achieves superior performance in disease classification and dental VQA tasks, outperforming many state-of-the-art MLLMs despite having only 7B parameters. These results demonstrate that high-quality dental data combined with staged adaptation provides an effective pathway for building capable and domain-specialized dental MLLMs.

Motivation: 现有的深度学习模型在自动划分离冰边界时，难以准确分类受季节性条件（如冰屑混合物或积雪覆盖表面）影响的区域，需要改进模型以提高预测稳定性。

Method: 将多帧卫星图像时间序列并行处理，并在对应的特征图之间交换时序信息以稳定每个预测，将该方法集成到当前最先进的Tyrion架构中。

Result: 在CaFFe基准数据集上取得了新的最佳性能：平均距离误差184.4米，平均交并比83.6。

Conclusion: 提出的时序信息交换方法显著提高了离冰边界划定的准确性，特别是在处理季节性变化影响区域时表现出更好的稳定性。

Abstract: The calving fronts of marine-terminating glaciers undergo constant changes. These changes significantly affect the glacier's mass and dynamics, demanding continuous monitoring. To address this need, deep learning models were developed that can automatically delineate the calving front in Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery. However, these models often struggle to correctly classify areas affected by seasonal conditions such as ice melange or snow-covered surfaces. To address this issue, we propose to process multiple frames from a satellite image time series of the same glacier in parallel and exchange temporal information between the corresponding feature maps to stabilize each prediction. We integrate our approach into the current state-of-the-art architecture Tyrion and accomplish a new state-of-the-art performance on the CaFFe benchmark dataset. In particular, we achieve a Mean Distance Error of 184.4 m and a mean Intersection over Union of 83.6.

Motivation: 当前的动态场景重建方法难以准确处理薄结构和复杂运动，需要更精确的跟踪和深度信息以提升重建质量。

Method: 结合视频分割与极线误差图生成物体级掩码，指导对象深度损失以锐化深度图，使用骨架采样和掩码引导的重新识别获得2D轨迹。引入虚拟视角深度损失去除漂浮物，骨架投影损失将运动节点与轨迹绑定，保持几何细节和运动连贯性。

Conclusion: 该系统通过增强的动态高斯泼溅先验，有效提升动态场景的重建质量，尤其在处理薄结构和复杂运动方面表现优异。

Abstract: We introduce a fully automatic pipeline for dynamic scene reconstruction from casually captured monocular RGB videos. Rather than designing a new scene representation, we enhance the priors that drive Dynamic Gaussian Splatting. Video segmentation combined with epipolar-error maps yields object-level masks that closely follow thin structures; these masks (i) guide an object-depth loss that sharpens the consistent video depth, and (ii) support skeleton-based sampling plus mask-guided re-identification to produce reliable, comprehensive 2-D tracks. Two additional objectives embed the refined priors in the reconstruction stage: a virtual-view depth loss removes floaters, and a scaffold-projection loss ties motion nodes to the tracks, preserving fine geometry and coherent motion. The resulting system surpasses previous monocular dynamic scene reconstruction methods and delivers visibly superior renderings

Abstract: Efficient crop detection via Unmanned Aerial Vehicles is critical for scaling precision agriculture, yet it remains challenging due to the small scale of targets and environmental variability. This paper addresses the detection of rice seedlings in paddy fields by leveraging a Faster R-CNN architecture initialized via transfer learning. To overcome the specific difficulties of detecting minute objects in high-resolution aerial imagery, we curate a significant UAV dataset for training and rigorously evaluate the model's generalization capabilities. Specifically, we validate performance across three distinct test sets acquired at different temporal intervals, thereby assessing robustness against varying imaging conditions. Our empirical results demonstrate that transfer learning not only facilitates the rapid convergence of object detection models in agricultural contexts but also yields consistent performance despite domain shifts in image acquisition.

Motivation: 模型指纹检测技术虽可用于追踪AI生成图像的来源模型，但其在对抗条件下的鲁棒性尚未得到充分研究。由于缺乏系统性安全评估，这些技术在实际应用中的可靠性存疑。

Method: 形式化了白盒和黑盒两种威胁模型，涵盖指纹移除和指纹伪造两类攻击目标。实现了五种攻击策略，在12个最先进的图像生成器上评估了14种代表性的指纹检测方法，覆盖RGB、频率和学习特征三大域。

Result: 移除攻击在白盒设置下成功率常超过80%，在受限制的黑盒访问下也超过50%。伪造攻击难度较大，但成功率随目标模型显著变化。准确性最高的方法往往对攻击最脆弱，无一种方法在所有威胁模型中同时实现高鲁棒性和高准确性。

Conclusion: 指纹检测技术存在显著的安全漏洞，需要开发平衡鲁棒性和准确性的新方法。研究指出了实现这一目标的最有前景的技术路径。

Abstract: Model fingerprint detection techniques have emerged as a promising approach for attributing AI-generated images to their source models, but their robustness under adversarial conditions remains largely unexplored. We present the first systematic security evaluation of these techniques, formalizing threat models that encompass both white- and black-box access and two attack goals: fingerprint removal, which erases identifying traces to evade attribution, and fingerprint forgery, which seeks to cause misattribution to a target model. We implement five attack strategies and evaluate 14 representative fingerprinting methods across RGB, frequency, and learned-feature domains on 12 state-of-the-art image generators. Our experiments reveal a pronounced gap between clean and adversarial performance. Removal attacks are highly effective, often achieving success rates above 80% in white-box settings and over 50% under constrained black-box access. While forgery is more challenging than removal, its success significantly varies across targeted models. We also identify a utility-robustness trade-off: methods with the highest attribution accuracy are often vulnerable to attacks. Although some techniques exhibit robustness in specific settings, none achieves high robustness and accuracy across all evaluated threat models. These findings highlight the need for techniques balancing robustness and accuracy, and identify the most promising approaches for advancing this goal.

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) stands as a significant challenge in computer vision, dedicated to identifying and segmenting objects visually highly integrated with their backgrounds. Current mainstream methods have made progress in cross-layer feature fusion, but two critical issues persist during the decoding stage. The first is insufficient cross-channel information interaction within the same-layer features, limiting feature expressiveness. The second is the inability to effectively co-model boundary and region information, making it difficult to accurately reconstruct complete regions and sharp boundaries of objects. To address the first issue, we propose the Channel Information Interaction Module (CIIM), which introduces a horizontal-vertical integration mechanism in the channel dimension. This module performs feature reorganization and interaction across channels to effectively capture complementary cross-channel information. To address the second issue, we construct a collaborative decoding architecture guided by prior knowledge. This architecture generates boundary priors and object localization maps through Boundary Extraction (BE) and Region Extraction (RE) modules, then employs hybrid attention to collaboratively calibrate decoded features, effectively overcoming semantic ambiguity and imprecise boundaries. Additionally, the Multi-scale Enhancement (MSE) module enriches contextual feature representations. Extensive experiments on four COD benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of the proposed model. We further transferred our model to the Salient Object Detection (SOD) task and demonstrated its adaptability across downstream tasks, including polyp segmentation, transparent object detection, and industrial and road defect detection.

Motivation: 人类能够直觉地并行化复杂的活动，但模型能否仅通过观察单人的活动视频来学习这种能力？作者希望探索如何从单个自我为中心的视频中抽象出可行的多角色并行执行方案。

Method: 作者形式化定义了N体问题，提出一系列评估指标来衡量性能（加速比、任务覆盖率）和可行性（空间碰撞、物体冲突、因果约束）。同时引入结构化提示策略，引导视觉语言模型（VLM）对3D环境、物体使用和时间依赖进行推理，产生可行的并行执行方案。

Result: 在EPIC-Kitchens和HD-EPIC的100个视频上进行实验，N=2的情况下，相比基线提示方法（Gemini 2.5 Pro），论文的方法将动作覆盖率提高了45%，同时将碰撞率、物体冲突和因果冲突分别降低了55%、45%和55%。

Conclusion: 通过结构化推理提示，视觉语言模型能够从单人视频中生成物理可行的多角色并行任务计划，平衡执行效率与真实世界约束，为实现更高效的人类活动协同提供了一种可行路径。

Abstract: Humans can intuitively parallelise complex activities, but can a model learn this from observing a single person? Given one egocentric video, we introduce the N-Body Problem: how N individuals, can hypothetically perform the same set of tasks observed in this video. The goal is to maximise speed-up, but naive assignment of video segments to individuals often violates real-world constraints, leading to physically impossible scenarios like two people using the same object or occupying the same space. To address this, we formalise the N-Body Problem and propose a suite of metrics to evaluate both performance (speed-up, task coverage) and feasibility (spatial collisions, object conflicts and causal constraints). We then introduce a structured prompting strategy that guides a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to reason about the 3D environment, object usage, and temporal dependencies to produce a viable parallel execution. On 100 videos from EPIC-Kitchens and HD-EPIC, our method for N = 2 boosts action coverage by 45% over a baseline prompt for Gemini 2.5 Pro, while simultaneously slashing collision rates, object and causal conflicts by 55%, 45% and 55% respectively.

Abstract: With the surge of pre-trained text-to-image flow matching models, text-based image editing performance has gained remarkable improvement, especially for \underline{simple editing} that only contains a single editing target. To satisfy the exploding editing requirements, the \underline{complex editing} which contains multiple editing targets has posed as a more challenging task. However, current complex editing solutions: single-round and multi-round editing are limited by long text following and cumulative inconsistency, respectively. Thus, they struggle to strike a balance between semantic alignment and source consistency. In this paper, we propose \textbf{FlowDC}, which decouples the complex editing into multiple sub-editing effects and superposes them in parallel during the editing process. Meanwhile, we observed that the velocity quantity that is orthogonal to the editing displacement harms the source structure preserving. Thus, we decompose the velocity and decay the orthogonal part for better source consistency. To evaluate the effectiveness of complex editing settings, we construct a complex editing benchmark: Complex-PIE-Bench. On two benchmarks, FlowDC shows superior results compared with existing methods. We also detail the ablations of our module designs.

Abstract: Existing DiT-based audio-driven avatar generation methods have achieved considerable progress, yet their broader application is constrained by limitations such as high computational overhead and the inability to synthesize long-duration videos. Autoregressive methods address this problem by applying block-wise autoregressive diffusion methods. However, these methods suffer from the problem of error accumulation and quality degradation. To address this, we propose JoyAvatar, an audio-driven autoregressive model capable of real-time inference and infinite-length video generation with the following contributions: (1) Progressive Step Bootstrapping (PSB), which allocates more denoising steps to initial frames to stabilize generation and reduce error accumulation; (2) Motion Condition Injection (MCI), enhancing temporal coherence by injecting noise-corrupted previous frames as motion condition; and (3) Unbounded RoPE via Cache-Resetting (URCR), enabling infinite-length generation through dynamic positional encoding. Our 1.3B-parameter causal model achieves 16 FPS on a single GPU and achieves competitive results in visual quality, temporal consistency, and lip synchronization.

Abstract: Driver fatigue remains a leading cause of road accidents, with 24\% of crashes involving drowsy drivers. While yawning serves as an early behavioral indicator of fatigue, existing machine learning approaches face significant challenges due to video-annotated datasets that introduce systematic noise from coarse temporal annotations. We develop a semi-automated labeling pipeline with human-in-the-loop verification, which we apply to YawDD, enabling more accurate model training. Training the established MNasNet classifier and YOLOv11 detector architectures on YawDD+ improves frame accuracy by up to 6\% and mAP by 5\% over video-level supervision, achieving 99.34\% classification accuracy and 95.69\% detection mAP. The resulting approach deliver up to 59.8 FPS on edge AI hardware (NVIDIA Jetson Nano), confirming that enhanced data quality alone supports on-device yawning monitoring without server-side computation.

Abstract: Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) have shown tremendous potential for learning 3D point cloud representations without human annotations. However, SSL for 3D point clouds still faces critical challenges due to irregular geometry, shortcut-prone reconstruction, and unbalanced semantics distribution. In this work, we propose DOS (Distilling Observable Softmaps), a novel SSL framework that self-distills semantic relevance softmaps only at observable (unmasked) points. This strategy prevents information leakage from masked regions and provides richer supervision than discrete token-to-prototype assignments. To address the challenge of unbalanced semantics in an unsupervised setting, we introduce Zipfian prototypes and incorporate them using a modified Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, Zipf-Sinkhorn, which enforces a power-law prior over prototype usage and modulates the sharpness of the target softmap during training. DOS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on semantic segmentation and 3D object detection across multiple benchmarks, including nuScenes, Waymo, SemanticKITTI, ScanNet, and ScanNet200, without relying on extra data or annotations. Our results demonstrate that observable-point softmaps distillation offers a scalable and effective paradigm for learning robust 3D representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADMorph是一个用于几何驱动的参数化CAD编辑的迭代框架，通过计划-生成-验证三阶段，利用预训练领域基础模型（参数到形状扩散模型和掩码参数预测模型）解决结构保持、语义有效性和形状保真度问题，且无需编辑数据三元组训练


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CAD模型包含参数化构造序列和可见几何形状两种耦合形式，在迭代设计过程中对几何形状的调整需要同步编辑底层参数序列，但现有方法面临保持原始序列结构、确保语义有效性、实现高形状保真度以及数据稀缺等多重挑战

Method: CADMorph采用迭代的计划-生成-验证框架，集成了两个预训练模型：1) 参数到形状(P2S)潜在扩散模型用于形状感知和编辑规划；2) 掩码参数预测(MPP)模型用于语义有效的参数填充。通过在推理阶段协同这些模型，实现无编辑数据三元组的训练

Result: CADMorph在几何驱动的参数化CAD编辑任务中超越了GPT-4o和专门的CAD基线模型，支持迭代编辑和逆向工程增强等下游应用，成功解决了数据稀缺问题并实现了高质量的编辑效果

Conclusion: CADMorph通过巧妙的计划-生成-验证框架，充分利用预训练领域基础模型的内在几何意识和设计知识，有效解决了参数化CAD编辑中结构保持、语义有效性和形状保真度的关键挑战，为CAD设计自动化提供了创新解决方案

Abstract: A Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model encodes an object in two coupled forms: a parametric construction sequence and its resulting visible geometric shape. During iterative design, adjustments to the geometric shape inevitably require synchronized edits to the underlying parametric sequence, called geometry-driven parametric CAD editing. The task calls for 1) preserving the original sequence's structure, 2) ensuring each edit's semantic validity, and 3) maintaining high shape fidelity to the target shape, all under scarce editing data triplets. We present CADMorph, an iterative plan-generate-verify framework that orchestrates pretrained domain-specific foundation models during inference: a parameter-to-shape (P2S) latent diffusion model and a masked-parameter-prediction (MPP) model. In the planning stage, cross-attention maps from the P2S model pinpoint the segments that need modification and offer editing masks. The MPP model then infills these masks with semantically valid edits in the generation stage. During verification, the P2S model embeds each candidate sequence in shape-latent space, measures its distance to the target shape, and selects the closest one. The three stages leverage the inherent geometric consciousness and design knowledge in pretrained priors, and thus tackle structure preservation, semantic validity, and shape fidelity respectively. Besides, both P2S and MPP models are trained without triplet data, bypassing the data-scarcity bottleneck. CADMorph surpasses GPT-4o and specialized CAD baselines, and supports downstream applications such as iterative editing and reverse-engineering enhancement.

TL;DR: 该研究系统分析了VGGT模型的内部机制，探究其是基于几何概念还是依赖数据驱动的外观先验，发现模型在全局注意力层中隐式执行对应匹配并编码极线几何，同时验证了其对外观变化和相机配置的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是探究VGGT这一3D基础模型的内部工作原理——它是否真正建立了几何理解，还是主要依赖从大数据中学到的外观先验知识，这对于理解现代视觉Transformer模型的几何基础能力具有重要意义。

Method: 通过系统性分析VGGT的内部机制，包括探测中间特征、分析注意力模式、进行干预实验，以及使用空间输入掩码和扰动实验来评估模型对遮挡、外观变化和相机配置的鲁棒性，并与经典多阶段流程进行比较。

Result: 研究发现VGGT在其全局注意力层中隐式执行对应匹配并编码极线几何，尽管训练时没有使用显式的几何约束。模型表现出对遮挡、外观变化和相机配置的较强鲁棒性，表明它同时内化了几何结构并利用了数据驱动先验。

Conclusion: 研究得出结论：VGGT在训练过程中自发地学习到了几何结构（包括对应匹配和极线几何），同时有效利用了数据驱动先验，这表明现代视觉Transformer能够在没有显式几何监督的情况下内化基础几何概念。

Abstract: The Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) is a 3D foundation model that infers camera geometry and scene structure in a single feed-forward pass. Trained in a supervised, single-step fashion on large datasets, VGGT raises a key question: does it build upon geometric concepts like traditional multi-view methods, or does it rely primarily on learned appearance-based data-driven priors? In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of VGGT's internal mechanisms to uncover whether geometric understanding emerges within its representations. By probing intermediate features, analyzing attention patterns, and performing interventions, we examine how the model implements its functionality. Our findings reveal that VGGT implicitly performs correspondence matching within its global attention layers and encodes epipolar geometry, despite being trained without explicit geometric constraints. We further investigate VGGT's dependence on its learned data priors. Using spatial input masking and perturbation experiments, we assess its robustness to occlusions, appearance variations, and camera configurations, comparing it with classical multi-stage pipelines. Together, these insights highlight how VGGT internalizes geometric structure while using learned data-driven priors.

Our experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art performance on EvQA, highlighting the significant potential of MLLMs in event-based vision.

Abstract: Fine-scale forest monitoring is essential for understanding canopy structure and its dynamics, which are key indicators of carbon stocks, biodiversity, and forest health. Deep learning is particularly effective for this task, as it integrates spectral, temporal, and spatial signals that jointly reflect the canopy structure. To address this need, we introduce THREASURE-Net, a novel end-to-end framework for Tree Height Regression And Super-Resolution. The model is trained on Sentinel-2 time series using reference height metrics derived from LiDAR HD data at multiple spatial resolutions over Metropolitan France to produce annual height maps. We evaluate three model variants, producing tree-height predictions at 2.5 m, 5 m, and 10 m resolution. THREASURE-Net does not rely on any pretrained model nor on reference very high resolution optical imagery to train its super-resolution module; instead, it learns solely from LiDAR-derived height information. Our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods based on Sentinel data and is competitive with methods based on very high resolution imagery. It can be deployed to generate high-precision annual canopy-height maps, achieving mean absolute errors of 2.62 m, 2.72 m, and 2.88 m at 2.5 m, 5 m, and 10 m resolution, respectively. These results highlight the potential of THREASURE-Net for scalable and cost-effective structural monitoring of temperate forests using only freely available satellite data.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种可端到端训练的、任务自适应的视频关键帧选择框架，通过Chain-of-Thought指导的小语言模型生成任务特定的隐式查询向量，结合连续集合级目标函数和学生-教师互学习机制，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Top-K帧选择方法存在两个主要问题：1）独立评分机制导致选择的时间聚集和视觉冗余帧；2）使用MLLM静态生成的伪标签训练轻量级选择器无法动态适应任务目标。

Method: 1) 用Chain-of-Thought指导SLM生成任务特定的隐式查询向量；2) 定义包含相关性、覆盖度和冗余度的连续集合级目标函数，通过Gumbel-Softmax进行可微分优化；3) 采用学生-教师互学习，通过KL散度对齐学生选择器和教师推理器的帧重要性分布。

Result: 在Video-MME、LongVideoBench、MLVU和NExT-QA等多个基准测试中，该方法显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了端到端的任务自适应帧选择，消除了对静态伪标签的依赖，通过连续优化和互学习机制有效解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Key frame selection in video understanding presents significant challenges. Traditional top-K selection methods, which score frames independently, often fail to optimize the selection as a whole. This independent scoring frequently results in selecting frames that are temporally clustered and visually redundant. Additionally, training lightweight selectors using pseudo labels generated offline by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) prevents the supervisory signal from dynamically adapting to task objectives. To address these limitations, we propose an end-to-end trainable, task-adaptive framework for frame selection. A Chain-of-Thought approach guides a Small Language Model (SLM) to generate task-specific implicit query vectors, which are combined with multimodal features to enable dynamic frame scoring. We further define a continuous set-level objective function that incorporates relevance, coverage, and redundancy, enabling differentiable optimization via Gumbel-Softmax to select optimal frame combinations at the set level. Finally, student-teacher mutual learning is employed, where the student selector (SLM) and teacher reasoner (MLLM) are trained to align their frame importance distributions via KL divergence. Combined with cross-entropy loss, this enables end-to-end optimization, eliminating reliance on static pseudo labels. Experiments across various benchmarks, including Video-MME, LongVideoBench, MLVU, and NExT-QA, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches.

Motivation: 现代文本到图像模型在文本描述与生成图像之间实现组合对齐（涵盖对象、属性和空间关系）仍是一个核心挑战，而新兴视觉自回归模型在这一方面的表现尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 对六种文本到图像系统进行全面基准测试，使用T2I‑CompBench++和GenEval评估套件，评估颜色和属性绑定、空间关系、数量能力和复杂多对象提示等任务。

Result: Infinity‑8B在组合对齐方面表现最强，Infinity‑2B在多个类别中与大型扩散模型相当或更优；SDXL和PixArt‑α在属性敏感和空间任务上持续存在弱点。

Conclusion: 该研究为文本到图像模型的未来发展建立了统一的基准线，首次系统比较了视觉自回归和扩散方法在组合对齐任务上的表现。

Abstract: Achieving compositional alignment between textual descriptions and generated images - covering objects, attributes, and spatial relationships - remains a core challenge for modern text-to-image (T2I) models. Although diffusion-based architectures have been widely studied, the compositional behavior of emerging Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models is still largely unexamined. We benchmark six diverse T2I systems - SDXL, PixArt-$α$, Flux-Dev, Flux-Schnell, Infinity-2B, and Infinity-8B - across the full T2I-CompBench++ and GenEval suites, evaluating alignment in color and attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy, and complex multi-object prompts. Across both benchmarks, Infinity-8B achieves the strongest overall compositional alignment, while Infinity-2B also matches or exceeds larger diffusion models in several categories, highlighting favorable efficiency-performance trade-offs. In contrast, SDXL and PixArt-$α$ show persistent weaknesses in attribute-sensitive and spatial tasks. These results provide the first systematic comparison of VAR and diffusion approaches to compositional alignment and establish unified baselines for the future development of the T2I model.

Abstract: Despite the success of deep learning based models in medical image segmentation, most state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods perform fully-supervised learning, which commonly rely on large scale annotated training datasets. However, medical image annotation is highly time-consuming, hindering its clinical applications. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has been emerged as an appealing strategy in training with limited annotations, largely reducing the labelling cost. We propose a novel SSL framework SSL-MedSAM2, which contains a training-free few-shot learning branch TFFS-MedSAM2 based on the pretrained large foundation model Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for pseudo label generation, and an iterative fully-supervised learning branch FSL-nnUNet based on nnUNet for pseudo label refinement. The results on MICCAI2025 challenge CARE-LiSeg (Liver Segmentation) demonstrate an outstanding performance of SSL-MedSAM2 among other methods.

Abstract: 3D teeth segmentation, involving the localization of tooth instances and their semantic categorization in 3D dental models, is a critical yet challenging task in digital dentistry due to the complexity of real-world dentition. In this paper, we propose 3DTeethSAM, an adaptation of the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for 3D teeth segmentation. SAM2 is a pretrained foundation model for image and video segmentation, demonstrating a strong backbone in various downstream scenarios. To adapt SAM2 for 3D teeth data, we render images of 3D teeth models from predefined views, apply SAM2 for 2D segmentation, and reconstruct 3D results using 2D-3D projections. Since SAM2's performance depends on input prompts and its initial outputs often have deficiencies, and given its class-agnostic nature, we introduce three light-weight learnable modules: (1) a prompt embedding generator to derive prompt embeddings from image embeddings for accurate mask decoding, (2) a mask refiner to enhance SAM2's initial segmentation results, and (3) a mask classifier to categorize the generated masks. Additionally, we incorporate Deformable Global Attention Plugins (DGAP) into SAM2's image encoder. The DGAP enhances both the segmentation accuracy and the speed of the training process. Our method has been validated on the 3DTeethSeg benchmark, achieving an IoU of 91.90% on high-resolution 3D teeth meshes, establishing a new state-of-the-art in the field.

Abstract: Benchmarking 3D spatial understanding of foundation models is essential for real-world applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. Existing evaluations often rely on downstream finetuning with linear heads or task-specific decoders, making it difficult to isolate the intrinsic 3D reasoning ability of pretrained encoders. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark for in-context 3D scene understanding that requires no finetuning and directly probes the quality of dense visual features. Building on the Hummingbird framework, which evaluates in-context 2D scene understanding, we extend the setup to the 3D Multi-View ImageNet (MVImgNet) dataset. Given a set of images from objects in specific angles (keys), we benchmark the performance of segmenting novel views (queries) and report the scores in 4 categories of easy, medium, hard, and extreme based on the key-query view contrast. We benchmark 8 state-of-the-art foundation models and show DINO-based encoders remain competitive across large viewpoint shifts, while 3D-aware models like VGGT require dedicated multi-view adjustments.

Abstract: Seismic processing transforms raw data into subsurface images essential for geophysical applications. Traditional methods face challenges, such as noisy data, and manual parameter tuning, among others. Recently deep learning approaches have proposed alternative solutions to some of these problems. However, important challenges of existing deep learning approaches are spatially inconsistent results across neighboring seismic gathers and lack of user-control. We address these limitations by introducing ContextSeisNet, an in-context learning model, to seismic demultiple processing. Our approach conditions predictions on a support set of spatially related example pairs: neighboring common-depth point gathers from the same seismic line and their corresponding labels. This allows the model to learn task-specific processing behavior at inference time by observing how similar gathers should be processed, without any retraining. This method provides both flexibility through user-defined examples and improved lateral consistency across seismic lines. On synthetic data, ContextSeisNet outperforms a U-Net baseline quantitatively and demonstrates enhanced spatial coherence between neighboring gathers. On field data, our model achieves superior lateral consistency compared to both traditional Radon demultiple and the U-Net baseline. Relative to the U-Net, ContextSeisNet also delivers improved near-offset performance and more complete multiple removal. Notably, ContextSeisNet achieves comparable field data performance despite being trained on 90% less data, demonstrating substantial data efficiency. These results establish ContextSeisNet as a practical approach for spatially consistent seismic demultiple with potential applicability to other seismic processing tasks.

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents adopt an end-to-end paradigm that maps a screenshot to an action sequence, thereby automating repetitive tasks in virtual environments. However, existing GUI agents are evaluated almost exclusively on commodity software such as Microsoft Word and Excel. Professional Computer-Aided Design (CAD) suites promise an order-of-magnitude higher economic return, yet remain the weakest performance domain for existing agents and are still far from replacing expert Electronic-Design-Automation (EDA) engineers. We therefore present the first systematic study that deploys GUI agents for EDA workflows. Our contributions are: (1) a large-scale dataset named GUI-EDA, including 5 CAD tools and 5 physical domains, comprising 2,000+ high-quality screenshot-answer-action pairs recorded by EDA scientists and engineers during real-world component design; (2) a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates 30+ mainstream GUI agents, demonstrating that EDA tasks constitute a major, unsolved challenge; and (3) an EDA-specialized metric named EDAgent, equipped with a reflection mechanism that achieves reliable performance on industrial CAD software and, for the first time, outperforms Ph.D. students majored in Electrical Engineering. This work extends GUI agents from generic office automation to specialized, high-value engineering domains and offers a new avenue for advancing EDA productivity.

Abstract: Recovering high-fidelity 3D images from sparse or degraded 2D images is a fundamental challenge in medical imaging, with broad applications ranging from 3D ultrasound reconstruction to MRI super-resolution. In the context of fetal MRI, high-resolution 3D reconstruction of the brain from motion-corrupted low-resolution 2D acquisitions is a prerequisite for accurate neurodevelopmental diagnosis. While implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently established state-of-the-art performance in self-supervised slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR), they suffer from a critical computational bottleneck: accurately modeling the image acquisition physics requires expensive stochastic Monte Carlo sampling to approximate the point spread function (PSF). In this work, we propose a shift from neural network based implicit representations to Gaussian based explicit representations. By parameterizing the HR 3D image volume as a field of anisotropic Gaussian primitives, we leverage the property of Gaussians being closed under convolution and thus derive a \textit{closed-form analytical solution} for the forward model. This formulation reduces the previously intractable acquisition integral to an exact covariance addition ($\mathbfΣ_{obs} = \mathbfΣ_{HR} + \mathbfΣ_{PSF}$), effectively bypassing the need for compute-intensive stochastic sampling while ensuring exact gradient propagation. We demonstrate that our approach matches the reconstruction quality of self-supervised state-of-the-art SVR frameworks while delivering a 5$\times$--10$\times$ speed-up on neonatal and fetal data. With convergence often reached in under 30 seconds, our framework paves the way towards translation into clinical routine of real-time fetal 3D MRI. Code will be public at {https://github.com/m-dannecker/Gaussian-Primitives-for-Fast-SVR}.

Abstract: We introduce FactorPortrait, a video diffusion method for controllable portrait animation that enables lifelike synthesis from disentangled control signals of facial expressions, head movement, and camera viewpoints. Given a single portrait image, a driving video, and camera trajectories, our method animates the portrait by transferring facial expressions and head movements from the driving video while simultaneously enabling novel view synthesis from arbitrary viewpoints. We utilize a pre-trained image encoder to extract facial expression latents from the driving video as control signals for animation generation. Such latents implicitly capture nuanced facial expression dynamics with identity and pose information disentangled, and they are efficiently injected into the video diffusion transformer through our proposed expression controller. For camera and head pose control, we employ Plücker ray maps and normal maps rendered from 3D body mesh tracking. To train our model, we curate a large-scale synthetic dataset containing diverse combinations of camera viewpoints, head poses, and facial expression dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in realism, expressiveness, control accuracy, and view consistency.

Abstract: Recent advances in image understanding have enabled methods that leverage large language models for multimodal reasoning in remote sensing. However, existing approaches still struggle to steer models to the user-relevant regions when only simple, generic text prompts are available. Moreover, in large-scale aerial imagery many objects exhibit highly similar visual appearances and carry rich inter-object relationships, which further complicates accurate recognition. To address these challenges, we propose Cross-modal Context-aware Learning for Visual Prompt-Guided Multimodal Image Understanding (CLV-Net). CLV-Net lets users supply a simple visual cue, a bounding box, to indicate a region of interest, and uses that cue to guide the model to generate correlated segmentation masks and captions that faithfully reflect user intent. Central to our design is a Context-Aware Mask Decoder that models and integrates inter-object relationships to strengthen target representations and improve mask quality. In addition, we introduce a Semantic and Relationship Alignment module: a Cross-modal Semantic Consistency Loss enhances fine-grained discrimination among visually similar targets, while a Relationship Consistency Loss enforces alignment between textual relations and visual interactions. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that CLV-Net outperforms existing methods and establishes new state-of-the-art results. The model effectively captures user intent and produces precise, intention-aligned multimodal outputs.

Conclusion: Depth Copy Paste框架通过多模态语义匹配、深度感知的前景提取和几何一致的粘贴机制，有效解决了传统数据增强的局限性，为人脸检测系统提供了更高质量的训练样本。

Abstract: Data augmentation is crucial for improving the robustness of face detection systems, especially under challenging conditions such as occlusion, illumination variation, and complex environments. Traditional copy paste augmentation often produces unrealistic composites due to inaccurate foreground extraction, inconsistent scene geometry, and mismatched background semantics. To address these limitations, we propose Depth Copy Paste, a multimodal and depth aware augmentation framework that generates diverse and physically consistent face detection training samples by copying full body person instances and pasting them into semantically compatible scenes. Our approach first employs BLIP and CLIP to jointly assess semantic and visual coherence, enabling automatic retrieval of the most suitable background images for the given foreground person. To ensure high quality foreground masks that preserve facial details, we integrate SAM3 for precise segmentation and Depth-Anything to extract only the non occluded visible person regions, preventing corrupted facial textures from being used in augmentation. For geometric realism, we introduce a depth guided sliding window placement mechanism that searches over the background depth map to identify paste locations with optimal depth continuity and scale alignment. The resulting composites exhibit natural depth relationships and improved visual plausibility. Extensive experiments show that Depth Copy Paste provides more diverse and realistic training data, leading to significant performance improvements in downstream face detection tasks compared with traditional copy paste and depth free augmentation methods.

Conclusion: 实验结果表明所提方法有效，能在非受控成像条件下实现多种来源的文本分类，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: This is to present a text image classifier device that identifies textual content in images and then categorizes each image into one of four predefined categories, including Invoice, Form, Letter, or Report. The device supports a gallery mode, in which users browse files on flash disks, hard disk drives, or microSD cards, and a live mode which renders feeds of cameras connected to it. Its design is specifically aimed at addressing pragmatic challenges, such as changing light, random orientation, curvature or partial coverage of text, low resolution, and slightly visible text. The steps of the processing process are divided into four steps: image acquisition and preprocessing, textual elements detection with the help of DBNet++ (Differentiable Binarization Network Plus) model, BART (Bidirectional Auto-Regressive Transformers) model that classifies detected textual elements, and the presentation of the results through a user interface written in Python and PyQt5. All the stages are connected in such a way that they form a smooth workflow. The system achieved a text recognition rate of about 94.62% when tested over ten hours on the mentioned Total-Text dataset, that includes high resolution images, created so as to represent a wide range of problematic conditions. These experimental results support the effectiveness of the suggested methodology to practice, mixed-source text categorization, even in uncontrolled imaging conditions.

Abstract: Change detection in remote sensing imagery is essential for applications such as urban planning, environmental monitoring, and disaster management. Traditional change detection methods typically identify all changes between two temporal images without distinguishing the types of transitions, which can lead to results that may not align with specific user needs. Although semantic change detection methods have attempted to address this by categorizing changes into predefined classes, these methods rely on rigid class definitions and fixed model architectures, making it difficult to mix datasets with different label sets or reuse models across tasks, as the output channels are tightly coupled with the number and type of semantic classes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Referring Change Detection (RCD), which leverages natural language prompts to detect specific classes of changes in remote sensing images. By integrating language understanding with visual analysis, our approach allows users to specify the exact type of change they are interested in. However, training models for RCD is challenging due to the limited availability of annotated data and severe class imbalance in existing datasets. To address this, we propose a two-stage framework consisting of (I) \textbf{RCDNet}, a cross-modal fusion network designed for referring change detection, and (II) \textbf{RCDGen}, a diffusion-based synthetic data generation pipeline that produces realistic post-change images and change maps for a specified category using only pre-change image, without relying on semantic segmentation masks and thereby significantly lowering the barrier to scalable data creation. Experiments across multiple datasets show that our framework enables scalable and targeted change detection. Project website is here: https://yilmazkorkmaz1.github.io/RCD.

Abstract: We present a weak to strong generalization methodology for fully automated training of a multi-head extension of the Mask-RCNN method with efficient channel attention for reliable segmentation of overlapping cell nuclei in multiplex cyclic immunofluorescent (IF) whole-slide images (WSI), and present evidence for pseudo-label correction and coverage expansion, the key phenomena underlying weak to strong generalization. This method can learn to segment de novo a new class of images from a new instrument and/or a new imaging protocol without the need for human annotations. We also present metrics for automated self-diagnosis of segmentation quality in production environments, where human visual proofreading of massive WSI images is unaffordable. Our method was benchmarked against five current widely used methods and showed a significant improvement. The code, sample WSI images, and high-resolution segmentation results are provided in open form for community adoption and adaptation.

Abstract: Visual generation grounded in Visual Foundation Model (VFM) representations offers a highly promising unified pathway for integrating visual understanding, perception, and generation. Despite this potential, training large-scale text-to-image diffusion models entirely within the VFM representation space remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we scale the SVG (Self-supervised representations for Visual Generation) framework, proposing SVG-T2I to support high-quality text-to-image synthesis directly in the VFM feature domain. By leveraging a standard text-to-image diffusion pipeline, SVG-T2I achieves competitive performance, reaching 0.75 on GenEval and 85.78 on DPG-Bench. This performance validates the intrinsic representational power of VFMs for generative tasks. We fully open-source the project, including the autoencoder and generation model, together with their training, inference, evaluation pipelines, and pre-trained weights, to facilitate further research in representation-driven visual generation.

Abstract: Generating realistic synthetic microscopy images is critical for training deep learning models in label-scarce environments, such as cell counting with many cells per image. However, traditional domain adaptation methods often struggle to bridge the domain gap when synthetic images lack the complex textures and visual patterns of real samples. In this work, we adapt the Inversion-Based Style Transfer (InST) framework originally designed for artistic style transfer to biomedical microscopy images. Our method combines latent-space Adaptive Instance Normalization with stochastic inversion in a diffusion model to transfer the style from real fluorescence microscopy images to synthetic ones, while weakly preserving content structure.
  We evaluate the effectiveness of our InST-based synthetic dataset for downstream cell counting by pre-training and fine-tuning EfficientNet-B0 models on various data sources, including real data, hard-coded synthetic data, and the public Cell200-s dataset. Models trained with our InST-synthesized images achieve up to 37\% lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) compared to models trained on hard-coded synthetic data, and a 52\% reduction in MAE compared to models trained on Cell200-s (from 53.70 to 25.95 MAE). Notably, our approach also outperforms models trained on real data alone (25.95 vs. 27.74 MAE). Further improvements are achieved when combining InST-synthesized data with lightweight domain adaptation techniques such as DACS with CutMix. These findings demonstrate that InST-based style transfer most effectively reduces the domain gap between synthetic and real microscopy data. Our approach offers a scalable path for enhancing cell counting performance while minimizing manual labeling effort.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Video matting remains limited by the scale and realism of existing datasets. While leveraging segmentation data can enhance semantic stability, the lack of effective boundary supervision often leads to segmentation-like mattes lacking fine details. To this end, we introduce a learned Matting Quality Evaluator (MQE) that assesses semantic and boundary quality of alpha mattes without ground truth. It produces a pixel-wise evaluation map that identifies reliable and erroneous regions, enabling fine-grained quality assessment. The MQE scales up video matting in two ways: (1) as an online matting-quality feedback during training to suppress erroneous regions, providing comprehensive supervision, and (2) as an offline selection module for data curation, improving annotation quality by combining the strengths of leading video and image matting models. This process allows us to build a large-scale real-world video matting dataset, VMReal, containing 28K clips and 2.4M frames. To handle large appearance variations in long videos, we introduce a reference-frame training strategy that incorporates long-range frames beyond the local window for effective training. Our MatAnyone 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, surpassing prior methods across all metrics.

Abstract: Accurately quantifying vitiligo extent in routine clinical photographs is crucial for longitudinal monitoring of treatment response. We propose a trustworthy, frequency-aware segmentation framework built on three synergistic pillars: (1) a data-efficient training strategy combining domain-adaptive pre-training on the ISIC 2019 dataset with an ROI-constrained dual-task loss to suppress background noise; (2) an architectural refinement via a ConvNeXt V2-based encoder enhanced with a novel High-Frequency Spectral Gating (HFSG) module and stem-skip connections to capture subtle textures; and (3) a clinical trust mechanism employing K-fold ensemble and Test-Time Augmentation (TTA) to generate pixel-wise uncertainty maps. Extensive validation on an expert-annotated clinical cohort demonstrates superior performance, achieving a Dice score of 85.05% and significantly reducing boundary error (95% Hausdorff Distance improved from 44.79 px to 29.95 px), consistently outperforming strong CNN (ResNet-50 and UNet++) and Transformer (MiT-B5) baselines. Notably, our framework demonstrates high reliability with zero catastrophic failures and provides interpretable entropy maps to identify ambiguous regions for clinician review. Our approach suggests that the proposed framework establishes a robust and reliable standard for automated vitiligo assessment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Reality is a dance between rigid constraints and deformable structures. For video models, that means generating motion that preserves fidelity as well as structure. Despite progress in diffusion models, producing realistic structure-preserving motion remains challenging, especially for articulated and deformable objects such as humans and animals. Scaling training data alone, so far, has failed to resolve physically implausible transitions. Existing approaches rely on conditioning with noisy motion representations, such as optical flow or skeletons extracted using an external imperfect model. To address these challenges, we introduce an algorithm to distill structure-preserving motion priors from an autoregressive video tracking model (SAM2) into a bidirectional video diffusion model (CogVideoX). With our method, we train SAM2VideoX, which contains two innovations: (1) a bidirectional feature fusion module that extracts global structure-preserving motion priors from a recurrent model like SAM2; (2) a Local Gram Flow loss that aligns how local features move together. Experiments on VBench and in human studies show that SAM2VideoX delivers consistent gains (+2.60\% on VBench, 21-22\% lower FVD, and 71.4\% human preference) over prior baselines. Specifically, on VBench, we achieve 95.51\%, surpassing REPA (92.91\%) by 2.60\%, and reduce FVD to 360.57, a 21.20\% and 22.46\% improvement over REPA- and LoRA-finetuning, respectively.

TL;DR: V-RGBX 是首个端到端的内在本征感知视频编辑框架，能够联合解耦与合成视频的固有属性（如反照率、法线、材质和辐照度），通过关键帧进行基于物理的编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以往的大规模视频生成模型已能建模真实场景的外观与光照交互，但缺少能够在闭环中联合理解、利用并支持可编辑内在场景属性的框架。因此，需要开发一个既能够进行视频逆渲染将视频分解为内在通道，又能从内在表征进行合成，并支持基于关键帧的直观物理编辑的系统。

Method: V-RGBX 通过交错调节机制实现三合一能力：1) 视频逆渲染为内在通道（RGBX），2) 从内在本征表征合成逼真视频，3) 以内在通道为条件进行关键帧视频编辑。该方法依托用户选择的关键帧实现对任意内在模态的灵活操控，保证编辑在时间上的一致性并基于物理传播。

Result: 大量的定性与定量实验表明，V-RGBX 能生成时间一致、逼真的视频，并将关键帧编辑以物理合理的方式传播到整个序列，在物体外观编辑和场景级重新打光等多种应用上超越了先前方法。

Conclusion: V-RGBX 首次实现了视频内在属性感知的端到端编辑，通过联合逆渲染、合成和基于关键帧的编辑，提供了一个物理基础强、操作直观且效果逼真的视频编辑框架，为未来视频内容创作与视觉特效开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have shown remarkable potential in modeling photorealistic appearance and lighting interactions in real-world scenes. However, a closed-loop framework that jointly understands intrinsic scene properties (e.g., albedo, normal, material, and irradiance), leverages them for video synthesis, and supports editable intrinsic representations remains unexplored. We present V-RGBX, the first end-to-end framework for intrinsic-aware video editing. V-RGBX unifies three key capabilities: (1) video inverse rendering into intrinsic channels, (2) photorealistic video synthesis from these intrinsic representations, and (3) keyframe-based video editing conditioned on intrinsic channels. At the core of V-RGBX is an interleaved conditioning mechanism that enables intuitive, physically grounded video editing through user-selected keyframes, supporting flexible manipulation of any intrinsic modality. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results show that V-RGBX produces temporally consistent, photorealistic videos while propagating keyframe edits across sequences in a physically plausible manner. We demonstrate its effectiveness in diverse applications, including object appearance editing and scene-level relighting, surpassing the performance of prior methods.

Conclusion: 提出的方法扩展了基于光栅化的3D高斯渲染，通过时刻基透射率计算实现了高质量的半透明物体渲染，避免了光线追踪的开销，为复杂场景渲染提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The recent success of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has reshaped novel view synthesis by enabling fast optimization and real-time rendering of high-quality radiance fields. However, it relies on simplified, order-dependent alpha blending and coarse approximations of the density integral within the rasterizer, thereby limiting its ability to render complex, overlapping semi-transparent objects. In this paper, we extend rasterization-based rendering of 3D Gaussian representations with a novel method for high-fidelity transmittance computation, entirely avoiding the need for ray tracing or per-pixel sample sorting. Building on prior work in moment-based order-independent transparency, our key idea is to characterize the density distribution along each camera ray with a compact and continuous representation based on statistical moments. To this end, we analytically derive and compute a set of per-pixel moments from all contributing 3D Gaussians. From these moments, a continuous transmittance function is reconstructed for each ray, which is then independently sampled within each Gaussian. As a result, our method bridges the gap between rasterization and physical accuracy by modeling light attenuation in complex translucent media, significantly improving overall reconstruction and rendering quality.

Abstract: Computer use agents (CUAs) can operate real-world digital interfaces but remain difficult to train due to the high cost of graphical user interface (GUI) interaction and the scarcity of high-quality trajectory data. Existing datasets rely on human demonstrations, limiting scalability. A natural alternative is to synthesize data from strong CUAs, yet their rollouts are highly noisy, with incorrect or suboptimal actions consisting a large proportion of the steps, making naive imitation ineffective. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a scalable data synthesis pipeline that transforms noisy rollouts into reliable supervision without human annotation. The core idea is step-level filtering, which evaluates actions individually to retain only correct steps, complemented by reasoning augmentation for improved planning. Using this pipeline, we construct WebSTAR, a dataset of 13.3K trajectories and 100K graded, reasoning-rich steps synthesized from OpenAI's computer-use-preview model. We train Qwen-2.5-VL-Instruct models (7B and 32B) on WebSTAR. On WebVoyager, our 7B model surpasses SoTA open-source CUA model UI-TARS-1.5-7B by more than 15% with only supervised finetuning. Building on step-level grading, we further create WebSCORE, a dataset of graded step-level actions, and train StepRM, a 7B multimodal reward model distilled from o4-mini, which matches its grading quality while being far more efficient to deploy at scale. Our results establish step-level filtering as a key principle for scalable CUA training and construct two new datasets (WebSTAR, WebSCORE) and a lightweight reward model (StepRM) as practical tools to advance robust and efficient CUAs.

Abstract: Accurate and early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) can benefit from integrating complementary information from multiple modalities, mirroring clinical practice. However, conventional fusion approaches often rely on simple concatenation of features, which cannot adaptively balance the contributions of biomarkers such as amyloid PET and MRI across brain regions. In this work, we propose MREF-AD, a Multimodal Regional Expert Fusion model for AD diagnosis. It is a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that models meso-scale brain regions in each modality as an independent expert and employs two-level gating networks to learn subject-specific fusion weights. Beyond improving diagnostic performance, MREF-AD provides modality- and region-level insight into how structural and molecular imaging jointly contribute to disease diagnosis. Using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), MREF-AD achieves state-of-the-art performance over baselines while providing enhanced interpretability of brain region-specific biomarker relevance, underscoring its utility as a general framework for adaptive and interpretable multimodal fusion in neuroimaging.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have demonstrated remarkable success in scaling neural networks, yet their application to continual learning remains fundamentally limited by a critical vulnerability: the learned gating network itself suffers from catastrophic forgetting. We introduce Mixture of Bidders (MoB), a novel framework that reconceptualizes expert routing as a decentralized economic mechanism. MoB replaces learned gating networks with Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auctions, where experts compete for each data batch by bidding their true cost -- a principled combination of execution cost (predicted loss) and forgetting cost (Elastic Weight Consolidation penalty). This game-theoretic approach provides three key advantages: (1) {stateless routing that is immune to catastrophic forgetting, (2) \textbf{truthful bidding} guaranteed by dominant-strategy incentive compatibility, and (3) emergent specialization without explicit task boundaries. On Split-MNIST benchmarks, MoB achieves 88.77% average accuracy compared to 19.54% for Gated MoE and 27.96% for Monolithic EWC, representing a 4.5 times improvement over the strongest baseline. We further extend MoB with autonomous self-monitoring experts that detect their own knowledge consolidation boundaries, eliminating the need for explicit task demarcation.

Abstract: Objective: Sepsis is a life-threatening condition caused by severe infection leading to acute organ dysfunction. This study proposes a data-driven metric and a continuous reward function to optimize personalized heparin therapy in surgical sepsis patients. Methods: Data from the MIMIC-IV v1.0 and eICU v2.0 databases were used for model development and evaluation. The training cohort consisted of abdominal surgery patients receiving unfractionated heparin (UFH) after postoperative sepsis onset. We introduce a new RL-based framework: converting the discrete SOFA score to a continuous cxSOFA for more nuanced state and reward functions; Second, defining "good" or "bad" strategies based on cxSOFA by a stepwise manner; Third, proposing a Treatment Effect Comparison Matrix (TECM), analogous to a confusion matrix for classification tasks, to evaluate the treatment strategies. We applied different RL algorithms, Q-Learning, DQN, DDQN, BCQ and CQL to optimize the treatment and comprehensively evaluated the framework. Results: Among the AI-derived strategies, the cxSOFA-CQL model achieved the best performance, reducing mortality from 1.83% to 0.74% with the average hospital stay from 11.11 to 9.42 days. TECM demonstrated consistent outcomes across models, highlighting robustness. Conclusion: The proposed RL framework enables interpretable and robust optimization of heparin therapy in surgical sepsis. Continuous cxSOFA scoring and TECM-based evaluation provide nuanced treatment assessment, showing promise for improving clinical outcomes and decision-support reliability.

Abstract: Effective human-agent interaction (HAI) relies on accurate and adaptive perception of human emotional states. While multimodal deep learning models - leveraging facial expressions, speech, and textual cues - offer high accuracy in emotion recognition, their training and maintenance are often computationally intensive and inflexible to modality changes. In this work, we propose a novel multi-agent framework for training multimodal emotion recognition systems, where each modality encoder and the fusion classifier operate as autonomous agents coordinated by a central supervisor. This architecture enables modular integration of new modalities (e.g., audio features via emotion2vec), seamless replacement of outdated components, and reduced computational overhead during training. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through a proof-of-concept implementation supporting vision, audio, and text modalities, with the classifier serving as a shared decision-making agent.

Abstract: Generating precise 3D molecular geometries is crucial for drug discovery and material science. While prior efforts leverage 1D representations like SELFIES to ensure molecular validity, they fail to fully exploit the rich chemical knowledge entangled within 1D models, leading to a disconnect between 1D syntactic generation and 3D geometric realization. To bridge this gap, we propose MolSculpt, a novel framework that "sculpts" 3D molecular geometries from chemical syntax. MolSculpt is built upon a frozen 1D molecular foundation model and a 3D molecular diffusion model. We introduce a set of learnable queries to extract inherent chemical knowledge from the foundation model, and a trainable projector then injects this cross-modal information into the conditioning space of the diffusion model to guide the 3D geometry generation. In this way, our model deeply integrates 1D latent chemical knowledge into the 3D generation process through end-to-end optimization. Experiments demonstrate that MolSculpt achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in \textit{de novo} 3D molecule generation and conditional 3D molecule generation, showing superior 3D fidelity and stability on both the GEOM-DRUGS and QM9 datasets. Code is available at https://github.com/SakuraTroyChen/MolSculpt.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法在处理部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程时面临困难，因为输出过程是非马尔可夫的，导致策略改进步骤在不同阶段相互依赖。无记忆和有限记忆策略虽然更实用，但将经典方法（如策略迭代）扩展到此设置仍具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法家族提供了一种有效的方法，用于在POMDP中学习无记忆和有限记忆策略，实现了显著的计算效率提升，并在模型基于和无模型设置下均表现出优异的性能。

Abstract: Memoryless and finite-memory policies offer a practical alternative for solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), as they operate directly in the output space rather than in the high-dimensional belief space. However, extending classical methods such as policy iteration to this setting remains difficult; the output process is non-Markovian, making policy-improvement steps interdependent across stages. We introduce a new family of monotonically improving policy-iteration algorithms that alternate between single-stage output-based policy improvements and policy evaluations according to a prescribed periodic pattern. We show that this family admits optimal patterns that maximize a natural computational-efficiency index, and we identify the simplest pattern with minimal period. Building on this structure, we further develop a model-free variant that estimates values from data and learns memoryless policies directly. Across several POMDPs examples, our method achieves significant computational speedups over policy-gradient baselines and recent specialized algorithms in both model-based and model-free settings.

Conclusion: 需进一步开发与临床实际对齐、能有效处理歧义的ECG诊断学习框架，该研究为未来的鲁棒性ECG模型发展提供了方向性指引。

Abstract: Label ambiguity is an inherent problem in real-world electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis, arising from overlapping conditions and diagnostic disagreement. However, current ECG models are trained under the assumption of clean and non-ambiguous annotations, which limits both the development and the meaningful evaluation of models under real-world conditions. Although Partial Label Learning (PLL) frameworks are designed to learn from ambiguous labels, their effectiveness in medical time-series domains, ECG in particular, remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study of PLL methods for ECG diagnosis. We adapt nine PLL algorithms to multi-label ECG diagnosis and evaluate them using a diverse set of clinically motivated ambiguity generation strategies, capturing both unstructured (e.g., random) and structured ambiguities (e.g., cardiologist-derived similarities, treatment relationships, and diagnostic taxonomies). Our experiments on the PTB-XL and Chapman datasets demonstrate that PLL methods vary substantially in their robustness to different types and degrees of ambiguity. Through extensive analysis, we identify key limitations of current PLL approaches in clinical settings and outline future directions for developing robust and clinically aligned ambiguity-aware learning frameworks for ECG diagnosis.

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for improving the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) by allocating additional computation at inference, yet its application to multimodal systems such as Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remains underexplored. In this work, we present a systematic empirical study of inference time reasoning methods applied across both open-source and closed-source VLMs on different benchmarks. Our results reveal that while closed-source models consistently benefit from structured reasoning and iterative Self-Refinement, open-source VLMs show inconsistent behavior: external verification provides the most reliable gains, whereas iterative refinement often degrades performance. We further find that the effectiveness of TTS is dataset-dependent, yielding clear improvements on multi-step reasoning tasks but offering only limited gains on perception-focused benchmarks. These findings demonstrate that TTS is not a universal solution and must be tailored to both model capabilities and task characteristics, motivating future work on adaptive TTS strategies and multimodal reward models.

Abstract: Fairness and action smoothness are two crucial considerations in many online optimization problems, but they have yet to be addressed simultaneously. In this paper, we study a new and challenging setting of fairness-regularized smoothed online convex optimization with switching costs. First, to highlight the fundamental challenges introduced by the long-term fairness regularizer evaluated based on the entire sequence of actions, we prove that even without switching costs, no online algorithms can possibly achieve a sublinear regret or finite competitive ratio compared to the offline optimal algorithm as the problem episode length $T$ increases. Then, we propose FairOBD (Fairness-regularized Online Balanced Descent), which reconciles the tension between minimizing the hitting cost, switching cost, and fairness cost. Concretely, FairOBD decomposes the long-term fairness cost into a sequence of online costs by introducing an auxiliary variable and then leverages the auxiliary variable to regularize the online actions for fair outcomes. Based on a new approach to account for switching costs, we prove that FairOBD offers a worst-case asymptotic competitive ratio against a novel benchmark -- the optimal offline algorithm with parameterized constraints -- by considering $T\to\infty$. Finally, we run trace-driven experiments of dynamic computing resource provisioning for socially responsible AI inference to empirically evaluate FairOBD, showing that FairOBD can effectively reduce the total fairness-regularized cost and better promote fair outcomes compared to existing baseline solutions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for parameterizing physical fields, yet they often suffer from spectral bias and the computational expense of non-convex optimization. We introduce the Vekua Layer (VL), a differentiable spectral method grounded in the classical theory of Generalized Analytic Functions. By restricting the hypothesis space to the kernel of the governing differential operator -- specifically utilizing Harmonic and Fourier-Bessel bases -- the VL transforms the learning task from iterative gradient descent to a strictly convex least-squares problem solved via linear projection. We evaluate the VL against Sinusoidal Representation Networks (SIRENs) on homogeneous elliptic Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Our results demonstrate that the VL achieves machine precision ($\text{MSE} \approx 10^{-33}$) on exact reconstruction tasks and exhibits superior stability in the presence of incoherent sensor noise ($\text{MSE} \approx 0.03$), effectively acting as a physics-informed spectral filter. Furthermore, we show that the VL enables "holographic" extrapolation of global fields from partial boundary data via analytic continuation, a capability absent in standard coordinate-based approximations.

Abstract: Analyzing and visualizing scientific ensemble datasets with high dimensionality and complexity poses significant challenges. Dimensionality reduction techniques and autoencoders are powerful tools for extracting features, but they often struggle with such high-dimensional data. This paper presents an enhanced autoencoder framework that incorporates a clustering loss, based on the soft silhouette score, alongside a contrastive loss to improve the visualization and interpretability of ensemble datasets. First, EfficientNetV2 is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled portions of the scientific ensemble datasets. By jointly optimizing the reconstruction, clustering, and contrastive objectives, our method encourages similar data points to group together while separating distinct clusters in the latent space. UMAP is subsequently applied to this latent representation to produce 2D projections, which are evaluated using the silhouette score. Multiple types of autoencoders are evaluated and compared based on their ability to extract meaningful features. Experiments on two scientific ensemble datasets - channel structures in soil derived from Markov chain Monte Carlo, and droplet-on-film impact dynamics - show that models incorporating clustering or contrastive loss marginally outperform the baseline approaches.

Abstract: Modern cities are increasingly reliant on data-driven insights to support decision making in areas such as transportation, public safety and environmental impact. However, city-level data often exists in heterogeneous formats, collected independently by local agencies with diverse objectives and standards. Despite their numerous, wide-ranging, and uniformly consumable nature, national-level datasets exhibit significant heterogeneity and multi-modality. This research proposes a heterogeneous data pipeline that performs cross-domain data fusion over time-varying, spatial-varying and spatial-varying time-series datasets. We aim to address complex urban problems across multiple domains and localities by harnessing the rich information over 50 data sources. Specifically, our data-learning module integrates homophily from spatial-varying dataset into graph-learning, embedding information of various localities into models. We demonstrate the generalizability and flexibility of the framework through five real-world observations using a variety of publicly accessible datasets (e.g., ride-share, traffic crash, and crime reports) collected from multiple cities. The results show that our proposed framework demonstrates strong predictive performance while requiring minimal reconfiguration when transferred to new localities or domains. This research advances the goal of building data-informed urban systems in a scalable way, addressing one of the most pressing challenges in smart city analytics.

Abstract: Current benchmarks that test LLMs on static, already-solved problems (e.g., math word problems) effectively demonstrated basic capability acquisition. The natural progression has been toward larger, more comprehensive and challenging collections of static problems, an approach that inadvertently constrains the kinds of advances we can measure and incentivize. To address this limitation, we argue for progress-oriented benchmarks, problem environments whose objectives are themselves the core targets of scientific progress, so that achieving state of the art on the benchmark advances the field. As a introductory step, we instantiate an environment based on the NanoGPT speedrun. The environment standardizes a dataset slice, a reference model and training harness, and rich telemetry, with run-time verification and anti-gaming checks. Evaluation centers on the scientific delta achieved: best-attained loss and the efficiency frontier. Using this environment, we achieve a new state-of-the-art training time, improving upon the previous record by 3 seconds, and qualitatively observe the emergence of novel algorithmic ideas. Moreover, comparisons between models and agents remain possible, but they are a means, not the end; the benchmark's purpose is to catalyze reusable improvements to the language modeling stack. With this release, the overarching goal is to seed a community shift from static problem leaderboards to test-time research on open-ended yet measurable scientific problems. In this new paradigm, progress on the benchmark is progress on the science, thus reframing "benchmarking" as a vehicle for scientific advancement.

Abstract: Learning controller parameters from closed-loop data has been shown to improve closed-loop performance. Bayesian optimization, a widely used black-box and sample-efficient learning method, constructs a probabilistic surrogate of the closed-loop performance from few experiments and uses it to select informative controller parameters. However, it typically struggles with dense high-dimensional controller parameterizations, as they may appear, for example, in tuning model predictive controllers, because standard surrogate models fail to capture the structure of such spaces. This work suggests that the use of Bayesian neural networks as surrogate models may help to mitigate this limitation. Through a comparison between Gaussian processes with Matern kernels, finite-width Bayesian neural networks, and infinite-width Bayesian neural networks on a cart-pole task, we find that Bayesian neural network surrogate models achieve faster and more reliable convergence of the closed-loop cost and enable successful optimization of parameterizations with hundreds of dimensions. Infinite-width Bayesian neural networks also maintain performance in settings with more than one thousand parameters, whereas Matern-kernel Gaussian processes rapidly lose effectiveness. These results indicate that Bayesian neural network surrogate models may be suitable for learning dense high-dimensional controller parameterizations and offer practical guidance for selecting surrogate models in learning-based controller design.

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning uses governing ordinary and/or partial differential equations to train neural networks to represent the solution field. Like any machine learning problem, the choice of activation function influences the characteristics and performance of the solution obtained from physics-informed training. Several studies have compared common activation functions on benchmark differential equations, and have unanimously found that the rectified linear unit (ReLU) is outperformed by competitors such as the sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent, and swish activation functions. In this work, we diagnose the poor performance of ReLU on physics-informed machine learning problems. While it is well-known that the piecewise linear form of ReLU prevents it from being used on second-order differential equations, we show that ReLU fails even on variational problems involving only first derivatives. We identify the cause of this failure as second derivatives of the activation, which are taken not in the formulation of the loss, but in the process of training. Namely, we show that automatic differentiation in PyTorch fails to characterize derivatives of discontinuous fields, which causes the gradient of the physics-informed loss to be mis-specified, thus explaining the poor performance of ReLU.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Memorization in large-scale text-to-image diffusion models poses significant security and intellectual property risks, enabling adversarial attribute extraction and the unauthorized reproduction of sensitive or proprietary features. While conventional dememorization techniques, such as regularization and data filtering, limit overfitting to specific training examples, they fail to systematically prevent the internalization of prohibited concept-level features. Simply discarding all images containing a sensitive feature wastes invaluable training data, necessitating a method for selective unlearning at the concept level.
  To address this, we introduce a Gradient Projection Framework designed to enforce a stringent requirement of concept-level feature exclusion. Our defense operates during backpropagation by systematically identifying and excising training signals aligned with embeddings of prohibited attributes. Specifically, we project each gradient update onto the orthogonal complement of the sensitive feature's embedding space, thereby zeroing out its influence on the model's weights. Our method integrates seamlessly into standard diffusion model training pipelines and complements existing defenses. We analyze our method against an adversary aiming for feature extraction. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework drastically reduces memorization while rigorously preserving generation quality and semantic fidelity. By reframing memorization control as selective learning, our approach establishes a new paradigm for IP-safe and privacy-preserving generative AI.

Abstract: Addressing selection bias in latent variable causal discovery is important yet underexplored, largely due to a lack of suitable statistical tools: While various tools beyond basic conditional independencies have been developed to handle latent variables, none have been adapted for selection bias. We make an attempt by studying rank constraints, which, as a generalization to conditional independence constraints, exploits the ranks of covariance submatrices in linear Gaussian models. We show that although selection can significantly complicate the joint distribution, interestingly, the ranks in the biased covariance matrices still preserve meaningful information about both causal structures and selection mechanisms. We provide a graph-theoretic characterization of such rank constraints. Using this tool, we demonstrate that the one-factor model, a classical latent variable model, can be identified under selection bias. Simulations and real-world experiments confirm the effectiveness of using our rank constraints.

Method: 使用可逆软冻结机制，在滑动注意力窗口内识别低重要性token时临时暂停其KV更新，将其保存在非GPU存储器中，需要时再恢复更新。结合亚线性冻结调度策略，避免过度压缩。

Result: 在LLaMA-3 8B模型上实验显示，活跃KV缓存大小减少55-67%，同时保持生成质量并通过了needle-in-haystack检索测试。

Conclusion: 该方法无需训练、架构无关，为大语言模型在内存受限环境下的长上下文部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: We present Adaptive Soft Rolling KV Freeze with Entropy-Guided Recovery (ASR-KF-EGR), a training-free inference-time framework for efficient large language model generation. Our method introduces a reversible soft-freeze mechanism that temporarily suspends key-value (KV) updates for low-importance tokens identified within a sliding attention window. Unlike eviction-based approaches that permanently discard context, ASR-KF-EGR preserves all tokens in off-GPU storage and restores them on demand. We extend the framework with sublinear freeze scheduling, where freeze duration grows sublinearly with repeated low-importance detections, preventing over-aggressive compression. Preliminary experiments on LLaMA-3 8B demonstrate 55-67% reduction in active KV cache size while maintaining generation quality and passing needle-in-haystack retrieval tests. The method is architecture-agnostic, requires no fine-tuning, and provides a practical solution for memory-constrained deployment of long-context LLMs.

Abstract: Time-series data is critical across many scientific and industrial domains, including environmental analysis, agriculture, transportation, and finance. However, mining insights from this data typically requires deep domain expertise, a process that is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose \textbf{Insight Miner}, a large-scale multimodal model (LMM) designed to generate high-quality, comprehensive time-series descriptions enriched with domain-specific knowledge. To facilitate this, we introduce \textbf{TS-Insights}\footnote{Available at \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/zhykoties/time-series-language-alignment}{https://huggingface.co/datasets/zhykoties/time-series-language-alignment}.}, the first general-domain dataset for time series and language alignment. TS-Insights contains 100k time-series windows sampled from 20 forecasting datasets. We construct this dataset using a novel \textbf{agentic workflow}, where we use statistical tools to extract features from raw time series before synthesizing them into coherent trend descriptions with GPT-4. Following instruction tuning on TS-Insights, Insight Miner outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal models, such as LLaVA \citep{liu2023llava} and GPT-4, in generating time-series descriptions and insights. Our findings suggest a promising direction for leveraging LMMs in time series analysis, and serve as a foundational step toward enabling LLMs to interpret time series as a native input modality.

Abstract: Programmable Logic Controllers (PLCs) are critical components in Industrial Control Systems (ICSs). Their potential exposure to external world makes them susceptible to cyber-attacks. Existing detection methods against controller logic attacks use either specification-based or learnt models. However, specification-based models require experts' manual efforts or access to PLC's source code, while machine learning-based models often fall short of providing explanation for their decisions. We design SRLR -- a it Symbolic Regression based Logic Recovery} solution to identify the logic of a PLC based only on its inputs and outputs. The recovered logic is used to generate explainable rules for detecting controller logic attacks. SRLR enhances the latest deep symbolic regression methods using the following ICS-specific properties: (1) some important ICS control logic is best represented in frequency domain rather than time domain; (2) an ICS controller can operate in multiple modes, each using different logic, where mode switches usually do not happen frequently; (3) a robust controller usually filters out outlier inputs as ICS sensor data can be noisy; and (4) with the above factors captured, the degree of complexity of the formulas is reduced, making effective search possible. Thanks to these enhancements, SRLR consistently outperforms all existing methods in a variety of ICS settings that we evaluate. In terms of the recovery accuracy, SRLR's gain can be as high as 39% in some challenging environment. We also evaluate SRLR on a distribution grid containing hundreds of voltage regulators, demonstrating its stability in handling large-scale, complex systems with varied configurations.

Result: 1. 噪声相关性较小的模型给出更好的准确率；2.生成多项式的权重对解码器准确率影响甚微；3.Golay码(需要23个数据量子比特，码距7)比环面码(需要50个数据量子比特，码距5)实现了更高的解码准确率。

Conclusion: 通过Transformer实现量子纠错，可能使Golay码能更高效地实现容错量子计算。Golay码在更少量子比特资源下展现出优于环面码的性能，表明经典编码方法在量子纠错中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Quantum computers have the possibility of a much reduced calculation load compared with classical computers in specific problems. Quantum error correction (QEC) is vital for handling qubits, which are vulnerable to external noise. In QEC, actual errors are predicted from the results of syndrome measurements by stabilizer generators, in place of making direct measurements of the data qubits. Here, we propose Quantum Golay code Error Correction (QGEC), a QEC method using Golay code, which is an efficient coding method in classical information theory. We investigated our method's ability in decoding calculations with the Transformer. We evaluated the accuracy of the decoder in a code space defined by the generative polynomials with three different weights sets and three noise models with different correlations of bit-flip error and phase-flip error. Furthermore, under a noise model following a discrete uniform distribution, we compared the decoding performance of Transformer decoders with identical architectures trained respectively on Golay and toric codes. The results showed that the noise model with the smaller correlation gave better accuracy, while the weights of the generative polynomials had little effect on the accuracy of the decoder. In addition, they showed that Golay code requiring 23 data qubits and having a code distance of 7 achieved higher decoding accuracy than toric code which requiring 50 data qubits and having a code distance of 5. This suggests that implementing quantum error correction using a Transformer may enable the Golay code to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation more efficiently.

Motivation: 当前多模态智能体评估分散在孤立测试集上，难以衡量基础模型是否真正超越训练分布实现泛化。需要统一基准来系统评估模型跨域通用性。

Method: 构建MultiNet v1.0基准，覆盖6个核心能力域，对GPT-5、Pi0、Magma等主流模型进行跨域评估，分析其在未见域、新模态和跨域任务迁移时的表现差异。

Result: 所有模型在未见域、陌生模态或跨域任务上都出现显著性能下降，表现为模态错位、输出格式不稳定和跨域知识退化。没有模型展现出稳定的跨域通用性。

Conclusion: 当前基础模型的实际能力与通用智能目标之间存在明显差距。MultiNet v1.0为诊断这些差距和指导未来通用智能体开发提供了标准化评估框架。

Abstract: Generalist multimodal agents are expected to unify perception, language, and control - operating robustly across diverse real world domains. However, current evaluation practices remain fragmented across isolated benchmarks, making it difficult to assess whether today's foundation models truly generalize beyond their training distributions. We introduce MultiNet v1.0, a unified benchmark for measuring the cross domain generality of vision language models (VLMs) and vision language action models (VLAs) across six foundational capability regimes. Visual grounding, spatial reasoning, tool use, physical commonsense, multi agent coordination, and continuous robot control. Evaluating GPT 5, Pi0, and Magma, we find that no model demonstrates consistent generality. All exhibit substantial degradation on unseen domains, unfamiliar modalities, or cross domain task shifts despite strong performance within their training distributions.These failures manifest as modality misalignment, output format instability, and catastrophic knowledge degradation under domain transfer.Our findings reveal a persistent gap between the aspiration of generalist intelligence and the actual capabilities of current foundation models.MultiNet v1.0 provides a standardized evaluation substrate for diagnosing these gaps and guiding the development of future generalist agents.Code, data, and leaderboards are publicly available.

Abstract: Accurate core loss modeling is critical for the design of high-efficiency power electronic systems. Traditional core loss modeling methods have limitations in prediction accuracy. To advance this field, the IEEE Power Electronics Society launched the MagNet Challenge in 2023, the first international competition focused on data-driven power electronics design methods, aiming to uncover complex loss patterns in magnetic components through a data-driven paradigm. Although purely data-driven models demonstrate strong fitting performance, their interpretability and cross-distribution generalization capabilities remain limited. To address these issues, this paper proposes a hybrid model, SEPI-TFPNet, which integrates empirical models with deep learning. The physical-prior submodule employs a spectral entropy discrimination mechanism to select the most suitable empirical model under different excitation waveforms. The data-driven submodule incorporates convolutional neural networks, multi-head attention mechanisms, and bidirectional long short-term memory networks to extract flux-density time-series features. An adaptive feature fusion module is introduced to improve multimodal feature interaction and integration. Using the MagNet dataset containing various magnetic materials, this paper evaluates the proposed method and compares it with 21 representative models from the 2023 challenge and three advanced methods from 2024-2025. The results show that the proposed method achieves improved modeling accuracy and robustness.

Conclusion: DAPO通过设计结构感知的编译器传递排序框架，能够为不同设计生成定制化的优化策略，显著提升HLS性能和硬件加速效果。

Abstract: High-Level Synthesis (HLS) tools are widely adopted in FPGA-based domain-specific accelerator design. However, existing tools rely on fixed optimization strategies inherited from software compilations, limiting their effectiveness. Tailoring optimization strategies to specific designs requires deep semantic understanding, accurate hardware metric estimation, and advanced search algorithms -- capabilities that current approaches lack.
  We propose DAPO, a design structure-aware pass ordering framework that extracts program semantics from control and data flow graphs, employs contrastive learning to generate rich embeddings, and leverages an analytical model for accurate hardware metric estimation. These components jointly guide a reinforcement learning agent to discover design-specific optimization strategies. Evaluations on classic HLS designs demonstrate that our end-to-end flow delivers a 2.36 speedup over Vitis HLS on average.

Abstract: Equivariant diffusion policies (EDPs) combine the generative expressivity of diffusion models with the strong generalization and sample efficiency afforded by geometric symmetries. While steering these policies with reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising mechanism for fine-tuning beyond demonstration data, directly applying standard (non-equivariant) RL can be sample-inefficient and unstable, as it ignores the symmetries that EDPs are designed to exploit. In this paper, we theoretically establish that the diffusion process of an EDP is equivariant, which in turn induces a group-invariant latent-noise MDP that is well-suited for equivariant diffusion steering. Building on this theory, we introduce a principled symmetry-aware steering framework and compare standard, equivariant, and approximately equivariant RL strategies through comprehensive experiments across tasks with varying degrees of symmetry. While we identify the practical boundaries of strict equivariance under symmetry breaking, we show that exploiting symmetry during the steering process yields substantial benefits-enhancing sample efficiency, preventing value divergence, and achieving strong policy improvements even when EDPs are trained from extremely limited demonstrations.

Abstract: High-precision scientific simulation faces a long-standing trade-off between computational efficiency and physical fidelity. To address this challenge, we propose NeuralOGCM, an ocean modeling framework that fuses differentiable programming with deep learning. At the core of NeuralOGCM is a fully differentiable dynamical solver, which leverages physics knowledge as its core inductive bias. The learnable physics integration captures large-scale, deterministic physical evolution, and transforms key physical parameters (e.g., diffusion coefficients) into learnable parameters, enabling the model to autonomously optimize its physical core via end-to-end training. Concurrently, a deep neural network learns to correct for subgrid-scale processes and discretization errors not captured by the physics model. Both components work in synergy, with their outputs integrated by a unified ODE solver. Experiments demonstrate that NeuralOGCM maintains long-term stability and physical consistency, significantly outperforming traditional numerical models in speed and pure AI baselines in accuracy. Our work paves a new path for building fast, stable, and physically-plausible models for scientific computing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了NSPO（零空间约束策略优化）方法，通过将安全策略梯度投影到通用任务零空间中，有效解决了LLM安全对齐中的能力遗忘问题，在保持核心能力的同时实现了优秀的安全性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在实际应用中的普及，确保其行为符合人类价值观和社会伦理变得至关重要。然而，传统的强化学习安全对齐方法通常会导致模型遗忘已学到的通用能力（即对齐税问题），这限制了安全对齐的实际应用效果。

Method: 提出了NSPO（Null-Space constrained Policy Optimization）框架，将安全策略梯度在几何上投影到通用任务的零空间中，从而在保证模型原始核心能力不被破坏的前提下，实现有效的安全对齐。理论证明了该方法能保持原始能力，同时保证安全对齐的有效下降方向。

Result: 大量实验表明NSPO显著优于现有方法，在数学、编码和指令跟随等通用任务上保持精度的同时，实现了最先进的安全性能。NSPO数据效率高，仅需PKU-SafeRLHF中40%的人类标注安全数据即可达到良好安全效果，无需大量混合通用任务数据。

Conclusion: NSPO为解决大语言模型安全对齐中的能力遗忘问题提供了一种有效的几何方法，能够在保持模型核心能力的同时实现优秀的安全性能，且具有较高的数据效率，为大语言模型的安全部署提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, it is important to ensure their behaviors align with human values, societal norms, and ethical principles. However, safety alignment under Reinforcement Learning (RL) often suffers from forgetting learned general abilities, which is also known as the alignment tax. To address this issue, we introduce Null-Space constrained Policy Optimization (NSPO), a novel RL framework for LLM safety alignment while preserving their core abilities. The safety policy gradients are geometrically projected into the null space of general tasks, thereby mitigating the safety alignment tax. In addition, we theoretically prove that NSPO preserves the model's original core capabilities, while still guaranteeing a descent direction for effective safety alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSPO outperforms existing methods by a large margin, achieving state-of-the-art safety performance without sacrificing accuracy on general tasks, including math, code, and instruction-following tasks. Notably, NSPO is data-efficient and only requires 40% of public human-annotated safety data from PKU-SafeRLHF to achieve promising safety performance, without a large amount of mixed general tasks data in existing alignment methods.

Motivation: 现实世界的时间序列预测中，有些异常事件有持续影响应该响应，有些短暂噪声应该忽略。标准的预测模型无法区分这两类异常，经常对噪声过度反应或错过持续分布变化。

Method: 提出Co-TSFA正则化框架，通过生成仅输入和输入-输出的数据增强来建模预测无关和预测相关异常，引入潜在输出对齐损失来关联表示变化和预测变化，使其对无关扰动保持鲁棒而对有意义分布变化保持敏感。

Result: 在Traffic和Electricity基准数据集及真实现金需求数据集上的实验表明，Co-TSFA在异常条件下显著提升性能，同时在正常数据上保持预测精度。

Conclusion: Co-TSFA提供了一种有效的正则化方法来区分对待不同类型的时间序列异常，提高了模型对异常事件的适应性，在真实世界应用中具有实用价值。GitHub代码库将在接受后公开。

Abstract: Time series forecasting predicts future values from past data. In real-world settings, some anomalous events have lasting effects and influence the forecast, while others are short-lived and should be ignored. Standard forecasting models fail to make this distinction, often either overreacting to noise or missing persistent shifts. We propose Co-TSFA (Contrastive Time Series Forecasting with Anomalies), a regularization framework that learns when to ignore anomalies and when to respond. Co-TSFA generates input-only and input-output augmentations to model forecast-irrelevant and forecast-relevant anomalies, and introduces a latent-output alignment loss that ties representation changes to forecast changes. This encourages invariance to irrelevant perturbations while preserving sensitivity to meaningful distributional shifts. Experiments on the Traffic and Electricity benchmarks, as well as on a real-world cash-demand dataset, demonstrate that Co-TSFA improves performance under anomalous conditions while maintaining accuracy on normal data. An anonymized GitHub repository with the implementation of Co-TSFA is provided and will be made public upon acceptance.

Abstract: We introduce sliced ReLU attention, a new attention mechanism that departs structurally from both softmax and ReLU-based alternatives. Instead of applying a nonlinearity to pairwise dot products, we operate on one-dimensional projections of key--query differences and leverage sorting to obtain quasi-linear complexity. This construction yields a differentiable, non-symmetric kernel that can be computed in O(n log(n)) through a sorting procedure, making it suitable for very long contexts. Beyond computational benefits, the model retains strong theoretical expressive power: we establish two in-context expressivity results, previously known for softmax attention, showing that sliced ReLU attention preserves the ability to perform nontrivial sequence-to-sequence disentangling tasks and satisfies a contextual universal approximation property. Finally, we illustrate the potential practical interest of this kernel in small-scale experiments.

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental unsupervised learning task for uncovering patterns in data. While Gaussian Blurring Mean Shift (GBMS) has proven effective for identifying arbitrarily shaped clusters in Euclidean space, it struggles with datasets exhibiting hierarchical or tree-like structures. In this work, we introduce HypeGBMS, a novel extension of GBMS to hyperbolic space. Our method replaces Euclidean computations with hyperbolic distances and employs Möbius-weighted means to ensure that all updates remain consistent with the geometry of the space. HypeGBMS effectively captures latent hierarchies while retaining the density-seeking behavior of GBMS. We provide theoretical insights into convergence and computational complexity, along with empirical results that demonstrate improved clustering quality in hierarchical datasets. This work bridges classical mean-shift clustering and hyperbolic representation learning, offering a principled approach to density-based clustering in curved spaces. Extensive experimental evaluations on $11$ real-world datasets demonstrate that HypeGBMS significantly outperforms conventional mean-shift clustering methods in non-Euclidean settings, underscoring its robustness and effectiveness.

Result: 确定顺序SFT-then-RL优于同步方法；在SFT稳定或轻度过拟合阶段开始RL能最大化最终上限；数据规模是主要决定因素，轨迹难度是倍增因子；SFT验证损失能有效选择最佳专家轨迹。

Conclusion: 研究成果为从专家轨迹中提取最大价值提供了操作性指导，建立了性能分解的理论框架，并提供了具体的规模化指导原则。

Abstract: While effective post-training integrates Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), the optimal mechanism for utilizing expert trajectories remains unresolved. We propose the Plasticity-Ceiling Framework to theoretically ground this landscape, decomposing performance into foundational SFT performance and the subsequent RL plasticity. Through extensive benchmarking, we establish the Sequential SFT-then-RL pipeline as the superior standard, overcoming the stability deficits of synchronized approaches. Furthermore, we derive precise scaling guidelines: (1) Transitioning to RL at the SFT Stable or Mild Overfitting Sub-phase maximizes the final ceiling by securing foundational SFT performance without compromising RL plasticity; (2) Refuting ``Less is More'' in the context of SFT-then-RL scaling, we demonstrate that Data Scale determines the primary post-training potential, while Trajectory Difficulty acts as a performance multiplier; and (3) Identifying that the Minimum SFT Validation Loss serves as a robust indicator for selecting the expert trajectories that maximize the final performance ceiling. Our findings provide actionable guidelines for maximizing the value extracted from expert trajectories.

Conclusion: AAS方法能有效提升VLA模型的泛化性能，通过原子动作切片使规划器更容易使用且策略更容易学习

Abstract: Current vision-language-action (VLA) models generalize poorly, particularly when tasks require new compositions of skills or objects. We introduce Atomic Action Slicing (AAS), a planner-aligned approach that decomposes long-horizon demonstrations into short, typed atomic actions that are easier for planners to use and policies to learn. Using LIBERO demonstrations, AAS produces a validated dataset of 2,124 atomic segments labeled with action type, temporal span, and confidence. A stronger segmenter (Gemini 2.5 Pro) closely matches planner-defined plans and remains robust under keyframe jitter, while smaller models perform worse on multi-object tasks. Fine-tuning CLIP-RT+ on our atomic dataset improves task success from 94.2% to 95.3% on LIBERO-Goal and 83.8% to 88.8% on LIBERO-Long.

Abstract: Recommendation system delivers substantial economic benefits by providing personalized predictions. Generative recommendation (GR) integrates LLMs to enhance the understanding of long user-item sequences. Despite employing attention-based architectures, GR's workload differs markedly from that of LLM serving. GR typically processes long prompt while producing short, fixed-length outputs, yet the computational cost of each decode phase is especially high due to the large beam width. In addition, since the beam search involves a vast item space, the sorting overhead becomes particularly time-consuming. We propose xGR, a GR-oriented serving system that meets strict low-latency requirements under highconcurrency scenarios. First, xGR unifies the processing of prefill and decode phases through staged computation and separated KV cache. Second, xGR enables early sorting termination and mask-based item filtering with data structure reuse. Third, xGR reconstructs the overall pipeline to exploit multilevel overlap and multi-stream parallelism. Our experiments with real-world recommendation service datasets demonstrate that xGR achieves at least 3.49x throughput compared to the state-of-the-art baseline under strict latency constraints.

These examples range from smooth closed-form benchmarks to challenging numerical integrals. Across all cases, the differential machine learning-based approach consistently outperforms standard architectures, achieving lower mean squared error, enhanced scalability, and improved sample efficiency.

Abstract: The performance of machine learning (ML) models often deteriorates when the underlying data distribution changes over time, a phenomenon known as data distribution drift. When this happens, ML models need to be retrained and redeployed. ML Operations (MLOps) is often manual, i.e., humans trigger the process of model retraining and redeployment. In this work, we present an automated MLOps pipeline designed to address neural network classifier retraining in response to significant data distribution changes. Our MLOps pipeline employs multi-criteria statistical techniques to detect distribution shifts and triggers model updates only when necessary, ensuring computational efficiency and resource optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through experiments on several benchmark anomaly detection data sets, showing significant improvements in model accuracy and robustness compared to traditional retraining strategies. Our work provides a foundation for deploying more reliable and adaptive ML systems in dynamic real-world settings, where data distribution changes are common.

Abstract: Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) models combine several kernels in supervised and unsupervised settings to integrate multiple data representations or sources, each represented by a different kernel. MKL seeks an optimal linear combination of base kernels that maximizes a generalized performance measure under a regularization constraint. Various norms have been used to regularize the kernel weights, including $l1$, $l2$ and $lp$, as well as the "elastic-net" penalty, which combines $l1$- and $l2$-norm to promote both sparsity and the selection of correlated kernels. This property makes elastic-net regularized MKL (ENMKL) especially valuable when model interpretability is critical and kernels capture correlated information, such as in neuroimaging. Previous ENMKL methods have followed a two-stage procedure: fix kernel weights, train a support vector machine (SVM) with the weighted kernel, and then update the weights via gradient descent, cutting-plane methods, or surrogate functions. Here, we introduce an alternative ENMKL formulation that yields a simple analytical update for the kernel weights. We derive explicit algorithms for both SVM and kernel ridge regression (KRR) under this framework, and implement them in the open-source Pattern Recognition for Neuroimaging Toolbox (PRoNTo). We evaluate these ENMKL algorithms against $l1$-norm MKL and against SVM (or KRR) trained on the unweighted sum of kernels across three neuroimaging applications. Our results show that ENMKL matches or outperforms $l1$-norm MKL in all tasks and only underperforms standard SVM in one scenario. Crucially, ENMKL produces sparser, more interpretable models by selectively weighting correlated kernels.

Motivation: 预训练模型在不重新训练的情况下泛化到未见数据集是基础模型的重要目标，但图结构数据中特征空间的维度和语义差异大，传统方法难以实现跨数据集的完全归纳推理。

Method: 引入视图空间作为统一表示轴，提出图视图变换，构建循环图视图变换模型，实现节点和特征排列等变的映射。

Conclusion: 视图空间为完全归纳节点表示学习提供了原则性和有效的基础，实现了跨数据集的泛化能力。

Abstract: Generalizing a pretrained model to unseen datasets without retraining is an essential step toward a foundation model. However, achieving such cross-dataset, fully inductive inference is difficult in graph-structured data where feature spaces vary widely in both dimensionality and semantics. Any transformation in the feature space can easily violate the inductive applicability to unseen datasets, strictly limiting the design space of a graph model. In this work, we introduce the view space, a novel representational axis in which arbitrary graphs can be naturally encoded in a unified manner. We then propose Graph View Transformation (GVT), a node- and feature-permutation-equivariant mapping in the view space. GVT serves as the building block for Recurrent GVT, a fully inductive model for node representation learning. Pretrained on OGBN-Arxiv and evaluated on 27 node-classification benchmarks, Recurrent GVT outperforms GraphAny, the prior fully inductive graph model, by +8.93% and surpasses 12 individually tuned GNNs by at least +3.30%. These results establish the view space as a principled and effective ground for fully inductive node representation learning.

Abstract: Fuzzy rule-based systems have been mostly used in interpretable decision-making because of their interpretable linguistic rules. However, interpretability requires both sensible linguistic partitions and small rule-base sizes, which are not guaranteed by many existing fuzzy rule-mining algorithms. Evolutionary approaches can produce high-quality models but suffer from prohibitive computational costs, while neural-based methods like ANFIS have problems retaining linguistic interpretations. In this work, we propose an adaptation of classical tree-based splitting algorithms from crisp rules to fuzzy trees, combining the computational efficiency of greedy algoritms with the interpretability advantages of fuzzy logic. This approach achieves interpretable linguistic partitions and substantially improves running time compared to evolutionary-based approaches while maintaining competitive predictive performance. Our experiments on tabular classification benchmarks proof that our method achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art fuzzy classifiers with significantly lower computational cost and produces more interpretable rule bases with constrained complexity.

Abstract: In streaming scenarios, models must learn continuously, adapting to concept drifts without erasing previously acquired knowledge. However, existing research communities address these challenges in isolation. Continual Learning (CL) focuses on long-term retention and mitigating catastrophic forgetting, often without strict real-time constraints. Stream Learning (SL) emphasizes rapid, efficient adaptation to high-frequency data streams, but typically neglects forgetting. Recent efforts have tried to combine these paradigms, yet no clear algorithmic overlap exists. We argue that large in-context tabular models (LTMs) provide a natural bridge for Streaming Continual Learning (SCL). In our view, unbounded streams should be summarized on-the-fly into compact sketches that can be consumed by LTMs. This recovers the classical SL motivation of compressing massive streams with fixed-size guarantees, while simultaneously aligning with the experience-replay desiderata of CL. To clarify this bridge, we show how the SL and CL communities implicitly adopt a divide-to-conquer strategy to manage the tension between plasticity (performing well on the current distribution) and stability (retaining past knowledge), while also imposing a minimal complexity constraint that motivates diversification (avoiding redundancy in what is stored) and retrieval (re-prioritizing past information when needed). Within this perspective, we propose structuring SCL with LTMs around two core principles of data selection for in-context learning: (1) distribution matching, which balances plasticity and stability, and (2) distribution compression, which controls memory size through diversification and retrieval mechanisms.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了SpectralKrum方法，将谱子空间估计与几何邻居选择结合，提升联邦学习中非IID数据和自适应攻击下的鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习架构存在基础性漏洞：拜占庭客户端可注入任意损坏的更新以破坏全局模型。现有鲁棒聚合方法在客户端数据分布异构且攻击者可观测防御机制时的效果显著下降

Method: SpectralKrum融合谱子空间估计与几何邻居选择：通过学习历史聚合估计低维流形，将传入更新投影到该子空间，在压缩坐标中应用Krum选择，并过滤残差能量超过数据驱动阈值的候选更新

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上评估显示，SpectralKrum对方向性和子空间感知攻击具有竞争力，但在标签翻转和极小极大攻击下优势有限（恶意更新在谱特征上与良性更新难以区分）

Conclusion: SpectralKrum在保持联邦学习隐私特性的同时增强了非IID场景下的鲁棒性，但在某些攻击模式下仍存在局限性

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) distributes model training across clients who retain their data locally, but this architecture exposes a fundamental vulnerability: Byzantine clients can inject arbitrarily corrupted updates that degrade or subvert the global model. While robust aggregation methods (including Krum, Bulyan, and coordinate-wise defenses) offer theoretical guarantees under idealized assumptions, their effectiveness erodes substantially when client data distributions are heterogeneous (non-IID) and adversaries can observe or approximate the defense mechanism.
  This paper introduces SpectralKrum, a defense that fuses spectral subspace estimation with geometric neighbor-based selection. The core insight is that benign optimization trajectories, despite per-client heterogeneity, concentrate near a low-dimensional manifold that can be estimated from historical aggregates. SpectralKrum projects incoming updates into this learned subspace, applies Krum selection in compressed coordinates, and filters candidates whose orthogonal residual energy exceeds a data-driven threshold. The method requires no auxiliary data, operates entirely on model updates, and preserves FL privacy properties.
  We evaluate SpectralKrum against eight robust baselines across seven attack scenarios on CIFAR-10 with Dirichlet-distributed non-IID partitions (alpha = 0.1). Experiments spanning over 56,000 training rounds show that SpectralKrum is competitive against directional and subspace-aware attacks (adaptive-steer, buffer-drift), but offers limited advantage under label-flip and min-max attacks where malicious updates remain spectrally indistinguishable from benign ones.

TL;DR: 摘要介绍了以测度为基架的软注意力分析方法，证明其在长提示下趋近于线性注意力，并可套用已有线性注意力的分析工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 变压器中softmax注意力的非线性结构使理论分析困难，需要发展分析框架来理解其在长提示下的行为及训练动态。

Method: 开发了基于测度的统一分析框架，研究了softmax注意力在有限和无限提示下的行为。对于独立同分布高斯输入，证明了在无限大提示时softmax收敛到线性化模型，并且有限提示下的输出与梯度具有非渐进浓度界限。针对上下文线性回归，使用可处理的无穷大提示动态来分析有限提示训练。

Result: 软注意力在长提示下展现出与线性注意力相近的解析结构，其输出与梯度的非渐进集中边界量化了有限提示模型的趋近速度。在整个训练过程中，这种集中保持稳定。对于上下文线性回归，该可分析性为有限提示训练提供了依据。

Conclusion: 当提示足够长时，大提示软注意力继承了其线性对应物的解析结构，从而为研究softmax注意力在长提示状态下的训练动态与统计行为提供了通用分析工具包。

Abstract: Softmax attention is a central component of transformer architectures, yet its nonlinear structure poses significant challenges for theoretical analysis. We develop a unified, measure-based framework for studying single-layer softmax attention under both finite and infinite prompts. For i.i.d. Gaussian inputs, we lean on the fact that the softmax operator converges in the infinite-prompt limit to a linear operator acting on the underlying input-token measure. Building on this insight, we establish non-asymptotic concentration bounds for the output and gradient of softmax attention, quantifying how rapidly the finite-prompt model approaches its infinite-prompt counterpart, and prove that this concentration remains stable along the entire training trajectory in general in-context learning settings with sub-Gaussian tokens. In the case of in-context linear regression, we use the tractable infinite-prompt dynamics to analyze training at finite prompt length. Our results allow optimization analyses developed for linear attention to transfer directly to softmax attention when prompts are sufficiently long, showing that large-prompt softmax attention inherits the analytical structure of its linear counterpart. This, in turn, provides a principled and broadly applicable toolkit for studying the training dynamics and statistical behavior of softmax attention layers in large prompt regimes.

*Ahmad Shamail,Claire McWhite*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于几何的L-形分析方法，通过随机顺序添加要素并观察其贡献变化，来量化要素间的相互作用模式，包括协同作用、冗余和独立性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多系统组件间存在复杂互动关系（协同、冗余、独立），但缺乏统一的度量方法来可视化和量化这些相互作用。研究者希望开发一种简单几何方法，通过顺序添加要素的贡献变化模式来揭示互动结构。

Method: 采用随机序列添加要素的方法，在多次试验中绘制要素贡献图。通过观察出现的L-形模式来识别相互作用：冗余对形成仅第一添加要素贡献的L形，协同对形成仅共同添加时才贡献的L形，独立要素则显示顺序不变分布。引入L-分数从-1（完美协同）到+1（完美冗余）的连续度量。

Result: 该方法成功量化了要素间的相互作用结构，能通过二维点云可视化和数值L-分数准确区分协同、冗余和独立关系。虽然仅基于成对测量，但能自然揭示三个或更多要素间的高阶互动关系。

Conclusion: 提出了一种与指标无关的通用几何方法，适用于任何能通过非重复要素序列进行增量性能评估的领域，为揭示相互作用结构提供了统一框架。

Abstract: Many systems exhibit complex interactions between their components: some features or actions amplify each other's effects, others provide redundant information, and some contribute independently. We present a simple geometric method for discovering interactions and redundancies: when elements are added in random sequential orders and their contributions plotted over many trials, characteristic L-shaped patterns emerge that directly reflect interaction structure. The approach quantifies how the contribution of each element depends on those added before it, revealing patterns that distinguish interaction, independence, and redundancy on a unified scale. When pairwise contributions are visualized as two--dimensional point clouds, redundant pairs form L--shaped patterns where only the first-added element contributes, while synergistic pairs form L--shaped patterns where only elements contribute together. Independent elements show order--invariant distributions. We formalize this with the L--score, a continuous measure ranging from $-1$ (perfect synergy, e.g. $Y=X_1X_2$) to $0$ (independence) to $+1$ (perfect redundancy, $X_1 \approx X_2$). The relative scaling of the L--shaped arms reveals feature dominance in which element consistently provides more information. Although computed only from pairwise measurements, higher--order interactions among three or more elements emerge naturally through consistent cross--pair relationships (e.g. AB, AC, BC). The method is metric--agnostic and broadly applicable to any domain where performance can be evaluated incrementally over non-repeating element sequences, providing a unified geometric approach to uncovering interaction structure.

Abstract: Combinatorial sequential decision making problems are typically modeled as mixed integer linear programs (MILPs) and solved via branch and bound (B&B) algorithms. The inherent difficulty of modeling MILPs that accurately represent stochastic real world problems leads to suboptimal performance in the real world. Recently, machine learning methods have been applied to build MILP models for decision quality rather than how accurately they model the real world problem. However, these approaches typically rely on supervised learning, assume access to true optimal decisions, and use surrogates for the MILP gradients. In this work, we introduce a proof of concept CORL framework that end to end fine tunes an MILP scheme using reinforcement learning (RL) on real world data to maximize its operational performance. We enable this by casting an MILP solved by B&B as a differentiable stochastic policy compatible with RL. We validate the CORL method in a simple illustrative combinatorial sequential decision making example.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Scaling test-time computation improves large language model performance without additional training. Recent work demonstrates that techniques such as repeated sampling, self-verification, and self-reflection can significantly enhance task success by allocating more inference-time compute. However, applying these techniques across multiple agents in a multi-agent system is difficult: there does not exist principled mechanisms to allocate compute to foster collaboration among agents, to extend test-time scaling to collaborative interactions, or to distribute compute across agents under explicit budget constraints. To address this gap, we propose FutureWeaver, a framework for planning and optimizing test-time compute allocation in multi-agent systems under fixed budgets. FutureWeaver introduces modularized collaboration, formalized as callable functions that encapsulate reusable multi-agent workflows. These modules are automatically derived through self-play reflection by abstracting recurring interaction patterns from past trajectories. Building on these modules, FutureWeaver employs a dual-level planning architecture that optimizes compute allocation by reasoning over the current task state while also speculating on future steps. Experiments on complex agent benchmarks demonstrate that FutureWeaver consistently outperforms baselines across diverse budget settings, validating its effectiveness for multi-agent collaboration in inference-time optimization.

TL;DR: TriFlow是一个渐进式多智能体框架，通过检索、规划和治理三阶段流程，将结构化推理与语言灵活性结合，解决了现实旅行规划中的约束满足、工具协调和效率问题，在多个基准测试中实现最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界旅行规划需要将开放式用户请求转换为可执行的行程，同时满足严格的空间、时间、预算约束并与用户偏好对齐。现有基于LLM的智能体在约束满足、工具协调和效率方面存在不足，经常产生不可行或成本高昂的计划。

Method: TriFlow采用渐进式多智能体框架，通过检索、规划、治理三阶段流程：逐步缩小搜索空间，通过规则-LLM协作组装约束一致的行程，进行有界迭代优化以确保全局可行性和个性化。

Result: 在TravelPlanner和TripTailor基准测试中达到最先进结果，分别实现91.1%和97%的最终通过率，相比当前SOTA运行时效率提升超过10倍。

Conclusion: TriFlow通过渐进式多智能体框架有效解决了旅行规划中的约束满足问题，实现了高通过率和显著的效率提升，为现实世界旅行规划提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world trip planning requires transforming open-ended user requests into executable itineraries under strict spatial, temporal, and budgetary constraints while aligning with user preferences. Existing LLM-based agents struggle with constraint satisfaction, tool coordination, and efficiency, often producing infeasible or costly plans. To address these limitations, we present TriFlow, a progressive multi-agent framework that unifies structured reasoning and language-based flexibility through a three-stage pipeline of retrieval, planning, and governance. By this design, TriFlow progressively narrows the search space, assembles constraint-consistent itineraries via rule-LLM collaboration, and performs bounded iterative refinement to ensure global feasibility and personalisation. Evaluations on TravelPlanner and TripTailor benchmarks demonstrated state-of-the-art results, achieving 91.1% and 97% final pass rates, respectively, with over 10x runtime efficiency improvement compared to current SOTA.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉验证码基准测试存在局限性：以往研究根据具体目标定制基准，无法全面覆盖所有CAPTCHA类型；缺少专门针对LVLMs的基准测试；需要多维度、全面的评估体系。

Method: 创建CAPTURE基准测试，包含4种主要CAPTCHA类型和25个子类型，来自31个供应商；具有丰富的类别多样性、大规模数据和专门为LVLM设计的标签，解决了以往研究在数据全面性和标签针对性方面的不足。

Result: 通过该基准测试评估，发现当前LVLMs在解决CAPTCHAs方面表现不佳，显示出模型在实际验证码识别任务上的局限性。

Conclusion: CAPTURE基准填补了LVLM领域在CAPTCHA评估方面的空白，提供了全面、多维度的评估标准，揭示了现有模型的不足，为未来研究提供了重要基准。

Abstract: Benefiting from strong and efficient multi-modal alignment strategies, Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) are able to simulate human visual and reasoning capabilities, such as solving CAPTCHAs. However, existing benchmarks based on visual CAPTCHAs still face limitations. Previous studies, when designing benchmarks and datasets, customized them according to their research objectives. Consequently, these benchmarks cannot comprehensively cover all CAPTCHA types. Notably, there is a dearth of dedicated benchmarks for LVLMs. To address this problem, we introduce a novel CAPTCHA benchmark for the first time, named CAPTURE CAPTCHA for Testing Under Real-world Experiments, specifically for LVLMs. Our benchmark encompasses 4 main CAPTCHA types and 25 sub-types from 31 vendors. The diversity enables a multi-dimensional and thorough evaluation of LVLM performance. CAPTURE features extensive class variety, large-scale data, and unique LVLM-tailored labels, filling the gaps in previous research in terms of data comprehensiveness and labeling pertinence. When evaluated by this benchmark, current LVLMs demonstrate poor performance in solving CAPTCHAs.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理和生成方面表现出强大能力，但在多轮任务中的行为往往缺乏可靠性和可验证性，需要一种能够提供明确行为指导的框架。

Method: 框架包含三个组件：1）轻量级任务分析器选择推理和生成策略；2）推理模块学习可验证的观察-行动映射；3）生成模块通过验证或确定性合成确保约束合规的输出。

Result: 研究表明，当智能体与环境交互时，这些组件共同进化，产生了可信赖的行为。

Conclusion: 该框架使LLM智能体能够在具有明确观察、行动和奖励信号的强化学习形式化环境中，按照明确的行为指导行动，实现了行为的可靠性和可验证性。

Abstract: Large Language Models demonstrate strong reasoning and generation abilities, yet their behavior in multi-turn tasks often lacks reliability and verifiability. We present a task completion framework that enables LLM-based agents to act under explicit behavioral guidance in environments described by reinforcement learning formalisms with defined observation, action, and reward signals.
  The framework integrates three components: a lightweight task profiler that selects reasoning and generation strategies, a reasoning module that learns verifiable observation - action mappings, and a generation module that enforces constraint-compliant outputs through validation or deterministic synthesis. We show that as the agent interacts with the environment, these components co-evolve, yielding trustworthy behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前 LLM 多智能体系统缺乏在明确的预算（如 token 成本、延迟）约束下的优化，这往往导致次优的性能表现。

Method: 提出了 AgentBalance 框架，采用“首先选择模型，然后设计拓扑”的策略，使用异质模型构建、角色匹配，并结合自适应通信拓扑生成。

Result: 实验表明，在相同的预算下，AgentBalance 最高提升了 10%（token 成本）和 22%（延迟）的性能，并获得更好的性能-预算曲线。

Conclusion: AgentBalance 可以作为一种插件，有效提升现有多智能体系统在预算约束下的表现，且对于未参与训练的 LLM 也具有较好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) are becoming indispensable building blocks for web-scale applications such as web search, social network analytics, and online customer support, where cost-effectiveness is increasingly the primary constraint for large-scale deployment. While recent work improves MAS cost-effectiveness by shaping inter-agent communication topologies and selecting agent backbones, it rarely models and optimizes under explicit token-cost and latency budgets that reflect deployment constraints. This often leads to topology-first designs and suboptimal cost-effectiveness when budgets are binding. We present AgentBalance, a framework for constructing cost-effective MAS under explicit token-cost and latency budgets via a backbone-then-topology design. AgentBalance first performs backbone-oriented agent generation, constructing agents with heterogeneous backbones through LLM pool construction, pool selection, and role-backbone matching. It then performs adaptive MAS topology generation, guiding inter-agent communication via agent representation learning, gating, and latency-aware topology synthesis. Experiments on benchmarks with 14 candidate LLM backbones show that AgentBalance achieves up to 10% and 22% performance gains under matched token-cost and latency budgets, respectively, and yields strong AUC on performance-versus-budget curves across benchmarks. AgentBalance also functions as a plug-in for existing MAS, improving performance under the same token-cost and latency constraints, and it generalizes well to unseen LLMs for practical, budget-aware deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前解释性人工智能中最常用的归因方法评估指标存在显著缺陷——不同的基线选择会偏好不同的归因方法，甚至简单的线性模型在不同基线下的最优方法都会相互矛盾，这表明现有的评估方法存在问题。需要研究如何选择合适的基线来更公平地评估归因方法。

Method: 分析基线应具备的两个理想特性：移除信息和避免产生过度分布外图像。评估现有基线的表现，发现它们无法同时满足这两个要求，呈现权衡关系。提出新基线，利用特征可视化技术生成模型依赖的基线，能够移除信息而不产生过度分布外图像。

Result: 1. 验证了现有基线选择会系统性地偏袒某些归因方法
2. 发现现有基线存在权衡：要么能有效移除信息，要么产生较少分布外图像，但不能两者兼顾
3. 提出的新基线在权衡方面表现优于现有基线

Conclusion: 归因方法的评估存在严重的基线选择偏见问题，需要引入模型依赖的基线来提供更公平、一致的评估。建议解释性人工智能社区重新审视当前的评估实践，考虑将提出的新基线作为评估标准的一部分。

Abstract: Attribution methods are among the most prevalent techniques in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and are usually evaluated and compared using Fidelity metrics, with Insertion and Deletion being the most popular. These metrics rely on a baseline function to alter the pixels of the input image that the attribution map deems most important. In this work, we highlight a critical problem with these metrics: the choice of a given baseline will inevitably favour certain attribution methods over others. More concerningly, even a simple linear model with commonly used baselines contradicts itself by designating different optimal methods. A question then arises: which baseline should we use? We propose to study this problem through two desirable properties of a baseline: (i) that it removes information and (ii) that it does not produce overly out-of-distribution (OOD) images. We first show that none of the tested baselines satisfy both criteria, and there appears to be a trade-off among current baselines: either they remove information or they produce a sequence of OOD images. Finally, we introduce a novel baseline by leveraging recent work in feature visualisation to artificially produce a model-dependent baseline that removes information without being overly OOD, thus improving on the trade-off when compared to other existing baselines.

Abstract: We introduce Motif-2-12.7B-Reasoning, a 12.7B parameter language model designed to bridge the gap between open-weight systems and proprietary frontier models in complex reasoning and long-context understanding. Addressing the common challenges of model collapse and training instability in reasoning adaptation, we propose a comprehensive, reproducible training recipe spanning system, data, and algorithmic optimizations. Our approach combines memory-efficient infrastructure for 64K-token contexts using hybrid parallelism and kernel-level optimizations with a two-stage Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) curriculum that mitigates distribution mismatch through verified, aligned synthetic data. Furthermore, we detail a robust Reinforcement Learning Fine-Tuning (RLFT) pipeline that stabilizes training via difficulty-aware data filtering and mixed-policy trajectory reuse. Empirical results demonstrate that Motif-2-12.7B-Reasoning achieves performance comparable to models with significantly larger parameter counts across mathematics, coding, and agentic benchmarks, offering the community a competitive open model and a practical blueprint for scaling reasoning capabilities under realistic compute constraints.

Abstract: The No-Three-In-Line problem asks for the maximum number of points that can be placed on an n by n grid with no three collinear, representing a famous problem in combinatorial geometry. While classical methods like Integer Linear Programming (ILP) guarantee optimal solutions, they face exponential scaling with grid size, and recent advances in machine learning offer promising alternatives for pattern-based approximation. This paper presents the first systematic comparison of classical optimization and AI approaches to this problem, evaluating their performance against traditional algorithms. We apply PatternBoost transformer learning and reinforcement learning (PPO) to this problem for the first time, comparing them against ILP. ILP achieves provably optimal solutions up to 19 by 19 grids, while PatternBoost matches optimal performance up to 14 by 14 grids with 96% test loss reduction. PPO achieves perfect solutions on 10 by 10 grids but fails at 11 by 11 grids, where constraint violations prevent valid configurations. These results demonstrate that classical optimization remains essential for exact solutions while AI methods offer competitive performance on smaller instances, with hybrid approaches presenting the most promising direction for scaling to larger problem sizes.

Abstract: AI-generated text detectors have recently gained adoption in educational and professional contexts. Prior research has uncovered isolated cases of bias, particularly against English Language Learners (ELLs) however, there is a lack of systematic evaluation of such systems across broader sociolinguistic factors. In this work, we propose BAID, a comprehensive evaluation framework for AI detectors across various types of biases. As a part of the framework, we introduce over 200k samples spanning 7 major categories: demographics, age, educational grade level, dialect, formality, political leaning, and topic. We also generated synthetic versions of each sample with carefully crafted prompts to preserve the original content while reflecting subgroup-specific writing styles. Using this, we evaluate four open-source state-of-the-art AI text detectors and find consistent disparities in detection performance, particularly low recall rates for texts from underrepresented groups. Our contributions provide a scalable, transparent approach for auditing AI detectors and emphasize the need for bias-aware evaluation before these tools are deployed for public use.

Abstract: As AI and web agents become pervasive in decision-making, it is critical to design intelligent systems that not only support sustainability efforts but also guard against misinformation. Greenwashing, i.e., misleading corporate sustainability claims, poses a major challenge to environmental progress. To address this challenge, we introduce EmeraldMind, a fact-centric framework integrating a domain-specific knowledge graph with retrieval-augmented generation to automate greenwashing detection. EmeraldMind builds the EmeraldGraph from diverse corporate ESG (environmental, social, and governance) reports, surfacing verifiable evidence, often missing in generic knowledge bases, and supporting large language models in claim assessment. The framework delivers justification-centric classifications, presenting transparent, evidence-backed verdicts and abstaining responsibly when claims cannot be verified. Experiments on a new greenwashing claims dataset demonstrate that EmeraldMind achieves competitive accuracy, greater coverage, and superior explanation quality compared to generic LLMs, without the need for fine-tuning or retraining.

*Yuan Shen,Xiaojun Wu,Linghua Yu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究通过模拟真实临床场景，发现主流大语言模型在处理含噪声的医疗主诉时均出现功能缺陷，极端噪声下甚至功能崩溃，提示存在类似MASLD的代谢功能障碍问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大语言模型从嘈杂冗余的患者主诉中提取核心医疗信息的能力，并验证其是否存在类似代谢功能障碍的特征性表现。

Method: 采用基于标准化医疗探针的横断面分析设计，选取GPT-4o、Gemini 2.5、DeepSeek 3.1、Qwen3-Max四种主流LLMs，使用包含20个医疗探针的评估系统模拟真实临床沟通环境，由两名独立临床医生进行双盲反向评分。

Result: 所有测试模型均表现出不同程度功能缺陷，Qwen3-Max整体表现最佳，Gemini 2.5最差；极端噪声下多数模型功能崩溃；GPT-4o在DVT继发PE风险评估中出现严重误判。

Conclusion: 首次实证确认LLMs在处理临床信息时表现出类似代谢功能障碍的特征，提出“AI-MASLD”概念，为AI医疗应用提供重要安全警示，强调当前LLMs必须在人类专家监督下作为辅助工具使用。

Abstract: This study aims to simulate real-world clinical scenarios to systematically evaluate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract core medical information from patient chief complaints laden with noise and redundancy, and to verify whether they exhibit a functional decline analogous to Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD). We employed a cross-sectional analysis design based on standardized medical probes, selecting four mainstream LLMs as research subjects: GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5, DeepSeek 3.1, and Qwen3-Max. An evaluation system comprising twenty medical probes across five core dimensions was used to simulate a genuine clinical communication environment. All probes had gold-standard answers defined by clinical experts and were assessed via a double-blind, inverse rating scale by two independent clinicians. The results show that all tested models exhibited functional defects to varying degrees, with Qwen3-Max demonstrating the best overall performance and Gemini 2.5 the worst. Under conditions of extreme noise, most models experienced a functional collapse. Notably, GPT-4o made a severe misjudgment in the risk assessment for pulmonary embolism (PE) secondary to deep vein thrombosis (DVT). This research is the first to empirically confirm that LLMs exhibit features resembling metabolic dysfunction when processing clinical information, proposing the innovative concept of "AI-Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (AI-MASLD)". These findings offer a crucial safety warning for the application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare, emphasizing that current LLMs must be used as auxiliary tools under human expert supervision, as there remains a significant gap between their theoretical knowledge and practical clinical application.

TL;DR: AI基准测试面临复杂性和动态性挑战，需要从静态基准转向连续自适应框架，并开展AI基准工艺教育。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI基准测试过于静态，无法反映快速发展的模型架构、数据集和部署环境，导致基准结果与现实性能脱节，需要建立动态评估体系。

Method: 提出AI基准工艺概念，结合技术革新和系统性教育，通过MLCommons、DOE万亿参数联盟等项目经验，构建透明、可复现的动态基准框架。

Result: 识别出资源需求高、专用硬件访问有限、基准设计专业知识缺乏、结果与应用领域关联不明确等关键障碍。

Conclusion: 动态包容的基准测试对AI发展至关重要，需要社区共同努力建立AI基准工艺基础，支持负责任、可复现的AI部署。

Abstract: Benchmarks are a cornerstone of modern machine learning, enabling reproducibility, comparison, and scientific progress. However, AI benchmarks are increasingly complex, requiring dynamic, AI-focused workflows. Rapid evolution in model architectures, scale, datasets, and deployment contexts makes evaluation a moving target. Large language models often memorize static benchmarks, causing a gap between benchmark results and real-world performance.
  Beyond traditional static benchmarks, continuous adaptive benchmarking frameworks are needed to align scientific assessment with deployment risks. This calls for skills and education in AI Benchmark Carpentry. From our experience with MLCommons, educational initiatives, and programs like the DOE's Trillion Parameter Consortium, key barriers include high resource demands, limited access to specialized hardware, lack of benchmark design expertise, and uncertainty in relating results to application domains. Current benchmarks often emphasize peak performance on top-tier hardware, offering limited guidance for diverse, real-world scenarios.
  Benchmarking must become dynamic, incorporating evolving models, updated data, and heterogeneous platforms while maintaining transparency, reproducibility, and interpretability. Democratization requires both technical innovation and systematic education across levels, building sustained expertise in benchmark design and use. Benchmarks should support application-relevant comparisons, enabling informed, context-sensitive decisions. Dynamic, inclusive benchmarking will ensure evaluation keeps pace with AI evolution and supports responsible, reproducible, and accessible AI deployment. Community efforts can provide a foundation for AI Benchmark Carpentry.

Abstract: Energy demand prediction is critical for grid operators, industrial energy
  consumers, and service providers. Energy demand is influenced by multiple
  factors, including weather conditions (e.g. temperature, humidity, wind
  speed, solar radiation), and calendar information (e.g. hour of day and
  month of year), which further affect daily work and life schedules. These
  factors are causally interdependent, making the problem more complex than
  simple correlation-based learning techniques satisfactorily allow for. We
  propose a structural causal model that explains the causal relationship
  between these variables. A full analysis is performed to validate our causal
  beliefs, also revealing important insights consistent with prior studies.
  For example, our causal model reveals that energy demand responds to
  temperature fluctuations with season-dependent sensitivity. Additionally, we
  find that energy demand exhibits lower variance in winter due to the
  decoupling effect between temperature changes and daily activity patterns.
  We then build a Bayesian model, which takes advantage of the causal insights
  we learned as prior knowledge. The model is trained and tested on unseen
  data and yields state-of-the-art performance in the form of a 3.84 percent MAPE on
  the test set. The model also demonstrates strong robustness, as the
  cross-validation across two years of data yields an average MAPE of 3.88 percent.

TL;DR: TxAgent是一个面向医疗决策的智能体AI系统，通过优化的检索增强生成技术和统一的生物医学工具套件，提升治疗推荐的准确性和安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床医疗决策具有高风险特性，需要AI系统在处理复杂的患者特征、疾病过程和药物相互作用时提供可靠的多步推理。现有通用RAG系统在医疗应用中存在安全限制，需要确保推理轨迹和工具调用的准确性。

Method: TxAgent采用基于Llama-3.1-8B的微调模型，通过动态生成和执行函数调用来访问统一的生物医学工具套件(ToolUniverse)，整合了FDA Drug API、OpenTargets和Monarch等资源。采用改进的工具检索策略和token级推理评估协议。

Conclusion: 医疗AI系统需要专门设计的检索增强生成方法，关注推理轨迹和工具调用的准确性。TxAgent的方法展示了对工具检索策略的优化能显著提升治疗推理系统的性能，为临床决策支持系统提供了有价值的参考。

Abstract: Therapeutic decision-making in clinical medicine constitutes a high-stakes domain in which AI guidance interacts with complex interactions among patient characteristics, disease processes, and pharmacological agents. Tasks such as drug recommendation, treatment planning, and adverse-effect prediction demand robust, multi-step reasoning grounded in reliable biomedical knowledge. Agentic AI methods, exemplified by TxAgent, address these challenges through iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). TxAgent employs a fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B model that dynamically generates and executes function calls to a unified biomedical tool suite (ToolUniverse), integrating FDA Drug API, OpenTargets, and Monarch resources to ensure access to current therapeutic information. In contrast to general-purpose RAG systems, medical applications impose stringent safety constraints, rendering the accuracy of both the reasoning trace and the sequence of tool invocations critical. These considerations motivate evaluation protocols treating token-level reasoning and tool-usage behaviors as explicit supervision signals. This work presents insights derived from our participation in the CURE-Bench NeurIPS 2025 Challenge, which benchmarks therapeutic-reasoning systems using metrics that assess correctness, tool utilization, and reasoning quality. We analyze how retrieval quality for function (tool) calls influences overall model performance and demonstrate performance gains achieved through improved tool-retrieval strategies. Our work was awarded the Excellence Award in Open Science. Complete information can be found at https://curebench.ai/.

### [134] [Sphere Decoding Revisited](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11195)
*Zheng Wang,Cong Ling,Shi Jin,Yongming Huang,Feifei Gao*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 本文对球型解码（SD）范式进行了改进，通过引入额外自由度来开发解码潜力。具体提出了等效球型解码（ESD）方法，并通过参数K和σ明确界定了复杂度。同时通过规范化加权和候选保护机制进一步优化，实现了可调控的解码性能权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统球型解码的复杂度难以精确描述和控制。为了在整数最小二乘问题中实现明确且可调控的解码权衡，需要新的解码框架来精确量化复杂度并有效利用解码潜力。

Method: 提出了等效球型解码（ESD）方法，引入初始搜索大小K和偏差因子σ两个新参数来控制球半径D。通过设置D=σ√(2lnK)实现了复杂度上界|S|<nK的明确控制。进一步设计了规范化加权和候选保护机制来增强ESD算法。

Result: 理论证明ESD复杂度可以被精确限定，实现了首个明确可表征的球型解码复杂度。增强机制在相同K和σ参数下实现了更大的球半径，提供了更好的解码权衡。ESD算法可以灵活调节K来连接次优和最优解码性能。

Conclusion: ESD为球型解码提供了一种可调控且灵活的复杂度-性能权衡框架，能够在大规模MIMO检测等应用中有效平衡解码性能和计算复杂度。

Abstract: In this paper, the paradigm of sphere decoding (SD) for solving the integer least square problem (ILS) is revisited, where extra degrees of freedom are introduced to exploit the decoding potential. Firstly, the equivalent sphere decoding (ESD) is proposed, which is essentially the same with the classic Fincke-Pohst sphere decoding but characterizes the sphere radius $D>0$ with two new parameters named as initial searching size $K>1$ and deviation factor $σ>0$. By fixing $σ$ properly, we show that given the sphere radius $D\triangleqσ\sqrt{2\ln K}$, the complexity of ESD in terms of the number of visited nodes is upper bounded by $|S|<nK$, thus resulting in an explicit and tractable decoding trade-off solely controlled by $K$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the complexity of sphere decoding is exactly specified, where considerable decoding potential can be explored from it. After that, two enhancement mechanisms named as normalized weighting and candidate protection are proposed to further upgrade the ESD algorithm. On one hand, given the same setups of $K$ and $σ$, a larger sphere radius is achieved, indicating a better decoding trade-off. On the other hand, the proposed ESD algorithm is generalized, which bridges suboptimal and optimal decoding performance through the flexible choice of $K$. Finally, further performance optimization and complexity reduction with respect to ESD are also derived, and the introduced tractable and flexible decoding trade-off is verified through large-scale MIMO detection.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We propose a unified mathematical framework for rate-distortion theory, lattice quantization, and modern error-correcting codes by emphasizing their variational and convex-analytic structure. First, we establish a Gibbs-type variational formulation of the rate-distortion function and show that optimal test channels form an exponential family, with Fullback-Leibler divergence acting as a Bregman divergence. This yields a generalized Pythagorean theorem for projections and a Legendre duality that couples distortion constraints with inverse temperature parameters. Second, the reverse water-filling metaphor is extended to distributed lattice quantization, deriving distortion allocation bounds across eigenmodes of conditional covariance matrices. Third, inference is formalized as decoding by showing that belief propagation in LDPC ensembles and polarization in polar codes can be interpreted as recursive variational inference procedures. These results unify compression, quantization, and decoding as convex projections of continuous information onto discrete manifolds. Extensions to neural compression and quantum information are sketched as corollaries, illustrating the universality of the framework. Illustrative connections to other scientific fields are also presented. Finally, complementary numerical examples and scripts are located in the appendix

Abstract: We derive a few extended versions of the Kraft inequality for lossy compression, which pave the way to the derivation of several refinements and extensions of the well known Shannon lower bound in a variety of instances of rate-distortion coding. These refinements and extensions include sharper bounds for one-to-one codes and $D$-semifaithful codes, a Shannon lower bound for distortion measures based on sliding-window functions, and an individual-sequence counterpart of the Shannon lower bound.

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 针对素数幂字母表的对称离散无记忆信道，本文证明了存在容量趋近的纠错码能够通过复杂度为线性大小的算术电路实现编码，且其深度为逆阿克曼函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究在构造逼近信道容量的纠错码时，通常编码复杂度较高（如深度可能为对数或线性阶）。本文旨在探索是否存在深度远低于线性的容量趋近编码电路，尤其是在编码尺寸线性增长的同时，深度仅受控于极慢增长的逆阿克曼函数。

Method: 通过组合Gál等人以及Drucker和Li提出的恒定速率和距离的线性码构造，再叠加一个由均匀随机赋权的分散图所构成的附加层，形成整体编码结构。该构造利用了素数幂字母表的有限域运算，编码电路采用带权加法门的算术电路实现。

Result: 成功构造出编码复杂度为线性尺寸且深度为逆阿克曼函数的纠错码，并证明其速率能够逼近任意给定信道容量。这意味着容量趋近的纠错码可以同时具备极低的深度和线性尺寸的高效编码电路。

Conclusion: 研究表明，对于广泛类型的信道（如对称离散无记忆信道），存在一类容量趋近的纠错码，其编码电路复杂度远低于以往认知，这不仅在理论上拓展了高效编码的可能性，也为实际应用中低延迟编码方案的设计提供了指导。

Abstract: For any symmetric discrete memoryless channel with input and output alphabet of size $q$, where $q$ is a prime power, we prove that there exist error-correcting codes approaching channel capacity encodable by arithmetic circuits (with weighted addition gates) over $\mathbb{F}_q$ of size $O(n)$ and depth $α(n)$, where $α(n)$ is a version of the inverse Ackermann function. Our results suggest that certain capacity-achieving codes admit highly efficient encoding circuits that are both in linear size and of inverse-Ackermann depth. Our construction composes a linear code with constant rate and relative distance, based on the constructions of Gál, Hansen, Koucký, Pudlák, and Viola [IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory 59(10), 2013] and Drucker and Li [COCOON 2023], with an additional layer formed by a disperser graph whose edge weights are chosen uniformly at random.

TL;DR: 该研究利用核范数最小化从复投影3-design的秩一测量中恢复低秩Hermitian矩阵，建立了与之前已知的4-design最佳结果相当的理论保证，填补了3-design恢复理论的空缺。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复投影t-design可以部分去随机化高斯测量模型，但之前仅知4-design具有近最优恢复保证，而2-design无法用亚二次测量恢复。3-design的情况一直未解，需要填补这一理论空白。

Method: 采用核范数最小化方法，基于从复投影3-design获得的秩一测量数据，对低秩Hermitian矩阵进行恢复。重点关注3-design框架下稳定鲁棒的恢复条件。

Result: 建立了与4-design最佳结果相当的恢复保证，推导了稳定和鲁棒低秩恢复所需的测量数量界限，填补了3-design在矩阵恢复理论中的空缺。

Conclusion: 研究证明3-design可实现与4-design相当的恢复性能，且3-design比4-design更易显式构造，增强了理论结果的实际应用价值。

Abstract: We study the recovery of low-rank Hermitian matrices from rank-one measurements obtained by uniform sampling from complex projective 3-designs, using nuclear-norm minimization. This framework includes phase retrieval as a special case via the PhaseLift method. In general, complex projective $t$-designs provide a practical means of partially derandomizing Gaussian measurement models. While near-optimal recovery guarantees are known for $4$-designs, and it is known that $2$-designs do not permit recovery with a subquadratic number of measurements, the case of $3$-designs has remained open. In this work, we close this gap by establishing recovery guarantees for (exact and approximate) $3$-designs that parallel the best-known results for $4$-designs. In particular, we derive bounds on the number of measurements sufficient for stable and robust low-rank recovery via nuclear-norm minimization. Our results are especially relevant in practice, as explicit constructions of $4$-designs are significantly more challenging than those of $3$-designs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Payload swing during rapid slewing of mobile cranes poses a safety risk, as it generates overturning moments that can lead to tip-over accidents of mobile cranes. Currently, to limit the risk of tip-over, mobile crane operators are forced to either reduce the slewing speed (which lowers productivity) or reduce the load being carried to reduce the induced moments. Both of these approaches reduce productivity. This paper seeks to enable rapid slewing without compromising safety by applying input shaping to the crane-slewing commands generated by the operator. A key advantage of this approach is that the input shaper requires only the information about the rope length, and does not require detailed mobile crane dynamics. Simulations and experiments show that the proposed method reduces residual payload swing and enables significantly higher slewing speeds without tip over, reducing slewing completion time by at least 38% compared to unshaped control. Human control with input shaping improves task completion time by 13%, reduces the peak swing by 18%, and reduces the potential of collisions by 82% when compared to unshaped control. Moreover, shaped control with a human had no tip-over, whereas large swing led to tip-over without input shaping. Thereby, the proposed method substantially recovers the operational-safety envelope of mobile cranes (designed to avoid tip-over using static analysis) that would otherwise be lost in dynamic conditions. Videos and demonstrations are available at https://youtu.be/dVy3bbIhrBU.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We investigate multicellular sender receiver systems embedded in hydrogel beads, where diffusible signals mediate interactions among heterogeneous cells. Such systems are modeled by PDE ODE couplings that combine three dimensional diffusion with nonlinear intracellular dynamics, making analysis and simulation challenging. We show that the diffusion dynamics converges exponentially to a quasi steady spatial profile and use singular perturbation theory to reduce the model to a finite dimensional multiagent network. A closed form communication matrix derived from the spherical Green's function captures the effective sender receiver coupling. Numerical results show the reduced model closely matches the full dynamics while enabling scalable simulation of large cell populations.

The formulated problem belongs to the class of chance-constrained model predictive control (CC-MPC) problems. To efficiently solve the CC-MPC problem, we develop an approximate solution algorithm with guaranteed confidence levels. Finally, we develop gig-worker models based on data collected through crowdsourcing.

Abstract: With the extensive integration of volatile and uncertain renewable energy, power systems face significant challenges in primary frequency regulation due to instantaneous power fluctuations. However, the maximum frequency deviation constraint is inherently non-convex, and commonly used two-stage dispatch methods overlook causality, potentially resulting in infeasible day-ahead decisions. This paper presents a controlled evolution-based day-ahead robust dispatch method to address these issues. First, we suggest the convex relaxation technique to transform the maximum frequency deviation constraint to facilitate optimization. Then, an evolution-based robust dispatch framework is introduced to align day-ahead decisions with intraday strategies, ensuring both frequency security and power supply reliability. Additionally, a novel controlled evolution-based algorithm is developed to solve this framework efficiently. Case studies on a modified IEEE 14-bus system demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in enhancing frequency security and system reliability.

Abstract: We propose an input-output data-driven framework for certifying the stability of interconnected multiple-input-multiple-output linear time-invariant discrete-time systems via QSR-dissipativity. That is, by using measured input-output trajectories of each subsystem, we verify dissipative properties and extract local passivity indices without requiring an explicit model identification.These passivity indices are then used to derive conditions under which the equilibrium of the interconnected system is stable. In particular, the framework identifies how the lack of passivity in some subsystems can be compensated by surpluses in others. The proposed approach enables a compositional stability analysis by combining subsystem-level conditions into a criterion valid for the overall interconnected system. We illustrate via a numerical case study, how to compute channel-wise passivity indices and infer stability guarantees directly from data with the proposed method.

Abstract: Robustly compensating network constraints such as delays and packet dropouts in networked control systems is crucial for remotely controlling dynamical systems. This work proposes a novel prediction consistent method to cope with delays and packet losses as encountered in UDP-type communication systems. The augmented control system preserves all properties of the original model predictive control method under the network constraints. Furthermore, we propose to use linear tube MPC with the novel method and show that the system converges robustly to the origin under mild conditions. We illustrate this with simulation examples of a cart pole and a continuous stirred tank reactor.

Abstract: Networked Predictive Control is widely used to mitigate the effect of delays and dropouts in Networked Control Systems, particularly when these exceed the sampling time. A key design choice of these methods is the delay bound, which determines the prediction horizon and the robustness to information loss. This work develops a systematic method to select the optimal bound by quantifying the trade-off between prediction errors and open-loop operation caused by communication losses. Simulation studies demonstrate the performance gains achieved with the optimal bound.

Abstract: Situational awareness for connected and automated vehicles describes the ability to perceive and predict the behavior of other road-users in the near surroundings. However, pedestrians can become occluded by vehicles or infrastructure, creating significant safety risks due to limited visibility. Vehicle-to-everything communication enables the sharing of perception data between connected road-users, allowing for a more comprehensive awareness. The main challenge is how to fuse perception data when measurements are inconsistent with the true locations of pedestrians. Inconsistent measurements can occur due to sensor noise, false positives, or communication issues. This paper employs set-based estimation with constrained zonotopes to compute a confidence metric for the measurement set from each sensor. These sets and their confidences are then fused using hybrid zonotopes. This method can account for inconsistent measurements, enabling reliable and robust fusion of the sensor data. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in both simulation and real experiments.

Abstract: This article presents a data-driven, control-oriented modelling methodology for urban drainage systems (UDS). The proposed framework requires three main key components: input-output data from the element to be modelled, expert knowledge to define the model structure, and data-fitting techniques to obtain optimal parameters. The methodology is evaluated using a realistic benchmark from an UDS in Madrid, Spain. The results show high model accuracy and improved performance within a MPC scheme, reducing discharge and increasing treatment facilities utilization.

Abstract: Tradable Credit Schemes (TCS) promote the use of public and shared transport by capping private car usage while maintaining fair welfare outcomes by allowing credit trading. However, most existing studies assume unlimited public transit capacity or a fixed occupancy of shared modes, often neglecting waiting time and oversimplifying time-based costs by depending solely on in-vehicle travel time. These assumptions can overstate the system's performance with TCS regulation, especially when there are insufficient public or shared transport supplies.
  To address this, we develop a dynamic multimodal equilibrium model to capture operation constraints and induced waiting times under TCS regulation. The model integrates travelers' mode choices, credit trading, traffic dynamics, and waiting time, which depend on key operational features of service vehicles such as fleet size and capacity.
  Besides, most TCS studies assume fixed transport supply, overlooking supply-side responses triggered by demand shifts. Therefore, we further propose integrating adaptive supply management through the deployment of Demand-Responsive Autonomous Shuttles (DRAS) and developing a bi-level optimization framework that incorporates the equilibrium model to jointly optimize TCS design and operational strategies for the DRAS.
  We apply the framework to a section of the A10 highway near Paris, France, to examine demand-supply interactions and assess the potential benefits of jointly implementing TCS and DRAS. Numerical results demonstrate the importance of modeling operational features within multimodal equilibrium and incorporating flexible supply in TCS policies for mitigating overall generalized cost.

Abstract: For multi-vehicle complex traffic scenarios in shared spaces such as intelligent intersections, safe coordination and trajectory planning is challenging due to computational complexity. To meet this challenge, we introduce a computationally efficient method for generating collision-free trajectories along predefined vehicle paths. We reformulate a constrained minimum-time trajectory planning problem as a problem in a high-dimensional configuration space, where conflict zones are modeled by high-dimensional polyhedra constructed from two-dimensional rectangles. Still, in such a formulation, as the number of vehicles involved increases, the computational complexity increases significantly. To address this, we propose two algorithms for near-optimal local optimization that significantly reduce the computational complexity by decomposing the high-dimensional problem into a sequence of 2D graph search problems. The resulting trajectories are then incorporated into a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) framework to ensure safe and smooth vehicle motion. We furthermore show in numerical evaluation that this approach significantly outperforms existing MILP-based time-scheduling; both in terms of objective-value and computational time.

Abstract: This paper introduces a geometric theory of model error, treating true and model dynamics as geodesic flows generated by distinct affine connections on a smooth manifold. When these connections differ, the resulting trajectory discrepancy--termed the Latent Error Dynamic Response (LEDR)--acquires an intrinsic dynamical structure governed by curvature. We show that the LEDR satisfies a Jacobi-type equation, where curvature mismatch acts as an explicit forcing term. In the important case of a flat model connection, the LEDR reduces to a classical Jacobi field on the true manifold, causing Model Error Resonance (MER) to emerge under positive sectional curvature. The theory is extended to a discrete-time analogue, establishing that this geometric structure and its resonant behavior persist in sampled systems. A closed-form analysis of a sphere--plane example demonstrates that curvature can be inferred directly from the LEDR evolution. This framework provides a unified geometric interpretation of structured error dynamics and offers foundational tools for curvature-informed model validation.

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of AI-enabled systems, particularly in high-stakes domains such as autonomous driving and healthcare, has become increasingly critical. Traditional formal verification tools fall short when faced with systems that embed both opaque, black-box AI components and complex stochastic dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce LUCID (Learning-enabled Uncertainty-aware Certification of stochastIc Dynamical systems), a verification engine for certifying safety of black-box stochastic dynamical systems from a finite dataset of random state transitions. As such, LUCID is the first known tool capable of establishing quantified safety guarantees for such systems. Thanks to its modular architecture and extensive documentation, LUCID is designed for easy extensibility. LUCID employs a data-driven methodology rooted in control barrier certificates, which are learned directly from system transition data, to ensure formal safety guarantees. We use conditional mean embeddings to embed data into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), where an RKHS ambiguity set is constructed that can be inflated to robustify the result to out-of-distribution behavior. A key innovation within LUCID is its use of a finite Fourier kernel expansion to reformulate a semi-infinite non-convex optimization problem into a tractable linear program. The resulting spectral barrier allows us to leverage the fast Fourier transform to generate the relaxed problem efficiently, offering a scalable yet distributionally robust framework for verifying safety. LUCID thus offers a robust and efficient verification framework, able to handle the complexities of modern black-box systems while providing formal guarantees of safety. These unique capabilities are demonstrated on challenging benchmarks.

Abstract: The maritime sector is undergoing a disruptive technological change driven by three main factors: autonomy, decarbonization, and digital transformation. Addressing these factors necessitates a reassessment of inland vessel operations. This paper presents the design and development of a decision support system for ferry operations based on a shrinking-horizon optimal control framework. The problem formulation incorporates a mathematical model of the ferry's dynamics and environmental disturbances, specifically water currents and wind, which can significantly influence the dynamics. Real-world data and illustrative scenarios demonstrate the potential of the proposed system to effectively support ferry crews by providing real-time guidance. This enables enhanced operational efficiency while maintaining predefined maneuver durations. The findings suggest that optimal control applications hold substantial promise for advancing future ferry operations on inland waters.

Abstract: Research ultrasound platforms have enabled many next-generation imaging sequences but have lacked realtime navigation capabilities for emerging 2D arrays such as row-column arrays (RCAs). We present an open-source, GPU-accelerated reconstruction and rendering software suite integrated with a programmable ultrasound platform and novel electrostrictive Top-Orthogonal-to-Bottom-Electrode (TOBE) arrays. The system supports advanced real-time modes, including cross-plane aperture-encoded synthetic-aperture imaging and aperture-encoded volumetric scanning. TOBE-enabled methods demonstrate improved image quality and expanded field of view compared with conventional RCA techniques. The software implements beamforming and rendering kernels using OpenGL compute shaders and is designed for maximum data throughput helping to minimize stalls and latency. Accompanying sample datasets and example scripts for offline reconstruction are provided to facilitate external testing.

Abstract: This paper proposes a method that enhances the compression performance of the current model under development for the upcoming MPEG standard on Feature Coding for Machines (FCM). This standard aims at providing inter-operable compressed bitstreams of features in the context of split computing, i.e., when the inference of a large computer vision neural-network (NN)-based model is split between two devices. Intermediate features can consist of multiple 3D tensors that can be reduced and entropy coded to limit the required bandwidth of such transmission. In the envisioned design for the MPEG-FCM standard, intermediate feature tensors may be reduced using Neural layers before being converted into 2D video frames that can be coded using existing video compression standards. This paper introduces an additional channel truncation and packing method which enables the system to preserve the relevant channels, depending on the statistics of the features at inference time, while preserving the computer vision task performance at the receiver. Implemented within the MPEG-FCM test model, the proposed method yields an average reduction in rate by 10.59% for a given accuracy on multiple computer vision tasks and datasets.

Abstract: Whole-slide multiplex imaging of brain tissue generates massive information-dense images that are challenging to analyze and require custom software. We present an alternative query-driven programming-free strategy using a multiplex visual search engine (mViSE) that learns the multifaceted brain tissue chemoarchitecture, cytoarchitecture, and myeloarchitecture. Our divide-and-conquer strategy organizes the data into panels of related molecular markers and uses self-supervised learning to train a multiplex encoder for each panel with explicit visual confirmation of successful learning. Multiple panels can be combined to process visual queries for retrieving similar communities of individual cells or multicellular niches using information-theoretic methods. The retrievals can be used for diverse purposes including tissue exploration, delineating brain regions and cortical cell layers, profiling and comparing brain regions without computer programming. We validated mViSE's ability to retrieve single cells, proximal cell pairs, tissue patches, delineate cortical layers, brain regions and sub-regions. mViSE is provided as an open-source QuPath plug-in.
