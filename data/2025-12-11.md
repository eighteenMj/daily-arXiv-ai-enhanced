Abstract: Video Large Multimodal Models (VLMMs) have shown impressive performance in video understanding, yet their ability to accurately capture the temporal order of multiple events remains underexplored. We interestingly observe that, even when video frames are scrambled, models perform very well on the existing benchmarks by comprehensive experiments. This implies that VLMMs may not necessarily rely on accurate sequential processing of visual events, but instead depend on prior knowledge of typical scenarios to answer the question. To benchmark temporal understanding capabilities in VLMMs, we propose VECTOR, designed to explicitly assess a model's ability to identify the temporal order of events. On this benchmark, we observe that various VLMMs often fail to understand the orders of events. To address this, we propose MECOT (Multi-Event instruction fine-tuning with Chain-of-Thought), which (1) trains models on detailed, event-by-event video descriptions and (2) using chain-of-thought prompts at inference to enhance temporal awareness. MECOT outperforms prior arts on VECTOR as well as improving performance on existing video benchmarks, implying effectiveness of temporal understanding. We release our code, model and datasets.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent VLM-based agents aim to replicate OpenAI O3's ``thinking with images" via tool use, but most open-source methods limit input to a single image, falling short on real-world multi-image QA tasks. To address this, we propose IMAgent, an open-source vision agent trained via end-to-end reinforcement learning dedicated for complex multi-image tasks. By leveraging a multi-agent system, we generate challenging and visually-rich multi-image QA pairs to fully activate the tool-use potential of the base VLM. Through manual verification, we obtain MIFG-QA, comprising 10k samples for training and evaluation. With deeper reasoning steps, VLMs may increasingly ignore visual inputs. We therefore develop two specialized tools for visual reflection and confirmation, allowing the model to proactively reallocate its attention to image content during inference. Benefiting from our well-designed action-trajectory two-level mask strategy, IMAgent achieves stable tool use behavior via pure RL training without requiring costly supervised fine-tuning data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IMAgent maintains strong performance on existing single-image benchmarks while achieving substantial improvements on our proposed multi-image dataset, with our analysis providing actionable insights for the research community. Codes and data will be released soon.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Face recognition (FR) systems are often prone to demographic biases, partially due to the entanglement of demographic-specific information with identity-relevant features in facial embeddings. This bias is extremely critical in large multicultural cities, especially where biometrics play a major role in smart city infrastructure. The entanglement can cause demographic attributes to overshadow identity cues in the embedding space, resulting in disparities in verification performance across different demographic groups. To address this issue, we propose a novel strategy, Unified Text-Image Embedding (UTIE), which aims to induce demographic ambiguity in face embeddings by enriching them with information related to other demographic groups. This encourages face embeddings to emphasize identity-relevant features and thus promotes fairer verification performance across groups. UTIE leverages the zero-shot capabilities and cross-modal semantic alignment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Given that VLMs are naturally trained to align visual and textual representations, we enrich the facial embeddings of each demographic group with text-derived demographic features extracted from other demographic groups. This encourages a more neutral representation in terms of demographic attributes. We evaluate UTIE using three VLMs, CLIP, OpenCLIP, and SigLIP, on two widely used benchmarks, RFW and BFW, designed to assess bias in FR. Experimental results show that UTIE consistently reduces bias metrics while maintaining, or even improving in several cases, the face verification accuracy.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in low-light image enhancement through Retinex-based decomposition, yet their requirement for hundreds of iterative sampling steps severely limits practical deployment. While recent consistency models offer promising one-step generation for \textit{unconditional synthesis}, their application to \textit{conditional enhancement} remains unexplored. We present \textbf{Consist-Retinex}, the first framework adapting consistency modeling to Retinex-based low-light enhancement. Our key insight is that conditional enhancement requires fundamentally different training dynamics than unconditional generation standard consistency training focuses on low-noise regions near the data manifold, while conditional mapping critically depends on large-noise regimes that bridge degraded inputs to enhanced outputs. We introduce two core innovations: (1) a \textbf{dual-objective consistency loss} combining temporal consistency with ground-truth alignment under randomized time sampling, providing full-spectrum supervision for stable convergence; and (2) an \textbf{adaptive noise-emphasized sampling strategy} that prioritizes training on large-noise regions essential for one-step conditional generation. On VE-LOL-L, Consist-Retinex achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art performance with single-step sampling} (\textbf{PSNR: 25.51 vs. 23.41, FID: 44.73 vs. 49.59} compared to Diff-Retinex++), while requiring only \textbf{1/8 of the training budget} relative to the 1000-step Diff-Retinex baseline.

*Maoyu Wang,Yao Lu,Bo Zhou,Zhuangzhi Chen,Yun Lin,Qi Xuan,Guan Gui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 为无人机认证设计了一个层次化的频谱聚类修剪框架HSCP，将层修剪与通道修剪相结合以在压缩模型的同时维持精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统无人机身份识别方法难以在复杂环境中提取可靠的信号特征并满足实时性要求；基于深度学习的射频指纹识别方法虽有更高识别精度，但模型大、计算开销高，难以部署在资源受限的边缘设备上；现有的模型剪枝技术也难以同时优化压缩率、硬件加速和识别精度。

Method: 提出了一个分两阶段的层次化频谱聚类修剪框架（HSCP）：第一阶段，使用在以CKA作为引导的频谱聚类来识别并去除冗余的层；第二阶段，将同样的策略应用于通道维度以消除更细粒度的冗余；为了确保鲁棒性，还采用了抗噪声的微调策略。

Result: 在UAV-M100基准测试上，HSCP优于现有的通道和层剪枝方法。具体而言，在ResNet-18上，其实现了86.39%的参数减少与84.44%的FLOPs减少，且识别精度比未剪枝的基线提高了1.49%；即便在信噪比较低的环境中，模型仍保持优异的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HSCP框架通过联合层与通道剪枝，可对模型进行极端压缩，同时实现高精度且能高效推理；该框架具有在资源受限的边缘设备上高效部署无人机认证模型的潜力。

Abstract: With the rapid development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and the increasing complexity of low-altitude security threats, traditional UAV identification methods struggle to extract reliable signal features and meet real-time requirements in complex environments. Recently, deep learning based Radio Frequency Fingerprint Identification (RFFI) approaches have greatly improved recognition accuracy. However, their large model sizes and high computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. While model pruning offers a general solution for complexity reduction, existing weight, channel, and layer pruning techniques struggle to concurrently optimize compression rate, hardware acceleration, and recognition accuracy. To this end, in this paper, we introduce HSCP, a Hierarchical Spectral Clustering Pruning framework that combines layer pruning with channel pruning to achieve extreme compression, high performance, and efficient inference. In the first stage, HSCP employs spectral clustering guided by Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) to identify and remove redundant layers. Subsequently, the same strategy is applied to the channel dimension to eliminate a finer redundancy. To ensure robustness, we further employ a noise-robust fine-tuning strategy. Experiments on the UAV-M100 benchmark demonstrate that HSCP outperforms existing channel and layer pruning methods. Specifically, HSCP achieves $86.39\%$ parameter reduction and $84.44\%$ FLOPs reduction on ResNet18 while improving accuracy by $1.49\%$ compared to the unpruned baseline, and maintains superior robustness even in low signal-to-noise ratio environments.

Conclusion: RAG-HAR提供了一个强大、实用且无需训练的人类活动识别框架，突破了现有方法的限制，在实际应用中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) underpins applications in healthcare, rehabilitation, fitness tracking, and smart environments, yet existing deep learning approaches demand dataset-specific training, large labeled corpora, and significant computational resources.We introduce RAG-HAR, a training-free retrieval-augmented framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) for HAR. RAG-HAR computes lightweight statistical descriptors, retrieves semantically similar samples from a vector database, and uses this contextual evidence to make LLM-based activity identification. We further enhance RAG-HAR by first applying prompt optimization and introducing an LLM-based activity descriptor that generates context-enriched vector databases for delivering accurate and highly relevant contextual information. Along with these mechanisms, RAG-HAR achieves state-of-the-art performance across six diverse HAR benchmarks. Most importantly, RAG-HAR attains these improvements without requiring model training or fine-tuning, emphasizing its robustness and practical applicability. RAG-HAR moves beyond known behaviors, enabling the recognition and meaningful labelling of multiple unseen human activities.

Abstract: Applying general-purpose object detectors to ship detection in satellite imagery presents significant challenges due to the extreme scale disparity and morphological anisotropy of maritime targets. Standard architectures utilizing stride-32 (P5) layers often fail to resolve narrow vessels, resulting in spatial feature dilution. In this work, we propose LiM-YOLO, a specialized detector designed to resolve these domain-specific conflicts. Based on a statistical analysis of ship scales, we introduce a Pyramid Level Shift Strategy that reconfigures the detection head to P2-P4. This shift ensures compliance with Nyquist sampling criteria for small objects while eliminating the computational redundancy of deep layers. To further enhance training stability on high-resolution inputs, we incorporate a Group Normalized Convolutional Block for Linear Projection (GN-CBLinear), which mitigates gradient volatility in micro-batch settings. Validated on SODA-A, DOTA-v1.5, FAIR1M-v2.0, and ShipRSImageNet-V1, LiM-YOLO demonstrates superior detection accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art models. The code is available at https://github.com/egshkim/LiM-YOLO.

Motivation: 现有扩散和流模型中的噪声样本搜索方法虽然能随测试时间计算量提升效果，但当前的非均匀推理计算预算分配方法依赖贪心算法，计算分配效率低下，需要更好的解决方案

Method: 提出Verifier-Threshold方法，自动重新分配测试时间计算预算，优化计算资源利用。在GenEval基准测试中进行验证。

Result: 在保持相同性能水平下，相比最先进方法实现了2-4倍的计算时间缩减，效率显著提升。

Conclusion: Verifier-Threshold方法能够有效优化图像生成模型的计算资源分配，在保证生成质量的同时大幅降低计算成本，为生成式AI模型的高效部署提供了新思路。

Abstract: Image generation has emerged as a mainstream application of large generative AI models. Just as test-time compute and reasoning have helped language models improve their capabilities, similar benefits have also been observed with image generation models. In particular, searching over noise samples for diffusion and flow models has shown to scale well with test-time compute. While recent works have explored allocating non-uniform inference-compute budgets across different denoising steps, they rely on greedy algorithms and allocate the compute budget ineffectively. In this work, we study this problem and propose solutions to fix it. We propose the Verifier-Threshold method which automatically reallocates test-time compute and delivers substantial efficiency improvements. For the same performance on the GenEval benchmark, we achieve a 2-4x reduction in computational time over the state-of-the-art method.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) affects individuals with long-term diabetes. Without early diagnosis, DR can lead to vision loss. Fundus photography captures the structure of the retina along with abnormalities indicative of the stage of the disease. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can support clinicians in identifying these lesions, reducing manual workload, but models require high-quality annotated datasets. Due to the complexity of retinal structures, errors in image acquisition and lesion interpretation of manual annotators can occur. We proposed a quality-control framework, ensuring only high-standard data is used for evaluation and AI training. First, an explainable feature-based classifier is used to filter inadequate images. The features are extracted both using image processing and contrastive learning. Then, the images are enhanced and put subject to annotation, using deep-learning-based assistance. Lastly, the agreement between annotators calculated using derived formulas determines the usability of the annotations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种3D逆设计框架（3DID），通过学习统一的物理-几何嵌入来直接导航3D设计空间，采用两阶段物理感知优化策略，首先生成全局潜在流形的候选解，然后进行目标驱动的细化，从而生成高保真的3D几何结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D逆设计方法存在局限性：要么使用2D投影近似3D设计空间牺牲体积细节，要么微调现有3D形状限制设计探索，无法实现真正的从零开始3D设计。

Method: 首先学习统一的物理-几何嵌入，将形状和物理场数据压缩到连续潜在空间；然后采用两阶段物理感知优化：第一阶段使用梯度引导的扩散采样器探索全局潜在流形，第二阶段进行目标驱动、拓扑保持的细化。

Result: 3DID框架能够生成高质量、高保真的3D几何结构，在解决方案质量和设计多样性方面都优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 3DID通过在连续潜在空间中耦合物理-几何表示和两阶段优化策略，有效解决了3D逆设计中的可扩展性和保真度问题，为真实3D设计提供了新途径。

Abstract: Inverse design aims to design the input variables of a physical system to optimize a specified objective function, typically formulated as a search or optimization problem. However, in 3D domains, the design space grows exponentially, rendering exhaustive grid-based searches infeasible. Recent advances in deep learning have accelerated inverse design by providing powerful generative priors and differentiable surrogate models. Nevertheless, current methods tend to approximate the 3D design space using 2D projections or fine-tune existing 3D shapes. These approaches sacrifice volumetric detail and constrain design exploration, preventing true 3D design from scratch. In this paper, we propose a 3D Inverse Design (3DID) framework that directly navigates the 3D design space by coupling a continuous latent representation with a physics-aware optimization strategy. We first learn a unified physics-geometry embedding that compactly captures shape and physical field data in a continuous latent space. Then, we introduce a two-stage strategy to perform physics-aware optimization. In the first stage, a gradient-guided diffusion sampler explores the global latent manifold. In the second stage, an objective-driven, topology-preserving refinement further sculpts each candidate toward the target objective. This enables 3DID to generate high-fidelity 3D geometries, outperforming existing methods in both solution quality and design versatility.

Motivation: 放射治疗规划过程复杂且在不同机构和规划者之间存在显著差异。现有的大多数3D剂量预测深度学习方法依赖于参考计划作为训练标签，这会无意中让模型偏向特定的规划风格或机构偏好。

Method: 引入一种新颖的生成模型，仅基于用户定义的口味偏好来预测3D剂量分布。这些可定制的偏好使规划者能够在危及器官和计划靶区之间优先考虑特定的权衡，提供更高的灵活性和个性化。该方法设计用于与临床治疗规划系统无缝集成。

Conclusion: 该方法通过用户驱动的偏好系统提供了更灵活的放射治疗规划解决方案，能够生成高质量的个性化计划，并有效避免传统方法对训练数据中特定规划风格的偏差。

Abstract: Radiotherapy planning is a highly complex process that often varies significantly across institutions and individual planners. Most existing deep learning approaches for 3D dose prediction rely on reference plans as ground truth during training, which can inadvertently bias models toward specific planning styles or institutional preferences. In this study, we introduce a novel generative model that predicts 3D dose distributions based solely on user-defined preference flavors. These customizable preferences enable planners to prioritize specific trade-offs between organs-at-risk (OARs) and planning target volumes (PTVs), offering greater flexibility and personalization. Designed for seamless integration with clinical treatment planning systems, our approach assists users in generating high-quality plans efficiently. Comparative evaluations demonstrate that our method can surpasses the Varian RapidPlan model in both adaptability and plan quality in some scenarios.

Motivation: 现有监督方法因依赖有限成对数据性能不稳定，无监督方法缺乏有效物理几何整合和先验知识利用，需更可靠临床适用方法。

Result: 仿真和临床数据实验验证方法有效性和泛化能力，在无成对数据下仍保持优异性能。

Conclusion: 方法在金属伪影去除任务中表现优越，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) images are often severely corrupted by artifacts in the presence of metals. Existing supervised metal artifact reduction (MAR) approaches suffer from performance instability on known data due to their reliance on limited paired metal-clean data, which limits their clinical applicability. Moreover, existing unsupervised methods face two main challenges: 1) the CT physical geometry is not effectively incorporated into the MAR process to ensure data fidelity; 2) traditional heuristics regularization terms cannot fully capture the abundant prior knowledge available. To overcome these shortcomings, we propose diffusion model regularized implicit neural representation framework for MAR. The implicit neural representation integrates physical constraints and imposes data fidelity, while the pre-trained diffusion model provides prior knowledge to regularize the solution. Experimental results on both simulated and clinical data demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our method, highlighting its potential to be applied to clinical settings.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The efficacy of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in micro/nano manufacturing is fundamentally constrained by the scarcity of high-quality and physically grounded training data for defect inspection. Lithography defect data from semiconductor industry are rarely accessible for research use, resulting in a shortage of publicly available datasets. To address this bottleneck in lithography, this study proposes a novel methodology for generating large-scale, physically valid defect datasets with pixel-level annotations. The framework begins with the ab initio synthesis of defect layouts using controllable, physics-constrained mathematical morphology operations (erosion and dilation) applied to the original design-level layout. These synthesized layouts, together with their defect-free counterparts, are fabricated into physical samples via high-fidelity digital micromirror device (DMD)-based lithography. Optical micrographs of the synthesized defect samples and their defect-free references are then compared to create consistent defect delineation annotations. Using this methodology, we constructed a comprehensive dataset of 3,530 Optical micrographs containing 13,365 annotated defect instances including four classes: bridge, burr, pinch, and contamination. Each defect instance is annotated with a pixel-accurate segmentation mask, preserving full contour and geometry. The segmentation-based Mask R-CNN achieves AP@0.5 of 0.980, 0.965, and 0.971, compared with 0.740, 0.719, and 0.717 for Faster R-CNN on bridge, burr, and pinch classes, representing a mean AP@0.5 improvement of approximately 34%. For the contamination class, Mask R-CNN achieves an AP@0.5 roughly 42% higher than Faster R-CNN. These consistent gains demonstrate that our proposed methodology to generate defect datasets with pixel-level annotations is feasible for robust AI-based Measurement/Inspection (MI) in semiconductor fabrication.

Abstract: The proliferation of satellite constellations, coupled with reduced tasking latency and diverse sensor capabilities, has expanded the opportunities for automated Earth observation. This paper introduces a fully automated Tip-and-Cue framework designed for satellite imaging tasking and scheduling. In this context, tips are generated from external data sources or analyses of prior satellite imagery, identifying spatiotemporal targets and prioritizing them for downstream planning. Corresponding cues are the imaging tasks formulated in response, which incorporate sensor constraints, timing requirements, and utility functions. The system autonomously generates candidate tasks, optimizes their scheduling across multiple satellites using continuous utility functions that reflect the expected value of each observation, and processes the resulting imagery using artificial-intelligence-based models, including object detectors and vision-language models. Structured visual reports are generated to support both interpretability and the identification of new insights for downstream tasking. The efficacy of the framework is demonstrated through a maritime vessel tracking scenario, utilizing Automatic Identification System (AIS) data for trajectory prediction, targeted observations, and the generation of actionable outputs. Maritime vessel tracking is a widely researched application, often used to benchmark novel approaches to satellite tasking, forecasting, and analysis. The system is extensible to broader applications such as smart-city monitoring and disaster response, where timely tasking and automated analysis are critical.

Abstract: Body and face motion play an integral role in communication. They convey crucial information on the participants. Advances in generative modeling and multi-modal learning have enabled motion generation from signals such as speech, conversational context and visual cues. However, generating expressive and coherent face and body dynamics remains challenging due to the complex interplay of verbal / non-verbal cues and individual personality traits. This survey reviews body and face motion generation, covering core concepts, representations techniques, generative approaches, datasets and evaluation metrics. We highlight future directions to enhance the realism, coherence and expressiveness of avatars in dyadic settings. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first comprehensive review to cover both body and face motion. Detailed resources are listed on https://lownish23csz0010.github.io/mogen/.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Visual language models encounter challenges in computational efficiency and latency, primarily due to the substantial redundancy in the token representations of high-resolution images and videos. Current attention/similarity-based compression algorithms suffer from either position bias or class imbalance, leading to significant accuracy degradation. They also fail to generalize to shallow LLM layers, which exhibit weaker cross-modal interactions. To address this, we extend token compression to the visual encoder through an effective iterative merging scheme that is orthogonal in spatial axes to accelerate the computation across the entire VLM. Furthermoer, we integrate a spectrum pruning unit into LLM through an attention/similarity-free low-pass filter, which gradually prunes redundant visual tokens and is fully compatible to modern FlashAttention. On this basis, we propose Lossless Ultimate Vision tokens Compression (LUVC) framework. LUVC systematically compresses visual tokens until complete elimination at the final layer of LLM, so that the high-dimensional visual features are gradually fused into the multimodal queries. The experiments show that LUVC achieves a 2 speedup inference in language model with negligible accuracy degradation, and the training-free characteristic enables immediate deployment across multiple VLMs.

Abstract: Event cameras have the potential to revolutionize vision systems with their high temporal resolution and dynamic range, yet they remain susceptible to lens flare, a fundamental optical artifact that causes severe degradation. In event streams, this optical artifact forms a complex, spatio-temporal distortion that has been largely overlooked. We present E-Deflare, the first systematic framework for removing lens flare from event camera data. We first establish the theoretical foundation by deriving a physics-grounded forward model of the non-linear suppression mechanism. This insight enables the creation of the E-Deflare Benchmark, a comprehensive resource featuring a large-scale simulated training set, E-Flare-2.7K, and the first-ever paired real-world test set, E-Flare-R, captured by our novel optical system. Empowered by this benchmark, we design E-DeflareNet, which achieves state-of-the-art restoration performance. Extensive experiments validate our approach and demonstrate clear benefits for downstream tasks. Code and datasets are publicly available.

Method: 利用视觉语言模型创建开放词汇的3D概念图，其中每个点都被标记为基于显着性图导出的概念向量，通过建立概念图之间鲁棒的3D-3D对应关系来估计6DoF相对姿态。

Result: 在没有进行任何物体或数据集特定训练的情况下，在常见的零样本相对姿态估计基准测试中取得了最先进的结果，在ADD(-S)分数上显著超过现有方法超过62%。

Conclusion: ConceptPose成功桥接了传统姿态估计方法和视觉语言模型的零样本能力，实现了无需特定训练的姿态估计，为计算机视觉和机器人学中的物体姿态估计提供了一种新的有效方法。

Abstract: Object pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision and robotics, yet most methods require extensive, dataset-specific training. Concurrently, large-scale vision language models show remarkable zero-shot capabilities. In this work, we bridge these two worlds by introducing ConceptPose, a framework for object pose estimation that is both training-free and model-free. ConceptPose leverages a vision-language-model (VLM) to create open-vocabulary 3D concept maps, where each point is tagged with a concept vector derived from saliency maps. By establishing robust 3D-3D correspondences across concept maps, our approach allows precise estimation of 6DoF relative pose. Without any object or dataset-specific training, our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on common zero shot relative pose estimation benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing methods by over 62% in ADD(-S) score, including those that utilize extensive dataset-specific training.

*Seongyong Kim,Yong Kwon Cho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SIP（Site in Pieces）是一个构建环境中三维场景理解的数据集，旨在反映LiDAR数据采集的实际约束，包括室内外场景、点级注释和适合施工环境的分类体系。


<details>

Method: 使用地面LiDAR扫描仪采集室内外场景，采用针对施工环境设计的分类体系（A. 建筑环境；B. 施工操作；C. 场地周边）进行点级注释，并通过扫描协议、标注流程和质量控制确保数据一致性。

Result: SIP数据集公开可用，包含结构组件和细长临时对象（如脚手架、管道、升降机），并保留真实传感特征（如径向密度衰减、碎片化几何），支持三维深度学习框架的灵活适配。

Conclusion: SIP通过提供保留真实世界传感特征的现场数据，能够推动面向施工的三维视觉任务，并支持鲁棒的基准测试。

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene interpretation in active construction sites is essential for progress monitoring, safety assessment, and digital twin development. LiDAR is widely used in construction because it offers advantages over camera-based systems, performing reliably in cluttered and dynamically changing conditions. Yet most public datasets for 3D perception are derived from densely fused scans with uniform sampling and complete visibility, conditions that do not reflect real construction sites. Field data are often collected as isolated single-station LiDAR views, constrained by safety requirements, limited access, and ongoing operations. These factors lead to radial density decay, fragmented geometry, and view-dependent visibility-characteristics that remain underrepresented in existing datasets. This paper presents SIP, Site in Pieces, a dataset created to reflect the practical constraints of LiDAR acquisition during construction. SIP provides indoor and outdoor scenes captured with a terrestrial LiDAR scanner and annotated at the point level using a taxonomy tailored to construction environments: A. Built Environment, B. Construction Operations, and C. Site Surroundings. The dataset includes both structural components and slender temporary objects such as scaffolding, MEP piping, and scissor lifts, where sparsity caused by occlusion and fragmented geometry make segmentation particularly challenging. The scanning protocol, annotation workflow, and quality control procedures establish a consistent foundation for the dataset. SIP is openly available with a supporting Git repository, offering adaptable class configurations that streamline adoption within modern 3D deep learning frameworks. By providing field data that retain real-world sensing characteristics, SIP enables robust benchmarking and contributes to advancing construction-oriented 3D vision tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 年龄相关性黄斑变性和脉络膜新生血管相关疾病是全球视力丧失的主要原因，光学相干断层扫描是其早期检测和管理的关键工具。然而，当前最先进的深度学习模型（如ConvNeXtV2-Large）在临床部署时面临计算资源要求高的挑战。因此需要开发既保持高诊断性能又能实现实时部署的高效模型。

Conclusion: KD-OCT框架成功地将高性能OCT分类模型压缩为适合临床边缘部署的轻量级版本，在保持诊断准确性的同时实现了计算效率的提升，为AMD筛查的实时应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and choroidal neovascularization (CNV)-related conditions are leading causes of vision loss worldwide, with optical coherence tomography (OCT) serving as a cornerstone for early detection and management. However, deploying state-of-the-art deep learning models like ConvNeXtV2-Large in clinical settings is hindered by their computational demands. Therefore, it is desirable to develop efficient models that maintain high diagnostic performance while enabling real-time deployment. In this study, a novel knowledge distillation framework, termed KD-OCT, is proposed to compress a high-performance ConvNeXtV2-Large teacher model, enhanced with advanced augmentations, stochastic weight averaging, and focal loss, into a lightweight EfficientNet-B2 student for classifying normal, drusen, and CNV cases. KD-OCT employs real-time distillation with a combined loss balancing soft teacher knowledge transfer and hard ground-truth supervision. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on the Noor Eye Hospital (NEH) dataset using patient-level cross-validation. Experimental results demonstrate that KD-OCT outperforms comparable multi-scale or feature-fusion OCT classifiers in efficiency- accuracy balance, achieving near-teacher performance with substantial reductions in model size and inference time. Despite the compression, the student model exceeds most existing frameworks, facilitating edge deployment for AMD screening. Code is available at https://github.com/erfan-nourbakhsh/KD- OCT.

TL;DR: 本文提出一种基于'负'高斯混合统计的自适应阈值方法，用于视觉地点识别(VPR)中的匹配阈值选择，以应对不同视觉场景下的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VPR方法通常依赖手动设置阈值来判断匹配质量，但不同季节、天气、光照和结构变化等因素导致图像外观差异大，难以找到一个能在多种视觉场景下通用的固定阈值。

Method: 通过分析地点图像'负'高斯混合统计量（即识别非该地点的图像统计特征），构建自适应阈值选择机制，无需手动调参。

Result: 该方法在不同图像数据库和图像描述符上均能选择出有效阈值，提升了VPR系统的鲁棒性和实用性。

Conclusion: 基于'负'高斯混合统计的自适应阈值选择是一种有效解决VPR阈值调优问题的实用方法，能够适应多样化的视觉场景变化。

Abstract: Visual place recognition (VPR) is an important component technology for camera-based mapping and navigation applications. This is a challenging problem because images of the same place may appear quite different for reasons including seasonal changes, weather illumination, structural changes to the environment, as well as transient pedestrian or vehicle traffic. Papers focusing on generating image descriptors for VPR report their results using metrics such as recall@K and ROC curves. However, for a robot implementation, determining which matches are sufficiently good is often reduced to a manually set threshold. And it is difficult to manually select a threshold that will work for a variety of visual scenarios. This paper addresses the problem of automatically selecting a threshold for VPR by looking at the 'negative' Gaussian mixture statistics for a place - image statistics indicating not this place. We show that this approach can be used to select thresholds that work well for a variety of image databases and image descriptors.

Abstract: Text-to-image generative models have achieved remarkable visual quality but still struggle with compositionality$-$accurately capturing object relationships, attribute bindings, and fine-grained details in prompts. A key limitation is that models are not explicitly trained to differentiate between compositionally similar prompts and images, resulting in outputs that are close to the intended description yet deviate in fine-grained details. To address this, we propose AgentComp, a framework that explicitly trains models to better differentiate such compositional variations and enhance their reasoning ability. AgentComp leverages the reasoning and tool-use capabilities of large language models equipped with image generation, editing, and VQA tools to autonomously construct compositional datasets. Using these datasets, we apply an agentic preference optimization method to fine-tune text-to-image models, enabling them to better distinguish between compositionally similar samples and resulting in overall stronger compositional generation ability. AgentComp achieves state-of-the-art results on compositionality benchmarks such as T2I-CompBench, without compromising image quality$-$a common drawback in prior approaches$-$and even generalizes to other capabilities not explicitly trained for, such as text rendering.

Abstract: Underground mining disasters produce pervasive darkness, dust, and collapses that obscure vision and make situational awareness difficult for humans and conventional systems. To address this, we propose MDSE, Multimodal Disaster Situation Explainer, a novel vision-language framework that automatically generates detailed textual explanations of post-disaster underground scenes. MDSE has three-fold innovations: (i) Context-Aware Cross-Attention for robust alignment of visual and textual features even under severe degradation; (ii) Segmentation-aware dual pathway visual encoding that fuses global and region-specific embeddings; and (iii) Resource-Efficient Transformer-Based Language Model for expressive caption generation with minimal compute cost. To support this task, we present the Underground Mine Disaster (UMD) dataset--the first image-caption corpus of real underground disaster scenes--enabling rigorous training and evaluation. Extensive experiments on UMD and related benchmarks show that MDSE substantially outperforms state-of-the-art captioning models, producing more accurate and contextually relevant descriptions that capture crucial details in obscured environments, improving situational awareness for underground emergency response.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Generating realistic food images for categories with multiple nouns is surprisingly challenging. For instance, the prompt "egg noodle" may result in images that incorrectly contain both eggs and noodles as separate entities. Multi-noun food categories are common in real-world datasets and account for a large portion of entries in benchmarks such as UEC-256. These compound names often cause generative models to misinterpret the semantics, producing unintended ingredients or objects. This is due to insufficient multi-noun category related knowledge in the text encoder and misinterpretation of multi-noun relationships, leading to incorrect spatial layouts. To overcome these challenges, we propose FoCULR (Food Category Understanding and Layout Refinement) which incorporates food domain knowledge and introduces core concepts early in the generation process. Experimental results demonstrate that the integration of these techniques improves image generation performance in the food domain.

Abstract: Recent progress in text-to-video generation has achieved remarkable realism, yet fine-grained control over camera motion and orientation remains elusive. Existing approaches typically encode camera trajectories through relative or ambiguous representations, limiting explicit geometric control. We introduce GimbalDiffusion, a framework that enables camera control grounded in physical-world coordinates, using gravity as a global reference. Instead of describing motion relative to previous frames, our method defines camera trajectories in an absolute coordinate system, allowing precise and interpretable control over camera parameters without requiring an initial reference frame. We leverage panoramic 360-degree videos to construct a wide variety of camera trajectories, well beyond the predominantly straight, forward-facing trajectories seen in conventional video data. To further enhance camera guidance, we introduce null-pitch conditioning, an annotation strategy that reduces the model's reliance on text content when conflicting with camera specifications (e.g., generating grass while the camera points towards the sky). Finally, we establish a benchmark for camera-aware video generation by rebalancing SpatialVID-HQ for comprehensive evaluation under wide camera pitch variation. Together, these contributions advance the controllability and robustness of text-to-video models, enabling precise, gravity-aligned camera manipulation within generative frameworks.

Abstract: High-resolution imagery is often hindered by limitations in sensor technology, atmospheric conditions, and costs. Such challenges occur in satellite remote sensing, but also with handheld cameras, such as our smartphones. Hence, super-resolution aims to enhance the image resolution algorithmically. Since single-image super-resolution requires solving an inverse problem, such methods must exploit strong priors, e.g. learned from high-resolution training data, or be constrained by auxiliary data, e.g. by a high-resolution guide from another modality. While qualitatively pleasing, such approaches often lead to "hallucinated" structures that do not match reality. In contrast, multi-image super-resolution (MISR) aims to improve the (optical) resolution by constraining the super-resolution process with multiple views taken with sub-pixel shifts. Here, we propose SuperF, a test-time optimization approach for MISR that leverages coordinate-based neural networks, also called neural fields. Their ability to represent continuous signals with an implicit neural representation (INR) makes them an ideal fit for the MISR task.
  The key characteristic of our approach is to share an INR for multiple shifted low-resolution frames and to jointly optimize the frame alignment with the INR. Our approach advances related INR baselines, adopted from burst fusion for layer separation, by directly parameterizing the sub-pixel alignment as optimizable affine transformation parameters and by optimizing via a super-sampled coordinate grid that corresponds to the output resolution. Our experiments yield compelling results on simulated bursts of satellite imagery and ground-level images from handheld cameras, with upsampling factors of up to 8. A key advantage of SuperF is that this approach does not rely on any high-resolution training data.

Motivation: 目前冠脉造影评估病变依赖人工判读、变异性大，现有无导丝的生理学工具（如QFR）常与解剖分析、虚拟介入规划分离，临床工作流不顺畅。

Method: 开发一套完整的血管造影衍生QFR系统，包括基于深度学习的狭窄自动检测、管腔分割、中心线提取，计算相对血流容量的逐毫米谱曲线，并支持虚拟支架置入后自动重新计算QFR。

Result: 在100支血管中，AngioAI-QFR与金标准FFR高度相关（r=0.89），诊断FFR≤0.80的AUC为0.93，自动化完成率达93%，中位数计算时间约41秒。能力曲线能识别局灶性和弥漫性病变，虚拟支架置入预测局灶性病变获益更大。

Conclusion: AngioAI‑QFR 提供了一个实用、近实时的血管造影处理流程，将视觉分析、功能性血流评估和虚拟介入规划统一于自动化无导丝生理评估，有望提升冠脉病变的功能评估效率和准确性。

Abstract: Coronary angiography is the main tool for assessing coronary artery disease, but visual grading of stenosis is variable and only moderately related to ischaemia. Wire based fractional flow reserve (FFR) improves lesion selection but is not used systematically. Angiography derived indices such as quantitative flow ratio (QFR) offer wire free physiology, yet many tools are workflow intensive and separate from automated anatomy analysis and virtual PCI planning. We developed AngioAI-QFR, an end to end angiography only pipeline combining deep learning stenosis detection, lumen segmentation, centreline and diameter extraction, per millimetre Relative Flow Capacity profiling, and virtual stenting with automatic recomputation of angiography derived QFR. The system was evaluated in 100 consecutive vessels with invasive FFR as reference. Primary endpoints were agreement with FFR (correlation, mean absolute error) and diagnostic performance for FFR <= 0.80. On held out frames, stenosis detection achieved precision 0.97 and lumen segmentation Dice 0.78. Across 100 vessels, AngioAI-QFR correlated strongly with FFR (r = 0.89, MAE 0.045). The AUC for detecting FFR <= 0.80 was 0.93, with sensitivity 0.88 and specificity 0.86. The pipeline completed fully automatically in 93 percent of vessels, with median time to result 41 s. RFC profiling distinguished focal from diffuse capacity loss, and virtual stenting predicted larger QFR gain in focal than in diffuse disease. AngioAI-QFR provides a practical, near real time pipeline that unifies computer vision, functional profiling, and virtual PCI with automated angiography derived physiology.

Abstract: Recent advancements in Gaussian Splatting have enabled increasingly accurate reconstruction of photorealistic head avatars, opening the door to numerous applications in visual effects, videoconferencing, and virtual reality. This, however, comes with the lack of intuitive editability offered by traditional triangle mesh-based methods. In contrast, we propose a method that combines the accuracy and fidelity of 2D Gaussian Splatting with the intuitiveness of UV texture mapping. By embedding each canonical Gaussian primitive's local frame into a patch in the UV space of a template mesh in a computationally efficient manner, we reconstruct continuous editable material head textures from a single monocular video on a conventional UV domain. Furthermore, we leverage an efficient physically based reflectance model to enable relighting and editing of these intrinsic material maps. Through extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, we demonstrate the accuracy of our reconstructions, the quality of our relighting results, and the ability to provide intuitive controls for modifying an avatar's appearance and geometry via texture mapping without additional optimization.

Conclusion: 该工作实现了从单张图像创建包含多尺度内容的3D场景，支持用户‘放大’3D区域并自回归合成先前不存在的精细细节

Abstract: We present WonderZoom, a novel approach to generating 3D scenes with contents across multiple spatial scales from a single image. Existing 3D world generation models remain limited to single-scale synthesis and cannot produce coherent scene contents at varying granularities. The fundamental challenge is the lack of a scale-aware 3D representation capable of generating and rendering content with largely different spatial sizes. WonderZoom addresses this through two key innovations: (1) scale-adaptive Gaussian surfels for generating and real-time rendering of multi-scale 3D scenes, and (2) a progressive detail synthesizer that iteratively generates finer-scale 3D contents. Our approach enables users to "zoom into" a 3D region and auto-regressively synthesize previously non-existent fine details from landscapes to microscopic features. Experiments demonstrate that WonderZoom significantly outperforms state-of-the-art video and 3D models in both quality and alignment, enabling multi-scale 3D world creation from a single image. We show video results and an interactive viewer of generated multi-scale 3D worlds in https://wonderzoom.github.io/

Abstract: We tackle continual adaptation of vision-language models to new attributes, objects, and their compositions in Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL), while preventing forgetting of prior knowledge. Unlike classical continual learning where classes are disjoint, CCZSL is more complex as attributes and objects may reoccur across sessions while compositions remain unique. Built on a frozen VLM backbone, we propose the first Prompt-based Continual Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (PromptCCZSL) framework that retains prior knowledge through recency-weighted multi-teacher distillation. It employs session-aware compositional prompts to fuse multimodal features for new compositions, while attribute and object prompts are learned through session-agnostic fusion to maintain global semantic consistency, which is further stabilized by a Cosine Anchor Loss (CAL) to preserve prior knowledge. To enhance adaptation in the current session, an Orthogonal Projection Loss (OPL) ensures that new attribute and object embeddings remain distinct from previous ones, preventing overlap, while an Intra-Session Diversity Loss (IDL) promotes variation among current-session embeddings for richer, more discriminative representations. We also introduce a comprehensive protocol that jointly measures catastrophic forgetting and compositional generalization. Extensive experiments on UT-Zappos and C-GQA benchmarks demonstrate that PromptCCZSL achieves substantial improvements over prior VLM-based and non-VLM baselines, setting a new benchmark for CCZSL in closed-world settings.

Conclusion: Δ-LFM是一个建模患者特异性潜在进展的框架，通过流匹配和潜在对齐实现，能更好地捕捉疾病的本质动态增强可解释性

Abstract: Understanding disease progression is a central clinical challenge with direct implications for early diagnosis and personalized treatment. While recent generative approaches have attempted to model progression, key mismatches remain: disease dynamics are inherently continuous and monotonic, yet latent representations are often scattered, lacking semantic structure, and diffusion-based models disrupt continuity with random denoising process. In this work, we propose to treat the disease dynamic as a velocity field and leverage Flow Matching (FM) to align the temporal evolution of patient data. Unlike prior methods, it captures the intrinsic dynamic of disease, making the progression more interpretable. However, a key challenge remains: in latent space, Auto-Encoders (AEs) do not guarantee alignment across patients or correlation with clinical-severity indicators (e.g., age and disease conditions). To address this, we propose to learn patient-specific latent alignment, which enforces patient trajectories to lie along a specific axis, with magnitude increasing monotonically with disease severity. This leads to a consistent and semantically meaningful latent space. Together, we present $Δ$-LFM, a framework for modeling patient-specific latent progression with flow matching. Across three longitudinal MRI benchmarks, $Δ$-LFM demonstrates strong empirical performance and, more importantly, offers a new framework for interpreting and visualizing disease dynamics.

Abstract: 3D visual grounding (3DVG) identifies objects in 3D scenes from language descriptions. Existing zero-shot approaches leverage 2D vision-language models (VLMs) by converting 3D spatial information (SI) into forms amenable to VLM processing, typically as composite inputs such as specified view renderings or video sequences with overlaid object markers. However, this VLM + SI paradigm yields entangled visual representations that compel the VLM to process entire cluttered cues, making it hard to exploit spatial semantic relationships effectively. In this work, we propose a new VLM x SI paradigm that externalizes the 3D SI into a form enabling the VLM to incrementally retrieve only what it needs during reasoning. We instantiate this paradigm with a novel View-on-Graph (VoG) method, which organizes the scene into a multi-modal, multi-layer scene graph and allows the VLM to operate as an active agent that selectively accesses necessary cues as it traverses the scene. This design offers two intrinsic advantages: (i) by structuring 3D context into a spatially and semantically coherent scene graph rather than confounding the VLM with densely entangled visual inputs, it lowers the VLM's reasoning difficulty; and (ii) by actively exploring and reasoning over the scene graph, it naturally produces transparent, step-by-step traces for interpretable 3DVG. Extensive experiments show that VoG achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, establishing structured scene exploration as a promising strategy for advancing zero-shot 3DVG.

Abstract: The split-inference paradigm divides an artificial intelligence (AI) model into two parts. This necessitates the transfer of intermediate feature data between the two halves. Here, effective compression of the feature data becomes vital. In this paper, we employ Z-score normalization to efficiently recover the compressed feature data at the decoder side. To examine the efficacy of our method, the proposed method is integrated into the latest Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) codec standard under development by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG). Our method supersedes the existing scaling method used by the current standard under development. It both reduces the overhead bits and improves the end-task accuracy. To further reduce the overhead in certain circumstances, we also propose a simplified method. Experiments show that using our proposed method shows 17.09% reduction in bitrate on average across different tasks and up to 65.69% for object tracking without sacrificing the task accuracy.

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have greatly improved image generation and editing, yet generating or reconstructing layered PSD files with transparent alpha channels remains highly challenging. We propose OmniPSD, a unified diffusion framework built upon the Flux ecosystem that enables both text-to-PSD generation and image-to-PSD decomposition through in-context learning. For text-to-PSD generation, OmniPSD arranges multiple target layers spatially into a single canvas and learns their compositional relationships through spatial attention, producing semantically coherent and hierarchically structured layers. For image-to-PSD decomposition, it performs iterative in-context editing, progressively extracting and erasing textual and foreground components to reconstruct editable PSD layers from a single flattened image. An RGBA-VAE is employed as an auxiliary representation module to preserve transparency without affecting structure learning. Extensive experiments on our new RGBA-layered dataset demonstrate that OmniPSD achieves high-fidelity generation, structural consistency, and transparency awareness, offering a new paradigm for layered design generation and decomposition with diffusion transformers.

Abstract: Glacial lake monitoring bears great significance in mitigating the anticipated risk of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods. However, existing segmentation methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), remain constrained to pixel-level predictions, lacking high-level global scene semantics and human-interpretable reasoning. To address this, we introduce GLACIA (\textbf{G}lacial \textbf{LA}ke segmentation with \textbf{C}ontextual \textbf{I}nstance \textbf{A}wareness), the first framework that integrates large language models with segmentation capabilities to produce both accurate segmentation masks and corresponding spatial reasoning outputs. We construct the Glacial Lake Position Reasoning (GLake-Pos) dataset pipeline, which provides diverse, spatially grounded question-answer pairs designed to overcome the lack of instance-aware positional reasoning data in remote sensing. Comparative evaluation demonstrate that GLACIA (mIoU: 87.30) surpasses state-of-the-art method based on CNNs (mIoU: 78.55 - 79.01), ViTs (mIoU: 69.27 - 81.75), Geo-foundation models (mIoU: 76.37 - 87.10), and reasoning based segmentation methods (mIoU: 60.12 - 75.66). Our approach enables intuitive disaster preparedness and informed policy-making in the context of rapidly changing glacial environments by facilitating natural language interaction, thereby supporting more efficient and interpretable decision-making.

TL;DR: MoRel是一种基于锚点中继双向混合机制的4D高斯泼溅框架，用于内存高效且时序一致地重建长范围动态场景，解决了现有方法的内存爆炸、时序闪烁和遮挡处理问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的4D高斯泼溅方法在建模长范围动态视频时存在严重内存爆炸、时序闪烁现象，并且无法处理随时间变化的遮挡出现或消失问题，需要一种能够保持时序一致性同时控制内存使用的方法

Method: 提出MoRel框架，包含：1)锚点中继的双向混合机制，在关键帧时间索引处构建局部规范锚点空间，建模锚点级别的帧间变形；2)可学习透明度控制的双向变形混合；3)基于特征方差的分层致密化方案，在保持渲染质量的同时有效致密化关键帧锚点

Result: 在新建的长范围4D动态数据集SelfCap_LR上验证，MoRel实现了时序一致、无闪烁的长范围4D重建，同时保持了有限的内存使用，相比之前的数据集，新数据集具有更大的平均动态运动幅度和更宽的空间范围

Conclusion: MoRel通过锚点中继机制解决了长范围动态建模的关键挑战，在动态高斯表示中展示了可扩展性和效率，实现了高性能的长期动态场景重建

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) have extended the high-speed rendering capability of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) into the temporal domain, enabling real-time rendering of dynamic scenes. However, one of the major remaining challenges lies in modeling long-range motion-contained dynamic videos, where a naive extension of existing methods leads to severe memory explosion, temporal flickering, and failure to handle appearing or disappearing occlusions over time. To address these challenges, we propose a novel 4DGS framework characterized by an Anchor Relay-based Bidirectional Blending (ARBB) mechanism, named MoRel, which enables temporally consistent and memory-efficient modeling of long-range dynamic scenes. Our method progressively constructs locally canonical anchor spaces at key-frame time index and models inter-frame deformations at the anchor level, enhancing temporal coherence. By learning bidirectional deformations between KfA and adaptively blending them through learnable opacity control, our approach mitigates temporal discontinuities and flickering artifacts. We further introduce a Feature-variance-guided Hierarchical Densification (FHD) scheme that effectively densifies KfA's while keeping rendering quality, based on an assigned level of feature-variance. To effectively evaluate our model's capability to handle real-world long-range 4D motion, we newly compose long-range 4D motion-contained dataset, called SelfCap$_{\text{LR}}$. It has larger average dynamic motion magnitude, captured at spatially wider spaces, compared to previous dynamic video datasets. Overall, our MoRel achieves temporally coherent and flicker-free long-range 4D reconstruction while maintaining bounded memory usage, demonstrating both scalability and efficiency in dynamic Gaussian-based representations.

Abstract: The increasing popularity of long Text-to-Image (T2I) generation has created an urgent need for automatic and interpretable models that can evaluate the image-text alignment in long prompt scenarios. However, the existing T2I alignment benchmarks predominantly focus on short prompt scenarios and only provide MOS or Likert scale annotations. This inherent limitation hinders the development of long T2I evaluators, particularly in terms of the interpretability of alignment. In this study, we contribute LongT2IBench, which comprises 14K long text-image pairs accompanied by graph-structured human annotations. Given the detail-intensive nature of long prompts, we first design a Generate-Refine-Qualify annotation protocol to convert them into textual graph structures that encompass entities, attributes, and relations. Through this transformation, fine-grained alignment annotations are achieved based on these granular elements. Finally, the graph-structed annotations are converted into alignment scores and interpretations to facilitate the design of T2I evaluation models. Based on LongT2IBench, we further propose LongT2IExpert, a LongT2I evaluator that enables multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) to provide both quantitative scores and structured interpretations through an instruction-tuning process with Hierarchical Alignment Chain-of-Thought (CoT). Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LongT2IExpert in alignment evaluation and interpretation. Data and code have been released in https://welldky.github.io/LongT2IBench-Homepage/.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD), a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, significantly affects patients' daily functioning and social interactions. To facilitate a more efficient and accessible diagnostic approach for PD, we propose a dynamic facial expression analysis-based PD auxiliary diagnosis method. This method targets hypomimia, a characteristic clinical symptom of PD, by analyzing two manifestations: reduced facial expressivity and facial rigidity, thereby facilitating the diagnosis process. We develop a multimodal facial expression analysis network to extract expression intensity features during patients' performance of various facial expressions. This network leverages the CLIP architecture to integrate visual and textual features while preserving the temporal dynamics of facial expressions. Subsequently, the expression intensity features are processed and input into an LSTM-based classification network for PD diagnosis. Our method achieves an accuracy of 93.1%, outperforming other in-vitro PD diagnostic approaches. This technique offers a more convenient detection method for potential PD patients, improving their diagnostic experience.

Abstract: Single-channel 3D reconstruction is widely used in fields such as robotics and medical imaging. While this line of work excels at reconstructing 3D geometry, the outputs are not colored 3D models, thus 3D colorization is required for visualization. Recent 3D colorization studies address this problem by distilling 2D image colorization models. However, these approaches suffer from an inherent inconsistency of 2D image models. This results in colors being averaged during training, leading to monotonous and oversimplified results, particularly in complex 360° scenes. In contrast, we aim to preserve color diversity by generating a new set of consistently colorized training views, thereby bypassing the averaging process. Nevertheless, eliminating the averaging process introduces a new challenge: ensuring strict multi-view consistency across these colorized views. To achieve this, we propose LoGoColor, a pipeline designed to preserve color diversity by eliminating this guidance-averaging process with a `Local-Global' approach: we partition the scene into subscenes and explicitly tackle both inter-subscene and intra-subscene consistency using a fine-tuned multi-view diffusion model. We demonstrate that our method achieves quantitatively and qualitatively more consistent and plausible 3D colorization on complex 360° scenes than existing methods, and validate its superior color diversity using a novel Color Diversity Index.

Conclusion: 数据均衡调度和MoE驱动的任务自适应扩散先验分配策略能有效提升图像修复基础模型的泛化能力和综合性能

Abstract: Recent studies have witnessed significant advances in image restoration foundation models driven by improvements in the scale and quality of pre-training data. In this work, we find that the data mixture proportions from different restoration tasks are also a critical factor directly determining the overall performance of all-in-one image restoration models. To this end, we propose a high-capacity diffusion-based image restoration foundation model, FoundIR-v2, which adopts a data equilibrium scheduling paradigm to dynamically optimize the proportions of mixed training datasets from different tasks. By leveraging the data mixing law, our method ensures a balanced dataset composition, enabling the model to achieve consistent generalization and comprehensive performance across diverse tasks. Furthermore, we introduce an effective Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-driven scheduler into generative pre-training to flexibly allocate task-adaptive diffusion priors for each restoration task, accounting for the distinct degradation forms and levels exhibited by different tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can address over 50 sub-tasks across a broader scope of real-world scenarios and achieves favorable performance against state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Automated skin lesion classification using deep learning has shown remarkable accuracy, yet clinical adoption remains limited due to the "black box" nature of these models. We present MelanomaNet, an explainable deep learning system for multi-class skin lesion classification that addresses this gap through four complementary interpretability mechanisms. Our approach combines an EfficientNet V2 backbone with GradCAM++ attention visualization, automated ABCDE clinical criterion extraction, Fast Concept Activation Vectors (FastCAV) for concept-based explanations, and Monte Carlo Dropout uncertainty quantification. We evaluate our system on the ISIC 2019 dataset containing 25,331 dermoscopic images across 9 diagnostic categories. Our model achieves 85.61% accuracy with a weighted F1 score of 0.8564, while providing clinically meaningful explanations that align model attention with established dermatological assessment criteria. The uncertainty quantification module decomposes prediction confidence into epistemic and aleatoric components, enabling automatic flagging of unreliable predictions for clinical review. Our results demonstrate that high classification performance can be achieved alongside comprehensive interpretability, potentially facilitating greater trust and adoption in clinical dermatology workflows.

Abstract: This paper focuses on the key issue in autonomous driving: small target recognition in dynamic perception. Existing algorithms suffer from poor detection performance due to missing small target information, scale imbalance, and occlusion. We propose an improved YOLOv8n-SPTS model, which enhances the detection accuracy of small traffic targets through three key innovations: First, optimizing the feature extraction module. In the Backbone Bottleneck structure of YOLOv8n, 4 traditional convolution modules are replaced with Space-to-Depth Convolution (SPD-Conv) modules. This module retains fine-grained information through space-to-depth conversion, reduces information loss, and enhances the ability to capture features of low-resolution small targets. Second, enhancing feature fusion capability. The Spatial Pyramid Pooling - Fast Cross Stage Partial Connection (SPPFCSPC) module is introduced to replace the original SPPF module, integrating the multi-scale feature extraction from Spatial Pyramid Pooling (SPP) and the feature fusion mechanism of Cross Stage Partial Connection (CSP), thereby improving the model's contextual understanding of complex scenes and multi-scale feature expression ability. Third, designing a dedicated detection structure for small targets. A Triple-Stage Feature Pyramid (TSFP) structure is proposed, which adds a 160*160 small target detection head to the original detection heads to fully utilize high-resolution features in shallow layers; meanwhile, redundant large target detection heads are removed to balance computational efficiency. Comparative experiments on the VisDrone2019-DET dataset show that YOLOv8n-SPTS model ranks first in precision (61.9%), recall (48.3%), mAP@0.5 (52.6%), and mAP@0.5:0.95 (32.6%). Visualization results verify that the miss rate of small targets such as pedestrians and bicycles in occluded and dense scenes is significantly reduced.

Abstract: Recent advances in video generation have been remarkable, enabling models to produce visually compelling videos with synchronized audio. While existing video generation benchmarks provide comprehensive metrics for visual quality, they lack convincing evaluations for audio-video generation, especially for models aiming to generate synchronized audio-video outputs. To address this gap, we introduce VABench, a comprehensive and multi-dimensional benchmark framework designed to systematically evaluate the capabilities of synchronous audio-video generation. VABench encompasses three primary task types: text-to-audio-video (T2AV), image-to-audio-video (I2AV), and stereo audio-video generation. It further establishes two major evaluation modules covering 15 dimensions. These dimensions specifically assess pairwise similarities (text-video, text-audio, video-audio), audio-video synchronization, lip-speech consistency, and carefully curated audio and video question-answering (QA) pairs, among others. Furthermore, VABench covers seven major content categories: animals, human sounds, music, environmental sounds, synchronous physical sounds, complex scenes, and virtual worlds. We provide a systematic analysis and visualization of the evaluation results, aiming to establish a new standard for assessing video generation models with synchronous audio capabilities and to promote the comprehensive advancement of the field.

Abstract: Accurate polyp segmentation during colonoscopy is critical for the early detection of colorectal cancer and still remains challenging due to significant size, shape, and color variations, and the camouflaged nature of polyps. While lightweight baseline models such as U-Net, U-Net++, and PraNet offer advantages in terms of easy deployment and low computational cost, they struggle to deal with the above issues, leading to limited segmentation performance. In contrast, large-scale vision foundation models such as SAM, DINOv2, OneFormer, and Mask2Former have exhibited impressive generalization performance across natural image domains. However, their direct transfer to medical imaging tasks (e.g., colonoscopic polyp segmentation) is not straightforward, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale datasets and lack of domain-specific knowledge. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel distillation framework, Polyp-DiFoM, that transfers the rich representations of foundation models into lightweight segmentation baselines, allowing efficient and accurate deployment in clinical settings. In particular, we infuse semantic priors from the foundation models into canonical architectures such as U-Net and U-Net++ and further perform frequency domain encoding for enhanced distillation, corroborating their generalization capability. Extensive experiments are performed across five benchmark datasets, such as Kvasir-SEG, CVC-ClinicDB, ETIS, ColonDB, and CVC-300. Notably, Polyp-DiFoM consistently outperforms respective baseline models significantly, as well as the state-of-the-art model, with nearly 9 times reduced computation overhead.

Abstract: Learning from noisy labels remains a major challenge in medical image analysis, where annotation demands expert knowledge and substantial inter-observer variability often leads to inconsistent or erroneous labels. Despite extensive research on learning with noisy labels (LNL), the robustness of existing methods in medical imaging has not been systematically assessed. To address this gap, we introduce LNMBench, a comprehensive benchmark for Label Noise in Medical imaging. LNMBench encompasses \textbf{10} representative methods evaluated across 7 datasets, 6 imaging modalities, and 3 noise patterns, establishing a unified and reproducible framework for robustness evaluation under realistic conditions. Comprehensive experiments reveal that the performance of existing LNL methods degrades substantially under high and real-world noise, highlighting the persistent challenges of class imbalance and domain variability in medical data. Motivated by these findings, we further propose a simple yet effective improvement to enhance model robustness under such conditions. The LNMBench codebase is publicly released to facilitate standardized evaluation, promote reproducible research, and provide practical insights for developing noise-resilient algorithms in both research and real-world medical applications.The codebase is publicly available on https://github.com/myyy777/LNMBench.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Generating lifelike conversational avatars requires modeling not just isolated speakers, but the dynamic, reciprocal interaction of speaking and listening. However, modeling the listener is exceptionally challenging: direct audio-driven training fails, producing stiff, static listening motions. This failure stems from a fundamental imbalance: the speaker's motion is strongly driven by speech audio, while the listener's motion primarily follows an internal motion prior and is only loosely guided by external speech. This challenge has led most methods to focus on speak-only generation. The only prior attempt at joint generation relies on extra speaker's motion to produce the listener. This design is not end-to-end, thereby hindering the real-time applicability. To address this limitation, we present UniLS, the first end-to-end framework for generating unified speak-listen expressions, driven by only dual-track audio. Our method introduces a novel two-stage training paradigm. Stage 1 first learns the internal motion prior by training an audio-free autoregressive generator, capturing the spontaneous dynamics of natural facial motion. Stage 2 then introduces the dual-track audio, fine-tuning the generator to modulate the learned motion prior based on external speech cues. Extensive evaluations show UniLS achieves state-of-the-art speaking accuracy. More importantly, it delivers up to 44.1\% improvement in listening metrics, generating significantly more diverse and natural listening expressions. This effectively mitigates the stiffness problem and provides a practical, high-fidelity audio-driven solution for interactive digital humans.

Abstract: Modeling relightable and animatable human avatars from monocular video is a long-standing and challenging task. Recently, Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) methods have been employed to reconstruct the avatars. However, they often produce unsatisfactory photo-realistic results because of insufficient geometrical details related to body motion, such as clothing wrinkles. In this paper, we propose a 3DGS-based human avatar modeling framework, termed as Relightable and Dynamic Gaussian Avatar (RnD-Avatar), that presents accurate pose-variant deformation for high-fidelity geometrical details. To achieve this, we introduce dynamic skinning weights that define the human avatar's articulation based on pose while also learning additional deformations induced by body motion. We also introduce a novel regularization to capture fine geometric details under sparse visual cues. Furthermore, we present a new multi-view dataset with varied lighting conditions to evaluate relight. Our framework enables realistic rendering of novel poses and views while supporting photo-realistic lighting effects under arbitrary lighting conditions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis, novel pose rendering, and relighting.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved remarkable results in novel view synthesis, typically using sRGB images for supervision. However, little attention has been paid to the color space in which the network is learning the radiance field representation. Inspired by the BiIlluminant Dichromatic Reflection (BIDR) model, which suggests that a logarithmic transformation simplifies the separation of illumination and reflectance, we hypothesize that log RGB space enables NeRF to learn a more compact and effective representation of scene appearance. To test this, we captured approximately 30 videos using a GoPro camera, ensuring linear data recovery through inverse encoding. We trained NeRF models under various color space interpretations linear, sRGB, GPLog, and log RGB by converting each network output to a common color space before rendering and loss computation, enforcing representation learning in different color spaces. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that using a log RGB color space consistently improves rendering quality, exhibits greater robustness across scenes, and performs particularly well in low light conditions while using the same bit-depth input images. Further analysis across different network sizes and NeRF variants confirms the generalization and stability of the log space advantage.

Abstract: Despite recent advances, diffusion-based text-to-image models still struggle with accurate text rendering. Several studies have proposed fine-tuning or training-free refinement methods for accurate text rendering. However, the critical issue of text omission, where the desired text is partially or entirely missing, remains largely overlooked. In this work, we propose TextGuider, a novel training-free method that encourages accurate and complete text appearance by aligning textual content tokens and text regions in the image. Specifically, we analyze attention patterns in MM-DiT models, particularly for text-related tokens intended to be rendered in the image. Leveraging this observation, we apply latent guidance during the early stage of denoising steps based on two loss functions that we introduce. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in test-time text rendering, with significant gains in recall and strong results in OCR accuracy and CLIP score.

Abstract: The rapid development of multimodal large-language models (MLLMs) has significantly expanded the scope of visual language reasoning, enabling unified systems to interpret and describe complex visual content. However, applying these models to long-video understanding remains computationally intensive. Dense frame encoding generates excessive visual tokens, leading to high memory consumption, redundant computation, and limited scalability in real-world applications. This inefficiency highlights a key limitation of the traditional process-then-reason paradigm, which analyzes visual streams exhaustively before semantic reasoning. To address this challenge, we introduce Video-QTR (Query-Driven Temporal Reasoning), a lightweight framework that redefines video comprehension as a query-guided reasoning process. Instead of encoding every frame, Video-QTR dynamically allocates perceptual resources based on the semantic intent of the query, creating an adaptive feedback loop between reasoning and perception. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks: MSVD-QA, Activity Net-QA, Movie Chat, and Video MME demonstrate that Video-QTR achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing input frame consumption by up to 73%. These results confirm that query-driven temporal reasoning provides an efficient and scalable solution for video understanding.

Conclusion: 所提出的基于视觉语言模型的类增量学习框架有效解决了跨任务类混淆问题，通过任务特定适配器、跨任务表示校准和不确定性引导推理三个核心技术组件，显著提升了类增量学习性能。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning requires a learning system to continually learn knowledge of new classes and meanwhile try to preserve previously learned knowledge of old classes. As current state-of-the-art methods based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs) still suffer from the issue of differentiating classes across learning tasks. Here a novel VLM-based continual learning framework for image classification is proposed. In this framework, task-specific adapters are added to the pre-trained and frozen image encoder to learn new knowledge, and a novel cross-task representation calibration strategy based on a mixture of light-weight projectors is used to help better separate all learned classes in a unified feature space, alleviating class confusion across tasks. In addition, a novel inference strategy guided by prediction uncertainty is developed to more accurately select the most appropriate image feature for class prediction. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets under various settings demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to existing ones.

Abstract: The growing adoption of XR devices has fueled strong demand for high-quality stereo video, yet its production remains costly and artifact-prone. To address this challenge, we present StereoWorld, an end-to-end framework that repurposes a pretrained video generator for high-fidelity monocular-to-stereo video generation. Our framework jointly conditions the model on the monocular video input while explicitly supervising the generation with a geometry-aware regularization to ensure 3D structural fidelity. A spatio-temporal tiling scheme is further integrated to enable efficient, high-resolution synthesis. To enable large-scale training and evaluation, we curate a high-definition stereo video dataset containing over 11M frames aligned to natural human interpupillary distance (IPD). Extensive experiments demonstrate that StereoWorld substantially outperforms prior methods, generating stereo videos with superior visual fidelity and geometric consistency.

Abstract: Class-agnostic 3D instance segmentation tackles the challenging task of segmenting all object instances, including previously unseen ones, without semantic class reliance. Current methods struggle with generalization due to the scarce annotated 3D scene data or noisy 2D segmentations. While synthetic data generation offers a promising solution, existing 3D scene synthesis methods fail to simultaneously satisfy geometry diversity, context complexity, and layout reasonability, each essential for this task. To address these needs, we propose an Adapted 3D Scene Synthesis pipeline for class-agnostic 3D Instance SegmenTation, termed as ASSIST-3D, to synthesize proper data for model generalization enhancement. Specifically, ASSIST-3D features three key innovations, including 1) Heterogeneous Object Selection from extensive 3D CAD asset collections, incorporating randomness in object sampling to maximize geometric and contextual diversity; 2) Scene Layout Generation through LLM-guided spatial reasoning combined with depth-first search for reasonable object placements; and 3) Realistic Point Cloud Construction via multi-view RGB-D image rendering and fusion from the synthetic scenes, closely mimicking real-world sensor data acquisition. Experiments on ScanNetV2, ScanNet++, and S3DIS benchmarks demonstrate that models trained with ASSIST-3D-generated data significantly outperform existing methods. Further comparisons underscore the superiority of our purpose-built pipeline over existing 3D scene synthesis approaches.

Abstract: The adoption of AI-powered computer vision in industry is often constrained by the need to balance operational utility with worker privacy. Building on our previously proposed privacy-preserving framework, this paper presents its first comprehensive validation on real-world data collected directly by industrial partners in active production environments. We evaluate the framework across three representative use cases: woodworking production monitoring, human-aware AGV navigation, and multi-camera ergonomic risk assessment. The approach employs learned visual transformations that obscure sensitive or task-irrelevant information while retaining features essential for task performance. Through both quantitative evaluation of the privacy-utility trade-off and qualitative feedback from industrial partners, we assess the framework's effectiveness, deployment feasibility, and trust implications. Results demonstrate that task-specific obfuscation enables effective monitoring with reduced privacy risks, establishing the framework's readiness for real-world adoption and providing cross-domain recommendations for responsible, human-centric AI deployment in industry.

Abstract: Registration of multiview point clouds conventionally relies on extensive pairwise matching to build a pose graph for global synchronization, which is computationally expensive and inherently ill-posed without holistic geometric constraints. This paper proposes FUSER, the first feed-forward multiview registration transformer that jointly processes all scans in a unified, compact latent space to directly predict global poses without any pairwise estimation. To maintain tractability, FUSER encodes each scan into low-resolution superpoint features via a sparse 3D CNN that preserves absolute translation cues, and performs efficient intra- and inter-scan reasoning through a Geometric Alternating Attention module. Particularly, we transfer 2D attention priors from off-the-shelf foundation models to enhance 3D feature interaction and geometric consistency. Building upon FUSER, we further introduce FUSER-DF, an SE(3)$^N$ diffusion refinement framework to correct FUSER's estimates via denoising in the joint SE(3)$^N$ space. FUSER acts as a surrogate multiview registration model to construct the denoiser, and a prior-conditioned SE(3)$^N$ variational lower bound is derived for denoising supervision. Extensive experiments on 3DMatch, ScanNet and ArkitScenes demonstrate that our approach achieves the superior registration accuracy and outstanding computational efficiency.

Motivation: 尽管基于扩散的生成模型在视觉保真度方面取得了显著进展，但对于特定感知属性（如颜色和形状）的内部表示机制仍缺乏深入理解。本研究旨在探索颜色在生成模型中的编码方式。

Method: 通过受控合成数据集、主成分分析（PCA）和相似性度量，系统分析Stable Diffusion的潜在表示。

Result: 研究发现颜色信息沿着圆形对抗轴编码，主要分布在潜在通道c_3和c_4中，而强度和形状信息主要表示在c_1和c_2通道中。Stable Diffusion的潜在空间显示出与高效编码表示一致的可解释结构。

Conclusion: 这些发现为未来模型理解、编辑应用以及设计更加解纠缠的生成框架提供了基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion-based generative models have achieved remarkable visual fidelity, yet a detailed understanding of how specific perceptual attributes - such as color and shape - are internally represented remains limited. This work explores how color is encoded in a generative model through a systematic analysis of the latent representations in Stable Diffusion. Through controlled synthetic datasets, principal component analysis (PCA) and similarity metrics, we reveal that color information is encoded along circular, opponent axes predominantly captured in latent channels c_3 and c_4, whereas intensity and shape are primarily represented in channels c_1 and c_2. Our findings indicate that the latent space of Stable Diffusion exhibits an interpretable structure aligned with a efficient coding representation. These insights provide a foundation for future work in model understanding, editing applications, and the design of more disentangled generative frameworks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: White balance (WB) is a key step in the image signal processor (ISP) pipeline that mitigates color casts caused by varying illumination and restores the scene's true colors. Currently, sRGB-based WB editing for post-ISP WB correction is widely used to address color constancy failures in the ISP pipeline when the original camera RAW is unavailable. However, additive color models (e.g., sRGB) are inherently limited by fixed nonlinear transformations and entangled color channels, which often impede their generalization to complex lighting conditions.
  To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework for WB correction that leverages a perception-inspired Learnable HSI (LHSI) color space. Built upon a cylindrical color model that naturally separates luminance from chromatic components, our framework further introduces dedicated parameters to enhance this disentanglement and learnable mapping to adaptively refine the flexibility. Moreover, a new Mamba-based network is introduced, which is tailored to the characteristics of the proposed LHSI color space.
  Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method, highlighting the potential of perception-inspired color space design in computational photography. The source code is available at https://github.com/YangCheng58/WB_Color_Space.

Motivation: CNN主要关注局部模式，在理解图像的全局上下文方面存在局限；而ViT通过自注意力机制能够捕捉整个图像的关系。研究旨在比较各类ViT与CNN在不同任务上的表现。

Method: 在不同ViT架构（纯、分层、混合）和CNN模型上进行了系统对比实验，包括物体识别、检测和医学图像分类任务。使用ImageNet、COCO和ChestX-ray14数据集，并在医学图像上测试了数据增强技术。

Result: 混合和分层Transformer（特别是Swin和CvT）在准确性和计算资源间取得了良好平衡。数据增强技术在医学图像上显著提升了性能，尤其是Swin Transformer。ViT在许多情况下表现优于传统CNN，特别是在需要全局视觉理解的场景中。

Conclusion: Vision Transformers具有竞争力，在许多任务上超越传统CNN，尤其在需要全局上下文理解的医学影像等应用中表现突出，为计算机视觉任务提供了有效的替代方案。

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for computer vision sometimes struggle with understanding images in a global context, as they mainly focus on local patterns. On the other hand, Vision Transformers (ViTs), inspired by models originally created for language processing, use self-attention mechanisms, which allow them to understand relationships across the entire image. In this paper, we compare different types of ViTs (pure, hierarchical, and hybrid) against traditional CNN models across various tasks, including object recognition, detection, and medical image classification. We conduct thorough tests on standard datasets like ImageNet for image classification and COCO for object detection. Additionally, we apply these models to medical imaging using the ChestX-ray14 dataset. We find that hybrid and hierarchical transformers, especially Swin and CvT, offer a strong balance between accuracy and computational resources. Furthermore, by experimenting with data augmentation techniques on medical images, we discover significant performance improvements, particularly with the Swin Transformer model. Overall, our results indicate that Vision Transformers are competitive and, in many cases, outperform traditional CNNs, especially in scenarios requiring the understanding of global visual contexts like medical imaging.

Conclusion: 所提出的WAH框架通过双曲线语义建模和Wasserstein流形对齐机制，有效提高了多视图聚类的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multi-view clustering (MVC) aims to uncover the latent structure of multi-view data by learning view-common and view-specific information. Although recent studies have explored hyperbolic representations for better tackling the representation gap between different views, they focus primarily on instance-level alignment and neglect global semantic consistency, rendering them vulnerable to view-specific information (\textit{e.g.}, noise and cross-view discrepancies). To this end, this paper proposes a novel Wasserstein-Aligned Hyperbolic (WAH) framework for multi-view clustering. Specifically, our method exploits a view-specific hyperbolic encoder for each view to embed features into the Lorentz manifold for hierarchical semantic modeling. Whereafter, a global semantic loss based on the hyperbolic sliced-Wasserstein distance is introduced to align manifold distributions across views. This is followed by soft cluster assignments to encourage cross-view semantic consistency. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarking datasets show that our method can achieve SOTA clustering performance.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel 3D registration paradigm, Generative Point Cloud Registration, which bridges advanced 2D generative models with 3D matching tasks to enhance registration performance. Our key idea is to generate cross-view consistent image pairs that are well-aligned with the source and target point clouds, enabling geometry-color feature fusion to facilitate robust matching. To ensure high-quality matching, the generated image pair should feature both 2D-3D geometric consistency and cross-view texture consistency. To achieve this, we introduce Match-ControlNet, a matching-specific, controllable 2D generative model. Specifically, it leverages the depth-conditioned generation capability of ControlNet to produce images that are geometrically aligned with depth maps derived from point clouds, ensuring 2D-3D geometric consistency. Additionally, by incorporating a coupled conditional denoising scheme and coupled prompt guidance, Match-ControlNet further promotes cross-view feature interaction, guiding texture consistency generation. Our generative 3D registration paradigm is general and could be seamlessly integrated into various registration methods to enhance their performance. Extensive experiments on 3DMatch and ScanNet datasets verify the effectiveness of our approach.

Abstract: Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has been highly successful in solving complex tasks in natural language processing, and recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have extended this paradigm to video reasoning. However, these models typically build on lengthy reasoning chains and large numbers of input visual tokens. Motivated by empirical observations from our benchmark study, we hypothesize that concise reasoning combined with a reduced set of visual tokens can be sufficient for effective video reasoning. To evaluate this hypothesis, we design and validate an efficient post-training and inference framework that enhances a video MLLM's reasoning capability. Our framework enables models to operate on compressed visual tokens and generate brief reasoning traces prior to answering. The resulting models achieve substantially improved inference efficiency, deliver competitive performance across diverse benchmarks, and avoid reliance on manual CoT annotations or supervised fine-tuning. Collectively, our results suggest that long, human-like CoT reasoning may not be necessary for general video reasoning, and that concise reasoning can be both effective and efficient. Our code will be released at https://github.com/LaVi-Lab/Rethink_CoT_Video.

Motivation: 现有视频头部交换方法因缺乏真实配对数据，通常需要在同一视频内使用跨帧对进行训练，依赖基于掩码的修复技术，这可能导致边界伪影且难以恢复被遮挡的面部姿态、表情和运动动态等重要线索。

Conclusion: 通过构建首个跨身份配对数据集HeadSwapBench和提出的DirectSwap框架，该研究解决了视频头部交换中的关键挑战，为未来研究提供了有价值的数据集和方法基础，并将开源代码和数据集以促进该领域发展。

Abstract: Video head swapping aims to replace the entire head of a video subject, including facial identity, head shape, and hairstyle, with that of a reference image, while preserving the target body, background, and motion dynamics. Due to the lack of ground-truth paired swapping data, prior methods typically train on cross-frame pairs of the same person within a video and rely on mask-based inpainting to mitigate identity leakage. Beyond potential boundary artifacts, this paradigm struggles to recover essential cues occluded by the mask, such as facial pose, expressions, and motion dynamics. To address these issues, we prompt a video editing model to synthesize new heads for existing videos as fake swapping inputs, while maintaining frame-synchronized facial poses and expressions. This yields HeadSwapBench, the first cross-identity paired dataset for video head swapping, which supports both training (\TrainNum{} videos) and benchmarking (\TestNum{} videos) with genuine outputs. Leveraging this paired supervision, we propose DirectSwap, a mask-free, direct video head-swapping framework that extends an image U-Net into a video diffusion model with a motion module and conditioning inputs. Furthermore, we introduce the Motion- and Expression-Aware Reconstruction (MEAR) loss, which reweights the diffusion loss per pixel using frame-difference magnitudes and facial-landmark proximity, thereby enhancing cross-frame coherence in motion and expressions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DirectSwap achieves state-of-the-art visual quality, identity fidelity, and motion and expression consistency across diverse in-the-wild video scenes. We will release the source code and the HeadSwapBench dataset to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Ultrasound echocardiography is essential for the non-invasive, real-time assessment of cardiac function, but the scarcity of labelled data, driven by privacy restrictions and the complexity of expert annotation, remains a major obstacle for deep learning methods. We propose the Motion Conditioned Diffusion Model (MCDM), a label-free latent diffusion framework that synthesises realistic echocardiography videos conditioned on self-supervised motion features. To extract these features, we design the Motion and Appearance Feature Extractor (MAFE), which disentangles motion and appearance representations from videos. Feature learning is further enhanced by two auxiliary objectives: a re-identification loss guided by pseudo appearance features and an optical flow loss guided by pseudo flow fields. Evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, MCDM achieves competitive video generation performance, producing temporally coherent and clinically realistic sequences without reliance on manual labels. These results demonstrate the potential of self-supervised conditioning for scalable echocardiography synthesis. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZheLi2020/LabelfreeMCDM.

Abstract: Echocardiography playing a critical role in the diagnosis and monitoring of cardiovascular diseases as a non-invasive real-time assessment of cardiac structure and function. However, the growing scale of echocardiographic video data presents significant challenges in terms of storage, computation, and model training efficiency. Dataset distillation offers a promising solution by synthesizing a compact, informative subset of data that retains the key clinical features of the original dataset. In this work, we propose a novel approach for distilling a compact synthetic echocardiographic video dataset. Our method leverages motion feature extraction to capture temporal dynamics, followed by class-wise graph construction and representative sample selection using the Infomap algorithm. This enables us to select a diverse and informative subset of synthetic videos that preserves the essential characteristics of the original dataset. We evaluate our approach on the EchoNet-Dynamic datasets and achieve a test accuracy of \(69.38\%\) using only \(25\) synthetic videos. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our method for medical video dataset distillation.

Abstract: Learning natural body motion remains challenging due to the strong coupling between spatial geometry and temporal dynamics. Embedding motion in phase manifolds, latent spaces that capture local periodicity, has proven effective for motion prediction; however, existing approaches lack scalability and remain confined to specific settings. We introduce FunPhase, a functional periodic autoencoder that learns a phase manifold for motion and replaces discrete temporal decoding with a function-space formulation, enabling smooth trajectories that can be sampled at arbitrary temporal resolutions. FunPhase supports downstream tasks such as super-resolution and partial-body motion completion, generalizes across skeletons and datasets, and unifies motion prediction and generation within a single interpretable manifold. Our model achieves substantially lower reconstruction error than prior periodic autoencoder baselines while enabling a broader range of applications and performing on par with state-of-the-art motion generation methods.

Motivation: 现有方法在部件级3D生成中存在局限性：要么依赖隐式部件分割且粒度控制有限，要么需要大量标注数据训练的外部分割器。作者观察到部件感知会在整体几何学习中自然浮现，因此开发能联合编码物体几何和部件结构的统一表示。

Conclusion: Geom-Seg VecSet能有效捕捉几何与部件结构的内在关联，UniPart框架为部件级3D生成提供了新的解决方案，实现了更好的分割可控性和生成质量。

Abstract: Part-level 3D generation is essential for applications requiring decomposable and structured 3D synthesis. However, existing methods either rely on implicit part segmentation with limited granularity control or depend on strong external segmenters trained on large annotated datasets. In this work, we observe that part awareness emerges naturally during whole-object geometry learning and propose Geom-Seg VecSet, a unified geometry-segmentation latent representation that jointly encodes object geometry and part-level structure. Building on this representation, we introduce UniPart, a two-stage latent diffusion framework for image-guided part-level 3D generation. The first stage performs joint geometry generation and latent part segmentation, while the second stage conditions part-level diffusion on both whole-object and part-specific latents. A dual-space generation scheme further enhances geometric fidelity by predicting part latents in both global and canonical spaces. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniPart achieves superior segmentation controllability and part-level geometric quality compared with existing approaches.

Abstract: Visual concept composition, which aims to integrate different elements from images and videos into a single, coherent visual output, still falls short in accurately extracting complex concepts from visual inputs and flexibly combining concepts from both images and videos. We introduce Bind & Compose, a one-shot method that enables flexible visual concept composition by binding visual concepts with corresponding prompt tokens and composing the target prompt with bound tokens from various sources. It adopts a hierarchical binder structure for cross-attention conditioning in Diffusion Transformers to encode visual concepts into corresponding prompt tokens for accurate decomposition of complex visual concepts. To improve concept-token binding accuracy, we design a Diversify-and-Absorb Mechanism that uses an extra absorbent token to eliminate the impact of concept-irrelevant details when training with diversified prompts. To enhance the compatibility between image and video concepts, we present a Temporal Disentanglement Strategy that decouples the training process of video concepts into two stages with a dual-branch binder structure for temporal modeling. Evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves superior concept consistency, prompt fidelity, and motion quality over existing approaches, opening up new possibilities for visual creativity.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了DAPO方法，通过逐步调优生成缺陷感知提示，实现了零样本多类型和二元异常检测与分割在分布偏移下的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在异常检测中主要关注高级语义信息，但忽略了细粒度异常类型（如孔洞、切口、划痕），而这些信息能提供更具体的异常性质洞察，帮助制造商理解异常根本原因并实施更有针对性的纠正措施。手工设计每个缺陷类型的提示既耗时又易受人为主观影响。

Method: DAPO是一种基于逐步调优的缺陷感知提示优化方法，通过将异常相关图像特征与对应文本语义对齐，结合固定文本锚点和可学习标记嵌入来学习混合缺陷感知提示。

Result: 在公开基准（MPDD、VisA、MVTec-AD、MAD、Real-IAD）和内部数据集上的实验表明，相比基线模型，DAPO在分布偏移下的图像级AUROC和平均精度指标平均提升3.7%，在零样本设置下针对新异常类型定位平均提升6.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法通过融合细粒度异常类型语义，显著提高了异常检测的准确性和可解释性，为实际工业场景中快速识别异常根本原因提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent vision language models (VLMs) like CLIP have demonstrated impressive anomaly detection performance under significant distribution shift by utilizing high-level semantic information through text prompts. However, these models often neglect fine-grained details, such as which kind of anomalies, like "hole", "cut", "scratch" that could provide more specific insight into the nature of anomalies. We argue that recognizing fine-grained anomaly types 1) enriches the representation of "abnormal" with structured semantics, narrowing the gap between coarse anomaly signals and fine-grained defect categories; 2) enables manufacturers to understand the root causes of the anomaly and implement more targeted and appropriate corrective measures quickly. While incorporating such detailed semantic information is crucial, designing handcrafted prompts for each defect type is both time-consuming and susceptible to human bias. For this reason, we introduce DAPO, a novel approach for Defect-aware Prompt Optimization based on progressive tuning for the zero-shot multi-type and binary anomaly detection and segmentation under distribution shifts. Our approach aligns anomaly-relevant image features with their corresponding text semantics by learning hybrid defect-aware prompts with both fixed textual anchors and learnable token embeddings. We conducted experiments on public benchmarks (MPDD, VisA, MVTec-AD, MAD, and Real-IAD) and an internal dataset. The results suggest that compared to the baseline models, DAPO achieves a 3.7% average improvement in AUROC and average precision metrics at the image level under distribution shift, and a 6.5% average improvement in localizing novel anomaly types under zero-shot settings.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedForget是一个面向医疗AI多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)的层次感知遗忘测试基准，支持在医疗数据层级结构下系统评估数据遗忘方法的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在医疗AI系统中广泛应用，但基于敏感患者数据的训练面临着HIPAA和GDPR等法规要求的'被遗忘权'挑战。现有遗忘方法在复杂的医疗场景中的有效性尚未得到充分研究，需要系统性的评估工具。

Method: 构建了包含3840个多模态实例(图像、问题、答案)的测试基准，将医院数据建模为嵌套层次结构(机构→患者→研究→部门)，建立显式的保留/遗忘分割，并为每个层次级别提供专用的遗忘目标。测试了四种最先进的遗忘方法在三类任务(生成、分类、填空)上的表现，并引入了重建攻击来验证遗忘的彻底性。

Result: 现有遗忘方法在实现完全的、层次感知的遗忘方面存在困难，同时要保持诊断性能不变具有挑战性。粗粒度遗忘对重建攻击表现出较强抵抗力，而细粒度遗忘后的模型更容易被重建攻击恢复遗忘信息。

Conclusion: MedForget提供了一个符合HIPAA标准的实用测试平台，用于构建合规的医疗AI系统，揭示了医疗场景中多层次数据遗忘的复杂性，并指出了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Pretrained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly deployed in medical AI systems for clinical reasoning, diagnosis support, and report generation. However, their training on sensitive patient data raises critical privacy and compliance challenges under regulations such as HIPAA and GDPR, which enforce the "right to be forgotten". Unlearning, the process of tuning models to selectively remove the influence of specific training data points, offers a potential solution, yet its effectiveness in complex medical settings remains underexplored. To systematically study this, we introduce MedForget, a Hierarchy-Aware Multimodal Unlearning Testbed with explicit retain and forget splits and evaluation sets containing rephrased variants. MedForget models hospital data as a nested hierarchy (Institution -> Patient -> Study -> Section), enabling fine-grained assessment across eight organizational levels. The benchmark contains 3840 multimodal (image, question, answer) instances, each hierarchy level having a dedicated unlearning target, reflecting distinct unlearning challenges. Experiments with four SOTA unlearning methods on three tasks (generation, classification, cloze) show that existing methods struggle to achieve complete, hierarchy-aware forgetting without reducing diagnostic performance. To test whether unlearning truly deletes hierarchical pathways, we introduce a reconstruction attack that progressively adds hierarchical level context to prompts. Models unlearned at a coarse granularity show strong resistance, while fine-grained unlearning leaves models vulnerable to such reconstruction. MedForget provides a practical, HIPAA-aligned testbed for building compliant medical AI systems.

Method: 提出了MODA数据集和OSSDet框架：采用级联光谱-空间调制结构优化目标感知；通过光谱相似性聚合光谱相关特征增强目标内部相关性；使用目标感知掩码抑制无关背景；在目标感知指导下使用跨光谱注意力精炼目标表示。

Conclusion: MODA数据集填补了多光谱航空目标检测领域的数据空白，OSSDet框架有效整合光谱、空间和目标感知信息，在多光谱航空目标检测任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Aerial object detection faces significant challenges in real-world scenarios, such as small objects and extensive background interference, which limit the performance of RGB-based detectors with insufficient discriminative information. Multispectral images (MSIs) capture additional spectral cues across multiple bands, offering a promising alternative. However, the lack of training data has been the primary bottleneck to exploiting the potential of MSIs. To address this gap, we introduce the first large-scale dataset for Multispectral Object Detection in Aerial images (MODA), which comprises 14,041 MSIs and 330,191 annotations across diverse, challenging scenarios, providing a comprehensive data foundation for this field. Furthermore, to overcome challenges inherent to aerial object detection using MSIs, we propose OSSDet, a framework that integrates spectral and spatial information with object-aware cues. OSSDet employs a cascaded spectral-spatial modulation structure to optimize target perception, aggregates spectrally related features by exploiting spectral similarities to reinforce intra-object correlations, and suppresses irrelevant background via object-aware masking. Moreover, cross-spectral attention further refines object-related representations under explicit object-aware guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OSSDet outperforms existing methods with comparable parameters and efficiency.

Motivation: 现有的自监督学习方法大多基于CNN或视觉Transformer，但CNN难以捕捉沿叶片结构连续演变的病害模式，而Transformer在处理高分辨率图像块时存在二次注意力成本问题。需要一种更适合农业图像的自监督学习方法。

Method: 使用Vision Mamba状态空间编码器，通过方向扫描叶片表面来建模长距离病变连续性，采用原型驱动的师生目标对齐多视图表示，从标记数据中鼓励稳定且病变感知的特征学习。

Conclusion: 线性状态空间建模为自监督植物病害表示学习提供了优势，StateSpace-SSL框架能有效捕捉农业图像中的病变连续性特征，是植物病害检测的有前景的方法。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is attractive for plant disease detection as it can exploit large collections of unlabeled leaf images, yet most existing SSL methods are built on CNNs or vision transformers that are poorly matched to agricultural imagery. CNN-based SSL struggles to capture disease patterns that evolve continuously along leaf structures, while transformer-based SSL introduces quadratic attention cost from high-resolution patches. To address these limitations, we propose StateSpace-SSL, a linear-time SSL framework that employs a Vision Mamba state-space encoder to model long-range lesion continuity through directional scanning across the leaf surface. A prototype-driven teacher-student objective aligns representations across multiple views, encouraging stable and lesion-aware features from labelled data. Experiments on three publicly available plant disease datasets show that StateSpace-SSL consistently outperforms the CNN- and transformer-based SSL baselines in various evaluation metrics. Qualitative analyses further confirm that it learns compact, lesion-focused feature maps, highlighting the advantage of linear state-space modelling for self-supervised plant disease representation learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于视觉语言模型的盲图像质量评估方法虽然具有语义推理能力，但在推理过程中经常产生矛盾的文本描述和预测不稳定的问题，这与人类推理过程不符。因此需要理解这些问题的根源并改进推理过程。

Method: 通过分析发现，预测结果与视觉特征之间缺乏充分依据和逻辑联系。提出两阶段调优方法：第一阶段学习视觉特征，第二阶段仅基于这些特征进行质量推理，以实现更接近人类推理的过程。

Result: 在SPAQ和KONIQ数据集上，我们的方法将预测不稳定性从22.00%降至12.39%，在LIVE、CSIQ、SPAQ和KONIQ等数据集上的SRCC/PLCC平均提升了0.3124/0.3507，同时提高了推理过程的稳定性。

Conclusion: 通过将视觉感知与质量推理进行分离的两阶段调优方法，可以有效解决VLM在盲图像质量评估中的预测不稳定问题，实现更可靠、更符合人类认知的推理过程。

Abstract: Recent progress in BIQA has been driven by VLMs, whose semantic reasoning abilities suggest that they might extract visual features, generate descriptive text, and infer quality in a human-like manner. However, these models often produce textual descriptions that contradict their final quality predictions, and the predicted scores can change unstably during inference - behaviors not aligned with human reasoning. To understand these issues, we analyze the factors that cause contradictory assessments and instability. We first estimate the relationship between the final quality predictions and the generated visual features, finding that the predictions are not fully grounded in the features and that the logical connection between them is weak. Moreover, decoding intermediate VLM layers shows that the model frequently relies on a limited set of candidate tokens, which contributes to prediction instability. To encourage more human-like reasoning, we introduce a two-stage tuning method that explicitly separates visual perception from quality inference. In the first stage, the model learns visual features; in the second, it infers quality solely from these features. Experiments on SPAQ and KONIQ demonstrate that our approach reduces prediction instability from 22.00% to 12.39% and achieves average gains of 0.3124/0.3507 in SRCC/PLCC across LIVE, CSIQ, SPAQ, and KONIQ compared to the baseline. Further analyses show that our method improves both stability and the reliability of the inference process.

Abstract: Recent advances in Image Quality Assessment (IQA) have leveraged Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to generate descriptive explanations. However, despite their strong visual perception modules, these models often fail to reliably detect basic low-level distortions such as blur, noise, and compression, and may produce inconsistent evaluations across repeated inferences. This raises an essential question: do MLLM-based IQA systems truly perceive the visual features that matter? To examine this issue, we introduce a low-level distortion perception task that requires models to classify specific distortion types. Our component-wise analysis shows that although MLLMs are structurally capable of representing such distortions, they tend to overfit training templates, leading to biases in quality scoring. As a result, critical low-level features are weakened or lost during the vision-language alignment transfer stage. Furthermore, by computing the semantic distance between visual features and corresponding semantic tokens before and after component-wise fine-tuning, we show that improving the alignment of the vision encoder dramatically enhances distortion recognition accuracy, increasing it from 14.92% to 84.43%. Overall, these findings indicate that incorporating dedicated constraints on the vision encoder can strengthen text-explainable visual representations and enable MLLM-based pipelines to produce more coherent and interpretable reasoning in vision-centric tasks.

Abstract: Environmental variables are increasingly affecting agricultural decision-making, yet accessible and scalable tools for soil assessment remain limited. This study presents a robust and scalable modeling system for estimating soil properties in croplands, including soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (N), available phosphorus (P), exchangeable potassium (K), and pH, using remote sensing data and environmental covariates. The system employs a hybrid modeling approach, combining the indirect methods of modeling soil through proxies and drivers with direct spectral modeling. We extend current approaches by using interpretable physics-informed covariates derived from radiative transfer models (RTMs) and complex, nonlinear embeddings from a foundation model. We validate the system on a harmonized dataset that covers Europes cropland soils across diverse pedoclimatic zones. Evaluation is conducted under a robust validation framework that enforces strict spatial blocking, stratified splits, and statistically distinct train-test sets, which deliberately make the evaluation harder and produce more realistic error estimates for unseen regions. The models achieved their highest accuracy for SOC and N. This performance held across unseen locations, under both spatial cross-validation and an independent test set. SOC obtained a MAE of 5.12 g/kg and a CCC of 0.77, and N obtained a MAE of 0.44 g/kg and a CCC of 0.77. We also assess uncertainty through conformal calibration, achieving 90 percent coverage at the target confidence level. This study contributes to the digital advancement of agriculture through the application of scalable, data-driven soil analysis frameworks that can be extended to related domains requiring quantitative soil evaluation, such as carbon markets.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Image retouching has received significant attention due to its ability to achieve high-quality visual content. Existing approaches mainly rely on uniform pixel-wise color mapping across entire images, neglecting the inherent color variations induced by image content. This limitation hinders existing approaches from achieving adaptive retouching that accommodates both diverse color distributions and user-defined style preferences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Content-Adaptive image retouching method guided by Attribute-based Text Representation (CA-ATP). Specifically, we propose a content-adaptive curve mapping module, which leverages a series of basis curves to establish multiple color mapping relationships and learns the corresponding weight maps, enabling content-aware color adjustments. The proposed module can capture color diversity within the image content, allowing similar color values to receive distinct transformations based on their spatial context. In addition, we propose an attribute text prediction module that generates text representations from multiple image attributes, which explicitly represent user-defined style preferences. These attribute-based text representations are subsequently integrated with visual features via a multimodal model, providing user-friendly guidance for image retouching. Extensive experiments on several public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: We address the problem of fair classification in settings where data is scarce and unbalanced across demographic groups. Such low-data regimes are common in domains like medical imaging, where false negatives can have fatal consequences.
  We propose a novel approach \emph{OxEnsemble} for efficiently training ensembles and enforcing fairness in these low-data regimes. Unlike other approaches, we aggregate predictions across ensemble members, each trained to satisfy fairness constraints. By construction, \emph{OxEnsemble} is both data-efficient, carefully reusing held-out data to enforce fairness reliably, and compute-efficient, requiring little more compute than used to fine-tune or evaluate an existing model. We validate this approach with new theoretical guarantees. Experimentally, our approach yields more consistent outcomes and stronger fairness-accuracy trade-offs than existing methods across multiple challenging medical imaging classification datasets.

Conclusion: UnReflectAnything通过RGB-only方法有效消除高光，提升了图像质量并支持几何推理，尤其在非朗伯表面和非均匀光照条件下表现优异。

Abstract: Specular highlights distort appearance, obscure texture, and hinder geometric reasoning in both natural and surgical imagery. We present UnReflectAnything, an RGB-only framework that removes highlights from a single image by predicting a highlight map together with a reflection-free diffuse reconstruction. The model uses a frozen vision transformer encoder to extract multi-scale features, a lightweight head to localize specular regions, and a token-level inpainting module that restores corrupted feature patches before producing the final diffuse image. To overcome the lack of paired supervision, we introduce a Virtual Highlight Synthesis pipeline that renders physically plausible specularities using monocular geometry, Fresnel-aware shading, and randomized lighting which enables training on arbitrary RGB images with correct geometric structure. UnReflectAnything generalizes across natural and surgical domains where non-Lambertian surfaces and non-uniform lighting create severe highlights and it achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks.

Abstract: Responsive and accurate facial expression recognition is crucial to human-robot interaction for daily service robots. Nowadays, event cameras are becoming more widely adopted as they surpass RGB cameras in capturing facial expression changes due to their high temporal resolution, low latency, computational efficiency, and robustness in low-light conditions. Despite these advantages, event-based approaches still encounter practical challenges, particularly in adopting mainstream deep learning models. Traditional deep learning methods for facial expression analysis are energy-intensive, making them difficult to deploy on edge computing devices and thereby increasing costs, especially for high-frequency, dynamic, event vision-based approaches. To address this challenging issue, we proposed the CS3D framework by decomposing the Convolutional 3D method to reduce the computational complexity and energy consumption. Additionally, by utilizing soft spiking neurons and a spatial-temporal attention mechanism, the ability to retain information is enhanced, thus improving the accuracy of facial expression detection. Experimental results indicate that our proposed CS3D method attains higher accuracy on multiple datasets compared to architectures such as the RNN, Transformer, and C3D, while the energy consumption of the CS3D method is just 21.97\% of the original C3D required on the same device.

Abstract: Multiview diffusion models have rapidly emerged as a powerful tool for content creation with spatial consistency across viewpoints, offering rich visual realism without requiring explicit geometry and appearance representation. However, compared to meshes or radiance fields, existing multiview diffusion models offer limited appearance manipulation, particularly in terms of material, texture, or style.
  In this paper, we present a lightweight adaptation technique for appearance transfer in multiview diffusion models. Our method learns to combine object identity from an input image with appearance cues rendered in a separate reference image, producing multi-view-consistent output that reflects the desired materials, textures, or styles. This allows explicit specification of appearance parameters at generation time while preserving the underlying object geometry and view coherence. We leverage three diffusion denoising processes responsible for generating the original object, the reference, and the target images, and perform reverse sampling to aggregate a small subset of layer-wise self-attention features from the object and the reference to influence the target generation. Our method requires only a few training examples to introduce appearance awareness to pretrained multiview models. The experiments show that our method provides a simple yet effective way toward multiview generation with diverse appearance, advocating the adoption of implicit generative 3D representations in practice.

Abstract: Reliably predicting human intent in hand-object interactions is an open challenge for computer vision. Our research concentrates on a fundamental sub-problem: the fine-grained classification of atomic interaction states, namely 'approaching', 'grabbing', and 'holding'. To this end, we introduce a structured data engineering process that converts raw videos from the MANIAC dataset into 27,476 statistical-kinematic feature vectors. Each vector encapsulates relational and dynamic properties from a short temporal window of motion. Our initial hypothesis posited that sequential modeling would be critical, leading us to compare static classifiers (MLPs) against temporal models (RNNs). Counter-intuitively, the key discovery occurred when we set the sequence length of a Bidirectional RNN to one (seq_length=1). This modification converted the network's function, compelling it to act as a high-capacity static feature encoder. This architectural change directly led to a significant accuracy improvement, culminating in a final score of 97.60%. Of particular note, our optimized model successfully overcame the most challenging transitional class, 'grabbing', by achieving a balanced F1-score of 0.90. These findings provide a new benchmark for low-level hand-object interaction recognition using structured, interpretable features and lightweight architectures.

Abstract: Several object tracking pipelines extending Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) have been proposed in the past year, where the approach is to follow and segment the object from a single exemplar template provided by the user on a initialization frame. We propose to benchmark these high performing trackers (SAM2, EfficientTAM, DAM4SAM and SAMURAI) on datasets containing fast moving objects (FMO) specifically designed to be challenging for tracking approaches. The goal is to understand better current limitations in state-of-the-art trackers by providing more detailed insights on the behavior of these trackers. We show that overall the trackers DAM4SAM and SAMURAI perform well on more challenging sequences.

Abstract: Developing generalizable AI for medical imaging requires both access to large, multi-center datasets and standardized, reproducible tooling within research environments. However, leveraging real-world imaging data in clinical research environments is still hampered by strict regulatory constraints, fragmented software infrastructure, and the challenges inherent in conducting large-cohort multicentre studies. This leads to projects that rely on ad-hoc toolchains that are hard to reproduce, difficult to scale beyond single institutions and poorly suited for collaboration between clinicians and data scientists. We present Kaapana, a comprehensive open-source platform for medical imaging research that is designed to bridge this gap. Rather than building single-use, site-specific tooling, Kaapana provides a modular, extensible framework that unifies data ingestion, cohort curation, processing workflows and result inspection under a common user interface. By bringing the algorithm to the data, it enables institutions to keep control over their sensitive data while still participating in distributed experimentation and model development. By integrating flexible workflow orchestration with user-facing applications for researchers, Kaapana reduces technical overhead, improves reproducibility and enables conducting large-scale, collaborative, multi-centre imaging studies. We describe the core concepts of the platform and illustrate how they can support diverse use cases, from local prototyping to nation-wide research networks.

TL;DR: VHOI提出了一个两阶段框架，通过将稀疏轨迹稠化为HOI掩码序列，并基于这些稠密掩码微调视频扩散模型，实现了可控的人类-物体交互视频生成，在HOI视频生成方面达到了先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成真实的人类-物体交互（HOI）视频具有挑战性，因为人类和物体都具有复杂、特定于实例的交互动态。现有可控视频生成方法存在权衡：稀疏控制（如关键点轨迹）易于指定但缺乏实例感知，而密集信号（如光流、深度或3D网格）信息丰富但获取成本高。

Method: VHOI采用两阶段框架：1) 将稀疏轨迹稠化为HOI掩码序列；2) 基于这些稠密掩码微调视频扩散模型。引入新颖的HOI感知运动表示，使用颜色编码区分人类和物体运动以及身体部位特定的动态，将人类先验融入条件信号，增强模型理解和生成真实HOI动态的能力。

Result: 实验展示了在可控HOI视频生成方面的最先进结果。VHOI不仅限于仅交互场景，还能以端到端的方式生成导致物体交互的完整人类导航。

Conclusion: VHOI通过其两阶段框架和HOI感知运动表示，在可控人类-物体交互视频生成方面取得了显著进展，解决了现有方法在稀疏控制和密集信号之间的权衡问题，同时保持了生成质量和对复杂交互动态的建模能力。

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic human-object interactions (HOI) in video is challenging due to the complex, instance-specific interaction dynamics of both humans and objects. Incorporating controllability in video generation further adds to the complexity. Existing controllable video generation approaches face a trade-off: sparse controls like keypoint trajectories are easy to specify but lack instance-awareness, while dense signals such as optical flow, depths or 3D meshes are informative but costly to obtain. We propose VHOI, a two-stage framework that first densifies sparse trajectories into HOI mask sequences, and then fine-tunes a video diffusion model conditioned on these dense masks. We introduce a novel HOI-aware motion representation that uses color encodings to distinguish not only human and object motion, but also body-part-specific dynamics. This design incorporates a human prior into the conditioning signal and strengthens the model's ability to understand and generate realistic HOI dynamics. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results in controllable HOI video generation. VHOI is not limited to interaction-only scenarios and can also generate full human navigation leading up to object interactions in an end-to-end manner.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to impressive progress across various benchmarks. However, their capability in understanding infrared images remains unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce IF-Bench, the first high-quality benchmark designed for evaluating multimodal understanding of infrared images. IF-Bench consists of 499 images sourced from 23 infrared datasets and 680 carefully curated visual question-answer pairs, covering 10 essential dimensions of image understanding. Based on this benchmark, we systematically evaluate over 40 open-source and closed-source MLLMs, employing cyclic evaluation, bilingual assessment, and hybrid judgment strategies to enhance the reliability of the results. Our analysis reveals how model scale, architecture, and inference paradigms affect infrared image comprehension, providing valuable insights for this area. Furthermore, we propose a training-free generative visual prompting (GenViP) method, which leverages advanced image editing models to translate infrared images into semantically and spatially aligned RGB counterparts, thereby mitigating domain distribution shifts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently yields significant performance improvements across a wide range of MLLMs. The benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/casiatao/IF-Bench.

Abstract: Recent advances in generative models have demonstrated an exceptional ability to produce highly realistic images. However, previous studies show that generated images often resemble the training data, and this problem becomes more severe as the model size increases. Memorizing training data can lead to legal challenges, including copyright infringement, violations of portrait rights, and trademark violations. Existing approaches to mitigating memorization mainly focus on manipulating the denoising sampling process to steer image embeddings away from the memorized embedding space or employ unlearning methods that require training on datasets containing specific sets of memorized concepts. However, existing methods often incur substantial computational overhead during sampling, or focus narrowly on removing one or more groups of target concepts, imposing a significant limitation on their scalability. To understand and mitigate these problems, our work, UniForget, offers a new perspective on understanding the root cause of memorization. Our work demonstrates that specific parts of the model are responsible for copyrighted content generation. By applying model pruning, we can effectively suppress the probability of generating copyrighted content without targeting specific concepts while preserving the general generative capabilities of the model. Additionally, we show that our approach is both orthogonal and complementary to existing unlearning methods, thereby highlighting its potential to improve current unlearning and de-memorization techniques.

Abstract: Estimating the 6-degrees-of-freedom (6DoF) pose of a spacecraft from a single image is critical for autonomous operations like in-orbit servicing and space debris removal. Existing state-of-the-art methods often rely on iterative Perspective-n-Point (PnP)-based algorithms, which are computationally intensive and ill-suited for real-time deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. To overcome these limitations, we propose FastPose-ViT, a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architecture that directly regresses the 6DoF pose. Our approach processes cropped images from object bounding boxes and introduces a novel mathematical formalism to map these localized predictions back to the full-image scale. This formalism is derived from the principles of projective geometry and the concept of "apparent rotation", where the model predicts an apparent rotation matrix that is then corrected to find the true orientation. We demonstrate that our method outperforms other non-PnP strategies and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art PnP-based techniques on the SPEED dataset. Furthermore, we validate our model's suitability for real-world space missions by quantizing it and deploying it on power-constrained edge hardware. On the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano, our end-to-end pipeline achieves a latency of ~75 ms per frame under sequential execution, and a non-blocking throughput of up to 33 FPS when stages are scheduled concurrently.

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has become a promising direction for medical image segmentation, enabling models to learn from limited labeled data alongside abundant unlabeled samples. However, existing SSL approaches for multi-modal medical imaging often struggle to exploit the complementary information between modalities due to semantic discrepancies and misalignment across MRI sequences. To address this, we propose a novel semi-supervised multi-modal framework that explicitly enhances modality-specific representations and facilitates adaptive cross-modal information fusion. Specifically, we introduce a Modality-specific Enhancing Module (MEM) to strengthen semantic cues unique to each modality via channel-wise attention, and a learnable Complementary Information Fusion (CIF) module to adaptively exchange complementary knowledge between modalities. The overall framework is optimized using a hybrid objective combining supervised segmentation loss and cross-modal consistency regularization on unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2019 (HGG subset) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong semi-supervised and multi-modal baselines under 1\%, 5\%, and 10\% labeled data settings, achieving significant improvements in both Dice and Sensitivity scores. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary effects of our proposed MEM and CIF in bridging cross-modality discrepancies and improving segmentation robustness under scarce supervision.

Abstract: Personalized Text-to-Image (PT2I) generation aims to produce customized images based on reference images. A prominent interest pertains to the integration of an image prompt adapter to facilitate zero-shot PT2I without test-time fine-tuning. However, current methods grapple with three fundamental challenges: 1. the elusive equilibrium between Concept Preservation (CP) and Prompt Following (PF), 2. the difficulty in retaining fine-grained concept details in reference images, and 3. the restricted scalability to extend to multi-subject personalization. To tackle these challenges, we present Dynamic Image Prompt Adapter (DynaIP), a cutting-edge plugin to enhance the fine-grained concept fidelity, CP-PF balance, and subject scalability of SOTA T2I multimodal diffusion transformers (MM-DiT) for PT2I generation. Our key finding is that MM-DiT inherently exhibit decoupling learning behavior when injecting reference image features into its dual branches via cross attentions. Based on this, we design an innovative Dynamic Decoupling Strategy that removes the interference of concept-agnostic information during inference, significantly enhancing the CP-PF balance and further bolstering the scalability of multi-subject compositions. Moreover, we identify the visual encoder as a key factor affecting fine-grained CP and reveal that the hierarchical features of commonly used CLIP can capture visual information at diverse granularity levels. Therefore, we introduce a novel Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts Feature Fusion Module to fully leverage the hierarchical features of CLIP, remarkably elevating the fine-grained concept fidelity while also providing flexible control of visual granularity. Extensive experiments across single- and multi-subject PT2I tasks verify that our DynaIP outperforms existing approaches, marking a notable advancement in the field of PT2l generation.

Abstract: Understanding human skill performance is essential for intelligent assistive systems, with struggle recognition offering a natural cue for identifying user difficulties. While prior work focuses on offline struggle classification and localization, real-time applications require models capable of detecting and anticipating struggle online. We reformulate struggle localization as an online detection task and further extend it to anticipation, predicting struggle moments before they occur. We adapt two off-the-shelf models as baselines for online struggle detection and anticipation. Online struggle detection achieves 70-80% per-frame mAP, while struggle anticipation up to 2 seconds ahead yields comparable performance with slight drops. We further examine generalization across tasks and activities and analyse the impact of skill evolution. Despite larger domain gaps in activity-level generalization, models still outperform random baselines by 4-20%. Our feature-based models run at up to 143 FPS, and the whole pipeline, including feature extraction, operates at around 20 FPS, sufficient for real-time assistive applications.

Abstract: Autonomous driving (AD) systems struggle in long-tail scenarios due to limited world knowledge and weak visual dynamic modeling. Existing vision-language-action (VLA)-based methods cannot leverage unlabeled videos for visual causal learning, while world model-based methods lack reasoning capabilities from large language models. In this paper, we construct multiple specialized datasets providing reasoning and planning annotations for complex scenarios. Then, a unified Understanding-Generation-Planning framework, named UniUGP, is proposed to synergize scene reasoning, future video generation, and trajectory planning through a hybrid expert architecture. By integrating pre-trained VLMs and video generation models, UniUGP leverages visual dynamics and semantic reasoning to enhance planning performance. Taking multi-frame observations and language instructions as input, it produces interpretable chain-of-thought reasoning, physically consistent trajectories, and coherent future videos. We introduce a four-stage training strategy that progressively builds these capabilities across multiple existing AD datasets, along with the proposed specialized datasets. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in perception, reasoning, and decision-making, with superior generalization to challenging long-tail situations.

Abstract: Linear spectral mixture models (LMM) provide a concise form to disentangle the constituent materials (endmembers) and their corresponding proportions (abundance) in a single pixel. The critical challenges are how to model the spectral prior distribution and spectral variability. Prior knowledge and spectral variability can be rigorously modeled under the Bayesian framework, where posterior estimation of Abundance is derived by combining observed data with endmember prior distribution. Considering the key challenges and the advantages of the Bayesian framework, a novel method using a diffusion posterior sampler for semiblind unmixing, denoted as DPS4Un, is proposed to deal with these challenges with the following features: (1) we view the pretrained conditional spectrum diffusion model as a posterior sampler, which can combine the learned endmember prior with observation to get the refined abundance distribution. (2) Instead of using the existing spectral library as prior, which may raise bias, we establish the image-based endmember bundles within superpixels, which are used to train the endmember prior learner with diffusion model. Superpixels make sure the sub-scene is more homogeneous. (3) Instead of using the image-level data consistency constraint, the superpixel-based data fidelity term is proposed. (4) The endmember is initialized as Gaussian noise for each superpixel region, DPS4Un iteratively updates the abundance and endmember, contributing to spectral variability modeling. The experimental results on three real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that DPS4Un outperforms the state-of-the-art hyperspectral unmixing methods.

Abstract: Correctly parsing mathematical formulas from PDFs is critical for training large language models and building scientific knowledge bases from academic literature, yet existing benchmarks either exclude formulas entirely or lack semantically-aware evaluation metrics. We introduce a novel benchmarking framework centered on synthetically generated PDFs with precise LaTeX ground truth, enabling systematic control over layout, formulas, and content characteristics. A key methodological contribution is pioneering LLM-as-a-judge for semantic formula assessment, combined with a robust two-stage matching pipeline that handles parser output inconsistencies. Through human validation on 250 formula pairs (750 ratings from 30 evaluators), we demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation achieves substantially higher correlation with human judgment (Pearson r=0.78) compared to CDM (r=0.34) and text similarity (r~0). Evaluating 20+ contemporary PDF parsers (including specialized OCR models, vision-language models, and rule-based approaches) across 100 synthetic documents with 2,000+ formulas reveals significant performance disparities. Our findings provide crucial insights for practitioners selecting parsers for downstream applications and establish a robust, scalable methodology that enables reproducible evaluation of PDF formula extraction quality.

Abstract: Radiance field representations have recently been explored in the latent space of VAEs that are commonly used by diffusion models. This direction offers efficient rendering and seamless integration with diffusion-based pipelines. However, these methods face a fundamental limitation: The VAE latent space lacks multi-view consistency, leading to blurred textures and missing details during 3D reconstruction. Existing approaches attempt to address this by fine-tuning the VAE, at the cost of reconstruction quality, or by relying on pre-trained diffusion models to recover fine-grained details, at the risk of some hallucinations. We present Splatent, a diffusion-based enhancement framework designed to operate on top of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) in the latent space of VAEs. Our key insight departs from the conventional 3D-centric view: rather than reconstructing fine-grained details in 3D space, we recover them in 2D from input views through multi-view attention mechanisms. This approach preserves the reconstruction quality of pretrained VAEs while achieving faithful detail recovery. Evaluated across multiple benchmarks, Splatent establishes a new state-of-the-art for VAE latent radiance field reconstruction. We further demonstrate that integrating our method with existing feed-forward frameworks, consistently improves detail preservation, opening new possibilities for high-quality sparse-view 3D reconstruction.

Abstract: Video unified models exhibit strong capabilities in understanding and generation, yet they struggle with reason-informed visual editing even when equipped with powerful internal vision-language models (VLMs). We attribute this gap to two factors: 1) existing datasets are inadequate for training and evaluating reasoning-aware video editing, and 2) an inherent disconnect between the models' reasoning and editing capabilities, which prevents the rich understanding from effectively instructing the editing process. Bridging this gap requires an integrated framework that connects reasoning with visual transformation. To address this gap, we introduce the Reason-Informed Video Editing (RVE) task, which requires reasoning about physical plausibility and causal dynamics during editing. To support systematic evaluation, we construct RVE-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark with two complementary subsets: Reasoning-Informed Video Editing and In-Context Video Generation. These subsets cover diverse reasoning dimensions and real-world editing scenarios. Building upon this foundation, we propose the ReViSE, a Self-Reflective Reasoning (SRF) framework that unifies generation and evaluation within a single architecture.

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting-based inverse rendering extend Gaussian primitives with shading parameters and physically grounded light transport, enabling high-quality material recovery from dense multi-view captures. However, these methods degrade sharply under sparse-view settings, where limited observations lead to severe ambiguity between geometry, reflectance, and lighting. We introduce GAINS (Gaussian-based Inverse rendering from Sparse multi-view captures), a two-stage inverse rendering framework that leverages learning-based priors to stabilize geometry and material estimation. GAINS first refines geometry using monocular depth/normal and diffusion priors, then employs segmentation, intrinsic image decomposition (IID), and diffusion priors to regularize material recovery. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that GAINS significantly improves material parameter accuracy, relighting quality, and novel-view synthesis compared to state-of-the-art Gaussian-based inverse rendering methods, especially under sparse-view settings.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Knowledge transfer plays a crucial role in cross-scene hyperspectral imaging (HSI). However, existing studies often overlook the challenges of gradient conflicts and dominant gradients that arise during the optimization of shared parameters. Moreover, many current approaches fail to simultaneously capture both agreement and disagreement information, relying only on a limited shared subset of target features and consequently missing the rich, diverse patterns present in the target scene. To address these issues, we propose an Agreement Disagreement Guided Knowledge Transfer (ADGKT) framework that integrates both mechanisms to enhance cross-scene transfer. The agreement component includes GradVac, which aligns gradient directions to mitigate conflicts between source and target domains, and LogitNorm, which regulates logit magnitudes to prevent domination by a single gradient source. The disagreement component consists of a Disagreement Restriction (DiR) and an ensemble strategy, which capture diverse predictive target features and mitigate the loss of critical target information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in achieving robust and balanced knowledge transfer across heterogeneous HSI scenes.

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 本文为医学图像分割任务开发了一个因果归因框架，可量化采集协议和标注变异如何独立导致模型性能下降；在多发性硬化病灶分割数据集上的验证表明，标注协议偏移在跨标注者时主导性能下降，而采集偏移在跨成像中心时主导下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在医学图像分割中常因分布偏移导致性能显著下降，但其背后的因果机制尚不明确。现有方法难以量化高维分割任务中各因素（如采集协议、标注变异）的独立贡献，限制了针对性的干预措施制定。

Method: 通过因果图建模数据生成过程，并采用Shapley值公平地归因性能变化至单个机制。框架专门针对医学成像的高维输出、有限样本和复杂机制交互等挑战进行设计。在多发性硬化病灶分割数据上验证（4个中心、7名标注者）。

Result: 验证揭示了上下文依赖的失败模式：跨标注者时，标注协议偏移主导性能下降（7.4%±8.9% DSC归因）；跨成像中心时，采集偏移主导下降（6.5%±9.1%）。这种机制特异性量化可帮助从业者根据部署上下文优先采取针对性干预措施。

Conclusion: 提出的因果归因框架能有效量化医学图像分割中不同分布偏移机制对性能的独立贡献，为实际部署中优先解决特定类型偏移提供了科学依据，有望指导更有效的模型干预策略。

Abstract: Deep learning models for medical image segmentation suffer significant performance drops due to distribution shifts, but the causal mechanisms behind these drops remain poorly understood. We extend causal attribution frameworks to high-dimensional segmentation tasks, quantifying how acquisition protocols and annotation variability independently contribute to performance degradation. We model the data-generating process through a causal graph and employ Shapley values to fairly attribute performance changes to individual mechanisms. Our framework addresses unique challenges in medical imaging: high-dimensional outputs, limited samples, and complex mechanism interactions. Validation on multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation across 4 centers and 7 annotators reveals context-dependent failure modes: annotation protocol shifts dominate when crossing annotators (7.4% $\pm$ 8.9% DSC attribution), while acquisition shifts dominate when crossing imaging centers (6.5% $\pm$ 9.1%). This mechanism-specific quantification enables practitioners to prioritize targeted interventions based on deployment context.

*Aseel Rawashdeh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究针对移动健康干预中强化学习的测量成本问题，提出了一种基于贝叶斯更新的ATM方法（Bayesian ATM），用卡尔曼滤波式更新替代传统Q学习，在保持Q值不确定性的同时实现了更稳定高效的强化学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动健康干预中的强化学习需要在干预效果和用户负担之间取得平衡，特别是当状态测量（如用户调查或反馈）成本高昂但又至关重要时。标准的Act-Then-Measure（ATM）启发式虽然能在ACNO-MDP框架下分离控制和测量动作，但其依赖的时间差分Q学习方法在稀疏和嘈杂环境中容易不稳定。

Method: 提出了一种贝叶斯扩展的ATM方法，用基于卡尔曼滤波的贝叶斯更新替代标准Q学习，维护了Q值的不确定性感知估计。该方法在小型表格环境和临床动机测试平台中进行评估，对比了标准ATM和贝叶斯ATM的性能差异。

Result: 在小型表格环境中，贝叶斯ATM实现了相当或改进的标量化回报，但方差显著降低且策略行为更稳定。然而在更大、更复杂的移动健康环境中，标准和贝叶斯ATM变体表现均不佳，表明ATM的建模假设与真实移动健康领域中的结构性挑战存在不匹配。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯ATM显示了不确定性感知方法在低数据环境中的价值，但突显了需要开发能够显式建模因果结构、连续状态和观测成本约束下延迟反馈的新强化学习算法的必要性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in mobile health (mHealth) interventions requires balancing intervention efficacy with user burden, particularly when state measurements (for example, user surveys or feedback) are costly yet essential. The Act-Then-Measure (ATM) heuristic addresses this challenge by decoupling control and measurement actions within the Action-Contingent Noiselessly Observable Markov Decision Process (ACNO-MDP) framework. However, the standard ATM algorithm relies on a temporal-difference-inspired Q-learning method, which is prone to instability in sparse and noisy environments. In this work, we propose a Bayesian extension to ATM that replaces standard Q-learning with a Kalman filter-style Bayesian update, maintaining uncertainty-aware estimates of Q-values and enabling more stable and sample-efficient learning. We evaluate our method in both toy environments and clinically motivated testbeds. In small, tabular environments, Bayesian ATM achieves comparable or improved scalarized returns with substantially lower variance and more stable policy behavior. In contrast, in larger and more complex mHealth settings, both the standard and Bayesian ATM variants perform poorly, suggesting a mismatch between ATM's modeling assumptions and the structural challenges of real-world mHealth domains. These findings highlight the value of uncertainty-aware methods in low-data settings while underscoring the need for new RL algorithms that explicitly model causal structure, continuous states, and delayed feedback under observation cost constraints.

Abstract: Testing humanoid robots with users is slow, causes wear, and limits iteration and diversity. Yet screening agents must master conversational timing, prosody, backchannels, and what to attend to in faces and speech for Depression and PTSD. Most simulators omit policy learning with nonverbal dynamics; many controllers chase task accuracy while underweighting trust, pacing, and rapport. We virtualise the humanoid as a conversational agent to train without hardware burden. Our agent-centred, simulation-first pipeline turns interview data into 276 Unreal Engine MetaHuman patients with synchronised speech, gaze/face, and head-torso poses, plus PHQ-8 and PCL-C flows. A perception-fusion-policy loop decides what and when to speak, when to backchannel, and how to avoid interruptions, under a safety shield. Training uses counterfactual replay (bounded nonverbal perturbations) and an uncertainty-aware turn manager that probes to reduce diagnostic ambiguity. Results are simulation-only; the humanoid is the transfer target. In comparing three controllers, a custom TD3 (Twin Delayed DDPG) outperformed PPO and CEM, achieving near-ceiling coverage with steadier pace at comparable rewards. Decision-quality analyses show negligible turn overlap, aligned cut timing, fewer clarification prompts, and shorter waits. Performance stays stable under modality dropout and a renderer swap, and rankings hold on a held-out patient split. Contributions: (1) an agent-centred simulator that turns interviews into 276 interactive patients with bounded nonverbal counterfactuals; (2) a safe learning loop that treats timing and rapport as first-class control variables; (3) a comparative study (TD3 vs PPO/CEM) with clear gains in completeness and social timing; and (4) ablations and robustness analyses explaining the gains and enabling clinician-supervised humanoid pilots.

Abstract: In the process of patient diagnosis, non-invasive measurements are widely used due to their low risks and quick results. Electrocardiogram (ECG), as a non-invasive method to collect heart activities, is used to diagnose cardiac conditions. Analyzing the ECG typically requires domain expertise, which is a roadblock to applying artificial intelligence (AI) for healthcare. Through advances in self-supervised learning and foundation models, AI systems can now acquire and leverage domain knowledge without relying solely on human expertise. However, there is a lack of comprehensive analyses over the foundation models' performance on ECG. This study aims to answer the research question: "Are Foundation Models Useful for ECG Analysis?" To address it, we evaluate language/general time-series/ECG foundation models in comparison with time-series deep learning models. The experimental results show that general time-series/ECG foundation models achieve a top performance rate of 80%, indicating their effectiveness in ECG analysis. In-depth analyses and insights are provided along with comprehensive experimental results. This study highlights the limitations and potential of foundation models in advancing physiological waveform analysis.

Abstract: Extremely large-scale massive multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is a key enabler for sixth-generation (6G) networks, offering massive spatial degrees of freedom. Despite these advantages, the coexistence of near-field and far-field effects in hybrid-field channels presents significant challenges for accurate estimation, where traditional methods often struggle to generalize effectively. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on downstream tasks via fine-tuning, aligning with the semantic communication shift toward task-oriented understanding over bit-level accuracy.
  Motivated by this, we propose Large Language Models for XL-MIMO Channel Estimation (LLM4XCE), a novel channel estimation framework that leverages the semantic modeling capabilities of large language models to recover essential spatial-channel representations for downstream tasks. The model integrates a carefully designed embedding module with Parallel Feature-Spatial Attention, enabling deep fusion of pilot features and spatial structures to construct a semantically rich representation for LLM input. By fine-tuning only the top two Transformer layers, our method effectively captures latent dependencies in the pilot data while ensuring high training efficiency. Extensive simulations demonstrate that LLM4XCE significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods under hybrid-field conditions, achieving superior estimation accuracy and generalization performance.

Abstract: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is one of the most used ML classifiers. However, if we observe closely, standard distance-weighted KNN and relative variants assume all 'k' neighbors are equally reliable. In heterogeneous feature space, this becomes a limitation that hinders reliability in predicting true levels of the observation.
  We propose DW-KNN (Double Weighted KNN), a transparent and robust variant that integrates exponential distance with neighbor validity. This enables instance-level interpretability, suppresses noisy or mislabeled samples, and reduces hyperparameter sensitivity.
  Comprehensive evaluation on 9 data-sets helps to demonstrate that DW-KNN achieves 0.8988 accuracy on average. It ranks 2nd among six methods and within 0.2% of the best-performing Ensemble KNN. It also exhibits the lowest cross-validation variance (0.0156), indicating reliable prediction stability. Statistical significance test confirmed ($p < 0.001$) improvement over compactness weighted KNN (+4.09\%) and Kernel weighted KNN (+1.13\%). The method provides a simple yet effective alternative to complex adaptive schemes, particularly valuable for high-stakes applications requiring explainable predictions.

TL;DR: 这篇论文证明，可以通过深度学习方法高效学习包含广义Radon变换和测地线射线变换的双纤维化变换类算子，即使在传播奇异性的问题中也能避免维度灾难，误差衰减速度超过训练样本数量的任何固定幂次。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前深度学习方法已能有效学习椭圆算子等简单几何结构的算子，但科学机器学习常涉及未知方式的奇异性传播问题（如波动、平流、流体动力学）。现有理论未能涵盖双纤维化变换这类几何积分算子，因此需要拓展学习理论以解释其数据高效性。

Method: 将学习理论拓展到双纤维化变换类，证明这类算子不存在维度灾难问题。同时研究能显式编码这些变换几何结构的架构，提出一种基于水平集方法的交叉注意力式架构，确保其普适性、稳定性和高效学习能力。

Result: 证明双纤维化变换类算子可以实现超代数误差衰减（误差衰减速度超过训练样本数倒数的任何固定幂次），且提出的架构能仅用极少训练样本有效学习这类算子。

Conclusion: 该研究为科学机器学习中算子学习理论提供了重要扩展，证明了包含奇异性传播问题的几何积分算子也能实现数据高效学习，为波动、平流等复杂物理问题的学习提供了理论支撑。

Abstract: Deep learning methods have proven capable of recovering operators between high-dimensional spaces, such as solution maps of PDEs and similar objects in mathematical physics, from very few training samples. This phenomenon of data-efficiency has been proven for certain classes of elliptic operators with simple geometry, i.e., operators that do not change the domain of the function or propagate singularities. However, scientific machine learning is commonly used for problems that do involve the propagation of singularities in a priori unknown ways, such as waves, advection, and fluid dynamics. In light of this, we expand the learning theory to include double fibration transforms--geometric integral operators that include generalized Radon and geodesic ray transforms. We prove that this class of operators does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality: the error decays superalgebraically, that is, faster than any fixed power of the reciprocal of the number of training samples. Furthermore, we investigate architectures that explicitly encode the geometry of these transforms, demonstrating that an architecture reminiscent of cross-attention based on levelset methods yields a parameterization that is universal, stable, and learns double fibration transforms from very few training examples. Our results contribute to a rapidly-growing line of theoretical work on learning operators for scientific machine learning.

Motivation: 传统用户行为预测方法依赖任务特定模型和手工特征工程，耗时、计算成本高、需要领域知识且难以扩展。LUMOS旨在通过统一框架解决这些可扩展性问题。

Method: 提出基于Transformer的LUMOS架构：1）使用多模态分词将用户交易、事件上下文和静态属性转换为丰富表示；2）引入跨注意力机制使预测能够条件于未来已知事件；3）通过专用嵌入路径处理不同类型数据。

Result: 在包含2750亿用户活动token、2.5亿用户的生产数据集上评估：在5个任务上平均ROC-AUC提升0.025(二元分类)，MAPE降低4.6%(回归)。线上AB测试显示日活用户提升3.15%。

Conclusion: LUMOS通过多任务联合学习和跨注意力机制，有效解决了传统方法的可扩展性问题，实现了更优的性能和显著的商业影响，为大规模用户行为预测提供了统一解决方案。

Abstract: User behavior prediction at scale remains a critical challenge for online B2C platforms. Traditional approaches rely heavily on task-specific models and domain-specific feature engineering. This is time-consuming, computationally expensive, and requires domain expertise and therefore not scalable. We present LUMOS (Large User MOdel Series), a transformer-based architecture that eliminates task-specific models and manual feature engineering by learning multiple tasks jointly using only raw user activity data. LUMOS introduces a novel cross-attention mechanism that conditions predictions on future known events (e.g., holidays, sales, etc.), enabling the model to predict complex behaviour patterns like "how will upcoming holidays affect user engagement?" The architecture also employs multi-modal tokenization, combining user transactions, event context, and static user demographic attributes into rich representations processed through specialized embedding pathways.
  Through extensive experiments on a production dataset spanning 275 billion user activity tokens from 250 million users, we demonstrate that LUMOS achieves superior performance compared to traditional task-specific models. Across 5 tasks with established baselines, we achieve an average improvement of 0.025 in ROC-AUC for binary classification tasks and 4.6\% reduction in MAPE for regression tasks. Online A/B testing validates these improvements translate to measurable business impact with a 3.15\% increase in Daily Active Users.

Motivation: 传统的低秩适配(LoRA)在持续学习中存在灾难性遗忘问题，主要是由于新任务梯度与历史权重轨迹之间存在的对抗性方向更新导致破坏性干扰。需要解决这种冲突以保持学习表示的稳定性。

Method: 1. 提出PS-LoRA框架，在优化子空间内对齐更新解决冲突
2. 采用双重正则化目标：惩罚冲突方向并约束幅度偏差以确保与先验知识一致性
3. 实施基于幅度的合并策略，将顺序适配器整合为鲁棒表示而无需重新训练

Conclusion: PS-LoRA通过解决优化冲突和合并策略，有效缓解了LoRA在持续学习中的灾难性遗忘问题，实现了更好的任务适应性和表示稳定性。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enables efficient Continual Learning but often suffers from catastrophic forgetting due to destructive interference between tasks. Our analysis reveals that this degradation is primarily driven by antagonistic directional updates where new task gradients directly oppose the historical weight trajectory. To address this, we propose PS-LoRA (Parameter Stability LoRA), a framework designed to resolve conflicts by aligning updates within the optimization subspace. Our approach employs a dual-regularization objective that penalizes conflicting directions and constrains magnitude deviations to ensure consistency with prior knowledge. Additionally, we implement a magnitude-based merging strategy to consolidate sequential adapters into a robust representation without retraining. Experiments on NLP and Vision benchmarks show that PS-LoRA outperforms state-of-the-art methods by preserving the stability of learned representations while efficiently adapting to new domains.

Abstract: Language Models (LMs) struggle with complex, interdependent instructions, particularly in high-stakes domains like finance where precision is critical. We introduce FIFE, a novel, high-difficulty benchmark designed to assess LM instruction-following capabilities for financial analysis tasks. FIFE comprises 88 human-authored prompts and employs a verification system with chainable, verifiable constraints for fine-grained reward signals. We evaluate 53 models (proprietary, open-weight, open-source) in a zero-shot setting. Our key findings reveal a clear performance hierarchy: the top open-weight model (76.1 strict / 79.5 loose) surpasses the leading proprietary system (65.9 strict / 70.5 loose), while the best open-source models lag significantly (45.5 strict / 48.9 loose). However, even top-performing models struggle with FIFE's complex requirements, failing to achieve perfect compliance. We release our dataset and code as an open-source resource to promote research in Reinforcement Learning for the financial domain.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to their widespread adoption in daily applications. Despite their impressive capabilities, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, as even minor meaning-preserving changes such as synonym substitutions can lead to incorrect predictions. As a result, certifying the robustness of LLMs against such adversarial prompts is of vital importance. Existing approaches focused on word deletion or simple denoising strategies to achieve robustness certification. However, these methods face two critical limitations: (1) they yield loose robustness bounds due to the lack of semantic validation for perturbed outputs and (2) they suffer from high computational costs due to repeated sampling. To address these limitations, we propose CluCERT, a novel framework for certifying LLM robustness via clustering-guided denoising smoothing. Specifically, to achieve tighter certified bounds, we introduce a semantic clustering filter that reduces noisy samples and retains meaningful perturbations, supported by theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we enhance computational efficiency through two mechanisms: a refine module that extracts core semantics, and a fast synonym substitution strategy that accelerates the denoising process. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on various downstream tasks and jailbreak defense scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing certified approaches in both robustness bounds and computational efficiency.

Abstract: The rapid scaling of large computational models has led to a critical increase in energy and compute costs. Inspired by biological systems where structure and function emerge from low-energy configurations, we introduce StructuredDNA, a sparse architecture framework for modular, energy-aware Transformer routing. StructuredDNA replaces dense Mixture-of-Experts routing with a bio-physical, energy-guided routing layer based on semantic energy minimization. Inputs are dynamically grouped into semantic codons, and routing selects a single expert by minimizing a global energy functional that combines cohesion, uncertainty, and computational cost.
  We validate StructuredDNA on both specialized (BioASQ) and open-domain benchmarks (WikiText-103). On BioASQ (K = 50), we achieve a 97.7% reduction in Energy Utilization Density (EUD) and a Semantic Stability Index (SSI) of 0.998. We further demonstrate a Semantic Scaling Law on WikiText-103, showing that the architecture generalizes to open domains by scaling expert granularity (K = 2048) while maintaining more than 99% energy efficiency. StructuredDNA thus establishes a robust, domain-agnostic paradigm for future sparse computational frameworks.
  StructuredDNA provides an explicit link between bio-physical principles and sparse expert routing in Transformer architectures, and points toward future energy-aware, modular, and scalable computational systems. We discuss limitations of this proof-of-concept study and outline directions for scaling the approach to larger models, datasets, and hardware platforms. The StructuredDNA implementation is available at https://github.com/InnoDeep-repos/StructuredDNA .

Abstract: We introduce Contrastive Region Masking (CRM), a training free diagnostic that reveals how multimodal large language models (MLLMs) depend on specific visual regions at each step of chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. Unlike prior approaches limited to final answers or attention maps, CRM provides causal, step-level attri- bution by systematically masking annotated regions and contrasting the resulting reasoning traces with unmasked baselines. Applied to datasets such as VisArgs, CRM reveals distinct failure modes: some models preserve reasoning structure, but hallucinate when evidence is missing, while others ground tightly to visual cues yet collapse under perturbations. By shifting the evaluation from correctness of an- swers to faithfulness of reasoning, CRM reframes visual benchmarks as diagnostic tools, highlighting the need for multimodal evaluation frameworks that measure not just performance, but also robustness and fidelity of reasoning.

Abstract: Accurate and reliable probability predictions are essential for multi-class supervised learning tasks, where well-calibrated models enable rational decision-making. While isotonic regression has proven effective for binary calibration, its extension to multi-class problems via one-vs-rest calibration produced suboptimal results when compared to parametric methods, limiting its practical adoption. In this work, we propose novel isotonic normalization-aware techniques for multiclass calibration, grounded in natural and intuitive assumptions expected by practitioners. Unlike prior approaches, our methods inherently account for probability normalization by either incorporating normalization directly into the optimization process (NA-FIR) or modeling the problem as a cumulative bivariate isotonic regression (SCIR). Empirical evaluation on a variety of text and image classification datasets across different model architectures reveals that our approach consistently improves negative log-likelihood (NLL) and expected calibration error (ECE) metrics.

Abstract: Accurate precipitation forecasting is essential for hydrometeorological risk management, especially for anticipating extreme rainfall that can lead to flash flooding and infrastructure damage. This study introduces a diffusion-based deep learning (DL) framework that systematically compares three residual prediction strategies differing only in their input sources: (1) a fully data-driven model using only past observations from the Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor (MRMS) system, (2) a corrective model using only forecasts from the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) numerical weather prediction system, and (3) a hybrid model integrating both MRMS and selected HRRR forecast variables. By evaluating these approaches under a unified setup, we provide a clearer understanding of how each data source contributes to predictive skill over the Continental United States (CONUS). Forecasts are produced at 1-km spatial resolution, beginning with direct 1-hour predictions and extending to 12 hours using autoregressive rollouts. Performance is evaluated using both CONUS-wide and region-specific metrics that assess overall performance and skill at extreme rainfall thresholds. Across all lead times, our DL framework consistently outperforms the HRRR baseline in pixel-wise and spatiostatistical metrics. The hybrid model performs best at the shortest lead time, while the HRRR-corrective model outperforms others at longer lead times, maintaining high skill through 12 hours. To assess reliability, we incorporate calibrated uncertainty quantification tailored to the residual learning setup. These gains, particularly at longer lead times, are critical for emergency preparedness, where modest increases in forecast horizon can improve decision-making. This work advances DL-based precipitation forecasting by enhancing predictive skill, reliability, and applicability across regions.

Abstract: Neural networks, while effective for tackling many challenging scientific tasks, are not known to perform well out-of-distribution (OOD), i.e., within domains which differ from their training data. Understanding neural network OOD generalization is paramount to their successful deployment in experimental workflows, especially when ground-truth knowledge about the experiment is hard to establish or experimental conditions significantly vary. With inherent access to ground-truth information and fine-grained control of underlying distributions, simulation-based data curation facilitates precise investigation of OOD generalization behavior. Here, we probe generalization with respect to imaging conditions of neural network segmentation models for high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) imaging of nanoparticles, training and measuring the OOD generalization of over 12,000 neural networks using synthetic data generated via random structure sampling and multislice simulation. Using the HRTEM contrast transfer function, we further develop a framework to compare information content of HRTEM datasets and quantify OOD domain shifts. We demonstrate that neural network segmentation models enjoy significant performance stability, but will smoothly and predictably worsen as imaging conditions shift from the training distribution. Lastly, we consider limitations of our approach in explaining other OOD shifts, such as of the atomic structures, and discuss complementary techniques for understanding generalization in such settings.

Abstract: Severe heatwaves in urban areas significantly threaten public health, calling for establishing early warning strategies. Despite predicting occurrence of heatwaves and attributing historical mortality, predicting an incoming deadly heatwave remains a challenge due to the difficulty in defining and estimating heat-related mortality. Furthermore, establishing an early warning system imposes additional requirements, including data availability, spatial and temporal robustness, and decision costs. To address these challenges, we propose DeepTherm, a modular early warning system for deadly heatwave prediction without requiring heat-related mortality history. By highlighting the flexibility of deep learning, DeepTherm employs a dual-prediction pipeline, disentangling baseline mortality in the absence of heatwaves and other irregular events from all-cause mortality. We evaluated DeepTherm on real-world data across Spain. Results demonstrate consistent, robust, and accurate performance across diverse regions, time periods, and population groups while allowing trade-off between missed alarms and false alarms.

Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem offers a theoretical alternative to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) by placing learnable univariate functions on edges rather than nodes. While recent implementations such as Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) demonstrate high approximation capabilities, they suffer from significant parameter inefficiency due to the requirement of maintaining unique parameterizations for every network edge. In this work, we propose GS-KAN (Generalized Sprecher-KAN), a lightweight architecture inspired by David Sprecher's refinement of the superposition theorem. GS-KAN constructs unique edge functions by applying learnable linear transformations to a single learnable, shared parent function per layer. We evaluate GS-KAN against existing KAN architectures and MLPs across synthetic function approximation, tabular data regression and image classification tasks. Our results demonstrate that GS-KAN outperforms both MLPs and standard KAN baselines on continuous function approximation tasks while maintaining superior parameter efficiency. Additionally, GS-KAN achieves competitive performance with existing KAN architectures on tabular regression and outperforms MLPs on high-dimensional classification tasks. Crucially, the proposed architecture enables the deployment of KAN-based architectures in high-dimensional regimes under strict parameter constraints, a setting where standard implementations are typically infeasible due to parameter explosion.

Abstract: Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) have become a central tool in data-driven operator learning, providing flexible surrogates for nonlinear mappings arising in partial differential equations (PDEs). However, the standard trunk design based on fully connected layers acting on raw spatial or spatiotemporal coordinates struggles to represent sharp gradients, boundary layers, and non-periodic structures commonly found in PDEs posed on bounded domains with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions. To address these limitations, we introduce the Spectral-Embedded DeepONet (SEDONet), a new DeepONet variant in which the trunk is driven by a fixed Chebyshev spectral dictionary rather than coordinate inputs. This non-periodic spectral embedding provides a principled inductive bias tailored to bounded domains, enabling the learned operator to capture fine-scale non-periodic features that are difficult for Fourier or MLP trunks to represent. SEDONet is evaluated on a suite of PDE benchmarks including 2D Poisson, 1D Burgers, 1D advection-diffusion, Allen-Cahn dynamics, and the Lorenz-96 chaotic system, covering elliptic, parabolic, advective, and multiscale temporal phenomena, all of which can be viewed as canonical problems in computational mechanics. Across all datasets, SEDONet consistently achieves the lowest relative L2 errors among DeepONet, FEDONet, and SEDONet, with average improvements of about 30-40% over the baseline DeepONet and meaningful gains over Fourier-embedded variants on non-periodic geometries. Spectral analyses further show that SEDONet more accurately preserves high-frequency and boundary-localized features, demonstrating the value of Chebyshev embeddings in non-periodic operator learning. The proposed architecture offers a simple, parameter-neutral modification to DeepONets, delivering a robust and efficient spectral framework for surrogate modeling of PDEs on bounded domains.

Abstract: Transformers and more specifically decoder-only transformers dominate modern LLM architectures. While they have shown to work exceptionally well, they are not without issues, resulting in surprising failure modes and predictably asymmetric performance degradation. This article is a study of many of these observed failure modes of transformers through the lens of graph neural network (GNN) theory. We first make the case that much of deep learning, including transformers, is about learnable information mixing and propagation. This makes the study of model failure modes a study of bottlenecks in information propagation. This naturally leads to GNN theory, where there is already a rich literature on information propagation bottlenecks and theoretical failure modes of models. We then make the case that many issues faced by GNNs are also experienced by transformers. In addition, we analyze how the causal nature of decoder-only transformers create interesting geometric properties in information propagation, resulting in predictable and potentially devastating failure modes. Finally, we observe that existing solutions in transformer research tend to be ad-hoc and driven by intuition rather than grounded theoretical motivation. As such, we unify many such solutions under a more theoretical perspective, providing insight into why they work, what problem they are actually solving, and how they can be further improved to target specific failure modes of transformers. Overall, this article is an attempt to bridge the gap between observed failure modes in transformers and a general lack of theoretical understanding of them in this space.

Abstract: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) has emerged as a minimally invasive treatment option for patients with severe aortic stenosis, a life-threatening cardiovascular condition. Multiple transcatheter heart valves (THV) have been approved for use in TAVR, but current guidelines regarding valve type prescription remain an active topic of debate. We propose a data-driven clinical support tool to identify the optimal valve type with the objective of minimizing the risk of permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI), a predominant postoperative complication. We synthesize a novel dataset that combines U.S. and Greek patient populations and integrates three distinct data sources (patient demographics, computed tomography scans, echocardiograms) while harmonizing differences in each country's record system. We introduce a leaf-level analysis to leverage population heterogeneity and avoid benchmarking against uncertain counterfactual risk estimates. The final prescriptive model shows a reduction in PPI rates of 26% and 16% compared with the current standard of care in our internal U.S. population and external Greek validation cohort, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first unified, personalized prescription strategy for THV selection in TAVR.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and transformer architectures have shown impressive reasoning and generation capabilities across diverse natural language tasks. However, their reliability and robustness in real-world engineering domains remain largely unexplored, limiting their practical utility in human-centric workflows. In this work, we investigate the applicability and consistency of LLMs for analog circuit design -- a task requiring domain-specific reasoning, adherence to physical constraints, and structured representations -- focusing on AI-assisted design where humans remain in the loop. We study how different data representations influence model behavior and compare smaller models (e.g., T5, GPT-2) with larger foundation models (e.g., Mistral-7B, GPT-oss-20B) under varying training conditions. Our results highlight key reliability challenges, including sensitivity to data format, instability in generated designs, and limited generalization to unseen circuit configurations. These findings provide early evidence on the limits and potential of LLMs as tools to enhance human capabilities in complex engineering tasks, offering insights into designing reliable, deployable foundation models for structured, real-world applications.

Abstract: Contrastive learning methods enforce label distance relationships in feature space to improve representation capability for regression models. However, these methods highly depend on label information to correctly recover ordinal relationships of features, limiting their applications to semi-supervised regression. In this work, we extend contrastive regression methods to allow unlabeled data to be used in the semi-supervised setting, thereby reducing the dependence on costly annotations. Particularly we construct the feature similarity matrix with both labeled and unlabeled samples in a mini-batch to reflect inter-sample relationships, and an accurate ordinal ranking of involved unlabeled samples can be recovered through spectral seriation algorithms if the level of error is within certain bounds. The introduction of labeled samples above provides regularization of the ordinal ranking with guidance from the ground-truth label information, making the ranking more reliable. To reduce feature perturbations, we further utilize the dynamic programming algorithm to select robust features for the matrix construction. The recovered ordinal relationship is then used for contrastive learning on unlabeled samples, and we thus allow more data to be used for feature representation learning, thereby achieving more robust results. The ordinal rankings can also be used to supervise predictions on unlabeled samples, serving as an additional training signal. We provide theoretical guarantees and empirical verification through experiments on various datasets, demonstrating that our method can surpass existing state-of-the-art semi-supervised deep regression methods. Our code have been released on https://github.com/xmed-lab/CLSS.

Abstract: Inferring the eventual goal of a mobile agent from noisy observations of its trajectory is a fundamental estimation problem. We initiate the study of such intent inference using a variant of a Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter (RBPF), subject to the assumption that the agent's intent manifests through closed-loop behavior with a state-of-the-art provable practical stability property. Leveraging the assumed closed-form agent dynamics, the RBPF analytically marginalizes the linear-Gaussian substructure and updates particle weights only, improving sample efficiency over a standard particle filter. Two difference estimators are introduced: a Gaussian mixture model using the RBPF weights and a reduced version confining the mixture to the effective sample. We quantify how well the adversary can recover the agent's intent using information-theoretic leakage metrics and provide computable lower bounds on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the true intent distribution and RBPF estimates via Gaussian-mixture KL bounds. We also provide a bound on the difference in performance between the two estimators, highlighting the fact that the reduced estimator performs almost as well as the complete one. Experiments illustrate fast and accurate intent recovery for compliant agents, motivating future work on designing intent-obfuscating controllers.

Abstract: Self supervised learning (SSL) is a machine learning paradigm where models learn to understand the underlying structure of data without explicit supervision from labeled samples. The acquired representations from SSL have demonstrated useful for many downstream tasks including clustering, and linear classification, etc. To ensure smoothness of the representation space, most SSL methods rely on the ability to generate pairs of observations that are similar to a given instance. However, generating these pairs may be challenging for many types of data. Moreover, these methods lack consideration of uncertainty quantification and can perform poorly in out-of-sample prediction settings. To address these limitations, we propose Gaussian process self supervised learning (GPSSL), a novel approach that utilizes Gaussian processes (GP) models on representation learning. GP priors are imposed on the representations, and we obtain a generalized Bayesian posterior minimizing a loss function that encourages informative representations. The covariance function inherent in GPs naturally pulls representations of similar units together, serving as an alternative to using explicitly defined positive samples. We show that GPSSL is closely related to both kernel PCA and VICReg, a popular neural network-based SSL method, but unlike both allows for posterior uncertainties that can be propagated to downstream tasks. Experiments on various datasets, considering classification and regression tasks, demonstrate that GPSSL outperforms traditional methods in terms of accuracy, uncertainty quantification, and error control.

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a standard approach for adapting large language models to specialized domains, yet its application to protein sequence modeling and protein language models (PLMs) remains ad hoc. This is in part because high-quality annotated data are far more difficult to obtain for proteins than for natural language. We present a simple and general recipe for fast SFT of PLMs, designed to improve the fidelity, reliability, and novelty of generated protein sequences. Unlike existing approaches that require costly precompiled experimental datasets for SFT, our method leverages the PLM itself, integrating a lightweight curation pipeline with domain-specific filters to construct high-quality training data. These filters can independently refine a PLM's output and identify candidates for in vitro evaluation; when combined with SFT, they enable PLMs to generate more stable and functional enzymes, while expanding exploration into protein sequence space beyond natural variants. Although our approach is agnostic to both the choice of protein language model (PLM) and the protein system, we demonstrate its effectiveness with a genome-scale PLM (GenSLM) applied to the tryptophan synthase enzyme family. The supervised fine-tuned model generates sequences that are not only more novel but also display improved characteristics across both targeted design constraints and emergent protein property measures.

Abstract: This paper presents an improved physics-driven neural network (IPDNN) framework for solving electromagnetic inverse scattering problems (ISPs). A new Gaussian-localized oscillation-suppressing window (GLOW) activation function is introduced to stabilize convergence and enable a lightweight yet accurate network architecture. A dynamic scatter subregion identification strategy is further developed to adaptively refine the computational domain, preventing missed detections and reducing computational cost. Moreover, transfer learning is incorporated to extend the solver's applicability to practical scenarios, integrating the physical interpretability of iterative algorithms with the real-time inference capability of neural networks. Numerical simulations and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solver achieves superior reconstruction accuracy, robustness, and efficiency compared with existing state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: The persistent volatility of construction material prices poses significant risks to cost estimation, budgeting, and project delivery, underscoring the urgent need for granular and scalable forecasting methods. This study develops a forecasting framework that leverages the Construction Specifications Institute (CSI) MasterFormat as the target data structure, enabling predictions at the six-digit section level and supporting detailed cost projections across a wide spectrum of building materials. To enhance predictive accuracy, the framework integrates explanatory variables such as raw material prices, commodity indexes, and macroeconomic indicators. Four time-series models, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), and Chronos-Bolt, were evaluated under both baseline configurations (using CSI data only) and extended versions with explanatory variables. Results demonstrate that incorporating explanatory variables significantly improves predictive performance across all models. Among the tested approaches, the LSTM model consistently achieved the highest accuracy, with RMSE values as low as 1.390 and MAPE values of 0.957, representing improvements of up to 59\% over the traditional statistical time-series model, ARIMA. Validation across multiple CSI divisions confirmed the framework's scalability, while Division 06 (Wood, Plastics, and Composites) is presented in detail as a demonstration case. This research offers a robust methodology that enables owners and contractors to improve budgeting practices and achieve more reliable cost estimation at the Definitive level.

Abstract: Predicting molecule-protein interactions (MPIs) is a fundamental task in computational biology, with crucial applications in drug discovery and molecular function annotation. However, existing MPI models face two major challenges. First, the scarcity of labeled molecule-protein pairs significantly limits model performance, as available datasets capture only a small fraction of biological relevant interactions. Second, most methods rely solely on molecular and protein features, ignoring broader biological context such as genes, metabolic pathways, and functional annotations that could provide essential complementary information. To address these limitations, our framework first aggregates diverse biological datasets, including molecular, protein, genes and pathway-level interactions, and then develop an optimal transport-based approach to generate high-quality pseudo-labels for unlabeled molecule-protein pairs, leveraging the underlying distribution of known interactions to guide label assignment. By treating pseudo-labeling as a mechanism for bridging disparate biological modalities, our approach enables the effective use of heterogeneous data to enhance MPI prediction. We evaluate our framework on multiple MPI datasets including virtual screening tasks and protein retrieval tasks, demonstrating substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracies and zero shot ability across unseen interactions. Beyond MPI prediction, our approach provides a new paradigm for leveraging diverse biological data sources to tackle problems traditionally constrained by single- or bi-modal learning, paving the way for future advances in computational biology and drug discovery.

Abstract: Traffic accidents result in millions of injuries and fatalities globally, with a significant number occurring at intersections each year. Traffic Signal Control (TSC) is an effective strategy for enhancing safety at these urban junctures. Despite the growing popularity of Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods in optimizing TSC, these methods often prioritize driving efficiency over safety, thus failing to address the critical balance between these two aspects. Additionally, these methods usually need more interpretability. CounterFactual (CF) learning is a promising approach for various causal analysis fields. In this study, we introduce a novel framework to improve RL for safety aspects in TSC. This framework introduces a novel method based on CF learning to address the question: ``What if, when an unsafe event occurs, we backtrack to perform alternative actions, and will this unsafe event still occur in the subsequent period?'' To answer this question, we propose a new structure causal model to predict the result after executing different actions, and we propose a new CF module that integrates with additional ``X'' modules to promote safe RL practices. Our new algorithm, CFLight, which is derived from this framework, effectively tackles challenging safety events and significantly improves safety at intersections through a near-zero collision control strategy. Through extensive numerical experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets, we demonstrate that CFLight reduces collisions and improves overall traffic performance compared to conventional RL methods and the recent safe RL model. Moreover, our method represents a generalized and safe framework for RL methods, opening possibilities for applications in other domains. The data and code are available in the github https://github.com/MJLee00/CFLight-Enhancing-Safety-with-Traffic-Signal-Control-through-Counterfactual-Learning.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled strong reasoning over both structured and unstructured knowledge. When grounded on knowledge graphs (KGs), however, prevailing pipelines rely on heavy neural encoders to embed and score symbolic paths or on repeated LLM calls to rank candidates, leading to high latency, GPU cost, and opaque decisions that hinder faithful, scalable deployment. We propose PathHD, a lightweight and encoder-free KG reasoning framework that replaces neural path scoring with hyperdimensional computing (HDC) and uses only a single LLM call per query. PathHD encodes relation paths into block-diagonal GHRR hypervectors, ranks candidates with blockwise cosine similarity and Top-K pruning, and then performs a one-shot LLM adjudication to produce the final answer together with cited supporting paths. Technically, PathHD is built on three ingredients: (i) an order-aware, non-commutative binding operator for path composition, (ii) a calibrated similarity for robust hypervector-based retrieval, and (iii) a one-shot adjudication step that preserves interpretability while eliminating per-path LLM scoring. On WebQSP, CWQ, and the GrailQA split, PathHD (i) attains comparable or better Hits@1 than strong neural baselines while using one LLM call per query; (ii) reduces end-to-end latency by $40-60\%$ and GPU memory by $3-5\times$ thanks to encoder-free retrieval; and (iii) delivers faithful, path-grounded rationales that improve error diagnosis and controllability. These results indicate that carefully designed HDC representations provide a practical substrate for efficient KG-LLM reasoning, offering a favorable accuracy-efficiency-interpretability trade-off.

Motivation: 车辆边缘缓存能通过预缓存感兴趣内容降低延迟，但传统联邦学习（FL）存在频繁模型传输带来的通信开销大、车辆可能离开RSU覆盖区域导致训练失败的问题。因此需要一种更高效且保护隐私的缓存方案。

Result: 仿真结果显示，该方案对车速变化具有良好鲁棒性，显著降低了通信开销，并提高了缓存命中百分比。

Conclusion: 提出的基于LDPM的联邦蒸馏辅助车辆边缘缓存方案有效解决了传统FL的通信开销和训练失败问题，在保护隐私的同时提升了缓存性能。

Abstract: Vehicle edge caching is a promising technology that can significantly reduce the latency for vehicle users (VUs) to access content by pre-caching user-interested content at edge nodes. It is crucial to accurately predict the content that VUs are interested in without exposing their privacy. Traditional federated learning (FL) can protect user privacy by sharing models rather than raw data. However, the training of FL requires frequent model transmission, which can result in significant communication overhead. Additionally, vehicles may leave the road side unit (RSU) coverage area before training is completed, leading to training failures. To address these issues, in this letter, we propose a federated distillation-assisted vehicle edge caching scheme based on lightweight denoising diffusion probabilistic model (LDPM). The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed vehicle edge caching scheme has good robustness to variations in vehicle speed, significantly reducing communication overhead and improving cache hit percentage.

Abstract: Traffic prediction remains a key challenge in spatio-temporal data mining, despite progress in deep learning. Accurate forecasting is hindered by the complex influence of external factors such as traffic accidents and regulations, often overlooked by existing models due to limited data integration. To address these limitations, we present two enriched traffic datasets from Tokyo and California, incorporating traffic accident and regulation data. Leveraging these datasets, we propose ConFormer (Conditional Transformer), a novel framework that integrates graph propagation with guided normalization layer. This design dynamically adjusts spatial and temporal node relationships based on historical patterns, enhancing predictive accuracy. Our model surpasses the state-of-the-art STAEFormer in both predictive performance and efficiency, achieving lower computational costs and reduced parameter demands. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ConFormer consistently outperforms mainstream spatio-temporal baselines across multiple metrics, underscoring its potential to advance traffic prediction research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于柯西-施瓦茨散度的新型公平性正则化器（CS regularizer），用于提升机器学习模型在不同敏感属性组间的公平性表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平性正则化器基于不同的距离度量和设计选择，导致其行为难以理解且在不同任务上表现不稳定。需要探究公平性正则化器的理想特性，并设计一个既具有理论保障又实用的正则化器。

Method: 通过将现有方法归纳为三类（匹配预测统计、对齐潜在表示、最小化预测与敏感属性间依赖关系），提出理想的统计距离特征。基于这些特征，提出采用柯西-施瓦茨散度（CS divergence）作为公平性正则化器，惩罚不同敏感属性组条件预测分布之间的差异。该估计器适用于分布无关设置并通过核方法扩展到多敏感属性场景。

Result: 在高斯假设下，CS散度相比KL散度、最大均值差异（MMD）和人口统计学公平性（Demographic Parity）中的平均差异具有更紧的理论界限。在四个表格数据集和一个图像数据集上的实验表明，CS正则化器能持续改进人口统计学公平性和机会均等性指标，同时保持竞争力准确率，并在超参数设置下展现出更稳定的效用-公平性权衡。

Conclusion: CS公平性正则化器通过理论严谨的距离度量和灵活的核方法实现，为机器学习模型提供了一种更可靠、更稳定的组公平性增强方法，同时保持良好的预测性能。它在理论界限的紧致性和对多敏感属性的扩展性方面优于已有方法。

Abstract: Group fairness in machine learning is often enforced by adding a regularizer that reduces the dependence between model predictions and sensitive attributes. However, existing regularizers are built on heterogeneous distance measures and design choices, which makes their behavior hard to reason about and their performance inconsistent across tasks. This raises a basic question: what properties make a good fairness regularizer? We address this question by first organizing existing in-process methods into three families: (i) matching prediction statistics across sensitive groups, (ii) aligning latent representations, and (iii) directly minimizing dependence between predictions and sensitive attributes. Through this lens, we identify desirable properties of the underlying distance measure, including tight generalization bounds, robustness to scale differences, and the ability to handle arbitrary prediction distributions. Motivated by these properties, we propose a Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) fairness regularizer that penalizes the empirical CS divergence between prediction distributions conditioned on sensitive groups. Under a Gaussian comparison, we show that CS divergence yields a tighter bound than Kullback-Leibler divergence, Maximum Mean Discrepancy, and the mean disparity used in Demographic Parity, and we discuss how these advantages translate to a distribution-free, kernel-based estimator that naturally extends to multiple sensitive attributes. Extensive experiments on four tabular benchmarks and one image dataset demonstrate that the proposed CS regularizer consistently improves Demographic Parity and Equal Opportunity metrics while maintaining competitive accuracy, and achieves a more stable utility-fairness trade-off across hyperparameter settings compared to prior regularizers.

Abstract: Unequal representation of demographic groups in training data poses challenges to model generalisation across populations. Standard practice assumes that balancing subgroup representation optimises performance. However, recent empirical results contradict this assumption: in some cases, imbalanced data distributions actually improve subgroup performance, while in others, subgroup performance remains unaffected by the absence of an entire subgroup during training. We conduct a systematic study of subgroup allocation across four vision and language models, varying training data composition to characterise the sensitivity of subgroup performance to data balance. We propose the latent separation hypothesis, which states that a partially fine-tuned model's dependence on subgroup representation is determined by the degree of separation between subgroups in the latent space of the pre-trained model. We formalise this hypothesis, provide theoretical analysis, and validate it empirically. Finally, we present a practical application to foundation model fine-tuning, demonstrating that quantitative analysis of latent subgroup separation can inform data collection and balancing decisions.

Abstract: We initiate the study of contextual dynamic pricing with a heterogeneous population of buyers, where a seller repeatedly posts prices (over $T$ rounds) that depend on the observable $d$-dimensional context and receives binary purchase feedback. Unlike prior work assuming homogeneous buyer types, in our setting the buyer's valuation type is drawn from an unknown distribution with finite support size $K_{\star}$. We develop a contextual pricing algorithm based on optimistic posterior sampling with regret $\widetilde{O}(K_{\star}\sqrt{dT})$, which we prove to be tight in $d$ and $T$ up to logarithmic terms. Finally, we refine our analysis for the non-contextual pricing case, proposing a variance-aware zooming algorithm that achieves the optimal dependence on $K_{\star}$.

Abstract: This study presents QuanvNeXt, an end-to-end fully quanvolutional model for EEG-based depression diagnosis. QuanvNeXt incorporates a novel Cross Residual block, which reduces feature homogeneity and strengthens cross-feature relationships while retaining parameter efficiency. We evaluated QuanvNeXt on two open-source datasets, where it achieved an average accuracy of 93.1% and an average AUC-ROC of 97.2%, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines such as InceptionTime (91.7% accuracy, 95.9% AUC-ROC). An uncertainty analysis across Gaussian noise levels demonstrated well-calibrated predictions, with ECE scores remaining low (0.0436, Dataset 1) to moderate (0.1159, Dataset 2) even at the highest perturbation (ε = 0.1). Additionally, a post-hoc explainable AI analysis confirmed that QuanvNeXt effectively identifies and learns spectrotemporal patterns that distinguish between healthy controls and major depressive disorder. Overall, QuanvNeXt establishes an efficient and reliable approach for EEG-based depression diagnosis.

Abstract: We investigate a fully Latent AutoRegressive scheme based on a Gaussian Process (GP) integrated into a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). In this setting, sequential dynamics are transferred from the observation space to a continuous latent space, while linguistic generation remains parallel through a non-autoregressive decoder. We present a complete methodological formulation, including a causal GP prior, a structured amortized posterior, and a training protocol based on a regularized ELBO. Empirical evaluation, conducted within a deliberately constrained proof-of-concept (POC) framework, shows that the model can be trained stably and that the sequential and parallel sampling variants exhibit consistent behavior. Overall, the results suggest that part of the temporal structure in a language model can be supported by the probabilistic geometry of the latent space rather than by explicit neural operations.

Abstract: Polysomnography (PSG), the gold standard test for sleep analysis, generates vast amounts of multimodal clinical data, presenting an opportunity to leverage self-supervised representation learning (SSRL) for pre-training foundation models to enhance sleep analysis. However, progress in sleep foundation models is hindered by two key limitations: (1) the lack of a shared dataset and benchmark with diverse tasks for training and evaluation, and (2) the absence of a systematic evaluation of SSRL approaches across sleep-related tasks. To address these gaps, we introduce Stanford Sleep Bench, a large-scale PSG dataset comprising 17,467 recordings totaling over 163,000 hours from a major sleep clinic, including 13 clinical disease prediction tasks alongside canonical sleep-related tasks such as sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, and age estimation. We systematically evaluate SSRL pre-training methods on Stanford Sleep Bench, assessing downstream performance across four tasks: sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, age estimation, and disease and mortality prediction. Our results show that multiple pretraining methods achieve comparable performance for sleep staging, apnea diagnosis, and age estimation. However, for mortality and disease prediction, contrastive learning significantly outperforms other approaches while also converging faster during pretraining. To facilitate reproducibility and advance sleep research, we will release Stanford Sleep Bench along with pretrained model weights, training pipelines, and evaluation code.

Abstract: Semantic Communication (SC) combined with Vehicular edge computing (VEC) provides an efficient edge task processing paradigm for Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Focusing on highway scenarios, this paper proposes a Tripartite Cooperative Semantic Communication (TCSC) framework, which enables Vehicle Users (VUs) to perform semantic task offloading via Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) and Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications. Considering task latency and the number of semantic symbols, the framework constructs a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problem, which is transformed into two subproblems. First, we innovatively propose a multi-agent proximal policy optimization task offloading optimization method based on parametric distribution noise (MAPPO-PDN) to solve the optimization problem of the number of semantic symbols; second, linear programming (LP) is used to solve offloading ratio. Simulations show that performance of this scheme is superior to that of other algorithms.

Abstract: Generative audio models, based on diffusion and autoregressive architectures, have advanced rapidly in both quality and expressiveness. This progress, however, raises pressing copyright concerns, as such models are often trained on vast corpora of artistic and commercial works. A central question is whether one can reliably verify if an artist's material was included in training, thereby providing a means for copyright holders to protect their content. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of such verification through membership inference attacks (MIA) on open-source generative audio models, which attempt to determine whether a specific audio sample was part of the training set. Our empirical results show that membership inference alone is of limited effectiveness at scale, as the per-sample membership signal is weak for models trained on large and diverse datasets. However, artists and media owners typically hold collections of works rather than isolated samples. Building on prior work in text and vision domains, in this work we focus on dataset inference (DI), which aggregates diverse membership evidence across multiple samples. We find that DI is successful in the audio domain, offering a more practical mechanism for assessing whether an artist's works contributed to model training. Our results suggest DI as a promising direction for copyright protection and dataset accountability in the era of large audio generative models.

Abstract: Equivariant neural networks encode symmetry as an inductive bias and have achieved strong empirical performance in wide domains. However, their expressive power remains not well understood. Focusing on 2-layer ReLU networks, this paper investigates the impact of equivariance constraints on the expressivity of equivariant and layer-wise equivariant networks. By examining the boundary hyperplanes and the channel vectors of ReLU networks, we construct an example showing that equivariance constraints could strictly limit expressive power. However, we demonstrate that this drawback can be compensated via enlarging the model size. Furthermore, we show that despite a larger model size, the resulting architecture could still correspond to a hypothesis space with lower complexity, implying superior generalizability for equivariant networks.

Abstract: The growing adoption of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies enables automated, real-time collection of manufacturing process data, unlocking new opportunities for data-driven product development. Current data-driven methods are generally applied within specific domains, such as design or manufacturing, with limited exploration of integrating design features and manufacturing process data. Since design decisions significantly affect manufacturing outcomes, such as error rates, energy consumption, and processing times, the lack of such integration restricts the potential for data-driven product design improvements. This paper presents a data-driven approach to mapping and analyzing the relationship between design features and manufacturing process data. A comprehensive system architecture is developed to ensure continuous data collection and integration. The linkage between design features and manufacturing process data serves as the basis for developing a machine learning model that enables automated design improvement suggestions. By integrating manufacturing process data with sustainability metrics, this approach opens new possibilities for sustainable product development.

Abstract: The paradigm of agentic AI is shifting from engineered complex workflows to post-training native models. However, existing agents are typically confined to static, predefined action spaces--such as exclusively using APIs, GUI events, or robotic commands. This rigidity limits their adaptability in dynamic environments where the optimal granularity of interaction varies contextually. To bridge this gap, we propose CrossAgent, a unified agentic model that masters heterogeneous action spaces and autonomously selects the most effective interface for each step of a trajectory. We introduce a comprehensive training pipeline that integrates cold-start supervised fine-tuning with a Multi-Turn Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm. This approach enables the agent to learn adaptive action switching--balancing high-level efficiency with low-level precision--without human-specified rules. Extensive experiments on over 800 tasks in the open-world Minecraft environment demonstrate that CrossAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance. By dynamically leveraging the strengths of diverse action spaces, our model significantly outperforms fixed-action baselines, exhibiting superior generalization and efficiency in long-horizon reasoning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent research has developed several LLM architectures suitable for inference on end-user devices, such as the Mixture of Lookup Experts (MoLE)~\parencite{jie_mixture_2025}. A key feature of MoLE is that each token id is associated with a dedicated group of experts. For a given input, only the experts corresponding to the input token id will be activated. Since the communication overhead of loading this small number of activated experts into RAM during inference is negligible, expert parameters can be offloaded to storage, making MoLE suitable for resource-constrained devices. However, MoLE's context-independent expert selection mechanism, based solely on input ids, may limit model performance. To address this, we propose the \textbf{M}ixture \textbf{o}f \textbf{L}ookup \textbf{K}ey-\textbf{V}alue Experts (\textbf{MoLKV}) model. In MoLKV, each expert is structured as a key-value pair. For a given input, the input-derived query interacts with the cached key-value experts from the current sequence, generating a context-aware expert output. This context-aware mechanism alleviates the limitation of MoLE, and experimental results demonstrate that MoLKV achieves significantly lower validation loss in small-scale evaluations.

Abstract: Transformers generate valid and diverse chemical structures, but little is known about the mechanisms that enable these models to capture the rules of molecular representation. We present a mechanistic analysis of autoregressive transformers trained on drug-like small molecules to reveal the computational structure underlying their capabilities across multiple levels of abstraction. We identify computational patterns consistent with low-level syntactic parsing and more abstract chemical validity constraints. Using sparse autoencoders (SAEs), we extract feature dictionaries associated with chemically relevant activation patterns. We validate our findings on downstream tasks and find that mechanistic insights can translate to predictive performance in various practical settings.

Abstract: Battery energy storage systems (BESS) have become increasingly vital in three-phase unbalanced distribution grids for maintaining voltage stability and enabling optimal dispatch. However, existing deep learning approaches often lack explicit three-phase representation, making it difficult to accurately model phase-specific dynamics and enforce operational constraints--leading to infeasible dispatch solutions. This paper demonstrates that by embedding detailed three-phase grid information--including phase voltages, unbalanced loads, and BESS states--into heterogeneous graph nodes, diverse GNN architectures (GCN, GAT, GraphSAGE, GPS) can jointly predict network state variables with high accuracy. Moreover, a physics-informed loss function incorporates critical battery constraints--SoC and C-rate limits--via soft penalties during training. Experimental validation on the CIGRE 18-bus distribution system shows that this embedding-loss approach achieves low prediction errors, with bus voltage MSEs of 6.92e-07 (GCN), 1.21e-06 (GAT), 3.29e-05 (GPS), and 9.04e-07 (SAGE). Importantly, the physics-informed method ensures nearly zero SoC and C-rate constraint violations, confirming its effectiveness for reliable, constraint-compliant dispatch.

Abstract: Always-on sensors are increasingly expected to embark a variety of tiny neural networks and to continuously perform inference on time-series of the data they sense. In order to fit lifetime and energy consumption requirements when operating on battery, such hardware uses microcontrollers (MCUs) with tiny memory budget e.g., 128kB of RAM. In this context, optimizing data flows across neural network layers becomes crucial. In this paper, we introduce TinyDéjàVu, a new framework and novel algorithms we designed to drastically reduce the RAM footprint required by inference using various tiny ML models for sensor data time-series on typical microcontroller hardware. We publish the implementation of TinyDéjàVu as open source, and we perform reproducible benchmarks on hardware. We show that TinyDéjàVu can save more than 60% of RAM usage and eliminate up to 90% of redundant compute on overlapping sliding window inputs.

TL;DR: DivMorph是一种模块化训练范式，通过知识分流学习可分解的控制器，提升跨异构智能体形态和任务泛化能力，显著提升样本效率并减少模型规模


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的通用形态控制方法计算成本高，部署开销大，且跨任务泛化能力有限，需要为每个新任务从头训练

Method: 通过SVD将随机初始化的Transformer权重分解为因子单元，使用动态软门控根据任务和形态嵌入调制这些单元，分离为共享的learn genes和特定于形态/任务的tailors

Result: DivMorph达到最先进性能，在跨任务迁移中样本效率比直接微调提升3倍，单个智能体部署时模型规模减少17倍

Conclusion: DivMorph通过知识分流的模块化设计实现了高效、可扩展的策略部署和有效的策略迁移到新任务

Abstract: Universal morphology control aims to learn a universal policy that generalizes across heterogeneous agent morphologies, with Transformer-based controllers emerging as a popular choice. However, such architectures incur substantial computational costs, resulting in high deployment overhead, and existing methods exhibit limited cross-task generalization, necessitating training from scratch for each new task. To this end, we propose \textbf{DivMorph}, a modular training paradigm that leverages knowledge diversion to learn decomposable controllers. DivMorph factorizes randomly initialized Transformer weights into factor units via SVD prior to training and employs dynamic soft gating to modulate these units based on task and morphology embeddings, separating them into shared \textit{learngenes} and morphology- and task-specific \textit{tailors}, thereby achieving knowledge disentanglement. By selectively activating relevant components, DivMorph enables scalable and efficient policy deployment while supporting effective policy transfer to novel tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DivMorph achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 3$\times$ improvement in sample efficiency over direct finetuning for cross-task transfer and a 17$\times$ reduction in model size for single-agent deployment.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了Ariel-ML，一个用于在多核微控制器上自动化并行化TinyML模型推理的Rust嵌入式软件平台


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低功耗微控制器正从单核转向多核架构，嵌入式软件越来越多使用Rust编写，同时TinyML模型在边缘AI应用中的部署日益增多。然而，目前缺乏能够自动化并行化推理计算的Rust嵌入式平台

Method: 设计Ariel-ML工具包，结合通用TinyML流程和嵌入式Rust软件平台，充分利用各种32位微控制器（Arm Cortex-M、RISC-V、ESP-32）的多核能力

Result: Ariel-ML在推理延迟方面优于现有技术，与使用嵌入式C/C++的现有工具包相比，实现了相当的内存占用。开源实现并提供了各种TinyML模型的基准测试

Conclusion: Ariel-ML为TinyML从业者和资源受限的嵌入式Rust开发人员提供了有用的基础

Abstract: Low-power microcontroller (MCU) hardware is currently evolving from single-core architectures to predominantly multi-core architectures. In parallel, new embedded software building blocks are more and more written in Rust, while C/C++ dominance fades in this domain. On the other hand, small artificial neural networks (ANN) of various kinds are increasingly deployed in edge AI use cases, thus deployed and executed directly on low-power MCUs. In this context, both incremental improvements and novel innovative services will have to be continuously retrofitted using ANNs execution in software embedded on sensing/actuating systems already deployed in the field. However, there was so far no Rust embedded software platform automating parallelization for inference computation on multi-core MCUs executing arbitrary TinyML models. This paper thus fills this gap by introducing Ariel-ML, a novel toolkit we designed combining a generic TinyML pipeline and an embedded Rust software platform which can take full advantage of multi-core capabilities of various 32bit microcontroller families (Arm Cortex-M, RISC-V, ESP-32). We published the full open source code of its implementation, which we used to benchmark its capabilities using a zoo of various TinyML models. We show that Ariel-ML outperforms prior art in terms of inference latency as expected, and we show that, compared to pre-existing toolkits using embedded C/C++, Ariel-ML achieves comparable memory footprints. Ariel-ML thus provides a useful basis for TinyML practitioners and resource-constrained embedded Rust developers.

Abstract: Graph clustering plays a pivotal role in unsupervised learning methods like spectral clustering, yet traditional methods for graph clustering often perpetuate bias through unfair graph constructions that may underrepresent some groups. The current research introduces novel approaches for constructing fair k-nearest neighbor (kNN) and fair epsilon-neighborhood graphs that proactively enforce demographic parity during graph formation. By incorporating fairness constraints at the earliest stage of neighborhood selection steps, our approaches incorporate proportional representation of sensitive features into the local graph structure while maintaining geometric consistency.Our work addresses a critical gap in pre-processing for fair spectral clustering, demonstrating that topological fairness in graph construction is essential for achieving equitable clustering outcomes. Widely used graph construction methods like kNN and epsilon-neighborhood graphs propagate edge based disparate impact on sensitive groups, leading to biased clustering results. Providing representation of each sensitive group in the neighborhood of every node leads to fairer spectral clustering results because the topological features of the graph naturally reflect equitable group ratios. This research fills an essential shortcoming in fair unsupervised learning, by illustrating how topological fairness in graph construction inherently facilitates fairer spectral clustering results without the need for changes to the clustering algorithm itself. Thorough experiments on three synthetic datasets, seven real-world tabular datasets, and three real-world image datasets prove that our fair graph construction methods surpass the current baselines in graph clustering tasks.

Abstract: California's wildfire season keeps getting worse over the years, overwhelming the emergency response teams. These fires cause massive destruction to both property and human life. Because of these reasons, there's a growing need for accurate and practical predictions that can help assist with resources allocation for the Wildfire managers or the response teams. In this research, we built machine learning models to predict the number of days it will require to fully contain a wildfire in California. Here, we addressed an important gap in the current literature. Most prior research has concentrated on wildfire risk or how fires spread, and the few that examine the duration typically predict it in broader categories rather than a continuous measure. This research treats the wildfire duration prediction as a regression task, which allows for more detailed and precise forecasts rather than just the broader categorical predictions used in prior work. We built the models by combining three publicly available datasets from California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection's Fire and Resource Assessment Program (FRAP). This study compared the performance of baseline ensemble regressor, Random Forest and XGBoost, with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. The results show that the XGBoost model slightly outperforms the Random Forest model, likely due to its superior handling of static features in the dataset. The LSTM model, on the other hand, performed worse than the ensemble models because the dataset lacked temporal features. Overall, this study shows that, depending on the feature availability, Wildfire managers or Fire management authorities can select the most appropriate model to accurately predict wildfire containment duration and allocate resources effectively.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce Conformal Bandits, a novel framework integrating Conformal Prediction (CP) into bandit problems, a classic paradigm for sequential decision-making under uncertainty. Traditional regret-minimisation bandit strategies like Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) typically rely on distributional assumptions or asymptotic guarantees; further, they remain largely focused on regret, neglecting their statistical properties. We address this gap. Through the adoption of CP, we bridge the regret-minimising potential of a decision-making bandit policy with statistical guarantees in the form of finite-time prediction coverage.
  We demonstrate the potential of it Conformal Bandits through simulation studies and an application to portfolio allocation, a typical small-gap regime, where differences in arm rewards are far too small for classical policies to achieve optimal regret bounds in finite sample. Motivated by this, we showcase our framework's practical advantage in terms of regret in small-gap settings, as well as its added value in achieving nominal coverage guarantees where classical UCB policies fail. Focusing on our application of interest, we further illustrate how integrating hidden Markov models to capture the regime-switching behaviour of financial markets, enhances the exploration-exploitation trade-off, and translates into higher risk-adjusted regret efficiency returns, while preserving coverage guarantees.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识蒸馏（KD）虽然是一种有效模型压缩技术，但存在以下关键限制：（1）对超参数敏感，需要大量手动调整；（2）当教师模型非常大、学生模型非常小时，存在容量差距；（3）在多教师场景中协调不佳；（4）计算资源使用效率低。因此，需要一种能够自动调参、处理容量差距、有效集成多教师知识并提升计算效率的新型框架：HPM-KD。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as a promising technique for model compression but faces critical limitations: (1) sensitivity to hyperparameters requiring extensive manual tuning, (2) capacity gap when distilling from very large teachers to small students, (3) suboptimal coordination in multi-teacher scenarios, and (4) inefficient use of computational resources. We present \textbf{HPM-KD}, a framework that integrates six synergistic components: (i) Adaptive Configuration Manager via meta-learning that eliminates manual hyperparameter tuning, (ii) Progressive Distillation Chain with automatically determined intermediate models, (iii) Attention-Weighted Multi-Teacher Ensemble that learns dynamic per-sample weights, (iv) Meta-Learned Temperature Scheduler that adapts temperature throughout training, (v) Parallel Processing Pipeline with intelligent load balancing, and (vi) Shared Optimization Memory for cross-experiment reuse. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and tabular datasets demonstrate that HPM-KD: achieves 10x-15x compression while maintaining 85% accuracy retention, eliminates the need for manual tuning, and reduces training time by 30-40% via parallelization. Ablation studies confirm independent contribution of each component (0.10-0.98 pp). HPM-KD is available as part of the open-source DeepBridge library.

Abstract: We analyze the distinctions between two functionals often used as over-smoothing measures: the Dirichlet energies induced by the unnormalized graph Laplacian and the normalized graph Laplacian. We demonstrate that the latter fails to satisfy the axiomatic definition of a node-similarity measure proposed by Rusch \textit{et al.} By formalizing fundamental spectral properties of these two definitions, we highlight critical distinctions necessary to select the metric that is spectrally compatible with the GNN architecture, thereby resolving ambiguities in monitoring the dynamics.

Conclusion: 研究表明，现代语言模型的经验观察特性（近似低logit秩结构）可以在算法上被利用，为实际API访问模型中的学习提供理论保证，这对理解语言模型的可学习性具有重要意义。

Abstract: While modern language models and their inner workings are incredibly complex, recent work (Golowich, Liu & Shetty; 2025) has proposed a simple and potentially tractable abstraction for them through the observation that empirically, these language models all seem to have approximately low logit rank. Roughly, this means that a matrix formed by the model's log probabilities of various tokens conditioned on certain sequences of tokens is well approximated by a low rank matrix.
  In this paper, our focus is on understanding how this structure can be exploited algorithmically for obtaining provable learning guarantees. Since low logit rank models can encode hard-to-learn distributions such as noisy parities, we study a query learning model with logit queries that reflects the access model for common APIs. Our main result is an efficient algorithm for learning any approximately low logit rank model from queries. We emphasize that our structural assumption closely reflects the behavior that is empirically observed in modern language models. Thus, our result gives what we believe is the first end-to-end learning guarantee for a generative model that plausibly captures modern language models.

Abstract: Scalable sampling of molecular states in thermodynamic equilibrium is a long-standing challenge in statistical physics. Boltzmann Generators tackle this problem by pairing a generative model, capable of exact likelihood computation, with importance sampling to obtain consistent samples under the target distribution. Current Boltzmann Generators primarily use continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) trained with flow matching for efficient training of powerful models. However, likelihood calculation for these models is extremely costly, requiring thousands of function evaluations per sample, severely limiting their adoption. In this work, we propose Few-step Accurate Likelihoods for Continuous Flows (FALCON), a method which allows for few-step sampling with a likelihood accurate enough for importance sampling applications by introducing a hybrid training objective that encourages invertibility. We show FALCON outperforms state-of-the-art normalizing flow models for molecular Boltzmann sampling and is two orders of magnitude faster than the equivalently performing CNF model.

Abstract: World models paired with model predictive control (MPC) can be trained offline on large-scale datasets of expert trajectories and enable generalization to a wide range of planning tasks at inference time. Compared to traditional MPC procedures, which rely on slow search algorithms or on iteratively solving optimization problems exactly, gradient-based planning offers a computationally efficient alternative. However, the performance of gradient-based planning has thus far lagged behind that of other approaches. In this paper, we propose improved methods for training world models that enable efficient gradient-based planning. We begin with the observation that although a world model is trained on a next-state prediction objective, it is used at test-time to instead estimate a sequence of actions. The goal of our work is to close this train-test gap. To that end, we propose train-time data synthesis techniques that enable significantly improved gradient-based planning with existing world models. At test time, our approach outperforms or matches the classical gradient-free cross-entropy method (CEM) across a variety of object manipulation and navigation tasks in 10% of the time budget.

Abstract: High-Throughput Satellites (HTS) use beam hopping to handle non-uniform and time-varying ground traffic demand. A significant technical challenge in beam hopping is the computation of effective illumination patterns. Traditional algorithms, like the genetic algorithm, require over 300 seconds to compute a single illumination pattern for just 37 cells, whereas modern HTS typically covers over 300 cells, rendering current methods impractical for real-world applications. Advanced approaches, such as multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, face convergence issues when the number of cells exceeds 40. In this paper, we introduce Tyche, a hybrid computation framework designed to address this challenge. Tyche incorporates a Monte Carlo Tree Search Beam Hopping (MCTS-BH) algorithm for computing illumination patterns and employs sliding window and pruning techniques to significantly reduce computation time. Specifically, MCTS-BH can compute one illumination pattern for 37 cells in just 12 seconds. To ensure real-time computation, we use a Greedy Beam Hopping (G-BH) algorithm, which provides a provisional solution while MCTS-BH completes its computation in the background. Our evaluation results show that MCTS-BH can increase throughput by up to 98.76%, demonstrating substantial improvements over existing solutions.

Abstract: The rise of 5G/6G network technologies promises to enable applications like autonomous vehicles and virtual reality, resulting in a significant increase in connected devices and necessarily complicating network management. Even worse, these applications often have strict, yet heterogeneous, performance requirements across metrics like latency and reliability. Much recent work has thus focused on developing the ability to predict network performance. However, traditional methods for network modeling, like discrete event simulators and emulation, often fail to balance accuracy and scalability. Network Digital Twins (NDTs), augmented by machine learning, present a viable solution by creating virtual replicas of physical networks for real- time simulation and analysis. State-of-the-art models, however, fall short of full-fledged NDTs, as they often focus only on a single performance metric or simulated network data. We introduce M3Net, a Multi-Metric Mixture-of-experts (MoE) NDT that uses a graph neural network architecture to estimate multiple performance metrics from an expanded set of network state data in a range of scenarios. We show that M3Net significantly enhances the accuracy of flow delay predictions by reducing the MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) from 20.06% to 17.39%, while also achieving 66.47% and 78.7% accuracy on jitter and packets dropped for each flow

Abstract: This work introduces security for unsourced random access (URA) by employing wiretap-inspired physical layer techniques. To achieve confidentiality, the proposed system opportunistically exploits intrinsic features of feedback-aided URA without adding any overhead or altering its original structure or operational characteristics. As a result, the proposed system preserves the low-cost advantages of URA, including low delay and minimal signaling overhead, while providing secure communication. To secure transmission, each user generates a secret key and an artificial noise sequence from the feedback signal that the BS broadcasts in previous transmission rounds. This feedback depends on the BS-user channel, making it a private signal for each user. The secure transmission is performed by three actions: encrypting the data using the secret key, sending only the parity bits of the LDPC encoded secret key to allow the legitimate receiver to recover it, and masking these parity bits with the artificial noise. For reception, a receiver algorithm is designed for the legitimate user, and a leakage analysis is provided to quantify the information available to the eavesdropper. The simulation results show that meaningful secrecy is achieved in URA without modifying its structure and with negligible impact on standard performance.

Abstract: Blocking sets and minimal codes have been studied for many years in projective geometry and coding theory. In this paper, we provide a new lower bound on the size of $t$-fold $s$-blocking sets without the condition $t \leq q$, which is stronger than the classical result of Beutelspacher in 1983. Then a lower bound on lengths of projective $s$-minimal codes is also obtained. It is proved that $(s+1)$-minimal codes are certainly $s$-minimal codes. We generalize the Ashikhmin-Barg condition for minimal codes to $s$-minimal codes. Many infinite families of $s$-minimal codes satisfying and violating this generalized Ashikhmin-Barg condition are constructed. We also give several examples which are binary minimal codes, but not $2$-minimal codes.

Abstract: We solve, in the typical-case sense, the multi-sender linearly-decomposable distributed computing problem introduced by tessellated distributed computing. We model real-valued encoders/decoders and demand matrices, and assess structural fidelity via a thresholded graph edit distance between the demand support and the two-hop support of the computed product. Our analysis yields: a closed-form second-moment (Frobenius) risk under spike-and-slab ensembles; deterministic links between thresholded GED and norm error; a Gaussian surrogate with sub-exponential tails that exposes explicit recall lines; concentration of GED and operator-norm control; and a compute-capped design with a visible knee. We map the rules to aeronautical and satellite networks.

Abstract: Hallucinations are outputs by Large Language Models (LLMs) that are factually incorrect yet appear plausible [1]. This paper investigates how such hallucinations influence users' trust in LLMs and users' interaction with LLMs. To explore this in everyday use, we conducted a qualitative study with 192 participants. Our findings show that hallucinations do not result in blanket mistrust but instead lead to context-sensitive trust calibration. Building on the calibrated trust model by Lee & See [2] and Afroogh et al.'s trust-related factors [3], we confirm expectancy [3], [4], prior experience [3], [4], [5], and user expertise & domain knowledge [3], [4] as userrelated (human) trust factors, and identify intuition as an additional factor relevant for hallucination detection. Additionally, we found that trust dynamics are further influenced by contextual factors, particularly perceived risk [3] and decision stakes [6]. Consequently, we validate the recursive trust calibration process proposed by Blöbaum [7] and extend it by including intuition as a user-related trust factor. Based on these insights, we propose practical recommendations for responsible and reflective LLM use.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI治理框架无法有效应对实际部署挑战，导致风险评估不足、原则难以落地、规模化治理机制缺失等问题，需要通过更完善的框架来解决。

Method: 提出了AI TIPS 2.0（人工智能信任集成支柱可持续性框架），这是对2019年开发的全面操作框架的更新，旨在提供可操作的治理方案。

Result: 该框架直接解决了现有治理框架的三个关键挑战，提供了从用例风险评估到规模化实施的全流程解决方案。

Conclusion: AI TIPS 2.0为组织提供了系统化的AI治理框架，能够将信任原则转化为可操作的实践，支持从董事会到数据科学家的多层次治理需求。

Abstract: The deployment of AI systems faces three critical governance challenges that current frameworks fail to adequately address. First, organizations struggle with inadequate risk assessment at the use case level, exemplified by the Humana class action lawsuit and other high impact cases where an AI system deployed to production exhibited both significant bias and high error rates, resulting in improper healthcare claim denials. Each AI use case presents unique risk profiles requiring tailored governance, yet most frameworks provide one size fits all guidance. Second, existing frameworks like ISO 42001 and NIST AI RMF remain at high conceptual levels, offering principles without actionable controls, leaving practitioners unable to translate governance requirements into specific technical implementations. Third, organizations lack mechanisms for operationalizing governance at scale, with no systematic approach to embed trustworthy AI practices throughout the development lifecycle, measure compliance quantitatively, or provide role-appropriate visibility from boards to data scientists. We present AI TIPS, Artificial Intelligence Trust-Integrated Pillars for Sustainability 2.0, update to the comprehensive operational framework developed in 2019,four years before NIST's AI Risk Management Framework, that directly addresses these challenges.

Abstract: Understanding how humans and AI systems interpret ambiguous visual stimuli offers critical insight into the nature of perception, reasoning, and decision-making. This paper examines image labeling performance across human participants and deep neural networks, focusing on low-resolution, perceptually degraded stimuli. Drawing from computational cognitive science, cognitive architectures, and connectionist-symbolic hybrid models, we contrast human strategies such as analogical reasoning, shape-based recognition, and confidence modulation with AI's feature-based processing. Grounded in Marr's tri-level hypothesis, Simon's bounded rationality, and Thagard's frameworks of representation and emotion, we analyze participant responses in relation to Grad-CAM visualizations of model attention. Human behavior is further interpreted through cognitive principles modeled in ACT-R and Soar, revealing layered and heuristic decision strategies under uncertainty. Our findings highlight key parallels and divergences between biological and artificial systems in representation, inference, and confidence calibration. The analysis motivates future neuro-symbolic architectures that unify structured symbolic reasoning with connectionist representations. Such architectures, informed by principles of embodiment, explainability, and cognitive alignment, offer a path toward AI systems that are not only performant but also interpretable and cognitively grounded.

Abstract: Drug discovery is a time-consuming and expensive process, with traditional high-throughput and docking-based virtual screening hampered by low success rates and limited scalability. Recent advances in generative modelling, including autoregressive, diffusion, and flow-based approaches, have enabled de novo ligand design beyond the limits of enumerative screening. Yet these models often suffer from inadequate generalization, limited interpretability, and an overemphasis on binding affinity at the expense of key pharmacological properties, thereby restricting their translational utility. Here we present Trio, a molecular generation framework integrating fragment-based molecular language modeling, reinforcement learning, and Monte Carlo tree search, for effective and interpretable closed-loop targeted molecular design. Through the three key components, Trio enables context-aware fragment assembly, enforces physicochemical and synthetic feasibility, and guides a balanced search between the exploration of novel chemotypes and the exploitation of promising intermediates within protein binding pockets. Experimental results show that Trio reliably achieves chemically valid and pharmacologically enhanced ligands, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches with improved binding affinity (+7.85%), drug-likeness (+11.10%) and synthetic accessibility (+12.05%), while expanding molecular diversity more than fourfold.

Conclusion: 此框架代表了LLM辅助端到端规划的重要进展，能够处理LLM通常难以解决的小规模规划实例，并保持计划步骤的正确性

Abstract: We present an end-to-end framework for planning supported by verifiers. An orchestrator receives a human specification written in natural language and converts it into a PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) model, where the domain and problem are iteratively refined by sub-modules (agents) to address common planning requirements, such as time constraints and optimality, as well as ambiguities and contradictions that may exist in the human specification. The validated domain and problem are then passed to an external planning engine to generate a plan. The orchestrator and agents are powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and require no human intervention at any stage of the process. Finally, a module translates the final plan back into natural language to improve human readability while maintaining the correctness of each step. We demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of our framework across various domains and tasks, including the Google NaturalPlan benchmark and PlanBench, as well as planning problems like Blocksworld and the Tower of Hanoi (where LLMs are known to struggle even with small instances). Our framework can be integrated with any PDDL planning engine and validator (such as Fast Downward, LPG, POPF, VAL, and uVAL, which we have tested) and represents a significant step toward end-to-end planning aided by LLMs.

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search is a cornerstone algorithm for online planning, and its root-parallel variant is widely used when wall clock time is limited but best performance is desired. In environments with continuous action spaces, how to best aggregate statistics from different threads is an important yet underexplored question. In this work, we introduce a method that uses Gaussian Process Regression to obtain value estimates for promising actions that were not trialed in the environment. We perform a systematic evaluation across 6 different domains, demonstrating that our approach outperforms existing aggregation strategies while requiring a modest increase in inference time.

Abstract: The massive scale of modern AI accelerators presents critical challenges to traditional fault assessment methodologies, which face prohibitive computational costs and provide poor coverage of critical failure modes. This paper introduces RIFT (Reinforcement Learning-guided Intelligent Fault Targeting), a scalable framework that automates the discovery of minimal, high-impact fault scenarios for efficient design-time fault assessment. RIFT transforms the complex search for worst-case faults into a sequential decision-making problem, combining hybrid sensitivity analysis for search space pruning with reinforcement learning to intelligently generate minimal, high-impact test suites. Evaluated on billion-parameter Large Language Model (LLM) workloads using NVIDIA A100 GPUs, RIFT achieves a \textbf{2.2$\times$} fault assessment speedup over evolutionary methods and reduces the required test vector volume by over \textbf{99\%} compared to random fault injection, all while achieving \textbf{superior fault coverage}. The proposed framework also provides actionable data to enable intelligent hardware protection strategies, demonstrating that RIFT-guided selective error correction code provides a \textbf{12.8$\times$} improvement in \textbf{cost-effectiveness} (coverage per unit area) compared to uniform triple modular redundancy protection. RIFT automatically generates UVM-compliant verification artifacts, ensuring its findings are directly actionable and integrable into commercial RTL verification workflows.

Abstract: This paper develops a geometric framework for modeling belief, motivation, and influence across cognitively heterogeneous agents. Each agent is represented by a personalized value space, a vector space encoding the internal dimensions through which the agent interprets and evaluates meaning. Beliefs are formalized as structured vectors-abstract beings-whose transmission is mediated by linear interpretation maps. A belief survives communication only if it avoids the null spaces of these maps, yielding a structural criterion for intelligibility, miscommunication, and belief death.
  Within this framework, I show how belief distortion, motivational drift, counterfactual evaluation, and the limits of mutual understanding arise from purely algebraic constraints. A central result-"the No-Null-Space Leadership Condition"-characterizes leadership as a property of representational reachability rather than persuasion or authority. More broadly, the model explains how abstract beings can propagate, mutate, or disappear as they traverse diverse cognitive geometries.
  The account unifies insights from conceptual spaces, social epistemology, and AI value alignment by grounding meaning preservation in structural compatibility rather than shared information or rationality. I argue that this cognitive-geometric perspective clarifies the epistemic boundaries of influence in both human and artificial systems, and offers a general foundation for analyzing belief dynamics across heterogeneous agents.

Abstract: Metadata vocabularies are essential for advancing FAIR and FARR data principles, but their development constrained by limited human resources and inconsistent standardization practices. This paper introduces MatSci-YAMZ, a platform that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) and human-in-the-loop (HILT), including crowdsourcing, to support metadata vocabulary development. The paper reports on a proof-of-concept use case evaluating the AI-HILT model in materials science, a highly interdisciplinary domain Six (6) participants affiliated with the NSF Institute for Data-Driven Dynamical Design (ID4) engaged with the MatSci-YAMZ plaform over several weeks, contributing term definitions and providing examples to prompt the AI-definitions refinement. Nineteen (19) AI-generated definitions were successfully created, with iterative feedback loops demonstrating the feasibility of AI-HILT refinement. Findings confirm the feasibility AI-HILT model highlighting 1) a successful proof of concept, 2) alignment with FAIR and open-science principles, 3) a research protocol to guide future studies, and 4) the potential for scalability across domains. Overall, MatSci-YAMZ's underlying model has the capacity to enhance semantic transparency and reduce time required for consensus building and metadata vocabulary development.

Motivation: 解决现有基于大语言模型的规划方法计算成本高、部署困难且参数固定无法适应特定任务的问题，旨在提高文本环境中长期规划的效率和适应性。

Method: SCOPE是一种一次性分层规划器，仅在初始化时利用LLM生成的子目标来预训练轻量级学生模型，直接从示例轨迹推导子目标，避免了训练和推理期间重复查询LLM的需求。

Result: 在TextCraft环境中，相比需反复查询LLM的ADaPT方法（成功率0.52），SCOPE达到0.56的成功率，并将推理时间从164.4秒大幅减少到3.0秒，显著提升效率。

Conclusion: 尽管LLM生成的子目标可能不是最优且牺牲了部分可解释性，但仍然是文本规划任务中分层目标分解的有效起点，表明轻量级学生模型可以在不使用昂贵LLM查询的情况下实现竞争性性能。

Abstract: Long-term planning in complex, text-based environments presents significant challenges due to open-ended action spaces, ambiguous observations, and sparse feedback. Recent research suggests that large language models (LLMs) encode rich semantic knowledge about the world, which can be valuable for guiding agents in high-level reasoning and planning across both embodied and purely textual settings. However, existing approaches often depend heavily on querying LLMs during training and inference, making them computationally expensive and difficult to deploy efficiently. In addition, these methods typically employ a pretrained, unaltered LLM whose parameters remain fixed throughout training, providing no opportunity for adaptation to the target task. To address these limitations, we introduce SCOPE (Subgoal-COnditioned Pretraining for Efficient planning), a one-shot hierarchical planner that leverages LLM-generated subgoals only at initialization to pretrain a lightweight student model. Unlike prior approaches that distill LLM knowledge by repeatedly prompting the model to adaptively generate subgoals during training, our method derives subgoals directly from example trajectories. This design removes the need for repeated LLM queries, significantly improving efficiency, though at the cost of reduced explainability and potentially suboptimal subgoals. Despite their suboptimality, our results on the TextCraft environment show that LLM-generated subgoals can still serve as a strong starting point for hierarchical goal decomposition in text-based planning tasks. Compared to the LLM-based hierarchical agent ADaPT (Prasad et al., 2024), which achieves a 0.52 success rate, our method reaches 0.56 and reduces inference time from 164.4 seconds to just 3.0 seconds.

Abstract: Electromagnetic formation flight (EMFF) uses the electromagnetic force to control the relative positions of multiple satellites without using conventional fuel-based propulsion. To compensate for the electromagnetic torque generated alongside the electromagnetic force, in most previous studies, all satellites were assumed to have reaction wheels (RWs) besides electromagnetic coils. However, the RW-loaded angular momentum becomes non-uniformly distributed among the satellites, because the electromagnetic torque usually differs between satellites. Without a proper control scheme, this deviation increases over time, and the RWs become saturated quickly, preventing the attitudes of the satellites from being controlled. In this study, a new controller is proposed that enables the electromagnetic force and torque to be controlled simultaneously. The EMFF kinematics derived from the conservation of angular momentum are used for the controller design. This controller can control $n$ satellites without saturating the RWs, and only one set of RWs is required among all satellites. The combination of the proposed controller with a simple unloading control exclusive to the chief satellite results in the elimination of the accumulation of angular momentum in the entire system. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated through numerical simulations of the formation maintenance and formation reconfiguration of a five-satellite system.

Abstract: Understanding driver interactions is critical to designing autonomous vehicles to interoperate safely with human-driven cars. We consider the impact of these interactions on the policies drivers employ when navigating unsigned intersections in a driving simulator. The simulator allows the collection of naturalistic decision-making and behavior data in a controlled environment. Using these data, we model the human driver responses as state-based feedback controllers learned via Gaussian Process regression methods. We compute the feedback gain of the controller using a weighted combination of linear and nonlinear priors. We then analyze how the individual gains are reflected in driver behavior. We also assess differences in these controllers across populations of drivers. Our work in data-driven analyses of how drivers determine their policies can facilitate future work in the design of socially responsive autonomy for vehicles.

Abstract: In on-orbit robotics, a servicer satellite's ability to make contact with a free-spinning target satellite is essential to completing most on-orbit servicing (OOS) tasks. This manuscript develops a nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) framework that generates feasible controls for a servicer satellite to achieve zero-impulse contact with a free-spinning target satellite. The overall maneuver requires coordination between two separately actuated modules of the servicer satellite: (1) a moment generation module and (2) a manipulation module. We apply MPC to control both modules by explicitly modeling the cross-coupling dynamics between them. We demonstrate that the MPC controller can enforce actuation and state constraints that prior control approaches could not account for. We evaluate the performance of the MPC controller by simulating zero-impulse contact scenarios with a free-spinning target satellite via numerical Monte Carlo (MC) trials and comparing the simulation results with prior control approaches. Our simulation results validate the effectiveness of the MPC controller in maintaining spin synchronization and zero-impulse contact under operation constraints, moving contact location, and observation and actuation noise.

Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning-based framework for optimizing the operation of electric arc furnaces (EAFs) under volatile electricity prices. We formulate the deterministic version of the EAF scheduling problem into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation, and then develop a Q-learning algorithm to perform real-time control of multiple EAF units under real-time price volatility and shared feeding capacity constraints. We design a custom reward function for the Q-learning algorithm to smooth the start-up penalties of the EAFs. Using real data from EAF designs and electricity prices in New York State, we benchmark our algorithm against a baseline rule-based controller and a MILP benchmark, assuming perfect price forecasts. The results show that our reinforcement learning algorithm achieves around 90% of the profit compared to the perfect MILP benchmark in various single-unit and multi-unit cases under a non-anticipatory control setting.

Motivation: 随着基于逆变器资源的规模化并网，电力系统的频率/电压响应恶化，稳定性风险增加。现有方法通常单独评估频率和电压强度，使用不同的指标，缺乏对系统整体强度的全面理解，可能忽视关键方面。

Result: 研究发现传统强度分析通常忽略共模电压响应（CM-V），而在PE主导的电力系统中，CM-V也可能变得不稳定。提出的统一框架能够全面评估系统强度，新指标能有效评估各模态分量的强度。

Conclusion: 该论文提出的统一框架为PE主导电力系统的频率/电压强度分析提供了更全面的方法，通过区分共模和差模响应，能够更准确地评估系统稳定性，并发现了共模电压响应的潜在不稳定风险。

Abstract: The large-scale integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) has deteriorated the frequency/voltage (F/V) responses of power systems, leading to a higher risk of instability. Consequently, evaluating the F/V strength has become an important task in power electronics (PE)-dominated power systems. Existing methods typically examine F/V strength separately, employing fundamentally different metrics, such as inertia (focusing on device dynamics) and short-circuit ratio (SCR, addressing network characteristics). These fragmented approaches have resulted in a lack of comprehensive understanding of the overall system strength, potentially overlooking critical aspects. To address this problem, this paper proposes a unified framework for analyzing F/V strength. First, a unified modeling of F/V regulations is introduced. Then, based on modal decoupling, the power systems are decomposed into several eigen-subsystems, where the F/V responses are both decomposed into common-mode (CM) and differential-mode (DM) components, namely, CM-F, DM-F, CM-V, and DM-V. The CM-F and CM-V represent the collective response of all devices to external active or reactive power disturbances, independent of the power network characteristics. In contrast, the DM-F and DM-V capture the redistribution of disturbance power within the system, which is strongly influenced by the network topology and the locations of devices. Notably, traditional strength analysis generally ignores the CM-V (global voltage response), which, as discovered in this paper, may also become unstable in PE-dominated power systems. Based on the proposed framework, new metrics are proposed to evaluate the strength of each modal component. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through simulations.

Existing testing approaches often rely on surrogate models of decision-making agents to generate large-scale scenario libraries; however, discrepancies between surrogate models and real decision-making agents significantly limit their generalizability and practical applicability. To address this challenge, this paper proposes intelligent resilience testing (IRTest), a unified online adaptive testing framework designed to rapidly adjust to diverse decision-making agents. IRTest initializes with an offline-trained surrogate prediction model and progressively reduces surrogate-to-real gap during testing through two complementary adaptation mechanisms: (i) online neural fine-tuning in data-rich regimes, and (ii) lightweight importance-sampling-based weighting correction in data-limited regimes. A Bayesian optimization strategy, equipped with bias-corrected acquisition functions, guides scenario generation to balance exploration and exploitation in complex testing spaces. Extensive experiments across varying levels of task complexity and system heterogeneity demonstrate that IRTest consistently improves failure-discovery efficiency, testing robustness, and cross-system generalizability. These results highlight the potential of IRTest as a practical solution for scalable, adaptive, and resilient testing of decision-making agents.

Abstract: Wireless communication is essential to achieve coordinated control in vehicle platoons. However, packet losses in wireless communication can cause critical safety issues when they occur in conjunction with sudden brakes. In this paper, we propose simulation-based methods that allow the study of such safety issues by determining the absolute minimum distance between vehicles over time for various control parameters that guarantee string stability. For our proposed time-discretized simulations, we provide two methods for selecting different time-step intervals to ensure that the error in distance approximation remains within specified bounds at all times. Through numerical examples we demonstrate that among control parameters that guarantee string stability some perform better than others under simultaneously occurring packet losses and sudden brakes.

Abstract: In this letter we introduce POLARNet -- power control of multi-layer repeater networks -- for local optimization of SNR given different repeater power constraints. We assume relays or repeaters in groups or layers spatially separated. Under ideal circumstances SISO narrow-band communication and TDD, the system may be viewed as a dual to a deep neural network, where activations, corresponding to repeater amplifications, are optimized and weight matrices, corresponding to channel matrices, are static. Repeater amplifications are locally optimized layer-by-layer in a forward-backward manner over compact sets. The method is applicable for a wide range of constraints on within-layer power/energy utilization, is furthermore gradient-free, step-size-free, and has proven monotonicity in the objective. Numerical simulations show significant improvement compared to upper bounds on the expected SNR. In addition, power distribution over multiple repeaters is shown to be superior to optimal selection of single repeaters in the layers.

Abstract: Efficient tuning of building climate controllers to optimize occupant utility is essential for ensuring overall comfort and satisfaction. However, this is a challenging task since the latent utility are difficult to measure directly. Time-varying contextual factors, such as outdoor temperature, further complicate the problem. To address these challenges, we propose a contextual preferential Bayesian optimization algorithm that leverages binary preference feedback together with contextual information to enable efficient real-time controller tuning. We validate the approach by tuning an economic MPC controller on BOPTEST, a high-fidelity building simulation platform. Over a two-month simulation period, our method outperforms the baseline controller and achieves an improvement of up to 23% in utility. Moreover, for different occupant types, we demonstrate that the algorithm automatically adapts to individual preferences, enabling personalized controller tuning.

Abstract: This letter seeks to clarify the different existing definitions of both instantaneous complex phase and frequency as well as their equivalence when specific hypotheses hold. To achieve this, the two fundamental definitions, i.e., those based on either the use of (i) analytic signals or (ii) space vectors, together with the premises used for their formulation, are presented and their relationship shown. Lastly, an unified notation and terminology to avoid confusion is proposed.

Abstract: Real-time model predictive control of non-smooth switching systems remains challenging due to discontinuities and the presence of discrete modes, which complicate numerical integration and optimization. This paper presents a real-time feasible non-smooth model predictive control scheme for a physical three-tank process, implemented without mixed-integer formulations. The approach combines Filippov system modeling with finite elements and switch detection for time discretization, leading to a finite-dimensional optimal control problem formulated as a mathematical program with complementarity constraints. The mathematical program is solved via a homotopy of smooth nonlinear programs. We introduce modeling adjustments that make the three-tank dynamics numerically tractable, including additional modes to avoid non-Lipschitz points and undefined function values. Hardware experiments demonstrate efficient handling of switching events, mode-consistent tracking across reference changes, correct boundary handling, and constraint satisfaction. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of model mismatch and show that the tracking performance and computation times remain within real-time limits for the chosen sampling time. The complete controller is implemented using the non-smooth optimal control framework NOSNOC

Abstract: A control-theoretic framework for autonomous avatar-guided rehabilitation in virtual reality, based on interpretable, adaptive motor guidance through optimal control, is presented. The framework faces critical challenges in motor rehabilitation due to accessibility, cost, and continuity of care, with over 50% of patients inability to attend regular clinic sessions. The system enables post-stroke patients to undergo personalized therapy in immersive virtual reality at home, while being monitored by clinicians. The core is a nonlinear, human-in-the-loop control strategy, where the avatar adapts in real time to the patient's performance. Balance between following the patient's movements and guiding them to ideal kinematic profiles based on the Hogan minimum-jerk model is achieved through multi-objective optimal control. A data-driven "ability index" uses smoothness metrics to dynamically adjust control gains according to the patient's progress. The system was validated through simulations and preliminary trials, and shows potential for delivering adaptive, engaging and scalable remote physiotherapy guided by interpretable control-theoretic principles.

Abstract: This work presents a conceptual study on the application of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for decentralized control of unmanned aerial vehicles to relay a critical data package to a known position. For this purpose, a family of deterministic games is introduced, designed for scaling studies for MARL. A robust baseline policy is proposed, which is based on restricting agent motion envelopes and applying Dijkstra's algorithm. Experimental results show that two off-the-shelf MARL algorithms perform competitively with the baseline for a small number of agents, but scalability issues arise as the number of agents increase.
