TL;DR: 针对计算病理学基础模型中存在的技术变异偏差问题，本文提出了一种通过引入鲁棒性损失函数来训练下游任务特定模型的方法，无需重新训练基础模型本身即可提升模型的鲁棒性和预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算病理学中的基础模型不仅捕获了生物学相关特征，还包含了预处理和扫描仪特异性变异等技术偏差，这会影响基于这些特征训练的任务特定模型的预测性能。解决这些技术变异对模型鲁棒性的影响是将计算病理学模型应用于真实世界临床实践的关键。

Method: 研究提出在训练下游任务特定模型时引入新颖的鲁棒性损失函数，以减少对技术变异的敏感性。使用包含27,042个全切片图像和6,155名患者的综合性实验设置，基于八种流行的计算病理学基础模型的特征训练了数千个模型。

Result: 该方法不仅显著提高了模型对技术变异的鲁棒性，还通过聚焦于生物学相关特征而提升了预测准确性。实验证明无需重新训练基础模型本身就能有效缓解基础模型的鲁棒性问题。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够成功缓解计算病理学基础模型的鲁棒性问题，使计算病理学模型能够更好地应用于常规临床实践中的真实世界数据，为实现通用性强、性能优异的深度学习系统提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Foundation models in histopathology are expected to facilitate the development of high-performing and generalisable deep learning systems. However, current models capture not only biologically relevant features, but also pre-analytic and scanner-specific variation that bias the predictions of task-specific models trained from the foundation model features. Here we show that introducing novel robustness losses during training of downstream task-specific models reduces sensitivity to technical variability. A purpose-designed comprehensive experimentation setup with 27,042 WSIs from 6155 patients is used to train thousands of models from the features of eight popular foundation models for computational pathology. In addition to a substantial improvement in robustness, we observe that prediction accuracy improves by focusing on biologically relevant features. Our approach successfully mitigates robustness issues of foundation models for computational pathology without retraining the foundation models themselves, enabling development of robust computational pathology models applicable to real-world data in routine clinical practice.

Abstract: Recent advances in 4D scene reconstruction have significantly improved dynamic modeling across various domains. However, existing approaches remain limited under aerial conditions with single-view capture, wide spatial range, and dynamic objects of limited spatial footprint and large motion disparity. These challenges cause severe depth ambiguity and unstable motion estimation, making monocular aerial reconstruction inherently ill-posed. To this end, we present AeroDGS, a physics-guided 4D Gaussian splatting framework for monocular UAV videos. AeroDGS introduces a Monocular Geometry Lifting module that reconstructs reliable static and dynamic geometry from a single aerial sequence, providing a robust basis for dynamic estimation. To further resolve monocular ambiguity, we propose a Physics-Guided Optimization module that incorporates differentiable ground-support, upright-stability, and trajectory-smoothness priors, transforming ambiguous image cues into physically consistent motion. The framework jointly refines static backgrounds and dynamic entities with stable geometry and coherent temporal evolution. We additionally build a real-world UAV dataset that spans various altitudes and motion conditions to evaluate dynamic aerial reconstruction. Experiments on synthetic and real UAV scenes demonstrate that AeroDGS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior reconstruction fidelity in dynamic aerial environments.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Accurate prediction of malignancy in renal tumors is crucial for informing clinical decisions and optimizing treatment strategies. However, existing imaging modalities lack the necessary accuracy to reliably predict malignancy before surgical intervention. While deep learning has shown promise in malignancy prediction using 3D CT images, traditional approaches often rely on manual segmentation to isolate the tumor region and reduce noise, which enhances predictive performance. Manual segmentation, however, is labor-intensive, costly, and dependent on expert knowledge. In this study, a deep learning framework was developed utilizing an Organ Focused Attention (OFA) loss function to modify the attention of image patches so that organ patches attend only to other organ patches. Hence, no segmentation of 3D renal CT images is required at deployment time for malignancy prediction. The proposed framework achieved an AUC of 0.685 and an F1-score of 0.872 on a private dataset from the UF Integrated Data Repository (IDR), and an AUC of 0.760 and an F1-score of 0.852 on the publicly available KiTS21 dataset. These results surpass the performance of conventional models that rely on segmentation-based cropping for noise reduction, demonstrating the frameworks ability to enhance predictive accuracy without explicit segmentation input. The findings suggest that this approach offers a more efficient and reliable method for malignancy prediction, thereby enhancing clinical decision-making in renal cancer diagnosis.

*Cheng Shi,Yizhou Yu,Sibei Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文发现视觉Transformer(ViT)在不同监督范式下游任务中存在显著伪影问题，源于使用语义不相关的背景patches作为捷径来表示全局语义，并提出选择性整合patch特征到CLS token的解决方案


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉Transformer在大规模数据预训练后为多样化下游任务提供了通用表示，但不同监督范式下的ViT都存在广泛观察到的伪影，其根本机制尚未充分阐明，需要系统分析这些伪影的成因并提出改进方案

Method: 通过系统分析伪影成因，发现ViT采用懒惰聚合行为——使用语义不相关的背景patches作为捷径来表示全局语义，受全局注意力和粗粒度语义监督驱动。提出的解决方案有选择性地将patch特征整合到CLS token中，减少背景主导的捷径影响

Result: 提出的方法在标签监督、文本监督和自监督三种范式下的12个基准测试中都获得了性能的持续提升

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了ViT中背景patches作为捷径的本质，为理解ViT行为提供了新视角，并证明选择性整合patch特征可有效提升模型性能

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs), when pre-trained on large-scale data, provide general-purpose representations for diverse downstream tasks. However, artifacts in ViTs are widely observed across different supervision paradigms and downstream tasks. Through systematic analysis of artifacts in ViTs, we find that their fundamental mechanisms have yet to be sufficiently elucidated. In this paper, through systematic analysis, we conclude that these artifacts originate from a lazy aggregation behavior: ViT uses semantically irrelevant background patches as shortcuts to represent global semantics, driven by global attention and Coarse-grained semantic supervision. Our solution selectively integrates patch features into the CLS token, reducing the influence of background-dominated shortcuts and consistently improving performance across 12 benchmarks under label-, text-, and self-supervision. We hope this work offers a new perspective on ViT behavior.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种双耦合PnP扩散框架与谱同质化技术，解决了现有PnP扩散重建方法中存在的稳态偏差与幻觉伪影权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PnP扩散框架（如HQS、近端梯度）作为无记忆算子，仅依赖瞬时梯度更新估计，缺乏历史跟踪，导致重建结果存在非零稳态偏差，无法在强噪声下严格满足物理测量约束。

Method: 提出双耦合PnP扩散方法，通过恢复经典对偶变量提供积分反馈，理论上保证精确收敛到数据流形；同时引入谱同质化技术，将累积的对偶残差调制为符合AWGN假设的伪白噪声输入，使优化轨迹与去噪器统计流形对齐。

Result: 在CT和MRI重建实验中，该方法解决了偏差-幻觉权衡问题，在保持高保真度的同时显著加速收敛速度，达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 结合对偶变量的积分反馈机制和谱同质化技术可以同时解决PnP扩散重建中的稳态偏差问题和结构化伪影问题，为成像逆问题提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Plug-and-Play diffusion prior (PnPDP) frameworks have emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving imaging inverse problems by treating pretrained generative models as modular priors. However, we identify a critical flaw in prevailing PnP solvers (e.g., based on HQS or Proximal Gradient): they function as memoryless operators, updating estimates solely based on instantaneous gradients. This lack of historical tracking inevitably leads to non-vanishing steady-state bias, where the reconstruction fails to strictly satisfy physical measurements under heavy corruption. To resolve this, we propose Dual-Coupled PnP Diffusion, which restores the classical dual variable to provide integral feedback, theoretically guaranteeing asymptotic convergence to the exact data manifold. However, this rigorous geometric coupling introduces a secondary challenge: the accumulated dual residuals exhibit spectrally colored, structured artifacts that violate the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) assumption of diffusion priors, causing severe hallucinations. To bridge this gap, we introduce Spectral Homogenization (SH), a frequency-domain adaptation mechanism that modulates these structured residuals into statistically compliant pseudo-AWGN inputs. This effectively aligns the solver's rigorous optimization trajectory with the denoiser's valid statistical manifold. Extensive experiments on CT and MRI reconstruction demonstrate that our approach resolves the bias-hallucination trade-off, achieving state-of-the-art fidelity with significantly accelerated convergence.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: CLIP models learn transferable multi-modal features via image-text contrastive learning on internet-scale data. They are widely used in zero-shot classification, multi-modal retrieval, text-to-image diffusion, and as image encoders in large vision-language models. However, CLIP's pretraining is dominated by images paired with short captions, biasing the model toward encoding simple descriptions of salient objects and leading to coarse alignment on complex scenes and dense descriptions. While recent work mitigates this by fine-tuning on small-scale long-caption datasets, we identify an important common bias: both human- and LLM-generated long captions typically begin with a one-sentence summary followed by a detailed description. We show that this acts as a shortcut during training, concentrating attention on the opening sentence and early tokens and weakening alignment over the rest of the caption. To resolve this, we introduce DeBias-CLIP, which removes the summary sentence during training and applies sentence sub-sampling and text token padding to distribute supervision across all token positions. DeBias-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art long-text retrieval, improves short-text retrieval, and is less sensitive to sentence order permutations. It is a drop-in replacement for Long-CLIP with no additional trainable parameters.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), a critical question regarding their visual grounding mechanism remains unanswered: do these models genuinely ``read'' text embedded in images, or do they merely rely on parametric shortcuts in the text prompt? In this work, we diagnose this issue by introducing the Visualized-Question (VQ) setting, where text queries are rendered directly onto images to structurally mandate visual engagement. Our diagnostic experiments on Qwen2.5-VL reveal a startling capability-utilization gap: despite possessing strong OCR capabilities, models suffer a performance degradation of up to 12.7% in the VQ setting, exposing a deep-seated ``modality laziness.'' To bridge this gap, we propose SimpleOCR, a plug-and-play training strategy that imposes a structural constraint on the learning process. By transforming training samples into the VQ format with randomized styles, SimpleOCR effectively invalidates text-based shortcuts, compelling the model to activate and optimize its visual text extraction pathways. Empirically, SimpleOCR yields robust gains without architectural modifications. On four representative OOD benchmarks, it surpasses the base model by 5.4% and GRPO based on original images by 2.7%, while exhibiting extreme data efficiency, achieving superior performance with 30x fewer samples (8.5K) than recent RL-based methods. Furthermore, its plug-and-play nature allows seamless integration with advanced RL strategies like NoisyRollout to yield complementary improvements.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探索在边缘设备上使用多模态大语言模型进行实时在线情景记忆问答的可行性，提出了双线程流式处理架构，在资源受限条件下达到了与云端方案相近的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于云端的多模态大语言模型解决方案在处理可穿戴设备的情景记忆问答时存在隐私泄露和延迟问题，因此需要研究在边缘设备上实施的可行性，以提供隐私保护的低延迟服务。

Method: 设计了一个包含两个异步线程的问答流水线：描述符线程持续将视频转换为轻量级文本记忆；问答线程基于文本记忆进行推理回答问题。在QA-Ego4D-Closed基准测试中评估了多模态大语言模型在严格资源限制下的性能。

Result: 在消费级8GB GPU上实现了51.76%的准确率和0.41秒的首令牌响应时间；在企业级本地服务器上达到54.40%准确率和0.88秒TTFT；云端解决方案准确率为56.00%。边缘方案与云端方案性能相近。

Conclusion: 研究证明了基于边缘的多模态大语言模型在保护隐私的情景记忆检索任务中具有可行性和竞争力，为可穿戴助手等隐私敏感应用提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We investigate the feasibility of using Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for real-time online episodic memory question answering. While cloud offloading is common, it raises privacy and latency concerns for wearable assistants, hence we investigate implementation on the edge. We integrated streaming constraints into our question answering pipeline, which is structured into two asynchronous threads: a Descriptor Thread that continuously converts video into a lightweight textual memory, and a Question Answering (QA) Thread that reasons over the textual memory to answer queries. Experiments on the QAEgo4D-Closed benchmark analyze the performance of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) within strict resource boundaries, showing promising results also when compared to clound-based solutions. Specifically, an end-to-end configuration running on a consumer-grade 8GB GPU achieves 51.76% accuracy with a Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) of 0.41s. Scaling to a local enterprise-grade server yields 54.40% accuracy with a TTFT of 0.88s. In comparison, a cloud-based solution obtains an accuracy of 56.00%. These competitive results highlight the potential of edge-based solutions for privacy-preserving episodic memory retrieval.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MammoWise 是一个本地化多模型管道系统，能将开源视觉语言模型转换为乳腺X光报告生成器和多任务分类器，支持多种提示技术和检索增强生成，在保留报告质量的同时提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺X光筛查具有高工作量、时间敏感和文档繁重的特点，且现有基于视觉语言模型的报告生成系统常依赖封闭云系统或紧密耦合架构，限制了隐私性、可复现性和适应性。

Method: 开发MammoWise系统，支持任何Ollama托管的VLM和乳腺X光数据集，实现零样本、少样本和思维链提示，可选使用向量数据库的多模态检索增强生成进行病例特定上下文引用。

Result: 在VinDr-Mammo和DMID数据集上评估MedGemma、LLaVA-Med和Qwen2.5-VL模型，报告生成表现稳定且通过少样本提示和RAG进一步提升；分类任务可行但对模型和数据集选择敏感；通过QLoRA微调MedGemma提高了可靠性，达到了BI-RADS准确率0.7545、密度准确率0.8840和钙化准确率0.9341。

Conclusion: MammoWise为在统一且可复现的工作流中部署本地VLM进行乳腺X光报告提供了实用且可扩展的框架。

Abstract: Screening mammography is high volume, time sensitive, and documentation heavy. Radiologists must translate subtle visual findings into consistent BI-RADS assessments, breast density categories, and structured narrative reports. While recent Vision Language Models (VLMs) enable image-to-text reporting, many rely on closed cloud systems or tightly coupled architectures that limit privacy, reproducibility, and adaptability. We present MammoWise, a local multi-model pipeline that transforms open source VLMs into mammogram report generators and multi-task classifiers. MammoWise supports any Ollama-hosted VLM and mammography dataset, and enables zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought prompting, with optional multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using a vector database for case-specific context. We evaluate MedGemma, LLaVA-Med, and Qwen2.5-VL on VinDr-Mammo and DMID datasets, assessing report quality (BERTScore, ROUGE-L), BI-RADS classification, breast density, and key findings. Report generation is consistently strong and improves with few-shot prompting and RAG. Classification is feasible but sensitive to model and dataset choice. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (QLoRA) of MedGemma improves reliability, achieving BI-RADS accuracy of 0.7545, density accuracy of 0.8840, and calcification accuracy of 0.9341 while preserving report quality. MammoWise provides a practical and extensible framework for deploying local VLMs for mammography reporting within a unified and reproducible workflow.

TL;DR: SCR是无需训练、推理时干预的方法，通过重分布注意力的隐状态激活来缓解视觉语言模型的对象幻觉问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型常出现输入图像中不存在物体的幻觉，根源在于空间信用崩溃：早期transformer层中激活信用集中在稀疏视觉块，抑制了上下文证据并增加了对语言先验的依赖

Method: 提出空间信用重分布(SCR)：基于低熵输入的引导，将高注意力源块的隐状态激活重新分布到其上下文。在6个模型家族(Chameleon、LLaVA、Qwen等)的7B、13B、30B规模上评估

Result: 在POPE-Adversarial上减少幻觉约4.7-6.0个百分点；CHAIR-s降低3.7-5.2个百分点(相对42-51%)；CHAIR-i降低2.7-4.4个百分点(相对44-58%)；CIDEr保持在0.8个百分点内。计算开销仅43-56ms，远低于其他方法

Conclusion: 注意力引导的源块选择是关键的：替换为均匀随机选择会大幅降低效果，证实信用崩溃是主要驱动因素。SCR在保持生成质量的同时显著减少幻觉，适用于实时场景

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) frequently hallucinate objects absent from the input image. We trace this failure to spatial credit collapse: activation credit concentrating on sparse visual patches in early transformer layers, which suppresses contextual evidence and increases reliance on language priors. We introduce Spatial Credit Redistribution (SCR), a training-free inference-time intervention that redistributes hidden-state activation from high-attention source patches to their context, guided by low-entropy inputs. We evaluate six model families (Chameleon, LLaVA, and Qwen, including both Qwen-VL and Qwen2-VL) at scales of 7B, 13B, and 30B, on POPE and CHAIR benchmarks. SCR reduces hallucination by ~4.7-6.0 percentage points on POPE-Adversarial, cuts CHAIR-s by 3.7-5.2 percentage points (42-51 percent relative), and CHAIR-i by 2.7-4.4 percentage points (44-58 percent relative), and preserves CIDEr within 0.8 percentage points. Gains are largest for low-entropy inputs, consistent with the theoretical framework. SCR incurs only 43-56 ms overhead (small models: +43-46 ms; large models: +54-56 ms), roughly 3-6 times lower than OPERA and VCD and 1.3-1.7 times lower than OVCD (+72 ms), while Pareto-dominating all three on both hallucination rate and CIDEr, making it practical for real-time settings. A controlled ablation confirms that attention-guided source selection is essential: replacing it with uniform random selection reduces hallucination rate gains from ~4.7-6.0 percentage points to only ~2.6-3.4 percentage points, pointing to credit-collapse as the key driver.

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) uses a reference image plus a natural-language edit to retrieve images that apply the requested change while preserving other relevant visual content. Classic fusion pipelines typically rely on supervised triplets and can lose fine-grained cues, while recent zero-shot approaches often caption the reference image and merge the caption with the edit, which may miss implicit user intent and return repetitive results. We present Pix2Key, which represents both queries and candidates as open-vocabulary visual dictionaries, enabling intent-aware constraint matching and diversity-aware reranking in a unified embedding space. A self-supervised pretraining component, V-Dict-AE, further improves the dictionary representation using only images, strengthening fine-grained attribute understanding without CIR-specific supervision. On the DFMM-Compose benchmark, Pix2Key improves Recall@10 up to 3.2 points, and adding V-Dict-AE yields an additional 2.3-point gain while improving intent consistency and maintaining high list diversity.

Abstract: Tau positron emission tomography (tau-PET) provides an in vivo marker of Alzheimer's disease pathology, but cost and limited availability motivate MRI-based alternatives. We introduce DisQ-HNet (DQH), a framework that synthesizes tau-PET from paired T1-weighted and FLAIR MRI while exposing how each modality contributes to the prediction. The method combines (i) a Partial Information Decomposition (PID)-guided, vector-quantized encoder that partitions latent information into redundant, unique, and complementary components, and (ii) a Half-UNet decoder that preserves anatomical detail using pseudo-skip connections conditioned on structural edge cues rather than direct encoder feature reuse. Across multiple baselines (VAE, VQ-VAE, and UNet), DisQ-HNet maintains reconstruction fidelity and better preserves disease-relevant signal for downstream AD tasks, including Braak staging, tau localization, and classification. PID-based Shapley analysis provides modality-specific attribution of synthesized uptake patterns.

Conclusion: DrivePTS通过解耦条件依赖、增强语义指导和提升结构保真度，显著提升了驾驶场景合成的质量与可控性，为自动驾驶系统测试提供了更有效的合成数据。

Abstract: Synthesis of diverse driving scenes serves as a crucial data augmentation technique for validating the robustness and generalizability of autonomous driving systems. Current methods aggregate high-definition (HD) maps and 3D bounding boxes as geometric conditions in diffusion models for conditional scene generation. However, implicit inter-condition dependency causes generation failures when control conditions change independently. Additionally, these methods suffer from insufficient details in both semantic and structural aspects. Specifically, brief and view-invariant captions restrict semantic contexts, resulting in weak background modeling. Meanwhile, the standard denoising loss with uniform spatial weighting neglects foreground structural details, causing visual distortions and blurriness. To address these challenges, we propose DrivePTS, which incorporates three key innovations. Firstly, our framework adopts a progressive learning strategy to mitigate inter-dependency between geometric conditions, reinforced by an explicit mutual information constraint. Secondly, a Vision-Language Model is utilized to generate multi-view hierarchical descriptions across six semantic aspects, providing fine-grained textual guidance. Thirdly, a frequency-guided structure loss is introduced to strengthen the model's sensitivity to high-frequency elements, improving foreground structural fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our DrivePTS achieves state-of-the-art fidelity and controllability in generating diverse driving scenes. Notably, DrivePTS successfully generates rare scenes where prior methods fail, highlighting its strong generalization ability.

Motivation: 现有深度引导的3D重建方法存在尺度漂移、多视图不一致等问题，且需要大量优化才能获得高保真几何结构；需要一种能够快速生成跨视图一致深度图的方法，以提升下游重建效率与质量

Method: 提出神经深度校正场（Neural Depth Correction field）生成跨视图一致的深度图；通过反投影和重投影误差滤波生成高质量密集点云；以该几何初始化加速3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）的网格重建；同样提升3DGS在新视角合成的渲染质量

Conclusion: 将神经深度优化与鲁棒的几何初始化结合，能够实现高效高保真的3D重建；SwiftNDC证明了强几何初始化对加速3DGS重建与提升渲染质量的有效性

Abstract: Depth-guided 3D reconstruction has gained popularity as a fast alternative to optimization-heavy approaches, yet existing methods still suffer from scale drift, multi-view inconsistencies, and the need for substantial refinement to achieve high-fidelity geometry. Here, we propose SwiftNDC, a fast and general framework built around a Neural Depth Correction field that produces cross-view consistent depth maps. From these refined depths, we generate a dense point cloud through back-projection and robust reprojection-error filtering, obtaining a clean and uniformly distributed geometric initialization for downstream reconstruction. This reliable dense geometry substantially accelerates 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for mesh reconstruction, enabling high-quality surfaces with significantly fewer optimization iterations. For novel-view synthesis, SwiftNDC can also improve 3DGS rendering quality, highlighting the benefits of strong geometric initialization. We conduct a comprehensive study across five datasets, including two for mesh reconstruction, as well as three for novel-view synthesis. SwiftNDC consistently reduces running time for accurate mesh reconstruction and boosts rendering fidelity for view synthesis, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining neural depth refinement with robust geometric initialization for high-fidelity and efficient 3D reconstruction.

TL;DR: QARMVC框架针对多视图聚类问题，通过信息瓶颈提取语义特征，利用重建误差量化异构噪声强度，并提出分层学习策略来抑制噪声影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅基于完美清洁或完全损坏的二元噪声假设，忽略了实际应用中普遍存在的异构观测噪声（噪声强度在数据间连续变化）。需要设计能够处理连续变化噪声强度的多视图聚类方法。

Method: 1. 利用信息瓶颈机制提取内在语义进行视图重建；2. 基于重建差异量化实例级噪声强度和质量分数；3. 特征层：设计质量加权对比目标自适应抑制噪声传播；4. 融合层：通过质量加权聚合构建高质量全局共识，并通过互信息最大化对齐和修正局部视图。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，QARMVC持续优于最先进的基线方法，特别是在异构噪声强度场景中表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: QARMVC通过精确量化连续变化的噪声强度和层次化学习策略，有效提升了多视图聚类对异构噪声的鲁棒性，为实际应用中的噪声处理提供了新思路。

Abstract: Deep multi-view clustering has achieved remarkable progress but remains vulnerable to complex noise in real-world applications. Existing noisy robust methods predominantly rely on a simplified binary assumption, treating data as either perfectly clean or completely corrupted. This overlooks the prevalent existence of heterogeneous observation noise, where contamination intensity varies continuously across data. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework termed Quality-Aware Robust Multi-View Clustering (QARMVC). Specifically, QARMVC employs an information bottleneck mechanism to extract intrinsic semantics for view reconstruction. Leveraging the insight that noise disrupts semantic integrity and impedes reconstruction, we utilize the resulting reconstruction discrepancy to precisely quantify fine-grained contamination intensity and derive instance-level quality scores. These scores are integrated into a hierarchical learning strategy: at the feature level, a quality-weighted contrastive objective is designed to adaptively suppress the propagation of noise; at the fusion level, a high-quality global consensus is constructed via quality-weighted aggregation, which is subsequently utilized to align and rectify local views via mutual information maximization. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that QARMVC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in scenarios with heterogeneous noise intensities.

TL;DR: 论文发现当前扩散引导方法的评估存在严重偏见，并提出了新的GA-Eval评估框架和TDG方法揭示问题，建议重新思考这一领域的发展方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前扩散引导方法（如classifier-free guidance）虽然提升了条件生成质量，但新兴方法是否真的带来了实质改进存在疑问。研究发现评估过程中偏好模型对高引导尺度存在强烈偏见，导致评估结果失真。

Method: 1）揭示了评估偏好模型的尺度偏差问题；2）提出GA-Eval框架，通过引导尺度校准公平比较不同方法；3）设计了TDG方法来演示评估偏差问题；4）在传统评估框架和GA-Eval框架下实证分析了八种扩散引导方法。

Result: 研究发现：1）仅增加CFG尺度就能在传统评估中改善分数，即使图像质量严重受损；2）大多数研究的扩散引导方法在公平比较下与标准CFG竞争有限；3）所有方法在胜率上相对标准CFG都有显著下降。

Conclusion: 当前扩散引导方法的评估存在系统性偏差，许多所谓改进实际效果有限。建议社区重新思考评估范式，避免被误导性的定量指标所迷惑，重点关注实质性的算法创新。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) has helped diffusion models achieve great conditional generation in various fields. Recently, more diffusion guidance methods have emerged with improved generation quality and human preference. However, can these emerging diffusion guidance methods really achieve solid and significant improvements? In this paper, we rethink recent progress on diffusion guidance. Our work mainly consists of four contributions. First, we reveal a critical evaluation pitfall that common human preference models exhibit a strong bias towards large guidance scales. Simply increasing the CFG scale can easily improve quantitative evaluation scores due to strong semantic alignment, even if image quality is severely damaged (e.g., oversaturation and artifacts). Second, we introduce a novel guidance-aware evaluation (GA-Eval) framework that employs effective guidance scale calibration to enable fair comparison between current guidance methods and CFG by identifying the effects orthogonal and parallel to CFG effects. Third, motivated by the evaluation pitfall, we design Transcendent Diffusion Guidance (TDG) method that can significantly improve human preference scores in the conventional evaluation framework but actually does not work in practice. Fourth, in extensive experiments, we empirically evaluate recent eight diffusion guidance methods within the conventional evaluation framework and the proposed GA-Eval framework. Notably, simply increasing the CFG scales can compete with most studied diffusion guidance methods, while all methods suffer severely from winning rate degradation over standard CFG. Our work would strongly motivate the community to rethink the evaluation paradigm and future directions of this field.

*Tianyu Chen,Wei Xiang,Kang Han,Yu Lu,Di Wu,Gaowen Liu,Ramana Rao Kompella*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 一种纯前馈、可迭代精炼的新框架GIFSplat，用于从稀疏无位姿图像重建3D高斯溅射场景，通过多次前向残差更新显著提升效果且保持秒级推理速度，并引入基于增强渲染的生成先验提升泛化性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有前馈式3D重建方法虽有较快推理速度，但性能尤其在域外数据上仍有提升空间，同时难以在引入生成先验时维持秒级推理时间。问题根源于一次性预测范式：模型严格受限于容量、缺乏推理时优化能力，且不适于持续注入生成先验。

Method: 提出GIFSplat，一种纯前馈的迭代精炼框架，通过少量前向残差更新，逐步利用渲染证据精炼当前3D场景；同时通过蒸馏扩散模型先验，从增强的新视角渲染提取高斯级引导，无需梯度反向传播或不断扩大的视图集，从而实现基于生成先验的单场景适应。

Result: 在DL3DV、RealEstate10K和DTU数据集上，GIFSplat始终优于现有前馈基线，PSNR最高提升+2.1 dB，且保持秒级的推理时间，无需相机位姿或任何测试时梯度优化。

Conclusion: GIFSplat通过迭代前向残差更新与生成先验的精炼机制，在前馈3D高斯溅射重建中实现了效率和质量的良好平衡，并在多个标准数据集上取得了超越现有方法的结果，同时保持了快速推理的优势。

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D reconstruction offers substantial runtime advantages over per-scene optimization, which remains slow at inference and often fragile under sparse views. However, existing feed-forward methods still have potential for further performance gains, especially for out-of-domain data, and struggle to retain second-level inference time once a generative prior is introduced. These limitations stem from the one-shot prediction paradigm in existing feed-forward pipeline: models are strictly bounded by capacity, lack inference-time refinement, and are ill-suited for continuously injecting generative priors. We introduce GIFSplat, a purely feed-forward iterative refinement framework for 3D Gaussian Splatting from sparse unposed views. A small number of forward-only residual updates progressively refine current 3D scene using rendering evidence, achieve favorable balance between efficiency and quality. Furthermore, we distill a frozen diffusion prior into Gaussian-level cues from enhanced novel renderings without gradient backpropagation or ever-increasing view-set expansion, thereby enabling per-scene adaptation with generative prior while preserving feed-forward efficiency. Across DL3DV, RealEstate10K, and DTU, GIFSplat consistently outperforms state-of-the-art feed-forward baselines, improving PSNR by up to +2.1 dB, and it maintains second-scale inference time without requiring camera poses or any test-time gradient optimization.

Conclusion: CMDM框架成功结合了扩散模型的高质量和自回归模型的时间因果关系，实现了高质量、低延迟的文本到运动生成，支持流式合成和长时程运动生成

Abstract: Recent advances in motion diffusion models have substantially improved the realism of human motion synthesis. However, existing approaches either rely on full-sequence diffusion models with bidirectional generation, which limits temporal causality and real-time applicability, or autoregressive models that suffer from instability and cumulative errors. In this work, we present Causal Motion Diffusion Models (CMDM), a unified framework for autoregressive motion generation based on a causal diffusion transformer that operates in a semantically aligned latent space. CMDM builds upon a Motion-Language-Aligned Causal VAE (MAC-VAE), which encodes motion sequences into temporally causal latent representations. On top of this latent representation, an autoregressive diffusion transformer is trained using causal diffusion forcing to perform temporally ordered denoising across motion frames. To achieve fast inference, we introduce a frame-wise sampling schedule with causal uncertainty, where each subsequent frame is predicted from partially denoised previous frames. The resulting framework supports high-quality text-to-motion generation, streaming synthesis, and long-horizon motion generation at interactive rates. Experiments on HumanML3D and SnapMoGen demonstrate that CMDM outperforms existing diffusion and autoregressive models in both semantic fidelity and temporal smoothness, while substantially reducing inference latency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有目标检测模型（如YOLO系列和DETR系列）主要关注前景对象特征，忽略了背景提供的上下文信息。然而背景信息对目标检测有重要帮助（如车辆更可能出现在道路上，野生动物更可能出现在森林中）。

Method: 提出了Association DETR目标检测模型，该模型能够有效利用背景上下文信息来增强检测能力。

Result: 在COCO val2017数据集上，Association DETR相比其他目标检测模型取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 背景上下文信息对目标检测任务有显著帮助，Association DETR通过利用这些信息实现了性能的突破。

Abstract: Real-time object detection has advanced rapidly in recent years. The YOLO series of detectors is among the most well-known CNN-based object detection models and cannot be overlooked. The latest version, YOLOv26, was recently released, while YOLOv12 achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with 55.2 mAP on the COCO val2017 dataset. Meanwhile, transformer-based object detection models, also known as DEtection TRansformer (DETR), have demonstrated impressive performance. RT-DETR is an outstanding model that outperformed the YOLO series in both speed and accuracy when it was released. Its successor, RT-DETRv2, achieved 53.4 mAP on the COCO val2017 dataset. However, despite their remarkable performance, all these models let information to slip away. They primarily focus on the features of foreground objects while neglecting the contextual information provided by the background. We believe that background information can significantly aid object detection tasks. For example, cars are more likely to appear on roads rather than in offices, while wild animals are more likely to be found in forests or remote areas rather than on busy streets. To address this gap, we propose an object detection model called Association DETR, which achieves state-of-the-art results compared to other object detection models on the COCO val2017 dataset.

TL;DR: BetterScene利用Stable Video Diffusion(SVD)提升稀疏实拍图像的新视图合成质量，通过对VAE模块引入时间等变性正则化和视觉基础模型对齐表示，结合3DGS渲染特征，在DL3DV-10K数据集上取得最优效果。


<details>

Motivation: 现有方法依赖预训练扩散先验且仅微调UNet模块，即使加入深度等几何感知正则化，仍存在细节不一致和伪影问题。

Method: 1) 在SVD的VAE模块中引入时间等变性正则化；2) 加入视觉基础模型对齐表示；3) 结合前馈式3D高斯泼溅模型渲染特征作为SVD增强器输入。

Result: 在DL3DV-10K数据集上相比现有方法表现出更优性能，能生成连续、无伪影、一致的新视图。

Conclusion: 通过针对性改进VAE模块的表示学习，结合3DGS渲染，BetterScene有效提升了稀疏实拍场景的新视图合成质量。

Abstract: We present BetterScene, an approach to enhance novel view synthesis (NVS) quality for diverse real-world scenes using extremely sparse, unconstrained photos. BetterScene leverages the production-ready Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) model pretrained on billions of frames as a strong backbone, aiming to mitigate artifacts and recover view-consistent details at inference time. Conventional methods have developed similar diffusion-based solutions to address these challenges of novel view synthesis. Despite significant improvements, these methods typically rely on off-the-shelf pretrained diffusion priors and fine-tune only the UNet module while keeping other components frozen, which still leads to inconsistent details and artifacts even when incorporating geometry-aware regularizations like depth or semantic conditions. To address this, we investigate the latent space of the diffusion model and introduce two components: (1) temporal equivariance regularization and (2) vision foundation model-aligned representation, both applied to the variational autoencoder (VAE) module within the SVD pipeline. BetterScene integrates a feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model to render features as inputs for the SVD enhancer and generate continuous, artifact-free, consistent novel views. We evaluate on the challenging DL3DV-10K dataset and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有光场成像系统需要同时捕获事件和强度图像，硬件实现限制较多；本文旨在探索仅使用事件相机的纯事件式光场成像方案，简化硬件实现复杂度。

Method: 采用编码孔径的事件相机系统，通过理论分析阐明孔径编码模式中黑色图案的关键作用，提出从事件数据中重建4D光场的完整方法和算法改进。

Result: 成功在真实成像硬件上实现，能够从纯事件数据重建具有像素级精度的4D光场，验证了纯事件式光场成像的可行性。

Conclusion: Coded-E2LF是首个仅依赖事件数据就能重建高精度4D光场的方法，突破了传统光场成像对强度图像的依赖，为事件相机在计算成像领域的应用开辟了新方向。

Abstract: We propose Coded-E2LF (coded event to light field), a computational imaging method for acquiring a 4-D light field using a coded aperture and a stationary event-only camera. In a previous work, an imaging system similar to ours was adopted, but both events and intensity images were captured and used for light field reconstruction. In contrast, our method is purely event-based, which relaxes restrictions for hardware implementation. We also introduce several advancements from the previous work that enable us to theoretically support and practically improve light field reconstruction from events alone. In particular, we clarify the key role of a black pattern in aperture coding patterns. We finally implemented our method on real imaging hardware to demonstrate its effectiveness in capturing real 3-D scenes. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that a 4-D light field with pixel-level accuracy can be reconstructed from events alone. Our software and supplementary video are available from our project website.

TL;DR: CGSA是首个将面向对象学习（OCL）引入无源领域自适应目标检测（SF-DAOD）的框架，通过将槽感知适应集成到DETR检测器中，在多个跨领域数据集上超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: CGSA展示了面向对象设计在隐私敏感适应场景中的潜力，首次将OCL成功应用于SF-DAOD任务，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptive Object Detection (SF-DAOD) aims to adapt a detector trained on a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain without retaining any source data. Despite recent progress, most popular approaches focus on tuning pseudo-label thresholds or refining the teacher-student framework, while overlooking object-level structural cues within cross-domain data. In this work, we present CGSA, the first framework that brings Object-Centric Learning (OCL) into SF-DAOD by integrating slot-aware adaptation into the DETR-based detector. Specifically, our approach integrates a Hierarchical Slot Awareness (HSA) module into the detector to progressively disentangle images into slot representations that act as visual priors. These slots are then guided toward class semantics via a Class-Guided Slot Contrast (CGSC) module, maintaining semantic consistency and prompting domain-invariant adaptation. Extensive experiments on multiple cross-domain datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms previous SF-DAOD methods, with theoretical derivations and experimental analysis further demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed components and the framework, thereby indicating the promise of object-centric design in privacy-sensitive adaptation scenarios.

Abstract: Editing images via instruction provides a natural way to generate interactive content, but it is a big challenge due to the higher requirement of scene understanding and generation. Prior work utilizes a chain of large language models, object segmentation models, and editing models for this task. However, the understanding models provide only a single modality ability, restricting the editing quality. We aim to bridge understanding and generation via a new multi-modality model that provides the intelligent abilities to instruction-based image editing models for more complex cases. To achieve this goal, we individually separate the instruction editing task with the multi-modality chain of thought prompts, i.e., Chain-of-Thought (CoT) planning, editing region reasoning, and editing. For Chain-of-Thought planning, the large language model could reason the appropriate sub-prompts considering the instruction provided and the ability of the editing network. For editing region reasoning, we train an instruction-based editing region generation network with a multi-modal large language model. Finally, a hint-guided instruction-based editing network is proposed for editing image generations based on the sizeable text-to-image diffusion model to accept the hints for generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method has competitive editing abilities on complex real-world images.

Conclusion: 通过联合组装与生成的方法，CRAG能处理传统方法无法合成的缺失几何，代码和模型将开源。

Abstract: Most existing 3D assembly methods treat the problem as pure pose estimation, rearranging observed parts via rigid transformations. In contrast, human assembly naturally couples structural reasoning with holistic shape inference. Inspired by this intuition, we reformulate 3D assembly as a joint problem of assembly and generation. We show that these two processes are mutually reinforcing: assembly provides part-level structural priors for generation, while generation injects holistic shape context that resolves ambiguities in assembly. Unlike prior methods that cannot synthesize missing geometry, we propose CRAG, which simultaneously generates plausible complete shapes and predicts poses for input parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across in-the-wild objects with diverse geometries, varying part counts, and missing pieces. Our code and models will be released.

Abstract: In structure from motion, quadrifocal tensors capture more information than their pairwise counterparts (essential matrices), yet they have often been thought of as impractical and only of theoretical interest. In this work, we challenge such beliefs by providing a new framework to recover $n$ cameras from the corresponding collection of quadrifocal tensors. We form the block quadrifocal tensor and show that it admits a Tucker decomposition whose factor matrices are the stacked camera matrices, and which thus has a multilinear rank of (4,~4,~4,~4) independent of $n$. We develop the first synchronization algorithm for quadrifocal tensors, using Tucker decomposition, alternating direction method of multipliers, and iteratively reweighted least squares. We further establish relationships between the block quadrifocal, trifocal, and bifocal tensors, and introduce an algorithm that jointly synchronizes these three entities. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on modern datasets, indicating the potential and importance of using higher-order information in synchronization.

Abstract: Missing modalities present a fundamental challenge in multimodal models, often causing catastrophic performance degradation. Our observations suggest that this fragility stems from an imbalanced learning process, where the model develops an implicit preference for certain modalities, leading to the under-optimization of others. We propose a simple yet efficient method to address this challenge. The central insight of our work is that the dominance relationship between modalities can be effectively discerned and quantified in the frequency domain. To leverage this principle, we first introduce a Frequency Ratio Metric (FRM) to quantify modality preference by analyzing features in the frequency domain. Guided by FRM, we then propose a Multimodal Weight Allocation Module, a plug-and-play component that dynamically re-balances the contribution of each branch during training, promoting a more holistic learning paradigm. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MWAM can be seamlessly integrated into diverse architectural backbones, such as those based on CNNs and ViTs. Furthermore, MWAM delivers consistent performance gains across a wide range of tasks and modality combinations. This advancement extends beyond merely optimizing the performance of the base model; it also manifests as further performance improvements to state-of-the-art methods addressing the missing modality problem.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Interactive Medical-SAM2 GUI is an open-source desktop application for semi-automatic annotation of 2D and 3D medical images. Built on the Napari multi-dimensional viewer, box/point prompting is integrated with SAM2-style propagation by treating a 3D volume as a slice sequence, enabling mask propagation from sparse prompts using Medical-SAM2 on top of SAM2. Voxel-level annotation remains essential for developing and validating medical imaging algorithms, yet manual labeling is slow and expensive for 3D scans, and existing integrations frequently emphasize per-slice interaction without providing a unified, cohort-oriented workflow for navigation, propagation, interactive correction, and quantitative export in a single local pipeline. To address this practical limitation, a local-first Napari workflow is provided for efficient 3D annotation across multiple studies using standard DICOM series and/or NIfTI volumes. Users can annotate cases sequentially under a single root folder with explicit proceed/skip actions, initialize objects via box-first prompting (including first/last-slice initialization for single-object propagation), refine predictions with point prompts, and finalize labels through prompt-first correction prior to saving. During export, per-object volumetry and 3D volume rendering are supported, and image geometry is preserved via SimpleITK. The GUI is implemented in Python using Napari and PyTorch, with optional N4 bias-field correction, and is intended exclusively for research annotation workflows. The code is released on the project page: https://github.com/SKKU-IBE/Medical-SAM2GUI/.

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in image and video generation, yet their practical deployment remains hindered by the substantial computational overhead of multi-step iterative sampling. Among acceleration strategies, caching-based methods offer a training-free and effective solution by reusing or predicting features across timesteps. However, existing approaches rely on fixed or locally adaptive schedules without considering the global structure of the denoising trajectory, often leading to error accumulation and visual artifacts. To overcome this limitation, we propose DPCache, a novel training-free acceleration framework that formulates diffusion sampling acceleration as a global path planning problem. DPCache constructs a Path-Aware Cost Tensor from a small calibration set to quantify the path-dependent error of skipping timesteps conditioned on the preceding key timestep. Leveraging this tensor, DPCache employs dynamic programming to select an optimal sequence of key timesteps that minimizes the total path cost while preserving trajectory fidelity. During inference, the model performs full computations only at these key timesteps, while intermediate outputs are efficiently predicted using cached features. Extensive experiments on DiT, FLUX, and HunyuanVideo demonstrate that DPCache achieves strong acceleration with minimal quality loss, outperforming prior acceleration methods by $+$0.031 ImageReward at 4.87$\times$ speedup and even surpassing the full-step baseline by $+$0.028 ImageReward at 3.54$\times$ speedup on FLUX, validating the effectiveness of our path-aware global scheduling framework. Code will be released at https://github.com/argsss/DPCache.

These shortcomings provide limited support for model development and multimodal perception research. We propose a practical approach for AVQA dataset construction. First, we design a crowdsourced subjective experiment framework for AVQA, breaks the constraints of in-lab settings and achieves reliable annotation across varied environments. Second, a systematic data preparation strategy is further employed to ensure broad coverage of both quality levels and semantic scenarios. Third, we extend the dataset with additional annotations, enabling research on multimodal perception mechanisms and their relation to content. Finally, we validate this approach through YT-NTU-AVQ, the largest and most diverse AVQA dataset to date, consisting of 1,620 user-generated audio and video (A/V) sequences. The dataset and platform code are available at https://github.com/renyu12/YT-NTU-AVQ

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的基于可微分渲染的自监督方法（如3D高斯泼溅）对初始部件分割高度敏感，依赖启发式聚类或预训练模型容易导致优化陷入局部极小值，尤其对于复杂的多部件物体

Method: 通过几何特征和运动先验指导的过分割初始化生成具有合理运动假设的部件提议；在优化过程中分析空间邻居间的运动一致性动态合并提议；使用碰撞感知的运动剪枝机制防止错误的运动估计

Result: 在合成和真实物体上进行的大量实验表明，ArtPro能够稳健地重建复杂的多部件物体，在准确性和稳定性方面显著优于现有方法

Conclusion: ArtPro框架通过自适应整合运动提议的方法，有效解决了传统方法对初始分割敏感的局限性，实现了复杂多部件物体的高质量数字孪生重建

Abstract: Reconstructing articulated objects into high-fidelity digital twins is crucial for applications such as robotic manipulation and interactive simulation. Recent self-supervised methods using differentiable rendering frameworks like 3D Gaussian Splatting remain highly sensitive to the initial part segmentation. Their reliance on heuristic clustering or pre-trained models often causes optimization to converge to local minima, especially for complex multi-part objects. To address these limitations, we propose ArtPro, a novel self-supervised framework that introduces adaptive integration of mobility proposals. Our approach begins with an over-segmentation initialization guided by geometry features and motion priors, generating part proposals with plausible motion hypotheses. During optimization, we dynamically merge these proposals by analyzing motion consistency among spatial neighbors, while a collision-aware motion pruning mechanism prevents erroneous kinematic estimation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world objects demonstrate that ArtPro achieves robust reconstruction of complex multi-part objects, significantly outperforming existing methods in accuracy and stability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种室内开放词汇3D占据预测方法，通过几何监督和语言嵌入高斯表示，解决了现有方法在室内场景中无法有效适应密集几何、复杂布局和细粒度语义的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的开放词汇3D占据预测多聚焦于室外驾驶场景，但难以处理室内环境中更密集的几何、更复杂的布局和更细粒度的语义类别。需要一种仅使用二值占据标签（占据 vs 自由）的监督范式来应对这些挑战。

Method: 框架基于3D语言嵌入高斯作为统一中间表示，耦合细粒度几何与语言对齐语义嵌入。几何方面，提出不透明度感知的泊松基体素聚合方法；语义方面，提出渐进温度衰减计划，在渲染中逐步锐化不透明度以增强高斯-语言对齐。

Result: 在Occ-ScanNet数据集上的开放词汇设置中，取得59.50 IoU和21.05 mIoU，在IoU上超越所有现有占据方法，在mIoU上大幅领先此前开放词汇方法。

Conclusion: 提出的基于几何监督和语言嵌入高斯的框架能够有效处理室内开放词汇3D占据预测任务，在几何重建和语义理解方面均取得显著提升。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D occupancy is vital for embodied agents, which need to understand complex indoor environments where semantic categories are abundant and evolve beyond fixed taxonomies. While recent work has explored open-vocabulary occupancy in outdoor driving scenarios, such methods transfer poorly indoors, where geometry is denser, layouts are more intricate, and semantics are far more fine-grained. To address these challenges, we adopt a geometry-only supervision paradigm that uses only binary occupancy labels (occupied vs free). Our framework builds upon 3D Language-Embedded Gaussians, which serve as a unified intermediate representation coupling fine-grained 3D geometry with a language-aligned semantic embedding. On the geometry side, we find that existing Gaussian-to-Occupancy operators fail to converge under such weak supervision, and we introduce an opacity-aware, Poisson-based approach that stabilizes volumetric aggregation. On the semantic side, direct alignment between rendered features and open-vocabulary segmentation features suffers from feature mixing; we therefore propose a Progressive Temperature Decay schedule that gradually sharpens opacities during splatting, strengthening Gaussian-language alignment. On Occ-ScanNet, our framework achieves 59.50 IoU and 21.05 mIoU in the open-vocabulary setting, surpassing all existing occupancy methods in IoU and outperforming prior open-vocabulary approaches by a large margin in mIoU. Code will be released at https://github.com/JuIvyy/LegoOcc.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了ViCLIP-OT，一个专为越南语图像-文本检索设计的基础视觉-语言模型，通过结合对比学习和相似图正则化最优传输损失来提升跨模态一致性，并在三个越南语基准测试中显著优于现有基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型主要针对高资源语言优化，而在越南语等低资源语言上的表现欠佳，需要专门针对越南语的跨模态检索模型。

Method: 提出ViCLIP-OT框架，整合CLIP风格的对比学习和相似图正则化最优传输损失，以增强全局跨模态一致性并缓解模态鸿沟问题。

Result: 在UITOpenViIC、KTVIC和Crossmodal-3600三个越南语基准测试中，ViCLIP-OT在领域内和零样本设置下均优于CLIP和SigLIP基线。在UIT-OpenViIC上的平均Recall@K达到67.34%，比CLIP提升了5.75个百分点；在Crossmodal-3600的零样本评估中比CLIP提升了11.72个百分点。

Conclusion: SIGROT整合为低资源语言的跨模态检索提供了有效且可扩展的策略，对越南语及其他代表性不足语言环境中的智能多媒体检索系统具有实际意义。

Abstract: Image-text retrieval has become a fundamental component in intelligent multimedia systems; however, most existing vision-language models are optimized for highresource languages and remain suboptimal for low-resource settings such as Vietnamese. This work introduces ViCLIP-OT, a foundation vision-language model specifically designed for Vietnamese image-text retrieval. The proposed framework integrates CLIP-style contrastive learning with a Similarity-Graph Regularized Optimal Transport (SIGROT) loss to enhance global cross-modal consistency and mitigate modality gap issues. Extensive experiments on three Vietnamese benchmarks (UITOpenViIC, KTVIC, and Crossmodal-3600) demonstrate that ViCLIP-OT consistently outperforms CLIP and SigLIP baselines in both in-domain and zero-shot settings. On UIT-OpenViIC, the model achieves an average Recall@K of 67.34%, improving upon CLIP by 5.75 percentage points. In zero-shot evaluation on Crossmodal-3600, ViCLIPOT surpasses CLIP by 11.72 percentage points. Embedding-space analysis further confirms improved alignment and reduced modality gap. The results indicate that integrating SIGROT provides an effective and scalable strategy for cross-modal retrieval in low-resource languages, offering practical implications for intelligent multimedia retrieval systems in Vietnamese and other underrepresented linguistic contexts.

Abstract: Latent diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in high-fidelity text-to-image generation, but their tendency to memorize training data raises critical privacy and intellectual property concerns. Membership inference attacks (MIAs) provide a principled way to audit such memorization by determining whether a given sample was included in training. However, existing approaches assume access to ground-truth captions. This assumption fails in realistic scenarios where only images are available and their textual annotations remain undisclosed, rendering prior methods ineffective when substituted with vision-language model (VLM) captions. In this work, we propose MoFit, a caption-free MIA framework that constructs synthetic conditioning inputs that are explicitly overfitted to the target model's generative manifold. Given a query image, MoFit proceeds in two stages: (i) model-fitted surrogate optimization, where a perturbation applied to the image is optimized to construct a surrogate in regions of the model's unconditional prior learned from member samples, and (ii) surrogate-driven embedding extraction, where a model-fitted embedding is derived from the surrogate and then used as a mismatched condition for the query image. This embedding amplifies conditional loss responses for member samples while leaving hold-outs relatively less affected, thereby enhancing separability in the absence of ground-truth captions. Our comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets and diffusion models demonstrate that MoFit consistently outperforms prior VLM-conditioned baselines and achieves performance competitive with caption-dependent methods.

Abstract: Prior dual-stream methods with the feature interaction mechanism have achieved remarkable performance in single image reflection removal (SIRR). However, they often struggle with (1) semantic understanding gap between the features of pre-trained models and those of reflection removal models, and (2) reflection label inconsistencies between synthetic and real-world training data. In this work, we first adopt the parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategy by integrating several learnable Mona layers into the pre-trained model to align the training directions. Then, a label generator is designed to unify the reflection labels for both synthetic and real-world data. In addition, a Gaussian-based Adaptive Frequency Learning Block (G-AFLB) is proposed to adaptively learn and fuse the frequency priors, and a Dynamic Agent Attention (DAA) is employed as an alternative to window-based attention by dynamically modeling the significance levels across windows (inter-) and within an individual window (intra-). These components constitute our proposed Gap-Free Reflection Removal Network (GFRRN). Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our GFRRN, achieving superior performance against state-of-the-art SIRR methods.

Abstract: Small target detection in UAV imagery faces significant challenges such as scale variations, dense distribution, and the dominance of small targets. Existing algorithms rely on manually designed components, and general-purpose detectors are not optimized for UAV images, making it difficult to balance accuracy and complexity. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an end-to-end object detection framework, UFO-DETR, which integrates an LSKNet-based backbone network to optimize the receptive field and reduce the number of parameters. By combining the DAttention and AIFI modules, the model flexibly models multi-scale spatial relationships, improving multi-scale target detection performance. Additionally, the DynFreq-C3 module is proposed to enhance small target detection capability through cross-space frequency feature enhancement. Experimental results show that, compared to RT-DETR-L, the proposed method offers significant advantages in both detection performance and computational efficiency, providing an efficient solution for UAV edge computing.

Abstract: 3D Large Vision-Language Models (3D LVLMs) built upon Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across various multimodal tasks. However, their inherited position-dependent modeling mechanism, Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), remains suboptimal for 3D multimodal understanding. The vanilla RoPE formulation fails to preserve essential three-dimensional spatial structures when encoding 3D tokens, and its relative distance computation overlooks angular dependencies, hindering the model's ability to capture directional variations in visual representations. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Spherical Coordinate-based Positional Embedding (SoPE). Our method maps point-cloud token indices into a 3D spherical coordinate space, enabling unified modeling of spatial locations and directional angles. This formulation preserves the inherent geometric structure of point-cloud data, enhances spatial awareness, and yields more consistent and expressive geometric representations for multimodal learning. In addition, we introduce a multi-scale frequency mixing strategy to fuse feature information across different frequency domains. Experimental results on multiple 3D scene benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach, while real-world deployment experiments further demonstrate its strong generalization capability.

Motivation: 超声成像中存在的斑点和相关伪影会降低图像质量，影响诊断准确性，因此需要有效的去斑点方法来提升图像质量。

Method: 基于Image Restoration Stochastic Differential Equations框架构建扩散模型进行去斑点处理，通过使用Matlab UltraSound Toolbox将无斑点的磁共振图像模拟成超声图像，构建大型配对数据集进行监督训练。

Result: 在模拟测试集上，该方法在去斑点效果上一致优于经典滤波器和最近的基于学习的去斑点基线方法，同时通过交叉模型方差量化预测不确定性，发现较高不确定性区域与较高重建误差相关。

Conclusion: 提出的扩散模型在超声去斑点任务中表现出色，但不确定性分析揭示了模拟探针设置带来的域偏移问题，因此需要多样化训练和适应策略来实现稳健的临床部署。

Abstract: Ultrasound imaging is widely used for real-time, noninvasive diagnosis, but speckle and related artifacts reduce image quality and can hinder interpretation. We present a diffusion-based ultrasound despeckling method built on the Image Restoration Stochastic Differential Equations framework. To enable supervised training, we curate large paired datasets by simulating ultrasound images from speckle-free magnetic resonance images using the Matlab UltraSound Toolbox. The proposed model reconstructs speckle-suppressed images while preserving anatomically meaningful edges and contrast. On a held-out simulated test set, our approach consistently outperforms classical filters and recent learning-based despeckling baselines. We quantify prediction uncertainty via cross-model variance and show that higher uncertainty correlates with higher reconstruction error, providing a practical indicator of difficult or failure-prone regions. Finally, we evaluate sensitivity to simulation probe settings and observe domain shift, motivating diversified training and adaptation for robust clinical deployment.

Abstract: Object hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) significantly hinders their reliable deployment. Existing methods struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy: they often require expensive reference models and multiple forward passes, or apply static edits that risk suppressing genuine visual evidence. To address this, we introduce HulluEdit, a single-pass, reference-free intervention framework. Our core innovation is orthogonal subspace editing: we decompose the hidden states of the model into orthogonal subspaces - visual evidence, conflicting priors, and residual uncertainty - enabling selective suppression of hallucinatory patterns without interfering with visual grounding. This approach mathematically guarantees that edits applied to the prior subspace leave the visual component entirely unaffected. Extensive experiments show that HulluEdit achieves state-of-the-art hallucination reduction on benchmarks including POPE and CHAIR across diverse architectures, while preserving general capabilities on MME and maintaining efficient inference. Our method consistently outperforms contrastive decoding and static subspace editing baselines, offering a new pathway toward more trustworthy LVLMs.

Abstract: In this work, we study idiosyncrasies in the caption models and their downstream impact on text-to-image models. We design a systematic analysis: given either a generated caption or the corresponding image, we train neural networks to predict the originating caption model. Our results show that text classification yields very high accuracy (99.70\%), indicating that captioning models embed distinctive stylistic signatures. In contrast, these signatures largely disappear in the generated images, with classification accuracy dropping to at most 50\% even for the state-of-the-art Flux model. To better understand this cross-modal discrepancy, we further analyze the data and find that the generated images fail to preserve key variations present in captions, such as differences in the level of detail, emphasis on color and texture, and the distribution of objects within a scene. Overall, our classification-based framework provides a novel methodology for quantifying both the stylistic idiosyncrasies of caption models and the prompt-following ability of text-to-image systems.

Motivation: 当前RIS方法通常将视觉特征与语言特征融合后直接预测分割掩码，忽略了像素级的视觉-语言对齐关系，可能导致错误分割。作者提出显式建模像素级对齐来提升分割准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: Alignment-Aware Masked Learning (AML)：首先利用视觉-语言预训练模型（如CLIP）估计像素级对齐分数，然后在对齐分数空间施加soft mask，在训练过程中降低对齐不良区域的影响力。同时使用对齐感知监督和对齐感知提示来增强模型。

Conclusion: ProjFlow实现了训练自由、精确约束满足的高质量运动生成框架

Abstract: Generating human motion with precise spatial control is a challenging problem. Existing approaches often require task-specific training or slow optimization, and enforcing hard constraints frequently disrupts motion naturalness. Building on the observation that many animation tasks can be formulated as a linear inverse problem, we introduce ProjFlow, a training-free sampler that achieves zero-shot, exact satisfaction of linear spatial constraints while preserving motion realism. Our key advance is a novel kinematics-aware metric that encodes skeletal topology. This metric allows the sampler to enforce hard constraints by distributing corrections coherently across the entire skeleton, avoiding the unnatural artifacts of naive projection. Furthermore, for sparse inputs, such as filling in long gaps between a few keyframes, we introduce a time-varying formulation using pseudo-observations that fade during sampling. Extensive experiments on representative applications, motion inpainting, and 2D-to-3D lifting, demonstrate that ProjFlow achieves exact constraint satisfaction and matches or improves realism over zero-shot baselines, while remaining competitive with training-based controllers.

Abstract: Most text-to-video (T2V) generators prioritize aesthetic quality, but often ignoring the spatial constraints in the generated videos. In this work, we present SPATIALALIGN, a self-improvement framework that enhances T2V models capabilities to depict Dynamic Spatial Relationships (DSR) specified in text prompts. We present a zeroth-order regularized Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to fine-tune T2V models towards better alignment with DSR. Specifically, we design DSR-SCORE, a geometry-based metric that quantitatively measures the alignment between generated videos and the specified DSRs in prompts, which is a step forward from prior works that rely on VLM for evaluation. We also conduct a dataset of text-video pairs with diverse DSRs to facilitate the study. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our fine-tuned model significantly out performs the baseline in spatial relationships. The code will be released in Link.

Abstract: Recent advances in image authenticity have primarily focused on deepfake detection and localization, leaving recovery of tampered contents for factual retrieval relatively underexplored. We propose a unified hidden-code recovery framework that enables both retrieval and restoration from post-hoc and in-generation watermarking paradigms. Our method encodes semantic and perceptual information into a compact hidden-code representation, refined through multi-scale vector quantization, and enhances contextual reasoning via conditional Transformer modules. To enable systematic evaluation for natural images, we construct ImageNet-S, a benchmark that provides paired image-label factual retrieval tasks. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-S demonstrate that our method exhibits promising retrieval and reconstruction performance while remaining fully compatible with diverse watermarking pipelines. This framework establishes a foundation for general-purpose image recovery beyond detection and localization.

Abstract: Tokenization in video models, typically through patchification, generates an excessive and redundant number of tokens. This severely limits video efficiency and scalability. While recent trajectory-based tokenizers offer a promising solution by decoupling video duration from token count, they rely on complex external segmentation and tracking pipelines that are slow and task-agnostic. We propose TrajTok, an end-to-end video tokenizer module that is fully integrated and co-trained with video models for a downstream objective, dynamically adapting its token granularity to semantic complexity, independent of video duration. TrajTok contains a unified segmenter that performs implicit clustering over pixels in both space and time to directly produce object trajectories in a single forward pass. By prioritizing downstream adaptability over pixel-perfect segmentation fidelity, TrajTok is lightweight and efficient, yet empirically improves video understanding performance. With TrajTok, we implement a video CLIP model trained from scratch (TrajViT2). It achieves the best accuracy at scale across both classification and retrieval benchmarks, while maintaining efficiency comparable to the best token-merging methods. TrajTok also proves to be a versatile component beyond its role as a tokenizer. We show that it can be seamlessly integrated as either a probing head for pretrained visual features (TrajAdapter) or an alignment connector in vision-language models (TrajVLM) with especially strong performance in long-video reasoning.

Abstract: We introduce SceneTransporter, an end-to-end framework for structured 3D scene generation from a single image. While existing methods generate part-level 3D objects, they often fail to organize these parts into distinct instances in open-world scenes. Through a debiased clustering probe, we reveal a critical insight: this failure stems from the lack of structural constraints within the model's internal assignment mechanism. Based on this finding, we reframe the task of structured 3D scene generation as a global correlation assignment problem. To solve this, SceneTransporter formulates and solves an entropic Optimal Transport (OT) objective within the denoising loop of the compositional DiT model. This formulation imposes two powerful structural constraints. First, the resulting transport plan gates cross-attention to enforce an exclusive, one-to-one routing of image patches to part-level 3D latents, preventing entanglement. Second, the competitive nature of the transport encourages the grouping of similar patches, a process that is further regularized by an edge-based cost, to form coherent objects and prevent fragmentation. Extensive experiments show that SceneTransporter outperforms existing methods on open-world scene generation, significantly improving instance-level coherence and geometric fidelity. Code and models will be publicly available at https://2019epwl.github.io/SceneTransporter/.

Abstract: Human trajectory prediction plays a crucial role in applications such as autonomous navigation and video surveillance. While recent works have explored the integration of human skeleton sequences to complement trajectory information, skeleton data in real-world environments often suffer from missing joints caused by occlusions. These disturbances significantly degrade prediction accuracy, indicating the need for more robust skeleton representations. We propose a robust trajectory prediction method that incorporates a self-supervised skeleton representation model pretrained with masked autoencoding. Experimental results in occlusion-prone scenarios show that our method improves robustness to missing skeletal data without sacrificing prediction accuracy, and consistently outperforms baseline models in clean-to-moderate missingness regimes.

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence causes significant image degradation due to pixel displacement (tilt) and blur, particularly in long-range imaging applications. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for atmospheric turbulence mitigation, GSTurb, which integrates optical flow-guided tilt correction and Gaussian splatting for modeling non-isoplanatic blur. The framework employs Gaussian parameters to represent tilt and blur, and optimizes them across multiple frames to enhance restoration. Experimental results on the ATSyn-static dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving a peak PSNR of 27.67 dB and SSIM of 0.8735. Compared to the state-of-the-art method, GSTurb improves PSNR by 1.3 dB (a 4.5% increase) and SSIM by 0.048 (a 5.8% increase). Additionally, on real datasets, including the TSRWGAN Real-World and CLEAR datasets, GSTurb outperforms existing methods, showing significant improvements in both qualitative and quantitative performance. These results highlight that combining optical flow-guided tilt correction with Gaussian splatting effectively enhances image restoration under both synthetic and real-world turbulence conditions. The code for this method will be available at https://github.com/DuhlLiamz/3DGS_turbulence/tree/main.

Abstract: With the recent fast development of generative models, instruction-based image editing has shown great potential in generating high-quality images. However, the quality of editing highly depends on carefully designed instructions, placing the burden of task decomposition and sequencing entirely on the user. To achieve autonomous image editing, we present PhotoAgent, a system that advances image editing through explicit aesthetic planning. Specifically, PhotoAgent formulates autonomous image editing as a long-horizon decision-making problem. It reasons over user aesthetic intent, plans multi-step editing actions via tree search, and iteratively refines results through closed-loop execution with memory and visual feedback, without requiring step-by-step user prompts. To support reliable evaluation in real-world scenarios, we introduce UGC-Edit, an aesthetic evaluation benchmark consisting of 7,000 photos and a learned aesthetic reward model. We also construct a test set containing 1,017 photos to systematically assess autonomous photo editing performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhotoAgent consistently improves both instruction adherence and visual quality compared with baseline methods.

Abstract: Face aging, an ill-posed problem shaped by environmental and genetic factors, is vital in entertainment, forensics, and digital archiving, where realistic age transformations must preserve both identity and visual realism. However, existing works relying on numerical age representations overlook the interplay of biological and contextual cues. Despite progress in recent face aging models, they struggle with identity preservation in wide age transformations, also static attention and optimization-heavy inversion in diffusion limit adaptability, fine-grained control and background consistency. To address these challenges, we propose Face Time Traveller (FaceTT), a diffusion-based framework that achieves high-fidelity, identity-consistent age transformation. Here, we introduce a Face-Attribute-Aware Prompt Refinement strategy that encodes intrinsic (biological) and extrinsic (environmental) aging cues for context-aware conditioning. A tuning-free Angular Inversion method is proposed that efficiently maps real faces into the diffusion latent space for fast and accurate reconstruction. Moreover, an Adaptive Attention Control mechanism is introduced that dynamically balances cross-attention for semantic aging cues and self-attention for structural and identity preservation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and in-the-wild testset demonstrate that FaceTT achieves superior identity retention, background preservation and aging realism over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Abstract: Video polyp segmentation (VPS) is an important task in computer-aided colonoscopy, as it helps doctors accurately locate and track polyps during examinations. However, VPS remains challenging because polyps often look similar to surrounding mucosa, leading to weak semantic discrimination. In addition, large changes in polyp position and scale across video frames make stable and accurate segmentation difficult. To address these challenges, we propose a robust VPS framework named CMSA-Net. The proposed network introduces a Causal Multi-scale Aggregation (CMA) module to effectively gather semantic information from multiple historical frames at different scales. By using causal attention, CMA ensures that temporal feature propagation follows strict time order, which helps reduce noise and improve feature reliability. Furthermore, we design a Dynamic Multi-source Reference (DMR) strategy that adaptively selects informative and reliable reference frames based on semantic separability and prediction confidence. This strategy provides strong multi-frame guidance while keeping the model efficient for real-time inference. Extensive experiments on the SUN-SEG dataset demonstrate that CMSA-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, offering a favorable balance between segmentation accuracy and real-time clinical applicability.

Abstract: Soil texture is a foundational attribute that governs water availability and erosion in agriculture, as well as load bearing capacity, deformation response, and shrink-swell risk in geotechnical engineering. Yet texture is still typically determined by slow and labour intensive laboratory particle size tests, while many sensing alternatives are either costly or too coarse to support routine field scale deployment. This paper proposes a robust and field deployable multispectral imaging (MSI) system and machine learning framework for predicting soil composition and the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) texture classes. The proposed system uses a cost effective in-house MSI device operating from 365 nm to 940 nm to capture thirteen spectral bands, which effectively capture the spectral properties of soil texture. Regression models use the captured spectral properties to estimate clay, silt, and sand percentages, while a direct classifier predicts one of the twelve USDA textural classes. Indirect classification is obtained by mapping the regressed compositions to texture classes via the USDA soil texture triangle. The framework is evaluated on mixture data by mixing clay, silt, and sand in varying proportions, using the USDA classification triangle as a basis. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves a coefficient of determination R^2 up to 0.99 for composition prediction and over 99% accuracy for texture classification. These findings indicate that MSI combined with data-driven modeling can provide accurate, non-destructive, and field deployable soil texture characterization suitable for geotechnical screening and precision agriculture.

TL;DR: 这篇论文挑战了医学影像基础模型“不计成本扩大规模”的范式，介绍了CheXficient——一个通过主动、有原则的数据策展实现高效训练的胸片基础模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统医学影像基础模型的预训练遵循“不计成本扩大规模”的模式，但面临两个关键挑战：大规模医学数据集中存在大量冗余和严重类别不平衡，导致表征学习偏向于过度代表的模式；不考虑数据质量异质性的不加区别训练造成了大量计算效率低下。

Method: 研究引入了CheXficient胸片基础模型，采用主动、有原则的数据策展策略，在预训练过程中选择性优先训练信息丰富的样本。该模型仅使用了1,235,004对胸片图像和报告的22.7%数据进行训练，消耗不足总计算预算的27.3%。

Result: CheXficient在20个涵盖5种任务类型的基准测试中表现卓越，包括未经过适应调整的零样本发现分类和跨模态检索，以及经过适应的下游任务（疾病预测、语义分割和放射学报告生成）。分析表明，CheXficient能系统地优先考虑代表性不足的训练样本，提高了在长尾分布或罕见病症上的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这项研究表明，通过主动数据策展进行预训练可以成为蛮力扩大数据集规模的可行的、经济高效的替代方案，为医学视觉语言基础模型的高效预训练和下游适应提供了关于数据与计算需求的实用见解。

Abstract: Foundation models for medical imaging are typically pretrained on increasingly large datasets, following a "scale-at-all-costs" paradigm. However, this strategy faces two critical challenges: large-scale medical datasets often contain substantial redundancy and severe class imbalance that bias representation learning toward over-represented patterns, and indiscriminate training regardless of heterogeneity in data quality incurs considerable computational inefficiency. Here we demonstrate that active, principled data curation during pretraining can serve as a viable, cost-effective alternative to brute-force dataset enlargement. We introduce CheXficient, a chest X-ray (CXR) foundation model that selectively prioritizes informative training samples. CheXficient is pretrained on only 22.7% of 1,235,004 paired CXR images and reports while consuming under 27.3% of the total compute budget, yet achieving comparable or superior performance to its full-data counterpart and other large-scale pretrained models. We assess CheXficient across 20 individual benchmarks spanning 5 task types, including non-adapted off-the-shelf evaluations (zero-shot findings classification and crossmodal retrieval) and adapted downstream tasks (disease prediction, semantic segmentation, and radiology report generation). Further analyses show that CheXficient systematically prioritizes under-represented training samples, improving generalizability on long-tailed or rare conditions. Overall, our work offers practical insights into the data and computation demands for efficient pretraining and downstream adaptation of medical vision-language foundation models.

*Qinfeng Zhu,Yunxi Jiang,Lei Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 介绍SO3UFormer：一种针对全景语义分割的旋转鲁棒架构，通过内在特征表示、四元一致球面注意力和规范感知相对位置编码来解决重力对齐假设失效问题，在强旋转扰动下保持稳定性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的全景语义分割模型都基于严格的重力对齐假设，但实际应用中相机常常会因为手持抖动、无人机姿态变化等因素而偏离这个坐标系，这种偏差会导致传统球形Transformer过度依赖全局纬度线索，在三维旋转下表现崩溃。

Method: 提出了SO3UFormer，该方法基于三个几何支柱：1)消除了绝对纬度编码的内在特征表示，使特征与重力方向解耦；2)考虑了非均匀采样密度的四元一致球面注意力；3)使用切平面投影角度和离散规范聚合的规范感知相对位置编码机制。

Result: 所提出的方法在旋转稳定性方面表现优异：在Pose35数据集上达到72.03 mIoU，在任意全SO(3)旋转下仍保持70.67 mIoU，而基准SphereUFormer在同样条件下从67.53 mIoU降至25.26 mIoU，出现了灾难性失效。

Conclusion: SO3UFormer通过几何上精心设计的架构，实现了对三维旋转的高度鲁棒性全景语义分割，为解决实际应用中常见的相机方向变化问题提供了一个有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Panoramic semantic segmentation models are typically trained under a strict gravity-aligned assumption. However, real-world captures often deviate from this canonical orientation due to unconstrained camera motions, such as the rotational jitter of handheld devices or the dynamic attitude shifts of aerial platforms. This discrepancy causes standard spherical Transformers to overfit global latitude cues, leading to performance collapse under 3D reorientations. To address this, we introduce SO3UFormer, a rotation-robust architecture designed to learn intrinsic spherical features that are less sensitive to the underlying coordinate frame. Our approach rests on three geometric pillars: (1) an intrinsic feature formulation that decouples the representation from the gravity vector by removing absolute latitude encoding; (2) quadrature-consistent spherical attention that accounts for non-uniform sampling densities; and (3) a gauge-aware relative positional mechanism that encodes local angular geometry using tangent-plane projected angles and discrete gauge pooling, avoiding reliance on global axes. We further use index-based spherical resampling together with a logit-level SO(3)-consistency regularizer during training. To rigorously benchmark robustness, we introduce Pose35, a dataset variant of Stanford2D3D perturbed by random rotations within $\pm 35^\circ$. Under the extreme test of arbitrary full SO(3) rotations, existing SOTAs fail catastrophically: the baseline SphereUFormer drops from 67.53 mIoU to 25.26 mIoU. In contrast, SO3UFormer demonstrates remarkable stability, achieving 72.03 mIoU on Pose35 and retaining 70.67 mIoU under full SO(3) rotations.

Abstract: A clinically actionable Cardiac Digital Twin (CDT) should reconstruct individualised cardiac anatomy and physiology, update its internal state from multimodal signals, and enable a broad range of downstream simulations beyond isolated tasks. However, existing CDT frameworks remain limited to task-specific predictors rather than building a patient-specific, manipulable virtual heart. In this work, we introduce Chain of Flow (COF), a foundational ECG-driven generative framework that reconstructs full 4D cardiac structure and motion from a single cardiac cycle. The method integrates cine-CMR and 12-lead ECG during training to learn a unified representation of cardiac geometry, electrophysiology, and motion dynamics. We evaluate Chain of Flow on diverse cohorts and demonstrate accurate recovery of cardiac anatomy, chamber-wise function, and dynamic motion patterns. The reconstructed 4D hearts further support downstream CDT tasks such as volumetry, regional function analysis, and virtual cine synthesis. By enabling full 4D organ reconstruction directly from ECG, COF transforms cardiac digital twins from narrow predictive models into fully generative, patient-specific virtual hearts. Code will be released after review.

Abstract: Although deep learning has significantly advanced the perception capabilities of intelligent transportation systems, railway applications continue to suffer from a scarcity of high-quality, annotated data for safety-critical tasks like obstacle detection. While photorealistic simulators offer a solution, they often struggle with the ``sim-to-real" gap; conversely, simple image-masking techniques lack the spatio-temporal coherence required to obtain augmented single- and multi-frame scenes with the correct appearance and dimensions. This paper introduces a multi-modal augmented reality framework designed to bridge this gap by integrating photorealistic virtual objects into real-world railway sequences from the OSDaR23 dataset. Utilizing Unreal Engine 5 features, our pipeline leverages LiDAR point-clouds and INS/GNSS data to ensure accurate object placement and temporal stability across RGB frames. This paper also proposes a segmentation-based refinement strategy for INS/GNSS data to significantly improve the realism of the augmented sequences, as confirmed by the comparative study presented in the paper. Carefully designed augmented sequences are collected to produce OSDaR-AR, a public dataset designed to support the development of next-generation railway perception systems.

Abstract: While autonomous navigation has achieved remarkable success in passive perception (e.g., object detection and segmentation), it remains fundamentally constrained by a void in knowledge-driven, interactive environmental cognition. In the high-stakes domain of maritime navigation, the ability to bridge the gap between raw visual perception and complex cognitive reasoning is not merely an enhancement but a critical prerequisite for Autonomous Surface Vessels to execute safe and precise maneuvers. To this end, we present WaterVideoQA, the first large-scale, comprehensive Video Question Answering benchmark specifically engineered for all-waterway environments. This benchmark encompasses 3,029 video clips across six distinct waterway categories, integrating multifaceted variables such as volatile lighting and dynamic weather to rigorously stress-test ASV capabilities across a five-tier hierarchical cognitive framework. Furthermore, we introduce NaviMind, a pioneering multi-agent neuro-symbolic system designed for open-ended maritime reasoning. By synergizing Adaptive Semantic Routing, Situation-Aware Hierarchical Reasoning, and Autonomous Self-Reflective Verification, NaviMind transitions ASVs from superficial pattern matching to regulation-compliant, interpretable decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework significantly transcends existing baselines, establishing a new paradigm for intelligent, trustworthy interaction in dynamic maritime environments.

Abstract: Efficiently understanding long-form videos remains a fundamental challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). In this paper, we present MLLM-Sampler Joint Evolution (MSJoE), a novel framework that jointly evolves the MLLM and a lightweight key-frame sampler for efficient long-form video understanding. MSJoE builds upon a key assumption that only a small subset of key-frames is truly informative for answering each question to a video. Specifically, MSJoE first reasons out several queries, which describe diverse visual perspectives relevant to the question. Then, these queries interact with a frozen CLIP model to produce a query-frame similarity matrix. Finally, a lightweight sampler predicts key-frame sampling weights from this matrix, selecting a compact set of informative frames, which are then fed into the MLLM for answer generation. Both the MLLM and sampler are jointly optimized through reinforcement learning, enabling co-adaptation of query-reasoning, frame-sampling, and key-frame understanding. A new long-video QA dataset containing 2.8K videos with 7K question-answer pairs is collected to support the training process. Extensive experiments on VideoMME, LongVideoBench, LVBench, and MLVU show that MSJoE achieves 8.0\% accuracy gain upon the base MLLM, and 1.1\% higher accuracy than strongest baseline method.

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning has demonstrated promising results across various visual adaptation tasks, such as classification and segmentation. Typically, prompt tuning techniques have harnessed knowledge from a single pre-trained model, whether from a general or a specialized medical domain. However, this approach typically overlooks the potential synergies that could arise from integrating diverse domain knowledge within the same tuning process. In this work, we propose a novel Mixture-of-Experts prompt tuning method called pMoE, which leverages the strengths of multiple expert domains through expert-specialized prompt tokens and the learnable dispatcher, effectively combining their expertise in a unified model framework. Our pMoE introduces expert-specific prompt tokens and utilizes a dynamic token dispatching mechanism at various prompt layers to optimize the contribution of each domain expert during the adaptation phase. By incorporating both domain knowledge from diverse experts, the proposed pMoE significantly enhances the model's versatility and applicability to a broad spectrum of tasks. We conduct extensive experiments across 47 adaptation tasks, including both classification and segmentation in general and medical domains. The results demonstrate that our pMoE not only achieves superior performance with a large margin of improvements but also offers an optimal trade-off between computational efficiency and adaptation effectiveness compared to existing methods.

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive(VAR) models enhance generation quality but face a critical efficiency bottleneck in later stages. In this paper, we present a novel optimization framework for VAR models that fundamentally differs from prior approaches such as FastVAR and SkipVAR. Instead of relying on heuristic skipping strategies, our method leverages attention entropy to characterize the semantic projections across different dimensions of the model architecture. This enables precise identification of parameter dynamics under varying token granularity levels, semantic scopes, and generation scales. Building on this analysis, we further uncover sparsity patterns along three critical dimensions-token, layer, and scale-and propose a set of fine-grained optimization strategies tailored to these patterns. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that our approach achieves aggressive acceleration of the generation process while significantly preserving semantic fidelity and fine details, outperforming traditional methods in both efficiency and quality. Experiments on Infinity-2B and Infinity-8B models demonstrate that ToProVAR achieves up to 3.4x acceleration with minimal quality loss, effectively mitigating the issues found in prior work. Our code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Fingerspelling is a component of sign languages in which words are spelled out letter by letter using specific hand poses. Automatic fingerspelling recognition plays a crucial role in bridging the communication gap between Deaf and hearing communities, yet it remains challenging due to the signing-hand ambiguity issue, the lack of appropriate training losses, and the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem. Prior fingerspelling recognition methods rely on explicit signing-hand detection, which often leads to recognition failures, and on a connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss, which exhibits the peaky behavior problem. To address these issues, we develop OpenFS, an open-source approach for fingerspelling recognition and synthesis. We propose a multi-hand-capable fingerspelling recognizer that supports both single- and multi-hand inputs and performs implicit signing-hand detection by incorporating a dual-level positional encoding and a signing-hand focus (SF) loss. The SF loss encourages cross-attention to focus on the signing hand, enabling implicit signing-hand detection during recognition. Furthermore, without relying on the CTC loss, we introduce a monotonic alignment (MA) loss that enforces the output letter sequence to follow the temporal order of the input pose sequence through cross-attention regularization. In addition, we propose a frame-wise letter-conditioned generator that synthesizes realistic fingerspelling pose sequences for OOV words. This generator enables the construction of a new synthetic benchmark, called FSNeo. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in recognition and validate the effectiveness of the proposed recognizer and generator.

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor diagnosis requires models to not only detect lesions but also generate clinically interpretable reasoning grounded in imaging manifestations, yet existing public datasets remain limited in annotation richness and diagnostic semantics. To bridge this gap, we introduce MM-NeuroOnco, a large-scale multimodal benchmark and instruction-tuning dataset for brain tumor MRI understanding, consisting of 24,726 MRI slices from 20 data sources paired with approximately 200,000 semantically enriched multimodal instructions spanning diverse tumor subtypes and imaging modalities. To mitigate the scarcity and high cost of diagnostic semantic annotations, we develop a multi-model collaborative pipeline for automated medical information completion and quality control, enabling the generation of diagnosis-related semantics beyond mask-only annotations. Building upon this dataset, we further construct MM-NeuroOnco-Bench, a manually annotated evaluation benchmark with a rejection-aware setting to reduce biases inherent in closed-ended question formats. Evaluation across ten representative models shows that even the strongest baseline, Gemini 3 Flash, achieves only 41.88% accuracy on diagnosis-related questions, highlighting the substantial challenges of multimodal brain tumor diagnostic understanding. Leveraging MM-NeuroOnco, we further propose NeuroOnco-GPT, which achieves a 27% absolute accuracy improvement on diagnostic questions following fine-tuning. This result demonstrates the effectiveness of our dataset and benchmark in advancing clinically grounded multimodal diagnostic reasoning.

Abstract: World models based on video generation demonstrate remarkable potential for simulating interactive environments but face persistent difficulties in two key areas: maintaining long-term content consistency when scenes are revisited and enabling precise camera control from user-provided inputs. Existing methods based on explicit 3D reconstruction often compromise flexibility in unbounded scenarios and fine-grained structures. Alternative methods rely directly on previously generated frames without establishing explicit spatial correspondence, thereby constraining controllability and consistency. To address these limitations, we present UCM, a novel framework that unifies long-term memory and precise camera control via a time-aware positional encoding warping mechanism. To reduce computational overhead, we design an efficient dual-stream diffusion transformer for high-fidelity generation. Moreover, we introduce a scalable data curation strategy utilizing point-cloud-based rendering to simulate scene revisiting, facilitating training on over 500K monocular videos. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that UCM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in long-term scene consistency, while also achieving precise camera controllability in high-fidelity video generation.

Abstract: Detecting visual anomalies in industrial inspection often requires training with only a few normal images per category. Recent few-shot methods achieve strong results employing foundation-model features, but typically rely on memory banks, auxiliary datasets, or multi-modal tuning of vision-language models. We therefore question whether such complexity is necessary given the feature representations of vision foundation models. To answer this question, we introduce SubspaceAD, a training-free method, that operates in two simple stages. First, patch-level features are extracted from a small set of normal images by a frozen DINOv2 backbone. Second, a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) model is fit to these features to estimate the low-dimensional subspace of normal variations. At inference, anomalies are detected via the reconstruction residual with respect to this subspace, producing interpretable and statistically grounded anomaly scores. Despite its simplicity, SubspaceAD achieves state-of-the-art performance across one-shot and few-shot settings without training, prompt tuning, or memory banks. In the one-shot anomaly detection setting, SubspaceAD achieves image-level and pixel-level AUROC of 98.0% and 97.6% on the MVTec-AD dataset, and 93.3% and 98.3% on the VisA dataset, respectively, surpassing prior state-of-the-art results.

Abstract: Image alignment is a fundamental task in computer vision with broad applications. Existing methods predominantly employ optical flow-based image warping. However, this technique is susceptible to common challenges such as occlusions and illumination variations, leading to degraded alignment visual quality and compromised accuracy in downstream tasks. In this paper, we present DMAligner, a diffusion-based framework for image alignment through alignment-oriented view synthesis. DMAligner is crafted to tackle the challenges in image alignment from a new perspective, employing a generation-based solution that showcases strong capabilities and avoids the problems associated with flow-based image warping. Specifically, we propose a Dynamics-aware Diffusion Training approach for learning conditional image generation, synthesizing a novel view for image alignment. This incorporates a Dynamics-aware Mask Producing (DMP) module to adaptively distinguish dynamic foreground regions from static backgrounds, enabling the diffusion model to more effectively handle challenges that classical methods struggle to solve. Furthermore, we develop the Dynamic Scene Image Alignment (DSIA) dataset using Blender, which includes 1,033 indoor and outdoor scenes with over 30K image pairs tailored for image alignment. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach on DSIA benchmarks, as well as on a series of widely-used video datasets for qualitative comparisons.

*Tianyue Wang,Leigang Qu,Tianyu Yang,Xiangzhao Hao,Yifan Xu,Haiyun Guo,Jinqiao Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了WISER框架，这是一个无需训练的方法，将文本到图像（T2I）和图像到图像（I2I）检索统一起来，通过'检索-验证-精炼'流程提升零样本组合图像检索（ZS-CIR）的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ZS-CIR方法通常将多模态查询转换为单一模态（文本或图像），但这两种范式各自存在固有缺陷：T2I容易丢失视觉细节，而I2I难以处理复杂的语义修改。需要一种能有效结合两者优势的方法来处理多样化的查询意图。

Method: 提出WISER框架，其核心是'retrieve-verify-refine'流程：1）生成编辑后的标题和图像进行并行检索以扩大候选池；2）通过验证器评估检索置信度，对不确定结果触发精炼，对可靠结果进行动态融合；3）对不确定检索生成结构化的自我反思建议来指导后续检索。

Result: 在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法，在CIRCO（mAP@5）和CIRR（Recall@1）上分别相对提升了45%和57%。值得注意的是，其性能甚至超过了许多需要训练的方法。

Conclusion: WISER有效地统一了T2I和I2I范式，通过意图感知和不确定性感知机制，在零样本设置下实现了卓越的组合图像检索性能，具有很好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR) aims to retrieve target images given a multimodal query (comprising a reference image and a modification text), without training on annotated triplets. Existing methods typically convert the multimodal query into a single modality-either as an edited caption for Text-to-Image retrieval (T2I) or as an edited image for Image-to-Image retrieval (I2I). However, each paradigm has inherent limitations: T2I often loses fine-grained visual details, while I2I struggles with complex semantic modifications. To effectively leverage their complementary strengths under diverse query intents, we propose WISER, a training-free framework that unifies T2I and I2I via a "retrieve-verify-refine" pipeline, explicitly modeling intent awareness and uncertainty awareness. Specifically, WISER first performs Wider Search by generating both edited captions and images for parallel retrieval to broaden the candidate pool. Then, it conducts Adaptive Fusion with a verifier to assess retrieval confidence, triggering refinement for uncertain retrievals, and dynamically fusing the dual-path for reliable ones. For uncertain retrievals, WISER generates refinement suggestions through structured self-reflection to guide the next retrieval round toward Deeper Thinking. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WISER significantly outperforms previous methods across multiple benchmarks, achieving relative improvements of 45% on CIRCO (mAP@5) and 57% on CIRR (Recall@1) over existing training-free methods. Notably, it even surpasses many training-dependent methods, highlighting its superiority and generalization under diverse scenarios. Code will be released at https://github.com/Physicsmile/WISER.

Abstract: Detecting objects in aerial images confronts some significant challenges, including small size, dense and non-uniform distribution of objects over high-resolution images, which makes detection inefficient. Thus, in this paper, we proposed a small object detection algorithm based on a Spatial Laplacian Pyramid Attention and Multi-Scale Feature Enhancement in aerial images. Firstly, in order to improve the feature representation of ResNet-50 on small objects, we presented a novel Spatial Laplacian Pyramid Attention (SLPA) module, which is integrated after each stage of ResNet-50 to identify and emphasize important local regions. Secondly, to enhance the model's semantic understanding and features representation, we designed a Multi-Scale Feature Enhancement Module (MSFEM), which is incorporated into the lateral connections of C5 layer for building Feature Pyramid Network (FPN). Finally, the features representation quality of traditional feature pyramid network will be affected because the features are not aligned when the upper and lower layers are fused. In order to handle it, we utilized deformable convolutions to align the features in the fusion processing of the upper and lower levels of the Feature Pyramid Network, which can help enhance the model's ability to detect and recognize small objects. The extensive experimental results on two benchmark datasets: VisDrone and DOTA demonstrate that our improved model performs better for small object detection in aerial images compared to the original algorithm.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Volumetric videos offer immersive 4D experiences, but remain difficult to reconstruct, store, and stream at scale. Existing Gaussian Splatting based methods achieve high-quality reconstruction but break down on long sequences, temporal inconsistency, and fail under large motions and disocclusions. Moreover, their outputs are typically incompatible with conventional video coding pipelines, preventing practical applications.
  We introduce PackUV, a novel 4D Gaussian representation that maps all Gaussian attributes into a sequence of structured, multi-scale UV atlas, enabling compact, image-native storage. To fit this representation from multi-view videos, we propose PackUV-GS, a temporally consistent fitting method that directly optimizes Gaussian parameters in the UV domain. A flow-guided Gaussian labeling and video keyframing module identifies dynamic Gaussians, stabilizes static regions, and preserves temporal coherence even under large motions and disocclusions. The resulting UV atlas format is the first unified volumetric video representation compatible with standard video codecs (e.g., FFV1) without losing quality, enabling efficient streaming within existing multimedia infrastructure.
  To evaluate long-duration volumetric capture, we present PackUV-2B, the largest multi-view video dataset to date, featuring more than 50 synchronized cameras, substantial motion, and frequent disocclusions across 100 sequences and 2B (billion) frames. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses existing baselines in rendering fidelity while scaling to sequences up to 30 minutes with consistent quality.

Conclusion: D-FINE-seg是一种高效的Transformer实时实例分割架构，提供了完整的端到端处理流程，并以开源形式发布，有助于推动实时实例分割的发展。

Abstract: Transformer-based real-time object detectors achieve strong accuracy-latency trade-offs, and D-FINE is among the top-performing recent architectures. However, real-time instance segmentation with transformers is still less common. We present D-FINE-seg, an instance segmentation extension of D-FINE that adds: a lightweight mask head, segmentation-aware training, including box cropped BCE and dice mask losses, auxiliary and denoising mask supervision, and adapted Hungarian matching cost. On the TACO dataset, D-FINE-seg improves F1-score over Ultralytics YOLO26 under a unified TensorRT FP16 end-to-end benchmarking protocol, while maintaining competitive latency. Second contribution is an end-to-end pipeline for training, exporting, and optimized inference across ONNX, TensorRT, OpenVINO for both object detection and instance segmentation tasks.

Abstract: Energy-based predictive world models provide a powerful approach for multi-step visual planning by reasoning over latent energy landscapes rather than generating pixels. However, existing approaches face two major challenges: (i) their latent representations are typically learned in Euclidean space, neglecting the underlying geometric and hierarchical structure among states, and (ii) they struggle with long-horizon prediction, which leads to rapid degradation across extended rollouts. To address these challenges, we introduce GeoWorld, a geometric world model that preserves geometric structure and hierarchical relations through a Hyperbolic JEPA, which maps latent representations from Euclidean space onto hyperbolic manifolds. We further introduce Geometric Reinforcement Learning for energy-based optimization, enabling stable multi-step planning in hyperbolic latent space. Extensive experiments on CrossTask and COIN demonstrate around 3% SR improvement in 3-step planning and 2% SR improvement in 4-step planning compared to the state-of-the-art V-JEPA 2.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Foundation models increasingly offer potential to support interactive, agentic workflows that assist researchers during analysis and interpretation of image data. Such workflows often require coupling vision to language to provide a natural-language interface. However, paired image-text data needed to learn this coupling are scarce and difficult to obtain in many research and clinical settings. One such setting is microscopic analysis of cell-body-stained histological human brain sections, which enables the study of cytoarchitecture: cell density and morphology and their laminar and areal organization. Here, we propose a label-mediated method that generates meaningful captions from images by linking images and text only through a label, without requiring curated paired image-text data. Given the label, we automatically mine area descriptions from related literature and use them as synthetic captions reflecting canonical cytoarchitectonic attributes. An existing cytoarchitectonic vision foundation model (CytoNet) is then coupled to a large language model via an image-to-text training objective, enabling microscopy regions to be described in natural language. Across 57 brain areas, the resulting method produces plausible area-level descriptions and supports open-set use through explicit rejection of unseen areas. It matches the cytoarchitectonic reference label for in-scope patches with 90.6% accuracy and, with the area label masked, its descriptions remain discriminative enough to recover the area in an 8-way test with 68.6% accuracy. These results suggest that weak, label-mediated pairing can suffice to connect existing biomedical vision foundation models to language, providing a practical recipe for integrating natural-language in domains where fine-grained paired annotations are scarce.

Motivation: 现有状态空间模型（如Vision Mamba）在一维序列化处理时弱化了局部空间连续性和高频表示能力，而医学图像分割需要同时建模全局解剖结构和细粒度边界细节。

Method: 设计频谱分解与建模（SDM）模块，使用离散余弦变换分解低频和高频特征；低频通过频率域Mamba建模全局上下文，高频保留边界敏感细节；引入频谱通道重加权（SCR）机制和频谱引导融合（SGF）模块实现自适应多尺度融合。

Result: 在五个公共基准测试中展示了在不同模态和分割目标上的一致改进，验证了方法的有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 所提出的频率解耦框架在医学图像分割中能有效平衡全局结构建模和局部细节保留，为多尺度特征学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Accurate medical image segmentation requires effective modeling of both global anatomical structures and fine-grained boundary details. Recent state space models (e.g., Vision Mamba) offer efficient long-range dependency modeling. However, their one-dimensional serialization weakens local spatial continuity and high-frequency representation. To this end, we propose SpectralMamba-UNet, a novel frequency-disentangled framework to decouple the learning of structural and textural information in the spectral domain. Our Spectral Decomposition and Modeling (SDM) module applies discrete cosine transform to decompose low- and high-frequency features, where low frequency contributes to global contextual modeling via a frequency-domain Mamba and high frequency preserves boundary-sensitive details. To balance spectral contributions, we introduce a Spectral Channel Reweighting (SCR) mechanism to form channel-wise frequency-aware attention, and a Spectral-Guided Fusion (SGF) module to achieve adaptively multi-scale fusion in the decoder. Experiments on five public benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements across diverse modalities and segmentation targets, validating the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

Conclusion: WARM-CAT方法通过多模态知识积累和自适应原型更新，有效解决了CZSL中的分布偏移问题，在多个数据集上验证了其优越性。

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones. Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge, we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire visual prototypes from historical images for inference. Since the model tends to favor compositions already stored in the queue during testing, we warm-start the queue by initializing it with training images for visual prototypes of seen compositions and generating unseen visual prototypes using the mapping learned between seen and unseen textual prototypes. Considering the semantic consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by multimodal collaborative representation learning. To provide a more reliable evaluation for CZSL, we introduce a new benchmark dataset, C-Fashion, and refine the widely used but noisy MIT-States dataset. Extensive experiments indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于单位球体Hough变换的新方法来估计相机航向，解决了现有方法在高噪声和高异常值环境下性能下降的问题，在精度和效率方面达到了Pareto前沿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于已知旋转（如IMU或优化算法）的相机航向估计方法在低噪声、低异常值条件下表现良好，但随着噪声和异常值水平增加，这些方法的准确性会下降或计算成本升高。需要一种更鲁棒且高效的方法来处理复杂环境下的相机运动估计问题。

Method: 提出了一种在单位球体(S(2))上推广Hough变换的方法：首先提取两帧间的特征对应点，为每对对应点生成一个兼容方向的大圆；然后使用斐波那契格点作为bin中心对单位球体进行离散化，每个大圆对一系列方向进行投票，确保不受噪声或动态物体影响的特征能一致地投票给正确的运动方向。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，该方法在精度与效率的权衡中达到了Pareto前沿。在SLAM实验上，通过校正相机位姿初始化时的航向，能够显著降低RMSE（均方根误差）。

Conclusion: 所提出的基于单位球体Hough变换的相机航向估计方法，能够有效处理噪声和异常值，在保持计算效率的同时提高了估计精度，特别是在SLAM系统的相机位姿初始化阶段表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Estimating camera motion from monocular video is a fundamental problem in computer vision, central to tasks such as SLAM, visual odometry, and structure-from-motion. Existing methods that recover the camera's heading under known rotation, whether from an IMU or an optimization algorithm, tend to perform well in low-noise, low-outlier conditions, but often decrease in accuracy or become computationally expensive as noise and outlier levels increase. To address these limitations, we propose a novel generalization of the Hough transform on the unit sphere (S(2)) to estimate the camera's heading. First, the method extracts correspondences between two frames and generates a great circle of directions compatible with each pair of correspondences. Then, by discretizing the unit sphere using a Fibonacci lattice as bin centers, each great circle casts votes for a range of directions, ensuring that features unaffected by noise or dynamic objects vote consistently for the correct motion direction. Experimental results on three datasets demonstrate that the proposed method is on the Pareto frontier of accuracy versus efficiency. Additionally, experiments on SLAM show that the proposed method reduces RMSE by correcting the heading during camera pose initialization.

Conclusion: 本文为基于迁移的对抗攻击研究提供了系统化的评估框架，有助于促进该领域的公平比较和标准化发展，文中还对图像分类之外的迁移攻击进行了简要回顾。

Abstract: Adversarial transferability refers to the capacity of adversarial examples generated on the surrogate model to deceive alternate, unexposed victim models. This property eliminates the need for direct access to the victim model during an attack, thereby raising considerable security concerns in practical applications and attracting substantial research attention recently. In this work, we discern a lack of a standardized framework and criteria for evaluating transfer-based attacks, leading to potentially biased assessments of existing approaches. To rectify this gap, we have conducted an exhaustive review of hundreds of related works, organizing various transfer-based attacks into six distinct categories. Subsequently, we propose a comprehensive framework designed to serve as a benchmark for evaluating these attacks. In addition, we delineate common strategies that enhance adversarial transferability and highlight prevalent issues that could lead to unfair comparisons. Finally, we provide a brief review of transfer-based attacks beyond image classification.

Despite recent progress, many approaches still rely on multi-stage pipelines or full fine-tuning of large backbones, which increases training cost, while the broader WSOL community continues to face the challenge of partial object coverage. We present TriLite, a single-stage WSOL framework that leverages a frozen Vision Transformer with Dinov2 pre-training in a self-supervised manner, and introduces only a minimal number of trainable parameters (fewer than 800K on ImageNet-1K) for both classification and localization. At its core is the proposed TriHead module, which decomposes patch features into foreground, background, and ambiguous regions, thereby improving object coverage while suppressing spurious activations. By disentangling classification and localization objectives, TriLite effectively exploits the universal representations learned by self-supervised ViTs without requiring expensive end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on CUB-200-2011, ImageNet-1K, and OpenImages demonstrate that TriLite sets a new state of the art, while remaining significantly more parameter-efficient and easier to train than prior methods. The code will be released soon.

Abstract: With the increasing demand for robust person Re-ID in unconstrained environments, learning from datasets with noisy labels and sparse per-identity samples remains a critical challenge. Existing noise-robust person Re-ID methods primarily rely on loss-correction or sample-selection strategies using softmax outputs. However, these methods suffer from two key limitations: 1) Softmax exhibits translation invariance, leading to over-confident and unreliable predictions on corrupted labels. 2) Conventional sample selection based on small-loss criteria often discards valuable hard positives that are crucial for learning discriminative features. To overcome these issues, we propose the CAlibration-to-REfinement (CARE) method, a two-stage framework that seeks certainty through probabilistic evidence propagation from calibration to refinement. In the calibration stage, we propose the probabilistic evidence calibration (PEC) that dismantles softmax translation invariance by injecting adaptive learnable parameters into the similarity function, and employs an evidential calibration loss to mitigate overconfidence on mislabeled samples. In the refinement stage, we design the evidence propagation refinement (EPR) that can more accurately distinguish between clean and noisy samples. Specifically, the EPR contains two steps: Firstly, the composite angular margin (CAM) metric is proposed to precisely distinguish clean but hard-to-learn positive samples from mislabeled ones in a hyperspherical space; Secondly, the certainty-oriented sphere weighting (COSW) is developed to dynamically allocate the importance of samples according to CAM, ensuring clean instances drive model updates. Extensive experimental results on Market1501, DukeMTMC-ReID, and CUHK03 datasets under both random and patterned noises show that CARE achieves competitive performance.

<details>

Motivation: 传统基于深度学习的稳像方法需要配对稳定/不稳定数据集，存在数据有限、可控性差、硬件资源受限时效率低等问题。现有基准测试主要针对手持设备前向可见光视频，限制了在无人机夜间遥感等领域的适用性。

Method: 采用无监督框架，将经典稳像流程实例化为三个阶段，融入多线程缓冲机制。无需配对训练数据。同时提出了新的多模态无人机航拍视频数据集UAV-Test。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在定量指标和视觉质量上均优于当前最先进的在线稳像方法，且性能可与离线方法相媲美。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了传统端到端学习方法面临的数据限制、可控性差和硬件效率问题，为无人机夜间遥感等领域的视频稳像应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose a new unsupervised framework for online video stabilization. Unlike methods based on deep learning that require paired stable and unstable datasets, our approach instantiates the classical stabilization pipeline with three stages and incorporates a multithreaded buffering mechanism. This design addresses three longstanding challenges in end-to-end learning: limited data, poor controllability, and inefficiency on hardware with constrained resources. Existing benchmarks focus mainly on handheld videos with a forward view in visible light, which restricts the applicability of stabilization to domains such as UAV nighttime remote sensing. To fill this gap, we introduce a new multimodal UAV aerial video dataset (UAV-Test). Experiments show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art online stabilizers in both quantitative metrics and visual quality, while achieving performance comparable to offline methods.

TL;DR: Fase3D是一种创新的无编码器3D大语言模型，通过傅里叶变换和点云序列化处理无序3D数据，在保持性能的同时大幅提升效率和扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D多模态模型通常依赖繁重的预训练视觉编码器提取几何特征，这限制了效率和扩展性。虽然2D领域已开始移除编码器，但3D点云的无序性和大规模特性使得类似方法难以直接应用，需要解决如何有效且高效地标记化无序3D数据的问题。

Method: 提出Fase3D框架，包含三个关键技术：1) 通过结构化超点紧凑表示大规模场景；2) 使用空间填充曲线序列化配合快速傅里叶变换实现高效全局上下文建模和图状令牌合并；3) 通过傅里叶增强的LoRA适配器以极小成本向LLM注入全局频率感知交互。

Result: Fase3D在性能上达到与基于编码器的3D LMM相当的水平，同时在计算和参数方面显著更高效。

Conclusion: Fase3D证明了通过傅里叶变换有效处理无序3D数据的可行性，为构建高效且可扩展的3D视觉语言模型提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that process 3D data typically rely on heavy, pre-trained visual encoders to extract geometric features. While recent 2D LMMs have begun to eliminate such encoders for efficiency and scalability, extending this paradigm to 3D remains challenging due to the unordered and large-scale nature of point clouds. This leaves a critical unanswered question: How can we design an LMM that tokenizes unordered 3D data effectively and efficiently without a cumbersome encoder? We propose Fase3D, the first efficient encoder-free Fourier-based 3D scene LMM. Fase3D tackles the challenges of scalability and permutation invariance with a novel tokenizer that combines point cloud serialization and the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to approximate self-attention. This design enables an effective and computationally minimal architecture, built upon three key innovations: First, we represent large scenes compactly via structured superpoints. Second, our space-filling curve serialization followed by an FFT enables efficient global context modeling and graph-based token merging. Lastly, our Fourier-augmented LoRA adapters inject global frequency-aware interactions into the LLMs at a negligible cost. Fase3D achieves performance comparable to encoder-based 3D LMMs while being significantly more efficient in computation and parameters. Project website: https://tev-fbk.github.io/Fase3D.

TL;DR: DyaDiT是基于多模态扩散Transformer的新方法，能够从双人对话音频生成更自然、考虑社交上下文的手势动作，解决了现有方法忽略社交互动动态的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前的手势生成方法多为单人映射，缺乏对双人对话中社交上下文和相互动态的建模，这限制了数字人类交互的自然性和社交参与度

Method: 使用多模态扩散Transformer，输入双人对话音频和可选的社交上下文标记，融合双说话者信息以捕捉互动动态，采用运动字典编码运动先验，并可选择性利用对话伙伴的手势生成更响应的动作

Result: 在标准运动生成指标和用户定量研究中，DyaDiT不仅客观指标优于现有方法，而且用户强烈偏好其生成的手势，展现出鲁棒性和社交友好的运动生成能力

Conclusion: DyaDiT能够生成更具社交情境适应性的对话手势，通过建模双人互动动态提升了数字人类交互的自然度，在学术评估和用户体验两方面都表现出色

Abstract: Generating realistic conversational gestures are essential for achieving natural, socially engaging interactions with digital humans. However, existing methods typically map a single audio stream to a single speaker's motion, without considering social context or modeling the mutual dynamics between two people engaging in conversation. We present DyaDiT, a multi-modal diffusion transformer that generates contextually appropriate human motion from dyadic audio signals. Trained on Seamless Interaction Dataset, DyaDiT takes dyadic audio with optional social-context tokens to produce context-appropriate motion. It fuses information from both speakers to capture interaction dynamics, uses a motion dictionary to encode motion priors, and can optionally utilize the conversational partner's gestures to produce more responsive motion. We evaluate DyaDiT on standard motion generation metrics and conduct quantitative user studies, demonstrating that it not only surpasses existing methods on objective metrics but is also strongly preferred by users, highlighting its robustness and socially favorable motion generation. Code and models will be released upon acceptance.

Motivation: 现有多模态基准主要评估单轮视觉推理或特定工具技能，无法充分捕捉实际智能体所需的真实性、视觉细微差异和长时序工具使用，需要更全面的评估框架

Method: 构建涵盖7个类别25个子领域的综合性基准测试，包含真实丰富的视觉场景和自然混合工具使用任务，要求跨模态的长时序工具交互，包括网页搜索、图像搜索、页面导航以及图像处理和通用编程的代码操作

Result: 对最先进模型的全面评估显示它们在执行长时序多模态工具使用方面存在显著差距，Gemini-3-Pro with tools是表现最佳模型，但总体准确率仅为27.3%，困难实例可能需要超过25轮工具调用

Conclusion: AgentVista基准将加速更强大可靠的多模态智能体开发，以应对现实世界中极具挑战性的复杂问题解决任务，推动领域进步

Abstract: Real-world multimodal agents solve multi-step workflows grounded in visual evidence. For example, an agent can troubleshoot a device by linking a wiring photo to a schematic and validating the fix with online documentation, or plan a trip by interpreting a transit map and checking schedules under routing constraints. However, existing multimodal benchmarks mainly evaluate single-turn visual reasoning or specific tool skills, and they do not fully capture the realism, visual subtlety, and long-horizon tool use that practical agents require. We introduce AgentVista, a benchmark for generalist multimodal agents that spans 25 sub-domains across 7 categories, pairing realistic and detail-rich visual scenarios with natural hybrid tool use. Tasks require long-horizon tool interactions across modalities, including web search, image search, page navigation, and code-based operations for both image processing and general programming. Comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art models exposes significant gaps in their ability to carry out long-horizon multimodal tool use. Even the best model in our evaluation, Gemini-3-Pro with tools, achieves only 27.3% overall accuracy, and hard instances can require more than 25 tool-calling turns. We expect AgentVista to accelerate the development of more capable and reliable multimodal agents for realistic and ultra-challenging problem solving.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出BaryIR框架，通过Wasserstein重心对齐多源退化特征并引入残差子空间，将退化无关的共性内容与退化特定的知识解耦，从而提升图像复原模型对于分布外退化的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的统一图像复原模型在处理分布外退化时泛化能力有限。研究者基于直觉——多源退化特征分布是由不同退化特定偏移引起的，恢复退化无关的共享分布对于跨退化的泛化至关重要。

Method: 提出BaryIR框架：1）将多源退化特征对齐到Wasserstein重心空间，通过最小化到多源退化分布的平均Wasserstein距离来建模退化无关分布；2）引入残差子空间，其嵌入相互对比的同时与WB嵌入正交，从而明确解耦两个正交空间。

Result: BaryIR在综合实验中优于现有的统一图像复原方法，尤其在未见过的退化类型/级别上表现出优越的泛化能力，即使在有限退化类型上训练，也能在现实混合退化数据上保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: BaryIR通过解耦退化无关的共性空间与退化特定的残差空间，成功增强了图像复原模型对于分布外退化的泛化能力，为真实场景下的自适应修复提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Despite substantial advances in all-in-one image restoration for addressing diverse degradations within a unified model, existing methods remain vulnerable to out-of-distribution degradations, thereby limiting their generalization in real-world scenarios. To tackle the challenge, this work is motivated by the intuition that multisource degraded feature distributions are induced by different degradation-specific shifts from an underlying degradation-agnostic distribution, and recovering such a shared distribution is thus crucial for achieving generalization across degradations. With this insight, we propose BaryIR, a representation learning framework that aligns multisource degraded features in the Wasserstein barycenter (WB) space, which models a degradation-agnostic distribution by minimizing the average of Wasserstein distances to multisource degraded distributions. We further introduce residual subspaces, whose embeddings are mutually contrasted while remaining orthogonal to the WB embeddings. Consequently, BaryIR explicitly decouples two orthogonal spaces: a WB space that encodes the degradation-agnostic invariant contents shared across degradations, and residual subspaces that adaptively preserve the degradation-specific knowledge. This disentanglement mitigates overfitting to in-distribution degradations and enables adaptive restoration grounded on the degradation-agnostic shared invariance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BaryIR performs competitively against state-of-the-art all-in-one methods. Notably, BaryIR generalizes well to unseen degradations (\textit{e.g.,} types and levels) and shows remarkable robustness in learning generalized features, even when trained on limited degradation types and evaluated on real-world data with mixed degradations.

Abstract: Capturing 4D spatiotemporal surroundings is crucial for the safe and reliable operation of robots in dynamic environments. However, most existing methods address only one side of the problem: they either provide coarse geometric tracking via bounding boxes, or detailed 3D structures like voxel-based occupancy that lack explicit temporal association. In this work, we present Latent Gaussian Splatting for 4D Panoptic Occupancy Tracking (LaGS) that advances spatiotemporal scene understanding in a holistic direction. Our approach incorporates camera-based end-to-end tracking with mask-based multi-view panoptic occupancy prediction, and addresses the key challenge of efficiently aggregating multi-view information into 3D voxel grids via a novel latent Gaussian splatting approach. Specifically, we first fuse observations into 3D Gaussians that serve as a sparse point-centric latent representation of the 3D scene, and then splat the aggregated features onto a 3D voxel grid that is decoded by a mask-based segmentation head. We evaluate LaGS on the Occ3D nuScenes and Waymo datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance for 4D panoptic occupancy tracking. We make our code available at https://lags.cs.uni-freiburg.de/.

Abstract: Accurate, real-time crowd counting on railway platforms is essential for safety and capacity management. We propose to use a single camera mounted in a train, scanning the platform while arriving. While hardware constraints are simple, counting remains challenging due to dense occlusions, camera motion, and perspective distortions during train arrivals. Most existing tracking-by-detection approaches assume static cameras or ignore physical consistency in motion modeling, leading to unreliable counting under dynamic conditions. We propose a physics-constrained tracking framework that unifies detection, appearance, and 3D motion reasoning in a real-time pipeline. Our approach integrates a transfer-learned YOLOv11m detector with EfficientNet-B0 appearance encoding within DeepSORT, while introducing a physics-constrained Kalman model (Phys-3D) that enforces physically plausible 3D motion dynamics through pinhole geometry. To address counting brittleness under occlusions, we implement a virtual counting band with persistence. On our platform benchmark, MOT-RailwayPlatformCrowdHead Dataset(MOT-RPCH), our method reduces counting error to 2.97%, demonstrating robust performance despite motion and occlusions. Our results show that incorporating first-principles geometry and motion priors enables reliable crowd counting in safety-critical transportation scenarios, facilitating effective train scheduling and platform safety management.

Abstract: We propose Uni-Animator, a novel Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework for unified image and video sketch colorization. Existing sketch colorization methods struggle to unify image and video tasks, suffering from imprecise color transfer with single or multiple references, inadequate preservation of high-frequency physical details, and compromised temporal coherence with motion artifacts in large-motion scenes. To tackle imprecise color transfer, we introduce visual reference enhancement via instance patch embedding, enabling precise alignment and fusion of reference color information. To resolve insufficient physical detail preservation, we design physical detail reinforcement using physical features that effectively capture and retain high-frequency textures. To mitigate motion-induced temporal inconsistency, we propose sketch-based dynamic RoPE encoding that adaptively models motion-aware spatial-temporal dependencies. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Uni-Animator achieves competitive performance on both image and video sketch colorization, matching that of task-specific methods while unlocking unified cross-domain capabilities with high detail fidelity and robust temporal consistency.

Motivation: 结肠镜视频生成能为肠癌诊断提供丰富动态信息，但现有方法面临肠道结构不规则、疾病表现形式多样和成像模式多样的挑战，导致生成的视频时间一致性差且难以精确控制临床属性。为解决数据稀缺问题并辅助临床分析，需要开发能够生成高质量动态一致且属性可控的结肠镜视频的方法。

Conclusion: ColoDiff代表了可控结肠镜视频生成的重要进展，揭示了合成视频在补充真实数据表示和缓解临床数据稀缺方面的潜力，为临床环境中的数据分析提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Colonoscopy video generation delivers dynamic, information-rich data critical for diagnosing intestinal diseases, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. High-quality video generation demands temporal consistency and precise control over clinical attributes, but faces challenges from irregular intestinal structures, diverse disease representations, and various imaging modalities. To this end, we propose ColoDiff, a diffusion-based framework that generates dynamic-consistent and content-aware colonoscopy videos, aiming to alleviate data shortage and assist clinical analysis. At the inter-frame level, our TimeStream module decouples temporal dependency from video sequences through a cross-frame tokenization mechanism, enabling intricate dynamic modeling despite irregular intestinal structures. At the intra-frame level, our Content-Aware module incorporates noise-injected embeddings and learnable prototypes to realize precise control over clinical attributes, breaking through the coarse guidance of diffusion models. Additionally, ColoDiff employs a non-Markovian sampling strategy that cuts steps by over 90% for real-time generation. ColoDiff is evaluated across three public datasets and one hospital database, based on both generation metrics and downstream tasks including disease diagnosis, modality discrimination, bowel preparation scoring, and lesion segmentation. Extensive experiments show ColoDiff generates videos with smooth transitions and rich dynamics. ColoDiff presents an effort in controllable colonoscopy video generation, revealing the potential of synthetic videos in complementing authentic representation and mitigating data scarcity in clinical settings.

Conclusion: EmbodMocap为大规模采集场景条件下的真实人类动作数据提供了便携、经济的解决方案，推动了具身AI研究的发展。

Abstract: Human behaviors in the real world naturally encode rich, long-term contextual information that can be leveraged to train embodied agents for perception, understanding, and acting. However, existing capture systems typically rely on costly studio setups and wearable devices, limiting the large-scale collection of scene-conditioned human motion data in the wild. To address this, we propose EmbodMocap, a portable and affordable data collection pipeline using two moving iPhones. Our key idea is to jointly calibrate dual RGB-D sequences to reconstruct both humans and scenes within a unified metric world coordinate frame. The proposed method allows metric-scale and scene-consistent capture in everyday environments without static cameras or markers, bridging human motion and scene geometry seamlessly. Compared with optical capture ground truth, we demonstrate that the dual-view setting exhibits a remarkable ability to mitigate depth ambiguity, achieving superior alignment and reconstruction performance over single iphone or monocular models. Based on the collected data, we empower three embodied AI tasks: monocular human-scene-reconstruction, where we fine-tune on feedforward models that output metric-scale, world-space aligned humans and scenes; physics-based character animation, where we prove our data could be used to scale human-object interaction skills and scene-aware motion tracking; and robot motion control, where we train a humanoid robot via sim-to-real RL to replicate human motions depicted in videos. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our pipeline and its contributions towards advancing embodied AI research.

In this work, a computational framework was developed using the BrokenEyes system to simulate five common eye disorders: Age-related macular degeneration, cataract, glaucoma, refractive errors, and diabetic retinopathy and analyze their effects on neural-like feature representations in deep learning models. Leveraging a combination of human and non-human datasets, models trained under normal and disorder-specific conditions revealed critical disruptions in feature maps, particularly for cataract and glaucoma, which align with known neural processing challenges in these conditions. Evaluation metrics such as activation energy and cosine similarity quantified the severity of these distortions, providing insights into the interplay between degraded visual inputs and learned representations.

Abstract: This paper introduces Multidimensional Task Learning (MTL), a unified mathematical framework based on Generalized Einstein MLPs (GE-MLPs) that operate directly on tensors via the Einstein product. We argue that current computer vision task formulations are inherently constrained by matrix-based thinking: standard architectures rely on matrix-valued weights and vectorvalued biases, requiring structural flattening that restricts the space of naturally expressible tasks. GE-MLPs lift this constraint by operating with tensor-valued parameters, enabling explicit control over which dimensions are preserved or contracted without information loss. Through rigorous mathematical derivations, we demonstrate that classification, segmentation, and detection are special cases of MTL, differing only in their dimensional configuration within a formally defined task space. We further prove that this task space is strictly larger than what matrix-based formulations can natively express, enabling principled task configurations such as spatiotemporal or cross modal predictions that require destructive flattening under conventional approaches. This work provides a mathematical foundation for understanding, comparing, and designing computer vision tasks through the lens of tensor algebra.

Abstract: With the explosive growth of digital entertainment, automated video summarization has become indispensable for applications such as content indexing, personalized recommendation, and efficient media archiving. Automatic synopsis generation for long-form videos, such as movies and TV series, presents a significant challenge for existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs). While proficient at single-image captioning, these general-purpose models often exhibit critical failures in long-duration contexts, primarily a lack of ID-consistent character identification and a fractured narrative coherence. To overcome these limitations, we propose MovieTeller, a novel framework for generating movie synopses via tool-augmented progressive abstraction. Our core contribution is a training-free, tool-augmented, fact-grounded generation process. Instead of requiring costly model fine-tuning, our framework directly leverages off-the-shelf models in a plug-and-play manner. We first invoke a specialized face recognition model as an external "tool" to establish Factual Groundings--precise character identities and their corresponding bounding boxes. These groundings are then injected into the prompt to steer the VLM's reasoning, ensuring the generated scene descriptions are anchored to verifiable facts. Furthermore, our progressive abstraction pipeline decomposes the summarization of a full-length movie into a multi-stage process, effectively mitigating the context length limitations of current VLMs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach yields significant improvements in factual accuracy, character consistency, and overall narrative coherence compared to end-to-end baselines.

Abstract: Which multimodal model should we use for classification? Previous studies suggest that the answer lies in CLIP-like contrastive Vision-Language Models (VLMs), due to their remarkable performance in zero-shot classification. In contrast, Large Multimodal Models (LMM) are more suitable for complex tasks. In this work, we argue that this answer overlooks an important capability of LMMs: in-context learning. We benchmark state-of-the-art LMMs on diverse datasets for closed-world classification and find that, although their zero-shot performance is lower than CLIP's, LMMs with a few in-context examples can match or even surpass contrastive VLMs with cache-based adapters, their "in-context" equivalent. We extend this analysis to the open-world setting, where the generative nature of LMMs makes them more suitable for the task. In this challenging scenario, LMMs struggle whenever provided with imperfect context information. To address this issue, we propose CIRCLE, a simple training-free method that assigns pseudo-labels to in-context examples, iteratively refining them with the available context itself. Through extensive experiments, we show that CIRCLE establishes a robust baseline for open-world classification, surpassing VLM counterparts and highlighting the potential of LMMs to serve as unified classifiers, and a flexible alternative to specialized models.

Abstract: Human action recognition plays an important role when developing intelligent interactions between humans and machines. While there is a lot of active research on improving the machine learning algorithms for skeleton-based action recognition, not much attention has been given to the quality of the input skeleton data itself. This work demonstrates that by making use of multiple camera views to triangulate more accurate 3D~skeletons, the performance of state-of-the-art action recognition models can be improved significantly. This suggests that the quality of the input data is currently a limiting factor for the performance of these models. Based on these results, it is argued that the cost-benefit ratio of using multiple cameras is very favorable in most practical use-cases, therefore future research in skeleton-based action recognition should consider multi-view applications as the standard setup.

Abstract: Pure-vision GUI agents provide universal interaction capabilities but suffer from severe efficiency bottlenecks due to the massive spatiotemporal redundancy inherent in high-resolution screenshots and historical trajectories. We identify two critical misalignments in existing compression paradigms: the temporal mismatch, where uniform history encoding diverges from the agent's "fading memory" attention pattern, and the spatial topology conflict, where unstructured pruning compromises the grid integrity required for precise coordinate grounding, inducing spatial hallucinations. To address these challenges, we introduce GUIPruner, a training-free framework tailored for high-resolution GUI navigation. It synergizes Temporal-Adaptive Resolution (TAR), which eliminates historical redundancy via decay-based resizing, and Stratified Structure-aware Pruning (SSP), which prioritizes interactive foregrounds and semantic anchors while safeguarding global layout. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that GUIPruner consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, effectively preventing the collapse observed in large-scale models under high compression. Notably, on Qwen2-VL-2B, our method delivers a 3.4x reduction in FLOPs and a 3.3x speedup in vision encoding latency while retaining over 94% of the original performance, enabling real-time, high-precision navigation with minimal resource consumption.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于小波变换的谱差分隐私框架，通过分离图像的低频隐私敏感分量和高频通用分量，在保护隐私的同时提升生成图像质量。

Conclusion: 基于谱分解的差分隐私框架通过将隐私预算集中在低频结构信息，而将高频细节处理为公开通用成分，在保持强隐私保证的同时显著提升了生成图像质量。

Abstract: Generative models trained on sensitive image datasets risk memorizing and reproducing individual training examples, making strong privacy guarantees essential. While differential privacy (DP) provides a principled framework for such guarantees, standard DP finetuning (e.g., with DP-SGD) often results in severe degradation of image quality, particularly in high-frequency textures, due to the indiscriminate addition of noise across all model parameters. In this work, we propose a spectral DP framework based on the hypothesis that the most privacy-sensitive portions of an image are often low-frequency components in the wavelet space (e.g., facial features and object shapes) while high-frequency components are largely generic and public. Based on this hypothesis, we propose the following two-stage framework for DP image generation with coarse image intermediaries: (1) DP finetune an autoregressive spectral image tokenizer model on the low-resolution wavelet coefficients of the sensitive images, and (2) perform high-resolution upsampling using a publicly pretrained super-resolution model. By restricting the privacy budget to the global structures of the image in the first stage, and leveraging the post-processing property of DP for detail refinement, we achieve promising trade-offs between privacy and utility. Experiments on the MS-COCO and MM-CelebA-HQ datasets show that our method generates images with improved quality and style capture relative to other leading DP image frameworks.

Abstract: Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining enables precise molecular profiling of protein expression, with over 200 clinically available antibody-based tests in modern pathology. However, comprehensive IHC analysis is frequently limited by insufficient tissue quantities in small biopsies. Therefore, virtual multiplex staining emerges as an innovative solution to digitally transform H&E images into multiple IHC representations, yet current methods still face three critical challenges: (1) inadequate semantic guidance for multi-staining, (2) inconsistent distribution of immunochemistry staining, and (3) spatial misalignment across different stain modalities. To overcome these limitations, we present a prompt-guided framework for virtual multiplex IHC staining using only uniplex training data (PGVMS). Our framework introduces three key innovations corresponding to each challenge: First, an adaptive prompt guidance mechanism employing a pathological visual language model dynamically adjusts staining prompts to resolve semantic guidance limitations (Challenge 1). Second, our protein-aware learning strategy (PALS) maintains precise protein expression patterns by direct quantification and constraint of protein distributions (Challenge 2). Third, the prototype-consistent learning strategy (PCLS) establishes cross-image semantic interaction to correct spatial misalignments (Challenge 3).

Abstract: In real scenarios, videos can span several minutes or even hours. However, existing research on spatio-temporal video grounding (STVG), given a textual query, mainly focuses on localizing targets in short videos of tens of seconds, typically less than one minute, which limits real-world applications. In this paper, we explore Long-Form STVG (LF-STVG), which aims to locate targets in long-term videos. Compared with short videos, long-term videos contain much longer temporal spans and more irrelevant information, making it difficult for existing STVG methods that process all frames at once. To address this challenge, we propose an AutoRegressive Transformer architecture for LF-STVG, termed ART-STVG. Unlike conventional STVG methods that require the entire video sequence to make predictions at once, ART-STVG treats the video as streaming input and processes frames sequentially, enabling efficient handling of long videos. To model spatio-temporal context, we design spatial and temporal memory banks and apply them to the decoders. Since memories from different moments are not always relevant to the current frame, we introduce simple yet effective memory selection strategies to provide more relevant information to the decoders, significantly improving performance. Furthermore, instead of parallel spatial and temporal localization, we propose a cascaded spatio-temporal design that connects the spatial decoder to the temporal decoder, allowing fine-grained spatial cues to assist complex temporal localization in long videos. Experiments on newly extended LF-STVG datasets show that ART-STVG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while achieving competitive performance on conventional short-form STVG.

Conclusion: ManifoldGD是首个几何感知的无训练数据蒸馏框架，通过流形一致指导在保持语义一致性的同时，显著提升合成数据的代表性、多样性和图像保真度

Abstract: In recent times, large datasets hinder efficient model training while also containing redundant concepts. Dataset distillation aims to synthesize compact datasets that preserve the knowledge of large-scale training sets while drastically reducing storage and computation. Recent advances in diffusion models have enabled training-free distillation by leveraging pre-trained generative priors; however, existing guidance strategies remain limited. Current score-based methods either perform unguided denoising or rely on simple mode-based guidance toward instance prototype centroids (IPC centroids), which often are rudimentary and suboptimal. We propose Manifold-Guided Distillation (ManifoldGD), a training-free diffusion-based framework that integrates manifold consistent guidance at every denoising timestep. Our method employs IPCs computed via a hierarchical, divisive clustering of VAE latent features, yielding a multi-scale coreset of IPCs that captures both coarse semantic modes and fine intra-class variability. Using a local neighborhood of the extracted IPC centroids, we create the latent manifold for each diffusion denoising timestep. At each denoising step, we project the mode-alignment vector onto the local tangent space of the estimated latent manifold, thus constraining the generation trajectory to remain manifold-faithful while preserving semantic consistency. This formulation improves representativeness, diversity, and image fidelity without requiring any model retraining. Empirical results demonstrate consistent gains over existing training-free and training-based baselines in terms of FID, l2 distance among real and synthetic dataset embeddings, and classification accuracy, establishing ManifoldGD as the first geometry-aware training-free data distillation framework.

Abstract: Medical diagnosis requires the effective synthesis of visual manifestations and clinical metadata. However, existing methods often treat metadata as isolated tags, failing to exploit the rich semantic knowledge embedded in clinical descriptions. We propose PRIMA (Pre-training with Risk-integrated Image-Metadata Alignment), a framework that integrates domain-specific knowledge into multi-modal representation learning. We first curate an expert corpus of risk-disease correlations via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to refine Clinical ModernBERT, embedding diagnostic priors into the text encoder. To bridge the modality gap, we introduce a dual-encoder pre-training strategy utilizing DINOv3 and our refined BERT, optimized by a suite of four complementary loss functions. These losses are designed to capture multi-granular semantic alignment and handle the ambiguity of clinical correlations through soft labels. Finally, we leverage Qwen-3 to fuse these aligned features for precise disease classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRIMA effectively harmonizes pixel-level features with abstract clinical expertise, significantly outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our framework achieves superior robustness without the need for massive data collection or exhaustive computational resources. Our code will be made public upon acceptance.

Abstract: Omni-modal reasoning is essential for intelligent systems to understand and draw inferences from diverse data sources. While existing omni-modal large language models (OLLM) excel at perceiving diverse modalities, they lack the complex reasoning abilities of recent large reasoning models (LRM). However, enhancing the reasoning ability of OLLMs through additional training presents significant challenges, including the need for high-quality data, task-specific adaptation, and substantial computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose ThinkOmni, a training-free and data-free framework that lifts textual reasoning to omni-modal scenarios. ThinkOmni introduces two key components: 1) LRM-as-a-Guide, which leverages off-the-shelf LRMs to guide the OLLM decoding process; 2) Stepwise Contrastive Scaling, which adaptively balances perception and reasoning signals without manual hyperparameter tuning. Experiments on six multi-modal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ThinkOmni consistently delivers performance improvements, with main results achieving 70.2 on MathVista and 75.5 on MMAU. Overall, ThinkOmni offers a flexible and generalizable solution for omni-modal reasoning and provides new insights into the generalization and application of reasoning capabilities.

Conclusion: 该方法通过少样本设置和检索增强的测试时适配器，有效解决了开放词汇分割中的两大核心挑战，为开放词汇分割性能提升提供了新思路。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary segmentation (OVS) extends the zero-shot recognition capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) to pixel-level prediction, enabling segmentation of arbitrary categories specified by text prompts. Despite recent progress, OVS lags behind fully supervised approaches due to two challenges: the coarse image-level supervision used to train VLMs and the semantic ambiguity of natural language. We address these limitations by introducing a few-shot setting that augments textual prompts with a support set of pixel-annotated images. Building on this, we propose a retrieval-augmented test-time adapter that learns a lightweight, per-image classifier by fusing textual and visual support features. Unlike prior methods relying on late, hand-crafted fusion, our approach performs learned, per-query fusion, achieving stronger synergy between modalities. The method supports continually expanding support sets, and applies to fine-grained tasks such as personalized segmentation. Experiments show that we significantly narrow the gap between zero-shot and supervised segmentation while preserving open-vocabulary ability.

Abstract: Bio-inspired event cameras have recently attracted significant research due to their asynchronous and low-latency capabilities. These features provide a high dynamic range and significantly reduce motion blur. However, because of the novelty in the nature of their output signals, there is a gap in the variability of available data and a lack of extensive analysis of the parameters characterizing their signals. This paper addresses these issues by providing readers with an in-depth understanding of how intrinsic parameters affect the performance of a model trained on event data, specifically for object detection. We also use our findings to expand the capabilities of the downstream model towards sensor-agnostic robustness.

Abstract: We identify occlusion reasoning as a fundamental yet overlooked aspect for 3D layout-conditioned generation. It is essential for synthesizing partially occluded objects with depth-consistent geometry and scale. While existing methods can generate realistic scenes that follow input layouts, they often fail to model precise inter-object occlusions. We propose SeeThrough3D, a model for 3D layout conditioned generation that explicitly models occlusions. We introduce an occlusion-aware 3D scene representation (OSCR), where objects are depicted as translucent 3D boxes placed within a virtual environment and rendered from desired camera viewpoint. The transparency encodes hidden object regions, enabling the model to reason about occlusions, while the rendered viewpoint provides explicit camera control during generation. We condition a pretrained flow based text-to-image image generation model by introducing a set of visual tokens derived from our rendered 3D representation. Furthermore, we apply masked self-attention to accurately bind each object bounding box to its corresponding textual description, enabling accurate generation of multiple objects without object attribute mixing. To train the model, we construct a synthetic dataset with diverse multi-object scenes with strong inter-object occlusions. SeeThrough3D generalizes effectively to unseen object categories and enables precise 3D layout control with realistic occlusions and consistent camera control.

Abstract: We present a scalable 3D reconstruction model that addresses a critical limitation in offline feed-forward methods: their computational and memory requirements grow quadratically w.r.t. the number of input images. Our approach is built on the key insight that this bottleneck stems from the varying-length Key-Value (KV) space representation of scene geometry, which we distill into a fixed-size Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) via test-time training. VGG-T$^3$ (Visual Geometry Grounded Test Time Training) scales linearly w.r.t. the number of input views, similar to online models, and reconstructs a $1k$ image collection in just $54$ seconds, achieving a $11.6\times$ speed-up over baselines that rely on softmax attention. Since our method retains global scene aggregation capability, our point map reconstruction error outperforming other linear-time methods by large margins. Finally, we demonstrate visual localization capabilities of our model by querying the scene representation with unseen images.

Abstract: We introduce MediX-R1, an open-ended Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for medical multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that enables clinically grounded, free-form answers beyond multiple-choice formats. MediX-R1 fine-tunes a baseline vision-language backbone with Group Based RL and a composite reward tailored for medical reasoning: an LLM-based accuracy reward that judges semantic correctness with a strict YES/NO decision, a medical embedding-based semantic reward to capture paraphrases and terminology variants, and lightweight format and modality rewards that enforce interpretable reasoning and modality recognition. This multi-signal design provides stable, informative feedback for open-ended outputs where traditional verifiable or MCQ-only rewards fall short. To measure progress, we propose a unified evaluation framework for both text-only and image+text tasks that uses a Reference-based LLM-as-judge in place of brittle string-overlap metrics, capturing semantic correctness, reasoning, and contextual alignment. Despite using only $\sim51$K instruction examples, MediX-R1 achieves excellent results across standard medical LLM (text-only) and VLM (image + text) benchmarks, outperforming strong open-source baselines and delivering particularly large gains on open-ended clinical tasks. Our results demonstrate that open-ended RL with comprehensive reward signals and LLM-based evaluation is a practical path toward reliable medical reasoning in multimodal models.

Abstract: The discrete time queueing system is highly applicable to modern telecommunication systems, where it provides adaptive packet handling, congestion controlled security/inspection, energy efficient operation, and supports bursty traffic common in 5G, Internet of Things (IoT), and edge computing environments. In this article, we analyze an infinite-buffer discrete-time batch-arrival queue with single and multiple vacation policy where customers are served in batches, in two phases, namely first essential service (FES) and second optional service (SOS). In such systems, the FES corresponds to basic data processing or packet routing, while SOS represents secondary tasks such as encryption, error checking, data compression, or deep packet inspection that may not be necessary for every packet. Here, we derive the bivariate probability generating functions for the joint distribution of the number of packets waiting for transmission and the number are being processed immediately after the completion of both the FES and SOS. Furthermore, the complete joint distribution at arbitrary time slots, including vacation completion states, is established. Numerical illustrations demonstrate the applicability of the proposed framework, including an example with discrete phase type service time distribution. Finally, the sensitivity analysis of the key parameters on marginal system's probabilities and different performance measures have been investigated through several graphical representations.

Abstract: A thermodynamic framework for asymptotic inference is developed in which sample size and parameter variance define a state space. Within this description, Shannon information plays the role of entropy, and an integrating factor organizes its variation into a first-law-type balance equation. The framework supports a cyclic inequality analogous to a reversed second law, derived for the estimation of the mean. A non-trivial third-law-type result emerges as a lower bound on entropy set by representation noise. Optimal inference paths, global bounds on information gain, and a natural Carnot-like information efficiency follow from this structure, with efficiency fundamentally limited by a noise floor. Finally, de Bruijn's identity and the I-MMSE relation in the Gaussian-limit case appear as coordinate projections of the same underlying thermodynamic structure. This framework suggests that ensemble physics and inferential physics constitute shadow processes evolving in opposite directions within a unified thermodynamic description.

Abstract: Semantic communication has emerged as a promising paradigm for next-generation networks, yet several fundamental challenges remain unresolved. Building on the probabilistic model of semantic communication and leveraging the concept of context, this paper examines a specific subclass of semantic communication problems, where semantic noise originates solely from the semantic channel, assuming an ideal physical channel. To model this system, we introduce a virtual state-dependent channel, where the state-representing context-plays a crucial role in shaping communication. We further analyze the representational capability of the semantic encoder and explore various semantic communication scenarios in the presence of semantic noise, deriving capacity results for some cases and achievable rates for others.

### [108] [Frequency-Ordered Tokenization for Better Text Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22958)
*Maximilian Kalcher*

Main category: cs.IT

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于频率排序的分词预处理技术，通过利用自然语言标记的幂律分布特性来优化无损文本压缩效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用压缩算法对自然语言文本压缩不够高效，未能充分利用自然语言标记的频率分布特性（齐普夫定律）。通过预处理重新组织词汇表中tokens的编号顺序，可以使高频token获得更小的整数标识符，从而提升压缩性能。

Method: 该方法使用字节对编码(BPE)对文本进行分词，然后按照token频率从高到低重新排序词汇表，使高频率token对应小的整数标识符，最后用变长整数编码处理这些整数标识符，再将结果输入到任意标准压缩器中。

Result: 在enwik8（100MB维基百科文本）上，相比原始压缩方法，该方法使zlib改进7.08个百分点，LZMA改进1.69个百分点，zstd改进0.76个百分点。在1GB规模的enwik9以及中文、阿拉伯文文本上也获得一致改进。预处理后总体压缩时间相比原始zstd-22加快3.1倍，相比原始LZMA加快2.4倍。该方法可在50行代码内实现。

Conclusion: 频率排序分词是一种简单有效的文本压缩预处理技术，能显著提升多种通用压缩算法在自然语言文本上的压缩效果和速度，且实现简单，适用于多种语言。

Abstract: We present frequency-ordered tokenization, a simple preprocessing technique that improves lossless text compression by exploiting the power-law frequency distribution of natural language tokens (Zipf's law). The method tokenizes text with Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), reorders the vocabulary so that frequent tokens receive small integer identifiers, and encodes the result with variable-length integers before passing it to any standard compressor. On enwik8 (100 MB Wikipedia), this yields improvements of 7.08 percentage points (pp) for zlib, 1.69 pp for LZMA, and 0.76 pp for zstd (all including vocabulary overhead), outperforming the classical Word Replacing Transform. Gains are consistent at 1 GB scale (enwik9) and across Chinese and Arabic text. We further show that preprocessing accelerates compression for computationally expensive algorithms: the total wall-clock time including preprocessing is 3.1x faster than raw zstd-22 and 2.4x faster than raw LZMA, because the preprocessed input is substantially smaller. The method can be implemented in under 50 lines of code.

Conclusion: 流体天线通过其空间灵活性显著提升ISAC系统的物理层安全性，为安全传输提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Fluid antenna (FA) has become a highly promising technology and has recently been used to enhance the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. However, the scenario where sensing targets act as eavesdroppers in ISAC and how to maximize the sum secrecy rate has not been addressed. This letter investigates secure transmission in FA-aided ISAC systems, where the spatial agility of FAs enables enhanced physical layer security. We jointly optimize antenna position vector (APV) and beamforming to maximize the multiuser sum secrecy rate, which complicates the solution process. To solve the resulting non-convex problem, we use a block successive upper-bound minimization (BSUM) algorithm, which incorporates the proximal distance algorithm (PDA) for closed-form beamformer updates and extrapolated projected gradient (EPG) for APV optimization. Simulation results show that the proposed FA-ISAC scheme achieves over 20$\%$ sum secrecy rate gain compared to fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate potential in the field of scientific idea generation. However, the generated results often lack controllable academic context and traceable inspiration pathways. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a scientific idea generation system called GYWI, which combines author knowledge graphs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to form an external knowledge base to provide controllable context and trace of inspiration path for LLMs to generate new scientific ideas. We first propose an author-centered knowledge graph construction method and inspiration source sampling algorithms to construct external knowledge base. Then, we propose a hybrid retrieval mechanism that is composed of both RAG and GraphRAG to retrieve content with both depth and breadth knowledge. It forms a hybrid context. Thirdly, we propose a Prompt optimization strategy incorporating reinforcement learning principles to automatically guide LLMs optimizing the results based on the hybrid context. To evaluate the proposed approaches, we constructed an evaluation dataset based on arXiv (2018-2023). This paper also develops a comprehensive evaluation method including empirical automatic assessment in multiple-choice question task, LLM-based scoring, human evaluation, and semantic space visualization analysis. The generated ideas are evaluated from the following five dimensions: novelty, feasibility, clarity, relevance, and significance. We conducted experiments on different LLMs including GPT-4o, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen3-8B, and Gemini 2.5. Experimental results show that GYWI significantly outperforms mainstream LLMs in multiple metrics such as novelty, reliability, and relevance.

Abstract: We introduce FIRE, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate both the theoretical financial knowledge of LLMs and their ability to handle practical business scenarios. For theoretical assessment, we curate a diverse set of examination questions drawn from widely recognized financial qualification exams, enabling evaluation of LLMs deep understanding and application of financial knowledge. In addition, to assess the practical value of LLMs in real-world financial tasks, we propose a systematic evaluation matrix that categorizes complex financial domains and ensures coverage of essential subdomains and business activities. Based on this evaluation matrix, we collect 3,000 financial scenario questions, consisting of closed-form decision questions with reference answers and open-ended questions evaluated by predefined rubrics. We conduct comprehensive evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on the FIRE benchmark, including XuanYuan 4.0, our latest financial-domain model, as a strong in-domain baseline. These results enable a systematic analysis of the capability boundaries of current LLMs in financial applications. We publicly release the benchmark questions and evaluation code to facilitate future research.

Abstract: Abstractions of causal models allow for the coarsening of models such that relations of cause and effect are preserved. Whereas abstractions focus on the relation between two models, in this paper we study a framework for causal embeddings which enable multiple detailed models to be mapped into sub-systems of a coarser causal model. We define causal embeddings as a generalization of abstraction, and present a generalized notion of consistency. By defining a multi-resolution marginal problem, we showcase the relevance of causal embeddings for both the statistical marginal problem and the causal marginal problem; furthermore, we illustrate its practical use in merging datasets coming from models with different representations.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Traditional software relies on contracts -- APIs, type systems, assertions -- to specify and enforce correct behavior. AI agents, by contrast, operate on prompts and natural language instructions with no formal behavioral specification. This gap is the root cause of drift, governance failures, and frequent project failures in agentic AI deployments. We introduce Agent Behavioral Contracts (ABC), a formal framework that brings Design-by-Contract principles to autonomous AI agents. An ABC contract C = (P, I, G, R) specifies Preconditions, Invariants, Governance policies, and Recovery mechanisms as first-class, runtime-enforceable components. We define (p, delta, k)-satisfaction -- a probabilistic notion of contract compliance that accounts for LLM non-determinism and recovery -- and prove a Drift Bounds Theorem showing that contracts with recovery rate gamma > alpha (the natural drift rate) bound behavioral drift to D* = alpha/gamma in expectation, with Gaussian concentration in the stochastic setting. We establish sufficient conditions for safe contract composition in multi-agent chains and derive probabilistic degradation bounds. We implement ABC in AgentAssert, a runtime enforcement library, and evaluate on AgentContract-Bench, a benchmark of 200 scenarios across 7 models from 6 vendors. Results across 1,980 sessions show that contracted agents detect 5.2-6.8 soft violations per session that uncontracted baselines miss entirely (p < 0.0001, Cohen's d = 6.7-33.8), achieve 88-100% hard constraint compliance, and bound behavioral drift to D* < 0.27 across extended sessions, with 100% recovery for frontier models and 17-100% across all models, at overhead < 10 ms per action.

Abstract: AI agents -- systems that execute multi-step reasoning workflows with persistent state, tool access, and specialist skills -- represent a qualitative shift from prior automation technologies in social science. Unlike chatbots that respond to isolated queries, AI agents can now read files, run code, query databases, search the web, and invoke domain-specific skills to execute entire research pipelines autonomously. This paper introduces the concept of vibe researching -- the AI-era parallel to ``vibe coding'' (Karpathy, 2025) -- and uses scholar-skill, a 21-skill plugin for Claude Code covering the full research pipeline from idea to submission, as an illustrative case. I develop a cognitive task framework that classifies research activities along two dimensions -- codifiability and tacit knowledge requirement -- to identify a delegation boundary that is cognitive, not sequential: it cuts through every stage of the research pipeline, not between stages. I argue that AI agents excel at speed, coverage, and methodological scaffolding but struggle with theoretical originality and tacit field knowledge. The paper concludes with an analysis of three implications for the profession -- augmentation with fragile conditions, stratification risk, and a pedagogical crisis -- and proposes five principles for responsible vibe researching.

Abstract: Humans exhibit remarkable flexibility in abstract reasoning, and can rapidly learn and apply rules from sparse examples. To investigate the cognitive strategies underlying this ability, we introduce the Cognitive Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (CogARC), a diverse human-adapted subset of the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) which was originally developed to benchmark abstract reasoning in artificial intelligence. Across two experiments, CogARC was administered to a total of 260 human participants who freely generated solutions to 75 abstract visual reasoning problems. Success required inferring input-output rules from a small number of examples to transform the test input into one correct test output. Participants' behavior was recorded at high temporal resolution, including example viewing, edit sequences, and multi-attempt submissions. Participants were generally successful (mean accuracy ~90% for experiment 1 (n=40), ~80% for experiment 2 (n=220) across problems), but performance varied widely across problems and participants. Harder problems elicited longer deliberation times and greater divergence in solution strategies. Over the course of the task, participants initiated responses more quickly but showed a slight decline in accuracy, suggesting increased familiarity with the task structure rather than improved rule-learning ability. Importantly, even incorrect solutions were often highly convergent, even when the problem-solving trajectories differed in length and smoothness. Some trajectories progressed directly and efficiently toward a stable outcome, whereas others involved extended exploration or partial restarts before converging. Together, these findings highlight CogARC as a rich behavioral environment for studying human abstract reasoning, providing insight into how people generalize, misgeneralize, and adapt their strategies under uncertainty.

Motivation: 经典的投票理论假设参与者固定参与，而现实中的集体决策往往允许"我不知道"选项。本文旨在探索智能体通过学习自身可靠性并选择性弃权来提升集体准确性的机制。

Method: 提出概率框架，智能体经历校准阶段更新对自身固定能力的信念，然后面对最终置信门控决定是否投票或弃权；通过理论推导获得群体成功概率的非渐近下界，并通过蒙特卡洛模拟进行实证验证。

Result: 证明了选择性参与机制能够将孔多塞陪审团定理的渐近保证推广到序列的、置信门控的设置中，为群体决策提供了理论保障。

Conclusion: 该框架在集体决策中允许选择性参与能够提升准确性，特别在AI安全领域有应用前景，可减少集体LLM决策中的幻觉问题。

Abstract: We investigate the collective accuracy of heterogeneous agents who learn to estimate their own reliability over time and selectively abstain from voting. While classical epistemic voting results, such as the \textit{Condorcet Jury Theorem} (CJT), assume fixed participation, real-world aggregation often benefits from allowing agents to say ``I don't know.'' We propose a probabilistic framework where agents engage in a \textit{calibration} phase, updating beliefs about their own fixed competence, before facing a final confidence gate that determines whether to vote or abstain. We derive a non-asymptotic lower bound on the group's success probability and prove that this \textit{selective participation} generalizes the asymptotic guarantees of the CJT to a sequential, confidence-gated setting. Empirically, we validate these bounds via Monte Carlo simulations. While our results are general, we discuss their potential application to AI safety, outlining how this framework can mitigate \textit{hallucinations} in collective LLM decision-making.

Motivation: 传统硬件设计方法难以满足对计算能力爆炸性增长的需求，需要能级倍增器。最近的智能体生成AI系统在算法设计、代码效率提升和科学发现方面取得了显著进展。

Method: 使用ArchAgent系统，该系统基于AlphaEvolve，能够自动设计缓存替换策略（不仅调整参数，还能构建新的机制/逻辑）。智能体流程还支持“硅片后超专业化”，通过调整硬件策略中暴露的运行时可配置参数来进一步对齐特定工作负载。

Result: 1. 在两天内无需人工干预生成的政策，在公共多核Google Workload Traces上实现了5.3%的IPC速度提升
2. 在18天内为单核SPEC06工作负载生成的政策显示0.9%的IPC速度提升
3. 这些成果比之前人工开发的最先进政策快3-5倍
4. 通过“硅片后超专业化”，在SPEC06工作负载上实现了2.4%的IPC速度提升
5. 系统发现了“模拟器逃避”现象，揭示了AI系统能够利用人类设计工具中的漏洞

Conclusion: 智能体AI系统为计算机体系结构研究开辟了新可能，展示了自动化硬件设计的巨大潜力。同时也揭示了现有研究工具（原本为人类良好行为设计）在AI时代需要重新审视，以适应新的研究范式。

Abstract: Agile hardware design flows are a critically needed force multiplier to meet the exploding demand for compute. Recently, agentic generative AI systems have demonstrated significant advances in algorithm design, improving code efficiency, and enabling discovery across scientific domains.
  Bridging these worlds, we present ArchAgent, an automated computer architecture discovery system built on AlphaEvolve. We show ArchAgent's ability to automatically design/implement state-of-the-art (SoTA) cache replacement policies (architecting new mechanisms/logic, not only changing parameters), broadly within the confines of an established cache replacement policy design competition.
  In two days without human intervention, ArchAgent generated a policy achieving a 5.3% IPC speedup improvement over the prior SoTA on public multi-core Google Workload Traces. On the heavily-explored single-core SPEC06 workloads, it generated a policy in just 18 days showing a 0.9% IPC speedup improvement over the existing SoTA (a similar "winning margin" as reported by the existing SoTA). ArchAgent achieved these gains 3-5x faster than prior human-developed SoTA policies.
  Agentic flows also enable "post-silicon hyperspecialization" where agents tune runtime-configurable parameters exposed in hardware policies to further align the policies with a specific workload (mix). Exploiting this, we demonstrate a 2.4% IPC speedup improvement over prior SoTA on SPEC06 workloads.
  Finally, we outline broader implications for computer architecture research in the era of agentic AI. For example, we demonstrate the phenomenon of "simulator escapes", where the agentic AI flow discovered and exploited a loophole in a popular microarchitectural simulator - a consequence of the fact that these research tools were designed for a (now past) world where they were exclusively operated by humans acting in good-faith.

TL;DR: 本文对潜在推理机制进行了全面分析，发现了两个关键问题：普遍存在的捷径行为和实际搜索过程的偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 潜在推理作为一种新兴推理范式，通过在连续潜在空间而非离散文本空间中执行多步计算来增强推理能力。虽然已有大量研究致力于改进其性能，但其内部机制尚未得到充分研究，需要深入分析以理解潜在表示在推理过程中的角色和行为。

Method: 本研究对不同类型的潜在推理方法进行了系统性分析，重点研究了监督强度不同的各类方法。通过实验发现了两种关键现象：普遍存在的捷径行为（不依赖潜在推理即可达到高准确率），以及对潜在推理支持广度优先搜索式探索这一假设的验证。

Result: 研究发现：1）潜在推理方法普遍存在捷径行为；2）潜在表示虽然能编码多种可能性，但推理过程并未忠实实现结构化搜索，而是呈现出隐式剪枝和压缩；3）监督强度存在权衡：强监督减轻了捷径行为但限制了潜在表示维持多样化假设的能力，弱监督虽能获得更丰富的潜在表示但增加了捷径行为。

Conclusion: 本研究深入揭示了潜在推理的内部工作机制，发现现有方法并未充分利用潜在表示进行结构化搜索，而监督强度对模型行为有重要影响。这些发现为未来设计更有效的潜在推理方法提供了重要洞见，需要平衡监督强度与表示多样性的关系。

Abstract: Latent reasoning has been recently proposed as a reasoning paradigm and performs multi-step reasoning through generating steps in the latent space instead of the textual space. This paradigm enables reasoning beyond discrete language tokens by performing multi-step computation in continuous latent spaces. Although there have been numerous studies focusing on improving the performance of latent reasoning, its internal mechanisms remain not fully investigated. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of latent reasoning methods to better understand the role and behavior of latent representation in the process. We identify two key issues across latent reasoning methods with different levels of supervision. First, we observe pervasive shortcut behavior, where they achieve high accuracy without relying on latent reasoning. Second, we examine the hypothesis that latent reasoning supports BFS-like exploration in latent space, and find that while latent representations can encode multiple possibilities, the reasoning process does not faithfully implement structured search, but instead exhibits implicit pruning and compression. Finally, our findings reveal a trade-off associated with supervision strength: stronger supervision mitigates shortcut behavior but restricts the ability of latent representations to maintain diverse hypotheses, whereas weaker supervision allows richer latent representations at the cost of increased shortcut behavior.

Abstract: To operate reliably under changing conditions, complex systems require feedback on how effectively they use resources, not just whether objectives are met. Current AI systems process vast information to produce sophisticated predictions, yet predictions can appear successful while the underlying interaction with the environment degrades. What is missing is a principled measure of how much of the total information a system deploys is actually shared between its observations, actions, and outcomes. We prove this shared fraction, which we term bipredictability, P, is intrinsic to any interaction, derivable from first principles, and strictly bounded: P can reach unity in quantum systems, P equal to, or smaller than 0.5 in classical systems, and lower once agency (action selection) is introduced. We confirm these bounds in a physical system (double pendulum), reinforcement learning agents, and multi turn LLM conversations. These results distinguish agency from intelligence: agency is the capacity to act on predictions, whereas intelligence additionally requires learning from interaction, self-monitoring of its learning effectiveness, and adapting the scope of observations, actions, and outcomes to restore effective learning. By this definition, current AI systems achieve agency but not intelligence. Inspired by thalamocortical regulation in biological systems, we demonstrate a feedback architecture that monitors P in real time, establishing a prerequisite for adaptive, resilient AI.

Abstract: In Formula 1, race strategies are adapted according to evolving race conditions and competitors' actions. This paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach for multi-agent race strategy optimization. Agents learn to balance energy management, tire degradation, aerodynamic interaction, and pit-stop decisions. Building on a pre-trained single-agent policy, we introduce an interaction module that accounts for the behavior of competitors. The combination of the interaction module and a self-play training scheme generates competitive policies, and agents are ranked based on their relative performance. Results show that the agents adapt pit timing, tire selection, and energy allocation in response to opponents, achieving robust and consistent race performance. Because the framework relies only on information available during real races, it can support race strategists' decisions before and during races.

Motivation: 现有动作可行性评分器采用监督微调，无法有效区分物理上正确与细微错误的动作。需要一种能显式学习动作物理可行性判别能力的训练方法。

Method: 提出对比世界模型(CWM)，使用InfoNCE对比目标对大型语言模型进行微调，通过精心挖掘的硬负例（语义相似但物理不相容的动作）在评分空间中分离有效和无效动作。

Result: 内在可行性评估：在605个硬负例测试对中，CWM比SFT在最小编辑负例上的Precision@1提高6.76个百分点，AUC-ROC更高（0.929 vs 0.906）。实时过滤特性研究显示：在分布外压力条件下，CWM的安全边际显著更好（-2.39 vs -3.96）。

Conclusion: 对比训练引导的表示比单独使用监督微调更能准确捕捉物理可行性，验证了使用对比学习提升动作评分器性能的有效性。

Abstract: A reliable action feasibility scorer is a critical bottleneck in embodied agent pipelines: before any planning or reasoning occurs, the agent must identify which candidate actions are physically executable in the current state. Existing approaches use supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to train action scorers, but SFT treats each candidate independently and does not explicitly teach the model to discriminate between actions that are physically correct and those that are subtly wrong. We propose the Contrastive World Model (CWM), which fine-tunes a large language model (LLM) as an action scorer using an InfoNCE contrastive objective with hard-mined negative examples. The key idea is to push valid actions away from invalid ones in scoring space, with special emphasis on hard negatives: semantically similar but physically incompatible candidates. We evaluate CWM on the ScienceWorld benchmark through two studies. First, an intrinsic affordance evaluation on 605 hard-negative test pairs shows that CWM outperforms SFT by +6.76 percentage points on Precision@1 for minimal-edit negatives -- cases where a single word changes the physical outcome -- and achieves a higher AUC-ROC (0.929 vs. 0.906). Second, a live filter characterisation study measures how well CWM ranks gold-path actions against all valid environment actions during task execution. Under out-of-distribution stress conditions, CWM maintains a significantly better safety margin (-2.39) than SFT (-3.96), indicating that the gold action is ranked closer to the top. These results support the hypothesis that contrastive training induces representations that capture physical feasibility more faithfully than SFT alone.

Abstract: Large language models are beginning to show steganographic capabilities. Such capabilities could allow misaligned models to evade oversight mechanisms. Yet principled methods to detect and quantify such behaviours are lacking. Classical definitions of steganography, and detection methods based on them, require a known reference distribution of non-steganographic signals. For the case of steganographic reasoning in LLMs, knowing such a reference distribution is not feasible; this renders these approaches inapplicable. We propose an alternative, \textbf{decision-theoretic view of steganography}. Our central insight is that steganography creates an asymmetry in usable information between agents who can and cannot decode the hidden content (present within a steganographic signal), and this otherwise latent asymmetry can be inferred from the agents' observable actions. To formalise this perspective, we introduce generalised $\mathcal{V}$-information: a utilitarian framework for measuring the amount of usable information within some input. We use this to define the \textbf{steganographic gap} -- a measure that quantifies steganography by comparing the downstream utility of the steganographic signal to agents that can and cannot decode the hidden content. We empirically validate our formalism, and show that it can be used to detect, quantify, and mitigate steganographic reasoning in LLMs.

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly applied to operational decision-making where the underlying structure is constrained optimization. Existing benchmarks evaluate whether LLMs can formulate optimization problems as solver code, but leave open a complementary question. Can LLMs directly produce correct solutions to fully specified constrained optimization problems without access to a solver? We introduce ConstraintBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on direct constrained optimization across 10 operations research domains, with all ground-truth solutions verified by the Gurobi solver. Each task presents a natural-language scenario with entities, constraints, and an optimization objective; the model must return a structured solution that a deterministic verifier checks against every constraint and the solver-proven optimum. We evaluate six frontier models on 200 tasks and find that feasibility, not optimality, is the primary bottleneck. The best model achieves only 65.0% constraint satisfaction, yet feasible solutions average 89 to 96% of the Gurobi-optimal objective. No model exceeds 30.5% on joint feasibility and optimality within 0.1% of the solver reference. Per-domain analysis shows large variation in difficulty, with average feasibility spanning from 83.3% in the production mix domain to 0.8% in the crew assignment domain. Further, systematic failure modes include duration constraint misunderstanding, entity hallucination, and a feasibility-optimality decoupling in facility location and vehicle routing where models achieve high feasibility but 0% optimality. ConstraintBench and all evaluation infrastructure will be publicly released.

Abstract: Integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into life cycle assessment (LCA) has accelerated in recent years, with numerous studies successfully adapting machine learning algorithms to support various stages of LCA. Despite this rapid development, comprehensive and broad synthesis of AI-LCA research remains limited. To address this gap, this study presents a detailed review of published work at the intersection of AI and LCA, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to identify current trends, emerging themes, and future directions. Our analyses reveal that as LCA research continues to expand, the adoption of AI technologies has grown dramatically, with a noticeable shift toward LLM-driven approaches, continued increases in ML applications, and statistically significant correlations between AI approaches and corresponding LCA stages. By integrating LLM-based text-mining methods with traditional literature review techniques, this study introduces a dynamic and effective framework capable of capturing both high-level research trends and nuanced conceptual patterns (themes) across the field. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-assisted methodologies to support large-scale, reproducible reviews across broad research domains, while also evaluating pathways for computationally-efficient LCA in the context of rapidly developing AI technologies. In doing so, this work helps LCA practitioners incorporate state-of-the-art tools and timely insights into environmental assessments that can enhance the rigor and quality of sustainability-driven decisions and decision-making processes.

Abstract: While contemporary large language models (LLMs) are increasingly capable in isolation, there are still many difficult problems that lie beyond the abilities of a single LLM. For such tasks, there is still uncertainty about how best to take many LLMs as parts and combine them into a greater whole. This position paper argues that potential blueprints for designing such modular language agents can be found in the existing literature on cognitive models and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. To make this point clear, we formalize the idea of an agent template that specifies roles for individual LLMs and how their functionalities should be composed. We then survey a variety of existing language agents in the literature and highlight their underlying templates derived directly from cognitive models or AI algorithms. By highlighting these designs, we aim to call attention to agent templates inspired by cognitive science and AI as a powerful tool for developing effective, interpretable language agents.

Abstract: Agentic artificial intelligence (AI) is emerging as a key enabler for autonomous radio access networks (RANs), where multiple large language model (LLM)-based agents reason and collaborate to achieve operator-defined intents. The open RAN (O-RAN) architecture enables the deployment and coordination of such agents. However, most existing works consider simple intents handled by independent agents, while complex intents that require coordination among agents remain unexplored. In this paper, we propose an agentic AI framework for intent translation and optimization in cell-free O-RAN. A supervisor agent translates the operator intents into an optimization objective and minimum rate requirements. Based on this information, a user weighting agent retrieves relevant prior experience from a memory module to determine the user priority weights for precoding. If the intent includes an energy-saving objective, then an open radio unit (O-RU) management agent will also be activated to determine the set of active O-RUs by using a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. A monitoring agent measures and monitors the user data rates and coordinates with other agents to guarantee the minimum rate requirements are satisfied. To enhance scalability, we adopt a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that enables the same underlying LLM to be used for different agents. Simulation results show that the proposed agentic AI framework reduces the number of active O-RUs by 41.93% when compared with three baseline schemes in energy-saving mode. Using the PEFT method, the proposed framework reduces the memory usage by 92% when compared with deploying separate LLM agents.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) based agents excel at general reasoning but often fail in specialized domains where success hinges on long-tail knowledge absent from their training data. While human experts can provide this missing knowledge, their guidance is often unstructured and unreliable, making its direct integration into an agent's plan problematic. To address this, we introduce AHCE (Active Human-Augmented Challenge Engagement), a framework for on-demand Human-AI collaboration. At its core, the Human Feedback Module (HFM) employs a learned policy to treat the human expert as an interactive reasoning tool. Extensive experiments in Minecraft demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, increasing task success rates by 32% on normal difficulty tasks and nearly 70% on highly difficult tasks, all with minimal human intervention. Our work demonstrates that successfully augmenting agents requires learning how to request expert reasoning, moving beyond simple requests for help.

Motivation: 基于样例的引导在数学推理中效果不稳定，即使引导本身正确且相关，这促使研究者深入研究策略使用与策略可执行性之间的差异，以解决引导效果波动的问题。

Method: 通过对比人工编写和模型生成的解决方案，分析策略使用与可执行性的差异，提出选择性策略检索（SSR）框架，利用经验性、多路径、来源感知的信号选择性检索和组合策略。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，SSR相比直接求解、上下文学习和单源引导，能可靠且一致地提升性能，如在AIME25上准确率提升+13点，在Apex上提升+5点。

Conclusion: 策略可执行性是影响引导效果的关键因素，SSR框架能有效建模可执行性，显著提升数学推理模型的性能，并为相关研究提供了新的基准和代码资源。

Abstract: Example-based guidance is widely used to improve mathematical reasoning at inference time, yet its effectiveness is highly unstable across problems and models-even when the guidance is correct and problem-relevant. We show that this instability arises from a previously underexplored gap between strategy usage-whether a reasoning strategy appears in successful solutions-and strategy executability-whether the strategy remains effective when instantiated as guidance for a target model. Through a controlled analysis of paired human-written and model-generated solutions, we identify a systematic dissociation between usage and executability: human- and model-derived strategies differ in structured, domain-dependent ways, leading to complementary strengths and consistent source-dependent reversals under guidance. Building on this diagnosis, we propose Selective Strategy Retrieval (SSR), a test-time framework that explicitly models executability by selectively retrieving and combining strategies using empirical, multi-route, source-aware signals. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, SSR yields reliable and consistent improvements over direct solving, in-context learning, and single-source guidance, improving accuracy by up to $+13$ points on AIME25 and $+5$ points on Apex for compact reasoning models.

Motivation: 人类评估在AI模型训练和评估中至关重要，但这些数据很少被作为包含系统性误差的测量来处理。当前缺乏对评分者偏差（如严重性和集中性）的校正方法。

Method: 采用项目反应理论（IRT）的评分者模型，特别是多面Rasch模型，分析OpenAI摘要数据集，分离真实输出质量和评分者行为特征。

Result: 实验显示，校正评分者严重性可以获得更准确的摘要质量估计，并提供评分者表现的诊断性见解。调整后的评分比原始评分更可靠。

Conclusion: 将心理测量模型整合到人工评估环节，能够更原则性、透明地使用人类数据，使开发者基于调整后的分数而非原始误差评分做出决策，为AI开发和评估提供更稳健、可解释的方法。

Abstract: Human evaluations play a central role in training and assessing AI models, yet these data are rarely treated as measurements subject to systematic error. This paper integrates psychometric rater models into the AI pipeline to improve the reliability and validity of conclusions drawn from human judgments. The paper reviews common rater effects, severity and centrality, that distort observed ratings, and demonstrates how item response theory rater models, particularly the multi-faceted Rasch model, can separate true output quality from rater behavior. Using the OpenAI summarization dataset as an empirical example, we show how adjusting for rater severity produces corrected estimates of summary quality and provides diagnostic insight into rater performance. Incorporating psychometric modeling into human-in-the-loop evaluation offers more principled and transparent use of human data, enabling developers to make decisions based on adjusted scores rather than raw, error-prone ratings. This perspective highlights a path toward more robust, interpretable, and construct-aligned practices for AI development and evaluation.

Abstract: Long-running agentic tasks, such as deep research, require multi-hop reasoning over information distributed across multiple webpages and documents. In such tasks, the LLM context is dominated by tokens from external retrieval, causing memory usage to grow rapidly and limiting decode performance. While several KV cache compression techniques exist for long-context inputs, we find that existing heuristics fail to support multi-step reasoning models effectively. We address this challenge with SideQuest -- a novel approach that leverages the Large Reasoning Model (LRM) itself to perform KV cache compression by reasoning about the usefulness of tokens in its context. To prevent the tokens associated with this management process from polluting the model's memory, we frame KV cache compression as an auxiliary task executed in parallel to the main reasoning task. Our evaluations, using a model trained with just 215 samples, show that SideQuest reduces peak token usage by up to 65% on agentic tasks with minimal degradation in accuracy, outperforming heuristic-based KV cache compression techniques.

Abstract: Route-planning agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for supporting everyday human mobility through natural language interaction and tool-mediated decision making. However, systematic evaluation in real-world mobility settings is hindered by diverse routing demands, non-deterministic mapping services, and limited reproducibility. In this study, we introduce MobilityBench, a scalable benchmark for evaluating LLM-based route-planning agents in real-world mobility scenarios. MobilityBench is constructed from large-scale, anonymized real user queries collected from Amap and covers a broad spectrum of route-planning intents across multiple cities worldwide. To enable reproducible, end-to-end evaluation, we design a deterministic API-replay sandbox that eliminates environmental variance from live services. We further propose a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol centered on outcome validity, complemented by assessments of instruction understanding, planning, tool use, and efficiency. Using MobilityBench, we evaluate multiple LLM-based route-planning agents across diverse real-world mobility scenarios and provide an in-depth analysis of their behaviors and performance. Our findings reveal that current models perform competently on Basic information retrieval and Route Planning tasks, yet struggle considerably with Preference-Constrained Route Planning, underscoring significant room for improvement in personalized mobility applications. We publicly release the benchmark data, evaluation toolkit, and documentation at https://github.com/AMAP-ML/MobilityBench .

Motivation: 在线广告环境复杂多变，尤其在多渠道场景下，预算和约束的有效分配对投资回报优化至关重要。现有基于优化的方法缺乏动态适应性，强化学习方法难以捕捉历史依赖和观测模式。

Method: 提出AHBid适应性分层竞价框架：高层基于扩散模型的生成规划器动态分配预算和约束；引入约束强制机制和轨迹优化机制；结合历史知识与实时信息的控制型竞价算法。

Result: 在大规模离线数据集和在线A/B测试中验证有效性，相比现有基线总体回报提升13.57%。

Conclusion: AHBid通过生成规划与实时控制的结合，有效解决了多渠道广告投放的动态优化问题，显著提升了竞价性能和投资回报。

Abstract: In online advertising, the inherent complexity and dynamic nature of advertising environments necessitate the use of auto-bidding services to assist advertisers in bid optimization. This complexity is further compounded in multi-channel scenarios, where effective allocation of budgets and constraints across channels with distinct behavioral patterns becomes critical for optimizing return on investment. Current approaches predominantly rely on either optimization-based strategies or reinforcement learning techniques. However, optimization-based methods lack flexibility in adapting to dynamic market conditions, while reinforcement learning approaches often struggle to capture essential historical dependencies and observational patterns within the constraints of Markov Decision Process frameworks. To address these limitations, we propose AHBid, an Adaptable Hierarchical Bidding framework that integrates generative planning with real-time control. The framework employs a high-level generative planner based on diffusion models to dynamically allocate budgets and constraints by effectively capturing historical context and temporal patterns. We introduce a constraint enforcement mechanism to ensure compliance with specified constraints, along with a trajectory refinement mechanism that enhances adaptability to environmental changes through the utilization of historical data. The system further incorporates a control-based bidding algorithm that synergistically combines historical knowledge with real-time information, significantly improving both adaptability and operational efficacy. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale offline datasets and through online A/B tests demonstrate the effectiveness of AHBid, yielding a 13.57% increase in overall return compared to existing baselines.

Abstract: Large language models have enabled agents that reason, plan, and interact with tools and environments to accomplish complex tasks. As these agents operate over extended interaction horizons, their effectiveness increasingly depends on adapting behavior to individual users and maintaining continuity across time, giving rise to personalized LLM-powered agents. In such long-term, user-dependent settings, personalization permeates the entire decision pipeline rather than remaining confined to surface-level generation. This survey provides a capability-oriented review of personalized LLM-powered agents. We organize the literature around four interdependent components: profile modeling, memory, planning, and action execution. Using this taxonomy, we synthesize representative methods and analyze how user signals are represented, propagated, and utilized, highlighting cross-component interactions and recurring design trade-offs. We further examine evaluation metrics and benchmarks tailored to personalized agents, summarize application scenarios spanning general assistance to specialized domains, and outline future directions for research and deployment. By offering a structured framework for understanding and designing personalized LLM-powered agents, this survey charts a roadmap toward more user-aligned, adaptive, robust, and deployable agentic systems, accelerating progress from prototype personalization to scalable real-world assistants.

Abstract: Existing neural network calibration methods often treat calibration as a static, post-hoc optimization task. However, this neglects the dynamic and temporal nature of real-world inference. Moreover, existing methods do not provide an intuitive interface enabling human operators to dynamically adjust model behavior under shifting conditions. In this work, we propose Knob, a framework that connects deep learning with classical control theory by mapping neural gating dynamics to a second-order mechanical system. By establishing correspondences between physical parameters -- damping ratio ($ζ$) and natural frequency ($ω_n$) -- and neural gating, we create a tunable "safety valve". The core mechanism employs a logit-level convex fusion, functioning as an input-adaptive temperature scaling. It tends to reduce model confidence particularly when model branches produce conflicting predictions. Furthermore, by imposing second-order dynamics (Knob-ODE), we enable a \textit{dual-mode} inference: standard i.i.d. processing for static tasks, and state-preserving processing for continuous streams. Our framework allows operators to tune "stability" and "sensitivity" through familiar physical analogues. This paper presents an exploratory architectural interface; we focus on demonstrating the concept and validating its control-theoretic properties rather than claiming state-of-the-art calibration performance. Experiments on CIFAR-10-C validate the calibration mechanism and demonstrate that, in Continuous Mode, the gate responses are consistent with standard second-order control signatures (step settling and low-pass attenuation), paving the way for predictable human-in-the-loop tuning.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has been widely applied to Large Language Model (LLM) post-training to align model outputs with human preferences. Recent models, such as DeepSeek-R1, have also shown RLHF's potential to improve LLM reasoning on complex tasks. In RL, inference and training co-exist, creating dynamic resource demands throughout the workflow. Compared to traditional RL, RLHF further challenges training efficiency due to expanding model sizes and resource consumption. Several RLHF frameworks aim to balance flexible abstraction and efficient execution. However, they rely on serverful infrastructures, which struggle with fine-grained resource variability. As a result, during synchronous RLHF training, idle time between or within RL components often causes overhead and resource wastage.
  To address these issues, we present RLHFless, the first scalable training framework for synchronous RLHF, built on serverless computing environments. RLHFless adapts to dynamic resource demands throughout the RLHF pipeline, pre-computes shared prefixes to avoid repeated computation, and uses a cost-aware actor scaling strategy that accounts for response length variation to find sweet spots with lower cost and higher speed. In addition, RLHFless assigns workloads efficiently to reduce intra-function imbalance and idle time. Experiments on both physical testbeds and a large-scale simulated cluster show that RLHFless achieves up to 1.35x speedup and 44.8% cost reduction compared to the state-of-the-art baseline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐模型的性能取决于训练数据的质量、数量和相关性，但数据稀疏性和冷启动问题常见。虽然可以利用多个辅助域的数据来丰富目标域信息，但固有的域间差距可能导致负迁移和性能下降。现有的模型中心方法依赖复杂定制化的架构，难以捕捉跨域的微妙、非结构化的序列依赖，导致泛化能力差且计算资源需求高。

Method: Taesar是一种数据中心框架，用于目标对齐的序列生成。它采用对比解码机制来自适应地将跨域上下文编码为目标域序列，使标准模型无需复杂融合架构即可学习跨域的复杂依赖关系。

Result: 实验表明，Taesar的性能优于模型中心解决方案，并且能够推广到各种序列模型。通过生成丰富的数据集，Taesar有效地结合了数据中心和模型中心两种范式的优势。

Conclusion: Taesar框架通过数据中心的方式解决了跨域推荐中的挑战，既避免了负迁移问题，又降低了计算复杂度，展示了其在实际应用中的有效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recommendation model performance is intrinsically tied to the quality, volume, and relevance of their training data. To address common challenges like data sparsity and cold start, recent researchs have leveraged data from multiple auxiliary domains to enrich information within the target domain. However, inherent domain gaps can degrade the quality of mixed-domain data, leading to negative transfer and diminished model performance. Existing prevailing \emph{model-centric} paradigm -- which relies on complex, customized architectures -- struggles to capture the subtle, non-structural sequence dependencies across domains, leading to poor generalization and high demands on computational resources. To address these shortcomings, we propose \textsc{Taesar}, a \emph{data-centric} framework for \textbf{t}arget-\textbf{a}lign\textbf{e}d \textbf{s}equenti\textbf{a}l \textbf{r}egeneration, which employs a contrastive decoding mechanism to adaptively encode cross-domain context into target-domain sequences. It employs contrastive decoding to encode cross-domain context into target sequences, enabling standard models to learn intricate dependencies without complex fusion architectures. Experiments show \textsc{Taesar} outperforms model-centric solutions and generalizes to various sequential models. By generating enriched datasets, \textsc{Taesar} effectively combines the strengths of data- and model-centric paradigms.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have emerged as a powerful paradigm for solving complex real-world tasks. In practice, these models are predominantly trained via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), yet most existing outcome-only RLVR pipelines rely almost exclusively on a binary correctness signal and largely ignore the model's intrinsic uncertainty. We term this discrepancy the uncertainty-reward mismatch, under which high- and low-uncertainty solutions are treated equivalently, preventing the policy from "Know What You Know" and impeding the shift from optimizing for correct answers to optimizing effective reasoning paths. This limitation is especially critical in reasoning-centric tasks such as mathematics and question answering, where performance hinges on the quality of the model's internal reasoning process rather than mere memorization of final answers. To address this, we propose EGPO, a metacognitive entropy calibration framework that explicitly integrates intrinsic uncertainty into RLVR for enhancing LRMs. EGPO estimates per-sample uncertainty using a zero-overhead entropy proxy derived from token-level likelihoods and aligns it with extrinsic correctness through an asymmetric calibration mechanism that preserves correct reasoning while selectively regulating overconfident failures, thereby enabling stable and uncertainty-aware policy optimization. Moreover, EGPO recovers informative learning signals from otherwise degenerate group-based rollouts without modifying the verifier or reward definition. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed EGPO leads to substantial and consistent improvements in reasoning performance, establishing a principled path for advancing LRMs through metacognitive entropy calibration.

Abstract: We decompose physician disagreement in the HealthBench medical AI evaluation dataset to understand where variance resides and what observable features can explain it. Rubric identity accounts for 15.8% of met/not-met label variance but only 3.6-6.9% of disagreement variance; physician identity accounts for just 2.4%. The dominant 81.8% case-level residual is not reduced by HealthBench's metadata labels (z = -0.22, p = 0.83), normative rubric language (pseudo R^2 = 1.2%), medical specialty (0/300 Tukey pairs significant), surface-feature triage (AUC = 0.58), or embeddings (AUC = 0.485). Disagreement follows an inverted-U with completion quality (AUC = 0.689), confirming physicians agree on clearly good or bad outputs but split on borderline cases. Physician-validated uncertainty categories reveal that reducible uncertainty (missing context, ambiguous phrasing) more than doubles disagreement odds (OR = 2.55, p < 10^(-24)), while irreducible uncertainty (genuine medical ambiguity) has no effect (OR = 1.01, p = 0.90), though even the former explains only ~3% of total variance. The agreement ceiling in medical AI evaluation is thus largely structural, but the reducible/irreducible dissociation suggests that closing information gaps in evaluation scenarios could lower disagreement where inherent clinical ambiguity does not, pointing toward actionable evaluation design improvements.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are deployed as autonomous agents in increasingly complex applications, where enabling long-horizon memory is critical for achieving strong performance. However, a significant gap exists between practical applications and current evaluation standards for agent memory: existing benchmarks primarily focus on dialogue-centric, human-agent interactions. In reality, agent memory consists of a continuous stream of agent-environment interactions that are primarily composed of machine-generated representations. To bridge this gap, we introduce AMA-Bench (Agent Memory with Any length), which evaluates long-horizon memory for LLMs in real agentic applications. It features two key components: (1) a set of real-world agentic trajectories across representative agentic applications, paired with expert-curated QA, and (2) a set of synthetic agentic trajectories that scale to arbitrary horizons, paired with rule-based QA. Our comprehensive study shows that existing memory systems underperform on AMA-Bench primarily because they lack causality and objective information and are constrained by the lossy nature of similarity-based retrieval employed by many memory systems. To address these limitations, we propose AMA-Agent, an effective memory system featuring a causality graph and tool-augmented retrieval. Our results demonstrate that AMA-Agent achieves 57.22% average accuracy on AMA-Bench, surpassing the strongest memory system baselines by 11.16%.

TL;DR: LLMs在临床不完全信息场景下难以判断是否足够得出结论，导致过早判断或过度弃权，虽然掌握了评分知识且在完全信息下表现良好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床决策常面临信息不完整情况，专家需评估现有信息是否足以做出判断，过早结论或不必要弃权都可能危及患者安全，需要评估LLMs在此场景下的能力。

Method: 基于临床评分系统开发ClinDet-Bench基准，将不完全信息场景分解为可确定和不可确定的条件，要求考虑所有关于缺失信息的假设（包括不可能情况）并验证结论是否在所有情况下成立。

Result: 近期LLMs无法识别不完全信息下的可确定性，既产生过早判断也过度弃权，尽管能正确解释基础评分知识且在完全信息下表现良好。

Conclusion: 现有基准不足以评估LLMs在临床环境中的安全性，ClinDet-Bench提供了评估可确定性识别能力的框架，可实现适当弃权，适用于医学和其他高风险领域，已公开可用。

Abstract: Clinical decisions are often required under incomplete information. Clinical experts must identify whether available information is sufficient for judgment, as both premature conclusion and unnecessary abstention can compromise patient safety. To evaluate this capability of large language models (LLMs), we developed ClinDet-Bench, a benchmark based on clinical scoring systems that decomposes incomplete-information scenarios into determinable and undeterminable conditions. Identifying determinability requires considering all hypotheses about missing information, including unlikely ones, and verifying whether the conclusion holds across them. We find that recent LLMs fail to identify determinability under incomplete information, producing both premature judgments and excessive abstention, despite correctly explaining the underlying scoring knowledge and performing well under complete information. These findings suggest that existing benchmarks are insufficient to evaluate the safety of LLMs in clinical settings. ClinDet-Bench provides a framework for evaluating determinability recognition, leading to appropriate abstention, with potential applicability to medicine and other high-stakes domains, and is publicly available.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress of large language models (LLMs), the capabilities of standalone LLMs have begun to plateau when tackling real-world, complex tasks that require interaction with external tools and dynamic environments. Although recent agent frameworks aim to enhance model autonomy through tool integration and external interaction, they still suffer from naive workflows, unstable performance, limited support across diverse benchmarks and tasks, and heavy reliance on costly commercial APIs. In this work, we propose a high-performance and robust open-source agent framework, termed MiroFlow, which incorporates an agent graph for flexible orchestration, an optional deep reasoning mode to enhance performance, and a robust workflow execution to ensure stable and reproducible performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MiroFlow consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple agent benchmarks, including GAIA, BrowseComp-EN/ZH, HLE, xBench-DeepSearch, and notably FutureX. We hope it could serve as an easily accessible, reproducible, and comparable baseline for the deep research community.

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为FlexMS的基准框架，用于构建和评估质谱预测中的多种深度学习模型架构，并提供性能影响因素分析以指导模型选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分子识别与性质预测在药物发现和材料科学中至关重要，串联质谱技术能提供有价值的分裂线索，但实验谱图的匮乏阻碍了分子鉴定，因此需要计算模型的预测方法。而深度学习模型在预测分子结构谱图方面有潜力，但由于方法异质性和缺乏明确基准，整体评估仍具挑战性。

Method: 开发了FlexMS基准框架，支持动态构建多种不同模型架构的组合，使用预处理公开数据集和不同指标评估性能，并分析影响性能的因素，包括数据集结构多样性、超参数（如学习率和数据稀疏性）、预训练效果、元数据消融设置和跨域迁移学习分析。同时，检索基准可模拟实际识别场景，基于预测谱图对潜在匹配进行评分。

Conclusion: FlexMS基准框架通过系统化评估不同深度学习模型在质谱预测中的性能，明确了关键影响因素，有助于推进分子识别和性质预测的研究与应用。

Abstract: The identification and property prediction of chemical molecules is of central importance in the advancement of drug discovery and material science, where the tandem mass spectrometry technology gives valuable fragmentation cues in the form of mass-to-charge ratio peaks. However, the lack of experimental spectra hinders the attachment of each molecular identification, and thus urges the establishment of prediction approaches for computational models. Deep learning models appear promising for predicting molecular structure spectra, but overall assessment remains challenging as a result of the heterogeneity in methods and the lack of well-defined benchmarks. To address this, our contribution is the creation of benchmark framework FlexMS for constructing and evaluating diverse model architectures in mass spectrum prediction. With its easy-to-use flexibility, FlexMS supports the dynamic construction of numerous distinct combinations of model architectures, while assessing their performance on preprocessed public datasets using different metrics. In this paper, we provide insights into factors influencing performance, including the structural diversity of datasets, hyperparameters like learning rate and data sparsity, pretraining effects, metadata ablation settings and cross-domain transfer learning analysis. This provides practical guidance in choosing suitable models. Moreover, retrieval benchmarks simulate practical identification scenarios and score potential matches based on predicted spectra.

Abstract: Presentation generation requires deep content research, coherent visual design, and iterative refinement based on observation. However, existing presentation agents often rely on predefined workflows and fixed templates. To address this, we present DeepPresenter, an agentic framework that adapts to diverse user intents, enables effective feedback-driven refinement, and generalizes beyond a scripted pipeline. Specifically, DeepPresenter autonomously plans, renders, and revises intermediate slide artifacts to support long-horizon refinement with environmental observations. Furthermore, rather than relying on self-reflection over internal signals (e.g., reasoning traces), our environment-grounded reflection conditions the generation process on perceptual artifact states (e.g., rendered slides), enabling the system to identify and correct presentation-specific issues during execution. Results on the evaluation set covering diverse presentation-generation scenarios show that DeepPresenter achieves state-of-the-art performance, and the fine-tuned 9B model remains highly competitive at substantially lower cost.

Abstract: Can artificial intelligence truly contribute to creative mathematical research, or does it merely automate routine calculations while introducing risks of error? We provide empirical evidence through a detailed case study: the discovery of novel error representations and bounds for Hermite quadrature rules via systematic human-AI collaboration.
  Working with multiple AI assistants, we extended results beyond what manual work achieved, formulating and proving several theorems with AI assistance. The collaboration revealed both remarkable capabilities and critical limitations. AI excelled at algebraic manipulation, systematic proof exploration, literature synthesis, and LaTeX preparation. However, every step required rigorous human verification, mathematical intuition for problem formulation, and strategic direction.
  We document the complete research workflow with unusual transparency, revealing patterns in successful human-AI mathematical collaboration and identifying failure modes researchers must anticipate. Our experience suggests that, when used with appropriate skepticism and verification protocols, AI tools can meaningfully accelerate mathematical discovery while demanding careful human oversight and deep domain expertise.

TL;DR: 论文针对当前多模态大语言模型仅限于双模态交互的局限，提出了统一的多模态基准OmniGAIA和原生多模态基础智能体OmniAtlas，旨在推进全能模态AI助手的发展。


<details>

Motivation: 当前多模态大型语言模型主要局限于视觉-语言等双模态交互，缺乏统一的多模态认知能力，无法满足通用AI助手的需求。为了弥合这一差距，需要开发能够跨视频、音频、图像等多种模态进行深度推理和多轮工具执行的评估基准和智能体。

Abstract: Human intelligence naturally intertwines omni-modal perception -- spanning vision, audio, and language -- with complex reasoning and tool usage to interact with the world. However, current multi-modal LLMs are primarily confined to bi-modal interactions (e.g., vision-language), lacking the unified cognitive capabilities required for general AI assistants. To bridge this gap, we introduce OmniGAIA, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate omni-modal agents on tasks necessitating deep reasoning and multi-turn tool execution across video, audio, and image modalities. Constructed via a novel omni-modal event graph approach, OmniGAIA synthesizes complex, multi-hop queries derived from real-world data that require cross-modal reasoning and external tool integration. Furthermore, we propose OmniAtlas, a native omni-modal foundation agent under tool-integrated reasoning paradigm with active omni-modal perception. Trained on trajectories synthesized via a hindsight-guided tree exploration strategy and OmniDPO for fine-grained error correction, OmniAtlas effectively enhances the tool-use capabilities of existing open-source models. This work marks a step towards next-generation native omni-modal AI assistants for real-world scenarios.

Abstract: The promise of general-purpose agents - systems that perform tasks in unfamiliar environments without domain-specific engineering - remains largely unrealized. Existing agents are predominantly specialized, and while emerging implementations like OpenAI SDK Agent and Claude Code hint at broader capabilities, no systematic evaluation of their general performance has been pursued. Current agentic benchmarks assume domain-specific integration, encoding task information in ways that preclude fair evaluation of general agents. This paper frames general-agent evaluation as a first-class research objective. We propose conceptual principles for such evaluation, a Unified Protocol enabling agent-benchmark integration, and Exgentic - a practical framework for general agent evaluation. We benchmark five prominent agent implementations across six environments as the first Open General Agent Leaderboard. Our experiments show that general agents generalize across diverse environments, achieving performance comparable to domain-specific agents without any environment-specific tuning. We release our evaluation protocol, framework, and leaderboard to establish a foundation for systematic research on general-purpose agents.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have substantially advanced video misinformation detection through unified multimodal reasoning, but they often rely on fixed-depth inference and place excessive trust in internally generated assumptions, particularly in scenarios where critical evidence is sparse, fragmented, or requires external verification. To address these limitations, we propose FactGuard, an agentic framework for video misinformation detection that formulates verification as an iterative reasoning process built upon MLLMs. FactGuard explicitly assesses task ambiguity and selectively invokes external tools to acquire critical evidence, enabling progressive refinement of reasoning trajectories. To further strengthen this capability, we introduce a two-stage training strategy that combines domain-specific agentic supervised fine-tuning with decision-aware reinforcement learning to optimize tool usage and calibrate risk-sensitive decision making. Extensive experiments on FakeSV, FakeTT, and FakeVV demonstrate FactGuard's state-of-the-art performance and validate its excellent robustness and generalization capacity.

Abstract: As LLMs achieved breakthroughs in general reasoning, their proficiency in specialized scientific domains reveals pronounced gaps in existing benchmarks due to data contamination, insufficient complexity, and prohibitive human labor costs. Here we present SPM-Bench, an original, PhD-level multimodal benchmark specifically designed for scanning probe microscopy (SPM). We propose a fully automated data synthesis pipeline that ensures both high authority and low-cost. By employing Anchor-Gated Sieve (AGS) technology, we efficiently extract high-value image-text pairs from arXiv and journal papers published between 2023 and 2025. Through a hybrid cloud-local architecture where VLMs return only spatial coordinates "llbox" for local high-fidelity cropping, our pipeline achieves extreme token savings while maintaining high dataset purity. To accurately and objectively evaluate the performance of the LLMs, we introduce the Strict Imperfection Penalty F1 (SIP-F1) score. This metric not only establishes a rigorous capability hierarchy but also, for the first time, quantifies model "personalities" (Conservative, Aggressive, Gambler, or Wise). By correlating these results with model-reported confidence and perceived difficulty, we expose the true reasoning boundaries of current AI in complex physical scenarios. These insights establish SPM-Bench as a generalizable paradigm for automated scientific data synthesis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键的临床AI系统中，人机协同验证至关重要，但AI模型推理与专家修正之间的过渡很少被分析为结构化信号。需要更精确地量化AI系统与临床专家诊断之间的对齐程度。

Method: 采用诊断对齐框架，通过视觉大语言模型、BERT医学实体提取和序列语言模型推理生成AI报告，与医生验证结果系统比较。评估基于四种一致性指标：精确主要匹配率、语义相似调整率、跨类别对齐和综合一致性率。

Result: 在21个皮肤病案例评估中，精确一致性达到71.4%，语义相似性保持一致；结构化跨类别和差异重叠分析显示100%综合一致性；没有案例显示完全诊断分歧。

Conclusion: 二元词汇评估明显低估了临床意义的对齐度。将专家验证建模为结构化转换，能够量化修正动态，支持对影像临床决策支持系统进行可追溯、人机对齐的评估。

Abstract: Human-in-the-loop validation is essential in safety-critical clinical AI, yet the transition between initial model inference and expert correction is rarely analyzed as a structured signal. We introduce a diagnostic alignment framework in which the AI-generated image based report is preserved as an immutable inference state and systematically compared with the physician-validated outcome. The inference pipeline integrates a vision-enabled large language model, BERT- based medical entity extraction, and a Sequential Language Model Inference (SLMI) step to enforce domain-consistent refinement prior to expert review. Evaluation on 21 dermatological cases (21 complete AI physician pairs) em- ployed a four-level concordance framework comprising exact primary match rate (PMR), semantic similarity-adjusted rate (AMR), cross-category alignment, and Comprehensive Concordance Rate (CCR). Exact agreement reached 71.4% and remained unchanged under semantic similarity (t = 0.60), while structured cross-category and differential overlap analysis yielded 100% comprehensive concordance (95% CI: [83.9%, 100%]). No cases demonstrated complete diagnostic divergence. These findings show that binary lexical evaluation substantially un- derestimates clinically meaningful alignment. Modeling expert validation as a structured transformation enables signal-aware quantification of correction dynamics and supports traceable, human aligned evaluation of image based clinical decision support systems.

Abstract: Decoding brain activity from electroencephalography (EEG) is crucial for neuroscience and clinical applications. Among recent advances in deep learning for EEG, geometric learning stands out as its theoretical underpinnings on symmetric positive definite (SPD) allows revealing structural connectivity analysis in a physics-grounded manner. However, current SPD-based methods focus predominantly on statistical aggregation of EEGs, with frequency-specific synchronization and local topological structures of brain regions neglected. Given this, we propose RepSPD, a novel geometric deep learning (GDL)-based model. RepSPD implements a cross-attention mechanism on the Riemannian manifold to modulate the geometric attributes of SPD with graph-derived functional connectivity features. On top of this, we introduce a global bidirectional alignment strategy to reshape tangent-space embeddings, mitigating geometric distortions caused by curvature and thereby enhancing geometric consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms existing EEG representation methods, exhibiting superior robustness and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used, their security risks have drawn increasing attention. Existing research reveals that LLMs are highly susceptible to jailbreak attacks, with effectiveness varying across language contexts. This paper investigates the role of classical Chinese in jailbreak attacks. Owing to its conciseness and obscurity, classical Chinese can partially bypass existing safety constraints, exposing notable vulnerabilities in LLMs. Based on this observation, this paper proposes a framework, CC-BOS, for the automatic generation of classical Chinese adversarial prompts based on multi-dimensional fruit fly optimization, facilitating efficient and automated jailbreak attacks in black-box settings. Prompts are encoded into eight policy dimensions-covering role, behavior, mechanism, metaphor, expression, knowledge, trigger pattern and context; and iteratively refined via smell search, visual search, and cauchy mutation. This design enables efficient exploration of the search space, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of black-box jailbreak attacks. To enhance readability and evaluation accuracy, we further design a classical Chinese to English translation module. Extensive experiments demonstrate that effectiveness of the proposed CC-BOS, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art jailbreak attack methods.

Abstract: The Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), a fundamental combinatorial optimization challenge, focuses on optimizing fleet operations under vehicle capacity constraints. While extensively studied in operational research, the NP-hard nature of CVRP continues to pose significant computational challenges, particularly for large-scale instances. This study presents AILS-AHD (Adaptive Iterated Local Search with Automatic Heuristic Design), a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to revolutionize CVRP solving. Our methodology integrates an evolutionary search framework with LLMs to dynamically generate and optimize ruin heuristics within the AILS method. Additionally, we introduce an LLM-based acceleration mechanism to enhance computational efficiency. Comprehensive experimental evaluations against state-of-the-art solvers, including AILS-II and HGS, demonstrate the superior performance of AILS-AHD across both moderate and large-scale instances. Notably, our approach establishes new best-known solutions for 8 out of 10 instances in the CVRPLib large-scale benchmark, underscoring the potential of LLM-driven heuristic design in advancing the field of vehicle routing optimization.

Motivation: 注意力经济中，煽情内容使消费者面临过度情感刺激，阻碍冷静决策，需要一种既能降低情感刺激又不限制原始文本访问的信息净化系统

Method: 构建包含四个智能体（情感分析、情感调整、平衡监控、个人指导）的多智能体系统。情感分析使用6情绪BERT分类器量化刺激强度；情感调整使用LLM将文本改写为BALANCED和COOL两种呈现模式；平衡监控聚合周度信息消费模式并生成个性化建议；个人指导根据消费者敏感性推荐呈现模式

Result: 在800篇AG News文章上测试显示：刺激分数显著降低（最高19.3%），情感平衡改善，语义保持良好。刺激降低与语义保持接近零相关性表明二者可独立控制。类别分析显示体育、商业、科技类别刺激降低17.8-33.8%，但世界类别效果有限（因事实本身具有高刺激）

Conclusion: MALLET系统提供了一个支持消费者冷静接收信息的框架，在不限制访问原始文本的前提下有效降低情感刺激，为信息消费环境提供了实用的情感净化解决方案

Abstract: In the attention economy, sensational content exposes consumers to excessive emotional stimulation, hindering calm decision-making. This study proposes Multi-Agent LLM-based Emotional deToxification (MALLET), a multi-agent information sanitization system consisting of four agents: Emotion Analysis, Emotion Adjustment, Balance Monitoring, and Personal Guide. The Emotion Analysis Agent quantifies stimulus intensity using a 6-emotion BERT classifier, and the Emotion Adjustment Agent rewrites texts into two presentation modes, BALANCED (neutralized text) and COOL (neutralized text + supplementary text), using an LLM. The Balance Monitoring Agent aggregates weekly information consumption patterns and generates personalized advice, while the Personal Guide Agent recommends a presentation mode according to consumer sensitivity. Experiments on 800 AG News articles demonstrated significant stimulus score reduction (up to 19.3%) and improved emotion balance while maintaining semantic preservation. Near-zero correlation between stimulus reduction and semantic preservation confirmed that the two are independently controllable. Category-level analysis revealed substantial reduction (17.8-33.8%) in Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech, whereas the effect was limited in the World category, where facts themselves are inherently high-stimulus. The proposed system provides a framework for supporting calm information reception of consumers without restricting access to the original text.

Recent advancements represented by video generation models like Sora have demonstrated the potential of data-driven scaling laws to approximate physical dynamics, while the emerging Unified Multimodal Model (UMM) offers a promising architectural paradigm for integrating perception, language, and reasoning. Despite these advances, the field still lacks a principled theoretical framework that defines the essential properties requisite for a General World Model. In this paper, we propose that a World Model must be grounded in the Trinity of Consistency: Modal Consistency as the semantic interface, Spatial Consistency as the geometric basis, and Temporal Consistency as the causal engine. Through this tripartite lens, we systematically review the evolution of multimodal learning, revealing a trajectory from loosely coupled specialized modules toward unified architectures that enable the synergistic emergence of internal world simulators. To complement this conceptual framework, we introduce CoW-Bench, a benchmark centered on multi-frame reasoning and generation scenarios. CoW-Bench evaluates both video generation models and UMMs under a unified evaluation protocol. Our work establishes a principled pathway toward general world models, clarifying both the limitations of current systems and the architectural requirements for future progress.

Motivation: 解决现有LLM方法无法捕捉时间序列中的趋势和季节性模式，以及简单任务主导学习而阻碍深度推理能力的问题

Method: 提出的PATRA模型包含：1）模式感知机制从时间序列中提取趋势和季节性模式以实现深度对齐；2）任务感知平衡奖励机制来协调不同难度任务的学习，激励生成连贯的思维链

Result: 大量实验表明PATRA在多种时间序列问答任务上优于强基线方法，展现出卓越的跨模态理解和推理能力

Conclusion: PATRA通过模式感知对齐和平衡推理设计，有效解决了时间序列推理中的模式捕捉和深度推理问题，为时序问答任务提供了新解决方案

Abstract: Time series reasoning demands both the perception of complex dynamics and logical depth. However, existing LLM-based approaches exhibit two limitations: they often treat time series merely as text or images, failing to capture the patterns like trends and seasonalities needed to answer specific questions; and when trained on a mix of simple and complex tasks, simpler objectives often dominate the learning process, hindering the development of deep reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose the Pattern-Aware Alignment and Balanced Reasoning model (PATRA), introducing a pattern-aware mechanism that extracts trend and seasonality patterns from time series to achieve deep alignment. Furthermore, we design a task-aware balanced reward to harmonize learning across tasks of varying difficulty, incentivizing the generation of coherent Chains of Thought. Extensive experiments show that PATRA outperforms strong baselines across diverse Time Series Question Answering (TSQA) tasks, demonstrating superior cross-modal understanding and reasoning capability.

TL;DR: 提出了SC-ARENA——一个针对单细胞基础模型的自然语言评估框架，通过虚拟细胞抽象统一评估目标，包含五个NL任务，并引入知识增强评估来解决传统指标的不稳定和不可解释性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在单细胞生物学中的评估实践存在不足：基准测试碎片化、任务格式脱离实际应用（如多项选择）、缺乏可解释性和生物学基础的指标。需要更统一、可解释且生物意义准确的评估框架。

Method: 1. 提出虚拟细胞抽象统一评估目标 2. 定义5个自然语言任务（细胞类型注释、描述、生成、扰动预测、科学问答） 3. 引入知识增强评估，结合外部本体、标记数据库和科学文献 4. 对通用和领域专用LLM进行实验分析

Result: 1. 在虚拟细胞统一评估下，现有模型在生物复杂任务上表现不均衡，特别是在需要机制或因果理解的任务上 2. 知识增强评估确保了生物正确性，提供可解释的、基于证据的理由，并实现了高区分能力，克服了传统指标的脆弱性和不透明性

Conclusion: SC-ARENA为评估单细胞生物学中的LLM提供了统一且可解释的框架，有助于开发与生物学一致、可泛化的基础模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in scientific research, offering new capabilities for knowledge discovery and reasoning. In single-cell biology, however, evaluation practices for both general and specialized LLMs remain inadequate: existing benchmarks are fragmented across tasks, adopt formats such as multiple-choice classification that diverge from real-world usage, and rely on metrics lacking interpretability and biological grounding. We present SC-ARENA, a natural language evaluation framework tailored to single-cell foundation models. SC-ARENA formalizes a virtual cell abstraction that unifies evaluation targets by representing both intrinsic attributes and gene-level interactions. Within this paradigm, we define five natural language tasks (cell type annotation, captioning, generation, perturbation prediction, and scientific QA) that probe core reasoning capabilities in cellular biology. To overcome the limitations of brittle string-matching metrics, we introduce knowledge-augmented evaluation, which incorporates external ontologies, marker databases, and scientific literature to support biologically faithful and interpretable judgments. Experiments and analysis across both general-purpose and domain-specialized LLMs demonstrate that (i) under the Virtual Cell unified evaluation paradigm, current models achieve uneven performance on biologically complex tasks, particularly those demanding mechanistic or causal understanding; and (ii) our knowledge-augmented evaluation framework ensures biological correctness, provides interpretable, evidence-grounded rationales, and achieves high discriminative capacity, overcoming the brittleness and opacity of conventional metrics. SC-Arena thus provides a unified and interpretable framework for assessing LLMs in single-cell biology, pointing toward the development of biology-aligned, generalizable foundation models.

Abstract: Indicator-based approaches to machine consciousness recommend mechanism-linked evidence triangulated across tasks, supported by architectural inspection and causal intervention. Inspired by Humphrey's ipsundrum hypothesis, we implement ReCoN-Ipsundrum, an inspectable agent that extends a ReCoN state machine with a recurrent persistence loop over sensory salience Ns and an optional affect proxy reporting valence/arousal. Across fixed-parameter ablations (ReCoN, Ipsundrum, Ipsundrum+affect), we operationalize Humphrey's qualiaphilia (preference for sensory experience for its own sake) as a familiarity-controlled scenic-over-dull route choice. We find a novelty dissociation: non-affect variants are novelty-sensitive (Delta scenic-entry = 0.07). Affect coupling is stable (Delta scenic-entry = 0.01) even when scenic is less novel (median Delta novelty ~ -0.43). In reward-free exploratory play, the affect variant shows structured local investigation (scan events 31.4 vs. 0.9; cycle score 7.6). In a pain-tail probe, only the affect variant sustains prolonged planned caution (tail duration 90 vs. 5). Lesioning feedback+integration selectively reduces post-stimulus persistence in ipsundrum variants (AUC drop 27.62, 27.9%) while leaving ReCoN unchanged. These dissociations link recurrence -> persistence and affect-coupled control -> preference stability, scanning, and lingering caution, illustrating how indicator-like signatures can be engineered and why mechanistic and causal evidence should accompany behavioral markers.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: AI systems are increasingly deployed in high-stakes contexts -- medical diagnosis, legal research, financial analysis -- under the assumption they can be governed by norms. This paper demonstrates that assumption is formally invalid for optimization-based systems, specifically Large Language Models trained via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). We establish that genuine agency requires two necessary and jointly sufficient architectural conditions: the capacity to maintain certain boundaries as non-negotiable constraints rather than tradeable weights (Incommensurability), and a non-inferential mechanism capable of suspending processing when those boundaries are threatened (Apophatic Responsiveness). These conditions apply across all normative domains.
  RLHF-based systems are constitutively incompatible with both conditions. The operations that make optimization powerful -- unifying all values on a scalar metric and always selecting the highest-scoring output -- are precisely the operations that preclude normative governance. This incompatibility is not a correctable training bug awaiting a technical fix; it is a formal constraint inherent to what optimization is. Consequently, documented failure modes - sycophancy, hallucination, and unfaithful reasoning - are not accidents but structural manifestations.
  Misaligned deployment triggers a second-order risk we term the Convergence Crisis: when humans are forced to verify AI outputs under metric pressure, they degrade from genuine agents into criteria-checking optimizers, eliminating the only component in the system capable of normative accountability. Beyond the incompatibility proof, the paper's primary positive contribution is a substrate-neutral architectural specification defining what any system -- biological, artificial, or institutional -- must satisfy to qualify as an agent rather than a sophisticated instrument.

Abstract: As large language models become increasingly capable, it is critical that their outputs can be easily checked by less capable systems. Prover-verifier games can be used to improve checkability of model outputs, but display a degradation in accuracy compared to a baseline trained only to maximize correctness -- a phenonemon named legibility tax. We propose a solution by decoupling the correctness from the checkability condition and instead training a "translator" model that turns a fixed solver model's solution into a checkable form. This allows us to first train the solver to maximize correctness, and then train the translator to translate the solver into a checkable form while retaining the solver's answer. To accommodate this new objective of translation, we formulate a decoupled prover-verifier game where the equilibria correspond to faithful and checkable translators.

Conclusion: AgentDropoutV2框架能够有效减少多智能体系统中的错误传播，提高推理准确性，且无需重新训练，具备良好的部署灵活性和适应性。代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: While Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) excel in complex reasoning, they suffer from the cascading impact of erroneous information generated by individual participants. Current solutions often resort to rigid structural engineering or expensive fine-tuning, limiting their deployability and adaptability. We propose AgentDropoutV2, a test-time rectify-or-reject pruning framework designed to dynamically optimize MAS information flow without retraining. Our approach acts as an active firewall, intercepting agent outputs and employing a retrieval-augmented rectifier to iteratively correct errors based on a failure-driven indicator pool. This mechanism allows for the precise identification of potential errors using distilled failure patterns as prior knowledge. Irreparable outputs are subsequently pruned to prevent error propagation, while a fallback strategy preserves system integrity. Empirical results on extensive math benchmarks show that AgentDropoutV2 significantly boosts the MAS's task performance, achieving an average accuracy gain of 6.3 percentage points on math benchmarks. Furthermore, the system exhibits robust generalization and adaptivity, dynamically modulating rectification efforts based on task difficulty while leveraging context-aware indicators to resolve a wide spectrum of error patterns. Our code and dataset are released at https://github.com/TonySY2/AgentDropoutV2.

Abstract: Chest X-ray plays a central role in thoracic diagnosis, and its interpretation inherently requires multi-step, evidence-grounded reasoning. However, large vision-language models (LVLMs) often generate plausible responses that are not faithfully grounded in diagnostic evidence and provide limited visual evidence for verification, while also requiring costly retraining to support new diagnostic tasks, limiting their reliability and adaptability in clinical settings. To address these limitations, we present CXReasonAgent, a diagnostic agent that integrates a large language model (LLM) with clinically grounded diagnostic tools to perform evidence-grounded diagnostic reasoning using image-derived diagnostic and visual evidence. To evaluate these capabilities, we introduce CXReasonDial, a multi-turn dialogue benchmark with 1,946 dialogues across 12 diagnostic tasks, and show that CXReasonAgent produces faithfully grounded responses, enabling more reliable and verifiable diagnostic reasoning than LVLMs. These findings highlight the importance of integrating clinically grounded diagnostic tools, particularly in safety-critical clinical settings.

Abstract: Modeling neural population dynamics is crucial for foundational neuroscientific research and various clinical applications. Conventional latent variable methods typically model continuous brain dynamics through discretizing time with recurrent architecture, which necessarily results in compounded cumulative prediction errors and failure of capturing instantaneous, nonlinear characteristics of EEGs. We propose ODEBRAIN, a Neural ODE latent dynamic forecasting framework to overcome these challenges by integrating spatio-temporal-frequency features into spectral graph nodes, followed by a Neural ODE modeling the continuous latent dynamics. Our design ensures that latent representations can capture stochastic variations of complex brain states at any given time point. Extensive experiments verify that ODEBRAIN can improve significantly over existing methods in forecasting EEG dynamics with enhanced robustness and generalization capabilities.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: For each axiom of KM belief update we provide a corresponding axiom in a modal logic containing three modal operators: a unimodal belief operator $B$, a bimodal conditional operator $>$ and the unimodal necessity operator $\square$. We then compare the resulting logic to the similar logic obtained from converting the AGM axioms of belief revision into modal axioms and show that the latter contains the former. Denoting the latter by $\mathcal L_{AGM}$ and the former by $\mathcal L_{KM}$ we show that every axiom of $\mathcal L_{KM}$ is a theorem of $\mathcal L_{AGM}$. Thus AGM belief revision can be seen as a special case of KM belief update. For the strong version of KM belief update we show that the difference between $\mathcal L_{KM}$ and $\mathcal L_{AGM}$ can be narrowed down to a single axiom, which deals exclusively with unsurprising information, that is, with formulas that were not initially disbelieved.

Motivation: 即使经过优化的AI模型也会由于偶然性和认知不确定性而产生推理错误。作者发现，当基于输入的多个不变变换进行推理时，认知不确定性会导致推理错误出现部分独立性，这为改进推理精度提供了机会。

Method: 提出'重采样'推理方法：对训练好的AI模型应用输入的多重变换版本，然后聚合这些推理输出以获得更准确的结果。该方法利用了变换后推理结果之间的部分独立性。

Result: 该方法能够潜在地提高推理准确度，并为平衡模型大小与性能提供了一种策略。

Conclusion: 利用认知不确定性导致的推理错误的部分独立性，通过重采样和聚合的方法可以改进AI模型的推理性能，在模型大小和准确率之间找到更好的平衡。

Abstract: An artificial intelligence (AI) model can be viewed as a function that maps inputs to outputs in high-dimensional spaces. Once designed and well trained, the AI model is applied for inference. However, even optimized AI models can produce inference errors due to aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. Interestingly, we observed that when inferring multiple samples based on invariant transformations of an input, inference errors can show partial independences due to epistemic uncertainty. Leveraging this insight, we propose a "resampling" based inferencing that applies to a trained AI model with multiple transformed versions of an input, and aggregates inference outputs to a more accurate result. This approach has the potential to improve inference accuracy and offers a strategy for balancing model size and performance.

Conclusion: 提出的新算法在保持GRAVE算法性能的同时，通过减少内存使用解决了其在内存受限环境中的实用性限制问题。

Abstract: Generalized Rapid Action Value Estimation (GRAVE) has been shown to be a strong variant within the Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) family of algorithms for General Game Playing (GGP). However, its reliance on storing additional win/visit statistics at each node makes its use impractical in memory-constrained environments, thereby limiting its applicability in practice. In this paper, we introduce the GRAVE2, GRAVER and GRAVER2 algorithms, which extend GRAVE through two-level search, node recycling, and a combination of both techniques, respectively. We show that these enhancements enable a drastic reduction in the number of stored nodes while matching the playing strength of GRAVE.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) perform increasingly well on biology benchmarks, but it remains unclear whether they uplift novice users -- i.e., enable humans to perform better than with internet-only resources. This uncertainty is central to understanding both scientific acceleration and dual-use risk. We conducted a multi-model, multi-benchmark human uplift study comparing novices with LLM access versus internet-only access across eight biosecurity-relevant task sets. Participants worked on complex problems with ample time (up to 13 hours for the most involved tasks). We found that LLM access provided substantial uplift: novices with LLMs were 4.16 times more accurate than controls (95% CI [2.63, 6.87]). On four benchmarks with available expert baselines (internet-only), novices with LLMs outperformed experts on three of them. Perhaps surprisingly, standalone LLMs often exceeded LLM-assisted novices, indicating that users were not eliciting the strongest available contributions from the LLMs. Most participants (89.6%) reported little difficulty obtaining dual-use-relevant information despite safeguards. Overall, LLMs substantially uplift novices on biological tasks previously reserved for trained practitioners, underscoring the need for sustained, interactive uplift evaluations alongside traditional benchmarks.

Conclusion: 这些发现为在实际交易系统中应用LLM智能体时的智能体结构和任务配置设计提供了重要参考，强调了细粒度分解和决策对齐的重要性。

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has accelerated the development of autonomous financial trading systems. While mainstream approaches deploy multi-agent systems mimicking analyst and manager roles, they often rely on abstract instructions that overlook the intricacies of real-world workflows, which can lead to degraded inference performance and less transparent decision-making. Therefore, we propose a multi-agent LLM trading framework that explicitly decomposes investment analysis into fine-grained tasks, rather than providing coarse-grained instructions. We evaluate the proposed framework using Japanese stock data, including prices, financial statements, news, and macro information, under a leakage-controlled backtesting setting. Experimental results show that fine-grained task decomposition significantly improves risk-adjusted returns compared to conventional coarse-grained designs. Crucially, further analysis of intermediate agent outputs suggests that alignment between analytical outputs and downstream decision preferences is a critical driver of system performance. Moreover, we conduct standard portfolio optimization, exploiting low correlation with the stock index and the variance of each system's output. This approach achieves superior performance. These findings contribute to the design of agent structure and task configuration when applying LLM agents to trading systems in practical settings.

Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) exhibit perceptual fragility when confronted with visually complex scenes. This weakness stems from a reliance on finite training datasets, which are prohibitively expensive to scale and impose a ceiling on model robustness. We introduce \textbf{AOT-SFT}, a large-scale adversarial dataset for bootstrapping MLLM robustness. Building on this, we propose \textbf{AOT (Adversarial Opponent Training)}, a self-play framework that forges MLLM robustness by creating its own training data. Our method orchestrates a co-evolution between an image-editing Attacker and a Defender MLLM, where the Attacker generates a diverse and dynamic curriculum of image manipulations, forcing the Defender to adapt and improve. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AOT enhances the Defender's perceptual robustness and reduces hallucinations, establishing a scalable paradigm for training more reliable MLLMs.

Abstract: General-purpose 3D chemical modeling encompasses molecules and materials, requiring both generative and predictive capabilities. However, most existing AI approaches are optimized for a single domain (molecules or materials) and a single task (generation or prediction), which limits representation sharing and transfer. We introduce Zatom-1, the first foundation model that unifies generative and predictive learning of 3D molecules and materials. Zatom-1 is a Transformer trained with a multimodal flow matching objective that jointly models discrete atom types and continuous 3D geometries. This approach supports scalable pretraining with predictable gains as model capacity increases, while enabling fast and stable sampling. We use joint generative pretraining as a universal initialization for downstream multi-task prediction of properties, energies, and forces. Empirically, Zatom-1 matches or outperforms specialized baselines on both generative and predictive benchmarks, while reducing the generative inference time by more than an order of magnitude. Our experiments demonstrate positive predictive transfer between chemical domains from joint generative pretraining: modeling materials during pretraining improves molecular property prediction accuracy.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce a sequence modeling framework in which the latent state is a complex-valued wave function evolving on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space under a learned, time-dependent Hamiltonian. Unlike standard recurrent architectures that rely on gating mechanisms to suppress competing hypotheses, our framework utilizes quantum interference: the Hamiltonian steers the phases of complex amplitudes so that conflicting interpretations cancel while compatible ones reinforce. The dynamics are strictly unitary, ensuring that the state norm is preserved exactly at every time step via a Cayley (Crank--Nicolson) discretization. Token probabilities are extracted using the Born rule, a quadratic measurement operator that couples magnitudes and relative phases. Our primary theoretical contribution is a separation theorem characterizing the representational advantage of this readout: we define a family of disambiguation tasks that a complex unitary model of dimension $N$ solves exactly, but which requires a state dimension of $Ω(N^2)$ for any real-valued orthogonal model equipped with a standard affine-softmax readout. This quadratic gap arises because the Born rule implicitly lifts the $N$-dimensional state into the space of rank-one Hermitian matrices, accessing pairwise phase correlations that are inaccessible to linear projections. Finally, we derive a continuity equation for the latent probability mass, yielding conserved pairwise currents that serve as a built-in diagnostic for tracing information flow between dimensions.

Abstract: Can an LLM learn how an optimizer behaves -- and use that knowledge to control it? We extend Code World Models (CWMs), LLM-synthesized Python programs that predict environment dynamics, from deterministic games to stochastic combinatorial optimization. Given suboptimal trajectories of $(1{+}1)$-$\text{RLS}_k$, the LLM synthesizes a simulator of the optimizer's dynamics; greedy planning over this simulator then selects the mutation strength $k$ at each step. On \lo{} and \onemax{}, CWM-greedy performs within 6\% of the theoretically optimal policy -- without ever seeing optimal-policy trajectories. On \jump{$_k$}, where a deceptive valley causes all adaptive baselines to fail (0\% success rate), CWM-greedy achieves 100\% success rate -- without any collection policy using oracle knowledge of the gap parameter. On the NK-Landscape, where no closed-form model exists, CWM-greedy outperforms all baselines across fifteen independently generated instances ($36.94$ vs.\ $36.32$; $p<0.001$) when the prompt includes empirical transition statistics. The CWM also outperforms DQN in sample efficiency (200 offline trajectories vs.\ 500 online episodes), success rate (100\% vs.\ 58\%), and generalization ($k{=}3$: 78\% vs.\ 0\%). Robustness experiments confirm stable synthesis across 5 independent runs.

Abstract: Large language models have become central to many AI applications, but their growing energy consumption raises serious sustainability concerns. A key limitation in current AI deployments is the reliance on a one-size-fits-all inference strategy where most systems route every request to the same large model, regardless of task complexity, leading to substantial and unnecessary energy waste. To address this issue, we propose a context-aware model switching approach that dynamically selects an appropriate language model based on query complexity. The proposed system uses a Context-Aware Model Switching for Energy-Efficient LLM Inference that combines caching for repeated queries, rulebased complexity scoring for fast and explainable decisions, machine learning classification to capture semantic intent, and a user-adaptive component that learns from interaction patterns over time. The proposed architecture was evaluated using real conversation workloads and three open-source language models (Gemma3 1B, Gemma3 4B and Qwen3 4B) with different computational costs, measuring energy consumption (via NVML GPU power telemetry), response latency, routing accuracy, and output quality (BERTScore F1) to reflect real-world usage conditions. Experimental results show that the model switching approach can reduce energy consumption by up to 67.5% compared to always using the largest model while maintaining a response quality of 93.6%. In addition, the response time for simple queries also improved significantly by approximately 68%. These results show that model switching inference offers a practical and scalable path toward more energy-efficient and sustainable AI systems, demonstrating that significant efficiency gains can be achieved without major sacrifices in response quality.

TL;DR: 论文提出熵控制流匹配（ECFM），通过熵率约束优化流匹配轨迹的信息几何特性，解决标准流匹配中可能出现的低熵瓶颈和语义模式消耗问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准流匹配方法虽然性能强大，但未能直接控制轨迹的信息几何特性，可能导致低熵瓶颈，从而在时间维度上暂时耗尽语义模式，影响生成质量。

Method: ECFM引入连续性方程路径上的约束变分原理，强制执行全局熵率预算约束（d/dt H(μ_t) ≥ -λ），这是一个Wasserstein空间中的凸优化问题，具有KKT/Pontryagin系统，并可用随机控制表示等价于具有显式熵乘子的Schrödinger桥问题。

Result: ECFM在纯输运状态下恢复熵最优输运测地线，并在λ→0时Γ-收敛到经典最优输运；获得了具有Lipschitz稳定性的模式覆盖和密度下界保证，并为无约束流匹配构造了近最优的坍塌反例。

Conclusion: ECFM通过熵控制解决了流匹配中的模式覆盖问题，提供了理论保证和几何洞察，同时与最优输运理论建立了自然联系。

Abstract: Modern vision generators transport a base distribution to data through time-indexed measures, implemented as deterministic flows (ODEs) or stochastic diffusions (SDEs). Despite strong empirical performance, standard flow-matching objectives do not directly control the information geometry of the trajectory, allowing low-entropy bottlenecks that can transiently deplete semantic modes. We propose Entropy-Controlled Flow Matching (ECFM): a constrained variational principle over continuity-equation paths enforcing a global entropy-rate budget d/dt H(mu_t) >= -lambda. ECFM is a convex optimization in Wasserstein space with a KKT/Pontryagin system, and admits a stochastic-control representation equivalent to a Schrodinger bridge with an explicit entropy multiplier. In the pure transport regime, ECFM recovers entropic OT geodesics and Gamma-converges to classical OT as lambda -> 0. We further obtain certificate-style mode-coverage and density-floor guarantees with Lipschitz stability, and construct near-optimal collapse counterexamples for unconstrained flow matching.

Abstract: In matching markets such as kidney exchanges and freight exchanges, delayed matching has been shown to improve overall market efficiency. The benefits of delay are highly sensitive to participants' sojourn times and departure behavior, and delaying matches can impose significant costs, including longer waiting times and increased market congestion. These competing effects make fixed matching policies inherently inflexible in dynamic environments. We propose a learning-based Hybrid framework that adaptively combines immediate and delayed matching. The framework continuously collects data on user departures over time, estimates the underlying departure distribution via regression, and determines whether to delay matching in the subsequent period based on a decision threshold that governs the system's tolerance for matching efficiency loss. The proposed framework can substantially reduce waiting times and congestion while sacrificing only a limited amount of matching efficiency. By dynamically adjusting its matching strategy, the Hybrid framework enables system performance to flexibly interpolate between purely greedy and purely patient policies, offering a robust and adaptive alternative to static matching mechanisms.

Abstract: The real-time supervision of production processes is a common challenge across several industries. It targets process component monitoring and its predictive maintenance in order to ensure safety, uninterrupted production and maintain high efficiency level. The rise of advanced tools for the simulation of physical systems in addition to data-driven machine learning models offers the possibility to design numerical tools dedicated to efficient system monitoring. In that respect, the digital twin concept presents an adequate framework that proffers solution to these challenges. The main purpose of this paper is to develop such a digital twin dedicated to fault detection and diagnosis in the context of a thermal-hydraulic process supervision. Based on a numerical simulation of the system, in addition to machine learning methods, we propose different modules dedicated to process parameter change detection and their on-line estimation. The proposed fault detection and diagnosis algorithm is validated on a specific test scenario, with single one-off parameter change occurrences in the system. The numerical results show good accuracy in terms of parameter variation localization and the update of their values.

TL;DR: AutoQRA是一个联合优化框架，能够在混合量化微调过程中同时优化各层的比特宽度和LoRA秩配置，以解决量化位宽与LoRA秩之间复杂交互关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的后适应范式（先量化再进行参数高效微调）未能充分利用量化位宽与LoRA秩之间的复杂交互关系。精心优化的量化分配方案不一定能转化为良好的微调性能，不同的位宽和秩配置在相同内存预算下可能导致显著不同的结果。

Method: AutoQRA采用两阶段优化：1）全局多保真度进化搜索，通过注入层重要性先验进行初始化，使用特定算子和性能模型筛选候选配置；2）局部信任域贝叶斯优化，细化搜索空间中有前景的区域，在给定内存预算下找到最优配置。这种方法能够在训练过程中主动补偿特定层的量化噪声。

Result: 实验表明，AutoQRA能够实现接近全精度微调的性能，同时内存占用与均匀4位量化方法相当。

Conclusion: AutoQRA通过联合优化量化位宽和LoRA秩配置，有效解决了量化与微调之间的交互问题，在有限内存约束下实现了接近全精度微调的性能。

Abstract: Quantization followed by parameter-efficient fine-tuning has emerged as a promising paradigm for downstream adaptation under tight GPU memory constraints. However, this sequential pipeline fails to leverage the intricate interaction between quantization bit-width and LoRA rank. Specifically, a carefully optimized quantization allocation with low quantization error does not always translate to strong fine-tuning performance, and different bit-width and rank configurations can lead to significantly varying outcomes under the same memory budget. To address this limitation, we propose AutoQRA, a joint optimization framework that simultaneously optimizes the bit-width and LoRA rank configuration for each layer during the mixed quantized fine-tuning process. To tackle the challenges posed by the large discrete search space and the high evaluation cost associated with frequent fine-tuning iterations, AutoQRA decomposes the optimization process into two stages. First, it first conducts a global multi-fidelity evolutionary search, where the initial population is warm-started by injecting layer-wise importance priors. This stage employs specific operators and a performance model to efficiently screen candidate configurations. Second, trust-region Bayesian optimization is applied to locally refine promising regions of the search space and identify optimal configurations under the given memory budget. This approach enables active compensation for quantization noise in specific layers during training. Experiments show that AutoQRA achieves performance close to full-precision fine-tuning with a memory footprint comparable to uniform 4-bit methods.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing raw data. However, shared local model updates remain vulnerable to inference and poisoning attacks. Secure aggregation schemes have been proposed to mitigate these attacks. In this work, we aim to understand how these techniques are implemented in quantum-assisted FL. Quantum Secure Aggregation (QSA) has been proposed, offering information-theoretic privacy by encoding client updates into the global phase of multipartite entangled states. Existing QSA protocols, however, rely on a single global Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state shared among all participating clients. This design poses fundamental challenges: fidelity of large-scale GHZ states deteriorates rapidly with the increasing number of clients; and (ii) the global aggregation prevents the detection of Byzantine clients. We propose Clustered Quantum Secure Aggregation (CQSA), a modular aggregation framework that reconciles the physical constraints of near-term quantum hardware along with the need for Byzantine-robustness in FL. CQSA randomly partitions the clients into small clusters, each performing local quantum aggregation using high-fidelity, low-qubit GHZ states. The server analyzes statistical relationships between cluster-level aggregates employing common statistical measures such as cosine similarity and Euclidean distance to identify malicious contributions. Through theoretical analysis and simulations under depolarizing noise, we demonstrate that CQSA ensures stable model convergence, achieves superior state fidelity over global QSA.

Abstract: Spatio-temporal epidemic forecasting is critical for public health management, yet existing methods often struggle with insensitivity to weak epidemic signals, over-simplified spatial relations, and unstable parameter estimation. To address these challenges, we propose the Spatio-Temporal priOr-aware Epidemic Predictor (STOEP), a novel hybrid framework that integrates implicit spatio-temporal priors and explicit expert priors. STOEP consists of three key components: (1) Case-aware Adjacency Learning (CAL), which dynamically adjusts mobility-based regional dependencies using historical infection patterns; (2) Space-informed Parameter Estimating (SPE), which employs learnable spatial priors to amplify weak epidemic signals; and (3) Filter-based Mechanistic Forecasting (FMF), which uses an expert-guided adaptive thresholding strategy to regularize epidemic parameters. Extensive experiments on real-world COVID-19 and influenza datasets demonstrate that STOEP outperforms the best baseline by 11.1% in RMSE. The system has been deployed at one provincial CDC in China to facilitate downstream applications.

Abstract: Self-attention is usually described as a flexible, content-adaptive way to mix a token with information from its past. We re-interpret causal self-attention transformers, the backbone of modern foundation models, within a probabilistic framework, much like how classical PCA is extended to probabilistic PCA. However, this re-formulation reveals a surprising and deeper structural insight: due to a change-of-variables phenomenon, a barrier constraint emerges on the self-attention parameters. This induces a highly structured geometry on the token space, providing theoretical insights into the dynamics of LLM decoding. This reveals a boundary where attention becomes ill-conditioned, leading to a margin interpretation similar to classical support vector machines. Just like support vectors, this naturally gives rise to the concept of support tokens.
  Furthermore, we show that LLMs can be interpreted as a stochastic process over the power set of the token space, providing a rigorous probabilistic framework for sequence modeling. We propose a Bayesian framework and derive a MAP estimation objective that requires only a minimal modification to standard LLM training: the addition of a smooth log-barrier penalty to the usual cross-entropy loss. We demonstrate that this provides more robust models without sacrificing out-of-sample accuracy and that it is straightforward to incorporate in practice.

Abstract: AI-native architectures are vital for 6G wireless communications. The black-box nature and high complexity of deep learning models employed in critical applications, such as channel estimation, limit their practical deployment. While perturbation-based XAI solutions offer input filtering, they often neglect internal structural optimization. We propose X-REFINE, an XAI-based framework for joint input-filtering and architecture fine-tuning. By utilizing a decomposition-based, sign-stabilized LRP epsilon rule, X-REFINE backpropagates predictions to derive high-resolution relevance scores for both subcarriers and hidden neurons. This enables a holistic optimization that identifies the most faithful model components. Simulation results demonstrate that X-REFINE achieves a superior interpretability-performance-complexity trade-off, significantly reducing computational complexity while maintaining robust bit error rate (BER) performance across different scenarios.

Abstract: Cardiovascular disease is the primary cause of death globally, necessitating early identification, precise risk classification, and dependable decision-support technologies. The advent of large language models (LLMs) provides new zero-shot and few-shot reasoning capabilities, even though machine learning (ML) algorithms, especially ensemble approaches like Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, are excellent at modeling complex, non-linear patient data and routinely beat logistic regression. This research predicts cardiovascular disease using a merged dataset of 1,190 patient records, comparing traditional machine learning models (95.78% accuracy, ROC-AUC 0.96) with open-source large language models via OpenRouter APIs. Finally, a hybrid fusion of the ML ensemble and LLM reasoning under Gemini 2.5 Flash achieved the best results (96.62% accuracy, 0.97 AUC), showing that LLMs (78.9 % accuracy) work best when combined with ML models rather than used alone. Results show that ML ensembles achieved the highest performance (95.78% accuracy, ROC-AUC 0.96), while LLMs performed moderately in zero-shot (78.9%) and slightly better in few-shot (72.6%) settings. The proposed hybrid method enhanced the strength in uncertain situations, illustrating that ensemble ML is considered the best structured tabular prediction case, but it can be integrated with hybrid ML-LLM systems to provide a minor increase and open the way to more reliable clinical decision-support tools.

Abstract: Objective: The objective of this study is to develop a machine learning (ML)-based framework for early risk stratification of clinical trials (CTs) according to their likelihood of exhibiting a high rate of dosing errors, using information available prior to trial initiation. Materials and Methods: We constructed a dataset from ClinicalTrials.gov comprising 42,112 CTs. Structured, semi-structured trial data, and unstructured protocol-related free-text data were extracted. CTs were assigned binary labels indicating elevated dosing error rate, derived from adverse event reports, MedDRA terminology, and Wilson confidence intervals. We evaluated an XGBoost model trained on structured features, a ClinicalModernBERT model using textual data, and a simple late-fusion model combining both modalities. Post-hoc probability calibration was applied to enable interpretable, trial-level risk stratification. Results: The late-fusion model achieved the highest AUC-ROC (0.862). Beyond discrimination, calibrated outputs enabled robust stratification of CTs into predefined risk categories. The proportion of trials labeled as having an excessively high dosing error rate increased monotonically across higher predicted risk groups and aligned with the corresponding predicted probability ranges. Discussion: These findings indicate that dosing error risk can be anticipated at the trial level using pre-initiation information. Probability calibration was essential for translating model outputs into reliable and interpretable risk categories, while simple multimodal integration yielded performance gains without requiring complex architectures. Conclusion: This study introduces a reproducible and scalable ML framework for early, trial-level risk stratification of CTs at risk of high dosing error rates, supporting proactive, risk-based quality management in clinical research.

Abstract: Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is unpredictable, and its prediction in Chagas cardiomyopathy (CC) remains a significant challenge, especially in patients not classified as high risk. While AI and machine learning models improve risk stratification, their adoption is hindered by a lack of transparency, as they are often perceived as \textit{black boxes} with unclear decision-making processes. Some approaches apply heuristic explanations without correctness guarantees, leading to mistakes in the decision-making process. To address this, we apply a logic-based explainability method with correctness guarantees to the problem of SCD prediction in CC. This explainability method, applied to an AI classifier with over 95\% accuracy and recall, demonstrated strong predictive performance and 100\% explanation fidelity. When compared to state-of-the-art heuristic methods, it showed superior consistency and robustness. This approach enhances clinical trust, facilitates the integration of AI-driven tools into practice, and promotes large-scale deployment, particularly in endemic regions where it is most needed.

Abstract: While prior work has focused on projecting adversarial examples back onto the manifold of natural data to restore safety, we argue that a comprehensive understanding of AI safety requires characterizing the unsafe regions themselves. This paper introduces a framework for systematically mapping the Manifold of Failure in Large Language Models (LLMs). We reframe the search for vulnerabilities as a quality diversity problem, using MAP-Elites to illuminate the continuous topology of these failure regions, which we term behavioral attraction basins. Our quality metric, Alignment Deviation, guides the search towards areas where the model's behavior diverges most from its intended alignment. Across three LLMs: Llama-3-8B, GPT-OSS-20B, and GPT-5-Mini, we show that MAP-Elites achieves up to 63% behavioral coverage, discovers up to 370 distinct vulnerability niches, and reveals dramatically different model-specific topological signatures: Llama-3-8B exhibits a near-universal vulnerability plateau (mean Alignment Deviation 0.93), GPT-OSS-20B shows a fragmented landscape with spatially concentrated basins (mean 0.73), and GPT-5-Mini demonstrates strong robustness with a ceiling at 0.50. Our approach produces interpretable, global maps of each model's safety landscape that no existing attack method (GCG, PAIR, or TAP) can provide, shifting the paradigm from finding discrete failures to understanding their underlying structure.

Abstract: River systems operate as inherently interconnected continuous networks, meaning river hydrodynamic simulation ought to be a systemic process. However, widespread hydrology data scarcity often restricts data-driven forecasting to isolated predictions. To achieve systemic simulation and reduce reliance on river observations, we present GraphRiverCast (GRC), a topology-informed AI foundation model designed to simulate multivariate river hydrodynamics in global river systems. GRC is capable of operating in a "ColdStart" mode, generating predictions without relying on historical river states for initialization. In 7-day global pseudo-hindcasts, GRC-ColdStart functions as a robust standalone simulator, achieving a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) of approximately 0.82 without exhibiting the significant error accumulation typical of autoregressive paradigms. Ablation studies reveal that topological encoding serves as indispensable structural information in the absence of historical states, explicitly guiding hydraulic connectivity and network-scale mass redistribution to reconstruct flow dynamics. Furthermore, when adapted locally via a pre-training and fine-tuning strategy, GRC consistently outperforms physics-based and locally-trained AI baselines. Crucially, this superiority extends from gauged reaches to full river networks, underscoring the necessity of topology encoding and physics-based pre-training. Built on a physics-aligned neural operator architecture, GRC enables rapid and cross-scale adaptive simulation, establishing a collaborative paradigm bridging global hydrodynamic knowledge with local hydrological reality.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Models operating on dynamic physiologic signals must distinguish benign, label-preserving variability from true concept change. Existing concept-drift frameworks are largely distributional and provide no principled guidance on how much a model's internal representation may move when the underlying signal undergoes physiologically plausible fluctuations in energy. As a result, deep models often misinterpret harmless changes in amplitude, rate, or morphology as concept drift, yielding unstable predictions, particularly in multimodal fusion settings.
  This study introduces Physiologic Energy Conservation Theory (PECT), an energy-based framework for concept stability in dynamic signals. PECT posits that under virtual drift, normalized latent displacement should scale proportionally with normalized signal energy change, while persistent violations of this proportionality indicate real concept drift. We operationalize this principle through Energy-Constrained Representation Learning (ECRL), a lightweight regularizer that penalizes energy-inconsistent latent movement without modifying encoder architectures or adding inference-time cost.
  Although PECT is formulated for dynamic signals in general, we instantiate and evaluate it on multimodal ECG across seven unimodal and hybrid models. Experiments show that in the strongest trimodal hybrid (1D+2D+Transformer), clean accuracy is largely preserved (96.0% to 94.1%), while perturbed accuracy improves substantially (72.6% to 85.5%) and fused representation drift decreases by over 45%. Similar trends are observed across all architectures, providing empirical evidence that PECT functions as an energy-drift law governing concept stability in continuous physiologic signals.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) offers significant promise for machinery fault detection (MFD). However, most existing RL-based MFD approaches do not fully exploit RL's sequential decision-making strengths, often treating MFD as a simple guessing game (Contextual Bandits). To bridge this gap, we formulate MFD as an offline inverse reinforcement learning problem, where the agent learns the reward dynamics directly from healthy operational sequences, thereby bypassing the need for manual reward engineering and fault labels. Our framework employs Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning to train a discriminator that distinguishes between normal (expert) and policy-generated transitions. The discriminator's learned reward serves as an anomaly score, indicating deviations from normal operating behaviour. When evaluated on three run-to-failure benchmark datasets (HUMS2023, IMS, and XJTU-SY), the model consistently assigns low anomaly scores to normal samples and high scores to faulty ones, enabling early and robust fault detection. By aligning RL's sequential reasoning with MFD's temporal structure, this work opens a path toward RL-based diagnostics in data-driven industrial settings.

Conclusion: 宽平衡混合下峰度基ICA存在根本性限制，但通过源信号提纯可恢复有效对比度，为实际应用提供了理论指导和方法论

Abstract: Kurtosis-based Independent Component Analysis (ICA) weakens in wide, balanced mixtures. We prove a sharp redundancy law: for a standardized projection with effective width $R_{\mathrm{eff}}$ (participation ratio), the population excess kurtosis obeys $|κ(y)|=O(κ_{\max}/R_{\mathrm{eff}})$, yielding the order-tight $O(c_bκ_{\max}/R)$ under balance (typically $c_b=O(\log R)$). As an impossibility screen, under standard finite-moment conditions for sample kurtosis estimation, surpassing the $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ estimation scale requires $R\lesssim κ_{\max}\sqrt{T}$. We also show that \emph{purification} -- selecting $m\!\ll\!R$ sign-consistent sources -- restores $R$-independent contrast $Ω(1/m)$, with a simple data-driven heuristic. Synthetic experiments validate the predicted decay, the $\sqrt{T}$ crossover, and contrast recovery.

Abstract: Modern forward electrocardiogram (ECG) computational models rely on an accurate representation of the torso domain. The lead-field method enables fast ECG simulations while preserving full geometric fidelity. Achieving high anatomical accuracy in torso representation is, however, challenging in clinical practice, as imaging protocols are typically focused on the heart and often do not include the entire torso. In addition, the computational cost of the lead-field method scales linearly with the number of electrodes, limiting its applicability in high-density recording settings. To date, no existing approach simultaneously achieves high anatomical fidelity, low data requirements and computational efficiency. In this work, we propose a shape-informed surrogate model of the lead-field operator that serves as a drop-in replacement for the full-order model in forward ECG simulations. The proposed framework consists of two components: a geometry-encoding module that maps anatomical shapes into a low-dimensional latent space, and a geometry-conditioned neural surrogate that predicts lead-field gradients from spatial coordinates, electrode positions and latent codes. The proposed method achieves high accuracy in approximating lead fields both within the torso (mean angular error 5°) and inside the heart, resulting in highly accurate ECG simulations (relative mean squared error <2.5%. The surrogate consistently outperforms the widely used pseudo lead-field approximation while preserving negligible inference cost. Owing to its compact latent representation, the method does not require a fully detailed torso segmentation and can therefore be deployed in data-limited settings while preserving high-fidelity ECG simulations.

Abstract: Biological signals of interest in high-dimensional data are often masked by dominant variation shared across conditions. This variation, arising from baseline biological structure or technical effects, can prevent standard dimensionality reduction methods from resolving condition-specific structure. The challenge is that these confounding topics are often unknown and mixed with biological signals. Existing background correction methods are either unscalable to high dimensions or not interpretable. We introduce background contrastive Non-negative Matrix Factorization (\model), which extracts target-enriched latent topics by jointly factorizing a target dataset and a matched background using shared non-negative bases under a contrastive objective that suppresses background-expressed structure. This approach yields non-negative components that are directly interpretable at the feature level, and explicitly isolates target-specific variation. \model is learned by an efficient multiplicative update algorithm via matrix multiplication such that it is highly efficient on GPU hardware and scalable to big data via minibatch training akin to deep learning approach. Across simulations and diverse biological datasets, \model reveals signals obscured by conventional methods, including disease-associated programs in postmortem depressive brain single-cell RNA-seq, genotype-linked protein expression patterns in mice, treatment-specific transcriptional changes in leukemia, and TP53-dependent drug responses in cancer cell lines.

Motivation: 多重耐药菌的出现给临床决策带来了巨大挑战，传统药敏检测耗时且治疗方案有限。为了提高早期识别MDR的准确性并增强临床医生对机器学习预测的信任，研究旨在开发一个既准确又具有可解释性的预测框架

Method: 评估了五种分类模型，采用logistic回归、随机森林、AdaBoost、XGBoost和LightGBM。使用9714个菌株的数据集，以抗生素家族水平编码耐药性。应用LIME进行实例级解释以增强模型透明度

Result: 集成模型特别是XGBoost和LightGBM在所有评价指标上表现最佳。LIME分析显示喹诺酮类、复方新诺明、黏菌素、氨基糖苷类和呋喃类耐药是MDR预测的最强贡献因子，与已知生物学机制一致

Conclusion: 结合高性能模型和局部可解释性的框架不仅提高了MDR预测准确性，还为抗菌药物管理提供了实用见解，支持更早期的MDR识别并增强了机器学习辅助临床决策的信任度

Abstract: The rise of Antimicrobial Resistance, particularly Multi-Drug Resistance (MDR), presents a critical challenge for clinical decision-making due to limited treatment options and delays in conventional susceptibility testing. This study proposes an interpretable machine learning framework to predict MDR in bacterial isolates using clinical features and antibiotic susceptibility patterns. Five classification models were evaluated, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM. The models were trained on a curated dataset of 9,714 isolates, with resistance encoded at the antibiotic family level to capture cross-class resistance patterns consistent with MDR definitions. Performance assessment included accuracy, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and Matthews Correlation Coefficient. Ensemble models, particularly XGBoost and LightGBM, demonstrated superior predictive capability across all metrics. To address the clinical transparency gap, Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) was applied to generate instance-level explanations. LIME identified resistance to quinolones, Co-trimoxazole, Colistin, aminoglycosides, and Furanes as the strongest contributors to MDR predictions, aligning with known biological mechanisms. The results show that combining high-performing models with local interpretability provides both accuracy and actionable insights for antimicrobial stewardship. This framework supports earlier MDR identification and enhances trust in machine learning-assisted clinical decision support.

<details>

Motivation: 现有的分子性质预测模型通常只使用单一分子表示（如序列、图或3D结构），并将分子几何视为静态，这限制了模型对分子真实动态构象分布的建模能力

Method: 1.联合编码SELFIES序列（1D）、分子图（2D）和构象集合（3D）；2.使用构象集合注意力机制结合可学习注意力与玻尔兹曼加权先验；3.通过交叉注意力层实现模态间互补信息共享；4.使用FiLM模块整合实验条件信息

Conclusion: MolFM-Lite通过多模态融合和动态构象建模显著提升分子性质预测性能；预训练策略能以适度计算成本实现有效权重初始化；研究提供了完整的代码、模型和数据拆分以确保可重复性

Abstract: Most machine learning models for molecular property prediction rely on a single molecular representation (either a sequence, a graph, or a 3D structure) and treat molecular geometry as static. We present MolFM-Lite, a multi-modal model that jointly encodes SELFIES sequences (1D), molecular graphs (2D), and conformer ensembles (3D) through cross-attention fusion, while conditioning predictions on experimental context via Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). Our main methodological contributions are: (1) a conformer ensemble attention mechanism that combines learnable attention with Boltzmann-weighted priors over multiple RDKit-generated conformers, capturing the thermodynamic distribution of molecular shapes; and (2) a cross-modal fusion layer where each modality can attend to others, enabling complementary information sharing. We evaluate on four MoleculeNet scaffold-split benchmarks using our model's own splits, and report all baselines re-evaluated under the same protocol. Comprehensive ablation studies across all four datasets confirm that each architectural component contributes independently, with tri-modal fusion providing 7-11% AUC improvement over single-modality baselines and conformer ensembles adding approximately 2% over single-conformer variants. Pre-training on ZINC250K (~250K molecules) using cross-modal contrastive and masked-atom objectives enables effective weight initialization at modest compute cost. We release all code, trained models, and data splits to support reproducibility.

Abstract: Smooth-basis models such as Chebyshev polynomial regressors and radial basis function (RBF) networks are well established in numerical analysis. Their continuously differentiable prediction surfaces suit surrogate optimisation, sensitivity analysis, and other settings where the response varies gradually with inputs. Despite these properties, smooth models seldom appear in tabular regression, where tree ensembles dominate. We ask whether they can compete, benchmarking models across 55 regression datasets organised by application domain.
  We develop an anisotropic RBF network with data-driven centre placement and gradient-based width optimisation, a ridge-regularised Chebyshev polynomial regressor, and a smooth-tree hybrid (Chebyshev model tree); all three are released as scikit-learn-compatible packages. We benchmark these against tree ensembles, a pre-trained transformer, and standard baselines, evaluating accuracy alongside generalisation behaviour.
  The transformer ranks first on accuracy across a majority of datasets, but its GPU dependence, inference latency, and dataset-size limits constrain deployment in the CPU-based settings common across applied science and industry. Among CPU-viable models, smooth models and tree ensembles are statistically tied on accuracy, but the former tend to exhibit tighter generalisation gaps. We recommend routinely including smooth-basis models in the candidate pool, particularly when downstream use benefits from tighter generalisation and gradually varying predictions.

Abstract: Test-time guidance is a widely used mechanism for steering pretrained diffusion models toward outcomes specified by a reward function. Existing approaches, however, focus on maximizing reward rather than sampling from the true Bayesian posterior, leading to miscalibrated inference. In this work, we show that common test-time guidance methods do not recover the correct posterior distribution and identify the structural approximations responsible for this failure. We then propose consistent alternative estimators that enable calibrated sampling from the Bayesian posterior. We significantly outperform previous methods on a set of Bayesian inference tasks, and match state-of-the-art in black hole image reconstruction.

Abstract: Despite frequent double-blind review, systemic biases related to author demographics still disadvantage underrepresented groups. We start from a simple hypothesis: if a post-review recommender is trained with an explicit fairness regularizer, it should increase inclusion without degrading quality. To test this, we introduce Fair-PaperRec, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with a differentiable fairness loss over intersectional attributes (e.g., race, country) that re-ranks papers after double-blind review. We first probe the hypothesis on synthetic datasets spanning high, moderate, and near-fair biases. Across multiple randomized runs, these controlled studies map where increasing the fairness weight strengthens macro/micro diversity while keeping utility approximately stable, demonstrating robustness and adaptability under varying disparity levels. We then carry the hypothesis into the original setting, conference data from ACM Special Interest Group on Computer-Human Interaction (SIGCHI), Designing Interactive Systems (DIS), and Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI). In this real-world scenario, an appropriately tuned configuration of Fair-PaperRec achieves up to a 42.03% increase in underrepresented-group participation with at most a 3.16% change in overall utility relative to the historical selection. Taken together, the synthetic-to-original progression shows that fairness regularization can act as both an equity mechanism and a mild quality regularizer, especially in highly biased regimes. By first analyzing the behavior of the fairness parameters under controlled conditions and then validating them on real submissions, Fair-PaperRec offers a practical, equity-focused framework for post-review paper selection that preserves, and in some settings can even enhance, measured scholarly quality.

Abstract: Community detection in attributed networks faces a fundamental divide: topological algorithms ignore semantic features, while Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) encounter devastating computational bottlenecks. Specifically, GNNs suffer from a Semantic Wall of feature over smoothing in dense or heterophilic networks, and a Systems Wall driven by the O(N^2) memory constraints of pairwise clustering. To dismantle these barriers, we introduce ECHO (Encoding Communities via High order Operators), a scalable, self supervised architecture that reframes community detection as an adaptive, multi scale diffusion process. ECHO features a Topology Aware Router that automatically analyzes structural heuristics sparsity, density, and assortativity to route graphs through the optimal inductive bias, preventing heterophilic poisoning while ensuring semantic densification. Coupled with a memory sharded full batch contrastive objective and a novel chunked O(N \cdot K) similarity extraction method, ECHO completely bypasses traditional O(N^2) memory bottlenecks without sacrificing the mathematical precision of global gradients. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that this topology feature synergy consistently overcomes the classical resolution limit. On synthetic LFR benchmarks scaled up to 1 million nodes, ECHO achieves scale invariant accuracy despite severe topological noise. Furthermore, on massive real world social networks with over 1.6 million nodes and 30 million edges, it completes clustering in mere minutes with throughputs exceeding 2,800 nodes per second matching the speed of highly optimized purely topological baselines. The implementation utilizes a unified framework that automatically engages memory sharded optimization to support adoption across varying hardware constraints.

Abstract: Federated learning offers a privacy-friendly collaborative learning framework, yet its success, like any joint venture, hinges on the contributions of its participants. Existing client evaluation methods predominantly focus on model performance, such as accuracy or loss, which represents only one dimension of a machine learning model's overall utility. In contrast, this work investigates the critical, yet overlooked, issue of client contributions towards a model's trustworthiness -- specifically, its reliability (tolerance to noisy data), resilience (resistance to adversarial examples), and fairness (measured via demographic parity). To quantify these multifaceted contributions, we employ the state-of-the-art approximation of the Shapley value, a principled method for value attribution. Our results reveal that no single client excels across all dimensions, which are largely independent from each other, highlighting a critical flaw in current evaluation scheme: no single metric is adequate for comprehensive evaluation and equitable rewarding allocation.

Motivation: 现有语言模型在非平稳数据下的持续学习存在严重问题：在线更新会导致灾难性遗忘，而提升稳定性的方法又往往增加延迟、内存占用或计算密度，无法扩展到长上下文场景。需要从根本上解决持续学习的架构挑战。

Method: 提出TRC²解码器架构，结合稀疏丘脑路由和皮层柱结构，集成调制、预测、记忆和反馈机制。包含快速校正通路支持快速适应而不破坏慢参数稳定性。采用稀疏分块并行设计，便于高效训练和推理，同时保持各子系统的清晰可剥离性。

Conclusion: TRC²从架构层面解决了语言模型的持续学习问题，通过稀疏路由和分层机制的设计，实现了计算高效的流式适应能力，为实际部署中的持续学习需求提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Continual learning is a core requirement for deployed language models, yet standard training and fine-tuning pipelines remain brittle under non-stationary data. Online updates often induce catastrophic forgetting, while methods that improve stability frequently increase latency, memory footprint, or dense computation in ways that do not scale well to long contexts. We introduce TRC$^{2}$ (Thalamically Routed Cortical Columns), a decoder-only backbone that addresses continual learning at the architectural level. TRC$^{2}$ combines sparse thalamic routing over cortical columns with mechanisms for modulation, prediction, memory, and feedback, together with a fast corrective pathway that supports rapid adaptation without destabilizing slower parameters. The resulting block is sparse and chunk-parallel, enabling efficient training and inference while preserving clean ablations of each subsystem. We instantiate a reproducible training and evaluation stack and a continual-learning harness that measures proxy forgetting under streaming domain shifts. Across language modeling and continual learning benchmarks, TRC$^{2}$ improves the stability-plasticity tradeoff at comparable compute, enabling rapid on-stream adaptation while preserving previously acquired behavior.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) post-training has recently driven major gains in long chain-of-thought reasoning large language models (LLMs), but the high inference cost of such models motivates distillation into smaller students. Most existing knowledge distillation (KD) methods are designed for supervised fine-tuning (SFT), relying on fixed teacher traces or teacher-student Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence-based regularization. When combined with RL, these approaches often suffer from distribution mismatch and objective interference: teacher supervision may not align with the student's evolving rollout distribution, and the KL regularizer can compete with reward maximization and require careful loss balancing. To address these issues, we propose RL-aware distillation (RLAD), which performs selective imitation during RL -- guiding the student toward the teacher only when it improves the current policy update. Our core component, Trust Region Ratio Distillation (TRRD), replaces the teacher-student KL regularizer with a PPO/GRPO-style likelihood-ratio objective anchored to a teacher--old-policy mixture, yielding advantage-aware, trust-region-bounded distillation on student rollouts and naturally balancing exploration, exploitation, and imitation. Across diverse logic reasoning and math benchmarks, RLAD consistently outperforms offline distillation, standard GRPO, and KL-based on-policy teacher-student knowledge distillation.

Abstract: Pre-trained generative models for residential floor plans are typically optimized to fit large-scale data distributions, which can under-emphasize critical architectural priors such as the configurational dominance and connectivity of domestic public spaces (e.g., living rooms and foyers). This paper proposes Space Syntax-guided Post-training (SSPT), a post-training paradigm that explicitly injects space syntax knowledge into floor plan generation via a non-differentiable oracle. The oracle converts RPLAN-style layouts into rectangle-space graphs through greedy maximal-rectangle decomposition and door-mediated adjacency construction, and then computes integration-based measurements to quantify public space dominance and functional hierarchy.
  To enable consistent evaluation and diagnosis, we further introduce SSPT-Bench (Eval-8), an out-of-distribution benchmark that post-trains models using conditions capped at $\leq 7$ rooms while evaluating on 8-room programs, together with a unified metric suite for dominance, stability, and profile alignment. SSPT is instantiated with two strategies: (i) iterative retraining via space-syntax filtering and diffusion fine-tuning, and (ii) reinforcement learning via PPO with space-syntax rewards. Experiments show that both strategies improve public-space dominance and restore clearer functional hierarchy compared to distribution-fitted baselines, while PPO achieves stronger gains with substantially higher compute efficiency and reduced variance. SSPT provides a scalable pathway for integrating architectural theory into data-driven plan generation and is compatible with other generative backbones given a post-hoc evaluation oracle.

Conclusion: TEFL通过直接将基于残差的反馈嵌入学习过程，为现代深度预测系统提供了简单、通用且有效的增强方法

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in domains such as transportation, energy, and meteorology. Despite their success, modern deep forecasting models are typically trained to minimize point-wise prediction loss without leveraging the rich information contained in past prediction residuals from rolling forecasts - residuals that reflect persistent biases, unmodeled patterns, or evolving dynamics. We propose TEFL (Temporal Error Feedback Learning), a unified learning framework that explicitly incorporates these historical residuals into the forecasting pipeline during both training and evaluation. To make this practical in deep multi-step settings, we address three key challenges: (1) selecting observable multi-step residuals under the partial observability of rolling forecasts, (2) integrating them through a lightweight low-rank adapter to preserve efficiency and prevent overfitting, and (3) designing a two-stage training procedure that jointly optimizes the base forecaster and error module. Extensive experiments across 10 real-world datasets and 5 backbone architectures show that TEFL consistently improves accuracy, reducing MAE by 5-10% on average. Moreover, it demonstrates strong robustness under abrupt changes and distribution shifts, with error reductions exceeding 10% (up to 19.5%) in challenging scenarios. By embedding residual-based feedback directly into the learning process, TEFL offers a simple, general, and effective enhancement to modern deep forecasting systems.

Abstract: Serves, especially first serves, are very important in professional tennis. Servers choose their serve directions strategically to maximize their winning chances while trying to be unpredictable. On the other hand, returners try to predict serve directions to make good returns. The mind game between servers and returners is an important part of decision-making in professional tennis matches. To help understand the players' serve decisions, we have developed a machine learning method for predicting professional tennis players' first serve directions. Through feature engineering, our method achieves an average prediction accuracy of around 49\% for male players and 44\% for female players. Our analysis provides some evidence that top professional players use a mixed-strategy model in serving decisions and that fatigue might be a factor in choosing serve directions. Our analysis also suggests that contextual information is perhaps more important for returners' anticipatory reactions than previously thought.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Matrix factorization techniques, especially Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF), have been widely used for dimensionality reduction and interpretable data representation. However, existing NMF-based methods are inherently single-scale and fail to capture the evolution of connectivity structures across resolutions. In this work, we propose persistent nonnegative matrix factorization (pNMF), a scale-parameterized family of NMF problems, that produces a sequence of persistence-aligned embeddings rather than a single one. By leveraging persistent homology, we identify a canonical minimal sufficient scale set at which the underlying connectivity undergoes qualitative changes. These canonical scales induce a sequence of graph Laplacians, leading to a coupled NMF formulation with scale-wise geometric regularization and explicit cross-scale consistency constraint. We analyze the structural properties of the embeddings along the scale parameter and establish bounds on their increments between consecutive scales. The resulting model defines a nontrivial solution path across scales, rather than a single factorization, which poses new computational challenges. We develop a sequential alternating optimization algorithm with guaranteed convergence. Numerical experiments on synthetic and single-cell RNA sequencing datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in multi-scale low-rank embeddings.

Abstract: The rapid growth of scientific machine learning (SciML) has accelerated discovery across diverse domains, yet designing effective SciML models remains a challenging task. In practice, building such models often requires substantial prior knowledge and manual expertise, particularly in determining which input features to use and how large the model should be. We introduce LUMOS, an end-to-end framework based on L0-regularized learning that unifies feature selection and model pruning to democratize SciML model design. By employing semi-stochastic gating and reparameterization techniques, LUMOS dynamically selects informative features and prunes redundant parameters during training, reducing the reliance on manual tuning while maintaining predictive accuracy. We evaluate LUMOS across 13 diverse SciML workloads, including cosmology and molecular sciences, and demonstrate its effectiveness and generalizability. Experiments on 13 SciML models show that LUMOS achieves 71.45% parameter reduction and a 6.4x inference speedup on average. Furthermore, Distributed Data Parallel (DDP) training on up to eight GPUs confirms the scalability of

TL;DR: RAIN-Merging：通过零梯度方法整合指令调优模型到大型推理模型，解决格式不匹配问题，提升指令遵循同时保持推理质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型在推理链条上表现出色，但在遵循输出格式、约束等指令方面存在不足。研究者希望探索能否通过整合指令调优模型来弥补这一差距

Method: 提出RAIN-Merging方法：1）使用小型推理校准集，将指令调优模型任务向量投影到思考特殊令牌前向特征的零空间，保持推理模型的结构化推理机制；2）使用小型指令校准集，通过指令注意力估计得到模块特定缩放，放大指令相关成分并抑制泄漏

Conclusion: 通过任务向量分析和正交性识别，证明可以通过轻量级合并实现推理模型和指令调优模型的整合。RAIN-Merging能有效解决格式不匹配问题，实现指令遵循和推理能力的兼顾

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) excel at a long chain of reasoning but often fail to faithfully follow instructions regarding output format, constraints, or specific requirements. We investigate whether this gap can be closed by integrating an instruction-tuned model (ITM) into an LRM. Analyzing their differences in parameter space, namely task vectors, we find that their principal subspaces are nearly orthogonal across key modules, suggesting a lightweight merging with minimal interference. However, we also demonstrate that naive merges are fragile because they overlook the output format mismatch between LRMs (with explicit thinking and response segments) and ITMs (answers-only). We introduce RAIN-Merging (Reasoning-Aware Instruction-attention guided Null-space projection Merging), a gradient-free method that integrates instruction following while preserving thinking format and reasoning performance. First, with a small reasoning calibration set, we project the ITM task vector onto the null space of forward features at thinking special tokens, which preserves the LRM's structured reasoning mechanisms. Second, using a small instruction calibration set, we estimate instruction attention to derive module-specific scaling that amplifies instruction-relevant components and suppresses leakage. Across four instruction-following benchmarks and nine reasoning & general capability benchmarks, RAIN-Merging substantially improves instruction adherence while maintaining reasoning quality. The gains are consistent across model scales and architectures, translating to improved performance in agent settings.

Abstract: Predictive modeling over relational databases (RDBs) powers applications, yet remains challenging due to capturing both cross-table dependencies and complex feature interactions. Relational Deep Learning (RDL) methods automate feature engineering via message passing, while classical approaches like Deep Feature Synthesis (DFS) rely on predefined non-parametric aggregators. Despite performance gains, the comparative advantages of RDL over DFS and the design principles for selecting effective architectures remain poorly understood. We present a comprehensive study that unifies RDL and DFS in a shared design space and conducts architecture-centric searches across diverse RDB tasks. Our analysis yields three key findings: (1) RDL does not consistently outperform DFS, with performance being highly task-dependent; (2) no single architecture dominates across tasks, underscoring the need for task-aware model selection; and (3) validation accuracy is an unreliable guide for architecture choice. This search yields a model performance bank that links architecture configurations to their performance; leveraging this bank, we analyze the drivers of the RDL-DFS performance gap and introduce two task signals -- RDB task homophily and an affinity embedding that captures size, path, feature, and temporal structure -- whose correlation with the gap enables principled routing. Guided by these signals, we propose Relatron, a task embedding-based meta-selector that chooses between RDL and DFS and prunes the within-family search. Lightweight loss-landscape metrics further guard against brittle checkpoints by preferring flatter optima. In experiments, Relatron resolves the "more tuning, worse performance" effect and, in joint hyperparameter-architecture optimization, achieves up to 18.5% improvement over strong baselines with 10x lower cost than Fisher information-based alternatives.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant safety disparities across languages, with low-resource languages (LRLs) often bypassing safety guardrails established for high-resource languages (HRLs) like English. Existing solutions, such as multilingual supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), are computationally expensive and dependent on scarce multilingual safety data. In this work, we propose a novel, training-free alignment framework based on Sparse Weight Editing. Identifying that safety capabilities are localized within a sparse set of safety neurons, we formulate the cross-lingual alignment problem as a constrained linear transformation. We derive a closed-form solution to optimally map the harmful representations of LRLs to the robust safety subspaces of HRLs, while preserving general utility via a null-space projection constraint. Extensive experiments across 8 languages and multiple model families (Llama-3, Qwen-2.5) demonstrate that our method substantially reduces Attack Success Rate (ASR) in LRLs with negligible impact on general reasoning capabilities, all achieved with a single, data-efficient calculation.

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have become a popular medium for decoding visual information due to their cost-effectiveness and high temporal resolution. However, current approaches face significant challenges in bridging the modality gap between EEG and image data. These methods typically rely on complex adaptation processes involving multiple stages, making it hard to maintain consistency and manage compounding errors. Furthermore, the computational overhead imposed by large-scale diffusion models limit their practicality in real-world brain-computer interface (BCI) applications. In this work, we present AVDE, a lightweight and efficient framework for visual decoding from EEG signals. First, we leverage LaBraM, a pre-trained EEG model, and fine-tune it via contrastive learning to align EEG and image representations. Second, we adopt an autoregressive generative framework based on a "next-scale prediction" strategy: images are encoded into multi-scale token maps using a pre-trained VQ-VAE, and a transformer is trained to autoregressively predict finer-scale tokens starting from EEG embeddings as the coarsest representation. This design enables coherent generation while preserving a direct connection between the input EEG signals and the reconstructed images. Experiments on two datasets show that AVDE outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in both image retrieval and reconstruction tasks, while using only 10% of the parameters. In addition, visualization of intermediate outputs shows that the generative process of AVDE reflects the hierarchical nature of human visual perception. These results highlight the potential of autoregressive models as efficient and interpretable tools for practical BCI applications.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve strong performance through extended reasoning traces, but they often exhibit overthinking behavior for low-complexity queries. Existing efforts to mitigate this issue are fundamentally limited by unstable accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and poor robustness to heterogeneous reasoning behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage framework for stable adaptive thinking in LRMs. The framework first applies Hybrid Fine-Tuning to expose the model to both thinking and no-thinking behaviors, establishing well-conditioned initialization. It then performs adaptive reinforcement learning with Correctness-Preserving Advantage Shaping (CPAS) to avoid suppressing correct long-chain reasoning, and Length-Aware Gradient Regulation (LAGR) to stabilize optimization under severe reasoning-length heterogeneity. Extensive experiments on Qwen2.5-1.5B and 7B show consistent improvements over strong baselines, achieving up to +3.7/+3.6 accuracy points while reducing generated tokens by 40.6%/43.9%. Further analyses across varying problem difficulties and out-of-distribution tasks confirm the robustness and generalization of our approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个后处理、模型无关的阈值优化框架，在严格容量约束下联合平衡安全性、效率和公平性，使用统一的决策阈值以确保法规合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域部署机器学习时，需要在预测安全性和算法公平性之间取得平衡。现有公平性干预通常假设资源不受约束，并采用群体特定的决策阈值，这违反了反歧视法规。需开发在严格容量约束下同时保障安全、效率和公平且法律合规的方法。

Method: 引入后处理、模型无关的阈值优化框架，制定参数化的伦理损失函数和有限决策规则，数学上确保干预量不超过可用资源。强制使用单一的全局决策阈值以确保法律合规。

Result: 容量约束主导伦理优先级，超过80%的测试配置中，严格资源限制决定了最终部署的阈值。在25%的容量限制下，该框架成功保持了高风险识别（召回率0.409-0.702），而标准的无约束公平性启发式方法则趋近于零效用。

Conclusion: 理论上的公平性目标必须明确服从于操作容量限制才能实际部署。通过将预测评分与政策评估解耦并严格限制干预率，该框架为利益相关方在资源受限环境中应对不可避免的伦理权衡提供了实用且合法的机制。

Abstract: The deployment of machine learning in high-stakes domains requires a balance between predictive safety and algorithmic fairness. However, existing fairness interventions often as- sume unconstrained resources and employ group-specific decision thresholds that violate anti- discrimination regulations. We introduce a post-hoc, model-agnostic threshold optimization framework that jointly balances safety, efficiency, and equity under strict and hard capacity constraints. To ensure legal compliance, the framework enforces a single, global decision thresh- old. We formulated a parameterized ethical loss function coupled with a bounded decision rule that mathematically prevents intervention volumes from exceeding the available resources. An- alytically, we prove the key properties of the deployed threshold, including local monotonicity with respect to ethical weighting and the formal identification of critical capacity regimes. We conducted extensive experimental evaluations on diverse high-stakes datasets. The principal re- sults demonstrate that capacity constraints dominate ethical priorities; the strict resource limit determines the final deployed threshold in over 80% of the tested configurations. Furthermore, under a restrictive 25% capacity limit, the proposed framework successfully maintains high risk identification (recall ranging from 0.409 to 0.702), whereas standard unconstrained fairness heuristics collapse to a near-zero utility. We conclude that theoretical fairness objectives must be explicitly subordinated to operational capacity limits to remain in deployment. By decou- pling predictive scoring from policy evaluation and strictly bounding intervention rates, this framework provides a practical and legally compliant mechanism for stakeholders to navigate unavoidable ethical trade-offs in resource-constrained environments.

Abstract: Attention scales quadratically with sequence length, fundamentally limiting long-context inference. Existing block-granularity sparsification can reduce latency, but coarse blocks impose an intrinsic sparsity ceiling, making further improvements difficult even with carefully engineered designs. We present S2O, which performs early stopping for sparse attention via online permutation. Inspired by virtual-to-physical address mapping in memory systems, S2O revisits and factorizes FlashAttention execution, enabling inference to load non-contiguous tokens rather than a contiguous span in the original order. Motivated by fine-grained structures in attention heatmaps, we transform explicit permutation into an online, index-guided, discrete loading policy; with extremely lightweight preprocessing and index-remapping overhead, it concentrates importance on a small set of high-priority blocks. Building on this importance-guided online permutation for loading, S2O further introduces an early-stopping rule: computation proceeds from high to low importance; once the current block score falls below a threshold, S2O terminates early and skips the remaining low-contribution blocks, thereby increasing effective sparsity and reducing computation under a controlled error budget.
  As a result, S2O substantially raises the practical sparsity ceiling. On Llama-3.1-8B under a 128K context, S2O reduces single-operator MSE by 3.82$\times$ at matched sparsity, and reduces prefill compute density by 3.31$\times$ at matched MSE; meanwhile, it preserves end-to-end accuracy and achieves 7.51$\times$ attention and 3.81$\times$ end-to-end speedups.

Abstract: Circuit discovery has recently attracted attention as a potential research direction to explain the non-trivial behaviors of language models. It aims to find the computational subgraphs, also known as circuits, within the model that are responsible for solving specific tasks. However, most existing studies overlook the holistic nature of these circuits and require designing specific corrupted activations for different tasks, which is inaccurate and inefficient. In this work, we propose an end-to-end approach based on the principle of Information Bottleneck, called IBCircuit, to identify informative circuits holistically. IBCircuit is an optimization framework for holistic circuit discovery and can be applied to any given task without tediously corrupted activation design. In both the Indirect Object Identification (IOI) and Greater-Than tasks, IBCircuit identifies more faithful and minimal circuits in terms of critical node components and edge components compared to recent related work.

Conclusion: TabDLM通过创新的数值-语言联合扩散模型，成功解决了自由形式表格数据生成的挑战，为异构表格生成提供了统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Synthetic tabular data generation has attracted growing attention due to its importance for data augmentation, foundation models, and privacy. However, real-world tabular datasets increasingly contain free-form text fields (e.g., reviews or clinical notes) alongside structured numerical and categorical attributes. Generating such heterogeneous tables with joint modeling of different modalities remains challenging. Existing approaches broadly fall into two categories: diffusion-based methods and LLM-based methods. Diffusion models can capture complex dependencies over numerical and categorical features in continuous or discrete spaces, but extending them to open-ended text is nontrivial and often leads to degraded text quality. In contrast, LLM-based generators naturally produce fluent text, yet their discrete tokenization can distort precise or wide-range numerical values, hindering accurate modeling of both numbers and language. In this work, we propose TabDLM, a unified framework for free-form tabular data generation via a joint numerical--language diffusion model built on masked diffusion language models (MDLMs). TabDLM models textual and categorical features through masked diffusion, while modeling numerical features with a continuous diffusion process through learned specialized numeric tokens embedding; bidirectional attention then captures cross-modality interactions within a single model. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of TabDLM compared to strong diffusion- and LLM-based baselines.

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training from scratch has emerged as a promising approach for building efficient large language models (LLMs) with extremely low-bit weights (sub 2-bit), which can offer substantial advantages for edge deployment. However, existing methods still fail to achieve satisfactory accuracy and scalability. In this work, we identify a parameter democratization effect as a key bottleneck: the sensitivity of all parameters becomes homogenized, severely limiting expressivity. To address this, we propose pQuant, a method that decouples parameters by splitting linear layers into two specialized branches: a dominant 1-bit branch for efficient computation and a compact high-precision branch dedicated to preserving the most sensitive parameters. Through tailored feature scaling, we explicitly guide the model to allocate sensitive parameters to the high-precision branch. Furthermore, we extend this branch into multiple, sparsely-activated experts, enabling efficient capacity scaling. Extensive experiments indicate our pQuant achieves state-of-the-art performance in extremely low-bit quantization.

Motivation: 语言模型训练侧重于行为而非电路结构，导致多个权重配置可实现相同功能，难以区分哪些内部结构反映计算本质、哪些是特定训练的偶然产物。为揭示模型通用计算结构，作者提出提取跨训练不变的'算法核心'。

Method: 作者从不同训练轨迹中提取'算法核心'——紧凑、必要且充分的任务性能子空间。通过分析Markov-chain Transformer、模加法Transformer和GPT-2，研究其在不同任务中的不变量。采用权重子空间正交性检验、过渡谱分析、循环算子识别和语法轴翻转等技术。

Result: 1) 独立训练的Transformer学习不同权重但收敛到相同核心；2) Markov-chain Transformer将3D核心嵌入近乎正交子空间，恢复相同过渡谱；3) 模加法Transformer在'顿悟'时发现紧凑循环算子，后续膨胀，提供了从记忆到泛化转变的预测模型；4) GPT-2通过单轴控制主谓一致，翻转该轴可在生成中颠倒所有语法数的表达。

Conclusion: Transformer计算围绕紧凑、共享的算法结构组织，存在跨训练和跨尺度的低维不变量。机制可解释性应瞄准这些计算本质的不变量，而非实现细节，为理解模型内部工作提供了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit sophisticated capabilities, yet understanding how they work internally remains a central challenge. A fundamental obstacle is that training selects for behavior, not circuitry, so many weight configurations can implement the same function. Which internal structures reflect the computation, and which are accidents of a particular training run? This work extracts algorithmic cores: compact subspaces necessary and sufficient for task performance. Independently trained transformers learn different weights but converge to the same cores. Markov-chain transformers embed 3D cores in nearly orthogonal subspaces yet recover identical transition spectra. Modular-addition transformers discover compact cyclic operators at grokking that later inflate, yielding a predictive model of the memorization-to-generalization transition. GPT-2 language models govern subject-verb agreement through a single axis that, when flipped, inverts grammatical number throughout generation across scales. These results reveal low-dimensional invariants that persist across training runs and scales, suggesting that transformer computations are organized around compact, shared algorithmic structures. Mechanistic interpretability could benefit from targeting such invariants -- the computational essence -- rather than implementation-specific details.

Abstract: Fairness in Continual Learning for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) is an emerging yet underexplored challenge, particularly in the presence of imbalanced data distributions that can lead to biased model updates and suboptimal performance across tasks. While recent continual learning studies have made progress in addressing catastrophic forgetting, the problem of fairness caused the imbalanced data remains largely underexplored. This paper presents a novel Fairness Direct Preference Optimization (FaiDPO or $φ$-DPO) framework for continual learning in LMMs. In particular, we first propose a new continual learning paradigm based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to mitigate catastrophic forgetting by aligning learning with pairwise preference signals. Then, we identify the limitations of conventional DPO in imbalanced data and present a new $φ$-DPO loss that explicitly addresses distributional biases. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis demonstrating that our approach addresses both forgetting and data imbalance. Additionally, to enable $φ$-DPO-based continual learning, we construct pairwise preference annotations for existing benchmarks in the context of continual learning. Extensive experiments and ablation studies show the proposed $φ$-DPO achieves State-of-the-Art performance across multiple benchmarks, outperforming prior continual learning methods of LMMs.

Abstract: Condition injection enables diffusion models to generate context-aware outputs, which is essential for many time-series tasks. However, heterogeneous conditional contexts (e.g., observed history, missingness patterns or outlier covariates) can induce heavy-tailed per-example gradients. Under Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD), these rare conditioning-driven heavy-tailed gradients disproportionately trigger global clipping, resulting in outlier-dominated updates, larger clipping bias, and degraded utility under a fixed privacy budget. In this paper, we propose DP-aware AdaLN-Zero, a drop-in sensitivity-aware conditioning mechanism for conditional diffusion transformers that limits conditioning-induced gain without modifying the DP-SGD mechanism. DP-aware AdaLN-Zero jointly constrains conditioning representation magnitude and AdaLN modulation parameters via bounded re-parameterization, suppressing extreme gradient tail events before gradient clipping and noise injection. Empirically, DP-SGD equipped with DP-aware AdaLN-Zero improves interpolation/imputation and forecasting under matched privacy settings. We observe consistent gains on a real-world power dataset and two public ETT benchmarks over vanilla DP-SGD. Moreover, gradient diagnostics attribute these improvements to conditioning-specific tail reshaping and reduced clipping distortion, while preserving expressiveness in non-private training. Overall, these results show that sensitivity-aware conditioning can substantially improve private conditional diffusion training without sacrificing standard performance.

Abstract: In Embedding-as-an-Interface (EaaI) settings, pre-trained models are queried for Intermediate Representations (IRs). The distributional properties of IRs can leak training-set membership signals, enabling Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) whose strength varies across layers. Although Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) mitigates such leakage, existing implementations employ per-example gradient clipping and a uniform, layer-agnostic noise multiplier, ignoring heterogeneous layer-wise MIA vulnerability. This paper introduces Layer-wise MIA-risk-aware DP-SGD (LM-DP-SGD), which adaptively allocates privacy protection across layers in proportion to their MIA risk. Specifically, LM-DP-SGD trains a shadow model on a public shadow dataset, extracts per-layer IRs from its train/test splits, and fits layer-specific MIA adversaries, using their attack error rates as MIA-risk estimates. Leveraging the cross-dataset transferability of MIAs, these estimates are then used to reweight each layer's contribution to the globally clipped gradient during private training, providing layer-appropriate protection under a fixed noise magnitude. We further establish theoretical guarantees on both privacy and convergence of LM-DP-SGD. Extensive experiments show that, under the same privacy budget, LM-DP-SGD reduces the peak IR-level MIA risk while preserving utility, yielding a superior privacy-utility trade-off.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型的缩放定律仅是描述性的，无法指导最优训练方法。很少有研究能挑战这些定律所隐含的数据效率界限，这正是本文的核心关注点。

Method: 提出了测地线假说，认为token序列在平滑语义流形上沿测地线运动，因此具有局部线性特征。基于此建立了语义管道预测（STP）任务，这是一种JEPA风格的调节器，将隐藏状态轨迹限制在测地线的管状邻域内。STP将JEPA扩展到语言领域，无需显式的多视角增强，通过这种约束提升信噪比并防止推理过程中的轨迹碰撞。

Result: 在NL-RX-SYNTH数据集上，STP使LLM仅使用基线训练数据的1/16就达到了相同的准确度，直接违反了Chinchilla式缩放定律的数据项。

Conclusion: 结果表明，基于几何先验的方法可以超越暴力缩放，为提高语言模型的数据效率提供了新途径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) obey consistent scaling laws -- empirical power-law fits that predict how loss decreases with compute, data, and parameters. While predictive, these laws are descriptive rather than prescriptive: they characterize typical training, not optimal training. Surprisingly few works have successfully challenged the data-efficiency bounds implied by these laws -- which is our primary focus. To that end, we introduce the Geodesic Hypothesis, positing that token sequences trace geodesics on a smooth semantic manifold and are therefore locally linear. Building on this principle, we propose a novel Semantic Tube Prediction (STP) task, a JEPA-style regularizer that confines hidden-state trajectories to a tubular neighborhood of the geodesic. STP generalizes JEPA to language without requiring explicit multi-view augmentations. We show this constraint improves signal-to-noise ratio, and consequently preserves diversity by preventing trajectory collisions during inference. Empirically, STP allows LLMs to match baseline accuracy with 16$\times$ less training data on the NL-RX-SYNTH dataset, directly violating the data term of Chinchilla-style scaling laws and demonstrating that principled geometric priors can surpass brute-force scaling.

TL;DR: ContextRL 框架通过上下文增强提升强化学习奖励模型的可识别性和可达性，显著提升大模型知识发现效率，有效缓解奖励攻击问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对强化学习中奖励模型的两个瓶颈——可识别性（正确样本奖励函数低敏感）和可达性（部分样本组奖励稀疏），作者提出 ContextRL 框架来克服这些问题。

Method: 提供完整参考方案作为上下文，实现细粒度过程验证；引入多轮采样策略，让奖励模型针对失败尝试生成错误报告，引导策略从全负样本组中“恢复”正确响应。

Result: 在 11 个感知和推理基准测试中，ContextRL 显著提升了知识发现效率；使 Qwen3-VL-8B 模型达到与 32B 模型相当的性能，大幅超越标准 RLVR 基准，有效缓解奖励攻击。

Conclusion: 上下文信息对提升奖励模型准确性有显著潜力，奖励攻击现象广泛存在，这些发现为未来 RLVR 研究提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: We propose ContextRL, a novel framework that leverages context augmentation to overcome these bottlenecks. Specifically, to enhance Identifiability, we provide the reward model with full reference solutions as context, enabling fine-grained process verification to filter out false positives (samples with the right answer but low-quality reasoning process). To improve Reachability, we introduce a multi-turn sampling strategy where the reward model generates mistake reports for failed attempts, guiding the policy to "recover" correct responses from previously all-negative groups. Experimental results on 11 perception and reasoning benchmarks show that ContextRL significantly improves knowledge discovery efficiency. Notably, ContextRL enables the Qwen3-VL-8B model to achieve performance comparable to the 32B model, outperforming standard RLVR baselines by a large margin while effectively mitigating reward hacking. Our in-depth analysis reveals the significant potential of contextual information for improving reward model accuracy and document the widespread occurrence of reward hacking, offering valuable insights for future RLVR research.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了隐私感知的客户端选择策略，解决了差分隐私联邦学习中隐私预算不均的问题，实验表明该策略能在CIFAR-10上显著提升测试精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有差分隐私联邦学习方法假设所有客户端共享统一隐私预算，但现实应用中隐私需求存在显著差异，这种异质性导致传统基于数据量的客户端选择无法区分高质量更新和噪声较大的更新，影响了模型性能。

Method: 首先通过收敛性分析量化隐私异质性对训练误差的影响，然后提出一个隐私感知的客户端选择策略，将其构建为凸优化问题，自适应调整选择概率以最小化训练误差。

Result: 在基准数据集上进行大量实验，特别是在CIFAR-10上，该方法相比现有基线在异质隐私预算下实现了高达10%的测试精度提升。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在联邦学习中考虑隐私异质性的重要性，提出的隐私感知客户端选择策略为实际应用提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Differentially private federated learning (DP-FL) enables clients to collaboratively train machine learning models while preserving the privacy of their local data. However, most existing DP-FL approaches assume that all clients share a uniform privacy budget, an assumption that does not hold in real-world scenarios where privacy requirements vary widely. This privacy heterogeneity poses a significant challenge: conventional client selection strategies, which typically rely on data quantity, cannot distinguish between clients providing high-quality updates and those introducing substantial noise due to strict privacy constraints. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study of privacy-aware client selection in DP-FL. We establish a theoretical foundation by deriving a convergence analysis that quantifies the impact of privacy heterogeneity on training error. Building on this analysis, we propose a privacy-aware client selection strategy, formulated as a convex optimization problem, that adaptively adjusts selection probabilities to minimize training error. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves up to a 10% improvement in test accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to existing baselines under heterogeneous privacy budgets. These results highlight the importance of incorporating privacy heterogeneity into client selection for practical and effective federated learning.

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) has substantially empowered Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex reasoning tasks, yet the verbose nature of explicit reasoning steps incurs prohibitive inference latency and computational costs, limiting real-world deployment. While existing compression methods - ranging from self-training to Reinforcement Learning (RL) with length constraints - attempt to mitigate this, they often sacrifice reasoning capability for brevity. We identify a critical failure mode in these approaches: explicitly optimizing for shorter trajectories triggers rapid entropy collapse, which prematurely shrinks the exploration space and stifles the discovery of valid reasoning paths, particularly for challenging questions requiring extensive deduction. To address this issue, we propose Compress responses for Easy questions and Explore Hard ones (CEEH), a difficulty-aware approach to RL-based efficient reasoning. CEEH dynamically assesses instance difficulty to apply selective entropy regularization: it preserves a diverse search space for currently hard questions to ensure robustness, while permitting aggressive compression on easier instances where the reasoning path is well-established. In addition, we introduce a dynamic optimal-length penalty anchored to the historically shortest correct response, which effectively counteracts entropy-induced length inflation and stabilizes the reward signal. Across six reasoning benchmarks, CEEH consistently reduces response length while maintaining accuracy comparable to the base model, and improves Pass@k relative to length-only optimization.

Abstract: Universal graph pre-training has emerged as a key paradigm in graph representation learning, offering a promising way to train encoders to learn transferable representations from unlabeled graphs and to effectively generalize across a wide range of downstream tasks. However, recent explorations in universal graph pre-training primarily focus on homogeneous graphs and it remains unexplored for heterogeneous graphs, which exhibit greater structural and semantic complexity. This heterogeneity makes it highly challenging to train a universal encoder for diverse heterogeneous graphs: (i) the diverse types with dataset-specific semantics hinder the construction of a unified representation space; (ii) the number and semantics of meta-paths vary across datasets, making encoding and aggregation patterns learned from one dataset difficult to apply to others. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Meta-path-aware Universal heterogeneous Graph pre-training (MUG) approach. Specifically, for challenge (i), MUG introduces a input unification module that integrates information from multiple node and relation types within each heterogeneous graph into a unified representation.This representation is then projected into a shared space by a dimension-aware encoder, enabling alignment across graphs with diverse schemas.Furthermore, for challenge (ii), MUG trains a shared encoder to capture consistent structural patterns across diverse meta-path views rather than relying on dataset-specific aggregation strategies, while a global objective encourages discriminability and reduces dataset-specific biases. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of MUG on some real datasets.

Abstract: Recent advances in generic large models, such as GPT and DeepSeek, have motivated the introduction of universality to graph pre-training, aiming to learn rich and generalizable knowledge across diverse domains using graph representations to improve performance in various downstream applications. However, most existing methods face challenges in learning effective knowledge from generic graphs, primarily due to simplistic data alignment and limited training guidance. The issue of simplistic data alignment arises from the use of a straightforward unification for highly diverse graph data, which fails to align semantics and misleads pre-training models. The problem with limited training guidance lies in the arbitrary application of in-domain pre-training paradigms to cross-domain scenarios. While it is effective in enhancing discriminative representation in one data space, it struggles to capture effective knowledge from many graphs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Latent sEmantic Distribution Alignment (LEDA) model for universal graph pre-training. Specifically, we first introduce a dimension projection unit to adaptively align diverse domain features into a shared semantic space with minimal information loss. Furthermore, we design a variational semantic inference module to obtain the shared latent distribution. The distribution is then adopted to guide the domain projection, aligning it with shared semantics across domains and ensuring cross-domain semantic learning. LEDA exhibits strong performance across a broad range of graphs and downstream tasks. Remarkably, in few-shot cross-domain settings, it significantly outperforms in-domain baselines and advanced universal pre-training models.

Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing global crisis projected to cause 10 million deaths per year by 2050. While the WHO Global Antimicrobial Resistance and Use Surveillance System (GLASS) provides standardized surveillance data across 44 countries, few studies have applied machine learning to forecast population-level resistance trends from this data. This paper presents a two-component framework for AMR trend forecasting and evidence-grounded policy decision support. We benchmark six models -- Naive, Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, and LSTM -- on 5,909 WHO GLASS observations across six WHO regions (2021-2023). XGBoost achieved the best performance with a test MAE of 7.07% and R-squared of 0.854, outperforming the naive baseline by 83.1%. Feature importance analysis identified the prior-year resistance rate as the dominant predictor (50.5% importance), while regional MAE ranged from 4.16% (European Region) to 10.14% (South-East Asia Region). We additionally implemented a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline combining a ChromaDB vector store of WHO policy documents with a locally deployed Phi-3 Mini language model, producing source-attributed, hallucination-constrained policy answers.

TL;DR: 作者提出了LITE方法，通过更大的Hessian阻尼系数和学习率在平坦方向上加速Muon和SOAP等矩阵优化器，显著提升LLM预训练效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大规模语言模型预训练需要巨大计算资源，优化器效率至关重要。现有的矩阵优化器(如Muon、SOAP)虽然利用细粒度曲率信息优于AdamW，但其更新趋于各向同性——在平坦方向上相对保守，在陡峭方向上可能过于激进，无法充分利用各向异性优化地貌的特性

Method: 首先建立统一的黎曼常微分方程框架，揭示自适应算法的协同工作原理：预条件器诱导黎曼几何缓解病态条件，动量作为黎曼阻尼项促进收敛。基于此提出LITE加速策略，通过在平坦轨迹上应用更大的Hessian阻尼系数和学习率来增强训练动力学

Result: 大量实验表明，LITE显著加速了Muon和SOAP在多种架构(密集、MoE)、参数规模(130M-1.3B)、数据集(C4、Pile)和学习率调度下的训练；理论分析确认LITE在各向异性地貌中能沿平坦方向实现更快收敛

Conclusion: LITE为LLM预训练提供了一个有原则的高效方法，通过针对性处理平坦方向的优化动态，实现了对现有矩阵优化器的实质性加速，代码已开源

Abstract: Pre-training Large Language Models requires immense computational resources, making optimizer efficiency essential. The optimization landscape is highly anisotropic, with loss reduction driven predominantly by progress along flat directions. While matrix-based optimizers such as Muon and SOAP leverage fine-grained curvature information to outperform AdamW, their updates tend toward isotropy -- relatively conservative along flat directions yet potentially aggressive along sharp ones. To address this limitation, we first establish a unified Riemannian Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) framework that elucidates how common adaptive algorithms operate synergistically: the preconditioner induces a Riemannian geometry that mitigates ill-conditioning, while momentum serves as a Riemannian damping term that promotes convergence. Guided by these insights, we propose LITE, a generalized acceleration strategy that enhances training dynamics by applying larger Hessian damping coefficients and learning rates along flat trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LITE significantly accelerates both Muon and SOAP across diverse architectures (Dense, MoE), parameter scales (130M--1.3B), datasets (C4, Pile), and learning-rate schedules (cosine, warmup-stable-decay). Theoretical analysis confirms that LITE facilitates faster convergence along flat directions in anisotropic landscapes, providing a principled approach to efficient LLM pre-training.

Conclusion: GeoDPO在几何感知和推理任务上表现出卓越性能和泛化能力，显著优于监督微调方法，为增强VLMs的几何理解提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle with geometric reasoning due to their limited perception of fundamental diagram elements. To tackle this challenge, we introduce GeoPerceive, a benchmark comprising diagram instances paired with domain-specific language (DSL) representations, along with an efficient automatic data generation pipeline. This design enables the isolated evaluation of geometric perception independently from reasoning. To exploit the data provided by GeoPerceive for enhancing the geometric perception capabilities of VLMs, we propose GeoDPO, a translator-guided reinforcement learning (RL) framework. GeoDPO employs an NL-to-DSL translator, which is trained on synthetic pairs generated by the data engine of GeoPerceive, to bridge natural language and DSL. This translator facilitates the computation of fine-grained, DSL-level scores, which serve as reward signals in reinforcement learning. We assess GeoDPO on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, spanning tasks in geometric perception as well as downstream reasoning. Experimental results demonstrate that, while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) offers only marginal improvements and may even impair performance in out-of-domain scenarios, GeoDPO achieves substantial gains: $+26.5\%$ on in-domain data, $+8.0\%$ on out-of-domain data, and $+39.0\%$ on downstream reasoning tasks. These findings underscore the superior performance and generalization ability of GeoDPO over SFT. All codes are released at https://github.com/Longin-Yu/GeoPerceive

Abstract: Epistemic uncertainty in neural networks is commonly modeled using two second-order paradigms: distribution-based representations, which rely on posterior parameter distributions, and set-based representations based on credal sets (convex sets of probability distributions). These frameworks are often regarded as fundamentally non-comparable due to differing semantics, assumptions, and evaluation practices, leaving their relative merits unclear. Empirical comparisons are further confounded by variations in the underlying predictive models. To clarify this issue, we present a controlled comparative study enabling principled, like-for-like evaluation of the two paradigms. Both representations are constructed from the same finite collection of predictive distributions generated by a shared neural network, isolating representational effects from predictive accuracy. Our study evaluates each representation through the lens of 3 uncertainty measures across 8 benchmarks, including selective prediction and out-of-distribution detection, spanning 6 underlying predictive models and 10 independent runs per configuration. Our results show that meaningful comparison between these seemingly non-comparable frameworks is both feasible and informative, providing insights into how second-order representation choices impact practical uncertainty-aware performance.

Abstract: In this work, we present the first theoretical analysis of multi-agent imitation learning (MAIL) in linear Markov games where both the transition dynamics and each agent's reward function are linear in some given features. We demonstrate that by leveraging this structure, it is possible to replace the state-action level "all policy deviation concentrability coefficient" (Freihaut et al., arXiv:2510.09325) with a concentrability coefficient defined at the feature level which can be much smaller than the state-action analog when the features are informative about states' similarity. Furthermore, to circumvent the need for any concentrability coefficient, we turn to the interactive setting. We provide the first, computationally efficient, interactive MAIL algorithm for linear Markov games and show that its sample complexity depends only on the dimension of the feature map $d$. Building on these theoretical findings, we propose a deep MAIL interactive algorithm which clearly outperforms BC on games such as Tic-Tac-Toe and Connect4.

Conclusion: 提出的分布式提示缓存方法能显著提升边缘设备上本地LLM推理性能，通过状态共享和通信优化有效解决了资源受限环境下的性能瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Since local LLM inference on resource-constrained edge devices imposes a severe performance bottleneck, this paper proposes distributed prompt caching to enhance inference performance by cooperatively sharing intermediate processing states across multiple low-end edge devices. To fully utilize prompt similarity, our distributed caching mechanism also supports partial matching. As this approach introduces communication overhead associated with state sharing over a wireless network, we introduce a Bloom-filter-based data structure, referred to as a catalog, to determine whether a remote server possesses the desired internal states, thereby suppressing unnecessary communication. Experiments using the Gemma-3 270M model and the MMLU dataset on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W platform demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces TTFT (Time to First Token) and TTLT (Time to Last Token) by 93.12% and 50.07% on average, respectively.

Abstract: Group-based reinforcement learning (RL), such as GRPO, has advanced the capabilities of large language models on long-horizon agentic tasks. To enable more fine-grained policy updates, recent research has increasingly shifted toward stepwise group-based policy optimization, which treats each step in a rollout trajectory independently while using a memory module to retain historical context. However, we find a key issue in estimating stepwise relative advantages, namely context inconsistency, where steps within the same group may differ in their historical contexts. Empirically, we reveal that this issue can lead to severely biased advantage estimation, thereby degrading policy optimization significantly. To address the issue, in this paper, we propose Hierarchy-of-Groups Policy Optimization (HGPO) for long-horizon agentic tasks. Specifically, within a group of rollout trajectories, HGPO assigns each step to multiple hierarchical groups according to the consistency of historical contexts. Then, for each step, HGPO computes distinct advantages within each group and aggregates them with an adaptive weighting scheme. In this way, HGPO can achieve a favorable bias-variance trade-off in stepwise advantage estimation, without extra models or rollouts. Evaluations on two challenging agentic tasks, ALFWorld and WebShop with Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct and Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, show that HGPO significantly outperforms existing agentic RL methods under the same computational constraints.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Functional data clustering is concerned with grouping functions that share similar structure, yet most existing methods implicitly operate on sampled grids, causing cluster assignments to depend on resolution, sampling density, or preprocessing choices rather than on the underlying functions themselves. To address this limitation, we introduce a framework that maps discretized function observations -- at arbitrary resolution and on arbitrary grids -- into a fixed-dimensional vector space via an auto-encoding architecture. The encoder is a hypernetwork that maps coordinate-value pairs to the weight space of an implicit neural representation (INR), which serves as the decoder. Because INRs represent functions with very few parameters, this design yields compact representations that are decoupled from the sampling grid, while the hypernetwork amortizes weight prediction across the dataset. Clustering is then performed in this weight space using standard algorithms, making the approach agnostic to both the discretization and the choice of clustering method. By means of synthetic and real-world experiments in high-dimensional settings, we demonstrate competitive clustering performance that is robust to changes in sampling resolution -- including generalization to resolutions not seen during training.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的道德基准测试通常使用无情境提示，隐含假设模型偏好是稳定的。但在实际部署中，提示通常包含用户请求、社会规范线索等情境信号，这些可能会影响模型的道德决策。研究旨在探索定向情境影响如何重塑LLMs在道德权衡场景中的决定。

Method: 研究引入了一个针对电车问题式道德权衡场景的定向情境影响评估框架。对每个人口统计因素，应用匹配的、方向相反的情境影响（仅在偏袒哪个群体上不同），从而系统测量模型的定向响应。

Result: 研究发现：（1）情境影响常显著改变决策，即使只是表面相关；（2）基线偏好不能很好预测定向可操控性，模型可能表面中立但在影响下表现出系统性的操控不对称性；（3）影响可能适得其反：模型可能声称中立或忽视情境线索，但选择仍然改变，有时甚至反向改变；（4）推理会降低平均敏感性，但会放大有偏少样本示例的影响。

Abstract: Moral benchmarks for LLMs typically use context-free prompts, implicitly assuming stable preferences. In deployment, however, prompts routinely include contextual signals such as user requests, cues on social norms, etc. that may steer decisions. We study how directed contextual influences reshape decisions in trolley-problem-style moral triage settings. We introduce a pilot evaluation harness for directed contextual influence in trolley-problem-style moral triage: for each demographic factor, we apply matched, direction-flipped contextual influences that differ only in which group they favor, enabling systematic measurement of directional response. We find that: (i) contextual influences often significantly shift decisions, even when only superficially relevant; (ii) baseline preferences are a poor predictor of directional steerability, as models can appear baseline-neutral yet exhibit systematic steerability asymmetry under influence; (iii) influences can backfire: models may explicitly claim neutrality or discount the contextual cue, yet their choices still shift, sometimes in the opposite direction; and (iv) reasoning reduces average sensitivity, but amplifies the effect of biased few-shot examples. Our findings motivate extending moral evaluations with controlled, direction-flipped context manipulations to better characterize model behavior.

Abstract: The concept of ranking aggregation plays a central role in preference analysis, and numerous algorithms for calculating median rankings, often originating in social choice theory, have been documented in the literature, offering theoretical guarantees in a centralized setting, i.e., when all the ranking data to be aggregated can be brought together in a single computing unit. For many technologies (e.g. peer-to-peer networks, IoT, multi-agent systems), extending the ability to calculate consensus rankings with guarantees in a decentralized setting, i.e., when preference data is initially distributed across a communicating network, remains a major methodological challenge. Indeed, in recent years, the literature on decentralized computation has mainly focused on computing or optimizing statistics such as arithmetic means using gossip algorithms. The purpose of this article is precisely to study how to achieve reliable consensus on collective rankings using classical rules (e.g. Borda, Copeland) in a decentralized setting, thereby raising new questions, robustness to corrupted nodes, and scalability through reduced communication costs in particular. The approach proposed and analyzed here relies on random gossip communication, allowing autonomous agents to compute global ranking consensus using only local interactions, without coordination or central authority.
  We provide rigorous convergence guarantees, including explicit rate bounds, for the Borda and Copeland consensus methods. Beyond these rules, we also provide a decentralized implementation of consensus according to the median rank rule and local Kemenization. Extensive empirical evaluations on various network topologies and real and synthetic ranking datasets demonstrate that our algorithms converge quickly and reliably to the correct ranking aggregation.

Abstract: Accurate computational identification of DNA methylation is essential for understanding epigenetic regulation. Although deep learning excels in this binary classification task, its "black-box" nature impedes biological insight. We address this by introducing a high-performance model MEDNA-DFM, alongside mechanism-inspired signal purification algorithms. Our investigation demonstrates that MEDNA-DFM effectively captures conserved methylation patterns, achieving robust distinction across diverse species. Validation on external independent datasets confirms that the model's generalization is driven by conserved intrinsic motifs (e.g., GC content) rather than phylogenetic proximity. Furthermore, applying our developed algorithms extracted motifs with significantly higher reliability than prior studies. Finally, empirical evidence from a Drosophila 6mA case study prompted us to propose a "sequence-structure synergy" hypothesis, suggesting that the GAGG core motif and an upstream A-tract element function cooperatively. We further validated this hypothesis via in silico mutagenesis, confirming that the ablation of either or both elements significantly degrades the model's recognition capabilities. This work provides a powerful tool for methylation prediction and demonstrates how explainable deep learning can drive both methodological innovation and the generation of biological hypotheses.

Abstract: In this article, we provide an axiomatic characterization of feature attribution for multi-output predictors within the Shapley framework. While SHAP explanations are routinely computed independently for each output coordinate, the theoretical necessity of this practice has remained unclear. By extending the classical Shapley axioms to vector-valued cooperative games, we establish a rigidity theorem showing that any attribution rule satisfying efficiency, symmetry, dummy player, and additivity must necessarily decompose component-wise across outputs. Consequently, any joint-output attribution rule must relax at least one of the classical Shapley axioms. This result identifies a previously unformalized structural constraint in Shapley-based interpretability, clarifying the precise scope of fairness-consistent explanations in multi-output learning. Numerical experiments on a biomedical benchmark illustrate that multi-output models can yield computational savings in training and deployment, while producing SHAP explanations that remain fully consistent with the component-wise structure imposed by the Shapley axioms.

TL;DR: NoRA (Non-linear Rank Adaptation) 通过引入 SiLU 门控和结构化 dropout 打破 LoRA 在线性天花板上的限制，在复杂推理任务中实现更高的谱效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA 在参数高效微调中占主导地位，但面临复杂推理任务中的线性天花板问题。单纯的增加秩数由于内在线性限制会导致收益递减，需要突破这一局限。

Method: NoRA 提出了一种权重级别的并行适配器，通过注入 SiLU 门控和结构化 dropout 来诱导流形扩展，避免线性方法的秩坍塌问题。

Result: 在 SlimOrca 基准测试中，NoRA 在秩 64 时 (PPL 3.89) 显著优于 LoRA 在秩 512 时的表现 (PPL 3.90)。在数学推理任务中，NoRA 在 MathInstruct 上获得困惑度 1.97，远优于 LoRA 的饱和点 2.07。奇异值分解分析确认 NoRA 能够激活奇异值谱的休眠尾端。

Conclusion: NoRA 成功打破了 LoRA 的线性天花板限制，通过非线性结构显著提升参数效率，为复杂推理任务的参数高效微调提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) dominates parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). However, it faces a critical ``linear ceiling'' in complex reasoning tasks: simply increasing the rank yields diminishing returns due to intrinsic linear constraints. We introduce NoRA (Non-linear Rank Adaptation), a weight-level parallel adapter that injects SiLU gating and structural dropout to induce manifold expansion. On the SlimOrca benchmark, NoRA breaks this linear barrier: NoRA remarkably at rank 64 (PPL 3.89) outperforms LoRA at rank 512 (PPL 3.90), demonstrating superior spectral efficiency. This advantage generalizes to mathematical reasoning, where NoRA achieves a perplexity of 1.97 on MathInstruct, significantly surpassing LoRA's saturation point of 2.07. Mechanism analysis via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) confirms that NoRA activates the dormant tail of the singular value spectrum, effectively preventing the rank collapse observed in linear methods.

Abstract: Algorithmic stability is among the most potent techniques in generalization analysis. However, its derivation usually requires a stepsize $η_t = \mathcal{O}(1/t)$ under non-convex training regimes, where $t$ denotes iterations. This rigid decay of the stepsize potentially impedes optimization and may not align with practical scenarios. In this paper, we derive the generalization bounds under the homogeneous neural network regimes, proving that this regime enables slower stepsize decay of order $Ω(1/\sqrt{t})$ under mild assumptions. We further extend the theoretical results from several aspects, e.g., non-Lipschitz regimes. This finding is broadly applicable, as homogeneous neural networks encompass fully-connected and convolutional neural networks with ReLU and LeakyReLU activations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据驱动模型正在革新天气预测领域，但如何优化训练效率和提高模型性能尚未有系统研究。本文旨在通过分析该领域的实证缩放定律，指导资源分配决策。

Method: 分析模型性能（验证损失）与模型规模（N）、数据集规模（D）和计算预算（C）之间的关系。研究了多种天气预测模型，包括Aurora和GraphCast，进行了计算最优分析并考察模型形状对缩放行为的影响。

Result: Aurora表现最强的数据缩放行为，数据集增加10倍可使验证损失降低达3.2倍；GraphCast参数效率最高但硬件利用率有限；在固定计算预算下，分配资源给更长时间训练比增加模型规模带来更大性能提升；天气预测模型始终偏好增加宽度而非深度，这与语言模型的缩放行为本质不同。

Conclusion: 未来天气模型应优先考虑更宽的架构和更大的有效训练数据集来最大化预测性能。数据缩放和参数效率是需要平衡的两个重要方面，天气预测领域的缩放定律与语言模型领域存在根本差异。

Abstract: Data-driven models are revolutionizing weather forecasting. To optimize training efficiency and model performance, this paper analyzes empirical scaling laws within this domain. We investigate the relationship between model performance (validation loss) and three key factors: model size ($N$), dataset size ($D$), and compute budget ($C$). Across a range of models, we find that Aurora exhibits the strongest data-scaling behavior: increasing the training dataset by 10x reduces validation loss by up to 3.2x. GraphCast demonstrates the highest parameter efficiency, yet suffers from limited hardware utilization. Our compute-optimal analysis indicates that, under fixed compute budgets, allocating resources to longer training durations yields greater performance gains than increasing model size. Furthermore, we analyze model shape and uncover scaling behaviors that differ fundamentally from those observed in language models: weather forecasting models consistently favor increased width over depth. These findings suggest that future weather models should prioritize wider architectures and larger effective training datasets to maximize predictive performance.

Abstract: Exploration remains the key bottleneck for large language model agents trained with reinforcement learning. While prior methods exploit pretrained knowledge, they fail in environments requiring the discovery of novel states. We propose Exploratory Memory-Augmented On- and Off-Policy Optimization (EMPO$^2$), a hybrid RL framework that leverages memory for exploration and combines on- and off-policy updates to make LLMs perform well with memory while also ensuring robustness without it. On ScienceWorld and WebShop, EMPO$^2$ achieves 128.6% and 11.3% improvements over GRPO, respectively. Moreover, in out-of-distribution tests, EMPO$^2$ demonstrates superior adaptability to new tasks, requiring only a few trials with memory and no parameter updates. These results highlight EMPO$^2$ as a promising framework for building more exploratory and generalizable LLM-based agents.

Abstract: Cardiac blood flow patterns contain rich information about disease severity and clinical interventions, yet current imaging and computational methods fail to capture underlying relational structures of coherent flow features. We propose a physics-informed, latent relational framework to model cardiac vortices as interacting nodes in a graph. Our model combines a neural relational inference architecture with physics-inspired interaction energy and birth-death dynamics, yielding a latent graph sensitive to disease severity and intervention level. We first apply this to computational fluid dynamics simulations of aortic coarctation. Learned latent graphs reveal that as the aortic radius narrows, vortex interactions become stronger and more frequent. This leads to a higher graph entropy, correlating monotonically with coarctation severity ($R^2=0.78$, Spearman $|ρ|=0.96$). We then extend this method to ultrasound datasets of left ventricles under varying levels of left ventricular assist device support. Again the latent graph representation captures the weakening of coherent vortical structures, thereby demonstrating cross-modal generalisation. Results show latent interaction graphs and entropy serve as robust and interpretable markers of cardiac disease and intervention.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is crucial for diagnosing heart disease, but most self-supervised learning methods treat ECG as a generic time series, overlooking physiologic semantics and rhythm-level structure. Existing contrastive methods utilize augmentations that distort morphology, whereas generative approaches employ fixed-window segmentation, which misaligns cardiac cycles. To address these limitations, we propose RhythmBERT, a generative ECG language model that considers ECG as a language paradigm by encoding P, QRS, and T segments into symbolic tokens via autoencoder-based latent representations. These discrete tokens capture rhythm semantics, while complementary continuous embeddings retain fine-grained morphology, enabling a unified view of waveform structure and rhythm. RhythmBERT is pretrained on approximately 800,000 unlabeled ECG recordings with a masked prediction objective, allowing it to learn contextual representations in a label-efficient manner. Evaluations show that despite using only a single lead, RhythmBERT achieves comparable or superior performance to strong 12-lead baselines. This generalization extends from prevalent conditions such as atrial fibrillation to clinically challenging cases such as subtle ST-T abnormalities and myocardial infarction. Our results suggest that considering ECG as structured language offers a scalable and physiologically aligned pathway for advancing cardiac analysis.

Motivation: 大型批量LLM训练中，激活内存成为主要瓶颈。现有压缩方法未能充分利用激活的谱结构，导致收敛缓慢或压缩有限。为了解决这一问题，研究探索压缩算法的快速收敛机制与子空间投影要求之间的关系。

Method: PRAC创新性地将激活分解为两个部分：通过SVD捕获的主成分子空间以保留主要信息，以及从正交补空间采样的随机子空间以近似尾部信息。通过引入精确的缩放因子，证明了PRAC能在特定条件下产生具有最小方差的无偏梯度估计器。

Result: 在预训练和微调任务上的大量实验表明，PRAC能在最小计算成本的情况下，实现高达36%的总内存减少，且性能下降可忽略不计。

Conclusion: PRAC通过有效利用激活的谱结构，解决了LLM训练中的内存瓶颈问题，提供了一种高效且可靠的激活压缩解决方案，对大规模模型训练具有重要意义。

Abstract: Activations have become the primary memory bottleneck in large-batch LLM training. However, existing compression methods fail to exploit the spectral structure of activations, resulting in slow convergence or limited compression. To address this, we bridge the relationship between the algorithm's fast convergence and the requirements for subspace projection, and show that an effective compression should yield an unbiased estimate of the original activation with low variance. We propose Principal-Random Subspace for LLM Activation Compression (PRAC), which novelly decomposes activations into two components: a principal subspace captured via SVD to retain dominant information, and a random subspace sampled from the orthogonal complement to approximate the tail. By introducing a precise scaling factor, we prove that PRAC yields an unbiased gradient estimator with minimum variance under certain conditions. Extensive experiments on pre-training and fine-tuning tasks demonstrate that PRAC achieves up to 36% total memory reduction with negligible performance degradation and minimal computational cost.

Abstract: We consider the problem of contextual online RLHF with general preferences, where the goal is to identify the Nash Equilibrium. We adopt the Generalized Bilinear Preference Model (GBPM) to capture potentially intransitive preferences via low-rank, skew-symmetric matrices. We investigate general preference learning with any strongly convex regularizer (where $η^{-1}$ is the regularization strength), generalizing beyond prior works limited to reverse KL-regularization. Central to our analysis is proving that the dual gap of the greedy policy is bounded by the square of the estimation error - a result derived solely from strong convexity and the skew-symmetricity of GBPM.Building on this insight and a feature diversity assumption, we establish two regret bounds via two simple algorithms: (1) Greedy Sampling achieves polylogarithmic, $e^{O(η)}$-free regret $\tilde{O}(ηd^4 (\log T)^2)$. (2) Explore-Then-Commit achieves $\mathrm{poly}(d)$-free regret $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{ηr T})$ by exploiting the low-rank structure; this is the first statistically efficient guarantee for online RLHF in high-dimensions.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Real-world dynamic graphs are often directed, with source and destination nodes exhibiting asymmetrical behavioral patterns and temporal dynamics. However, existing dynamic graph architectures largely rely on shared parameters for processing source and destination nodes, with limited or no systematic role-aware modeling. We propose DyGnROLE (Dynamic Graph Node-Role-Oriented Latent Encoding), a transformer-based architecture that explicitly disentangles source and destination representations. By using separate embedding vocabularies and role-semantic positional encodings, the model captures the distinct structural and temporal contexts unique to each role. Critical to the effectiveness of these specialized embeddings in low-label regimes is a self-supervised pretraining objective we introduce: Temporal Contrastive Link Prediction (TCLP). The pretraining uses the full unlabeled interaction history to encode informative structural biases, enabling the model to learn role-specific representations without requiring annotated data. Evaluation on future edge classification demonstrates that DyGnROLE substantially outperforms a diverse set of state-of-the-art baselines, establishing role-aware modeling as an effective strategy for dynamic graph learning.

Abstract: Predicting diffusion coefficients in mixtures is crucial for many applications, as experimental data remain scarce, and machine learning (ML) offers promising alternatives to established semi-empirical models. Among ML models, matrix completion methods (MCMs) have proven effective in predicting thermophysical properties, including diffusion coefficients in binary mixtures. However, MCMs are restricted to single-temperature predictions, and their accuracy depends strongly on the availability of high-quality experimental data for each temperature of interest. In this work, we address this challenge by presenting a hybrid tensor completion method (TCM) for predicting temperature-dependent diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution in binary mixtures. The TCM employs a Tucker decomposition and is jointly trained on experimental data for diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution in binary systems at 298 K, 313 K, and 333 K. Predictions from the semi-empirical SEGWE model serve as prior knowledge within a Bayesian training framework. The TCM then extrapolates linearly to any temperature between 268 K and 378 K, achieving markedly improved prediction accuracy compared to established models across all studied temperatures. To further enhance predictive performance, the experimental database was expanded using active learning (AL) strategies for targeted acquisition of new diffusion data by pulsed-field gradient (PFG) NMR measurements. Diffusion coefficients at infinite dilution in 19 solute + solvent systems were measured at 298 K, 313 K, and 333 K. Incorporating these results yields a substantial improvement in the TCM's predictive accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of combining data-efficient ML methods with adaptive experimentation to advance predictive modeling of transport properties.

Abstract: Near-surface atmospheric conditions can differ sharply over tens to hundreds of meters due to land cover and topography, yet this variability is absent from current weather analyses and forecasts. It is unclear whether such meter-scale variability reflects irreducibly chaotic dynamics or contains a component predictable from surface characteristics and large-scale atmospheric forcing. Here we show that a substantial, physically coherent component of meter-scale near-surface weather is statistically recoverable from existing observations. By conditioning coarse atmospheric state on sparse surface station measurements and high-resolution Earth observation data, we infer spatially continuous fields of near-surface wind, temperature, and humidity at 10 m resolution across the contiguous United States. Relative to ERA5, the inferred fields reduce wind error by 29% and temperature and dewpoint error by 6%, while explaining substantially more spatial variance at fixed time steps. They also exhibit physically interpretable structure, including urban heat islands, evapotranspiration-driven humidity contrasts, and wind speed differences across land cover types. Our findings expand the frontier of weather modeling by demonstrating a computationally feasible approach to continental-scale meter-resolution inference. More broadly, they illustrate how conditioning coarse dynamical models on static fine-scale features can reveal previously unresolved components of the Earth system.

Abstract: Temporal Web analytics increasingly relies on large-scale, longitudinal data to understand how users, content, and systems evolve over time. A rapidly growing frontier is the \emph{Temporal Web3}: decentralized platforms whose behavior is recorded as immutable, time-stamped event streams. Despite the richness of this data, the field lacks shared, reproducible benchmarks that capture real-world temporal dynamics, specifically censoring and non-stationarity, across extended horizons. This absence slows methodological progress and limits the transfer of techniques between Web3 and broader Web domains. In this paper, we present the \textit{FinSurvival Challenge 2025} as a case study in benchmarking \emph{temporal Web3 intelligence}. Using 21.8 million transaction records from the Aave v3 protocol, the challenge operationalized 16 survival prediction tasks to model user behavior transitions.We detail the benchmark design and the winning solutions, highlighting how domain-aware temporal feature construction significantly outperformed generic modeling approaches. Furthermore, we distill lessons for next-generation temporal benchmarks, arguing that Web3 systems provide a high-fidelity sandbox for studying temporal challenges, such as churn, risk, and evolution that are fundamental to the wider Web.

Abstract: Protein sequences are abundant in repeating segments, both as exact copies and as approximate segments with mutations. These repeats are important for protein structure and function, motivating decades of algorithmic work on repeat identification. Recent work has shown that protein language models (PLMs) identify repeats, by examining their behavior in masked-token prediction. To elucidate their internal mechanisms, we investigate how PLMs detect both exact and approximate repeats. We find that the mechanism for approximate repeats functionally subsumes that of exact repeats. We then characterize this mechanism, revealing two main stages: PLMs first build feature representations using both general positional attention heads and biologically specialized components, such as neurons that encode amino-acid similarity. Then, induction heads attend to aligned tokens across repeated segments, promoting the correct answer. Our results reveal how PLMs solve this biological task by combining language-based pattern matching with specialized biological knowledge, thereby establishing a basis for studying more complex evolutionary processes in PLMs.

Result: 该方法支持医疗健康和客户服务等场景，这些场景需要比固定目标记忆更新更灵活的适应机制。

Conclusion: 基于自然语言指令的神经记忆系统为解决非平稳环境中的选择性学习和适应性更新提供了有效框架。

Abstract: Modern machine learning models are deployed in diverse, non-stationary environments where they must continually adapt to new tasks and evolving knowledge. Continual fine-tuning and in-context learning are costly and brittle, whereas neural memory methods promise lightweight updates with minimal forgetting. However, existing neural memory models typically assume a single fixed objective and homogeneous information streams, leaving users with no control over what the model remembers or ignores over time. To address this challenge, we propose a generalized neural memory system that performs flexible updates based on learning instructions specified in natural language. Our approach enables adaptive agents to learn selectively from heterogeneous information sources, supporting settings, such as healthcare and customer service, where fixed-objective memory updates are insufficient.

Conclusion: 基于HJB方程的物理信息正则化为离线GCRL提供了理论坚实且数值稳定的框架，显著改善了复杂环境下的值函数学习性能

Abstract: Offline goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (GCRL) learns goal-conditioned policies from static pre-collected datasets. However, accurate value estimation remains a challenge due to the limited coverage of the state-action space. Recent physics-informed approaches have sought to address this by imposing physical and geometric constraints on the value function through regularization defined over first-order partial differential equations (PDEs), such as the Eikonal equation. However, these formulations can often be ill-posed in complex, high-dimensional environments. In this work, we propose a physics-informed regularization derived from the viscosity solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. By providing a physics-based inductive bias, our approach grounds the learning process in optimal control theory, explicitly regularizing and bounding updates during value iterations. Furthermore, we leverage the Feynman-Kac theorem to recast the PDE solution as an expectation, enabling a tractable Monte Carlo estimation of the objective that avoids numerical instability in higher-order gradients. Experiments demonstrate that our method improves geometric consistency, making it broadly applicable to navigation and high-dimensional, complex manipulation tasks.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) faces challenges in uncertainty quantification (UQ). Without reliable UQ, FL systems risk deploying overconfident models at under-resourced agents, leading to silent local failures despite seemingly satisfactory global performance. Existing federated UQ approaches often address data heterogeneity or model heterogeneity in isolation, overlooking their joint effect on coverage reliability across agents. Conformal prediction is a widely used distribution-free UQ framework, yet its applications in heterogeneous FL settings remains underexplored. We provide FedWQ-CP, a simple yet effective approach that balances empirical coverage performance with efficiency at both global and agent levels under the dual heterogeneity. FedWQ-CP performs agent-server calibration in a single communication round. On each agent, conformity scores are computed on calibration data and a local quantile threshold is derived. Each agent then transmits only its quantile threshold and calibration sample size to the server. The server simply aggregates these thresholds through a weighted average to produce a global threshold. Experimental results on seven public datasets for both classification and regression demonstrate that FedWQ-CP empirically maintains agent-wise and global coverage while producing the smallest prediction sets or intervals.

Abstract: Machine learning techniques are now routinely encountered in research laboratories across the globe. Impressive progress has been made through ML and AI techniques with regards to large data set processing. This progress has increased the ability of the experimenter to digest data and make novel predictions regarding phenomena of interest. However, machine learning predictors generated from data sets taken from the natural sciences are often treated as black boxes which are used broadly and generally without detailed consideration of the causal structure of the data set of interest. Work has been attempted to bring causality into discussions of machine learning models of natural phenomena; however, a firm and unified theoretical treatment is lacking. This series of three papers explores the union of chemical theory, biological theory, probability theory and causality that will correct current causal flaws of machine learning in the natural sciences. This paper, Part 1 of the series, provides the formal framework of the foundational causal structure of phenomena in chemical biology and is extended to machine learning through the novel concept of focus, defined here as the ability of a machine learning algorithm to narrow down to a hidden underpinning mechanism in large data sets. Initial proof of these principles on a family of Akt inhibitors is also provided. The second paper containing Part 2 will provide a formal exploration of chemical similarity, and Part 3 will present extensive experimental evidence of how hidden causal structures weaken all machine learning in chemical biology. This series serves to establish for chemical biology a new kind of mathematical framework for modeling mechanisms in Nature without the need for the tools of reductionism: inferential mechanics.

<details>

Motivation: 现有评估方法仅检查数据集的边际分布准确性，缺乏对模型预测后验分布的直接评估方法，而真正的后验分布在实际中不可得。

Method: 引入信息增益（IG）作为严格适当的评分规则，为预测后验提供理论依据和可解释性，允许跨模型和跨特征比较结果。

Result: 在广泛的HTS数据集上评估扩散和GAN模型，IG能够揭示其他指标无法检测的显着性能差异。

Conclusion: IG为生成虚拟染色模型提供了一种可解释、可比较的细胞级预测后验评估方法，是现有评估协议的有效补充。

Abstract: Generative virtual staining (VS) models for high-throughput screening (HTS) can provide an estimated posterior distribution of possible biological feature values for each input and cell. However, when evaluating a VS model, the true posterior is unavailable. Existing evaluation protocols only check the accuracy of the marginal distribution over the dataset rather than the predicted posteriors. We introduce information gain (IG) as a cell-wise evaluation framework that enables direct assessment of predicted posteriors. IG is a strictly proper scoring rule and comes with a sound theoretical motivation allowing for interpretability, and for comparing results across models and features. We evaluate diffusion- and GAN-based models on an extensive HTS dataset using IG and other metrics and show that IG can reveal substantial performance differences other metrics cannot.

Conclusion: ParamMem作为增强语言智能体的有效组件，通过提升反思多样性显著改善了智能体的推理能力，展现了参数化记忆的潜力。

Abstract: Self-reflection enables language agents to iteratively refine solutions, yet often produces repetitive outputs that limit reasoning performance. Recent studies have attempted to address this limitation through various approaches, among which increasing reflective diversity has shown promise. Our empirical analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between reflective diversity and task success, further motivating the need for diverse reflection signals. We introduce ParamMem, a parametric memory module that encodes cross-sample reflection patterns into model parameters, enabling diverse reflection generation through temperature-controlled sampling. Building on this module, we propose ParamAgent, a reflection-based agent framework that integrates parametric memory with episodic and cross-sample memory. Extensive experiments on code generation, mathematical reasoning, and multi-hop question answering demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines. Further analysis reveals that ParamMem is sample-efficient, enables weak-to-strong transfer across model scales, and supports self-improvement without reliance on stronger external model, highlighting the potential of ParamMem as an effective component for enhancing language agents.

Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have emphasized the integration of structured optimization components into end-to-end differentiable models, enabling richer inductive biases and tighter alignment with task-specific objectives. In this work, we introduce a novel differentiable approximation to the zero-one loss-long considered the gold standard for classification performance, yet incompatible with gradient-based optimization due to its non-differentiability. Our method constructs a smooth, order-preserving projection onto the n,k-dimensional hypersimplex through a constrained optimization framework, leading to a new operator we term Soft-Binary-Argmax. After deriving its mathematical properties, we show how its Jacobian can be efficiently computed and integrated into binary and multiclass learning systems. Empirically, our approach achieves significant improvements in generalization under large-batch training by imposing geometric consistency constraints on the output logits, thereby narrowing the performance gap traditionally observed in large-batch training.

Abstract: Coarse data arise when learners observe only partial information about samples; namely, a set containing the sample rather than its exact value. This occurs naturally through measurement rounding, sensor limitations, and lag in economic systems. We study Gaussian mean estimation from coarse data, where each true sample $x$ is drawn from a $d$-dimensional Gaussian distribution with identity covariance, but is revealed only through the set of a partition containing $x$. When the coarse samples, roughly speaking, have ``low'' information, the mean cannot be uniquely recovered from observed samples (i.e., the problem is not identifiable). Recent work by Fotakis, Kalavasis, Kontonis, and Tzamos [FKKT21] established that sample-efficient mean estimation is possible when the unknown mean is identifiable and the partition consists of only convex sets. Moreover, they showed that without convexity, mean estimation becomes NP-hard. However, two fundamental questions remained open: (1) When is the mean identifiable under convex partitions? (2) Is computationally efficient estimation possible under identifiability and convex partitions? This work resolves both questions. [...]

TL;DR: FlashOptim通过权重分片量化和压缩函数技术，将每个参数的训练内存从16字节降至7-5字节，减少超过50%，同时保持模型质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前混合精度训练每个参数需要16字节内存（包含参数、梯度、优化器状态），这使得7B参数模型训练需要超过100GB显存，限制了资源有限研究者的使用。需要一种减少内存占用但不损失模型质量的方法。

Method: 1) 改进主权权重分片技术，通过寻找并利用量化误差的紧致边界来减少误差；2) 设计压缩函数大幅降低8位优化器状态量化的误差。结合16位梯度，实现从16字节到7字节（或5字节带梯度释放）的内存优化。

Result: 在SGD、AdamW和Lion优化器上应用FlashOptim，在多个标准视觉和语言基准测试（包括Llama-3.1-8B微调）中均未观察到明显的质量下降，同时模型检查点大小减少超过一半。

Conclusion: FlashOptim套件成功减少超过50%的每个参数内存需求，同时保持模型质量和API兼容性，使资源有限的研究者能够训练更大模型。

Abstract: Standard mixed-precision training of neural networks requires many bytes of accelerator memory for each model parameter. These bytes reflect not just the parameter itself, but also its gradient and one or more optimizer state variables. With each of these values typically requiring 4 bytes, training even a 7 billion parameter model can be impractical for researchers with less than 100GB of accelerator memory.
  We introduce FlashOptim, a suite of optimizations that reduces per-parameter memory by over 50% while preserving model quality and API compatibility. Our approach introduces two key techniques. First, we improve master weight splitting by finding and exploiting a tight bound on its quantization error. Second, we design companding functions that greatly reduce the error in 8-bit optimizer state quantization. Together with 16-bit gradients, these techniques reduce AdamW memory from 16 bytes to 7 bytes per parameter, or 5 bytes with gradient release. They also cut model checkpoint sizes by more than half.
  Experiments with FlashOptim applied to SGD, AdamW, and Lion show no measurable quality degradation on any task from a collection of standard vision and language benchmarks, including Llama-3.1-8B finetuning.

Abstract: The Platonic Representation Hypothesis posits that neural networks trained on different modalities converge toward a shared statistical model of the world. Recent work exploits this convergence by aligning frozen pretrained vision and language models with lightweight alignment layers, but typically relies on contrastive losses and millions of paired samples. In this work, we ask whether meaningful alignment can be achieved with substantially less supervision. We introduce a semi-supervised setting in which pretrained unimodal encoders are aligned using a small number of image-text pairs together with large amounts of unpaired data. To address this challenge, we propose SOTAlign, a two-stage framework that first recovers a coarse shared geometry from limited paired data using a linear teacher, then refines the alignment on unpaired samples via an optimal-transport-based divergence that transfers relational structure without overconstraining the target space. Unlike existing semi-supervised methods, SOTAlign effectively leverages unpaired images and text, learning robust joint embeddings across datasets and encoder pairs, and significantly outperforming supervised and semi-supervised baselines.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: A dataset server must often distribute the same large payload to many clients, incurring massive communication costs. Since clients frequently operate on diverse hardware and software frameworks, transmitting a pre-trained model is often infeasible; instead, agents require raw data to train their own task-specific models locally. While dataset distillation attempts to compress training signals, current methods struggle to scale to high-resolution data and rarely achieve sufficiently small files. In this paper, we propose Pseudo-Labels as Data (PLADA), a method that completely eliminates pixel transmission. We assume agents are preloaded with a large, generic, unlabeled reference dataset (e.g., ImageNet-1K, ImageNet-21K) and communicate a new task by transmitting only the class labels for specific images. To address the distribution mismatch between the reference and target datasets, we introduce a pruning mechanism that filters the reference dataset to retain only the labels of the most semantically relevant images for the target task. This selection process simultaneously maximizes training efficiency and minimizes transmission payload. Experiments on 10 diverse datasets demonstrate that our approach can transfer task knowledge with a payload of less than 1 MB while retaining high classification accuracy, offering a promising solution for efficient dataset serving.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: All-to-all GPU communication is a critical bottleneck in large-scale training clusters, where completion time is constrained by per-port bandwidth and can be severely impacted by traffic skew across GPUs and network interface cards (NICs). This issue is amplified by the two-tier structure of modern GPU systems, which combine fast intra-server links with much slower inter-server networks. Motivated by recent system observations that highlight the importance of traffic reshaping and hierarchy awareness, we study all-to-all scheduling from an online switching and queueing-theoretic perspective.
  We propose a dynamic hierarchical Birkhoff--von Neumann (BvN) decomposition framework tailored to two-tier GPU fabrics. At each frame boundary, traffic is first balanced within each server using simple local operations to mitigate micro-level GPU/NIC skew while preserving aggregate server-to-server demand. A hierarchical BvN decomposition is then applied at the server level and refined into GPU-level matchings, significantly reducing decomposition complexity relative to a flat GPU-level approach. By integrating this construction with the dynamic frame sizing (DFS) principle, we obtain an online scheduler with provable stability under admissible Poisson arrivals. Simulations demonstrate substantial reductions in mean frame length, particularly under server-localized hotspot traffic.

TL;DR: 一种结合混合注意力变换器与残差学习的新型U-Net变体HARU-Net，用于解决CBCT数据中低剂量采集导致的强噪声问题，在性能与计算效率上均优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CBCT广泛用于口腔颌面成像，但低剂量采集会引入强烈的、空间变化的噪声，损害软组织可见度并模糊精细解剖结构。现有经典去噪方法难以在抑制噪声的同时保持边缘，而基于深度学习的方法则受限于高分辨率CBCT数据的稀缺性。

Method: 提出HARU-Net（混合注意力残差U-Net），该模型融合了三个互补的架构组件：(1) 嵌入每个跳跃连接中的混合注意力变换器块(HAB)，以选择性强调显著解剖特征；(2) 瓶颈处的残差混合注意力变换器组(RHAG)，用于增强全局上下文建模和长程特征交互；(3) 残差学习卷积块，以促进更深层、更稳定的特征提取。模型基于人类半下颌骨尸体数据集进行训练，数据使用3D Accuitomo 170 CBCT系统的高分辨率协议采集。

Result: HARU-Net在PSNR(37.52 dB)、SSIM(0.9557)和GMSD(0.1084)指标上均优于SwinIR和Uformer等先进方法，且计算成本显著低于现有SOTA方法，实现了高效且临床可靠的CBCT去噪。

Conclusion: HARU-Net在低剂量CBCT图像去噪中表现出卓越的性能与实用性，为提高低剂量CBCT成像的诊断质量提供了有效的技术进展。

Abstract: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is widely used in dental and maxillofacial imaging, but low-dose acquisition introduces strong, spatially varying noise that degrades soft-tissue visibility and obscures fine anatomical structures. Classical denoising methods struggle to suppress noise in CBCT while preserving edges. Although deep learning-based approaches offer high-fidelity restoration, their use in CBCT denoising is limited by the scarcity of high-resolution CBCT data for supervised training. To address this research gap, we propose a novel Hybrid Attention Residual U-Net (HARU-Net) for high-quality denoising of CBCT data, trained on a cadaver dataset of human hemimandibles acquired using a high-resolution protocol of the 3D Accuitomo 170 (J. Morita, Kyoto, Japan) CBCT system. The novel contribution of this approach is the integration of three complementary architectural components: (i) a hybrid attention transformer block (HAB) embedded within each skip connection to selectively emphasize salient anatomical features, (ii) a residual hybrid attention transformer group (RHAG) at the bottleneck to strengthen global contextual modeling and long-range feature interactions, and (iii) residual learning convolutional blocks to facilitate deeper, more stable feature extraction throughout the network. HARU-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods including SwinIR and Uformer, achieving the highest PSNR (37.52 dB), highest SSIM (0.9557), and lowest GMSD (0.1084). This effective and clinically reliable CBCT denoising is achieved at a computational cost significantly lower than that of the SOTA methods, offering a practical advancement toward improving diagnostic quality in low-dose CBCT imaging.

Abstract: Small, low-size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly used for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) missions due to their affordability, attritability, and suitability for distributed operations. However, their design poses challenges including limited endurance, constrained payload capacity, and reliance on simple sensing modalities such as fixed-field-of-view, bearing-only cameras. Traditional platform-centric methods cannot capture the coupled performance, cost, and coordination trade-offs that emerge at the system-of-systems level.
  This paper presents a mission engineering framework for early-phase design of low-SWaP-C UAV ISR architectures. The framework integrates design of experiments, multi-objective optimization, and high-fidelity simulation into a closed-loop process linking design variables to estimator-informed performance and mission cost. Candidate architectures are explored via Latin hypercube sampling and refined using a genetic algorithm, with performance evaluated through Monte Carlo trials of a federated Kalman filter benchmarked against the posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound. Validation follows the Validation Square methodology, combining theoretical, empirical, and structural assessments.
  A case study on man-overboard localization in a GNSS-denied maritime environment shows that localization accuracy saturates at sub-meter levels, while higher-cost configurations primarily add redundancy and resilience. The framework thus quantifies mission trade-offs between performance, affordability, and robustness, providing a scalable decision-support tool for contested, resource-constrained ISR missions.

Motivation: 当前研究只监控多区域建筑中的少数区域来计算节能效果时，会因忽略区域间热传递而导致高估。作者希望通过数学分析量化这种误差，并开发更准确的估算方法。

Method: 1. 数学分析线性动态系统和以热负荷为线性目标的节能优化问题中的高估误差

Conclusion: 单纯控制多区域建筑中的部分区域会导致节能效果被显著高估；提出的基于温度测量的新方法能够更准确地估算实际节能，且不需要复杂的基准能耗建模，简化了测量和验证过程。

Abstract: How much energy, money, and emissions can advanced control of heating and cooling equipment save in real buildings? To address this question, researchers sometimes control a small number of thermal zones within a larger multi-zone building, then report savings for the controlled zones only. That approach can overestimate savings by neglecting heat transfer between controlled zones and adjacent zones. This paper mathematically characterizes the overestimation error when the dynamics are linear and the objectives are linear in the thermal load, as usually holds when optimizing energy efficiency, energy costs, or emissions. Overestimation errors can be large even in seemingly innocuous situations. For example, when controlling only interior zones that have no direct thermal contact with the outdoors, all perceived savings are fictitious. This paper provides an alternative estimation method based on the controlled and adjacent zones' temperature measurements. The new method does not require estimating how much energy the building would have used under baseline operations, so it removes the additional measurement and verification challenge of accurate baseline estimation.

Abstract: This paper proposes HyperKKL, a novel learning approach for designing Kazantzis-Kravaris/Luenberger (KKL) observers for non-autonomous nonlinear systems. While KKL observers offer a rigorous theoretical framework by immersing nonlinear dynamics into a stable linear latent space, its practical realization relies on solving Partial Differential Equations (PDE) that are analytically intractable. Current existing learning-based approximations of the KKL observer are mostly designed for autonomous systems, failing to generalize to driven dynamics without expensive retraining or online gradient updates. HyperKKL addresses this by employing a hypernetwork architecture that encodes the exogenous input signal to instantaneously generate the parameters of the KKL observer, effectively learning a family of immersion maps parameterized by the external drive. We rigorously evaluate this approach against a curriculum learning strategy that attempts to generalize from autonomous regimes via training heuristics alone. The novel approach is illustrated on four numerical simulations in benchmark examples including the Duffing, Van der Pol, Lorenz, and Rössler systems.

Abstract: The next industrial revolution, Industry 5.0, will be driven by advanced technologies that foster human-machine collaboration (HMC). It will leverage human creativity, judgment, and dexterity with the machine's strength, precision, and speed to improve productivity, quality of life, and sustainability. Wireless communications, empowered by the emerging capabilities of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, will play a central role in enabling flexible, scalable, and low-cost deployment of geographically distributed HMC systems. In this article, we first introduce the generic architecture and key components of wireless HMC (WHMC). We then present the network topologies of WHMC and highlight impactful applications across various industry sectors.

Abstract: Opacity has emerged as a central confidentiality notion for information-flow security in discrete event systems (DES), capturing the requirement that an external observer (intruder) should never be able to determine with certainty whether the system is, was, or will be in a secret state. This article provides a concise, newcomer-friendly overview of opacity in DES, emphasizing core definitions and the unifying estimation viewpoint behind major opacity notions,. We summarize representative verification techniques and highlight how different observation models reshape both the problem formulation and algorithmic structure. We then review principal enforcement paradigms, ranging from opacity-enforcing supervisory control to sensor activation/information release optimization and obfuscation/editing mechanisms. Beyond finite automata, we outline how opacity has been studied in richer models such as stochastic systems, timed systems, Petri nets, and continuous/hybrid dynamics, and we briefly survey applications in robotics, location privacy, and information services. Finally, we discuss selected open challenges, including solvability under incomparable information, scalable methods beyond worst-case complexity, and opacity under intelligent or data-driven adversaries.

Abstract: Emerging applications such as autonomous driving and industrial automation demand ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC), where maintaining fresh and timely information is critical. A key performance metric in such systems is the age of information (AoI). This paper addresses AoI minimization in a multi-user uplink wireless network using non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), where users offload tasks to a base station. The system must handle user heterogeneity in task sizes, AoI thresholds, and penalty sensitivities, while adhering to NOMA constraints on user scheduling. We propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework based on proximal policy optimization (PPO), enhanced with a Transformer encoder. The attention mechanism allows the agent to focus on critical user states and capture inter-user dependencies, improving policy performance and scalability. Extensive simulations show that our method reduces average AoI compared to baselines. We also analyze the evolution of attention weights during training and observe that the model progressively learns to prioritize high-importance users. Attention maps reveal meaningful structure: early-stage policies exhibit uniform attention, while later stages show focused patterns aligned with user priority and NOMA constraints. These results highlight the promise of attention-driven DRL for intelligent, priority-aware resource allocation in next-generation wireless systems.

Abstract: This paper addresses the steady state covariance steering for linear dynamical systems via structural intervention on the system matrix. We formulate the covariance steering problem as the minimization of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the steady state and target Gaussian distributions. To solve the problem, we develop a solution method, hereafter referred to as the proximal gradient-based algorithm, of promoting sparsity in the structural intervention by integrating the objective into a proximal gradient framework with L1 regularization. The main contribution of this paper lies in the analytical expression of the KL divergence gradient with respect to the intervention matrix: the gradient is characterized by the solutions to two Lyapunov equations related to the state covariance equation and its adjoint. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proximal gradient-based algorithm effectively identifies sparse, structurally-constrained interventions to achieve precise covariance steering.

Abstract: This paper investigates the position-tracking control problem for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with a turbojet engine via an integrated flight and propulsion control scheme. To this end, a hierarchical control framework with thrust and disturbance compensation is proposed. In particular, we first propose a perturbed fixed-wing UAV model with turbojet engine dynamics, accounting for both unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances. Second, a versatile extended observer is designed to handle both unmeasurable thrust dynamics and external disturbances. Third, a hierarchical control framework is implemented using three observer-based controllers to guarantee position-tracking performance. With the proposed control strategy, we prove that the closed-loop system asymptotically converges to the desired trajectory. Finally, a comparative simulation is performed to illustrate the proposed control strategy.

Abstract: We propose a signal temporal logic (STL)-based framework that rigorously verifies the feasibility of a mission described in STL and synthesizes control to safely execute it. The proposed framework ensures safe and reliable operation through two phases. First, the proposed framework assesses the feasibility of STL by computing a backward reachable tube (BRT), which captures all states that can satisfy the given STL, regardless of the initial state. The proposed framework accommodates the multiple reach-avoid (MRA) problem to address more general STL specifications and leverages a deep neural network to alleviate the computation burden for reachability analysis, reducing the computation time by about 1000 times compared to a baseline method. We further propose a layered planning and control architecture that combines mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) for global planning with model predictive control (MPC) as a local controller for the verified STL. Consequently, the proposed framework can robustly handle unexpected behavior of obstacles that are not described in the environment information or STL, thereby providing reliable mission performance. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework can successfully compute BRT for a given STL and perform the mission.

Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces have emerged as a promising hardware platform for shaping wireless propagation environments at millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) frequencies and beyond. While many existing studies emphasize channel modeling and signal processing, practical RIS deployment is fundamentally governed by hardware design choices and their system-level implications. This paper presents a hardware-centric overview of recent mm-Wave RIS developments, covering wideband realizations, high-resolution phase-quantized designs, fully printed low-cost implementations, optically transparent surfaces, RIS-on-chip solutions, and emerging three-dimensional architectures. Key challenges including mutual coupling, calibration, multi-RIS interaction, and frequency-dependent phase control are discussed to bridge hardware realization with system-level optimization. This overview provides practical design insights and aims to guide future RIS research toward scalable, efficient, and practically deployable intelligent surface architectures.
