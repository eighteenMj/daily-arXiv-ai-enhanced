Recent studies have shown that self-dictionary methods can achieve high extraction accuracy; however, their high computational cost limits their applicability to large-scale hyperspectral images. Although several approaches have been proposed to mitigate this issue, it remains a major challenge. Motivated by this situation, this paper pursues a data reduction approach. Assuming that the hyperspectral image follows the linear mixing model with the pure-pixel assumption, we develop a data reduction technique that removes pixels that do not contain endmembers. We analyze the theoretical properties of this reduction step and show that it preserves pixels that lie close to the endmembers. Building on this result, we propose a data-reduced self-dictionary method that integrates the data reduction with a self-dictionary method based on a linear programming formulation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can substantially reduce the computational time of the original self-dictionary method without sacrificing endmember extraction accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Neither of the proposed frameworks, however, can achieve satisfactory performance when facing a platform residual phase error (PRPE) arising from the instability of airborne platforms. More importantly, in spite of the significance of real-time processing requirements in remote sensing applications, these prior works have only focused on enhancing the quality of the formed image, not reducing the computational burden. To address these two concerns, this article presents a fast and unified joint SAR imaging framework where the dominant sparse objects and low-rank features of the image background are decomposed and enhanced through a robust LRSD. In particular, our unified algorithm circumvents the tedious task of computing the inverse of large matrices for image formation and takes advantage of the recent advances in constrained quadratic programming to handle the unimodular constraint imposed due to the PRPE. Furthermore, we extend our approach to ISAR autofocusing and imaging. Specifically, due to the intrinsic sparsity of ISAR images, the LRSD framework is essentially tasked with the recovery of a sparse image.

While recent foundation models for echocardiography can achieve strong performance on individual perceptual subtasks such as view classification, segmentation, or disease prediction, they typically operate in isolation and do not provide a unified, clinically coherent assessment. In this work, we introduce Echo-CoPilot, a multi-view, multi-task agent that uses a large language model to orchestrate a suite of specialized echocardiography tools. Within a ReAct-style loop, the agent decomposes clinician queries, invokes tools for view recognition, cardiac structure segmentation, measurement and disease prediction, and report synthesis, and integrates their outputs into guideline-aware answers and narrative summaries. We evaluate Echo-CoPilot on the public MIMIC-EchoQA benchmark, where it achieves an accuracy of 50.8\\%, outperforming both general-purpose and biomedical video vision-language models. Qualitative analyses further show that the agent leverages quantitative measurements and physiologic context to resolve challenging cases near clinical decision thresholds, such as borderline left ventricular hypertrophy or pericardial effusion severity.

Accepted to ITCS 2026", "summary": "In this paper we study a basic and natural question about Fourier analysis of Boolean functions, which has applications to the study of Matching Vector based Private Information Retrieval (PIR) schemes. For integers m and r, define a delta function on {0,1}^r to be a function f: Z_m^r -> C with f(0) = 1 and f(x) = 0 for all nonzero Boolean x. The basic question we study is how small the Fourier sparsity of a delta function can be; namely how sparse such an f can be in the Fourier basis?\n  In addition to being intrinsically interesting and natural, such questions arise naturally when studying \"S-decoding polynomials\" for the known matching vector families. Finding S-decoding polynomials of reduced sparsity, which corresponds to finding delta functions with low Fourier sparsity, would improve the current best PIR schemes.\n  We show nontrivial upper and lower bounds on the Fourier sparsity of delta functions. Our proofs are elementary and clean. These results imply limitations on improving Matching Vector PIR schemes simply by finding better S-decoding polynomials. In particular, there are no S-decoding polynomials that can make Matching Vector PIRs based on the known matching vector families achieve polylogarithmic communication with a constant number of servers.

Such capabilities are vital for enabling seamless and responsive interaction in emerging technologies like augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), where understanding user gaze is key to immersion and interface design. Neuromorphic sensors and spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising alternative, yet existing SNN approaches are either too specialized or fall short of the performance of modern ANN architectures. This paper presents a neuromorphic version of top-performing event-based eye-tracking models, replacing their recurrent and attention modules with lightweight LIF layers and exploiting depth-wise separable convolutions to reduce model complexity. Our models obtain 3.7-4.1px mean error, approaching the accuracy of the application-specific neuromorphic system, Retina (3.24px), while reducing model size by 20x and theoretical compute by 850x, compared to the closest ANN variant of the proposed model. These efficient variants are projected to operate at an estimated 3.9-4.9 mW with 3 ms latency at 1 kHz. The present results indicate that high-performing event-based eye-tracking architectures can be redesigned as SNNs with substantial efficiency gains, while retaining accuracy suitable for real-time wearable deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u773c\u52a8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528LIF\u5c42\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u5377\u79ef\uff0c\u5728\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e13\u4e1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e27\u7684\u773c\u52a8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684SNN\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u8fc7\u4e8e\u4e13\u4e1a\u5316\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u5982\u73b0\u4ee3ANN\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u773c\u52a8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u652f\u6301AR/VR\u7b49\u65b0\u5174\u6280\u672f\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6027\u80fd\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u773c\u52a8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u9020\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u7248\u672c\uff0c\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7LIF\u5c42\u66ff\u6362\u539f\u6709\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u5377\u79ef\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u52303.7-4.1px\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u4e13\u4e1a\u795e\u7ecf\u5f62\u6001\u7cfb\u7edfRetina\uff083.24px\uff09\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u63a5\u8fd1\u7684ANN\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5927\u5c0f\u51cf\u5c1120\u500d\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u964d\u4f4e850\u500d\u3002\u9884\u8ba1\u529f\u8017\u4e3a3.9-4.9 mW\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf3 ms\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u773c\u52a8\u8ffd\u8e2a\u67b6\u6784\u53ef\u4ee5\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e3aSNN\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u65f6\u53ef\u7a7f\u6234\u90e8\u7f72\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

We've developed ExaCraft, an AI system that generates personalized examples by adapting to the learner's dynamic context. Through the Google Gemini AI and Python Flask API, accessible via a Chrome extension, ExaCraft combines user-defined profiles (including location, education, profession, and complexity preferences) with real-time analysis of learner behavior. This ensures examples are both culturally relevant and tailored to individual learning needs. The system's core innovation is its ability to adapt to five key aspects of the learning context: indicators of struggle, mastery patterns, topic progression history, session boundaries, and learning progression signals.

Although CBF-based safety filters are often implemented by solving a quadratic program (QP) in real time, the use of off-the-shelf solvers for such optimization problems poses a challenge in applications where control actions need to be computed efficiently at very high frequencies. In this paper, we introduce a closed-form expression for controllers obtained through CBF-based safety filters.

Among weakly supervised approaches, horizontal bounding box (HBox)-supervised OOD stands out for its ability to directly leverage existing HBox annotations while achieving the highest accuracy under weak supervision settings. This paper introduces adaptive bounding box scaling and symmetry-prior-based orientation prediction, called ABBSPO, a framework for WS-OOD. Our ABBSPO addresses limitations of previous HBox-supervised OOD methods, which compare ground truth (GT) HBoxes directly with the minimum circumscribed rectangles of predicted RBoxes, often leading to inaccurate scale estimation. To overcome this, we propose: (i) Adaptive Bounding Box Scaling (ABBS), which appropriately scales GT HBoxes to optimize for the size of each predicted RBox, ensuring more accurate scale prediction; and (ii) a Symmetric Prior Angle (SPA) loss that exploits inherent symmetry of aerial objects for self-supervised learning, resolving issues in previous methods where learning collapses when predictions for all three augmented views (original, rotated, and flipped) are consistently incorrect.

Coarse-grained, model-level methods yield only a sparse set of suboptimal solutions, while fine-grained, layer-wise approaches suffer from the \"curse of dimensionality,\" rendering the search space computationally intractable. To resolve this dichotomy, we propose BAMBO (Bayesian Adaptive Multi-objective Block-wise Optimization), a novel framework that automatically constructs the LLM Pareto set. BAMBO renders the search tractable by introducing a Hybrid Optimal Block Partitioning strategy. Formulated as a 1D clustering problem, this strategy leverages a dynamic programming approach to optimally balance intra-block homogeneity and inter-block information distribution, thereby dramatically reducing dimensionality without sacrificing critical granularity. The entire process is automated within an evolutionary loop driven by the q-Expected Hypervolume Improvement (qEHVI) acquisition function.

In this work, we propose a different paradigm by adopting diffusion models to provide suggestions to the autoregressive generation rather than replacing them. By doing so, we combine the bidirectional and refining capabilities of the former with the strong linguistic structure provided by the latter. To showcase its effectiveness, we present Show, Suggest and Tell (SST), which achieves State-of-the-Art results on COCO, among models in a similar setting. In particular, SST achieves 125.1 CIDEr-D on the COCO dataset without Reinforcement Learning, outperforming both autoregressive and diffusion model State-of-the-Art results by 1.5 and 2.5 points.

Standard world models typically rely on action-conditioned trajectories, which limits effectiveness when action labels are scarce. We introduce a family of latent-action world models that jointly use action-conditioned and action-free data by learning a shared latent action representation. This latent space aligns observed control signals with actions inferred from passive observations, enabling a single dynamics model to train on large-scale unlabeled trajectories while requiring only a small set of action-labeled ones. We use the latent-action world model to learn a latent-action policy through offline reinforcement learning (RL), thereby bridging two traditionally separate domains: offline RL, which typically relies on action-conditioned data, and action-free training, which is rarely used with subsequent RL. On the DeepMind Control Suite, our approach achieves strong performance while using about an order of magnitude fewer action-labeled samples than purely action-conditioned baselines.

The proposed method rapidly estimates key frequency parameters under a dynamic set of disturbances, which are continuously updated based on operating conditions and unit commitment. To achieve this, the framework builds on a modal-based formulation of the system frequency response (SFR), which leverages the system's eigenstructure to predict key frequency stability metrics. A Deep Sets-inspired neural network is employed to estimate the complex modal coefficients required by the modal-based SFR approach, formulated as a permutation-equivariant learning problem. This enables fast and accurate prediction of the frequency nadir and its timing across different operating conditions and disturbances. The framework achieves scalability by reusing precomputed modal structures and updating only the disturbance-specific coefficients. It demonstrates strong generalization capabilities without requiring an extensive set of operating scenarios during training or the widespread deployment of phasor measurement units (PMUs). The method is validated on the IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus systems, showing superior accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency compared to purely data-driven approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Most of these approaches are trained to model conditional distributions defined by a specific predictive direction with a specific set of input variables. We introduce MetaVoxel, a generative joint diffusion modeling framework that models the joint distribution over imaging data and clinical metadata by learning a single diffusion process spanning all variables. By capturing the joint distribution, MetaVoxel unifies tasks that traditionally require separate conditional models and supports flexible zero-shot inference using arbitrary subsets of inputs without task-specific retraining. Using more than 10,000 T1-weighted MRI scans paired with clinical metadata from nine datasets, we show that a single MetaVoxel model can perform image generation, age estimation, and sex prediction, achieving performance comparable to established task-specific baselines. Additional experiments highlight its capabilities for flexible inference.Together, these findings demonstrate that joint multimodal diffusion offers a promising direction for unifying medical AI models and enabling broader clinical applicability.", "AI": {"tldr": "MetaVoxel is a joint diffusion modeling framework that unifies multimodal clinical AI tasks by modeling the joint distribution of imaging data and metadata in a single diffusion process.", "motivation": "Existing deep learning approaches typically train separate conditional models for specific predictive tasks, lacking flexibility for zero-shot inference and requiring task-specific retraining for different clinical applications.", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u751f\u6210\u8054\u5408\u6269\u6563\u5efa\u6a21\u6846\u67b6MetaVoxel\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u8986\u76d6\u6240\u6709\u53d8\u91cf\uff08\u5f71\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u5143\u6570\u636e\uff09\u7684\u5355\u4e00\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u8054\u5408\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7edf\u4e00\u4f20\u7edf\u4e0a\u9700\u8981\u5355\u72ec\u6761\u4ef6\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4f7f\u7528\u4efb\u610f\u8f93\u5165\u5b50\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8d85\u8fc710,000\u4e2aT1\u52a0\u6743MRI\u626b\u63cf\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u5143\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5355\u4e2aMetaVoxel\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6267\u884c\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3001\u5e74\u9f84\u4f30\u8ba1\u548c\u6027\u522b\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8054\u5408\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u533b\u5b66AI\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u4e34\u5e8a\u9002\u7528\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

To our knowledge, this represents the first time such an analysis module has been implemented in the QUCS environment. Hitherto, the only available option was a harmonic-balance module which was strictly limited to non-autonomous (driven) circuits. The research has several important scientific and industrial applications in the area of large-signal steady-state analysis of autonomous circuits e.g. free-running and coupled oscillator circuit networks. The reported results will have great impact w.r.t. analyzing, synthesizing and optimizing oscillatory behavior of various important industrial circuits and systems. The developed tool, furthermore, introduces support for simulating noise performance of circuits operating under large-signal conditions. This paper is the first part of a two-part series documenting the implementation of a novel (coupled)-oscillator phase-noise simulator engine in the QUCS environment. The goal of this undertaking is the advancement of the open-source QUCS project towards becoming a viable competitor to the commercial simulators currently on the market.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

IDE aims to learn the connec- tion between individual words in a sentence and the corresponding features in an image, enabling compositional generalization. We build two models based on the philosophy of IDE. The first one utilizes fully disentangled visual representations as input, and the second leverages a Variational Auto-Encoder to obtain partially disentangled features from raw images.

We propose Heavy-Ball Synthetic Gradient Extrapolation (HB-SGE), a robust first-order method that combines heavy-ball momentum with predictive gradient extrapolation. Unlike classical momentum methods that accumulate historical gradients, HB-SGE estimates future gradient directions using local Taylor approximations, providing adaptive acceleration while maintaining stability. We prove convergence guarantees for strongly convex functions and demonstrate empirically that HB-SGE prevents divergence on problems where NAG and standard momentum fail. On ill-conditioned quadratics (condition number $\u03ba=50$), HB-SGE converges in 119 iterations while both SGD and NAG diverge. On the non-convex Rosenbrock function, HB-SGE achieves convergence in 2,718 iterations where classical momentum methods diverge within 10 steps.

Multiple-Reference Preference Optimization (MRPO) builds on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) by fine-tuning LLMs on preference datasets while regularizing the policy towards a mixture of reference models to leverage their collective desirable properties. However, current methods for setting the reference weights are ad-hoc and statistically unsound, leading to unreliable performance. To address this, we introduce four new weighting strategies: two offline methods that leverage held-out validation signal; one online method that uses a sliding-window estimator to reduce overfitting; and an online method that treats reference weighting as a $K$-armed bandit via Thompson Sampling. Experiments using Qwen2.5-0.5B as the policy model and seven reference models from the Llama, Mistral, Qwen, Yi, and Phi families (0.5B-14B each) show that all 4 of our strategies outperform the current MRPO weighting methods on UltraFeedback and SafeRLHF in preference accuracy. More thought-provokingly, however, we find that single-reference DPO, using any of 6 out of 7 references, consistently outperforms all tested multiple-reference approaches -- calling into question the practical appeal of multiple-reference approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing methods and tools often struggle with the realities of scientific literature: long-context documents, multi-modal content, and reconciling varied and inconsistent fine-grained information across multiple publications into standardized formats. These challenges are further compounded when the desired data schema or extraction ontology changes rapidly, making it difficult to re-architect or fine-tune existing systems. We present SciEx, a modular and composable framework that decouples key components including PDF parsing, multi-modal retrieval, extraction, and aggregation. This design streamlines on-demand data extraction while enabling extensibility and flexible integration of new models, prompting strategies, and reasoning mechanisms. We evaluate SciEx on datasets spanning three scientific topics for its ability to extract fine-grained information accurately and consistently.

Applications such as environmental monitoring and search and rescue require robot swarms to cover large domains under resource constraints, making both coverage efficiency and safety essential. To address the efficiency aspect, we adopt the Density-Driven Control (D$^2$C) framework, which uses optimal transport theory to steer agents according to a reference distribution that encodes spatial coverage priorities. To ensure safety, we incorporate Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) into the framework. While CBFs are commonly used for collision avoidance, we extend their applicability by introducing obstacle-specific formulations for both circular and rectangular shapes. In particular, we analytically derive a unit normal vector based on the agent's position relative to the nearest face of a rectangular obstacle, improving safety enforcement in environments with non-smooth boundaries. Additionally, a velocity-dependent term is incorporated into the CBF to enhance collision avoidance. Simulation results validate the proposed method by demonstrating smoother navigation near obstacles and more efficient area coverage than the existing method, while still ensuring collision-free operation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To achieve this, DAEs must be used to specify the dynamics in each discrete state (or mode in our context). This led to the development of DAE-based equational languages supporting multiple modes, of which Modelica is a popular standard. Mode switching can be time- or state-based. Impulsive behaviors can occur at mode changes. While mode changes are well understood in particular physics (e.g., contact mechanics), this is not the case in physics-agnostic paradigms such as Modelica. This situation causes difficulties for the compilation of programs, often requiring users to manually smooth out mode changes. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for the hot restart at mode changes in such paradigms. We propose a mathematical meaning for hot restarts (such a mathematical meaning does not exist in general), as well as a combined structural and impulse analysis for mode changes, generating the hot restart even in the presence of impulses. Our algorithm detects at compile time if the mode change is insufficiently specified, in which case it returns diagnostics information to the user.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u6a21\u5f0f\u5207\u6362\u4e2d\u70ed\u91cd\u542f\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u70ed\u91cd\u542f\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u5b66\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u51b2\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b58\u5728\u51b2\u91cf\u65f6\u7684\u70ed\u91cd\u542f\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u7f16\u8bd1\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u89c4\u683c\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u5982Modelica\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u6a21\u5f0f\u5207\u6362\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u53d1\u51b2\u91cf\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7269\u7406\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u8303\u5f0f\u5bf9\u6a21\u5f0f\u5207\u6362\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7f16\u8bd1\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7528\u6237\u624b\u52a8\u5e73\u6ed1\u5207\u6362\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u70ed\u91cd\u542f\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5b9a\u4e49\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u7ed3\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\u5206\u6790\u548c\u51b2\u91cf\u5206\u6790\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u6a21\u5f0f\u5207\u6362\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u70ed\u91cd\u542f\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5b58\u5728\u51b2\u91cf\u4e5f\u80fd\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7f16\u8bd1\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\u89c4\u683c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u80fd\u5728\u6a21\u5f0f\u5207\u6362\u65f6\u6b63\u786e\u5904\u7406\u51b2\u91cf\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u70ed\u91cd\u542f\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7f16\u8bd1\u65f6\u8bca\u65ad\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u624b\u52a8\u5e72\u9884\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u65e0\u5173\u5efa\u6a21\u8303\u5f0f\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u5f0f\u5207\u6362\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u70ed\u91cd\u542f\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f16\u8bd1\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7a0b\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

While open-weight LLMs enable local deployment, no single model dominates all tasks, motivating ensemble approaches. However, existing LLM ensembles focus on text generation or classification, leaving NER under-explored. In this context, this work proposes a novel three-step ensemble pipeline for zero-shot NER using similarly capable, locally run LLMs. Our method outperforms individual LLMs in four out of five Portuguese NER datasets by leveraging a heuristic to select optimal model combinations with minimal annotated data. Moreover, we show that ensembles obtained on different source datasets generally outperform individual LLMs in cross-dataset configurations, potentially eliminating the need for annotated data for the current task. Our work advances scalable, low-resource, and zero-shot NER by effectively combining multiple small LLMs without fine-tuning.

However, current work has been mainly focused on indoor, household scenarios. In this work, we present SimWorld-Robotics~(SWR), a simulation platform for embodied AI in large-scale, photorealistic urban environments. Built on Unreal Engine 5, SWR procedurally generates unlimited photorealistic urban scenes populated with dynamic elements such as pedestrians and traffic systems, surpassing prior urban simulations in realism, complexity, and scalability. It also supports multi-robot control and communication. With these key features, we build two challenging robot benchmarks: (1) a multimodal instruction-following task, where a robot must follow vision-language navigation instructions to reach a destination in the presence of pedestrians and traffic; and (2) a multi-agent search task, where two robots must communicate to cooperatively locate and meet each other. Unlike existing benchmarks, these two new benchmarks comprehensively evaluate a wide range of critical robot capacities in realistic scenarios, including (1) multimodal instructions grounding, (2) 3D spatial reasoning in large environments, (3) safe, long-range navigation with people and traffic, (4) multi-robot collaboration, and (5) grounded communication.

To address these issues, we reconstruct a high-resolution 3D complex-valued refractivity model using numerical weather prediction data, and develop a fast and numerically stable non-uniform plane-wave ray tracer. The method remains stable in double precision and delivers a 24-fold speedup over high-precision benchmarks. Comparisons show that boresight-error deviations and path-loss differences between the rigorous method and the uniform-plane-wave approximation remain negligible, even under heavy precipitation. Although rays in a lossy atmosphere experience different phase- and attenuation-direction vectors-forming non-uniform plane waves-the resulting effective attenuation along the path is nearly identical to that predicted by the uniform-plane-wave model. These findings justify the continued use of uniform-plane-wave ray tracing in practical LEO link analyses.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u503c\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u5efa\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u73873D\u590d\u6298\u5c04\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u53d1\u5c55\u5feb\u901f\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u975e\u5747\u5300\u5e73\u9762\u6ce2\u5c04\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f4e\u5730\u7403\u8f68\u9053\u901a\u4fe1\u94fe\u8def\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u5927\u6c14\u6298\u5c04\u7387\u91cd\u5efa\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6709\u9650\u548c\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LEO\u901a\u4fe1\u94fe\u8def\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a1\uff09\u7a00\u758f\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u63a2\u7a7a\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u5efa\u76843D\u5927\u6c14\u6298\u5c04\u7387\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6709\u9650\uff1b2\uff09\u5148\u524d\u975e\u5747\u5300\u5e73\u9762\u6ce2\u5c04\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u503c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u53cc\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u51fa\u73b0\u4e0b\u6ea2\u8bef\u5dee\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6570\u503c\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u62a5\u6570\u636e\u91cd\u5efa\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u73873D\u590d\u6298\u5c04\u7387\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u5feb\u901f\u4e14\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u975e\u5747\u5300\u5e73\u9762\u6ce2\u5c04\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u53cc\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u6bd4\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u57fa\u51c6\u5feb24\u500d\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4e25\u8c28\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0e\u5747\u5300\u5e73\u9762\u6ce2\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6ce2\u675f\u6307\u5411\u8bef\u5dee\u504f\u5dee\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u635f\u8017\u5dee\u5f02\u53ef\u4ee5\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u5f3a\u964d\u96e8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e5f\u662f\u5982\u6b64\u3002\u867d\u7136\u635f\u8017\u5927\u6c14\u4e2d\u7684\u5c04\u7ebf\u4f1a\u5f62\u6210\u975e\u5747\u5300\u5e73\u9762\u6ce2\uff0c\u4f46\u6cbf\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8870\u51cf\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0e\u5747\u5300\u5e73\u9762\u6ce2\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u5728\u5b9e\u9645LEO\u94fe\u8def\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7ee7\u7eed\u4f7f\u7528\u5747\u5300\u5e73\u9762\u6ce2\u5c04\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u6c14\u6298\u5c04\u548c\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Traditional approaches-running the full model on-device or offloading to the cloud face trade-offs in latency, bandwidth, and privacy. Splitting the inference workload between the edge and the cloud offers a balanced solution, but transmitting intermediate features to enable such splitting introduces new bandwidth challenges. To address this, the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) initiated the Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) standard, establishing a bitstream syntax and codec pipeline tailored for compressing intermediate features. This paper presents the design and performance of the Feature Coding Test Model (FCTM), showing significant bitrate reductions-averaging 85.14%-across multiple vision tasks while preserving accuracy. FCM offers a scalable path for efficient and interoperable deployment of intelligent features in bandwidth-limited and privacy-sensitive consumer applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This Letter proposes a method based on the least action principle to estimate the underlying generative directionality of LLMs embedded within agents. By experimentally measuring the transition probabilities between LLM-generated states, we statistically discover a detailed balance in LLM-generated transitions, indicating that LLM generation may not be achieved by generally learning rule sets and strategies, but rather by implicitly learning a class of underlying potential functions that may transcend different LLM architectures and prompt templates. To our knowledge, this is the first discovery of a macroscopic physical law in LLM generative dynamics that does not depend on specific model details.

In this work, we introduce the \\textbf{Parallel Decoder Transformer (PDT)}, a parameter-efficient architecture that embeds coordination primitives directly into the inference process of a frozen pre-trained model.\n  Instead of retraining the base model, PDT injects lightweight \\textit{Speculative Note Conditioning (SNC)} adapters that allow parallel decoding streams to synchronize via a shared, dynamic latent space. We formulate coordination as a \\textit{speculative consensus} problem, where sibling streams broadcast semantic ``notes'' to a global bus, gated by a learned verification head. We validate our approach on a 50,000-step curriculum using a frozen 20B-parameter backbone. Our results demonstrate that PDT achieves effective self-correction, reaching \\textbf{77.8\\% precision} in coverage prediction and recovering approximate serial semantics without modifying the trunk weights.

Most prior work uses natural language to express chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning before producing driving actions. However, text may not be the most efficient representation for reasoning. In this work, we present Latent-CoT-Drive (LCDrive): a model that expresses CoT in a latent language that captures possible outcomes of the driving actions being considered. Our approach unifies CoT reasoning and decision making by representing both in an action-aligned latent space. Instead of natural language, the model reasons by interleaving (1) action-proposal tokens, which use the same vocabulary as the model's output actions; and (2) world model tokens, which are grounded in a learned latent world model and express future outcomes of these actions.

While Transformer-based architectures excel at modeling long-range dependencies, their quadratic computational complexity poses limitations on scalability and adaptability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce DB2-TransF, a novel Transformer-inspired architecture that replaces the self-attention mechanism with a learnable Daubechies wavelet coefficient layer. This wavelet-based module efficiently captures multi-scale local and global patterns and enhances the modeling of correlations across multiple time series for the time series forecasting task. Extensive experiments on 13 standard forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that DB2-TransF achieves comparable or superior predictive accuracy to conventional Transformers, while substantially reducing memory usage for the time series forecasting task. The obtained experimental results position DB2-TransF as a scalable and resource-efficient framework for advanced time series forecasting.

Pathways Towards Unifying AI Safety and Ethics Research", "comment": "Accepted for presentation at IASEAI 2026", "summary": "While much research in artificial intelligence (AI) has focused on scaling capabilities, the accelerating pace of development makes countervailing work on producing harmless, \"aligned\" systems increasingly urgent. Yet research on alignment has diverged along two largely parallel tracks: safety--centered on scaled intelligence, deceptive or scheming behaviors, and existential risk--and ethics--focused on present harms, the reproduction of social bias, and flaws in production pipelines. Although both communities warn of insufficient investment in alignment, they disagree on what alignment means or ought to mean. As a result, their efforts have evolved in relative isolation, shaped by distinct methodologies, institutional homes, and disciplinary genealogies.\n  We present a large-scale, quantitative study showing the structural split between AI safety and AI ethics. Using a bibliometric and co-authorship network analysis of 6,442 papers from twelve major ML and NLP conferences (2020-2025), we find that over 80% of collaborations occur within either the safety or ethics communities, and cross-field connectivity is highly concentrated: roughly 5% of papers account for more than 85% of bridging links. Removing a small number of these brokers sharply increases segregation, indicating that cross-disciplinary exchange depends on a handful of actors rather than broad, distributed collaboration. These results show that the safety-ethics divide is not only conceptual but institutional, with implications for research agendas, policy, and venues. We argue that integrating technical safety work with normative ethics--via shared benchmarks, cross-institutional venues, and mixed-method methodologies--is essential for building AI systems that are both robust and just.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

These techniques often rely on knowledge of internal hormone concentrations that cannot be measured from blood samples. Moreover, the measurable concentrations are typically only obtainable at irregular sampling times. In this work, we empirically verify a notion of sample-based detectability that accounts for irregular sampling of the measurable concentrations on two pituitary-thyroid loop models representing patients with hypo- and hyperthyroidism, respectively, and include the internal concentrations as states. We then implement sample-based moving horizon estimation for the models, and test its performance on virtual patients across a range of sampling schemes. Our study shows robust stability of the estimator across all scenarios, and that more frequent sampling leads to less estimation error in the presence of model uncertainty and misreported dosages.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6280\u672f\u5728\u7532\u72b6\u817a\u75be\u75c5\u836f\u7269\u5242\u91cf\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5728\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u6d53\u5ea6\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u91c7\u6837\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u6837\u672c\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u79fb\u52a8\u6c34\u5e73\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b97\u6cd5\u5e76\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6848\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6280\u672f\u6700\u8fd1\u88ab\u7528\u4e8e\u7532\u72b6\u817a\u75be\u75c5\u836f\u7269\u5242\u91cf\u63a8\u8350\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1\uff09\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u67d0\u4e9b\u5185\u90e8\u6fc0\u7d20\u6d53\u5ea6\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u8840\u6db2\u6837\u672c\u6d4b\u91cf\uff1b2\uff09\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u6d53\u5ea6\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u80fd\u5728\u975e\u89c4\u5219\u91c7\u6837\u65f6\u95f4\u83b7\u5f97\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u6d4b\u91cf\u9650\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5728\u4ee3\u8868\u7532\u51cf\u548c\u7532\u4ea2\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5782\u4f53-\u7532\u72b6\u817a\u73af\u8def\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8003\u8651\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u6d53\u5ea6\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6837\u672c\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u7136\u540e\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u79fb\u52a8\u6c34\u5e73\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u865a\u62df\u60a3\u8005\u4e0a\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u8be5\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6848\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u663e\u793a\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5728\u6240\u6709\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9c81\u68d2\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5242\u91cf\u8bef\u62a5\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u66f4\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u4f1a\u51cf\u5c11\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u7532\u72b6\u817a\u75be\u75c5\u836f\u7269\u5242\u91cf\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u6837\u672c\u79fb\u52a8\u6c34\u5e73\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\uff0c\u91c7\u6837\u9891\u7387\u7684\u63d0\u9ad8\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u51cf\u5c11\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5242\u91cf\u8bef\u62a5\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u9ad8\u57fa\u4e8e\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u836f\u7269\u5242\u91cf\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u4f9d\u636e\u3002"}}

These linear representations allow us to explain demographic inferences implicitly formed by LLMs during conversation.

We then demonstrate the existence of supremal prognosable (respectively, diagnosable) and normal sublanguages. Furthermore, an algorithm is then designed to compute the supremal controllable, normal, and prognosable (respectively, diagnosable) sublanguages. Since DESs are typically composed of multiple components operating in parallel, pure local supervisors are generally insufficient, as prognosability and diagnosability are global properties of a system. Given the limited work on enforcing prognosability or diagnosability in modular DESs, where these properties are enforced through local supervisors, this paper leverages a refined version of pre-normality to compute modular supervisors for local subsystems.

However, we identify a fundamental limitation in the standard DPO formulation because it relies on the Bradley-Terry model to aggregate diverse evaluation axes like aesthetic quality and semantic alignment into a single scalar reward. This aggregation creates a reward conflict where the model is forced to unlearn desirable features of a specific dimension if they appear in a globally non-preferred sample. To address this issue, we propose Multi Reward Conditional DPO (MCDPO). This method resolves reward conflicts by introducing a disentangled Bradley-Terry objective. MCDPO explicitly injects a preference outcome vector as a condition during training, which allows the model to learn the correct optimization direction for each reward axis independently within a single network. We further introduce dimensional reward dropout to ensure balanced optimization across dimensions. Extensive experiments on Stable Diffusion 1.5 and SDXL demonstrate that MCDPO achieves superior performance on benchmarks.

Current methods often rely on costly LLM-based techniques (e.g. annotating dataset differences) or dense embedding models (e.g. for clustering), which lack control over the properties of interest. We propose using sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to create SAE embeddings: representations whose dimensions map to interpretable concepts. Through four data analysis tasks, we show that SAE embeddings are more cost-effective and reliable than LLMs and more controllable than dense embeddings. Using the large hypothesis space of SAEs, we can uncover insights such as (1) semantic differences between datasets and (2) unexpected concept correlations in documents. For instance, by comparing model responses, we find that Grok-4 clarifies ambiguities more often than nine other frontier models. Relative to LLMs, SAE embeddings uncover bigger differences at 2-8x lower cost and identify biases more reliably. Additionally, SAE embeddings are controllable: by filtering concepts, we can (3) cluster documents along axes of interest and (4) outperform dense embeddings on property-based retrieval. Using SAE embeddings, we study model behavior with two case studies: investigating how OpenAI model behavior has changed over time and finding \"trigger\" phrases learned by Tulu-3 (Lambert et al., 2024) from its training data.

Despite the availability of powerful open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and their pretraining data, the SSFSL literature largely neglects these open-source resources. In contrast, the related area few-shot learning (FSL) has already exploited them to boost performance. Arguably, to achieve auto-annotation in the real world, SSFSL should leverage such open-source resources. To this end, we start by applying established SSL methods to finetune a VLM. Counterintuitively, they significantly underperform FSL baselines. Our in-depth analysis reveals the root cause: VLMs produce rather ''flat'' distributions of softmax probabilities. This results in zero utilization of unlabeled data and weak supervision signals. We address this issue with embarrassingly simple techniques: classifier initialization and temperature tuning. They jointly increase the confidence scores of pseudo-labels, improving the utilization rate of unlabeled data, and strengthening supervision signals. Building on this, we propose: Stage-Wise Finetuning with Temperature Tuning (SWIFT), which enables existing SSL methods to effectively finetune a VLM on limited labeled data, abundant unlabeled data, and task-relevant but noisy data retrieved from the VLM's pretraining set.

While recent benchmarks advance AIGC video detection, they overlook a critical factor: many state-of-the-art generative models embed digital watermarks in outputs, and detectors may partially rely on these patterns. To evaluate this influence, we present RobustSora, the benchmark designed to assess watermark robustness in AIGC video detection. We systematically construct a dataset of 6,500 videos comprising four types: Authentic-Clean (A-C), Authentic-Spoofed with fake watermarks (A-S), Generated-Watermarked (G-W), and Generated-DeWatermarked (G-DeW). Our benchmark introduces two evaluation tasks: Task-I tests performance on watermark-removed AI videos, while Task-II assesses false alarm rates on authentic videos with fake watermarks. Experiments with ten models spanning specialized AIGC detectors, transformer architectures, and MLLM approaches reveal performance variations of 2-8pp under watermark manipulation. Transformer-based models show consistent moderate dependency (6-8pp), while MLLMs exhibit diverse patterns (2-8pp). These findings indicate partial watermark dependency and highlight the need for watermark-aware training strategies.

The existing method learns the dynamics in each discrete mode, which suffers from the combination of mode switching and discontinuities in the flows. In this work, we propose CHyLL (Continuous Hybrid System Learning in Latent Space), which learns a continuous neural representation of a hybrid system without trajectory segmentation, event functions, or mode switching. The key insight of CHyLL is that the reset map glues the state space at the guard surface, reformulating the state space as a piecewise smooth quotient manifold where the flow becomes spatially continuous. Building upon these insights and the embedding theorems grounded in differential topology, CHyLL concurrently learns a singularity-free neural embedding in a higher-dimensional space and the continuous flow in it. We showcase that CHyLL can accurately predict the flow of hybrid systems with superior accuracy and identify the topological invariants of the hybrid systems.

However, 3D graph convolution (3D-GC) methods only focus on local geometry and depth information, making them vulnerable to complex objects and visual ambiguities. To address this, we present THE-Pose, a novel category-level 6D pose estimation framework that leverages a topological prior via surface embedding and hybrid graph fusion. Specifically, we extract consistent and invariant topological features from the image domain, effectively overcoming the limitations inherent in existing 3D-GC based methods. Our Hybrid Graph Fusion (HGF) module adaptively integrates the topological features with point-cloud features, seamlessly bridging 2D image context and 3D geometric structure. These fused features ensure stability for unseen or complicated objects, even under significant occlusions. Extensive experiments on the REAL275 dataset show that THE-Pose achieves a 35.8% improvement over the 3D-GC baseline (HS-Pose) and surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by 7.2% across all key metrics.

We introduce AgriRegion, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed specifically for high-fidelity, region-aware agricultural advisory. Unlike standard RAG approaches that rely solely on semantic similarity, AgriRegion incorporates a geospatial metadata injection layer and a region-prioritized re-ranking mechanism. By restricting the knowledge base to verified local agricultural extension services and enforcing geo-spatial constraints during retrieval, AgriRegion ensures that the advice regarding planting schedules, pest control, and fertilization is locally accurate. We create a novel benchmark dataset, AgriRegion-Eval, which comprises 160 domain-specific questions across 12 agricultural subfields.

The five members of the Frontier Model Forum we score end up in the middle of the Index: we posit that these companies avoid reputational harms from low scores but lack incentives to be transparency leaders. As policymakers around the world increasingly mandate certain types of transparency, this work reveals the current state of transparency for foundation model developers, how it may change given newly enacted policy, and where more aggressive policy interventions are necessary to address critical information deficits.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing NCD methods for images primarily rely on visual features, which suffer from limitations such as insufficient feature discriminability and the long-tail distribution of data. We propose LLM-NCD, a multimodal framework that breaks this bottleneck by fusing visual-textual semantics and prototype guided clustering. Our key innovation lies in modelling cluster centres and semantic prototypes of known classes by jointly optimising known class image and text features, and a dualphase discovery mechanism that dynamically separates known or novel samples via semantic affinity thresholds and adaptive clustering. Experiments on the CIFAR-100 dataset show that compared to the current methods, this method achieves up to 25.3% improvement in accuracy for unknown classes. Notably, our method shows unique resilience to long tail distributions, a first in NCD literature.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The global availability of large-scale viral sequence data presents significant opportunities for computational analysis; however, existing approaches face notable limitations. Phylogenetic tree-based methods are computationally intensive and do not scale efficiently to today's multi-million-sequence datasets. Similarly, current embedding-based techniques often rely on aligned sequences or exhibit suboptimal predictive performance and high runtime costs, creating barriers to practical large-scale analysis. In this study, we focus on the most prevalent SARS-CoV-2 lineages associated with the spike protein region and introduce a scalable embedding method that leverages hashing to generate compact, low-dimensional representations of spike sequences. These embeddings are subsequently used to train a variety of machine learning models for supervised lineage classification. We conduct an extensive evaluation comparing our approach with multiple baseline and state-of-the-art biological sequence embedding methods across diverse metrics. Our results demonstrate that the proposed embeddings offer substantial improvements in efficiency, achieving up to 86.4\\% classification accuracy while reducing embedding generation time by as much as 99.81\\%.

Although recent large language models (LLMs) show promise for data augmentation, an integrated framework that simultaneously achieves directional control of generation, domain alignment, and quality control has not yet been fully established. To address these challenges, we propose a Cluster-conditioned Interpolative and Extrapolative framework for Geometry-Aware and Domain-aligned data augmentation (CIEGAD), which systematically complements both in-distribution and out-of-distribution semantically uncovered regions. CIEGAD constructs domain profiles through cluster conditioning, allocates generation with a hierarchical frequency-geometric allocation integrating class frequency and geometric indicators, and finely controls generation directions via the coexistence of interpolative and extrapolative synthesis. It further performs quality control through geometry-constrained filtering combined with an LLM-as-a-Judge mechanism. Experiments on multiple classification tasks demonstrate that CIEGAD effectively extends the periphery of real-world data distributions while maintaining high alignment between generated and real-world data as well as semantic diversity. In particular, for long-tailed and multi-class classification tasks, CIEGAD consistently improves F1 and recall, validating the triple harmony of distributional consistency, diversity, and quality.

This new task is not only scientifically challenging but also practically significant, powering downstream applications such as frame-controlled video synthesis and animation.\n  To evaluate model performance on the novel task, we introduce MotionEdit-Bench, a benchmark that challenges models on motion-centric edits and measures model performance with generative, discriminative, and preference-based metrics. Benchmark results reveal that motion editing remains highly challenging for existing state-of-the-art diffusion-based editing models. To address this gap, we propose MotionNFT (Motion-guided Negative-aware Fine Tuning), a post-training framework that computes motion alignment rewards based on how well the motion flow between input and model-edited images matches the ground-truth motion, guiding models toward accurate motion transformations.

In this paper, we explore the potential of reverse thinking methodologies to enhance LLMs' performance on missing information detection tasks.

However, recent progress has primarily focused on low-level visual consistency across shots, neglecting how transitions are designed and how cinematographic language contributes to coherent narrative expression. This often leads to mere sequential shot changes without intentional film-editing patterns. To address this limitation, we propose ShotDirector, an efficient framework that integrates parameter-level camera control and hierarchical editing-pattern-aware prompting. Specifically, we adopt a camera control module that incorporates 6-DoF poses and intrinsic settings to enable precise camera information injection. In addition, a shot-aware mask mechanism is employed to introduce hierarchical prompts aware of professional editing patterns, allowing fine-grained control over shot content. Through this design, our framework effectively combines parameter-level conditions with high-level semantic guidance, achieving film-like controllable shot transitions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we construct ShotWeaver40K, a dataset that captures the priors of film-like editing patterns, and develop a set of evaluation metrics for controllable multi-shot video generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce Neuronal Attention Circuit (NAC), a novel, biologically plausible CT-Attention mechanism that reformulates attention logits computation as the solution to a linear first-order ODE with nonlinear interlinked gates derived from repurposing \\textit{C. elegans} Neuronal Circuit Policies (NCPs) wiring mechanism. NAC replaces dense projections with sparse sensory gates for key-query projections and a sparse backbone network with two heads for computing \\textit{content-target} and \\textit{learnable time-constant} gates, enabling efficient adaptive dynamics. NAC supports three attention logit computation modes: (i) explicit Euler integration, (ii) exact closed-form solution, and (iii) steady-state approximation. To improve memory intensity, we implemented a sparse Top-\\emph{K} pairwise concatenation scheme that selectively curates key-query interactions. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, including state stability, bounded approximation errors, and universal approximation. Empirically, we implemented NAC in diverse domains, including irregular time-series classification, lane-keeping for autonomous vehicles, and industrial prognostics.

Pure low-rank tensor completion, as a classical data recovery method, falls short in handling non-random missingness, both methodologically and theoretically. Hankel-structured tensor completion models provide a feasible approach for recovering multidimensional time series with non-random missing patterns. However, most Hankel-based multidimensional data recovery methods both suffer from unclear sources of Hankel tensor low-rankness and lack an exact recovery theory for non-random missing data. To address these issues, we propose the temporal isometric delay-embedding transform, which constructs a Hankel tensor whose low-rankness is naturally induced by the smoothness and periodicity of the underlying time series. Leveraging this property, we develop the \\textit{Low-Rank Tensor Completion with Temporal Isometric Delay-embedding Transform} (LRTC-TIDT) model, which characterizes the low-rank structure under the \\textit{Tensor Singular Value Decomposition} (t-SVD) framework. Once the prescribed non-random sampling conditions and mild incoherence assumptions are satisfied, the proposed LRTC-TIDT model achieves exact recovery, as confirmed by simulation experiments under various non-random missing patterns. Furthermore, LRTC-TIDT consistently outperforms existing tensor-based methods across multiple real-world tasks, including network flow reconstruction, urban traffic estimation, and temperature field prediction.

In this paper, we propose a novel interpretability framework to systematically analyze the internal mechanisms of VLMs, focusing on the functional roles of attention heads in multimodal reasoning. To this end, we introduce CogVision, a dataset that decomposes complex multimodal questions into step-by-step subquestions designed to simulate human reasoning through a chain-of-thought paradigm, with each subquestion associated with specific receptive or cognitive functions such as high-level visual reception and inference. Using a probing-based methodology, we identify attention heads that specialize in these functions and characterize them as functional heads. Our analysis across diverse VLM families reveals that these functional heads are universally sparse, vary in number and distribution across functions, and mediate interactions and hierarchical organization. Furthermore, intervention experiments demonstrate their critical role in multimodal reasoning: removing functional heads leads to performance degradation, while emphasizing them enhances accuracy. These findings provide new insights into the cognitive organization of VLMs and suggest promising directions for designing models with more human-aligned perceptual and reasoning abilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, their practical development is severely hindered by the substantial training overhead. We recognize two key issues that contribute to the overhead: (1) the quadratic computational burden from processing long-horizon historical observations as massive sequences of tokens, and (2) the exploration-efficiency trade-off in DAgger, i.e., a data aggregation process of collecting agent-explored trajectories. While more exploration yields effective error-recovery trajectories for handling test-time distribution shifts, it comes at the cost of longer trajectory lengths for both training and inference. To address these challenges, we propose Efficient-VLN, a training-efficient VLN model. Specifically, to mitigate the token processing burden, we design two efficient memory mechanisms: a progressive memory that dynamically allocates more tokens to recent observations, and a learnable recursive memory that utilizes the key-value cache of learnable tokens as the memory state. Moreover, we introduce a dynamic mixed policy to balance the exploration-efficiency trade-off. Extensive experiments show that Efficient-VLN achieves state-of-the-art performance on R2R-CE (64.2% SR) and RxR-CE (67.0% SR).

FedDG methods aggregate the parameters of locally trained client models to form a global model that generalizes to unseen clients while preserving data privacy. While improving the generalization capability of the global model, many existing approaches in FedDG jeopardize privacy by sharing statistics of client data between themselves. Our solution addresses this problem by contributing new ways to perform local client training and model aggregation. To improve local client training, we enforce (domain) invariance across local models with the help of a novel technique, \\textbf{latent space inversion}, which enables better client privacy.

In this work, we introduce the Adaptive Information Routing (AIR) framework, a novel approach for multimodal time series forecasting. Unlike existing methods that treat text data on par with time series data as interchangeable auxiliary features for forecasting, AIR leverages text information to dynamically guide the time series model by controlling how and to what extent multivariate time series information should be combined. We also present a text-refinement pipeline that employs a large language model to convert raw text data into a form suitable for multimodal forecasting, and we introduce a benchmark that facilitates multimodal forecasting experiments based on this pipeline.

Vision-language models such as CONCH offer rich semantic alignment and morphology-aware representations, while modern segmentation backbones like SegFormer preserve fine-grained spatial cues. However, combining these complementary strengths remains challenging, especially under weak supervision and without dense annotations. We propose a prototype learning framework for WSSS in histopathological images that integrates morphology-aware representations from CONCH, multi-scale structural cues from SegFormer, and text-guided semantic alignment to produce prototypes that are simultaneously semantically discriminative and spatially coherent. To effectively leverage these heterogeneous sources, we introduce text-guided prototype initialization that incorporates pathology descriptions to generate more complete and semantically accurate pseudo-masks. A structural distillation mechanism transfers spatial knowledge from SegFormer to preserve fine-grained morphological patterns and local tissue boundaries during prototype learning. Our approach produces high-quality pseudo masks without pixel-level annotations, improves localization completeness, and enhances semantic consistency across tissue types. Experiments on BCSS-WSSS datasets demonstrate that our prototype learning framework outperforms existing WSSS methods while remaining computationally efficient through frozen foundation model backbones and lightweight trainable adapters.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Under review for IEEE TPAMI", "summary": "Multi-output Gaussian process (MGP) models have attracted significant attention for their flexibility and uncertainty-quantification capabilities, and have been widely adopted in multi-source transfer learning scenarios due to their ability to capture inter-task correlations. However, they still face several challenges in transfer learning. First, the input spaces of the source and target domains are often heterogeneous, which makes direct knowledge transfer difficult. Second, potential prior knowledge and physical information are typically ignored during heterogeneous transfer, hampering the utilization of domain-specific insights and leading to unstable mappings. Third, inappropriate information sharing among target and sources can easily lead to negative transfer. Traditional models fail to address these issues in a unified way. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a Double-Regularized Heterogeneous Gaussian Process framework (R^2-HGP). Specifically, a trainable prior probability mapping model is first proposed to align the heterogeneous input domains. The resulting aligned inputs are treated as latent variables, upon which a multi-source transfer GP model is constructed and the entire structure is integrated into a novel conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) based framework.

General Scene Adaptation for VLN (GSA-VLN) shifts the focus from zero-shot generalization to continual, environment-specific adaptation, narrowing the gap between static benchmarks and real-world deployment. However, current GSA-VLN frameworks exclude user feedback, relying solely on unsupervised adaptation from repeated environmental exposure. In practice, user feedback offers natural and valuable supervision that can significantly enhance adaptation quality. We introduce a user-feedback-driven adaptation framework that extends GSA-VLN by systematically integrating human interactions into continual learning. Our approach converts user feedback-navigation instructions and corrective signals-into high-quality, environment-aligned training data, enabling efficient and realistic adaptation. A memory-bank warm-start mechanism further reuses previously acquired environmental knowledge, mitigating cold-start degradation and ensuring stable redeployment. Experiments on the GSA-R2R benchmark show that our method consistently surpasses strong baselines such as GR-DUET, improving navigation success and path efficiency. The memory-bank warm start stabilizes early navigation and reduces performance drops after updates. Results under both continual and hybrid adaptation settings confirm the robustness and generality of our framework, demonstrating sustained improvement across diverse deployment conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Token reduction, while extensively explored for video-only LLMs, is insufficient for the audio-visual domain, as these unimodal methods cannot leverage audio-visual cross-modal synergies. Furthermore, the distinct and dynamic information densities of audio and video render static budgets per modality suboptimal. How to perform token reduction on a joint audio-visual stream thus remains an unaddressed bottleneck. To fill this gap, we introduce EchoingPixels, a framework inspired by the coexistence and interaction of visuals and sound in real-world scenes. The core of our framework is the Cross-Modal Semantic Sieve (CS2), a module enabling early audio-visual interaction. Instead of compressing modalities independently, CS2 co-attends to the joint multimodal stream and reduces tokens from an entire combined pool of audio-visual tokens rather than using fixed budgets per modality. This single-pool approach allows it to adaptively allocate the token budget across both modalities and dynamically identify salient tokens in concert. To ensure this aggressive reduction preserves the vital temporal modeling capability, we co-design a Synchronization-Augmented RoPE (Sync-RoPE) to maintain critical temporal relationships for the sparsely selected tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EchoingPixels achieves performance comparable to strong baselines using only 5-20% of the original tokens, with a 2-3x speedup and memory reduction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(AV-LLMs)\u9762\u4e34\u5927\u91cf\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u89c6\u9891token\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8fc7\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faEchoingPixels\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u7b5b\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u8054\u5408token\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75285-20%\u539f\u59cbtoken\u5373\u53ef\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u6bd4\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b02-3\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709token\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e14\u56fa\u5b9a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u7b97\u7b56\u7565\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u97f3\u9891\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u4fe1\u606f\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u6027\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u3002\u5982\u4f55\u5bf9\u8054\u5408\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u6d41\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u6548token\u526a\u679d\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e9f\u5f85\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u74f6\u9888\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u7b5b(CS2)\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4ece\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9token\u6c60\u4e2d\u8054\u5408\u9009\u62e9token\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u30022. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u540c\u6b65\u589e\u5f3aRoPE(Sync-RoPE)\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u9009\u62e9\u7684token\u4fdd\u6301\u5173\u952e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "EchoingPixels\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75285-20%\u539f\u59cbtoken\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e0e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u4e862-3\u500d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8054\u5408token\u526a\u679d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u534f\u540c\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u591a\u5a92\u4f53\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

Treatment selection for low to intermediate risk patients with severe aortic stenosis between surgical (SAVR) and transcatheter (TAVR) aortic valve replacement remains variable in clinical practice, driven by patient heterogeneity and institutional preferences. While existing models predict postprocedural risk, there is a lack of interpretable, individualized treatment recommendations that directly optimize long-term outcomes.\n  Methods. We introduce an interpretable prescriptive framework that integrates prognostic matching, counterfactual outcome modeling, and an Optimal Policy Tree (OPT) to recommend the treatment minimizing expected 5-year mortality. Using data from Hartford Hospital and St. Vincent's Hospital, we emulate randomization via prognostic matching and sample weighting and estimate counterfactual mortality under both SAVR and TAVR. The policy model, trained on these counterfactual predictions, partitions patients into clinically coherent subgroups and prescribes the treatment associated with lower estimated risk.\n  Findings. If the OPT prescriptions are applied, counterfactual evaluation showed an estimated reduction in 5-year mortality of 20.3\\% in Hartford and 13.8\\% in St. Vincent's relative to real-life prescriptions, showing promising generalizability to unseen data from a different institution. The learned decision boundaries aligned with real-world outcomes and clinical observations.\n  Interpretation. Our interpretable prescriptive framework is, to the best of our knowledge, the first to provide transparent, data-driven recommendations for TAVR versus SAVR that improve estimated long-term outcomes both in an internal and external cohort, while remaining clinically grounded and contributing toward a more systematic and evidence-based approach to precision medicine in structural heart disease.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u4e3b\u52a8\u8109\u74e3\u72ed\u7a84\u60a3\u8005TAVR vs SAVR\u6cbb\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5904\u65b9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1\u53ef\u964d\u4f4e5\u5e74\u6b7b\u4ea1\u738713.8-20.3%", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4f4e\u81f3\u4e2d\u5371\u91cd\u5ea6\u4e3b\u52a8\u8109\u74e3\u72ed\u7a84\u60a3\u8005\u5728SAVR\u548cTAVR\u6cbb\u7597\u9009\u62e9\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u53d8\u5f02\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u9884\u6d4b\u672f\u540e\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u957f\u671f\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e2a\u4f53\u5316\u6cbb\u7597\u63a8\u8350", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u96c6\u6210\u9884\u540e\u5339\u914d\u3001\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7ed3\u5c40\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u6811\uff08OPT\uff09\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5904\u65b9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u540e\u5339\u914d\u548c\u6837\u672c\u52a0\u6743\u6a21\u62df\u968f\u673a\u5316\uff0c\u4f30\u8ba1SAVR\u548cTAVR\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\uff0cOPT\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9884\u6d4b\u5c06\u60a3\u8005\u5206\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5e72\u4e9a\u7ec4\u5e76\u63a8\u8350\u98ce\u9669\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u6cbb\u7597", "result": "\u5e94\u7528OPT\u5904\u65b9\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e5\u5e74\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\uff08\u54c8\u7279\u798f\u5fb7\u533b\u966220.3%\uff0c\u5723\u6587\u68ee\u7279\u533b\u966213.8%\uff09\uff0c\u5b66\u5f97\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u63d0\u4f9bTAVR vs SAVR\u900f\u660e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5904\u65b9\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u53ef\u6539\u5584\u5185\u90e8\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u961f\u5217\u7684\u957f\u671f\u9884\u540e\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u5fc3\u810f\u75c5\u7cbe\u51c6\u533b\u7597\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u3001\u5faa\u8bc1\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u65b9\u6cd5"}}

A widely used approach is the ratio-of-densities method, which defines a time-indexed target path by reweighting probability-density trajectories from multiple models with positive, or in some cases, negative exponents. This construction, however, harbors a critical and previously unformalized failure mode: Marginal Path Collapse, where intermediate densities become non-normalizable even though endpoints remain valid. Collapse arises systematically when composing heterogeneous models trained on different noise schedules or datasets, including a common setting in molecular design where de-novo, conformer, and pocket-conditioned models must be combined for tasks such as flexible-pose scaffold decoration. We provide a novel and complete solution for the problem. First, we derive a simple path existence criterion that predicts exactly when collapse occurs from noise schedules and exponents alone. Second, we introduce Adaptive path Correction with Exponents (ACE), which extends Feynman-Kac steering to time-varying exponents and guarantees a valid probability path. On a synthetic 2D benchmark and on flexible-pose scaffold decoration, ACE eliminates collapse and enables high-guidance compositional generation, improving distributional and docking metrics over constant-exponent baselines and even specialized task-specific scaffold decoration models.

These models can serve as backbones for region-of-interest (ROI) image analysis or patch-level feature extractors in whole-slide images (WSIs) based on multiple instance learning (MIL). Existing pathology foundation models (PFMs) are typically pre-trained on Hematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) stained pathology images. However, images with special stains, such as immunohistochemistry, are also frequently used in clinical practice. PFMs pre-trained mainly on H\\&E-stained images may be limited in clinical applications involving special stains. To address this issue, we propose StainNet, a specialized foundation model for special stains based on the vision transformer (ViT) architecture. StainNet adopts a self-distillation SSL approach and is trained on over 1.4 million patch images cropping from 20,231 publicly available special staining WSIs in the HISTAI database. To evaluate StainNet, we conduct experiments on an in-house slide-level liver malignancy classification task and two public ROI-level datasets to demonstrate its strong ability. We also perform few-ratio learning and retrieval evaluations, and compare StainNet with recently larger PFMs to further highlight its strengths.

Federated unlearning has therefore emerged as a research frontier, aiming to remove a specific party's contribution from the learned model while preserving the utility of the remaining parties. However, most unlearning techniques focus on Horizontal Federated Learning (HFL), where data are partitioned by samples. In contrast, Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) allows organizations that possess complementary feature spaces to train a joint model without sharing raw data. The resulting feature-partitioned architecture renders HFL-oriented unlearning methods ineffective. In this paper, we propose REMISVFU, a plug-and-play representation misdirection framework that enables fast, client-level unlearning in splitVFL systems. When a deletion request arrives, the forgetting party collapses its encoder output to a randomly sampled anchor on the unit sphere, severing the statistical link between its features and the global model. To maintain utility for the remaining parties, the server jointly optimizes a retention loss and a forgetting loss, aligning their gradients via orthogonal projection to eliminate destructive interference. Evaluations on public benchmarks show that REMISVFU suppresses back-door attack success to the natural class-prior level and sacrifices only about 2.5% points of clean accuracy, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "REMISVFU\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5782\u76f4\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60(VFL)\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7ea7\u9057\u5fd8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8868\u5f81\u8bef\u5bfc\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5269\u4f59\u65b9\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6d88\u9664\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8d21\u732e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u9057\u5fd8\u6280\u672f\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u6c34\u5e73\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60(HFL)\uff0c\u800c\u5782\u76f4\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60(VFL)\u4e2d\u6570\u636e\u6309\u7279\u5f81\u5212\u5206\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u4f7f\u5f97HFL\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6548\u3002\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u62a4\u6cd5\u89c4\uff08\u5982GDPR\uff09\u8981\u6c42\u8054\u90a6\u7cfb\u7edf\u652f\u6301\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u7684\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\u6743\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9VFL\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "REMISVFU\u91c7\u7528\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u8bef\u5bfc\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u5f53\u6536\u5230\u5220\u9664\u8bf7\u6c42\u65f6\uff0c\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u5c06\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8f93\u51fa\u574d\u7f29\u5230\u5355\u4f4d\u7403\u9762\u4e0a\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u951a\u70b9\uff0c\u5207\u65ad\u5176\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7edf\u8ba1\u8054\u7cfb\u3002\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4fdd\u7559\u635f\u5931\u548c\u9057\u5fd8\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6b63\u4ea4\u6295\u5f71\u5bf9\u9f50\u68af\u5ea6\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u7834\u574f\u6027\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5f00\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cREMISVFU\u5c06\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\u6291\u5236\u5230\u81ea\u7136\u7c7b\u5148\u9a8c\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4ec5\u727a\u7272\u7ea62.5\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5782\u76f4\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7ea7\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86VFL\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u88ab\u9057\u5fd8\u6743\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Yet the geometric behavior of these agentic loops (whether they converge, diverge, or exhibit more complex dynamics) remains poorly understood. This paper introduces a geometric framework for analyzing agentic trajectories in semantic embedding space, treating iterative transformations as discrete dynamical systems.\n  We distinguish the artifact space, where linguistic transformations occur, from the embedding space, where geometric measurements are performed. Because cosine similarity is biased by embedding anisotropy, we introduce an isotonic calibration that eliminates systematic bias and aligns similarities with human semantic judgments while preserving high local stability. This enables rigorous measurement of trajectories, clusters and attractors.\n  Through controlled experiments on singular agentic loops, we identify two fundamental regimes. A contractive rewriting loop converges toward a stable attractor with decreasing dispersion, while an exploratory summarize and negate loop produces unbounded divergence with no cluster formation. These regimes display qualitatively distinct geometric signatures of contraction and expansion.\n  Our results show that prompt design directly governs the dynamical regime of an agentic loop, enabling systematic control of convergence, divergence and trajectory structure in iterative LLM transformations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c6\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u52a8\u6001\uff08\u6536\u655b\u3001\u53d1\u6563\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u6d88\u9664\u5d4c\u5165\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u533a\u5206\u51fa\u538b\u7f29\u91cd\u5199\u4e0e\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u603b\u7ed3\u8fd9\u4e24\u7c7b\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u8fc7\u9012\u5f52\u53cd\u9988\u5faa\u73af\uff08\u5373\u524d\u4e00\u8f6e\u8f93\u51fa\u4f5c\u4e3a\u540e\u4e00\u8f6e\u8f93\u5165\uff09\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u51e0\u4f55\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u6536\u655b\u3001\u53d1\u6563\u7b49\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff09\u5374\u9c9c\u5c11\u88ab\u4e25\u683c\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5faa\u73af\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u6f14\u5316\u3002", "method": "1. \u533a\u5206\u4e86\u53d1\u751f\u8bed\u8a00\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u201c\u5236\u54c1\u7a7a\u95f4\u201d\u548c\u8fdb\u884c\u51e0\u4f55\u6d4b\u91cf\u7684\u201c\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u201d\uff1b2. \u9488\u5bf9\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u5404\u5411\u5f02\u6027\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u6821\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u6d88\u9664\u7cfb\u7edf\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4f7f\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8bed\u4e49\u5224\u65ad\u5bf9\u9f50\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u5c40\u90e8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1b3. \u5728\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u53d7\u63a7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u4e24\u7c7b\u57fa\u672c\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u538b\u7f29\u91cd\u5199\u73af\u4e0e\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u603b\u7ed3\u5426\u5b9a\u73af\uff09\u3002", "result": "1. \u538b\u7f29\u91cd\u5199\u73af\u4f1a\u6536\u655b\u81f3\u4e00\u4e2a\u7a33\u5b9a\u5438\u5f15\u5b50\uff0c\u4e14\u5206\u6563\u5ea6\u9012\u51cf\uff1b2. \u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u603b\u7ed3\u4e0e\u5426\u5b9a\u73af\u5219\u4ea7\u751f\u65e0\u754c\u53d1\u6563\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u5f62\u6210\u805a\u7c7b\uff1b3. \u4e24\u7c7b\u673a\u5236\u5206\u522b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u51e0\u4f55\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u6536\u7f29\u4e0e\u6269\u5f20\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u76f4\u63a5\u4e3b\u5bfc\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5faa\u73af\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6765\u63a7\u5236LLM\u8fed\u4ee3\u8f6c\u6362\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6536\u655b\u3001\u53d1\u6563\u53ca\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ed3\u6784\u3002"}}

Such an assumption oversimplifies the problem, as a good model must preserve the uniqueness of emerging items while leveraging their shared patterns with established ones. To address this challenge, we propose EmerFlow, a novel LLM-empowered representation learning framework that generates distinctive embeddings for emerging items. It first enriches the raw features of emerging items through LLM reasoning, then aligns these representations with the embedding space of the existing recommendation model. Finally, new interactions are incorporated through meta-learning to refine the embeddings. This enables EmerFlow to learn expressive embeddings for emerging items from only limited interactions. Extensive experiments across diverse domains, including movies and pharmaceuticals, show that EmerFlow consistently outperforms existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address the data shortage problem, we propose a conditional generative framework based on the Pix2Pix architecture to generate realistic filaments in microscopy images from binary masks.

However, building agents for these tasks faces a critical bottleneck: the reliance on ever-expanding interaction history incurs substantial context overhead.

We propose AgentProg, a program-guided approach for agent context management that reframes the interaction history as a program with variables and control flow. By organizing information according to the structure of program, this structure provides a principled mechanism to determine which information should be retained and which can be discarded. We further integrate a global belief state mechanism inspired by Belief MDP framework to handle partial observability and adapt to unexpected environmental changes. Experiments on AndroidWorld and our extended long-horizon task suite demonstrate that AgentProg has achieved the state-of-the-art success rates on these benchmarks.

Considering existing RL- based finetuning methods, entropy intervention turns out to be an effective way to benefit exploratory ability, thereby improving policy performance. Notably, most existing stud- ies intervene in entropy by simply controlling the update of specific tokens during policy optimization of RL. They ig- nore the entropy intervention during the RL sampling that can boost the performance of GRPO by improving the di- versity of responses. In this paper, we propose Selective- adversarial Entropy Intervention, namely SaEI, which en- hances policy entropy by distorting the visual input with the token-selective adversarial objective coming from the en- tropy of sampled responses. Specifically, we first propose entropy-guided adversarial sampling (EgAS) that formu- lates the entropy of sampled responses as an adversarial ob- jective. Then, the corresponding adversarial gradient can be used to attack the visual input for producing adversarial samples, allowing the policy model to explore a larger an- swer space during RL sampling. Then, we propose token- selective entropy computation (TsEC) to maximize the ef- fectiveness of adversarial attack in EgAS without distorting factual knowledge within VLMs. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets show that our proposed method can greatly improve policy exploration via entropy intervention, to boost reasoning capabilities.

Additionally, practical sequential planning often involves non-optimal (erroneous) steps, challenging VLMs to detect and correct such steps. We propose Corrective Sequential Planning Benchmark (CoSPlan) to evaluate VLMs in error-prone, vision-based sequential planning tasks across 4 domains: maze navigation, block rearrangement, image reconstruction,and object reorganization. CoSPlan assesses two key abilities: Error Detection (identifying non-optimal action) and Step Completion (correcting and completing action sequences to reach the goal). Despite using state-of-the-art reasoning techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and Scene Graphs, VLMs (e.g. Intern-VLM and Qwen2) struggle on CoSPlan, failing to leverage contextual cues to reach goals. Addressing this, we propose a novel training-free method, Scene Graph Incremental updates (SGI), which introduces intermediate reasoning steps between the initial and goal states. SGI helps VLMs reason about sequences, yielding an average performance gain of 5.2%. In addition to enhancing reliability in corrective sequential planning, SGI generalizes to traditional planning tasks such as Plan-Bench and VQA.", "AI": {"tldr": "CoSPlan\u57fa\u51c6\u8bc4\u4f30VLMs\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u987a\u5e8f\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0e\u7ea0\u6b63\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684SGI\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u987a\u5e8f\u89c4\u5212\u2014\u2014\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5904\u7406\u5305\u542b\u975e\u6700\u4f18\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u65b9\u9762\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u5f53\u89c4\u5212\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u6b65\u9aa4\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u80fd\u591f\u68c0\u6d4b\u5e76\u7ea0\u6b63\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CoSPlan\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u8ff7\u5bab\u5bfc\u822a\u3001\u79ef\u6728\u91cd\u6392\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u7269\u4f53\u91cd\u7ec44\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u9519\u8bef\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6b65\u9aa4\u5b8c\u6210\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709VLMs\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u2014\u2014\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u589e\u91cf\u66f4\u65b0(SGI)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u72b6\u6001\u4e4b\u95f4\u5f15\u5165\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u6765\u5e2e\u52a9\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8fdb\u884c\u987a\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6280\u672f(\u5982Chain-of-Thought\u548cScene Graphs)\u7684VLMs\u5728CoSPlan\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ebf\u7d22\u8fbe\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u800cSGI\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u57475.2%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u7ea0\u6b63\u6027\u987a\u5e8f\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u5982Plan-Bench\u548cVQA\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u987a\u5e8f\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5305\u542b\u9519\u8bef\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684SGI\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u6709\u6548\u6539\u5584\u4e86VLMs\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

This formulation is the foundation of most algebraic and computational approaches to graph processing. The advent of deep learning language models offers a wide range of powerful computational models that are specialized in the processing of text. However, current procedures to represent graphs are not amenable to processing by these models. In this work, a new method to represent graphs is proposed. It represents the adjacency matrix of a graph by a string of simple instructions. The instructions build the adjacency matrix step by step.

While recent methods achieve impressive results, most rely on fixed skeletal templates, which prevent them from generalizing to skeletons with different or perturbed topologies. We address the core limitation of current motion generation methods - the combined lack of large-scale heterogeneous animal motion data and unified generative frameworks capable of jointly modeling arbitrary skeletal topologies and textual conditions. To this end, we introduce OmniZoo, a large-scale animal motion dataset spanning 140 species and 32,979 sequences, enriched with multimodal annotations. Building on OmniZoo, we propose a generalized autoregressive motion generation framework capable of producing text-driven motions for arbitrary skeletal topologies. Central to our model is a Topology-aware Skeleton Embedding Module that encodes geometric and structural properties of any skeleton into a shared token space, enabling seamless fusion with textual semantics. Given a text prompt and a target skeleton, our method generates temporally coherent, physically plausible, and semantically aligned motions, and further enables cross-species motion style transfer.", "AI": {"tldr": "OmniZoo\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6587\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u610f\u9aa8\u9abc\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u52a8\u7269\u8fd0\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u7269\u79cd\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u9aa8\u9abc\u6a21\u677f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u6216\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9aa8\u9abc\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5f02\u6784\u52a8\u7269\u8fd0\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8de8\u7269\u79cd\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86OmniZoo\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u52a8\u7269\u8fd0\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08140\u4e2a\u7269\u79cd\uff0c32,979\u4e2a\u5e8f\u5217\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u7528\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u662f\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u9aa8\u9abc\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5c06\u4efb\u610f\u9aa8\u9abc\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\u7f16\u7801\u5230\u5171\u4eab\u6807\u8bb0\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u9aa8\u9abc\u751f\u6210\u65f6\u7a7a\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u4e14\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8de8\u7269\u79cd\u8fd0\u52a8\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u7a81\u7834\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9aa8\u9abc\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u7684\u9650\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "OmniZoo\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u548c\u62d3\u6251\u611f\u77e5\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e3a\u4efb\u610f\u9aa8\u9abc\u62d3\u6251\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u6587\u672c\u9a71\u52a8\u8fd0\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u52a8\u753b\u548c\u865a\u62df\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Despite significant empirical advancements in backdoor research, the lack of rigorous theoretical analysis limits understanding of underlying mechanisms, constraining attack predictability and adaptability. Therefore, we provide a theoretical analysis targeting backdoor attacks, focusing on how sparse decision boundaries enable disproportionate model manipulation. Based on this finding, we derive a closed-form, ambiguous boundary region, wherein negligible relabeled samples induce substantial misclassification. Influence function analysis further quantifies significant parameter shifts caused by these margin samples, with minimal impact on clean accuracy, formally grounding why such low poison rates suffice for efficacious attacks. Leveraging these insights, we propose Eminence, an explainable and robust black-box backdoor framework with provable theoretical guarantees and inherent stealth properties. Eminence optimizes a universal, visually subtle trigger that strategically exploits vulnerable decision boundaries and effectively achieves robust misclassification with exceptionally low poison rates (< 0.1%, compared to SOTA methods typically requiring > 1%). Comprehensive experiments validate our theoretical discussions and demonstrate the effectiveness of Eminence, confirming an exponential relationship between margin poisoning and adversarial boundary manipulation. Eminence maintains > 90% attack success rate, exhibits negligible clean-accuracy loss, and demonstrates high transferability across diverse models, datasets and scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing approaches often rely on 2D encoders that neglect the inherent volumetric nature of the data. We propose TranSamba, a hybrid Transformer-Mamba architecture designed to capture 3D context for weakly supervised volumetric medical segmentation. TranSamba augments a standard Vision Transformer backbone with Cross-Plane Mamba blocks, which leverage the linear complexity of state space models for efficient information exchange across neighboring slices. The information exchange enhances the pairwise self-attention within slices computed by the Transformer blocks, directly contributing to the attention maps for object localization.

We present mmCounter, which accurately counts static people in dense indoor spaces (up to three people per square meter). mmCounter achieves this by extracting ultra-low frequency (< 1 Hz) signals, primarily from breathing and micro-scale body movements such as slight torso shifts, and applying novel signal processing techniques to differentiate these subtle signals from background noise and nearby static objects. Our problem differs significantly from existing studies on breathing rate estimation, which assume the number of people is known a priori. In contrast, mmCounter utilizes a novel multi-stage signal processing pipeline to extract relevant low-frequency sources along with their spatial information and map these sources to individual people, enabling accurate counting. Extensive evaluations in various environments demonstrate that mmCounter delivers an 87% average F1 score and 0.6 mean absolute error in familiar environments, and a 60% average F1 score and 1.1 mean absolute error in previously untested environments.

Do models truly know what they know? Drawing from human cognitive science, we propose a new framework for evaluating and leveraging AI metacognition. We introduce meta-d', a psychologically-grounded measure of metacognitive sensitivity, to characterise how reliably a model's confidence predicts its own accuracy. We then use this dynamic sensitivity score as context for a bandit-based arbiter that performs test-time model selection, learning which of several expert models to trust for a given task. Our experiments across multiple datasets and deep learning model combinations (including CNNs and VLMs) demonstrate that this metacognitive approach improves joint-inference accuracy over constituent models. This work provides a novel behavioural account of AI models, recasting ensemble selection as a problem of evaluating both short-term signals (confidence prediction scores) and medium-term traits (metacognitive sensitivity).", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our system pairs an Actor agent with a Critic agent, enabling an iterative workflow where the system autonomously reasons over tool parameters and refines configurations to progressively align with human design preferences. We validate this approach on the generation of various 3D maps, establishing a new benchmark for instruction-following in PCG. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms single-agent baselines, producing diverse and structurally valid environments from natural language descriptions.

This study introduces a novel Robust Hybrid Physics-ML framework employing Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for highly accurate, uncertainty-aware Jw prediction. The core innovation lies in training the GPR on the residual error between the detailed, non-linear FO physical model prediction (Jw_physical) and the experimental water flux (Jw_actual).

However, due to weak heuristics for auxiliary constructions, AI for geometry problem solving remains dominated by expert models such as AlphaGeometry 2, which rely heavily on large-scale data synthesis and search for both training and evaluation. In this work, we make the first attempt to build a medalist-level LLM agent for geometry and present InternGeometry. InternGeometry overcomes the heuristic limitations in geometry by iteratively proposing propositions and auxiliary constructions, verifying them with a symbolic engine, and reflecting on the engine's feedback to guide subsequent proposals. A dynamic memory mechanism enables InternGeometry to conduct more than two hundred interactions with the symbolic engine per problem. To further accelerate learning, we introduce Complexity-Boosting Reinforcement Learning (CBRL), which gradually increases the complexity of synthesized problems across training stages. Built on InternThinker-32B, InternGeometry solves 44 of 50 IMO geometry problems (2000-2024), exceeding the average gold medalist score (40.9), using only 13K training examples, just 0.004% of the data used by AlphaGeometry 2, demonstrating the potential of LLM agents on expert-level geometry tasks.

While methods that crop salient regions of an image offer a partial solution, we identify a critical limitation they introduce: \"Contextual Blindness\". This failure occurs due to structural disconnect between high-fidelity details (from the crop) and the broader global context (from the original image), even when all necessary visual information is present. We argue that this limitation stems not from a lack of information 'Quantity', but from a lack of 'Structural Diversity' in the model's input. To resolve this, we propose Visual Funnel, a training-free, two-step approach. Visual Funnel first performs Contextual Anchoring to identify the region of interest in a single forward pass. It then constructs an Entropy-Scaled Portfolio that preserves the hierarchical context - ranging from focal detail to broader surroundings - by dynamically determining crop sizes based on attention entropy and refining crop centers. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that Visual Funnel significantly outperforms naive single-crop and unstructured multi-crop baselines. Our results further validate that simply adding more unstructured crops provides limited or even detrimental benefits, confirming that the hierarchical structure of our portfolio is key to resolving Contextual Blindness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aVisual Funnel\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u6b65\u5f0f\u7ed3\u6784\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684'\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f2\u533a'\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u6bd4\u5355\u88c1\u5207\u548c\u591a\u88c1\u5207\u57fa\u7ebf\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u7ec6\u8282\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u88c1\u5207\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u83b7\u53d6\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4'\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f2\u533a'\u2014\u2014\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7ec6\u8282\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u65ad\u5f00\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6240\u6709\u5fc5\u8981\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u90fd\u5b58\u5728", "method": "1) \u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u951a\u5b9a\uff1a\u5355\u6b21\u524d\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u8bc6\u522b\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u533a\u57df\uff1b2) \u6784\u5efa\u71b5\u7f29\u653e\u7ec4\u5408\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u71b5\u52a8\u6001\u786e\u5b9a\u88c1\u5207\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u88c1\u5207\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u4ece\u7126\u70b9\u7ec6\u8282\u5230\u5468\u56f4\u73af\u5883\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ed3\u6784", "result": "\u4e0e\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5355\u88c1\u5207\u548c\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u591a\u88c1\u5207\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cVisual Funnel\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u8d8a\uff1b\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u591a\u88c1\u5207\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u751a\u81f3\u6709\u5bb3\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7ec4\u5408\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f2\u533a\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981", "conclusion": "Visual Funnel\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MLLM\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f2\u533a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u591a\u6837\u6027\u800c\u975e\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u662f\u63d0\u5347\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u89c6\u89c9\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5173\u952e"}}

However, existing constraint satisfaction methods face efficiency-applicability trade-offs, with hard constraint methods suffering from either high computational complexity or restrictive assumptions on constraint structures. The Sampling Kaczmarz-Motzkin (SKM) method is a randomized iterative algorithm for solving large-scale linear inequality systems with favorable convergence properties, but its argmax operations introduce non-differentiability, posing challenges for neural network applications. This work proposes the Trainable Sampling Kaczmarz-Motzkin Network (T-SKM-Net) framework and, for the first time, systematically integrates SKM-type methods into neural network constraint satisfaction. The framework transforms mixed constraint problems into pure inequality problems through null space transformation, employs SKM for iterative solving, and maps solutions back to the original constraint space, efficiently handling both equality and inequality constraints. We provide theoretical proof of post-processing effectiveness in expectation and end-to-end trainability guarantees based on unbiased gradient estimators, demonstrating that despite non-differentiable operations, the framework supports standard backpropagation. On the DCOPF case118 benchmark, our method achieves 4.27ms/item GPU serial forward inference with 0.0025% max optimality gap with post-processing mode and 5.25ms/item with 0.0008% max optimality gap with joint training mode, delivering over 25$\\times$ speedup compared to the pandapower solver while maintaining zero constraint violations under given tolerance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

NormCode enforces a strict separation between semantic operations (LLMdriven reasoning, nondeterministic) and syntactic operations (deterministic data restructuring), enabling precise cost and reliability tracing.

The core technical challenge of LVMR stems from the computational infeasibility of processing entire lengthy videos in a single pass. This limitation has established a 'Search-then-Refine' approach, where candidates are rapidly narrowed down, and only those portions are analyzed, as the dominant paradigm for LVMR. However, existing approaches to this paradigm face severe limitations. Conventional supervised learning suffers from limited scalability and poor generalization, despite substantial resource consumption. Yet, existing zero-shot methods also fail, facing a dual challenge: (1) their heuristic strategies cause a 'search' phase candidate explosion, and (2) the 'refine' phase, which is vulnerable to semantic discrepancy, requires high-cost VLMs for verification, incurring significant computational overhead. We propose \\textbf{P}oint-\\textbf{to}-\\textbf{S}pan (P2S), a novel training-free framework to overcome this challenge of inefficient 'search' and costly 'refine' phases.

Within this paradigm, agent training is typically formulated as a zero-sum Markov game between a protagonist and an adversary to enhance policy robustness. However, the trainable nature of the adversary inevitably induces non-stationarity in the learning dynamics, leading to exacerbated training instability and convergence difficulties, particularly in high-dimensional complex environments. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Uncertainty-Aware Critic Ensemble for robust adversarial Reinforcement learning (UACER), which consists of two strategies: 1) Diversified critic ensemble: a diverse set of K critic networks is exploited in parallel to stabilize Q-value estimation rather than conventional single-critic architectures for both variance reduction and robustness enhancement. 2) Time-varying Decay Uncertainty (TDU) mechanism: advancing beyond simple linear combinations, we develop a variance-derived Q-value aggregation strategy that explicitly incorporates epistemic uncertainty to dynamically regulate the exploration-exploitation trade-off while simultaneously stabilizing the training process.

However, its performance heavily relies on dense, high-quality input imagery, an assumption that is often violated in real-world applications, where data is typically sparse and motion-blurred. These two issues create a vicious cycle: sparse views ignore the multi-view constraints necessary to resolve motion blur, while motion blur erases high-frequency details crucial for aligning the limited views. Thus, reconstruction often fails catastrophically, with fragmented views and a low-frequency bias. To break this cycle, we introduce CoherentGS, a novel framework for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from sparse and blurry images. Our key insight is to address these compound degradations using a dual-prior strategy. Specifically, we combine two pre-trained generative models: a specialized deblurring network for restoring sharp details and providing photometric guidance, and a diffusion model that offers geometric priors to fill in unobserved regions of the scene. This dual-prior strategy is supported by several key techniques, including a consistency-guided camera exploration module that adaptively guides the generative process, and a depth regularization loss that ensures geometric plausibility. We evaluate CoherentGS through both quantitative and qualitative experiments on synthetic and real-world scenes, using as few as 3, 6, and 9 input views. Our results demonstrate that CoherentGS significantly outperforms existing methods, setting a new state-of-the-art for this challenging task.

To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Replay Buffer (ARB), a novel approach that dynamically prioritizes data sampling based on a lightweight metric we call 'on-policyness'. Unlike prior methods that rely on complex learning procedures or fixed ratios, ARB is designed to be learning-free and simple to implement, seamlessly integrating into existing O2O RL algorithms. It assesses how closely collected trajectories align with the current policy's behavior and assigns a proportional sampling weight to each transition within that trajectory. This strategy effectively leverages offline data for initial stability while progressively focusing learning on the most relevant, high-rewarding online experiences.

Specifically, we introduce two contrastive distribution alignment components that reveal reliable intrinsic cellular structures by effectively exploiting cell-cell structural relationships. Additionally, we develop a refinement module that integrates gene-correlation structure learning to enhance cell embeddings by capturing underlying cell-gene associations. This module strengthens connections between cells and their associated genes, refining the representation learning to exploiting biologically meaningful relationships. Extensive experiments on several single-cell RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in cell-type identification accuracy.

However, radar inputs pose challenges due to noise, low resolution, and sparsity. Moreover, there is currently no dataset that combines LiDAR and radar data specifically for scene flow estimation. To address this gap, we construct a Radar-LiDAR scene flow dataset based on a public real-world automotive dataset. We propose an effective preprocessing strategy for radar denoising and scene flow label generation, deriving more reliable flow ground truth for radar points out of the object boundaries. Additionally, we introduce RaLiFlow, the first joint scene flow learning framework for 4D radar and LiDAR, which achieves effective radar-LiDAR fusion through a novel Dynamic-aware Bidirectional Cross-modal Fusion (DBCF) module and a carefully designed set of loss functions. The DBCF module integrates dynamic cues from radar into the local cross-attention mechanism, enabling the propagation of contextual information across modalities. Meanwhile, the proposed loss functions mitigate the adverse effects of unreliable radar data during training and enhance the instance-level consistency in scene flow predictions from both modalities, particularly for dynamic foreground areas.

Existing inference-time mitigation methods typically manipulate classifier-free guidance (CFG) or perturb prompt embeddings; however, they often struggle to reduce memorization without compromising alignment with the conditioning prompt. We introduce CAPTAIN, a training-free framework that mitigates memorization by directly modifying latent features during denoising. CAPTAIN first applies frequency-based noise initialization to reduce the tendency to replicate memorized patterns early in the denoising process. It then identifies the optimal denoising timesteps for feature injection and localizes memorized regions. Finally, CAPTAIN injects semantically aligned features from non-memorized reference images into localized latent regions, suppressing memorization while preserving prompt fidelity and visual quality. Our experiments show that CAPTAIN achieves substantial reductions in memorization compared to CFG-based baselines while maintaining strong alignment with the intended prompt.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CAPTAIN\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u6539\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u590d\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u7684\u826f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u80fd\u4f1a\u65e0\u610f\u4e2d\u590d\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u7248\u6743\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u60a3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "CAPTAIN\u91c7\u7528\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u7387\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff1b2\uff09\u8bc6\u522b\u6700\u4f73\u53bb\u566a\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u8fdb\u884c\u7279\u5f81\u6ce8\u5165\uff1b3\uff09\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8bb0\u5fc6\u533a\u57df\uff1b4\uff09\u4ece\u975e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u53c2\u8003\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eCAPTAIN\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8eCFG\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u8bb0\u5fc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4e0e\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u7684\u5f3a\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "conclusion": "CAPTAIN\u6709\u6548\u5730\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u590d\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u4fdd\u6301\u63d0\u793a\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, existing posterior sampling and MAP estimation methods often rely on modeling approximations and can be computationally demanding. In this work, we propose the variational mode-seeking loss (VML), which, when minimized during each reverse diffusion step, guides the generated sample towards the MAP estimate. VML arises from a novel perspective of minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the diffusion posterior $p(\\mathbf{x}_0|\\mathbf{x}_t)$ and the measurement posterior $p(\\mathbf{x}_0|\\mathbf{y})$, where $\\mathbf{y}$ denotes the measurement. Importantly, for linear inverse problems, VML can be analytically derived and need not be approximated. Based on further theoretical insights, we propose VML-MAP, an empirically effective algorithm for solving inverse problems, and validate its efficacy over existing methods in both performance and computational time, through extensive experiments on diverse image-restoration tasks across multiple datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Using naturalistic value elicitation grounded in the prevalent Schwartz's Theory of Basic Human Values, we constructed multi-agent simulations where communities with varying numbers of agents engaged in open-ended interactions and constitution formation. The results show that value diversity enhances value stability, fosters emergent behaviors, and brings more creative principles developed by the agents themselves without external guidance.

By incorporating intermediate exit branches into the architecture, they provide less computation for simpler samples, which is particularly beneficial for resource-constrained devices where energy consumption is crucial. However, designing early-exit networks is a challenging and time-consuming process due to the need to balance efficiency and performance. Recent works have utilized Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to design more efficient early-exit networks, aiming to reduce average latency while improving model accuracy by determining the best positions and number of exit branches in the architecture. Another important factor affecting the efficiency and accuracy of early-exit networks is the depth and types of layers in the exit branches. In this paper, we use hardware-aware NAS to strengthen exit branches, considering both accuracy and efficiency during optimization. Our performance evaluation on the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN datasets demonstrates that our proposed framework, which considers varying depths and layers for exit branches along with adaptive threshold tuning, designs early-exit networks that achieve higher accuracy with the same or lower average number of MACs compared to the state-of-the-art approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, LiDAR-based point cloud acquisition is often affected by various disturbances, resulting in a large number of noise points that degrade the accuracy of subsequent point cloud object detection and recognition. Moreover, existing point cloud denoising methods typically sacrifice computational efficiency in pursuit of higher denoising accuracy, or, conversely, improve processing speed at the expense of preserving object boundaries and fine structural details, making it difficult to simultaneously achieve high denoising accuracy, strong edge preservation, and real-time performance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an adaptive dual-weight gravitational-based point cloud denoising method. First, an octree is employed to perform spatial partitioning of the global point cloud, enabling parallel acceleration. Then, within each leaf node, adaptive voxel-based occupancy statistics and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) density estimation are applied to rapidly remove clearly isolated and low-density noise points, thereby reducing the effective candidate set. Finally, a gravitational scoring function that combines density weights with adaptive distance weights is constructed to finely distinguish noise points from object points. Experiments conducted on the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository, the Canadian Adverse Driving Conditions (CADC) dataset, and in-house FMCW LiDAR point clouds acquired in our laboratory demonstrate that, compared with existing methods, the proposed approach achieves consistent improvements in F1, PSNR, and Chamfer Distance (CD) across various noise conditions while reducing the single-frame processing time, thereby validating its high accuracy, robustness, and real-time performance in multi-noise scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u53cc\u6743\u91cd\u91cd\u529b\u70b9\u4e91\u53bb\u566a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e76\u884c\u52a0\u901f\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u566a\u58f0\u7b5b\u9664\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u53bb\u566a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u5e38\u53d7\u591a\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u800c\u5f53\u524d\u53bb\u566a\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u6ee1\u8db3\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u5f3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u4fdd\u6301\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u57fa\u4e8e\u516b\u53c9\u6811\u5b9e\u73b0\u5168\u5c40\u70b9\u4e91\u7a7a\u95f4\u5212\u5206\u4ee5\u5e76\u884c\u52a0\u901f\uff1b\u5728\u53f6\u8282\u70b9\u5185\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f53\u7d20\u5360\u7528\u7edf\u8ba1\u548ckNN\u5bc6\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5feb\u901f\u53bb\u9664\u660e\u663e\u566a\u58f0\uff1b\u6700\u540e\u7ed3\u5408\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8ddd\u79bb\u6743\u91cd\u7684\u91cd\u529b\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\u7ec6\u81f4\u533a\u5206\u566a\u58f0\u70b9\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u65af\u5766\u798f3D\u626b\u63cf\u5e93\u3001CADC\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4FMCW\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u70b9\u4e91\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0bF1\u3001PSNR\u548c\u5012\u89d2\u8ddd\u79bb\u6307\u6807\u5747\u6709\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5355\u5e27\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u566a\u58f0\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u548c\u4e09\u7ef4\u91cd\u5efa\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, its strong reliance on accurate labels makes it inherently vulnerable to label noise, prevalent in real-world scenarios, resulting in significant performance degradation and overfitting. To address this issue, we propose LaT-IB, a novel Label-Noise ResistanT Information Bottleneck method which introduces a \"Minimal-Sufficient-Clean\" (MSC) criterion. Instantiated as a mutual information regularizer to retain task-relevant information while discarding noise, MSC addresses standard IB's vulnerability to noisy label supervision. To achieve this, LaT-IB employs a noise-aware latent disentanglement that decomposes the latent representation into components aligned with to the clean label space and the noise space. Theoretically, we first derive mutual information bounds for each component of our objective including prediction, compression, and disentanglement, and moreover prove that optimizing it encourages representations invariant to input noise and separates clean and noisy label information. Furthermore, we design a three-phase training framework: Warmup, Knowledge Injection and Robust Training, to progressively guide the model toward noise-resistant representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LaT-IB achieves superior robustness and efficiency under label noise, significantly enhancing robustness and applicability in real-world scenarios with label noise.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, millions use LLMs for personal advice on high-stakes topics like finance and health, where harms are context-dependent rather than universal. While frameworks like the OECD's AI classification recognize the need to assess individual risks, user-welfare safety evaluations remain underdeveloped. We argue that developing such evaluations is non-trivial due to fundamental questions about accounting for user context in evaluation design. In this exploratory study, we evaluated advice on finance and health from GPT-5, Claude Sonnet 4, and Gemini 2.5 Pro across user profiles of varying vulnerability. First, we demonstrate that evaluators must have access to rich user context: identical LLM responses were rated significantly safer by context-blind evaluators than by those aware of user circumstances, with safety scores for high-vulnerability users dropping from safe (5/7) to somewhat unsafe (3/7). One might assume this gap could be addressed by creating realistic user prompts containing key contextual information. However, our second study challenges this: we rerun the evaluation on prompts containing context users report they would disclose, finding no significant improvement. Our work establishes that effective user-welfare safety evaluation requires evaluators to assess responses against diverse user profiles, as realistic user context disclosure alone proves insufficient, particularly for vulnerable populations. By demonstrating a methodology for context-aware evaluation, this study provides both a starting point for such assessments and foundational evidence that evaluating individual welfare demands approaches distinct from existing universal-risk frameworks.

Existing research primarily focuses on video-level classification, leaving the practically crucial task of temporal localisation, identifying when hateful segments occur, largely unaddressed. This challenge is even more noticeable under weak supervision, where only video-level labels are available, and static fusion or classification-based architectures struggle to capture cross-modal and temporal dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose MultiHateLoc, the first framework designed for weakly-supervised multimodal hate localisation. MultiHateLoc incorporates (1) modality-aware temporal encoders to model heterogeneous sequential patterns, including a tailored text-based preprocessing module for feature enhancement; (2) dynamic cross-modal fusion to adaptively emphasise the most informative modality at each moment and a cross-modal contrastive alignment strategy to enhance multimodal feature consistency; (3) a modality-aware MIL objective to identify discriminative segments under video-level supervision.

We propose THeGAU, a model-agnostic framework that combines a type-aware graph autoencoder with guided graph augmentation to improve node classification. THeGAU reconstructs schema-valid edges as an auxiliary task to preserve node-type semantics and introduces a decoder-driven augmentation mechanism to selectively refine noisy structures. This joint design enhances robustness, accuracy, and efficiency while significantly reducing computational overhead.

However, many medical VLMs rely solely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which optimizes next-token prediction without evaluating answer quality. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) can incorporate task-specific feedback, and its combination with explicit intermediate reasoning (\"thinking\") has demonstrated substantial gains on verifiable math and coding tasks. To investigate the effects of RL and thinking in a CXR VLM, we perform large-scale SFT on CXR data to build an updated RadVLM based on Qwen3-VL, followed by a cold-start SFT stage that equips the model with basic thinking ability. We then apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with clinically grounded, task-specific rewards for report generation and visual grounding, and run matched RL experiments on both domain-specific and general-domain Qwen3-VL variants, with and without thinking. Across these settings, we find that while strong SFT remains crucial for high base performance, RL provides additional gains on both tasks, whereas explicit thinking does not appear to further improve results. Under a unified evaluation pipeline, the RL-optimized RadVLM models outperform their baseline counterparts and reach state-of-the-art performance on both report generation and grounding, highlighting clinically aligned RL as a powerful complement to SFT for medical VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u8865\u5145\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u663e\u5f0f\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u601d\u8003\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u672a\u5e26\u6765\u989d\u5916\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u4f18\u5316\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2atoken\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7b54\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u800c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u7ed3\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u7f16\u7a0b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7ed3\u5408\u663e\u5f0f\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u5df2\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "\u5728CXR\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8eQwen3-VL\u7684RadVLM\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u9636\u6bb5\u8d4b\u4e88\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u672c\u601d\u8003\u80fd\u529b\uff1b\u5e94\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e34\u5e8a\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u5956\u52b1\u7684GRPO\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fdb\u884c\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff1b\u5728\u6709\u65e0\u601d\u8003\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5339\u914d\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5f3a\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u5bf9\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u57fa\u5ea7\u6a21\u578b\u5f88\u5173\u952e\uff1b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u663e\u5f0f\u601d\u8003\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u672a\u5e26\u6765\u989d\u5916\u6539\u8fdb\uff1b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u7684RadVLM\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u62a5\u544a\u751f\u6210\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e34\u5e8a\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u6709\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6709\u529b\u8865\u5145\uff1b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u5f0f\u601d\u8003\u80fd\u529b\u53ef\u80fd\u975e\u5fc5\u8981\uff1b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u80f8\u90e8X\u5149\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

The first contribution addresses constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) under the average-cost criterion through the Average-Constrained Policy Optimization (ACPO) algorithm. ACPO integrates sensitivity analysis with trust-region updates to ensure stable constraint handling, achieving state-of-the-art empirical performance with theoretical guarantees. Constrained RL is then extended to finite-horizon settings via e-COP, the first policy optimization method for episodic CMDPs. Built on an episodic policy difference lemma, e-COP offers provable performance, simplicity, and scalability in safety-critical environments. The thesis then investigates reinforcement learning from human preferences. warmPref-PS introduces a posterior sampling strategy for linear bandits that integrates offline preference data from heterogeneous raters into online learning. Explicit modeling of rater competence yields substantial regret reduction and more efficient data collection for RLHF. The PSPL algorithm further advances preference-based RL by jointly sampling reward models and transition dynamics from pairwise trajectory comparisons, providing Bayesian simple-regret guarantees and robust empirical identification of optimal policies. The final contribution applies these methods to large-scale model alignment. A multi-objective constrained optimization view yields MOPO, an iterative algorithm with closed-form updates that scales to multi-billion-parameter language models and remains robust across alignment settings.

To bridge the gap between static storage and dynamic reasoning, we propose $\\textbf{ReMe}$ ($\\textit{Remember Me, Refine Me}$), a comprehensive framework for experience-driven agent evolution. ReMe innovates across the memory lifecycle via three mechanisms: 1) $\\textit{multi-faceted distillation}$, which extracts fine-grained experiences by recognizing success patterns, analyzing failure triggers and generating comparative insights; 2) $\\textit{context-adaptive reuse}$, which tailors historical insights to new contexts via scenario-aware indexing; and 3) $\\textit{utility-based refinement}$, which autonomously adds valid memories and prunes outdated ones to maintain a compact, high-quality experience pool. Extensive experiments on BFCL-V3 and AppWorld demonstrate that ReMe establishes a new state-of-the-art in agent memory system. Crucially, we observe a significant memory-scaling effect: Qwen3-8B equipped with ReMe outperforms larger, memoryless Qwen3-14B, suggesting that self-evolving memory provides a computation-efficient pathway for lifelong learning.

While quantization techniques have successfully reduced resource requirements in standard deep learning models, their application to probabilistic models remains largely unexplored. We introduce a systematic multi-level quantization framework for Stochastic Variational Inference based BNNs that distinguishes between three quantization strategies: Variational Parameter Quantization (VPQ), Sampled Parameter Quantization (SPQ), and Joint Quantization (JQ). Our logarithmic quantization for variance parameters, and specialized activation functions to preserve the distributional structure are essential for calibrated uncertainty estimation. Through comprehensive experiments on Dirty-MNIST, we demonstrate that BNNs can be quantized down to 4-bit precision while maintaining both classification accuracy and uncertainty disentanglement. At 4 bits, Joint Quantization achieves up to 8x memory reduction compared to floating-point implementations with minimal degradation in epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimation. These results enable deployment of BNNs on resource-constrained edge devices and provide design guidelines for future analog \"Bayesian Machines\" operating at inherently low precision.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

General-purpose artificial intelligence (AI) shows promise but lacks domain-specific reliability. We evaluated the performance of CA-GPT, a novel large model deployed on an AI-OCT system, against that of the general-purpose ChatGPT-5 and junior physicians for OCT-guided PCI planning and assessment.\n  Methods: In this single-center analysis of 96 patients who underwent OCT-guided PCI, the procedural decisions generated by the CA-GPT, ChatGPT-5, and junior physicians were compared with an expert-derived procedural record. Agreement was assessed using ten pre-specified metrics across pre-PCI and post-PCI phases.\n  Results: For pre-PCI planning, CA-GPT demonstrated significantly higher median agreement scores (5[IQR 3.75-5]) compared to both ChatGPT-5 (3[2-4], P<0.001) and junior physicians (4[3-4], P<0.001). CA-GPT significantly outperformed ChatGPT-5 across all individual pre-PCI metrics and showed superior performance to junior physicians in stent diameter (90.3% vs. 72.2%, P<0.05) and length selection (80.6% vs. 52.8%, P<0.01). In post-PCI assessment, CA-GPT maintained excellent overall agreement (5[4.75-5]), significantly higher than both ChatGPT-5 (4[4-5], P<0.001) and junior physicians (5[4-5], P<0.05). Subgroup analysis confirmed CA-GPT's robust performance advantage in complex scenarios.\n  Conclusion: The CA-GPT-based AI-OCT system achieved superior decision-making agreement versus a general-purpose large language model and junior physicians across both PCI planning and assessment phases.

The methodology integrates machine learning techniques with qualitative insights from migration experts. This approach aims at improving the predictive capacity of data-driven models through the inclusion of a human-assessed covariate, an innovation that addresses challenges posed by sudden shifts in migration patterns and limitations in traditional datasets. The proposed methodology responds directly to the forecasting needs outlined in the EU Pact on Migration and Asylum, supporting the Asylum and Migration Management Regulation (AMMR). It is designed to provide policy-relevant forecasts that inform strategic decisions, early warning systems, and solidarity mechanisms among EU Member States. By joining data-driven modeling with expert judgment, this work aligns with existing academic recommendations and introduces a novel operational tool tailored for EU migration governance. The methodology is tested and validated with known data to demonstrate its applicability and reliability in migration-related policy context.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u9884\u6d4b\u6b27\u6d32\u4e94\u6761\u5173\u952e\u79fb\u6c11\u8def\u7ebf\u4e0a\u7684\u975e\u6cd5\u8fb9\u5883\u8d8a\u5883\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u8de8\u5ea6\u4e00\u5e74\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u4e0e\u79fb\u6c11\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u6d1e\u5bdf\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u7eb3\u5165\u4eba\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u79fb\u6c11\u6a21\u5f0f\u7a81\u7136\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9650\u5236\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u6b27\u76df\u79fb\u6c11\u4e0e\u5e87\u62a4\u534f\u5b9a\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u9700\u6c42\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u5e87\u62a4\u4e0e\u79fb\u6c11\u7ba1\u7406\u6cd5\u89c4\uff08AMMR\uff09\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u79fb\u6c11\u6a21\u5f0f\u7a81\u53d8\u548c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9650\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u5224\u65ad\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6b27\u76df\u6210\u5458\u56fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u653f\u7b56\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6218\u7565\u51b3\u7b56\u3001\u9884\u8b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u56e2\u7ed3\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u672f\u4e0e\u79fb\u6c11\u4e13\u5bb6\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3002\u521b\u65b0\u4e4b\u5904\u5728\u4e8e\u5f15\u5165\u4eba\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u534f\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u8be5\u53d8\u91cf\u7531\u4e13\u5bb6\u6839\u636e\u5bf9\u79fb\u6c11\u9a71\u52a8\u56e0\u7d20\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5224\u65ad\u6765\u63d0\u4f9b\u3002\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u5728\u79fb\u6c11\u653f\u7b56\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f97\u5230\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u79fb\u6c11\u76f8\u5173\u653f\u7b56\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9002\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5e94\u5bf9\u79fb\u6c11\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7a81\u7136\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u54cd\u5e94\u4e86\u6b27\u76df\u79fb\u6c11\u4e0e\u5e87\u62a4\u534f\u5b9a\u4e2d\u6982\u8ff0\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u652f\u6301AMMR\u6cd5\u89c4\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u5224\u65ad\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u4e13\u95e8\u4e3a\u6b27\u76df\u79fb\u6c11\u6cbb\u7406\u5b9a\u5236\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u653f\u7b56\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6218\u7565\u51b3\u7b56\u3001\u9884\u8b66\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u6210\u5458\u56fd\u56e2\u7ed3\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

Prior corrective approaches, such as Self-RAG, CRAG, and Adaptive-$k$, typically address this by \\textit{adding} more context or pruning existing lists. However, simply expanding the context window often leads to \\textbf{context dilution}, where distractors crowd out relevant information. We propose \\textbf{SEAL-RAG}, a training-free controller that adopts a \\textbf{``replace, don't expand''} strategy to fight context dilution under a fixed retrieval depth $k$. SEAL executes a (\\textbf{S}earch $\\rightarrow$ \\textbf{E}xtract $\\rightarrow$ \\textbf{A}ssess $\\rightarrow$ \\textbf{L}oop) cycle: it performs on-the-fly, entity-anchored extraction to build a live \\textit{gap specification} (missing entities/relations), triggers targeted micro-queries, and uses \\textit{entity-first ranking} to actively swap out distractors for gap-closing evidence. We evaluate SEAL-RAG against faithful re-implementations of Basic RAG, CRAG, Self-RAG, and Adaptive-$k$ in a shared environment on \\textbf{HotpotQA} and \\textbf{2WikiMultiHopQA}. On HotpotQA ($k=3$), SEAL improves answer correctness by \\textbf{+3--13 pp} and evidence precision by \\textbf{+12--18 pp} over Self-RAG.

These gains are statistically significant ($p<0.001$). By enforcing fixed-$k$ replacement, SEAL yields a predictable cost profile while ensuring the top-$k$ slots are optimized for precision rather than mere breadth.

We introduce token-sample complexity: the rate at which attention computed on $n$ tokens converges to its infinite-token limit. We estimate finite-$n$ convergence bounds at two levels: pointwise uniform convergence of the attention map, and convergence of moments for the transformed token distribution. For compactly supported (and more generally sub-Gaussian) distributions, our first result shows that the attention map converges uniformly on a ball of radius $R$ at rate $C(R)/\\sqrt{n}$, where $C(R)$ grows exponentially with $R$. For large $R$, this estimate loses practical value, and our second result addresses this issue by establishing convergence rates for the moments of the transformed distribution (the token output of the attention layer). In this case, the rate is $C'(R)/n^\u03b2$ with $\u03b2<\\tfrac{1}{2}$, and $C'(R)$ depends polynomially on the size of the support of the distribution. The exponent $\u03b2$ depends on the attention geometry and the spectral properties of the tokens distribution. We also examine the regime in which the attention parameter tends to infinity and the softmax approaches a hardmax, and in this setting, we establish a logarithmic rate of convergence.

For instance, is OOD necessary to HAR? Which OOD algorithm performs the best? In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing HAROOD, a comprehensive benchmark for HAR in OOD settings. We define 4 OOD scenarios: cross-person, cross-position, cross-dataset, and cross-time, and build a testbed covering 6 datasets, 16 comparative methods (implemented with CNN-based and Transformer-based architectures), and two model selection protocols. Then, we conduct extensive experiments and present several findings for future research, e.g., no single method consistently outperforms others, highlighting substantial opportunity for advancement.

The separate-transform framework employs distinct transforms for intra-frame and inter-frame compression to yield impressive rate-distortion (R-D) performance but causes evident error propagation, while the unified-transform framework eliminates error propagation via shared transforms but is inferior in ME/MC in shared latent domains. To address this limitation, in this paper, we propose a novel unifiedtransform framework with dual-domain progressive temporal alignment and quality-conditioned mixture-of-expert (QCMoE) to enable quality-consistent and error-propagation-free streaming for learned video compression. Specifically, we propose dualdomain progressive temporal alignment for ME/MC that leverages coarse pixel-domain alignment and refined latent-domain alignment to significantly enhance temporal context modeling in a coarse-to-fine fashion. The coarse pixel-domain alignment efficiently handles simple motion patterns with optical flow estimated from a single reference frame, while the refined latent-domain alignment develops a Flow-Guided Deformable Transformer (FGDT) over latents from multiple reference frames to achieve long-term motion refinement (LTMR) for complex motion patterns. Furthermore, we design a QCMoE module for continuous bit-rate adaptation that dynamically assigns different experts to adjust quantization steps per pixel based on target quality and content rather than relies on a single quantization step. QCMoE allows continuous and consistent rate control with appealing R-D performance.

Explaining outliers is crucial for understanding the underlying factors that contribute to their detection, validating their significance, and identifying potential biases or errors. Effective explanations provide actionable insights, facilitating preventive measures to avoid similar outliers in the future. Counterfactual explanations clarify why specific data points are classified as outliers by identifying minimal changes required to alter their prediction. Although valuable, most existing counterfactual explanation methods overlook the unique challenges posed by outlier detection, and fail to target classical, widely adopted outlier detection algorithms. Local Outlier Factor (LOF) is one the most popular unsupervised outlier detection methods, quantifying outlierness through relative local density. Despite LOF's widespread use across diverse applications, it lacks interpretability. To address this limitation, we introduce Density-based Counterfactuals for Outliers (DCFO), a novel method specifically designed to generate counterfactual explanations for LOF. DCFO partitions the data space into regions where LOF behaves smoothly, enabling efficient gradient-based optimisation. Extensive experimental validation on 50 OpenML datasets demonstrates that DCFO consistently outperforms benchmarked competitors, offering superior proximity and validity of generated counterfactuals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u95e8\u4e3a\u5c40\u90e8\u79bb\u7fa4\u56e0\u5b50\uff08LOF\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bc6\u5ea6\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5DCFO\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347LOF\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u7fa4\u70b9\u68c0\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u672a\u80fd\u9488\u5bf9\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u79bb\u7fa4\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u5982LOF\u3002LOF\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6700\u6d41\u884c\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u79bb\u7fa4\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u5176\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DCFO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5212\u5206\u4e3aLOF\u884c\u4e3a\u5e73\u6ed1\u7684\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3aLOF\u7b97\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "\u572850\u4e2aOpenML\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0cDCFO\u5728\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a5\u8fd1\u5ea6\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DCFO\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u4e3aLOF\u7b97\u6cd5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fd9\u4e00\u7ecf\u5178\u79bb\u7fa4\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing human-in-the-loop approaches typically assume users begin with a clear, stable concept understanding to be able to provide high-quality supervision. In reality, users often start with a vague idea and must iteratively refine it through \"concept deliberation\", a practice we uncovered through structured interviews with content moderation experts. We operationalize the common strategies in deliberation used by real content moderators into a human-in-the-loop framework called \"Agile Deliberation\" that explicitly supports evolving and subjective concepts. The system supports users in defining the concept for themselves by exposing them to borderline cases. The system does this with two deliberation stages: (1) concept scoping, which decomposes the initial concept into a structured hierarchy of sub-concepts, and (2) concept iteration, which surfaces semantically borderline examples for user reflection and feedback to iteratively align an image classifier with the user's evolving intent. Since concept deliberation is inherently subjective and interactive, we painstakingly evaluate the framework through 18 user sessions, each 1.5h long, rather than standard benchmarking datasets.

Most recent deep learning-based SFF methods typically operate in two stages: first, they extract focus volumes (a per pixel representation of focus likelihood across the focal stack) using heavy feature encoders; then, they estimate depth via a simple one-step aggregation technique that often introduces artifacts and amplifies noise in the depth map. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid framework. Our method computes multi-scale focus volumes traditionally using handcrafted Directional Dilated Laplacian (DDL) kernels, which capture long-range and directional focus variations to form robust focus volumes. These focus volumes are then fed into a lightweight, multi-scale GRU-based depth extraction module that iteratively refines an initial depth estimate at a lower resolution for computational efficiency. Finally, a learned convex upsampling module within our recurrent network reconstructs high-resolution depth maps while preserving fine scene details and sharp boundaries. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning and traditional methods, achieving superior accuracy and generalization across diverse focal conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While effective, the data structures and principles that enable this crucial capability remain poorly understood. We propose that compositional generalization fundamentally requires decomposing high-level concepts into basic, low-level concepts that can be recombined across similar contexts, similar to how humans draw analogies between concepts. For example, someone who has never seen a peacock eating rice can envision this scene by relating it to their previous observations of a chicken eating rice.\n  In this work, we formalize these intuitive processes using principles of causal modularity and minimal changes. We introduce a hierarchical data-generating process that naturally encodes different levels of concepts and their interaction mechanisms. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this approach enables compositional generalization supporting complex relations between composed concepts, advancing beyond prior work that assumes simpler interactions like additive effects. Critically, we also prove that this latent hierarchical structure is provably recoverable (identifiable) from observable data like text-image pairs, a necessary step for learning such a generative process.

While existing Safe Offline RL methods typically enforce soft expected-cost constraints, they do not guarantee forward invariance. Conversely, Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide rigorous safety guarantees but usually depend on expert-designed barrier functions or full knowledge of the system dynamics. We introduce Value-Guided Offline Control Barrier Functions (V-OCBF), a framework that learns a neural CBF entirely from offline demonstrations. Unlike prior approaches, V-OCBF does not assume access to the dynamics model; instead, it derives a recursive finite-difference barrier update, enabling model-free learning of a barrier that propagates safety information over time. Moreover, V-OCBF incorporates an expectile-based objective that avoids querying the barrier on out-of-distribution actions and restricts updates to the dataset-supported action set. The learned barrier is then used with a Quadratic Program (QP) formulation to synthesize real-time safe control. Across multiple case studies, V-OCBF yields substantially fewer safety violations than baseline methods while maintaining strong task performance, highlighting its scalability for offline synthesis of safety-critical controllers without online interaction or hand-engineered barriers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Through systematic evaluation on the multimodal HAM10000 skin lesion dataset, we demonstrate that HybridVFL significantly outperforms standard federated baselines, validating the criticality of advanced fusion mechanisms in robust, privacy-preserving systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faHybridVFL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u8026\u4e0e\u670d\u52a1\u7aef\u8de8\u6a21\u6001Transformer\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5782\u76f4\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5782\u76f4\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\uff08VFL\uff09\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u79fb\u52a8\u5065\u5eb7\u8bca\u65ad\uff09\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u5f3a\u5065\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u8026\u6280\u672f\u5904\u7406\u5206\u6563\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u654f\u611f\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u670d\u52a1\u7aef\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001Transformer\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5f62\u6210HybridVFL\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u53d8\u6570\u636e\u96c6HAM10000\u4e0a\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cHybridVFL\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u5148\u8fdb\u878d\u5408\u673a\u5236\u5728\u6784\u5efa\u5f3a\u5065\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5782\u76f4\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18AI\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While prior research has mainly focused on improving decoders, the encoder's limited ability to extract meaningful features for unseen classes remains a key bottleneck. In this work, we introduce \\textit{Take a Peek} (TaP), a simple yet effective method that enhances encoder adaptability for both FSS and cross-domain FSS (CD-FSS). TaP leverages Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the encoder on the support set with minimal computational overhead, enabling fast adaptation to novel classes while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our method is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing FSS pipelines. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks--including COCO $20^i$, Pascal $5^i$, and cross-domain datasets such as DeepGlobe, ISIC, and Chest X-ray--demonstrate that TaP consistently improves segmentation performance across diverse models and shot settings. Notably, TaP delivers significant gains in complex multi-class scenarios, highlighting its practical effectiveness in realistic settings. A rank sensitivity analysis also shows that strong performance can be achieved even with low-rank adaptations, ensuring computational efficiency. By addressing a critical limitation in FSS--the encoder's generalization to novel classes--TaP paves the way toward more robust, efficient, and generalizable segmentation systems.

While methods like sparse autoencoders (SAEs) show remarkable empirical success, they often lack theoretical guarantees, risking subjective insights. Our primary objective is to establish a principled foundation for interpretable generative models. We demonstrate that the principle of causal minimality -- favoring the simplest causal explanation -- can endow the latent representations of diffusion vision and autoregressive language models with clear causal interpretation and robust, component-wise identifiable control. We introduce a novel theoretical framework for hierarchical selection models, where higher-level concepts emerge from the constrained composition of lower-level variables, better capturing the complex dependencies in data generation. Under theoretically derived minimality conditions (manifesting as sparsity or compression constraints), we show that learned representations can be equivalent to the true latent variables of the data-generating process. Empirically, applying these constraints to leading generative models allows us to extract their innate hierarchical concept graphs, offering fresh insights into their internal knowledge organization.

Humans, in comparison, perceive complex scenes efficiently by dynamically scanning and focusing on salient regions in a sequential \"blink-like\" process. Motivated by this strategy, we first investigate whether MLLMs exhibit similar behavior. Our pilot analysis reveals that MLLMs naturally attend to different visual regions across layers and that selectively allocating more computation to salient tokens can enhance visual perception. Building on this insight, we propose Blink, a dynamic visual token resolution framework that emulates the human-inspired process within a single forward pass. Specifically, Blink includes two modules: saliency-guided scanning and dynamic token resolution. It first estimates the saliency of visual tokens in each layer based on the attention map, and extends important tokens through a plug-and-play token super-resolution (TokenSR) module. In the next layer, it drops the extended tokens when they lose focus. This dynamic mechanism balances broad exploration and fine-grained focus, thereby enhancing visual perception adaptively and efficiently. Extensive experiments validate Blink, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing visual perception and multimodal understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Based on this, we propose an absolute and relative position-dependent Green's function that enables flexible balance of equivariance and invariance for real-world modeling. The resulting operator, Green's-function Spherical Neural Operator (GSNO) with a novel spectral learning method, can adapt to anisotropic, constraint-rich systems while retaining spectral efficiency.

To address this, we present a spatial representation method for grounding objects, namely GETok, that integrates a specialized vocabulary of learnable tokens into MLLMs. GETok first uses grid tokens to partition the image plane into structured spatial anchors, and then exploits offset tokens to enable precise and iterative refinement of localization predictions. By embedding spatial relationships directly into tokens, GETok significantly advances MLLMs in native 2D space reasoning without modifying the autoregressive architecture.

Specifically, most existing GNNs mainly rely on the message passing strategy between neighbor nodes, where the expressivity is limited by the 1-dimensional Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) test. Although a number of k-WL-based GNNs have been proposed to overcome this limitation, their computational cost increases rapidly with k, significantly restricting the practical applicability. Moreover, since the k-WL models mainly operate on node tuples, these k-WL-based GNNs cannot retain fine-grained node- or edge-level semantics required by attribution methods (e.g., Integrated Gradients), leading to the less interpretable problem. To overcome the above shortcomings, in this paper, we propose a novel Line Graph Aggregation Network (LGAN), that constructs a line graph from the induced subgraph centered at each node to perform the higher-order aggregation. We theoretically prove that the LGAN not only possesses the greater expressive power than the 2-WL under injective aggregation assumptions, but also has lower time complexity. Empirical evaluations on benchmarks demonstrate that the LGAN outperforms state-of-the-art k-WL-based GNNs, while offering better interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we identify two key characteristics of extreme events: (1) the spectral disparity against normal weather regimes, and (2) the hierarchical drivers and geographic blending of diverse extremes. Along this line, we propose UniExtreme, a universal extreme weather forecasting foundation model that integrates (1) an Adaptive Frequency Modulation (AFM) module that captures region-wise spectral differences between normal and extreme weather, through learnable Beta-distribution filters and multi-granularity spectral aggregation, and (2) an Event Prior Augmentation (EPA) module which incorporates region-specific extreme event priors to resolve hierarchical extreme diversity and composite extreme schema, via a dual-level memory fusion network.

However, robust ISLR is fundamentally constrained by data scarcity and the long-tail distribution of sign vocabulary, where gathering sufficient examples for thousands of unique signs is prohibitively expensive. Standard classification approaches struggle under these conditions, often overfitting to frequent classes while failing to generalize to rare ones. To address this bottleneck, we propose a Few-Shot Prototypical Network framework adapted for a skeleton based encoder. Unlike traditional classifiers that learn fixed decision boundaries, our approach utilizes episodic training to learn a semantic metric space where signs are classified based on their proximity to dynamic class prototypes. We integrate a Spatiotemporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) with a novel Multi-Scale Temporal Aggregation (MSTA) module to capture both rapid and fluid motion dynamics. Experimental results on the WLASL dataset demonstrate the superiority of this metric learning paradigm: our model achieves 43.75% Top-1 and 77.10% Top-5 accuracy on the test set. Crucially, this outperforms a standard classification baseline sharing the identical backbone architecture by over 13%, proving that the prototypical training strategy effectively outperforms in a data scarce situation where standard classification fails. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, achieving nearly 30% accuracy on the unseen SignASL dataset without fine-tuning, offering a scalable pathway for recognizing extensive sign vocabularies with limited data.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

By aligning feature scales across encoder-decoder and enabling streamlined cross-scale propagation, our symmetric design preserves intrinsic degradation signals robustly, rendering simple additive fusion in skip connections sufficient for state-of-the-art performance. Our primary baseline, SymUNet, is built on this symmetric U-Net and achieves better results across benchmark datasets than existing approaches while reducing computational cost. We further propose a semantic enhanced variant, SE-SymUNet, which integrates direct semantic injection from frozen CLIP features via simple cross-attention to explicitly amplify degradation priors. Extensive experiments on several benchmarks validate the superiority of our methods.

However, most existing SOD methods assume low-noise visual conditions, overlooking the degradation of segmentation accuracy caused by weather-induced noise in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a SOD framework tailored for diverse weather conditions, encompassing a specific encoder and a replaceable decoder. To enable handling of varying weather noises, we introduce a one-hot vector as a noise indicator to represent different weather types and design a Noise Indicator Fusion Module (NIFM). The NIFM takes both semantic features and the noise indicator as dual inputs and is inserted between consecutive stages of the encoder to embed weather-aware priors via adaptive feature modulation.

Existing approaches often require large-scale player trajectories, train separate models for different player types, or provide no direct mapping between interpretable behavioral parameters and the learned policy, limiting their scalability and controllability. We define player behavior in an N-dimensional continuous space and uniformly sample target behavior vectors from a region that encompasses the subset representing real human styles. During training, each agent receives both its current and target behavior vectors as input, and the reward is based on the normalized reduction in distance between them. This allows the policy to learn how actions influence behavioral statistics, enabling smooth control over attributes such as aggressiveness, mobility, and cooperativeness. A single PPO-based multi-agent policy can reproduce new or unseen play styles without retraining. Experiments conducted in a custom multi-player Unity game show that the proposed framework produces significantly greater behavioral diversity than a win-only baseline and reliably matches specified behavior vectors across diverse targets.

While large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) offer a promising path to bridge this gap, existing methods often rely on costly, domain-specific training, and there is a lack of benchmarks to evaluate the practical utility of VLM-generated text in a zero-shot retrieval context. To address this research gap, we introduce the Remote Sensing Rich Text (RSRT) dataset, a new benchmark featuring multiple structured captions per image. Based on this dataset, we propose a fully training-free, text-only retrieval reference called TRSLLaVA. Our methodology reformulates cross-modal retrieval as a text-to-text (T2T) matching problem, leveraging rich text descriptions as queries against a database of VLM-generated captions within a unified textual embedding space. This approach completely bypasses model training or fine-tuning. Experiments on the RSITMD and RSICD benchmarks show our training-free method is highly competitive with state-of-the-art supervised models. For instance, on RSITMD, our method achieves a mean Recall of 42.62\\%, nearly doubling the 23.86\\% of the standard zero-shot CLIP baseline and surpassing several top supervised models.

However, in many scientific and engineering domains, clean data are often unavailable: instead, we only observe measurements corrupted through a noisy, ill-conditioned channel. A generative model for the original data thus requires solving an inverse problem at the level of distributions. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to this task based on Stochastic Interpolants: we iteratively update a transport map between corrupted and clean data samples using only access to the corrupted dataset as well as black box access to the corruption channel. Under appropriate conditions, this iterative procedure converges towards a self-consistent transport map that effectively inverts the corruption channel, thus enabling a generative model for the clean data. We refer to the resulting method as the self-consistent stochastic interpolant (SCSI). It (i) is computationally efficient compared to variational alternatives, (ii) highly flexible, handling arbitrary nonlinear forward models with only black-box access, and (iii) enjoys theoretical guarantees.

Discrete diffusion language models (DLMs) have been proposed as an alternative to autoregressive language models (ALMs). However, their scaling behavior has not yet been fully explored, with prior work suggesting that they require more data and compute to match the performance of ALMs.\n  We study the scaling behavior of DLMs on different noise types by smoothly interpolating between masked and uniform diffusion while paying close attention to crucial hyperparameters such as batch size and learning rate. Our experiments reveal that the scaling behavior of DLMs strongly depends on the noise type and is considerably different from ALMs. While all noise types converge to similar loss values in compute-bound scaling, we find that uniform diffusion requires more parameters and less data for compute-efficient training compared to masked diffusion, making them a promising candidate in data-bound settings. We scale our uniform diffusion model up to 10B parameters trained for $10^{22}$ FLOPs, confirming the predicted scaling behavior and making it the largest publicly known uniform diffusion model to date.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08DLM\uff09\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\u5747\u5300\u6269\u6563\u6bd4\u63a9\u7801\u6269\u6563\u5728\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u66f4\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u5747\u5300\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u5230100\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3LLM\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d88\u8017\u5927\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u533a\u5206\u56e0\u7d20\u3002\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5176\u7f29\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u8ba4\u4e3aDLM\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u624d\u80fd\u5339\u914dALM\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u6ed1\u63d2\u503c\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u5747\u5300\u6269\u6563\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u4e0d\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u7c7b\u578b\u4e0bDLM\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u5c06\u5747\u5300\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6269\u5c55\u5230100\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u8fbe10^22 FLOPs\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0DLM\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u70c8\u4f9d\u8d56\u566a\u58f0\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u4e0eALMs\u6709\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u4e2d\u6240\u6709\u566a\u58f0\u7c7b\u578b\u6536\u655b\u5230\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u635f\u5931\u503c\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5747\u5300\u6269\u6563\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u591a\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u66f4\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u6269\u5c55\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u7f29\u653e\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5747\u5300\u6269\u6563\u5728\u6570\u636e\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u662f\u5f88\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u5019\u9009\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u8fc4\u4eca\u4e3a\u6b62\u516c\u5f00\u5df2\u77e5\u6700\u5927\u7684\u5747\u5300\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e3aDLM\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u53c2\u8003\u3002"}}

While vision language models (VLMs) have significantly advanced this task, achieving reliable, high-quality parsing in real-world scenarios remains challenging. Common practice often selects the top-performing model on standard benchmarks. However, these benchmarks may carry dataset-specific biases, leading to inconsistent model rankings and limited correlation with real-world performance. Moreover, benchmark metrics typically provide only overall scores, which can obscure distinct error patterns in output. This raises a key challenge: how can we reliably and comprehensively assess document parsing quality in the wild? We address this problem with DOCR-Inspector, which formalizes document parsing assessment as fine-grained error detection and analysis. Leveraging VLM-as-a-Judge, DOCR-Inspector analyzes a document image and its parsed output, identifies all errors, assigns them to one of 28 predefined types, and produces a comprehensive quality assessment. To enable this capability, we construct DOCRcase-200K for training and propose the Chain-of-Checklist reasoning paradigm to enable the hierarchical structure of parsing quality assessment. For empirical validation, we introduce DOCRcaseBench, a set of 882 real-world document parsing cases with manual annotations. On this benchmark, DOCR-Inspector-7B outperforms commercial models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, as well as leading open-source models. Further experiments demonstrate that its quality assessments provide valuable guidance for parsing results refinement, making DOCR-Inspector both a practical evaluator and a driver for advancing document parsing systems at scale.

While recent deep learning-based trackers achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on challenging benchmarks, their reliance on per-frame GPU inference poses a major barrier to deployment on resource-constrained edge devices, where compute, power, and connectivity are limited. We introduce K-Track (Kalman-enhanced Tracking), a general-purpose, tracker-agnostic acceleration framework designed to bridge this deployment gap. K-Track reduces inference cost by combining sparse deep learning keyframe updates with lightweight Kalman filtering for intermediate frame prediction, using principled Bayesian uncertainty propagation to maintain temporal coherence.

Detecting such person-driven manipulations requires systems that not only distinguish altered content from authentic media but also provide clear and reliable reasoning. In this paper, we introduce TriDF, a comprehensive benchmark for interpretable DeepFake detection. TriDF contains high-quality forgeries from advanced synthesis models, covering 16 DeepFake types across image, video, and audio modalities. The benchmark evaluates three key aspects: Perception, which measures the ability of a model to identify fine-grained manipulation artifacts using human-annotated evidence; Detection, which assesses classification performance across diverse forgery families and generators; and Hallucination, which quantifies the reliability of model-generated explanations. Experiments on state-of-the-art multimodal large language models show that accurate perception is essential for reliable detection, but hallucination can severely disrupt decision-making, revealing the interdependence of these three aspects.

To address this, we present NaviHydra, a controllable navigation-guided end-to-end model distilled from an existing rule-based simulator. Our framework accepts high-level navigation commands as control signals, generating trajectories that align with specified intentions. We utilize a Bird's Eye View (BEV) based trajectory gathering method to enhance the trajectory feature extraction. Additionally, we introduce a novel navigation compliance metric to evaluate adherence to intended route, improving controllability and navigation safety. To comprehensively assess our model's controllability, we design a test that evaluates its response to various navigation commands. Our method significantly outperforms baseline models, achieving state-of-the-art results in the NAVSIM benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness in advancing autonomous driving.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While current models excel at capturing an object's surface geometry and appearance, they largely neglect its internal physical properties. This omission is critical, as properties like volumetric density are fundamental for predicting an object's center of mass, stability, and interaction dynamics in applications ranging from robotic manipulation to physical simulation. The primary bottleneck has been the absence of large-scale, real-world data. To bridge this gap, we introduce XDen-1K, the first large-scale, multi-modal dataset designed for real-world physical property estimation, with a particular focus on volumetric density. The core of this dataset consists of 1,000 real-world objects across 148 categories, for which we provide comprehensive multi-modal data, including a high-resolution 3D geometric model with part-level annotations and a corresponding set of real-world biplanar X-ray scans. Building upon this data, we introduce a novel optimization framework that recovers a high-fidelity volumetric density field of each object from its sparse X-ray views. To demonstrate its practical value, we add X-ray images as a conditioning signal to an existing segmentation network and perform volumetric segmentation. Furthermore, we conduct experiments on downstream robotics tasks. The results show that leveraging the dataset can effectively improve the accuracy of center-of-mass estimation and the success rate of robotic manipulation. We believe XDen-1K will serve as a foundational resource and a challenging new benchmark, catalyzing future research in physically grounded visual inference and embodied AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While prior work has largely focused on pixel-level uncertainty, landmark-based segmentation offers inherent topological guarantees yet remains underexplored from an uncertainty perspective. In this work, we study uncertainty estimation for anatomical landmark-based segmentation on chest X-rays. Inspired by hybrid neural network architectures that combine standard image convolutional encoders with graph-based generative decoders, and leveraging their variational latent space, we derive two complementary measures: (i) latent uncertainty, captured directly from the learned distribution parameters, and (ii) predictive uncertainty, obtained by generating multiple stochastic output predictions from latent samples. Through controlled corruption experiments we show that both uncertainty measures increase with perturbation severity, reflecting both global and local degradation. We demonstrate that these uncertainty signals can identify unreliable predictions by comparing with manual ground-truth, and support out-of-distribution detection on the CheXmask dataset. More importantly, we release CheXmask-U (huggingface.co/datasets/mcosarinsky/CheXmask-U), a large scale dataset of 657,566 chest X-ray landmark segmentations with per-node uncertainty estimates, enabling researchers to account for spatial variations in segmentation quality when using these anatomical masks.

However, we find that current VLMs struggle to understand fine-grained 3D spatial relationships which is a fundamental requirement for systems interacting with the physical world. To address this issue, we propose SpaceDrive, a spatial-aware VLM-based driving framework that treats spatial information as explicit positional encodings (PEs) instead of textual digit tokens, enabling joint reasoning over semantic and spatial representations. SpaceDrive employs a universal positional encoder to all 3D coordinates derived from multi-view depth estimation, historical ego-states, and text prompts. These 3D PEs are first superimposed to augment the corresponding 2D visual tokens. Meanwhile, they serve as a task-agnostic coordinate representation, replacing the digit-wise numerical tokens as both inputs and outputs for the VLM. This mechanism enables the model to better index specific visual semantics in spatial reasoning and directly regress trajectory coordinates rather than generating digit-by-digit, thereby enhancing planning accuracy. Extensive experiments validate that SpaceDrive achieves state-of-the-art open-loop performance on the nuScenes dataset and the second-best Driving Score of 78.02 on the Bench2Drive closed-loop benchmark over existing VLM-based methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this, we propose VeloDepth, an efficient and robust online video depth estimation pipeline that effectively leverages spatiotemporal priors from previous depth predictions and performs deep feature propagation.

However, these models typically treat understanding and generation separately, limiting the mutual benefits that could arise from interactive feedback between tasks. In this work, we reveal that motion assessment and refinement tasks act as crucial bridges to enable bidirectional knowledge flow between understanding and generation. Leveraging this insight, we propose Interleaved Reasoning for Motion Generation (IRMoGen), a novel paradigm that tightly couples motion generation with assessment and refinement through iterative text-motion dialogue. To realize this, we introduce IRG-MotionLLM, the first model that seamlessly interleaves motion generation, assessment, and refinement to improve generation performance.

To facilitate this development, we construct an automated data engine to synthesize interleaved reasoning annotations from existing text-motion datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: (i) Assessment and refinement tasks significantly improve text-motion alignment; (ii) Interleaving motion generation, assessment, and refinement steps yields consistent performance gains across training stages; and (iii) IRG-MotionLLM clearly outperforms the baseline model and achieves advanced performance on standard text-to-motion generation benchmarks.

To address these challenges, we develop an end to end pipeline that automates coronary geometry extraction from coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA), streamlines simulation data generation, and enables efficient learning of coronary blood pressure distributions. The pipeline reduces the manual burden associated with traditional CFD workflows while producing consistent training data. We further introduce a diffusion-based regression model designed to predict coronary blood pressure directly from CCTA derived features, bypassing the need for slow CFD computation during inference.

We investigate a fundamental question: what aspect of the target representation matters for generation, its \\textit{global} \\revision{semantic} information (e.g., measured by ImageNet-1K accuracy) or its spatial structure (i.e. pairwise cosine similarity between patch tokens)? Prevalent wisdom holds that stronger global semantic performance leads to better generation as a target representation. To study this, we first perform a large-scale empirical analysis across 27 different vision encoders and different model scales. The results are surprising; spatial structure, rather than global performance, drives the generation performance of a target representation. To further study this, we introduce two straightforward modifications, which specifically accentuate the transfer of \\emph{spatial} information. We replace the standard MLP projection layer in REPA with a simple convolution layer and introduce a spatial normalization layer for the external representation. Surprisingly, our simple method (implemented in $<$4 lines of code), termed iREPA, consistently improves convergence speed of REPA, across a diverse set of vision encoders, model sizes, and training variants (such as REPA, REPA-E, Meanflow, JiT etc). %, etc. Our work motivates revisiting the fundamental working mechanism of representational alignment and how it can be leveraged for improved training of generative models.

Existing approaches often rely on random or static patch selection, leading to the inclusion of redundant or non-informative regions that degrade performance. To address this, we propose a Graph Laplacian Attention-Based Transformer (GLAT) integrated with an Iterative Refinement Module (IRM) to enhance both feature learning and spatial consistency. The IRM iteratively refines patch selection by leveraging a pretrained ResNet50 for local feature extraction and a foundation model in no-gradient mode for importance scoring, ensuring only the most relevant tissue regions are preserved. The GLAT models tissue-level connectivity by constructing a graph where patches serve as nodes, ensuring spatial consistency through graph Laplacian constraints and refining feature representations via a learnable filtering mechanism that enhances discriminative histological structures. Additionally, a convex aggregation mechanism dynamically adjusts patch importance to generate a robust WSI-level representation.

When domain generalization (DG) encounters noise, noisy labels further exacerbate the emergence of spurious features in deep layers, i.e. spurious feature enlargement, leading to a degradation in the performance of existing algorithms. This paper, starting from domain generalization, explores how to make existing methods rework when meeting noise. We find that the latent features inside the model have certain discriminative capabilities, and different latent features focus on different parts of the image. Based on these observations, we propose the Self-Ensemble Post Learning approach (SEPL) to diversify features which can be leveraged. Specifically, SEPL consists of two parts: feature probing training and prediction ensemble inference. It leverages intermediate feature representations within the model architecture, training multiple probing classifiers to fully exploit the capabilities of pre-trained models, while the final predictions are obtained through the integration of outputs from these diverse classification heads. Considering the presence of noisy labels, we employ semi-supervised algorithms to train probing classifiers. Given that different probing classifiers focus on different areas, we integrate their predictions using a crowdsourcing inference approach. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method not only enhances the robustness of existing methods but also exhibits significant potential for real-world applications with high flexibility.", "AI": {"tldr": "SEPL\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7279\u5f81\u63a2\u9488\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u6210\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5728\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u9047\u5230\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316(DG)\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u9047\u5230\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\uff0c\u566a\u58f0\u4f1a\u52a0\u5267\u6df1\u5c42\u865a\u5047\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u653e\u5927\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u73b0\u6709\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u89d2\u5ea6\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u9047\u5230\u566a\u58f0\u65f6\u4f7f\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u91cd\u65b0\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u96c6\u6210\u540e\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5(SEPL)\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u90e8\u5206\uff1a1)\u7279\u5f81\u63a2\u9488\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u5185\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u4e2a\u63a2\u9488\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u7b97\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\uff1b2)\u9884\u6d4b\u96c6\u6210\u63a8\u7406\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u4f17\u5305\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u6574\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u5173\u6ce8\u533a\u57df\u7684\u63a2\u9488\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u548c\u663e\u8457\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "SEPL\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u6316\u6398\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u95f4\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u5224\u522b\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u63a2\u9488\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u5bf9\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

The scarcity of large-scale, naturally captured 4D mesh datasets further limits the ability to train generalizable video-to-4D models from scratch in a purely data-driven manner. Meanwhile, advances in image-to-3D generation, supported by extensive datasets, offer powerful prior models that can be leveraged. To better utilize these priors while minimizing reliance on 4D supervision, we introduce SWiT-4D, a Sliding-Window Transformer for lossless, parameter-free temporal 4D mesh generation. SWiT-4D integrates seamlessly with any Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based image-to-3D generator, adding spatial-temporal modeling across video frames while preserving the original single-image forward process, enabling 4D mesh reconstruction from videos of arbitrary length. To recover global translation, we further introduce an optimization-based trajectory module tailored for static-camera monocular videos. SWiT-4D demonstrates strong data efficiency: with only a single short (<10s) video for fine-tuning, it achieves high-fidelity geometry and stable temporal consistency, indicating practical deployability under extremely limited 4D supervision. Comprehensive experiments on both in-domain zoo-test sets and challenging out-of-domain benchmarks (C4D, Objaverse, and in-the-wild videos) show that SWiT-4D consistently outperforms existing baselines in temporal smoothness.

We formalize this gap as Category-Agnostic Motion Capture (CAMoCap): given a monocular video and an arbitrary rigged 3D asset as a prompt, the goal is to reconstruct a rotation-based animation such as BVH that directly drives the specific asset. We present MoCapAnything, a reference-guided, factorized framework that first predicts 3D joint trajectories and then recovers asset-specific rotations via constraint-aware inverse kinematics. The system contains three learnable modules and a lightweight IK stage: (1) a Reference Prompt Encoder that extracts per-joint queries from the asset's skeleton, mesh, and rendered images; (2) a Video Feature Extractor that computes dense visual descriptors and reconstructs a coarse 4D deforming mesh to bridge the gap between video and joint space; and (3) a Unified Motion Decoder that fuses these cues to produce temporally coherent trajectories. We also curate Truebones Zoo with 1038 motion clips, each providing a standardized skeleton-mesh-render triad. Experiments on both in-domain benchmarks and in-the-wild videos show that MoCapAnything delivers high-quality skeletal animations and exhibits meaningful cross-species retargeting across heterogeneous rigs, enabling scalable, prompt-driven 3D motion capture for arbitrary assets.

Traditional approaches detect tables first, then recognize their structure. Recently, interest has surged in developing methods, such as vision-language models (VLMs), that can extract tables directly in their full page or document context. However, progress has been difficult to demonstrate due to a lack of annotated data. To address this, we create a new large-scale dataset, PubTables-v2. PubTables-v2 supports a number of current challenging table extraction tasks. Notably, it is the first large-scale benchmark for multi-page table structure recognition. We demonstrate its usefulness by evaluating domain-specialized VLMs on these tasks and highlighting current progress. Finally, we use PubTables-v2 to create the Page-Object Table Transformer (POTATR), an image-to-graph extension of the Table Transformer to comprehensive page-level TE. Data, code, and trained models will be released.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce DuetSVG, a unified multimodal model that jointly generates image tokens and corresponding SVG tokens in an end-to-end manner. DuetSVG is trained on both image and SVG datasets. At inference, we apply a novel test-time scaling strategy that leverages the model's native visual predictions as guidance to improve SVG decoding quality.

However, state-of-the-art models still struggle on recent motion benchmarks, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale, fine-grained motion datasets. Existing motion datasets are often constructed from costly manual annotation, severely limiting scalability. To address this challenge, we introduce FoundationMotion, a fully automated data curation pipeline that constructs large-scale motion datasets. Our approach first detects and tracks objects in videos to extract their trajectories, then leverages these trajectories and video frames with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate fine-grained captions and diverse question-answer pairs about motion and spatial reasoning. Using datasets produced by this pipeline, we fine-tune open-source models including NVILA-Video-15B and Qwen2.5-7B, achieving substantial improvements in motion understanding without compromising performance on other tasks. Notably, our models outperform strong closed-source baselines like Gemini-2.5 Flash and large open-source models such as Qwen2.5-VL-72B across diverse motion understanding datasets and benchmarks.

However, real-world applications are limited, as current methods achieve high visual fidelity but slow or fast yet temporally unstable. Diffusion methods provide realistic image generation, yet struggle with oneshot settings. Gaussian Splatting approaches are real-time, yet inaccuracies in facial tracking, or inconsistent Gaussian mappings, lead to unstable outputs and video artifacts that are detrimental to realistic use cases.

Instead of autoregressively generating tokens as in classical VLMs, VL-JEPA predicts continuous embeddings of the target texts. By learning in an abstract representation space, the model focuses on task-relevant semantics while abstracting away surface-level linguistic variability. In a strictly controlled comparison against standard token-space VLM training with the same vision encoder and training data, VL-JEPA achieves stronger performance while having 50% fewer trainable parameters. At inference time, a lightweight text decoder is invoked only when needed to translate VL-JEPA predicted embeddings into text. We show that VL-JEPA natively supports selective decoding that reduces the number of decoding operations by 2.85x while maintaining similar performance compared to non-adaptive uniform decoding. Beyond generation, the VL-JEPA's embedding space naturally supports open-vocabulary classification, text-to-video retrieval, and discriminative VQA without any architecture modification. On eight video classification and eight video retrieval datasets, the average performance VL-JEPA surpasses that of CLIP, SigLIP2, and Perception Encoder. At the same time, the model achieves comparable performance as classical VLMs (InstructBLIP, QwenVL) on four VQA datasets: GQA, TallyQA, POPE and POPEv2, despite only having 1.6B parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing referring video segmentation datasets often focus on salient objects and use language expressions rich in static attributes, potentially allowing the target object to be identified in a single frame. Such datasets underemphasize the role of motion in both videos and languages. To explore the feasibility of using motion expressions and motion reasoning clues for pixel-level video understanding, we introduce MeViS, a dataset containing 33,072 human-annotated motion expressions in both text and audio, covering 8,171 objects in 2,006 videos of complex scenarios. We benchmark 15 existing methods across 4 tasks supported by MeViS, including 6 referring video object segmentation (RVOS) methods, 3 audio-guided video object segmentation (AVOS) methods, 2 referring multi-object tracking (RMOT) methods, and 4 video captioning methods for the newly introduced referring motion expression generation (RMEG) task. The results demonstrate weaknesses and limitations of existing methods in addressing motion expression-guided video understanding. We further analyze the challenges and propose an approach LMPM++ for RVOS/AVOS/RMOT that achieves new state-of-the-art results. Our dataset provides a platform that facilitates the development of motion expression-guided video understanding algorithms in complex video scenes.

Flex employs a small set of learnable scene tokens to jointly encode information from all image tokens across different cameras and timesteps. By design, our approach is geometry-agnostic, learning a compact scene representation directly from data without relying on the explicit 3D inductive biases, such as Bird-Eye-View (BEV), occupancy or tri-plane representations, which are common in prior work. This holistic encoding strategy aggressively compresses the visual input for the downstream Large Language Model (LLM) based policy model. Evaluated on a large-scale proprietary dataset of 20,000 driving hours, our Flex achieves 2.2x greater inference throughput while improving driving performance by a large margin compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we show that these compact scene tokens develop an emergent capability for scene decomposition without any explicit supervision.

However, existing methods often fail to explicitly model degradation types and struggle to adapt their restoration behavior to complex or mixed degradations. To address these issues, we propose ClusIR, a Cluster-Guided Image Restoration framework that explicitly models degradation semantics through learnable clustering and propagates cluster-aware cues across spatial and frequency domains for adaptive restoration. Specifically, ClusIR comprises two key components: a Probabilistic Cluster-Guided Routing Mechanism (PCGRM) and a Degradation-Aware Frequency Modulation Module (DAFMM). The proposed PCGRM disentangles degradation recognition from expert activation, enabling discriminative degradation perception and stable expert routing.

In this paper, we present E-RayZer, a self-supervised large 3D Vision model that learns truly 3D-aware representations directly from unlabeled images. Unlike prior self-supervised methods such as RayZer that infer 3D indirectly through latent-space view synthesis, E-RayZer operates directly in 3D space, performing self-supervised 3D reconstruction with Explicit geometry. This formulation eliminates shortcut solutions and yields representations that are geometrically grounded. To ensure convergence and scalability, we introduce a novel fine-grained learning curriculum that organizes training from easy to hard samples and harmonizes heterogeneous data sources in an entirely unsupervised manner. Experiments demonstrate that E-RayZer significantly outperforms RayZer on pose estimation, matches or sometimes surpasses fully supervised reconstruction models such as VGGT. Furthermore, its learned representations outperform leading visual pre-training models (e.g., DINOv3, CroCo v2, VideoMAE V2, and RayZer) when transferring to 3D downstream tasks, establishing E-RayZer as a new paradigm for 3D-aware visual pre-training.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While all previous methods generate images independently at inference, we instead ask if samples can be generated collaboratively. We propose Group Diffusion, unlocking the attention mechanism to be shared across images, rather than limited to just the patches within an image. This enables images to be jointly denoised at inference time, learning both intra and inter-image correspondence. We observe a clear scaling effect - larger group sizes yield stronger cross-sample attention and better generation quality. Furthermore, we introduce a qualitative measure to capture this behavior and show that its strength closely correlates with FID. Built on standard diffusion transformers, our GroupDiff achieves up to 32.2% FID improvement on ImageNet-256x256.

However, existing methods rely on holistic embeddings from general-purpose image encoders, which entangle multiple visual factors and make it difficult to isolate a single attribute. This often leads to information leakage and incoherent synthesis. To address this limitation, we introduce Omni-Attribute, the first open-vocabulary image attribute encoder designed to learn high-fidelity, attribute-specific representations. Our approach jointly designs the data and model: (i) we curate semantically linked image pairs annotated with positive and negative attributes to explicitly teach the encoder what to preserve or suppress; and (ii) we adopt a dual-objective training paradigm that balances generative fidelity with contrastive disentanglement. The resulting embeddings prove effective for open-vocabulary attribute retrieval, personalization, and compositional generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

NFMs directly map monocular visual input to control actions and ignore mid-level vision modules (tracking, depth estimation, etc) entirely. While the assumption that vision capabilities will emerge implicitly is compelling, it requires large amounts of pixel-to-action supervision that are difficult to obtain. The challenge is especially pronounced in dynamic and unstructured settings, where robust navigation requires precise geometric and dynamic understanding, while the depth-scale ambiguity in monocular views further limits accurate spatial reasoning. In this paper, we show that relying on monocular vision and ignoring mid-level vision priors is inefficient.\n  We present StereoWalker, which augments NFMs with stereo inputs and explicit mid-level vision such as depth estimation and dense pixel tracking. Our intuition is straightforward: stereo inputs resolve the depth-scale ambiguity, and modern mid-level vision models provide reliable geometric and motion structure in dynamic scenes. We also curate a large stereo navigation dataset with automatic action annotation from Internet stereo videos to support training of StereoWalker and to facilitate future research. Through our experiments, we find that mid-level vision enables StereoWalker to achieve a comparable performance as the state-of-the-art using only 1.5% of the training data, and surpasses the state-of-the-art using the full data.
