While recent techniques leverage saliency or transformer attention, they merely address global context of the video signal by using static maps as auxiliary inputs rather than embedding context fundamentally within feature extraction of the video sequence. We present Dynamic Attention with Global Registers for Video Quality Assessment (DAGR-VQA), the first framework integrating register-token directly into a convolutional backbone for spatio-temporal, dynamic saliency prediction. By embedding learnable register tokens as global context carriers, our model enables dynamic, HVS-inspired attention, producing temporally adaptive saliency maps that track salient regions over time without explicit motion estimation. Our model integrates dynamic saliency maps with RGB inputs, capturing spatial data and analyzing it through a temporal transformer to deliver a perceptually consistent video quality assessment. Comprehensive tests conducted on the LSVQ, KonVid-1k, LIVE-VQC, and YouTube-UGC datasets show that the performance is highly competitive, surpassing the majority of top baselines. Research on ablation studies demonstrates that the integration of register tokens promotes the development of stable and temporally consistent attention mechanisms. Achieving an efficiency of 387.7 FPS at 1080p, DAGR-VQA demonstrates computational performance suitable for real-time applications like multimedia streaming systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this study, chest CT images included in the Lung Image Database Consortium and Image Database Resource Initiative (LIDC-IDRI) datasets were used. Regions of interest surrounding the pulmonary nodules were extracted from these images, and image findings and questions were defined based on morphological characteristics recorded in the database. A dataset comprising pairs of cropped images, corresponding questions, and image findings was constructed, and the VQA model was fine-tuned on it. Language evaluation metrics such as BLEU were used to evaluate the generated image findings. The VQA dataset constructed using the proposed method contained image findings with natural expressions as radiological descriptions. In addition, the generated image findings showed a high CIDEr score of 3.896, and a high agreement with the reference findings was obtained through evaluation based on morphological characteristics. We constructed a VQA dataset for chest CT images using structured information on the morphological characteristics from the LIDC-IDRI dataset.

However, in clinical practice, it is difficult to collect the large amount of CT images for specific cases, such as small cell carcinoma with low epidemiological incidence or benign tumors that are difficult to distinguish from malignant ones. This leads to the challenge of data imbalance. In this study, to address this issue, we proposed a method to automatically generate chest CT nodule images that capture target features using latent diffusion models (LDM) and verified its effectiveness. Using the LIDC-IDRI dataset, we created pairs of nodule images and finding-based text prompts based on physician evaluations. For the image generation models, we used Stable Diffusion version 1.5 (SDv1) and 2.0 (SDv2), which are types of LDM. Each model was fine-tuned using the created dataset. During the generation process, we adjusted the guidance scale (GS), which indicates the fidelity to the input text. Both quantitative and subjective evaluations showed that SDv2 (GS = 5) achieved the best performance in terms of image quality, diversity, and text consistency. In the subjective evaluation, no statistically significant differences were observed between the generated images and real images, confirming that the quality was equivalent to real clinical images. We proposed a method for generating chest CT nodule images based on input text using LDM. Evaluation results demonstrated that the proposed method could generate high-quality images that successfully capture specific medical features.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Formally, given a connection range $r$, a hard RGG $G_m$ on $m$ vertices is formed by drawing $m$ random points from a spatial domain, and then connecting any two points with an edge when they are within a distance $r$ from each other. The two domains we consider are the $d$-dimensional unit cube $[0,1]^d$ and the $d$-dimensional unit torus $\\mathbb{T}^d$. We derive upper bounds on the entropy $H(G_m)$ for both these domains and for all possible values of $r$. In a few cases, we obtain an exact asymptotic characterization of the entropy by proving a tight lower bound. Our main results are that $H(G_m) \\sim dm \\log_2m$ for $0 < r \\leq 1/4$ in the case of $\\mathbb{T}^d$ and that the entropy of a one-dimensional RGG on $[0,1]$ behaves like $m\\log m$ for all $0<r<1$. As a consequence, we can infer that the asymptotic structural entropy of an RGG on $\\mathbb{T}^d$, which is the entropy of an unlabelled RGG, is $\u03a9((d-1)m \\log_2m)$ for $0 < r \\leq 1/4$. For the rest of the cases, we conjecture that the entropy behaves asymptotically as the leading order terms of our derived upper bounds.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing approaches face trade-offs: affine transformations are smooth and analytically invertible but lack expressivity; monotonic splines offer local control but are only piecewise smooth and act on bounded domains; residual flows achieve smoothness but need numerical inversion. We introduce three families of analytic bijections -- cubic rational, sinh, and cubic polynomial -- that are globally smooth ($C^\\infty$), defined on all of $\\mathbb{R}$, and analytically invertible in closed form, combining the favorable properties of all prior approaches. These bijections serve as drop-in replacements in coupling flows, matching or exceeding spline performance. Beyond coupling layers, we develop radial flows: a novel architecture using direct parametrization that transforms the radial coordinate while preserving angular direction. Radial flows exhibit exceptional training stability, produce geometrically interpretable transformations, and on targets with radial structure can achieve comparable quality to coupling flows with $1000\\times$ fewer parameters.

On average, 27% of the data in each submission are unnecessary, totaling >580 GB of redundant content across our dataset. Qualitative inspection reveals the presence of offensive/inappropriate text (e.g., \"WTF does this mean?\") and experimental details that could disclose ongoing research. We have contacted arXiv's leadership team, as well as the authors of affected papers to alert them of these issues.

However, naive uniform transfer from multiple source tasks may result in negative transfer, highlighting the need to properly balance the contributions of heterogeneous sources. Moreover, existing transfer learning methods typically focus on optimizing either the source weights or the amount of transferred samples, while largely neglecting the joint consideration of the other. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework, Unified Optimization of Weights and Quantities (UOWQ), which formulates multi-source transfer learning as a parameter estimation problem grounded in an asymptotic analysis of a Kullback-Leibler divergence-based generalization error measure. The proposed framework jointly determines the optimal source weights and optimal transfer quantities for each source task. Firstly, we prove that using all available source samples is always optimal once the weights are properly adjusted, and we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon. Moreover, to determine the optimal transfer weights, our analysis yields closed-form solutions in the single-source setting and develops a convex optimization-based numerical procedure for the multi-source case. Building on the theoretical results, we further propose practical algorithms for both multi-source transfer learning and multi-task learning settings. Extensive experiments on real-world benchmarks, including DomainNet and Office-Home, demonstrate that UOWQ consistently outperforms strong baselines. The results validate both the theoretical predictions and the practical effectiveness of our framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86UOWQ\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6e90\u4efb\u52a1\u6743\u91cd\u548c\u8f6c\u79fb\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u6e90\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5355\u72ec\u4f18\u5316\u6e90\u6743\u91cd\u6216\u8f6c\u79fb\u6837\u672c\u91cf\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4e8c\u8005\u7684\u8054\u5408\u8003\u8651\uff1b\u4e14\u5747\u5300\u5730\u4ece\u591a\u6e90\u4efb\u52a1\u8f6c\u79fb\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u57fa\u4e8eKullback-Leibler\u6563\u5ea6\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u591a\u6e90\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u53c2\u6570\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u5355\u6e90\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u591a\u6e90\u60c5\u51b5\u5f00\u53d1\u57fa\u4e8e\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6570\u503c\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a\u4e00\u65e6\u6743\u91cd\u8c03\u6574\u5f97\u5f53\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6240\u6709\u53ef\u7528\u6e90\u6837\u672c\u603b\u662f\u6700\u4f18\u7684\uff1b\u5728DomainNet\u548cOffice-Home\u7b49\u771f\u5b9e\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eUOWQ\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "UOWQ\u6846\u67b6\u65e2\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u53c8\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6e90\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd"}}

Despite their pivotal role in maintaining and improving site performance, CSOs have been largely overlooked by existing reporting standards. In this paper, we propose a suite of readily computable, actionable performance metrics-Fault Time, Fault-Reason Time, and Unreachable Time-that decompose charger behavior into operationally meaningful states. Unlike traditional uptime, these metrics are defined over configurable periods and distinguish between hardware malfunctions and network connectivity issues. We demonstrate the implementation of these metrics via an open-source tool that derives performance data from existing infrastructure without requiring hardware modifications.

The purpose of this work is to continue this tradition in the contemporary era, characterized by the presence of quantum computers, classical supercomputers, and increasingly sophisticated artificial intelligence. We introduce Z-Sigil, an asymmetric public-key cryptographic algorithm grounded in functional analysis, differential geometry, and algebraic topology, with the explicit goal of achieving resistance against both classical and quantum attacks. The construction operates over the tangent fiber bundle of a compact Calabi-Yau manifold [13], where cryptographic keys are elements of vector tangent fibers, with a binary operation defined on tangent spaces of the base manifold giving rise to a groupoid structure. Encryption and decryption are performed iteratively on message blocks, enforcing a serial architecture designed to limit quantum parallelism [9,10]. Each block depends on secret geometric and analytic data, including a randomly chosen base point on the manifold, a selected section of the tangent fiber bundle, and auxiliary analytic data derived from operator determinants and Zeta function regularization [11].

This problem addresses linear dynamical systems subject to signal bound disturbances, i.e., disturbance sequences whose squared signal two-norm is bounded by a fixed budget. The term generalized indicates that the results accommodate arbitrary initial states. By combining game theory and dynamic programming, we derive a recursive solution for the optimal state feedback policy valid for arbitrary initial states. The optimal policy is nonlinear in the state and requires solving a tractable convex scalar optimization for the Lagrange multiplier at each stage; the control is then explicit. For fixed disturbance budget $\u03b1$, the state space partitions into two distinct regions: $\\mathcal{X}_L(\u03b1)$, where the optimal control policy is linear and coincides with the standard linear $H_{\\infty}$ state feedback control, and $\\mathcal{X}_{NL}(\u03b1)$, where the optimal control policy is nonlinear. We establish monotonicity and boundedness of the associated Riccati recursions and characterize the geometry of the solution regions. A numerical example illustrates the theoretical properties.\n  This work provides a complete feedback solution to the finite horizon SiDAR for arbitrary initial states.

However, standard NNs are generally trained in a noiseless environment, creating a mismatch with the noisy channels during edge deployment. In this paper, we address this issue by characterizing the channel-induced performance deterioration as a generalization error against unseen channels. We introduce an augmented NN model that incorporates channel statistics directly into the weight space, allowing us to derive PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds that explicitly quantifies the impact of wireless distortion. We further provide closed-form expressions for practical channels to demonstrate the tractability of these bounds. Inspired by the theoretical results, we propose a channel-aware training algorithm that minimizes a surrogate objective based on the derived bound.

An Exploratory Study", "comment": null, "summary": "As robotics become increasingly integrated into construction workflows, their ability to interpret and respond to human behavior will be essential for enabling safe and effective collaboration. Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising tool for visual understanding tasks and offer the potential to recognize human behaviors without extensive domain-specific training. This capability makes them particularly appealing in the construction domain, where labeled data is scarce and monitoring worker actions and emotional states is critical for safety and productivity. In this study, we evaluate the performance of three leading VLMs, GPT-4o, Florence 2, and LLaVa-1.5, in detecting construction worker actions and emotions from static site images. Using a curated dataset of 1,000 images annotated across ten action and ten emotion categories, we assess each model's outputs through standardized inference pipelines and multiple evaluation metrics. GPT-4o consistently achieved the highest scores across both tasks, with an average F1-score of 0.756 and accuracy of 0.799 in action recognition, and an F1-score of 0.712 and accuracy of 0.773 in emotion recognition. Florence 2 performed moderately, with F1-scores of 0.497 for action and 0.414 for emotion, while LLaVa-1.5 showed the lowest overall performance, with F1-scores of 0.466 for action and 0.461 for emotion. Confusion matrix analyses revealed that all models struggled to distinguish semantically close categories, such as collaborating in teams versus communicating with supervisors. While the results indicate that general-purpose VLMs can offer a baseline capability for human behavior recognition in construction environments, further improvements, such as domain adaptation, temporal modeling, or multimodal sensing, may be needed for real-world reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Results for a variety of such empirical output distributions of good codes have been known in the literature, such as the comparison of the output distribution of the code to the optimal output distribution in vanishing and non-vanishing error probability cases. Motivated by these, we aim to achieve similar results for the quantum codes that are used for classical communication, that is the setting in which the classical messages are communicated through quantum codewords that pass through a noisy quantum channel. We first show the uniqueness of the optimal output distribution, to be able to talk more concretely about the optimal output distribution. Then, we extend the vanishing error probability results to the quantum case, by using techniques that are close in spirit to the classical case.

Building on the finite horizon recursive solution developed in a companion paper, we introduce the steady-state SiDAR and derive its tractable linear matrix inequality (LMI) with $O(n^3)$ complexity. Systems are classified as degenerate or nondegenerate based on steady-state solution properties. For nondegenerate systems, the finite horizon solution converges to the steady-state solution for all states as the horizon approaches infinity. For degenerate systems, convergence holds in one region of the state space, while a turnpike arises in the complementary region. When convergence holds, the optimal multiplier and control gain are obtained directly from the LMI solution. Numerical examples illustrate convergence behavior and turnpike phenomena.\n  Companion papers address the finite horizon SiDAR solution and the stage bound disturbance attenuation regulator (StDAR).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u4fe1\u53f7\u6709\u754c\u6270\u52a8\u8870\u51cf\u8c03\u8282\u5668\uff08SiDAR\uff09\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6536\u655b\u6027\u548c\u7a33\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5177\u6709O(n\u00b3)\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u53ef\u6c42\u89e3\u7ebf\u6027\u77e9\u9635\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff08LMI\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u9000\u5316\u4e0e\u975e\u9000\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u8bf4\u660e\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u4e58\u5b50\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u589e\u76ca\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u4e0a\u4e00\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u4e2d\u5df2\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u57df\u9012\u5f52\u89e3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76SiDAR\u7684\u7a33\u6001\u6027\u8d28\u548c\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u660e\u786e\u9000\u5316\u4e0e\u975e\u9000\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u63a7\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u57df\u9012\u5f52\u89e3\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u7a33\u6001SiDAR\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u53ef\u6c42\u89e3\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u77e9\u9635\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff08LMI\uff09\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u7a33\u6001\u89e3\u7279\u6027\u5c06\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u4e3a\u9000\u5316\u4e0e\u975e\u9000\u5316\u4e24\u7c7b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u6536\u655b\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u975e\u9000\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u57df\u89e3\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u72b6\u6001\u90fd\u6536\u655b\u5230\u7a33\u6001\u89e3\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u9000\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e00\u90e8\u5206\u533a\u57df\u6536\u655b\uff0c\u5728\u4e92\u8865\u533a\u57df\u51fa\u73b0\u8f6c\u5411\u8f6e\u73b0\u8c61\u3002\u6536\u655b\u65f6\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u4eceLMI\u89e3\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u4f18\u4e58\u5b50\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7a33\u6001SiDAR\u5177\u6709\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u884c\u7684LMI\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u660e\u786e\u533a\u5206\u9000\u5316\u4e0e\u975e\u9000\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6536\u655b\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u7279\u6027\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

We address these challenges with a planner-guided, constrained-topology multi-agent framework that generates code for repositories in a multi-step fashion. The LLM-powered planner leverages a team's environment, represented as a graph, to orchestrate calls to available agents, generate context-aware prompts, and use downstream failures to retroactively correct upstream artifacts. It can request human intervention at critical steps, ensuring generated code is reliable, maintainable, and aligned with team expectations. On a novel in-house dataset, our approach achieves 38% and 150% improvement in the evaluation metric over manually crafted and unplanned workflows respectively.

While yielding substantial performance gains, this diversification fundamentally compromises the coordination stability intrinsic to unified agent systems, which causes severe inter-layer conflicts, unbounded error propagation, and restricted scalability. To address these challenges, we propose Constrained Temporal Hierarchical Architecture (CTHA), a general framework that projects the inter-layer communication space onto structured manifolds to restore coordination stability, while incorporating principled arbitration mechanisms to ensure coherent decision-making. Specifically, CTHA enforces three key constraints: (1) Message Contract Constraints that formalize information flow between layers via typed summary, plan, and policy packets; (2) Authority Manifold Constraints that bound each layer's decision space according to its temporal scope; and (3) Arbiter Resolution Constraints that guarantee conflict-free composition of multi-layer decisions. Empirical experiments demonstrate that CTHA is effective for complex task execution at scale, offering 47% reduction in failure cascades, 2.3x improvement in sample efficiency, and superior scalability compared to unconstrained hierarchical baselines. We anticipate that CTHA, as a principled extension of temporal hierarchies, will contribute to a deeper understanding of multi-agent coordination and suggest promising directions for the evolution of robust autonomous systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Despite steady advances in OOD detectors, their interplay with modern training pipelines that maximize in-distribution (ID) accuracy and generalization remains under-explored. We investigate this link through a comprehensive empirical study. Fixing the architecture to the widely adopted ResNet-50, we benchmark 21 post-hoc, state-of-the-art OOD detection methods across 56 ImageNet-trained models obtained via diverse training strategies and evaluate them on eight OOD test sets. Contrary to the common assumption that higher ID accuracy implies better OOD detection performance, we uncover a non-monotonic relationship: OOD performance initially improves with accuracy but declines once advanced training recipes push accuracy beyond the baseline. Moreover, we observe a strong interdependence between training strategy, detector choice, and resulting OOD performance, indicating that no single method is universally optimal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc756\u4e2a\u7528\u4e0d\u540c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u83b7\u5f97\u7684ImageNet\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57288\u4e2aOOD\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf921\u79cd\u6700\u65b0\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0ID\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0eOOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u5173\u7cfb", "motivation": "OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u5bf9\u5f00\u653e\u4e16\u754c\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u90e8\u7f72\u7a33\u5065\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4e0d\u65ad\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u4f46\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u6700\u5927\u5316ID\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u7684\u73b0\u4ee3\u8bad\u7ec3\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u4ecd\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cdOOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u56fa\u5b9a\u4f7f\u7528ResNet-50\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6837\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u83b7\u5f9756\u4e2aImageNet\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u57288\u4e2aOOD\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf921\u79cd\u540e\u5904\u7406\u3001\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684OOD\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "1.

This problem addresses linear dynamical systems subject to stage bound disturbances, i.e., disturbance sequences constrained independently at each time step through stagewise squared two-norm bounds. The term generalized indicates that the results accommodate arbitrary initial states. By combining game theory and dynamic programming, this work derives a recursive solution for the optimal state feedback policy. The optimal policy is nonlinear in the state and requires solving a tractable convex optimization for the Lagrange multiplier vector at each stage; the control is then explicit. For systems with constant stage bound, the problem admits a steady-state optimization expressed as a tractable linear matrix inequality (LMI) with $O(n^3)$ complexity. Numerical examples illustrate the properties of the solution.\n  This work provides a complete feedback solution to the StDAR for arbitrary initial states.

In the AEDS, a data sequence $\\bm{s}=s_1s_2\\cdots s_n$ is encoded in backward order $s_t, t=n, \\cdots, 2,1$, while $\\bm{s}$ is decoded in forward order $s_t, t=1, 2, \\cdots, n$ in the same way as the tANS. But, the code class of the AEDS is much broader than that of the tANS. We show for i.i.d.~sources that an AEDS with 2 states (resp.~5 states) can attain a shorter average code length than the Huffman code if a child of the root in the Huffman code tree has a probability weight larger than 0.61803 (resp.~0.56984). Furthermore, we derive several upper bounds on the average code length of the AEDS, which also hold for the tANS, and we show that the average code length of the optimal AEDS and tANS with $N$ states converges to the source entropy with speed $O(1/N)$ as $N$ increases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u79f0\u4e3a\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u7f16\u7801\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff08AEDS\uff09\u7684\u65e0\u635f\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6848\u662ftANS\uff08\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u6570\u5b57\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8868\u683c\u53d8\u4f53\uff09\u7684\u63a8\u5e7f\u3002AEDS\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u65f6\u4ee5\u9006\u5e8f\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u65f6\u4ee5\u6b63\u5e8f\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u4e14\u5176\u7f16\u7801\u7c7b\u522b\u6bd4tANS\u5e7f\u6cdb\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728i.i.d.\u6e90\u4e0b\uff0c\u5177\u67092\u4e2a\u72b6\u6001\uff08\u62165\u4e2a\u72b6\u6001\uff09\u7684AEDS\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u4ee5\u6bd4\u54c8\u592b\u66fc\u7f16\u7801\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u77ed\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7801\u957f\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86AEDS\u548ctANS\u5e73\u5747\u7801\u957f\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u5f53\u72b6\u6001\u6570N\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\uff0c\u6700\u4f18AEDS\u548ctANS\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7801\u957f\u4ee5O(1/N)\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u6536\u655b\u5230\u6e90\u71b5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709tANS\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u5b58\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u7c7b\u522b\u8f83\u7a84\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u5e0c\u671b\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u7684\u65e0\u635f\u6570\u636e\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6848\u6765\u6269\u5c55tANS\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u54c8\u592b\u66fc\u7f16\u7801\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\u975e\u5bf9\u79f0\u7f16\u7801\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6848\uff08AEDS\uff09\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u7f16\u7801\u65f6\u4ee5\u9006\u5e8f\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\uff08\u4ece\u672b\u5c3e\u5230\u5f00\u5934\uff09\uff0c\u89e3\u7801\u65f6\u4ee5\u6b63\u5e8f\u5904\u7406\uff08\u4ece\u5f00\u5934\u5230\u672b\u5c3e\uff09\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u79fb\u548c\u7f16\u7801/\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u4e86tANS\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u7c7b\u522b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9i.i.d.\u6e90\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51faAEDS\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7801\u957f\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5176\u4e0e\u54c8\u592b\u66fc\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "AEDS\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u7c7b\u522b\u6bd4tANS\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u3002\u5728i.i.d.\u6e90\u4e0b\uff0c2\u72b6\u6001\u7684AEDS\u5728\u54c8\u592b\u66fc\u7f16\u7801\u6811\u6839\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u67d0\u4e2a\u5b50\u8282\u70b9\u6982\u7387\u6743\u91cd\u5927\u4e8e0.61803\u65f6\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6bd4\u54c8\u592b\u66fc\u7f16\u7801\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u77ed\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7801\u957f\uff1b5\u72b6\u6001AEDS\u7684\u76f8\u5e94\u9608\u503c\u4e3a0.56984\u3002\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86AEDS\uff08\u4e5f\u5305\u62ectANS\uff09\u5e73\u5747\u7801\u957f\u7684\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6700\u4f18AEDS\u548ctANS\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7801\u957f\u4ee5O(1/N)\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u6536\u655b\u5230\u6e90\u71b5\u3002", "conclusion": "AEDS\u4f5c\u4e3atANS\u7684\u63a8\u5e7f\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u4e8e\u54c8\u592b\u66fc\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u72b6\u6001\u6570N\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6700\u4f18AEDS\u548ctANS\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7801\u957f\u53ef\u4ee5\u5feb\u901f\u6536\u655b\u5230\u6e90\u71b5\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u65e0\u635f\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In transformer based large language models (LLMs), there exist more sophisticated operations beyond activation-weight GEMM. In this paper, we explore how VLP benefits LLMs. First, we generalize VLP for nonlinear approximations, outperforming existing nonlinear approximations in end-to-end LLM accuracy, performance, and efficiency. Our VLP approximation follows a value-centric approach, where important values are assigned with greater accuracy. Second, we optimize VLP for small-batch GEMMs with asymmetric inputs efficiently, which leverages timely LLM optimizations, including weight-only quantization, key-value (KV) cache quantization, and group query attention. Finally, we design a new VLP architecture, Mugi, to encapsulate the innovations above and support full LLM workloads, while providing better performance, efficiency and sustainability. Our experimental results show that Mugi can offer significant improvements on throughput and energy efficiency, up to $45\\times$ and $668\\times$ for nonlinear softmax operations, and $2.07\\times$ and $3.11\\times$ for LLMs, and also decrease operational carbon for LLM operation by $1.45\\times$ and embodied carbon by $1.48\\times$.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u7ea7\u5e76\u884c\u67b6\u6784Mugi\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u903c\u8fd1\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5c0f\u6279\u91cfGEMM\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86LLM\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u3001\u80fd\u6548\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfVLP\uff08\u4ef7\u503c\u7ea7\u5e76\u884c\uff09\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u4f4e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u901a\u7528\u77e9\u9635\u4e58\u6cd5\uff08GEMM\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u5c06VLP\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eLLM\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c06VLP\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u903c\u8fd1\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b2. \u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u5c0f\u6279\u91cfGEMM\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6743\u91cd\u91cf\u5316\u3001KV\u7f13\u5b58\u91cf\u5316\u7b49\u6280\u672f\uff1b3. \u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7684VLP\u67b6\u6784Mugi\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b8c\u6574\u7684LLM\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3002", "result": "Mugi\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027softmax\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe45\u500d\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c668\u500d\u80fd\u6548\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728LLM\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b02.07\u500d\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c3.11\u500d\u80fd\u6548\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5c06\u8fd0\u8425\u78b3\u6392\u653e\u964d\u4f4e1.45\u500d\uff0c\u5d4c\u78b3\u964d\u4f4e1.48\u500d\u3002", "conclusion": "Mugi\u67b6\u6784\u901a\u8fc7\u4ef7\u503c\u7ea7\u5e76\u884c\u521b\u65b0\uff0c\u4e3aLLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86VLP\u5728\u590d\u6742Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Achieving this goal, however, depends on prior knowledge of spatial-temporal variations in wireless channels and traffic demands. This motivates a joint, site-specific representation of radio propagation and user demand that is queryable at low online overhead. In this work, we propose the perception embedding map (PEM), a localized framework that embeds fine-grained channel statistics together with grid-level spatial-temporal traffic patterns over a base station's coverage. PEM is built from standard-compliant measurements -- such as measurement report and scheduling/quality-of-service logs -- so it can be deployed and maintained at scale with low cost. Integrated into PEM, this joint knowledge supports enhanced environment-aware optimization across PHY, MAC, and network layers while substantially reducing training overhead and signaling. Compared with existing site-specific channel maps and digital-twin replicas, PEM distinctively emphasizes (i) joint channel-traffic embedding, which is essential for network optimization, and (ii) practical construction using standard measurements, enabling network autonomy while striking a favorable fidelity-cost balance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, widespread use is hindered by high computational times and a black-box nature that inhibits user interaction. Human-in-the-loop TO approaches are emerging that integrate human intuition into the design generation process. However, these rely on the time-consuming bottleneck of iterative region selection for design modifications. To reduce the number of iterative trials, this contribution presents an AI co-pilot that uses machine learning to predict the user's preferred regions. The prediction model is configured as an image segmentation task with a U-Net architecture. It is trained on synthetic datasets where human preferences either identify the longest topological member or the most complex structural connection. The model successfully predicts plausible regions for modification and presents them to the user as AI recommendations. The human preference model demonstrates generalization across diverse and non-standard TO problems and exhibits emergent behavior outside the single-region selection training data.

However, their direct applicability to medical image segmentation remains limited by severe domain shifts, the absence of privileged spatial prompts, and the need to reason over complex anatomical and volumetric structures. Here we present Medical SAM3, a foundation model for universal prompt-driven medical image segmentation, obtained by fully fine-tuning SAM3 on large-scale, heterogeneous 2D and 3D medical imaging datasets with paired segmentation masks and text prompts. Through a systematic analysis of vanilla SAM3, we observe that its performance degrades substantially on medical data, with its apparent competitiveness largely relying on strong geometric priors such as ground-truth-derived bounding boxes. These findings motivate full model adaptation beyond prompt engineering alone. By fine-tuning SAM3's model parameters on 33 datasets spanning 10 medical imaging modalities, Medical SAM3 acquires robust domain-specific representations while preserving prompt-driven flexibility. Extensive experiments across organs, imaging modalities, and dimensionalities demonstrate consistent and significant performance gains, particularly in challenging scenarios characterized by semantic ambiguity, complex morphology, and long-range 3D context. Our results establish Medical SAM3 as a universal, text-guided segmentation foundation model for medical imaging and highlight the importance of holistic model adaptation for achieving robust prompt-driven segmentation under severe domain shift.

Here, we introduce a universal, monolithic photolithography process that enables high-yield, high-resolution stretchable complementary OFETs and circuits. This approach is enabled by a process-design framework that includes (i) a direct, photopatternable, solvent-resistant, crosslinked dielectric/semiconductor interface, (ii) broadly applicable crosslinked PSC blends that preserve high mobility, and (iii) a patterning strategy that provides simultaneous etch masking and encapsulation. Using this platform, we achieve record integration density for stretchable OTFTs (55,000 cm^-2), channel lengths down to 2 um, and low-voltage operation at 5 V. We demonstrate photopatterning across multiple PSC types and realize complementary circuits, including 3 kHz stretchable ring oscillators, the first to exceed 1 kHz and representing more than a 60-fold increase in stage switching speed over the state of the art.

The ARC Prize 2025 global competition targeted the newly released ARC-AGI-2 dataset, which features greater task complexity compared to its predecessor. The Kaggle competition attracted 1,455 teams and 15,154 entries, with the top score reaching 24% on the ARC-AGI-2 private evaluation set. Paper submissions nearly doubled year-over-year to 90 entries, reflecting the growing research interest in fluid intelligence and abstract reasoning. The defining theme of 2025 is the emergence of the refinement loop -- a per-task iterative program optimization loop guided by a feedback signal. Refinement loops come in a variety of forms, in particular evolutionary program synthesis approaches and application-layer refinements to commercial AI systems. Such refinement loops are also possible in weight space, as evidenced by zero-pretraining deep learning methods which are now achieving competitive performance with remarkably small networks (7M parameters). In parallel, four frontier AI labs (Anthropic, Google DeepMind, OpenAI, and xAI) reported ARC-AGI performance in public model cards in 2025, establishing ARC-AGI as an industry standard benchmark for AI reasoning. However, our analysis indicates that current frontier AI reasoning performance remains fundamentally constrained to knowledge coverage, giving rise to new forms of benchmark contamination. In this paper, we survey the top-performing methods, examine the role of refinement loops in AGI progress, discuss knowledge-dependent overfitting, and preview ARC-AGI-3, which introduces interactive reasoning challenges that require exploration, planning, memory, goal acquisition, and alignment capabilities.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This limits their controllability over individual body parts. In this work, we construct a high-quality motion dataset with atomic, temporally-aware part-level text annotations, leveraging the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike prior datasets that either provide synchronized part captions with fixed time segments or rely solely on global sequence labels, our dataset captures asynchronous and semantically distinct part movements at fine temporal resolution. Based on this dataset, we introduce a diffusion-based part-aware motion generation framework, namely FrankenMotion, where each body part is guided by its own temporally-structured textual prompt. This is, to our knowledge, the first work to provide atomic, temporally-aware part-level motion annotations and have a model that allows motion generation with both spatial (body part) and temporal (atomic action) control.

However, conventional operating strategies maintain conservatively low chilled water temperatures throughout the cooling season, a practice that results in suboptimal heat pump performance. This study proposes a physics-based integrated simulation framework to determine the maximum feasible chilled water supply temperature while ensuring cooling stability. The framework integrates four submodels: relative humidity prediction, dynamic cooling load estimation, cooling coil performance prediction, and TES discharge temperature prediction. Validation against measured data from an office building demonstrates reliable accuracy across all sub-models (e.g., CVRMSE of 9.3% for cooling load and R2 of 0.91 for peak-time discharge temperature). The integrated simulation reveals that the proposed framework can increase the daily initial TES charging temperature by an average of 2.55 \u00b0C compared to conventional fixed-temperature operation, enabling the heat pump to operate at a higher coefficient of performance.

While solution concepts and analytical tools for existence and completeness are well established for autonomous hybrid systems, corresponding results for hybrid dynamical systems involving continuous-time inputs are generally lacking. This work aims to address this gap. We first formalize notions of a solution for such systems. We then provide conditions that guarantee the existence and forward completeness of solutions. Moreover, we leverage results and ideas from viability theory to present more explicit conditions in terms of various tangent cone formulations.

The optimal trade-off is shown to be governed by a mutual information term involving common information and two conditional rate-distortion-perception functions. The perception constraint requires that the distribution of each reproduced sequence is close to that of the original source sequence, which is motivated by practical applications in image and video compression. Prior studies usually focus on the compression and reconstruction of a single source sequence. In this paper, we generalize the prior results for point-to-point systems to the representative multi-terminal setting of the Gray-Wyner problem with two correlated source sequences. In particular, we integrate the analyses of the distortion and the perception constraints by including the random circular shift operator in the encoding and decoding process directly.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5728Gray-Wyner\u6709\u635f\u4fe1\u6e90\u7f16\u7801\u95ee\u9898\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u52a0\u5165\u611f\u77e5\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e24\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u6e90\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7387-\u5931\u771f-\u611f\u77e5\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u968f\u673a\u5faa\u73af\u79fb\u4f4d\u7b97\u5b50\u5728\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u5931\u771f\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u7ea6\u675f", "motivation": "\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u538b\u7f29\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u5efa\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u4fe1\u6e90\u5206\u5e03\u76f8\u8fd1\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u4fe1\u6e90\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u4e0e\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u5c06\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u591a\u7ec8\u7aefGray-Wyner\u573a\u666f", "method": "\u5c06\u968f\u673a\u5faa\u73af\u79fb\u4f4d\u7b97\u5b50\u76f4\u63a5\u6574\u5408\u5230\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u89e3\u7801\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u6790\u5931\u771f\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7531\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u9879\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u6761\u4ef6\u7387-\u5931\u771f-\u611f\u77e5\u51fd\u6570\u51b3\u5b9a\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb", "result": "\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u4e00\u9636\u6e10\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u7387-\u5931\u771f-\u611f\u77e5\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u8861\u7531\u5171\u540c\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u9879\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u6761\u4ef6\u7387-\u5931\u771f-\u611f\u77e5\u51fd\u6570\u51b3\u5b9a", "conclusion": "\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u5355\u4fe1\u6e90\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7387-\u5931\u771f-\u611f\u77e5\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u591a\u7ec8\u7aefGray-Wyner\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u6e90\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u6709\u635f\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6"}}

In this context, we introduce Action Shapley as an agnostic metric for the judicious and unbiased selection of training data.

A full order observer based feedback control framework is developed to estimate system states and compensate for external disturbances during the trajectory correction phase following main engine cut off. The maneuver trajectory is generated using Lambert guidance, while the observer based controller ensures accurate tracking of the target orbit despite SRP perturbations. The effectiveness of the proposed design is assessed through stability, observability, and controllability analyses. Stability is validated by step-response simulations and eigenvalue distributions of the system dynamics. Observability is demonstrated through state matrix rank analysis, confirming complete state estimation. Controllability is verified using state feedback rank conditions and corresponding control performance plots. Comparative simulations highlight that, in contrast to uncontrolled or conventional control cases, the observer based controller achieves improved trajectory accuracy and robust disturbance rejection with moderate control effort.

Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) establishes reflective paths to bypass obstacles, but suffers from angular mismatch when deployed in the side-lobe region of base station (BS) antennas. To address this issue, we propose a new RA-enabled IRS-assisted multi-user uplink system, in which the BS antennas are capable of flexibly adjusting their 3D orientations to align their boresights with the IRS. We formulate a sum rate maximization problem by jointly optimizing the antenna 3D rotations, receive beamforming and IRS phase shifts. To tackle this non-convex problem, we propose an efficient alternating optimization (AO) algorithm. Specifically, we iteratively update the antenna rotations via projected gradient ascent (PGA), compute the receive beamforming via a closed-form solution, and optimize the IRS phase shifts via fractional programming (FP). Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed system yields significant performance gains over conventional fixed-antenna systems, especially under large angular misalignments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u65cb\u8f6c\u5929\u7ebf(RA)\u4f7f\u80fd\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u53cd\u5c04\u9762(IRS)\u8f85\u52a9\u591a\u7528\u6237\u4e0a\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5929\u7ebf3D\u65cb\u8f6c\u3001\u63a5\u6536\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u548cIRS\u76f8\u4f4d\u504f\u79fb\u6765\u6700\u5927\u5316\u548c\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u56fa\u5b9a\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u65cb\u8f6c\u5929\u7ebf\u867d\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u589e\u76ca\u589e\u5f3a\u65e0\u7ebf\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u4f46\u6613\u53d7\u7269\u7406\u963b\u6321\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd\uff1b\u667a\u80fd\u53cd\u5c04\u9762\u867d\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u5c04\u8def\u5f84\u7ed5\u8fc7\u969c\u788d\u7269\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u57fa\u7ad9\u5929\u7ebf\u65c1\u74e3\u533a\u57df\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u89d2\u5ea6\u5931\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRA\u4f7f\u80fd\u7684IRS\u8f85\u52a9\u591a\u7528\u6237\u4e0a\u884c\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u57fa\u7ad9\u5929\u7ebf\u80fd\u7075\u6d3b\u8c03\u65743D\u65b9\u5411\u4f7f\u5176\u6ce2\u675f\u5bf9\u51c6IRS\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a\u7528\u6295\u5f71\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u66f4\u65b0\u5929\u7ebf\u65cb\u8f6c\uff0c\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u8ba1\u7b97\u63a5\u6536\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\uff0c\u5206\u6570\u89c4\u5212\u4f18\u5316IRS\u76f8\u4f4d\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u56fa\u5b9a\u5929\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u5927\u7684\u89d2\u5ea6\u5931\u914d\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u5929\u7ebf3D\u65cb\u8f6c\u3001\u63a5\u6536\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u548cIRS\u76f8\u4f4d\u504f\u79fb\uff0cRA\u4f7f\u80fd\u7684IRS\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u514b\u670d\u7269\u7406\u963b\u6321\u548c\u89d2\u5ea6\u5931\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e0a\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Traditional vessel navigation heavily relies on human experience, often lacking autonomy and emission awareness, and is prone to human errors that may compromise safety. In this paper, we propose a Curriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) framework integrated with a realistic, data-driven marine simulation environment and a machine learning-based fuel consumption prediction module. The simulation environment is constructed using real-world vessel movement data and enhanced with a Diffusion Model to simulate dynamic maritime conditions. Vessel fuel consumption is estimated using historical operational data and learning-based regression. The surrounding environment is represented as image-based inputs to capture spatial complexity. We design a lightweight, policy-based CRL agent with a comprehensive reward mechanism that considers safety, emissions, timeliness, and goal completion. This framework effectively handles complex tasks progressively while ensuring stable and efficient learning in continuous action spaces.

Prior sequence-based optimization methods struggle with the high-dimensional complexities due to the epistasis effect and the disregard for structural constraints. To address this, we propose HADES, a Bayesian optimization method utilizing Hamiltonian dynamics to efficiently sample from a structure-aware approximated posterior. Leveraging momentum and uncertainty in the simulated physical movements, HADES enables rapid transition of proposals toward promising areas. A position discretization procedure is introduced to propose discrete protein sequences from such a continuous state system. The posterior surrogate is powered by a two-stage encoder-decoder framework to determine the structure and function relationships between mutant neighbors, consequently learning a smoothed landscape to sample from. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in in-silico evaluations across most metrics. Remarkably, our approach offers a unique advantage by leveraging the mutual constraints between protein structure and sequence, facilitating the design of protein sequences with similar structures and optimized properties.

Our framework enables adaptive specialization based on input characteristics, improving robustness across diverse real-world conditions.

While ConvLSTM2D is a commonly used baseline, its dense convolutional gating incurs high computational cost and its strictly local receptive fields limit the modeling of long-range spatial structure and disentangled climate dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose FAConvLSTM, a Factorized-Attention ConvLSTM layer designed as a drop-in replacement for ConvLSTM2D that simultaneously improves efficiency, spatial expressiveness, and physical interpretability. FAConvLSTM factorizes recurrent gate computations using lightweight [1 times 1] bottlenecks and shared depthwise spatial mixing, substantially reducing channel complexity while preserving recurrent dynamics. Multi-scale dilated depthwise branches and squeeze-and-excitation recalibration enable efficient modeling of interacting physical processes across spatial scales, while peephole connections enhance temporal precision. To capture teleconnection-scale dependencies without incurring global attention cost, FAConvLSTM incorporates a lightweight axial spatial attention mechanism applied sparsely in time. A dedicated subspace head further produces compact per timestep embeddings refined through temporal self-attention with fixed seasonal positional encoding. Experiments on multivariate spatiotemporal climate data shows superiority demonstrating that FAConvLSTM yields more stable, interpretable, and robust latent representations than standard ConvLSTM, while significantly reducing computational overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FAConvLSTM\uff08\u56e0\u5f0f\u5316\u6ce8\u610f\u529bConvLSTM\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3aConvLSTM2D\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6539\u8fdb\u7ed3\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u5730\u7403\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfConvLSTM\u5728\u5904\u7406\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u591a\u5143\u5730\u7403\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u5c40\u90e8\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u9650\u5236\u957f\u7a0b\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u8026\u6c14\u5019\u52a8\u6001\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u7269\u7406\u610f\u4e49\u660e\u786e\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "FAConvLSTM\u91c7\u7528\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u95e8\u63a7\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea71\u00d71\u74f6\u9888\u548c\u5171\u4eab\u6df1\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u6df7\u5408\uff09\u3001\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6269\u5f20\u6df1\u5ea6\u5206\u652f\u3001\u6324\u538b-\u6fc0\u52b1\u91cd\u6821\u51c6\u3001\u7aa5\u5b54\u8fde\u63a5\u3001\u8f7b\u91cf\u8f74\u5411\u7a7a\u95f4\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff08\u65f6\u95f4\u7a00\u758f\u5e94\u7528\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e13\u7528\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u5934\u914d\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u540c\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u8fbe\u548c\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u5143\u65f6\u7a7a\u6c14\u5019\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cFAConvLSTM\u6bd4\u6807\u51c6ConvLSTM\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "conclusion": "FAConvLSTM\u4f5c\u4e3aConvLSTM2D\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u66ff\u6362\u5c42\uff0c\u5728\u6548\u7387\u3001\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7269\u7406\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u540c\u6b65\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3a\u5730\u7403\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Simulating real-life data annotation scarcity, the Solafune Tree Canopy Detection competition provides a small and imbalanced dataset of only 150 annotated images, posing significant challenges for training deep models without severe overfitting. In this work, we evaluate five representative architectures, YOLOv11, Mask R-CNN, DeepLabv3, Swin-UNet, and DINOv2, to assess their suitability for canopy segmentation under extreme data scarcity. Our experiments show that pretrained convolution-based models, particularly YOLOv11 and Mask R-CNN, generalize significantly better than pretrained transformer-based models. DeeplabV3, Swin-UNet and DINOv2 underperform likely due to differences between semantic and instance segmentation tasks, the high data requirements of Vision Transformers, and the lack of strong inductive biases. These findings confirm that transformer-based architectures struggle in low-data regimes without substantial pretraining or augmentation and that differences between semantic and instance segmentation further affect model performance. We provide a detailed analysis of training strategies, augmentation policies, and model behavior under the small-data constraint and demonstrate that lightweight CNN-based methods remain the most reliable for canopy detection on limited imagery.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This leads to the widely used multi-code architecture in the standard, significantly increasing the hardware complexity since multiple decoders are required in each piece of equipment. A universal decoding framework based on polar transformations has recently been proposed to unify BLBC decoding under polar-style decoders, but its parallelization has not yet been discussed. In this work, we propose Polar Orbit Decoding (POD), a universal parallel decoding framework for BLBCs. We identify that the automorphisms of BLBCs generate an orbit of permutations that induce diverse decoding trajectories with identical dynamic-frozen constraints after the polar transformations. By decoding over this automorphism orbit in parallel, POD achieves substantial latency-performance tradeoffs without requiring frozen-set readaptation or extra exhaustive permutation searches. Moreover, to enable efficient orbit traversal in the implementation, we represent the automorphism group in a base and strong generating set (BSGS) form using Schreier-Sims algorithms, making offline systematic computation accessible in polynomial time. Simulation results on extended BCH and extended Golay codes demonstrate that POD can achieve maximum-likelihood performance while significantly reducing the decoding latency compared to conventional successive cancellation list decoding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faPolar Orbit Decoding\uff08POD\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7ec4\u7801\u7684\u901a\u7528\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u7801\u7684\u81ea\u540c\u6784\u7fa4\u751f\u6210\u7f6e\u6362\u8f68\u9053\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u5728\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u7801\u67b6\u6784\u9700\u8981\u591a\u4e2a\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u786c\u4ef6\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff1b\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6781\u5750\u6807\u53d8\u6362\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6\u867d\u80fd\u7b80\u5316\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e94\u7528\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "POD\u5229\u7528\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7ec4\u7801\u7684\u81ea\u540c\u6784\u7fa4\u751f\u6210\u7f6e\u6362\u8f68\u9053\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f6e\u6362\u5728\u6781\u5750\u6807\u53d8\u6362\u540e\u4ea7\u751f\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u52a8\u6001\u51bb\u7ed3\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u8be5\u8f68\u9053\u4e0a\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u9002\u914d\u51bb\u7ed3\u96c6\u6216\u8fdb\u884c\u7a77\u4e3e\u7f6e\u6362\u641c\u7d22\u3002\u91c7\u7528Schreier-Sims\u7b97\u6cd5\u5c06\u81ea\u540c\u6784\u7fa4\u8868\u793a\u4e3a\u57fa\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u96c6\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6269\u5c55BCH\u7801\u548c\u6269\u5c55Golay\u7801\u4e0a\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u8868\u660e\uff0cPOD\u80fd\u591f\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u5bf9\u6d88\u5217\u8868\u89e3\u7801\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u89e3\u7801\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "POD\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u7ebf\u6027\u5206\u7ec4\u7801\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u89e3\u7801\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u540c\u6784\u8f68\u9053\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u786c\u4ef6\u7b80\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Submitted to WiOpt 2026", "summary": "Split learning (SL) enables collaborative training of large language models (LLMs) between resource-constrained edge devices and compute-rich servers by partitioning model computation across the network boundary. However, existing SL systems predominantly rely on first-order (FO) optimization, which requires clients to store intermediate quantities such as activations for backpropagation. This results in substantial memory overhead, largely negating benefits of model partitioning. In contrast, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization eliminates backpropagation and significantly reduces memory usage, but often suffers from slow convergence and degraded performance. In this work, we propose HOSL, a novel Hybrid-Order Split Learning framework that addresses this fundamental trade-off between memory efficiency and optimization effectiveness by strategically integrating ZO optimization on the client side with FO optimization on the server side. By employing memory-efficient ZO gradient estimation at the client, HOSL eliminates backpropagation and activation storage, reducing client memory consumption. Meanwhile, server-side FO optimization ensures fast convergence and competitive performance. Theoretically, we show that HOSL achieves a $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{d_c/TQ})$ rate, which depends on client-side model dimension $d_c$ rather than the full model dimension $d$, demonstrating that convergence improves as more computation is offloaded to the server. Extensive experiments on OPT models (125M and 1.3B parameters) across 6 tasks demonstrate that HOSL reduces client GPU memory by up to 3.7$\\times$ compared to the FO method while achieving accuracy within 0.20%-4.23% of this baseline. Furthermore, HOSL outperforms the ZO baseline by up to 15.55%, validating the effectiveness of our hybrid strategy for memory-efficient training on edge devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing benchmarks remain focused on single agentic capability, failing to capture long-horizon real-world scenarios. Moreover, the reliance on human-in-the-loop feedback for realistic tasks creates a scalability bottleneck, hindering automated rollout collection and evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgencyBench, a comprehensive benchmark derived from daily AI usage, evaluating 6 core agentic capabilities across 32 real-world scenarios, comprising 138 tasks with specific queries, deliverables, and rubrics. These scenarios require an average of 90 tool calls, 1 million tokens, and hours of execution time to resolve. To enable automated evaluation, we employ a user simulation agent to provide iterative feedback, and a Docker sandbox to conduct visual and functional rubric-based assessment. Experiments reveal that closed-source models significantly outperform open-source models (48.4% vs 32.1%). Further analysis reveals significant disparities across models in resource efficiency, feedback-driven self-correction, and specific tool-use preferences. Finally, we investigate the impact of agentic scaffolds, observing that proprietary models demonstrate superior performance within their native ecosystems (e.g., Claude-4.5-Opus via Claude-Agent-SDK), while open-source models exhibit distinct performance peaks, suggesting potential optimization for specific execution frameworks. AgencyBench serves as a critical testbed for next-generation agents, highlighting the necessity of co-optimizing model architecture with agentic frameworks. We believe this work sheds light on the future direction of autonomous agents, and we release the full benchmark and evaluation toolkit at https://github.com/GAIR-NLP/AgencyBench.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While this has led to notable advancements, the absence of patient-reported symptoms continues to hinder diagnostic accuracy. To address this, we propose a Pre-Consultation Dialogue Framework (PCDF) that mimics real-world diagnostic procedures, where doctors iteratively query patients before reaching a conclusion. Specifically, we simulate diagnostic dialogues between two vision-language models (VLMs): a DocVLM, which generates follow-up questions based on the image and dialogue history, and a PatientVLM, which responds using a symptom profile derived from the ground-truth diagnosis. We additionally conducted a small-scale clinical validation of the synthetic symptoms generated by our framework, with licensed clinicians confirming their clinical relevance, symptom coverage, and overall realism. These findings indicate that the resulting DocVLM-PatientVLM interactions form coherent, multi-turn consultations paired with images and diagnoses, which we then use to fine-tune the DocVLM.

MiCA infers mobility relations through causal discovery and integrates them into temporal forecasting models via gated residual mixing. This design allows lightweight forecasters to selectively exploit mobility-derived spatial structure while remaining robust under noisy and data-limited conditions, without introducing heavy relational components such as graph neural networks or full attention. Extensive experiments on four real-world epidemic datasets, including COVID-19 incidence, COVID-19 mortality, influenza, and dengue, show that MiCA consistently improves lightweight temporal backbones, achieving an average relative error reduction of 7.5\\% across forecasting horizons. Moreover, MiCA attains performance competitive with SOTA spatio-temporal models while remaining lightweight.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Here, by analyzing SGD learning dynamics, we identify a nonequilibrium mechanism governing solution selection. Numerical experiments reveal a transient exploratory phase in which SGD trajectories repeatedly escape sharp valleys and transition toward flatter regions of the loss landscape. By using a tractable physical model, we show that the SGD noise reshapes the landscape into an effective potential that favors flat solutions. Crucially, we uncover a transient freezing mechanism: as training proceeds, growing energy barriers suppress inter-valley transitions and ultimately trap the dynamics within a single basin. Increasing the SGD noise strength delays this freezing, which enhances convergence to flatter minima. Together, these results provide a unified physical framework linking learning dynamics, loss-landscape geometry, and generalization, and suggest principles for the design of more effective optimization algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, most practical agents remain human-designed because tasks differ widely, making them labor-intensive to build. This situation poses a central question: can we automatically create and adapt domain agents in the wild? While several recent approaches have sought to automate agent creation, they typically treat agent generation as a black-box procedure and rely solely on final performance metrics to guide the process. Such strategies overlook critical evidence explaining why an agent succeeds or fails, and often require high computational costs. To address these limitations, we propose ReCreate, an experience-driven framework for the automatic creation of domain agents. ReCreate systematically leverages agent interaction histories, which provide rich concrete signals on both the causes of success or failure and the avenues for improvement. Specifically, we introduce an agent-as-optimizer paradigm that effectively learns from experience via three key components: (i) an experience storage and retrieval mechanism for on-demand inspection; (ii) a reasoning-creating synergy pipeline that maps execution experience into scaffold edits; and (iii) hierarchical updates that abstract instance-level details into reusable domain patterns. In experiments across diverse domains, ReCreate consistently outperforms human-designed agents and existing automated agent generation methods, even when starting from minimal seed scaffolds.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aReCreate\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9a71\u52a8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u521b\u5efa\u9886\u57df\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cReCreate\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u5386\u53f2\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u6210\u529f\u6216\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u591a\u6570\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ecd\u7531\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\u79cd\u7c7b\u7e41\u591a\uff0c\u624b\u5de5\u6784\u5efa\u8017\u8d39\u5927\u91cf\u4eba\u529b\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u4e00\u662f\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u6700\u7ec8\u6027\u80fd\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u6210\u529f\u6216\u5931\u8d25\u539f\u56e0\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8bc1\u636e\uff1b\u4e8c\u662f\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6602\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u8feb\u5207\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5229\u7528\u8fd0\u884c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u3001\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u521b\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ReCreate\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5373\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u3002\u5176\u6838\u5fc3\u5305\u62ec\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5b58\u50a8\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6309\u9700\u68c0\u67e5\u8fc7\u5f80\u4ea4\u4e92\u8bb0\u5f55\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u63a8\u7406-\u521b\u5efa\u534f\u540c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u6267\u884c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u6307\u4ee4\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u66f4\u65b0\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5c06\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u7ec6\u8282\u62bd\u8c61\u4e3a\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u7684\u9886\u57df\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u6574\u4e2a\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf\u521d\u59cb\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u79cd\u5b50\u6846\u67b6\uff09\u51fa\u53d1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5b8c\u6210\u5ea6\u7684\u9886\u57df\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cReCreate\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4ee5\u53ca\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5373\u4f7f\u4ece\u6700\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u79cd\u5b50\u6846\u67b6\u5f00\u59cb\uff0c\u4e5f\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9a71\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "ReCreate\u901a\u8fc7\u7ecf\u9a8c\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u521b\u5efa\u9ad8\u6548\u9886\u57df\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u9ed1\u76d2\u4f18\u5316\u6280\u672f\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u66f4\u52a0\u7ecf\u6d4e\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u751f\u6210\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u9886\u57df\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002"}}

The method is able to remove a wide range of distractors in 3D scenes, such as snowflakes, confetti, defoliation and petals, whereas existing methods usually focus on a specific type of distractors. By incorporating implicit 3D representations with 2D detectors, we demonstrate that it is possible to efficiently restore 3D scenes from multiple corrupted images. We design the learned perceptual image patch similarity~( LPIPS) loss and the multi-view compensation loss (MVCL) to jointly optimize the rendering results of IDDR-NGP, which could aggregate information from multi-view corrupted images. All of them can be trained in an end-to-end manner to synthesize high-quality 3D scenes. To support the research on distractors removal in implicit 3D representations, we build a new benchmark dataset that consists of both synthetic and real-world distractors. To validate the effectiveness and robustness of IDDR-NGP, we provide a wide range of distractors with corresponding annotated labels added to both realistic and synthetic scenes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of IDDR-NGP in removing multiple types of distractors. In addition, our approach achieves results comparable with the existing SOTA desnow methods and is capable of accurately removing both realistic and synthetic distractors.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, two aspects of all-inverter power systems are investigated: greater localization of system disturbance response and greater system controllability. The prevalence of both of these aspects are shown to be related to the lower effective inertia of inverters and have implications for future widearea control system design. Greater disturbance localization implies the need for feedback measurement placement close to generator nodes to properly reject disturbances in the system while increased system controllability implies that widearea control systems should preferentially actuate inverters to most efficiently control the system. This investigation utilizes reduced-order linear time-invariant models of both SGs and inverters that are shown to capture the frequency dynamics of interest in both all-SG and all-inverter systems, allowing for the efficient use of both frequency and time domain analysis methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u5168\u9006\u53d8\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u540c\u6b65\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u9006\u53d8\u5668\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u7b49\u6548\u60ef\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd9\u5e26\u6765\u4e24\u5927\u7279\u5f81\uff1a\u6270\u52a8\u54cd\u5e94\u66f4\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u66f4\u5f3a\uff0c\u5bf9\u5e7f\u57df\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ece\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u540c\u6b65\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u53d1\u7535\u5411\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u529b\u7535\u5b50\u8bbe\u5907\u7684\u53d1\u7535\u65b9\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8003\u8651\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7814\u7a76\u5168\u9006\u53d8\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u964d\u9636\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u4e0d\u53d8\u6a21\u578b\u6765\u5efa\u6a21\u540c\u6b65\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u548c\u9006\u53d8\u5668\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u5168\u540c\u6b65\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u5168\u9006\u53d8\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u611f\u5174\u8da3\u7684\u9891\u7387\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6709\u6548\u5e94\u7528\u9891\u7387\u57df\u548c\u65f6\u57df\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u9006\u53d8\u5668\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u6709\u6548\u60ef\u91cf\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e24\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u7279\u6027\uff1a1) \u6270\u52a8\u54cd\u5e94\u66f4\u52a0\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u53cd\u9988\u6d4b\u91cf\u70b9\u9760\u8fd1\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u8282\u70b9\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u6270\u52a8\uff1b2) \u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5e7f\u57df\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e94\u4f18\u5148\u63a7\u5236\u9006\u53d8\u5668\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5168\u9006\u53d8\u7535\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u540c\u6b65\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u672c\u8d28\u533a\u522b\uff0c\u5176\u6270\u52a8\u54cd\u5e94\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u7279\u6027\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u7684\u5e7f\u57df\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u91c7\u7528\u9760\u8fd1\u53d1\u7535\u673a\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u4f18\u5148\u63a7\u5236\u9006\u53d8\u5668\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

The present work devises coding schemes for the noisy TPC by embedding markers in the transmitted sequence. We investigate the use of static markers and markers connected to the data in the form of hash functions. These two tools have also been recently exploited to tackle the noiseless TPC. Simulations show that static markers excel at higher substitution probabilities, while data-dependent markers are superior at lower noise levels.

Reinforcement learning (RL) can optimize sequential decisions under uncertainty, but standard RL often generalizes poorly and requires extensive retraining for new outage configurations or generation patterns. We propose a meta-guided gradient-free RL (MGF-RL) framework that learns a transferable initialization from historical outage experiences and rapidly adapts to unseen scenarios with minimal task-specific tuning. MGF-RL couples first-order meta-learning with evolutionary strategies, enabling scalable policy search without gradient computation while accommodating nonlinear, constrained distribution-system dynamics. Experiments on IEEE 13-bus and IEEE 123-bus test systems show that MGF-RL outperforms standard RL, MAML-based meta-RL, and model predictive control across reliability, restoration speed, and adaptation efficiency under renewable forecast errors. MGF-RL generalizes to unseen outages and renewable patterns while requiring substantially fewer fine-tuning episodes than conventional RL. We also provide sublinear regret bounds that relate adaptation efficiency to task similarity and environmental variation, supporting the empirical gains and motivating MGF-RL for real-time load restoration in renewable-rich distribution grids.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5143\u5f15\u5bfc\u65e0\u68af\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u914d\u7535\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u4e8b\u4ef6\u540e\u7684\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6062\u590d", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfRL\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e94\u5bf9\u65b0\u6545\u969c\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u53d1\u7535\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u914d\u7535\u7cfb\u7edf\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u8c03\u5ea6\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u7b49\u6311\u6218", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408\u4e00\u9636\u5143\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ece\u5386\u53f2\u6545\u969c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u4ee5\u6700\u5c11\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u8c03\u4f18\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u573a\u666f", "result": "\u5728IEEE 13\u548c123\u603b\u7ebf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3001\u6062\u590d\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6RL\u3001MAML\u5143RL\u548cMPC\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "MGF-RL\u80fd\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u6545\u969c\u548c\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5c11\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4e3a\u542b\u9ad8\u6bd4\u4f8b\u53ef\u518d\u751f\u80fd\u6e90\u7684\u914d\u7535\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9e\u65f6\u8d1f\u8f7d\u6062\u590d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848"}}

These tags capture high-level causal properties of bugs without relying on free-form explanations. We train a CodeT5-based student model under label-only and reasoning-distilled settings on the IntroClass benchmark. Reasoning supervision consistently improves macro averaged performance, particularly on less frequent bug categories, without increasing model size or complexity.

While automated systems can flag hate speech with high accuracy, they often function as \"black boxes\" that fail to provide the granular, interpretable evidence, such as precise timestamps and target identities, required for effective human-in-the-loop moderation. In this work, we introduce TANDEM, a unified framework that transforms audio-visual hate detection from a binary classification task into a structured reasoning problem. Our approach employs a novel tandem reinforcement learning strategy where vision-language and audio-language models optimize each other through self-constrained cross-modal context, stabilizing reasoning over extended temporal sequences without requiring dense frame-level supervision. Experiments across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that TANDEM significantly outperforms zero-shot and context-augmented baselines, achieving 0.73 F1 in target identification on HateMM (a 30% improvement over state-of-the-art) while maintaining precise temporal grounding. We further observe that while binary detection is robust, differentiating between offensive and hateful content remains challenging in multi-class settings due to inherent label ambiguity and dataset imbalance. More broadly, our findings suggest that structured, interpretable alignment is achievable even in complex multimodal settings, offering a blueprint for the next generation of transparent and actionable online safety moderation tools.", "AI": {"tldr": "TANDEM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u542c\u4ec7\u6068\u5185\u5bb9\u68c0\u6d4b\u4ece\u4e8c\u5143\u5206\u7c7b\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u6a21\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u76ee\u6807\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\uff08HateMM\u6570\u636e\u96c6F1\u5206\u65700.73\u63d0\u534730%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u786e\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u957f\u683c\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u5bb9\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u5bb3\u53d9\u4e8b\u901a\u8fc7\u97f3\u9891\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u7ebf\u7d22\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u7ec7\u6784\u5efa\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u4ec7\u6068\u8a00\u8bba\uff0c\u4f46\u4f5c\u4e3a'\u9ed1\u76d2'\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u9897\u7c92\u5316\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\uff08\u5982\u7cbe\u786e\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u8eab\u4efd\uff09\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u6709\u6548\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u4f5c\u5ba1\u6838\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u65b0\u9896\u7684tandem\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u97f3\u9891-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7ea6\u675f\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u4e92\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u5bc6\u96c6\u5e27\u7ea7\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7a33\u5b9a\u5904\u7406\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eTANDEM\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728HateMM\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u76ee\u6807\u8bc6\u522bF1\u8fbe\u52300.73\uff08\u8f83\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u534730%\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u786e\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002\u4e8c\u5143\u68c0\u6d4b\u7a33\u5065\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u7c7b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u533a\u5206\u5192\u72af\u6027\u548c\u4ec7\u6068\u5185\u5bb9\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5bf9\u9f50\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u5b89\u5168\u5ba1\u6838\u5de5\u5177\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u84dd\u56fe\u3002"}}

However, it exhibits significant quality degradation -- manifested as spatial blur and temporal inconsistency -- under challenging scenarios characterized by limited camera motion or large outpainting regions, where inter-frame information is limited. We identify the cause as a training-inference mismatch in the masking strategy: M3DDM's training applies random mask directions and widths across frames, whereas inference requires consistent directional outpainting throughout the video. To address this, we propose M3DDM+, which applies uniform mask direction and width across all frames during training, followed by fine-tuning of the pretrained M3DDM model.

The incorporation of power actuation and sensing capabilities in CPU designs is indicative of this, enabling the deployment of system software that can actively monitor and adjust energy consumption and performance at runtime. While reinforcement learning (RL) would seem ideal for the design of such energy efficiency control systems, online training presents challenges ranging from the lack of proper models for setting up an adequate simulated environment, to perturbation (noise) and reliability issues, if training is deployed on a live system.\n  In this paper we discuss the use of offline reinforcement learning as an alternative approach for the design of an autonomous CPU power controller, with the goal of improving the energy efficiency of parallel applications at runtime without unduly impacting their performance. Offline RL sidesteps the issues incurred by online RL training by leveraging a dataset of state transitions collected from arbitrary policies prior to training.\n  Our methodology applies offline RL to a gray-box approach to energy efficiency, combining online application-agnostic performance data (e.g., heartbeats) and hardware performance counters to ensure that the scientific objectives are met with limited performance degradation. Evaluating our method on a variety of compute-bound and memory-bound benchmarks and controlling power on a live system through Intel's Running Average Power Limit, we demonstrate that such an offline-trained agent can substantially reduce energy consumption at a tolerable performance degradation cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7528\u4e8eCPU\u529f\u8017\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u5e76\u884c\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u80fd\u8017\u6548\u7387\u800c\u4e0d\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cd\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u8ba1\u7b97\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u80fd\u6548\u53d8\u5f97\u65e5\u76ca\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u9002\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u8017\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u9762\u4e34\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u3001\u6270\u52a8\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7b49\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81ea\u4e3bCPU\u529f\u8017\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5728\u7ebf\u5e94\u7528\u65e0\u5173\u6027\u80fd\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u5fc3\u8df3\uff09\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u6027\u80fd\u8ba1\u6570\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7Intel RAPL\u63a7\u5236\u529f\u8017", "result": "\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u79bb\u7ebf\u8bad\u7ec3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u80fd\u8017\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ec5\u5e26\u6765\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931", "conclusion": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u8bbe\u8ba1CPU\u529f\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u80fd\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347"}}

The extension consists of comprehensively evaluating its generality, semantic leverage, and reasoning mechanisms, also across multiple Key Performance Indicators. Empirical evaluations conducted on three distinct event logs and across the Key Performance Indicators of Total Time and Activity Occurrence prediction indicate that, in data-scarce settings with only 100 traces, the LLM surpasses the benchmark methods.

Although this operation is elementary, its consequences are not always made clear in practice and may be confused with changes in curvature, manifold structure, or coordinate representation. In this note we provide a short, self-contained account of constant metric scaling on arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We distinguish between quantities that change under such a scaling, including norms, distances, volume elements, and gradient magnitudes, and geometric objects that remain invariant, such as the Levi--Civita connection, geodesics, exponential and logarithmic maps, and parallel transport. We also discuss implications for Riemannian optimization, where constant metric scaling can often be interpreted as a global rescaling of step sizes rather than a modification of the underlying geometry. The goal of this note is purely expository and is intended to clarify how a global metric scale parameter can be introduced in Riemannian computation without altering the geometric structures on which these methods rely.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e00\u7bc7\u9610\u8ff0\u9ece\u66fc\u5ea6\u91cf\u5e38\u53c2\u6570\u7f29\u653e\u5f71\u54cd\u7684\u8bf4\u660e\u6027\u8bba\u6587\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u54ea\u4e9b\u51e0\u4f55\u91cf\u4f1a\u53d8\u5316\u3001\u54ea\u4e9b\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8", "motivation": "\u5728\u9ece\u66fc\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u5e38\u6570\u7f29\u653e\u7ecf\u5e38\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u5176\u5f71\u54cd\u5e38\u88ab\u6df7\u6dc6\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u6e05\u6670\u8bf4\u660e\u8fd9\u79cd\u7f29\u653e\u5bf9\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6f84\u6e05\u5e38\u6570\u7f29\u653e\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u5e95\u5c42\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u533a\u5206\u5728\u5ea6\u91cf\u5e38\u6570\u7f29\u653e\u4e0b\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u91cf\uff08\u8303\u6570\u3001\u8ddd\u79bb\u3001\u4f53\u79ef\u5143\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u5927\u5c0f\uff09\u548c\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u8c61\uff08Levi-Civita\u8054\u7edc\u3001\u6d4b\u5730\u7ebf\u3001\u6307\u6570\u548c\u5bf9\u6570\u6620\u5c04\u3001\u5e73\u884c\u79fb\u52a8\uff09", "result": "\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u5e38\u6570\u5ea6\u91cf\u7f29\u653e\u4e0d\u4f1a\u6539\u53d8\u9ece\u66fc\u6d41\u5f62\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u53ea\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd9\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5728\u9ece\u66fc\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u6b63\u786e\u89e3\u91ca\u6b65\u957f\u7f29\u653e", "conclusion": "\u5e38\u6570\u5ea6\u91cf\u7f29\u653e\u5e94\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u6b65\u957f\u7684\u91cd\u65b0\u6807\u5ea6\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u6f84\u6e05\u5bf9\u9ece\u66fc\u8ba1\u7b97\u5e94\u7528\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5b9e\u8df5\u610f\u4e49"}}

This gap highlights a critical limitation in rendering rigid body motion, a core tenet of classical mechanics. While computer graphics and physics-based simulators can easily model such collisions using Newton formulas, modern pretrain-finetune paradigms discard the concept of object rigidity during pixel-level global denoising. Even perfectly correct mathematical constraints are treated as suboptimal solutions (i.e., conditions) during model optimization in post-training, fundamentally limiting the physical realism of generated videos. Motivated by these considerations, we introduce, for the first time, a physics-aware reinforcement learning paradigm for video generation models that enforces physical collision rules directly in high-dimensional spaces, ensuring the physics knowledge is strictly applied rather than treated as conditions. Subsequently, we extend this paradigm to a unified framework, termed Mimicry-Discovery Cycle (MDcycle), which allows substantial fine-tuning while fully preserving the model's ability to leverage physics-grounded feedback. To validate our approach, we construct new benchmark PhysRVGBench and perform extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to thoroughly assess its effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u7269\u7406\u78b0\u649e\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684Mimicry-Discovery Cycle\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u53cd\u9988\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u5927\u91cf\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u539f\u7406\u7684\u8003\u8651\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u521a\u4f53\u8fd0\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u5168\u5c40\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4e22\u5f03\u4e86\u7269\u4f53\u521a\u6027\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u4e5f\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u6b21\u4f18\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "method": "1. \u9996\u6b21\u5f15\u5165\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u76f4\u63a5\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u7269\u7406\u78b0\u649e\u89c4\u5219\uff1b2. \u6269\u5c55\u8be5\u8303\u5f0f\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684Mimicry-Discovery Cycle\uff08MDcycle\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5145\u5206\u4fdd\u7559\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u53cd\u9988\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u5927\u91cf\u5fae\u8c03\uff1b3. \u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6PhysRVGBench\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u7684PhysRVGBench\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u78b0\u649e\u89c4\u5219\u878d\u5165\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0cMDcycle\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u53cd\u9988\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002"}}

Current datasets differ substantially in structure and are time-consuming to access and process, which impedes data integration and reduces the comparability and generalizability of algorithmic developments. This work aims to establish a unified and accessible data resource for T1D algorithm development. Multiple publicly available T1D datasets were consolidated into a unified resource, termed the MetaboNet dataset. Inclusion required the availability of both continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data and corresponding insulin pump dosing records. Additionally, auxiliary information such as reported carbohydrate intake and physical activity was retained when present. The MetaboNet dataset comprises 3135 subjects and 1228 patient-years of overlapping CGM and insulin data, making it substantially larger than existing standalone benchmark datasets. The resource is distributed as a fully public subset available for immediate download at https://metabo-net.org/ , and with a Data Use Agreement (DUA)-restricted subset accessible through their respective application processes. For the datasets in the latter subset, processing pipelines are provided to automatically convert the data into the standardized MetaboNet format. A consolidated public dataset for T1D research is presented, and the access pathways for both its unrestricted and DUA-governed components are described. The resulting dataset covers a broad range of glycemic profiles and demographics and thus can yield more generalizable algorithmic performance than individual datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While existing methods excel in single-person animation, they struggle to handle arbitrary subject counts, diverse character types, and spatial misalignment between the reference image and the driving poses. We attribute these limitations to an overly rigid spatial binding that forces strict pixel-wise alignment between the pose and reference, and an inability to consistently rebind motion to intended subjects. To address these challenges, we propose CoDance, a novel Unbind-Rebind framework that enables the animation of arbitrary subject counts, types, and spatial configurations conditioned on a single, potentially misaligned pose sequence. Specifically, the Unbind module employs a novel pose shift encoder to break the rigid spatial binding between the pose and the reference by introducing stochastic perturbations to both poses and their latent features, thereby compelling the model to learn a location-agnostic motion representation. To ensure precise control and subject association, we then devise a Rebind module, leveraging semantic guidance from text prompts and spatial guidance from subject masks to direct the learned motion to intended characters. Furthermore, to facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we introduce a new multi-subject CoDanceBench.

The goal is to identify the important nodes and edges of an input graph that are crucial for performing a specific graph reasoning task. A number of studies have been conducted in this area, and various benchmark datasets have been proposed to facilitate evaluation. Among them, one of the most challenging is the Spurious-Motif benchmark, introduced at ICLR 2022. The datasets in this synthetic benchmark are deliberately designed to include spurious correlations, making it particularly difficult for models to distinguish truly relevant structures from misleading patterns. As a result, existing methods exhibit significantly worse performance on this benchmark compared to others.\n  In this paper, we focus on improving interpretability on the challenging Spurious-Motif datasets. We demonstrate that the self-reflection technique, commonly used in large language models to tackle complex tasks, can also be effectively adapted to enhance interpretability in datasets with strong spurious correlations. Specifically, we propose a self-reflection framework that can be integrated with existing interpretable graph learning methods. When such a method produces importance scores for each node and edge, our framework feeds these predictions back into the original method to perform a second round of evaluation. This iterative process mirrors how large language models employ self-reflective prompting to reassess their previous outputs. We further analyze the reasons behind this improvement from the perspective of graph representation learning, which motivates us to propose a fine-tuning training method based on this feedback mechanism.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Stemming from this, we present VIGA (Vision-as-Inverse-Graphic Agent) that starts from an empty world and reconstructs or edits scenes through a closed-loop write-run-render-compare-revise procedure. To support long-horizon reasoning, VIGA combines (i) a skill library that alternates generator and verifier roles and (ii) an evolving context memory that contains plans, code diffs, and render history. VIGA is task-agnostic as it doesn't require auxiliary modules, covering a wide range of tasks such as 3D reconstruction, multi-step scene editing, 4D physical interaction, and 2D document editing, etc. Empirically, we found VIGA substantially improves one-shot baselines on BlenderGym (35.32%) and SlideBench (117.17%). Moreover, VIGA is also model-agnostic as it doesn't require finetuning, enabling a unified protocol to evaluate heterogeneous foundation VLMs. To better support this protocol, we introduce BlenderBench, a challenging benchmark that stress-tests interleaved multimodal reasoning with graphics engine, where VIGA improves by 124.70%.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing methods still have limitations in capturing complex sequence dependencies and distinguishing confusing samples with high similarity. To address these challenges, we propose AVP-Pro, a novel two-stage predictive framework that integrates adaptive feature fusion and contrastive learning. To comprehensively capture the physicochemical properties and deep-seated patterns of peptide sequences, we constructed a panoramic feature space encompassing 10 distinct descriptors and designed a hierarchical fusion architecture. This architecture integrates self-attention and adaptive gating mechanisms to dynamically modulate the weights of local motifs extracted by CNNs and global dependencies captured by BiLSTMs based on sequence context. Targeting the blurred decision boundary caused by the high similarity between positive and negative sample sequences, we adopted an Online Hard Example Mining (OHEM)-driven contrastive learning strategy enhanced by BLOSUM62. This approach significantly sharpened the model's discriminative power. Model evaluation results show that in the first stage of general AVP identification, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.9531 and an MCC of 0.9064, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In the second stage of functional subtype prediction, combined with a transfer learning strategy, the model realized accurate classification of 6 viral families and 8 specific viruses under small-sample conditions.

By transforming high-dimensional, multi-sensor observations from the Landsat series (5, 7, 8, and 9) and MODIS Terra into information-dense, quantized latent vectors, ESD distills essential geophysical and semantic features into a unified latent space. Utilizing the ESDNet architecture and Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ), the dataset achieves a transformative ~340-fold reduction in data volume compared to raw archives. This compression allows the entire global land surface for a single year to be encapsulated within approximately 2.4 TB, enabling decadal-scale global analysis on standard local workstations.

Limited resources, however, require careful prioritization of which facilities to upgrade to maximize population coverage while accounting for diverse expert and stakeholder preferences. In collaboration with the Ethiopian Public Health Institute and Ministry of Health, we propose a hybrid framework that systematically integrates expert knowledge with optimization techniques. Classical optimization methods provide theoretical guarantees but require explicit, quantitative objectives, whereas stakeholder criteria are often articulated in natural language and difficult to formalize. To bridge these domains, we develop the Large language model and Extended Greedy (LEG) framework. Our framework combines a provable approximation algorithm for population coverage optimization with LLM-driven iterative refinement that incorporates human-AI alignment to ensure solutions reflect expert qualitative guidance while preserving coverage guarantees.

While some existing methods propose a codependent generation process, they do not view the problem of joint generation from a structural alignment perspective. Recent work uses Score Distillation Sampling to generate aligned 3D models, but SDS is known to be time-consuming, prone to mode collapse, and often provides cartoonish results. By contrast, our suggested approach relies on the joint transport of a segment in the sample space, yielding faster computation at inference time. Our approach can be built on top of an arbitrary Rectified Flow model operating on the structured latent space. We show the applicability of our method to the domains of image, video, and 3D shape generation using state-of-the-art baselines and evaluate it against both editing-based and joint inference-based competing approaches.

To address this, we present BoxMind, a closed-loop AI expert system validated in elite boxing competition. By defining atomic punch events with precise temporal boundaries and spatial and technical attributes, we parse match footage into 18 hierarchical technical-tactical indicators. We then propose a graph-based predictive model that fuses these explicit technical-tactical profiles with learnable, time-variant latent embeddings to capture the dynamics of boxer matchups. Modeling match outcome as a differentiable function of technical-tactical indicators, we turn winning probability gradients into executable tactical adjustments. Experiments show that the outcome prediction model achieves state-of-the-art performance, with 69.8% accuracy on BoxerGraph test set and 87.5% on Olympic matches. Using this predictive model as a foundation, the system generates strategic recommendations that demonstrate proficiency comparable to human experts. BoxMind is validated through a closed-loop deployment during the 2024 Paris Olympics, directly contributing to the Chinese National Team's historic achievement of three gold and two silver medals.

To tackle UMS-ReID, we introduce image-text knowledge modeling (ITKM) -- a three-stage framework that effectively exploits the representational power of vision-language models. We start with a pre-trained CLIP model with an image encoder and a text encoder. In Stage I, we introduce a scenario embedding in the image encoder and fine-tune the encoder to adaptively leverage knowledge from multiple scenarios. In Stage II, we optimize a set of learned text embeddings to associate with pseudo-labels from Stage I and introduce a multi-scenario separation loss to increase the divergence between inter-scenario text representations.

Differential privacy (DP) offers rigorous privacy guarantees and has been widely adopted in fine-tuning; however, naively injecting noise across the high-dimensional parameter space creates perturbations with large norms, degrading performance and destabilizing training. To address this issue, we propose DP-SFT, a two-stage subspace fine-tuning method that substantially reduces noise magnitude while preserving formal DP guarantees. Our intuition is that, during fine-tuning, significant parameter updates lie within a low-dimensional, task-specific subspace, while other directions change minimally. Hence, we only inject DP noise into this subspace to protect privacy without perturbing irrelevant parameters. In phase one, we identify the subspace by analyzing principal gradient directions to capture task-specific update signals. In phase two, we project full gradients onto this subspace, add DP noise, and map the perturbed gradients back to the original parameter space for model updates, markedly lowering noise impact. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DP-SFT enhances accuracy and stability under rigorous DP constraints, accelerates convergence, and achieves substantial gains over DP fine-tuning baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Unlike static scenarios, dynamically captured UAV videos exhibit multi-source motion coupling, where the motion of objects and UAV-induced global motion are intricately intertwined. Consequently, existing methods may misclassify normal UAV movements as anomalies or fail to capture true anomalies concealed within dynamic backgrounds. Moreover, many approaches do not adequately address the joint modeling of inter-frame continuity and local spatial correlations across diverse temporal scales. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Frequency-Assisted Temporal Dilation Mamba (FTDMamba) network for UAV VAD, including two core components: (1) a Frequency Decoupled Spatiotemporal Correlation Module, which disentangles coupled motion patterns and models global spatiotemporal dependencies through frequency analysis; and (2) a Temporal Dilation Mamba Module, which leverages Mamba's sequence modeling capability to jointly learn fine-grained temporal dynamics and local spatial structures across multiple temporal receptive fields. Additionally, unlike existing UAV VAD datasets which focus on static backgrounds, we construct a large-scale Moving UAV VAD dataset (MUVAD), comprising 222,736 frames with 240 anomaly events across 12 anomaly types. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FTDMamba achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on two public static benchmarks and the new MUVAD dataset.

To improve clustering accuracy, many researchers have incorporated background knowledge, typically in the form of must-link and cannot-link constraints, to guide the clustering process. With the recent advent of large language models (LLMs), there is growing interest in improving clustering quality through LLM-based automatic constraint generation. In this paper, we propose a novel constraint-generation approach that reduces resource consumption by generating constraint sets rather than using traditional pairwise constraints. This approach improves both query efficiency and constraint accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods. We further introduce a constrained clustering algorithm tailored to the characteristics of LLM-generated constraints. Our method incorporates a confidence threshold and a penalty mechanism to address potentially inaccurate constraints. We evaluate our approach on five text datasets, considering both the cost of constraint generation and the overall clustering performance.

Our approach involves an offline, cross-architecture knowledge distillation, transferring the rich visual representations of a large, frozen DINOv2 teacher to a compact ResNet-18 student on the general-purpose ImageNet dataset. This distilled encoder, now endowed with powerful visual priors, is then jointly fine-tuned with a diffusion policy head on the target manipulation tasks. Extensive experiments on $34$ simulated benchmarks and $5$ challenging real-world tasks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms policies equipped with from-scratch ResNet or fine-tuned DINOv2 encoders. Notably, X-Distill also surpasses 3D encoders that utilize privileged point cloud observations or much larger Vision-Language Models. Our work highlights the efficacy of a simple, well-founded distillation strategy for achieving state-of-the-art performance in data-efficient robotic manipulation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Despite progress in basic shape-morphing design with simple geometries, achieving advanced applications such as conformal implant deployment or aerodynamic morphing requires accurate and diverse morphing designs on complex geometries, which remains challenging. Here, we present a Spectral and Spatial Neural Operator (S2NO), which enables high-fidelity morphing prediction on complex geometries. S2NO effectively captures global and local morphing behaviours on irregular computational domains by integrating Laplacian eigenfunction encoding and spatial convolutions. Combining S2NO with evolutionary algorithms enables voxel-level optimisation of material distributions for shape morphing programming on various complex geometries, including irregular-boundary shapes, porous structures, and thin-walled structures. Furthermore, the neural operator's discretisation-invariant property enables super-resolution material distribution design, further expanding the diversity and complexity of morphing design. These advancements significantly improve the efficiency and capability of programming complex shape morphing.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, the on-board processing of high-resolution oblique streams is severely bottlenecked by the strict Size, Weight, and Power (SWaP) constraints of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The computational density required to process these wide-field-of-view streams precludes low-latency inference on standard edge hardware. To address this, we propose Temporal Token Reuse (TTR), an adaptive inference framework capable of accelerating video segmentation on embedded devices. TTR exploits the intrinsic spatiotemporal redundancy of aerial video by formulating image patches as tokens; it utilizes a lightweight similarity metric to dynamically identify static regions and propagate their precomputed deep features, thereby bypassing redundant backbone computations. We validate the framework on standard benchmarks and a newly curated Oblique Floodwater Dataset designed for hydrological monitoring. Experimental results on edge-grade hardware demonstrate that TTR achieves a 30% reduction in inference latency with negligible degradation in segmentation accuracy (< 0.5% mIoU). These findings confirm that TTR effectively shifts the operational Pareto frontier, enabling high-fidelity, real-time oblique video understanding for time-critical remote sensing missions", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Traditional default prediction suffers from two limitations: binary classification ignores default timing, treating early defaulters (high loss) equivalently to late defaulters (low loss), and centralized training violates emerging regulatory constraints. We propose a Federated Survival Learning framework with Bayesian Differential Privacy (FSL-BDP) that models time-to-default trajectories without centralizing sensitive data. The framework provides Bayesian (data-dependent) differential privacy (DP) guarantees while enabling institutions to jointly learn risk dynamics. Experiments on three real-world credit datasets (LendingClub, SBA, Bondora) show that federation fundamentally alters the relative effectiveness of privacy mechanisms. While classical DP performs better than Bayesian DP in centralized settings, the latter benefits substantially more from federation (+7.0\\% vs +1.4\\%), achieving near parity of non-private performance and outperforming classical DP in the majority of participating clients. This ranking reversal yields a key decision-support insight: privacy mechanism selection should be evaluated in the target deployment architecture, rather than centralized benchmarks.

Recently, several studies have used in-context learning to capture relationships among molecules and properties, but they face two limitations in: (1) exploiting prior knowledge of functional groups that are causally linked to properties and (2) identifying key substructures directly correlated with properties. We propose CaMol, a context-aware graph causality inference framework, to address these challenges by using a causal inference perspective, assuming that each molecule consists of a latent causal structure that determines a specific property. First, we introduce a context graph that encodes chemical knowledge by linking functional groups, molecules, and properties to guide the discovery of causal substructures. Second, we propose a learnable atom masking strategy to disentangle causal substructures from confounding ones. Third, we introduce a distribution intervener that applies backdoor adjustment by combining causal substructures with chemically grounded confounders, disentangling causal effects from real-world chemical variations. Experiments on diverse molecular datasets showed that CaMol achieved superior accuracy and sample efficiency in few-shot tasks, showing its generalizability to unseen properties. Also, the discovered causal substructures were strongly aligned with chemical knowledge about functional groups, supporting the model interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Transformer-based models struggle in this setting because memory grows quadratically with token count, constraining either the contextual scope or the spatial resolution. We introduce CASWiT (Context-Aware Stage-Wise Transformer), a dual-branch, Swin-based architecture that injects global cues into fine-grained UHR features. A context encoder processes a downsampled neighborhood to capture long-range dependencies, while a high resolution encoder extracts detailed features from UHR patches. A cross-scale fusion module, combining cross-attention and gated feature injection, enriches high-resolution tokens with context. Beyond architecture, we propose a SimMIM-style pretraining. We mask 75% of the high-resolution image tokens and the low-resolution center region that spatially corresponds to the UHR patch, then train the shared dual-encoder with small decoder to reconstruct the UHR initial image.

To mitigate these risks, this study compares two predictive maintenance strategies for helicopter engines: a supervised classification pipeline and an unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on autoencoders (AEs). The supervised method relies on labelled examples of both normal and faulty behaviour, while the unsupervised approach learns a model of normal operation using only healthy engine data, flagging deviations as potential faults. Both methods are evaluated on a real-world dataset comprising labelled snapshots of helicopter engine telemetry. While supervised models demonstrate strong performance when annotated failures are available, the AE achieves effective detection without requiring fault labels, making it particularly well suited for settings where failure data are scarce or incomplete. The comparison highlights the practical trade-offs between accuracy, data availability, and deployment feasibility, and underscores the potential of unsupervised learning as a viable solution for early fault detection in aerospace applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we propose an approach that integrates VLMs with traditional computer vision methods through explicit logic reasoning to enhance SA in three key ways: (a) extracting fine-grained event details, (b) employing an intelligent fine-tuning (FT) strategy that achieves substantially higher accuracy than uninformed selection, and (c) generating justifications for VLM outputs during inference. We demonstrate that our intelligent FT mechanism improves the accuracy and provides a valuable means, during inferencing, to either confirm the validity of the VLM output or indicate why it may be questionable.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Clustering requires a balance between abstraction and representation. To identify clusters, we need to abstract from superfluous details of individual objects. But we also need a rich representation that emphasizes the key features shared by groups of objects that distinguish them from other groups of objects.\n  Each clustering algorithm implements a different trade-off between abstraction and representation. Classical K-means implements a high level of abstraction - details are simply averaged out - combined with a very simple representation - all clusters are Gaussians in the original data space. We will see how approaches to subspace and deep clustering support high-dimensional and complex data by allowing richer representations. However, with increasing representational expressiveness comes the need to explicitly enforce abstraction in the objective function to ensure that the resulting method performs clustering and not just representation learning. We will see how current deep clustering methods define and enforce abstraction through centroid-based and density-based clustering losses. Balancing the conflicting goals of abstraction and representation is challenging. Ideas from subspace clustering help by learning one latent space for the information that is relevant to clustering and another latent space to capture all other information in the data.\n  The tutorial ends with an outlook on future research in clustering. Future methods will more adaptively balance abstraction and representation to improve performance, energy efficiency and interpretability. By automatically finding the sweet spot between abstraction and representation, the human brain is very good at clustering and other related tasks such as single-shot learning.

Low-cost construction materials and high thermal-mass surfaces further exacerbate this risk. Yet scalable methods for assessing such heat-relevant building attributes remain scarce. We propose a machine learning framework that fuses openly available unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and street-view (SV) imagery via a coupled global context vision transformer (CGCViT) to learn heat-relevant representations of urban structures. Thermal infrared (TIR) measurements from HotSat-1 are used to quantify the relationship between building attributes and heat-associated health risks. Our dual-modality cross-view learning approach outperforms the best single-modality models by up to $9.3\\%$, demonstrating that UAV and SV imagery provide valuable complementary perspectives on urban structures.

Thereby, in realistic scenarios, the source data may no longer be available during adaptation, and the label space of the target domain may differ from the source label space. This setting, known as source-free universal domain adaptation (SF-UniDA), has recently gained attention, but all existing approaches only assume a single domain shift from source to target. In this work, we present the first study on continual SF-UniDA, where the model must adapt sequentially to a stream of multiple different unlabeled target domains. Building upon our previous methods for online SF-UniDA, we combine their key ideas by integrating Gaussian mixture model-based pseudo-labeling within a mean teacher framework for improved stability over long adaptation sequences. Additionally, we introduce consistency losses for further robustness. The resulting method GMM-COMET provides a strong first baseline for continual SF-UniDA and is the only approach in our experiments to consistently improve upon the source-only model across all evaluated scenarios.

Intrinsic noise in CIR triplets incurs intrinsic uncertainty and threatens the model's robustness. Probabilistic learning approaches have shown promise in addressing such issues; however, they fall short for CIR due to their instance-level holistic modeling and homogeneous treatment of queries and targets. This paper introduces a Heterogeneous Uncertainty-Guided (HUG) paradigm to overcome these limitations. HUG utilizes a fine-grained probabilistic learning framework, where queries and targets are represented by Gaussian embeddings that capture detailed concepts and uncertainties. We customize heterogeneous uncertainty estimations for multi-modal queries and uni-modal targets. Given a query, we capture uncertainties not only regarding uni-modal content quality but also multi-modal coordination, followed by a provable dynamic weighting mechanism to derive comprehensive query uncertainty. We further design uncertainty-guided objectives, including query-target holistic contrast and fine-grained contrasts with comprehensive negative sampling strategies, which effectively enhance discriminative learning. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate HUG's effectiveness beyond state-of-the-art baselines, with faithful analysis justifying the technical contributions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, the structural complexity of time series, characterized by multi-scale temporal patterns and heterogeneous components, remains insufficiently addressed. In this work, we propose a structure-disentangled multiscale generation framework for time series. Our approach encodes sequences into discrete tokens at multiple temporal resolutions and performs autoregressive generation in a coarse-to-fine manner, thereby preserving hierarchical dependencies. To tackle structural heterogeneity, we introduce a dual-path VQ-VAE that disentangles trend and seasonal components, enabling the learning of semantically consistent latent representations. Additionally, we present a guidance-based reconstruction strategy, where coarse seasonal signals are utilized as priors to guide the reconstruction of fine-grained seasonal patterns.

However, such a refined representation for scene understanding incurs prohibitive computation and memory overhead, posing a major barrier to practical real-time deployment. To address this, we propose SUG-Occ, an explicit Semantics and Uncertainty Guided Sparse Learning Enabled 3D Occupancy Prediction Framework, which exploits the inherent sparsity of 3D scenes to reduce redundant computation while maintaining geometric and semantic completeness. Specifically, we first utilize semantic and uncertainty priors to suppress projections from free space during view transformation while employing an explicit unsigned distance encoding to enhance geometric consistency, producing a structurally consistent sparse 3D representation. Secondly, we design an cascade sparse completion module via hyper cross sparse convolution and generative upsampling to enable efficiently coarse-to-fine reasoning. Finally, we devise an object contextual representation (OCR) based mask decoder that aggregates global semantic context from sparse features and refines voxel-wise predictions via lightweight query-context interactions, avoiding expensive attention operations over volumetric features.

Traditional PTQ methods typically rely on limited samples, making it difficult to capture the activation distribution during the inference phase, leading to biases in quantization parameters. To address this, we propose \\textbf{FAQ} (Family-Aware Quantization), a calibration data regeneration framework that leverages prior knowledge from LLMs of the same family to generate high-fidelity calibration samples. Specifically, FAQ first inputs the original calibration samples into a larger LLM from the same family as the target model, regenerating a series of high-fidelity calibration data using a highly consistent knowledge system. Subsequently, this data, carrying Chain-of-Thought reasoning and conforming to the expected activation distribution, undergoes group competition under expert guidance to select the best samples, which are then re-normalized to enhance the effectiveness of standard PTQ. Experiments on multiple model series, including Qwen3-8B, show that FAQ reduces accuracy loss by up to 28.5\\% compared to the baseline with original calibration data, demonstrating its powerful potential and contribution.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To overcome these limitations, we propose WetSAM, a SAM-based framework that integrates satellite image time series for wetland mapping from sparse point supervision through a dual-branch design, where a temporally prompted branch extends SAM with hierarchical adapters and dynamic temporal aggregation to disentangle wetland characteristics from phenological variability, and a spatial branch employs a temporally constrained region-growing strategy to generate reliable dense pseudo-labels, while a bidirectional consistency regularization jointly optimizes both branches. Extensive experiments across eight global regions of approximately 5,000 km2 each demonstrate that WetSAM substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average F1-score of 85.58%, and delivering accurate and structurally consistent wetland segmentation with minimal labeling effort, highlighting its strong generalization capability and potential for scalable, low-cost, high-resolution wetland mapping.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u7a00\u758f\u70b9\u6807\u6ce8\u4e0b\u6e7f\u5730\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3001\u5355\u671f\u5f71\u50cf\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u53ca\u9759\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86WetSAM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u53cc\u5411\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u65f6\u5e8f\u536b\u661f\u5f71\u50cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ece\u7a00\u758f\u70b9\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u7cbe\u51c6\u6e7f\u5730\u5236\u56fe\u3002", "motivation": "\u6e7f\u5730\u7cbe\u51c6\u5236\u56fe\u5bf9\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u76d1\u6d4b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5bc6\u96c6\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a00\u758f\u70b9\u6807\u7b7e\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6b64\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\uff0c\u4e14\u6e7f\u5730\u7684\u5f3a\u70c8\u5b63\u8282\u6027\u548c\u5e74\u9645\u52a8\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u4f7f\u5355\u671f\u5f71\u50cf\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u51c6\u786e\u5236\u56fe\uff0c\u9759\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982SAM\uff09\u867d\u80fd\u4ece\u70b9\u63d0\u793a\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u6e7f\u5730\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u7834\u788e\u63a9\u7801\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faWetSAM\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8eSAM\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a1) \u65f6\u5e8f\u63d0\u793a\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u9002\u914d\u5668\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u805a\u5408\u6269\u5c55SAM\uff0c\u4ee5\u4ece\u7269\u5019\u53d8\u5f02\u4e2d\u5206\u79bb\u6e7f\u5730\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2) \u7a7a\u95f4\u5206\u652f\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u533a\u57df\u751f\u957f\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u9760\u7a20\u5bc6\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff1b3) \u53cc\u5411\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4e24\u4e2a\u5206\u652f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516b\u4e2a\u5168\u7403\u533a\u57df\uff08\u5404\u7ea65000\u5e73\u65b9\u516c\u91cc\uff09\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cWetSAM\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747F1\u5206\u6570\u8fbe\u523085.58%\uff0c\u80fd\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u7ed3\u6784\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6e7f\u5730\u5206\u5272\u3002", "conclusion": "WetSAM\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5177\u5907\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6e7f\u5730\u5236\u56fe\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u70b9\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6e7f\u5730\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Parameter-efficient methods such as LoRA are widely adopted to reduce communication and memory costs. Despite these advances, practical FL deployments often exhibit rank heterogeneity, since different clients may use different low-rank configurations. This makes direct aggregation of LoRA updates biased and unstable. Existing solutions typically enforce unified ranks or align heterogeneous updates into a shared subspace, which over-constrains client-specific semantics, limits personalization, and provides weak protection of local client information under differential privacy noise. To address this issue, we propose Selective Dual-module Federated LoRA (SDFLoRA), which decomposes each client adapter into a global module that captures transferable knowledge and a local module that preserves client-specific adaptations. The global module is selectively aligned and aggregated across clients, while local modules remain private. This design enables robust learning under rank heterogeneity and supports privacy-aware optimization by injecting differential privacy noise exclusively into the global module.

We refer to this approach as the Mathematical Artificial Data Boundary Neural Operator (MAD-BNO), which learns boundary-to-boundary mappings using MAD-generated Dirichlet-Neumann data pairs. Once trained, the interior solution at arbitrary locations can be efficiently recovered through boundary integral formulations, supporting Dirichlet, Neumann, and mixed boundary conditions as well as general source terms.

Accurately capturing these topological features often requires incorporating width-related information, including the thickness and length inherent to the image structures. However, traditional mathematical definitions of topological structures lack this dimensional width information, limiting methods like persistent homology from fully addressing practical segmentation needs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel mathematical framework that explicitly integrates width information into the characterization of topological structures. This method leverages persistent homology, complemented by smoothing concepts from partial differential equations (PDEs), to modify local extrema of upper-level sets. This approach enables the resulting topological structures to inherently capture width properties. We incorporate this enhanced topological description into variational image segmentation models. Using some proper loss functions, we are also able to design neural networks that can segment images with the required topological and width properties. Through variational constraints on the relevant topological energies, our approach successfully preserves essential topological invariants such as connectivity and genus counts, simultaneously ensuring that segmented structures retain critical width attributes, including line thickness and length.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is essential for acquiring reasoning skills; however, its high computational cost makes it impractical for efficient online adaptation. We empirically observe that the parameter updates induced by SFT and RL are nearly orthogonal. Based on this observation, we propose Parametric Skill Transfer (PaST), a framework that supports modular skill transfer for efficient and effective knowledge adaptation. By extracting a domain-agnostic Skill Vector from a source domain, we can linearly inject knowledge manipulation skills into a target model after it has undergone lightweight SFT on new data. Experiments on knowledge-incorporation QA (SQuAD, LooGLE) and agentic tool-use benchmarks (ToolBench) demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. On SQuAD, PaST outperforms the state-of-the-art self-editing SFT baseline by up to 9.9 points.

In this work, we propose the first agnostic boosting algorithm with near-optimal sample complexity, running in time polynomial in the sample size when considering the other parameters of the problem fixed.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u8fd1\u4e4e\u6700\u4f18\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u77e5\u63d0\u5347\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u5176\u4ed6\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5728\u6837\u672c\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u5448\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u589e\u957f\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u7ecf\u5178\u63d0\u5347\u65b9\u6cd5\u5df2\u88ab\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4e0d\u53ef\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\uff08\u4e0d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u505a\u4efb\u4f55\u5047\u8bbe\uff09\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4ecd\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ef\u77e5\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u5df2\u63a5\u8fd1\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u4f46\u5df2\u77e5\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u662f\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u7684\u3002\u672c\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e00\u4e2a\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u8fd1\u4e4e\u6700\u4f18\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u77e5\u63d0\u5347\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u77e5\u63d0\u5347\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\u5728\u4e8e\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6837\u672c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff08\u5f53\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5176\u4ed6\u53c2\u6570\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u77e5\u63d0\u5347\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u5728\u6837\u672c\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u662f\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7ea7\u7684\uff08\u5176\u4ed6\u53c2\u6570\u56fa\u5b9a\uff09\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6b64\u524d\u7b97\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u6307\u6570\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u6210\u529f\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u540c\u65f6\u5177\u5907\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u77e5\u63d0\u5347\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u53ef\u77e5\u5b66\u4e60\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u63d0\u5347\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this work, we present MHA2MLA-VLM, a parameter-efficient and multimodal-aware framework for converting off-the-shelf VLMs to MLA. Our approach features two core techniques: (1) a modality-adaptive partial-RoPE strategy that supports both traditional and multimodal settings by selectively masking nonessential dimensions, and (2) a modality-decoupled low-rank approximation method that independently compresses the visual and textual KV spaces. Furthermore, we introduce parameter-efficient fine-tuning to minimize adaptation cost and demonstrate that minimizing output activation error, rather than parameter distance, substantially reduces performance loss. Extensive experiments on three representative VLMs show that MHA2MLA-VLM restores original model performance with minimal supervised data, significantly reduces KV cache footprint, and integrates seamlessly with KV quantization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Yet, learning effectively from tabular data in few-shot settings, where labeled examples are scarce, remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional tree-based methods often falter in these regimes due to their reliance on statistical purity metrics, which become unstable and prone to overfitting with limited supervision. At the same time, direct applications of large language models (LLMs) often overlook its inherent structure, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose FORESTLLM, a novel framework that unifies the structural inductive biases of decision forests with the semantic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Crucially, FORESTLLM leverages the LLM only during training, treating it as an offline model designer that encodes rich, contextual knowledge into a lightweight, interpretable forest model, eliminating the need for LLM inference at test time. Our method is two-fold. First, we introduce a semantic splitting criterion in which the LLM evaluates candidate partitions based on their coherence over both labeled and unlabeled data, enabling the induction of more robust and generalizable tree structures under few-shot supervision. Second, we propose a one-time in-context inference mechanism for leaf node stabilization, where the LLM distills the decision path and its supporting examples into a concise, deterministic prediction, replacing noisy empirical estimates with semantically informed outputs.

However, current works mostly rely on imitation learning from sparse trajectory annotations and under-utilize their potential as generative models. We propose Generative Scenario Rollouts (GeRo), a plug-and-play framework for VLA models that jointly performs planning and generation of language-grounded future traffic scenes through an autoregressive rollout strategy. First, a VLA model is trained to encode ego vehicle and agent dynamics into latent tokens under supervision from planning, motion, and language tasks, facilitating text-aligned generation. Next, GeRo performs language-conditioned autoregressive generation. Given multi-view images, a scenario description, and ego-action questions, it generates future latent tokens and textual responses to guide long-horizon rollouts. A rollout-consistency loss stabilizes predictions using ground truth or pseudo-labels, mitigating drift and preserving text-action alignment. This design enables GeRo to perform temporally consistent, language-grounded rollouts that support long-horizon reasoning and multi-agent planning. On Bench2Drive, GeRo improves driving score and success rate by +15.7 and +26.2, respectively. By integrating reinforcement learning with generative rollouts, GeRo achieves state-of-the-art closed-loop and open-loop performance, demonstrating strong zero-shot robustness.

However, the potential of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which shows great successes for enhancing large language models (LLMs), has not been well explored, due to the fundamental difference between LLM and DLM decoding. To fill this critical gap, we systematically test the performance of DLMs within the RAG framework. Our findings reveal that DLMs coupled with RAG show promising potentials with stronger dependency on contextual information, but suffer from limited generation precision. We identify a key underlying issue: Response Semantic Drift (RSD), where the generated answer progressively deviates from the query's original semantics, leading to low precision content. We trace this problem to the denoising strategies in DLMs, which fail to maintain semantic alignment with the query throughout the iterative denoising process. To address this, we propose Semantic-Preserving REtrieval-Augmented Diffusion (SPREAD), a novel framework that introduces a query-relevance-guided denoising strategy. By actively guiding the denoising trajectory, SPREAD ensures the generation remains anchored to the query's semantics and effectively suppresses drift. Experimental results demonstrate that SPREAD significantly enhances the precision and effectively mitigates RSD of generated answers within the RAG framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "Diffusion\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728RAG\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u56de\u7b54\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5SPREAD\u901a\u8fc7\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u7b56\u7565\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1Diffusion\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662fLLM\u548cDLM\u89e3\u7801\u673a\u5236\u7684\u6839\u672c\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u4e14DLM\u5728RAG\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSPREAD\uff08Semantic-Preserving REtrieval-Augmented Diffusion\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u5f15\u5bfc\u53bb\u566a\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSPREAD\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86RAG\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u56de\u7b54\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "SPREAD\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u53bb\u566a\u673a\u5236\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86DLM\u5728RAG\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3aDiffusion\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This setting poses a challenge for existing 3DSIS methods, which require a discrete matching step due to their lack of temporal reasoning, and for 4D LiDAR approaches, which perform poorly due to their reliance on high-frequency temporal measurements that are uncommon in the longer-horizon evolution of indoor environments. We propose ReScene4D, a novel method that adapts 3DSIS architectures for 4DSIS without needing dense observations. It explores strategies to share information across observations, demonstrating that this shared context not only enables consistent instance tracking but also improves standard 3DSIS quality.

Our flexible framework can work with partial, noisy, or out-of-distribution data, all while maintaining consistency with the underlying physical models. The paired autoencoders enable reconstruction of corrupted data, and then use the reconstructed data for parameter estimation, which produces more accurate reconstructions compared to paired autoencoders alone and end-to-end encoder-decoders of the same architecture, especially in scenarios with data inconsistencies.

We confirm this observation across a breadth of aggregation rules using Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout, on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ. We attempt to explain this discrepancy by investigating possible explanations, such as the link between score estimation and image quality. We also look into tabular data through random forests, and find that one aggregation strategy outperforms the others. Finally, we provide theoretical insights into the summing of score models, which shed light not only on ensembling but also on several model composition techniques (e.g. guidance).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u867d\u7136\u96c6\u6210\u80fd\u6539\u5584\u5206\u6570\u5339\u914d\u635f\u5931\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4f3c\u7136\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u80fd\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347\u56fe\u50cf\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5982FID\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u67d0\u4e9b\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3002\u96c6\u6210\u4f5c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7a76\u96c6\u6210\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u6a21\u5e26\u6765\u5b9e\u8d28\u597d\u5904\u3002", "method": "\u5728CIFAR-10\u548cFFHQ\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1bDropout\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u805a\u5408\u89c4\u5219\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96c6\u6210\u6548\u679c\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u8868\u73b0\uff1b\u5e76\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u5206\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u6c42\u548c\u7684\u6027\u8d28\u3002", "result": "\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u901a\u5e38\u6539\u5584\u5206\u6570\u5339\u914d\u635f\u5931\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u4f3c\u7136\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u80fd\u4e00\u81f4\u63d0\u5347FID\u7b49\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u6307\u6807\uff1b\u8868\u683c\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5206\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u6c42\u548c\u7684\u6027\u8d28\uff0c\u5bf9\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u7ec4\u5408\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982\u5f15\u5bfc\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u4f18\u5316\u67d0\u4e9b\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u635f\u5931\u548c\u4f3c\u7136\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0d\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u7684\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u9700\u8981\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

We thus need stronger mitigations against bad actors misusing increasingly powerful systems. Prior work has shown that activation probes may be a promising misuse mitigation technique, but we identify a key remaining challenge: probes fail to generalize under important production distribution shifts. In particular, we find that the shift from short-context to long-context inputs is difficult for existing probe architectures. We propose several new probe architecture that handle this long-context distribution shift.\n  We evaluate these probes in the cyber-offensive domain, testing their robustness against various production-relevant shifts, including multi-turn conversations, static jailbreaks, and adaptive red teaming. Our results demonstrate that while multimax addresses context length, a combination of architecture choice and training on diverse distributions is required for broad generalization. Additionally, we show that pairing probes with prompted classifiers achieves optimal accuracy at a low cost due to the computational efficiency of probes.\n  These findings have informed the successful deployment of misuse mitigation probes in user-facing instances of Gemini, Google's frontier language model. Finally, we find early positive results using AlphaEvolve to automate improvements in both probe architecture search and adaptive red teaming, showing that automating some AI safety research is already possible.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We propose \\textit{low-rank KV adaptation} (LRKV), a simple modification of multi-head attention that reduces KV cache memory by exploiting redundancy across attention heads while preserving full token-level resolution. Each layer uses a shared full-rank KV projection augmented with low-rank, head-specific residuals, yielding a continuous trade-off between complete sharing and fully independent attention.\n  LRKV is a drop-in replacement for standard multi-head attention and directly subsumes query-sharing approaches such as multi-query and grouped-query attention, while remaining distinct from latent-compression methods such as multi-latent attention (MLA). Across large-scale pretraining experiments, LRKV consistently achieves faster loss reduction, lower validation perplexity, and stronger downstream task performance than standard attention, MQA/GQA, and MLA. At the 2.5B scale, LRKV outperforms standard attention while using roughly half the KV cache, and reaches equivalent model quality with up to \\textbf{20-25\\% less training compute} when measured in cumulative FLOPs. To explain these gains, we analyze attention head structure in operator space and show that LRKV preserves nearly all functional head diversity relative to standard attention, whereas more aggressive KV-sharing mechanisms rely on compensatory query specialization.

Although modern ES systems achieve high accuracy using powerful neural models, their deployment typically relies on CPU or GPU infrastructures that are energy-intensive and poorly suited for real-time inference in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we explore the feasibility of implementing McDonald-style extractive summarization on a low-power CMOS coupled oscillator-based Ising machine (COBI) that supports integer-valued, all-to-all spin couplings. We first propose a hardware-aware Ising formulation that reduces the scale imbalance between local fields and coupling terms, thereby improving robustness to coefficient quantization: this method can be applied to any problem formulation that requires k of n variables to be chosen. We then develop a complete ES pipeline including (i) stochastic rounding and iterative refinement to compensate for precision loss, and (ii) a decomposition strategy that partitions a large ES problem into smaller Ising subproblems that can be efficiently solved on COBI and later combined. Experimental results on the CNN/DailyMail dataset show that our pipeline can produce high-quality summaries using only integer-coupled Ising hardware with limited precision. COBI achieves 3-4.5x runtime speedups compared to a brute-force method, which is comparable to software Tabu search, and two to three orders of magnitude reductions in energy, while maintaining competitive summary quality. These results highlight the potential of deploying CMOS Ising solvers for real-time, low-energy text summarization on edge devices.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
