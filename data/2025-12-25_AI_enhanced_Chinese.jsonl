While recent VLMs achieve strong scene-level reasoning across a range of visual tasks, there exists no benchmark that systematically evaluates or trains them for gaze interpretation, leaving open the question of whether gaze understanding can emerge from general-purpose vision-language pre-training. To address this gap, we introduce VL4Gaze, the first large-scale benchmark designed to investigate, evaluate, and unlock the potential of VLMs for gaze understanding. VL4Gaze contains 489K automatically generated question-answer pairs across 124K images and formulates gaze understanding as a unified VQA problem through four complementary tasks: (1) gaze object description, (2) gaze direction description, (3) gaze point location, and (4) ambiguous question recognition. We comprehensively evaluate both commercial and open-source VLMs under in-context learning and fine-tuning settings. The results show that even large-scale VLMs struggle to reliably infer gaze semantics and spatial localization without task-specific supervision. In contrast, training on VL4Gaze brings substantial and consistent improvements across all tasks, highlighting the importance of targeted multi-task supervision for developing gaze understanding capabilities in VLMs. We will release the dataset and code to support further research and development in this direction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7406\u89e3\u4eba\u7c7b\u51dd\u89c6\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21benchmark VL4Gaze\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u76d1\u7763\u624d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u51dd\u89c6\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u51dd\u89c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u89e3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u3001\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u4ea4\u5f80\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u51dd\u89c6\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd8\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u6216\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u51dd\u89c6\u7406\u89e3\u7684benchmark\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u6025\u9700\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86VL4Gaze benchmark\uff0c\u5305\u542b124K\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u7684489K\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u4efb\u52a1\u5c06\u51dd\u89c6\u7406\u89e3\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3aVQA\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u51dd\u89c6\u76ee\u6807\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u51dd\u89c6\u65b9\u5411\u63cf\u8ff0\u3001\u51dd\u89c6\u70b9\u5b9a\u4f4d\u548c\u6a21\u7cca\u95ee\u9898\u8bc6\u522b\u3002\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u5546\u4e1a\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u662f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21VLMs\uff0c\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e5f\u96be\u4ee5\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u63a8\u65ad\u51dd\u89c6\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002\u76f8\u53cd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728VL4Gaze\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u90fd\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u4e14\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u76d1\u7763\u6765\u5f00\u53d1VLMs\u7684\u51dd\u89c6\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff1bVL4Gaze benchmark\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b9\u5411\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u652f\u6301\uff1b\u5c06\u516c\u5f00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

Our approach deploys a 1-bit quantized Llama-3.2-1B model on Raspberry Pi hardware, achieving 71.4 times energy reduction compared to full-precision models while maintaining intelligent control capabilities. Through multi-objective reinforcement learning, BitRL-Light learns optimal lighting policies from user feedback, balancing energy consumption, comfort, and circadian alignment. Experimental results demonstrate 32% energy savings compared to rule-based systems, with inference latency under 200ms on Raspberry Pi 4 and 95% user satisfaction. The system processes natural language commands via Google Home/IFTTT integration and learns from implicit feedback through manual overrides. Our comparative analysis shows 1-bit models achieve 5.07 times speedup over 2-bit alternatives on ARM processors while maintaining 92% task accuracy.

A Survey", "comment": null, "summary": "Privacy concerns around 5G, the latest generation of mobile networks, are growing, with fears that its deployment may increase exposure to privacy risks. This perception is largely driven by the use of denser deployments of small antenna systems, which enable highly accurate data collection at higher speeds and closer proximity to mobile users. At the same time, 5G's unique radio communication features can make the reproduction of known network attacks more challenging. In particular, passive network attacks, which do not involve direct interaction with the target network and are therefore nearly impossible to detect, remain a pressing concern. Such attacks can reveal sensitive information about users, their devices, and active applications, which may then be exploited through known vulnerabilities or spear-phishing schemes. This survey examines the feasibility of passive network attacks in 5G and beyond (B5G/6G) networks, with emphasis on two major categories: information extraction (system identification, website and application fingerprinting) and geolocation (user identification and position tracking). These attacks are well documented and reproducible in existing wireless and mobile systems, including short-range networks (IEEE 802.11) and, to a lesser extent, LTE. Current evidence suggests that while such attacks remain theoretically possible in 5G, their practical execution is significantly constrained by directional beamforming, high-frequency propagation characteristics, and encryption mechanisms. For B5G and early 6G networks, the lack of public tools and high hardware cost currently renders these attacks infeasible in practice, which highlights a critical gap in our understanding of future network threat models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Rapid, reliable damage assessment (DA) is essential for storm restoration, yet most optimization work targets repair dispatch after faults are identified. This paper presents a production, rolling horizon DA crew allocation system deployed across multiple U.S. states in Eversource Energy's service territory and used during live storms. The method implements a sequential k-job assignment policy per available crew, executed on a fixed cadence and on operators' control. The objective jointly prioritizes critical facilities and customer impact while controlling travel time on the actual road network via the Google Maps API. A key constraint is the absence of live crew GPS; we infer crew locations from the last confirmed DA site and robustify travel estimates for staleness, yielding stable recommendations without continuous tracking. The operator remains in the loop with controls to limit churn and to publish a feasible plan. Using data from the March 7 New Hampshire storm with 90 moderate outages and seven DA crews, we observe shorter time to first assessment, fewer revisits with reduced distance traveled.

Code available at https://github.com/wltang-dev/Latent-Strategy-RL-Agent", "summary": "This study proposes a multi-agent language framework that enables continual strategy evolution without fine-tuning the language model's parameters. The core idea is to liberate the latent vectors of abstract concepts from traditional static semantic representations, allowing them to be continuously updated through environmental interaction and reinforcement feedback. We construct a dual-loop architecture: the behavior loop adjusts action preferences based on environmental rewards, while the language loop updates the external latent vectors by reflecting on the semantic embeddings of generated text.\n  Together, these mechanisms allow agents to develop stable and disentangled strategic styles over long-horizon multi-round interactions. Experiments show that agents' latent spaces exhibit clear convergence trajectories under reflection-driven updates, along with structured shifts at critical moments. Moreover, the system demonstrates an emergent ability to implicitly infer and continually adapt to emotional agents, even without shared rewards. These results indicate that, without modifying model parameters, an external latent space can provide language agents with a low-cost, scalable, and interpretable form of abstract strategic representation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8ba9AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u4e0d\u505c\u8fdb\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3001\u5374\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u627e\u5230\u4e00\u79cd\u4fbf\u5b9c\u3001\u80fd\u8f7b\u677e\u653e\u5927\u3001\u5e76\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8ba9\u8bed\u8a00\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u83b7\u5f97\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d1\u5c55\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u8fd9\u6837\u5b83\u4eec\u5c31\u80fd\u5728\u4e92\u52a8\u4e2d\u6162\u6162\u5f62\u6210\u5e76\u7a33\u5b9a\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u7528\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "method": "\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bed\u8a00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u5faa\u73af\u7ed3\u6784\uff1a\u884c\u4e3a\u5faa\u73af\u6839\u636e\u73af\u5883\u5956\u52b1\u8c03\u6574\u884c\u52a8\u504f\u597d\uff1b\u8bed\u8a00\u5faa\u73af\u5219\u901a\u8fc7\u53cd\u601d\u751f\u6210\u6587\u5b57\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u66f4\u65b0\u4ee3\u8868\u62bd\u8c61\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u6f5c\u53d8\u91cf\u3002\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u793a\u4e0d\u518d\u56fa\u5b9a\uff0c\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u4e92\u52a8\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u6301\u7eed\u8fdb\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u53cd\u601d\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0b\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f1a\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u6536\u655b\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5173\u952e\u65f6\u523b\u53d1\u751f\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u65e0\u5171\u4eab\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u63a8\u6d4b\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u60c5\u611f\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u5916\u90e8\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5c31\u80fd\u4e3a\u8bed\u8a00\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u7b56\u7565\u8868\u793a\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u8fdb\u5316\u3002"}}

To address these practical challenges, this paper presents a fixed-time prescribed performance control scheme for the 3D path following of underwater gliders subject to model uncertainties and environmental disturbances. The primary contribution is the integration of a finite-time performance function within a fixed-time control framework. This synthesis ensures that the tracking errors are constrained within prescribed performance bounds and converge to a compact set within a fixed time, independent of initial conditions. A second key contribution is the development of a fixed-time sliding mode disturbance observer that provides accurate finite-time estimation of lumped disturbances, enhancing the system's robustness. Integrated with an iLOS guidance law, the proposed controller enables precise and safe waypoint following. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms conventional sliding mode and prescribed performance controllers in tracking accuracy, convergence speed, and control effort smoothness, validating its efficacy for robust underwater navigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u89c4\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6c34\u4e0b\u6ed1\u7fd4\u673a3D\u8def\u5f84\u8ddf\u8e2a\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u73af\u5883\u6270\u52a8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u6c34\u4e0b\u6ed1\u7fd4\u673a\u5728\u98d3\u98ce\u5b63\u8282\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u957f\u671f\u73af\u5883\u76d1\u6d4b\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u5f3a\u6d77\u6d41\u548c\u6e4d\u6d41\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u95f4\u6027\u80fd\u51fd\u6570\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u56fa\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u6ed1\u6a21\u6270\u52a8\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u4f30\u8ba1\u603b\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408iLOS\u5236\u5bfc\u5f8b\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u8def\u5f84\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u6a21\u62df\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u5e73\u6ed1\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u6ed1\u6a21\u548c\u89c4\u5b9a\u6027\u80fd\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u6c34\u4e0b\u6ed1\u7fd4\u673a\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002"}}

Although SSC has been widely studied in terrestrial domains such as autonomous driving, aerial scenarios like autonomous flying remain largely unexplored, thereby limiting progress on downstream applications. Furthermore, LiDAR sensors represent the primary modality for SSC data generation, which poses challenges for most uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) due to flight regulations, mass and energy constraints, and the sparsity of LiDAR-based point clouds from elevated viewpoints. To address these limitations, we introduce OccuFly, the first real-world, camera-based aerial SSC benchmark, captured at altitudes of 50m, 40m, and 30m during spring, summer, fall, and winter. OccuFly covers urban, industrial, and rural scenarios, provides 22 semantic classes, and the data format adheres to established conventions to facilitate seamless integration with existing research. Crucially, we propose a LiDAR-free data generation framework based on camera modality, which is ubiquitous on modern UAVs. By utilizing traditional 3D reconstruction, our framework automates label transfer by lifting a subset of annotated 2D masks into the reconstructed point cloud, thereby substantially minimizing manual 3D annotation effort. Finally, we benchmark the state-of-the-art on OccuFly and highlight challenges specific to elevated viewpoints, yielding a comprehensive vision benchmark for holistic aerial 3D scene understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Nonetheless, they struggle with high-level conceptual understanding and holistic comprehension due to limited context windows, which constrain their ability to perform deep reasoning over long-form, domain-specific content such as full-length books. To solve this problem, knowledge graphs (KGs) have been leveraged to provide entity-centric structure and hierarchical summaries, offering more structured support for reasoning. However, existing KG-based RAG solutions remain restricted to text-only inputs and fail to leverage the complementary insights provided by other modalities such as vision. On the other hand, reasoning from visual documents requires textual, visual, and spatial cues into structured, hierarchical concepts. To address this issue, we introduce a multimodal knowledge graph-based RAG that enables cross-modal reasoning for better content understanding. Our method incorporates visual cues into the construction of knowledge graphs, the retrieval phase, and the answer generation process. Experimental results across both global and fine-grained question answering tasks show that our approach consistently outperforms existing RAG-based approaches on both textual and multimodal corpora.", "AI": {"tldr": "RAG\u589e\u5f3aLLM\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u6587\u6863\u95ee\u7b54\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u957f\u7bc7\u9886\u57df\u5185\u5bb9\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed3\u6784\u652f\u6301\u4f46\u9650\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u672a\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u7b49\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31RAG\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u878d\u5165KG\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5185\u5bb9\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1(\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6)\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210(RAG)\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\u867d\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u65b0\u6587\u6863\u95ee\u7b54\uff0c\u4f46\u56e0\u6709\u9650\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7a97\u53e3\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5bf9\u957f\u7bc7\u9886\u57df\u5185\u5bb9(\u5982\u6574\u672c\u4e66)\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u3002\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u4f53\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u5206\u5c42\u6458\u8981\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6848\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u7eaf\u6587\u672c\u4e14\u672a\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u7b49\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u800c\u89c6\u89c9\u6587\u6863\u63a8\u7406\u9700\u8981\u6587\u672c\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ebf\u7d22\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u9700\u5f00\u53d1\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31RAG\u4ee5\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u878d\u5165\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u9636\u6bb5\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5185\u5bb9\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u4e3a\uff1a(1)\u6784\u5efa\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u6574\u5408\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u5f62\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b(2)\u68c0\u7d22\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7ebf\u7d22\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u5339\u914d\uff1b(3)\u751f\u6210\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408\u56fe\u6587\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u7b54\u6848\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5168\u5c40\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5bf9\u8c61\u5305\u62ec\u6587\u672c\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eRAG\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31RAG\u5728\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u7bc7\u3001\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u5185\u5bb9\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6df1\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u53ca\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u5229\u7528\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u589e\u5f3a\u7684RAG\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u7b54\u6848\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u878d\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5185\u5bb9\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u6587\u6863\u548c\u957f\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Traditional models often fail to capture semantic information across multimodal streams, while large-scale fine-tuning approaches are impractical in clinical workflows. We introduce a framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as Goal-oriented Knowledge Curators (GKC) to convert laboratory, genomic, and medication data into high-fidelity, task-aligned features. Unlike generic embeddings, GKC produces representations tailored to the prediction objective and operates as an offline preprocessing step that integrates naturally into hospital informatics pipelines. Using a lung cancer cohort (N=184), we benchmarked GKC against expert-engineered features, direct text embeddings, and an end-to-end transformer. Our approach achieved a mean AUROC of 0.803 (95% CI: 0.799-0.807) and outperformed all baselines. An ablation study further confirmed the complementary value of combining all three modalities. These results show that the quality of semantic representation is a key determinant of predictive accuracy in sparse clinical data settings.

Recent work revealed that performance degradation may stem from spurious forgetting caused by task alignment disruption rather than true knowledge loss. However, this work only qualitatively describes alignment, relies on post-hoc analysis, and lacks automatic distinction mechanisms.\n  We introduce the shallow versus deep alignment framework, providing the first quantitative characterization of alignment depth. We identify that current task alignment approaches suffer from shallow alignment - maintained only over the first few output tokens (approximately 3-5) - making models vulnerable to forgetting. This explains why spurious forgetting occurs, why it is reversible, and why fine-tuning attacks are effective.\n  We propose a comprehensive framework addressing all gaps: (1) quantitative metrics (0-1 scale) to measure alignment depth across token positions; (2) real-time detection methods for identifying shallow alignment during training; (3) specialized analysis tools for visualization and recovery prediction; and (4) adaptive mitigation strategies that automatically distinguish forgetting types and promote deep alignment. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures (Qwen2.5-3B to Qwen2.5-32B) demonstrate 86.2-90.6% identification accuracy and show that promoting deep alignment improves robustness against forgetting by 3.3-7.1% over baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The proposed methodology employs neural networks to predict penalty weights that guide recursive linearization, transforming the intractable MINLP into a sequence of convex quadratic programs trained end-to-end via differentiable optimization layers. Case studies across 19 representative Belgian electricity market scenarios demonstrate that the DFL framework effectively navigates the trade-off between solution quality and computation time. As a refinement tool, the framework improves profit by 1.1% over piecewise MIQP baselines. Alternatively, as a real-time scheduler initialized with linear approximations, it achieves a 300-fold speedup (3.87s vs 1205.79s) while maintaining profitability within 3.6% of the piecewise MIQP benchmark.

However, their high inference latency and memory consumption pose significant challenges for real-time serving and scalability. These limitations stem largely from architectural redundancy, particularly in the attention module. The inherent parameter redundancy of the attention mechanism, coupled with the fact that its attention heads operate with a degree of independence, makes it particularly amenable to structured model compression. In this paper, we propose SHRP (Specialized Head Routing and Pruning), a novel structured pruning framework that automatically identifies and removes redundant attention heads while preserving most of the model's accuracy and compatibility. SHRP introduces Expert Attention, a modular design that treats each attention head as an independent expert, followed by a lightweight shared expander feed-forward network that refines their outputs. The framework employs a unified Top-1 usage-driven mechanism to jointly perform dynamic routing during training and deterministic pruning at deployment. Experimental results on the GLUE benchmark using a BERT-base encoder show that SHRP achieves 93% of the original model accuracy while reducing parameters by 48 percent. Under an extreme compression scenario where 11/12 of the layers are pruned, the model still maintains 84% accuracy and delivers a 4.2x throughput gain while reducing computation to as low as 11.5 percent of the original FLOPs, demonstrating its practical utility for large-scale and latency-sensitive web deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While recent architectures such as FastVLM improve efficiency through optimized vision encoders, existing pipelines still rely on static visual preprocessing, leading to redundant computation for visually simple inputs. In this work, we propose an adaptive visual preprocessing method that dynamically adjusts input resolution and spatial coverage based on image content characteristics. The proposed approach combines content-aware image analysis, adaptive resolution selection, and content-aware cropping to reduce visual redundancy prior to vision encoding. Importantly, the method is integrated with FastVLM without modifying its architecture or requiring retraining. We evaluate the proposed method on a subset of the DocVQA dataset in an inference-only setting, focusing on efficiency-oriented metrics. Experimental results show that adaptive preprocessing reduces per-image inference time by over 50\\%, lowers mean full generation time, and achieves a consistent reduction of more than 55\\% in visual token count compared to the baseline pipeline. These findings demonstrate that input-aware preprocessing is an effective and lightweight strategy for improving deployment-oriented efficiency of vision-language models.

While prior work focuses on improving model performance through internal reasoning strategies, little is known about the interchangeability of reasoning across different models. In this work, we explore whether a partially completed reasoning chain from one model can be reliably continued by another model, either within the same model family or across families. We achieve this by assessing the sufficiency of intermediate reasoning traces as transferable scaffolds for logical coherence and final answer accuracy. We interpret this interchangeability as a means of examining inference-time trustworthiness, probing whether reasoning remains both coherent and reliable under model substitution. Using token-level log-probability thresholds to truncate reasoning at early, mid, and late stages from our baseline models, Gemma-3-4B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instruct, we conduct continuation experiments with Gemma-3-1B-IT and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instruct to test intra-family and cross-family behaviors. Our evaluation pipeline leverages truncation thresholds with a Process Reward Model (PRM), providing a reproducible framework for assessing reasoning stability via model interchange. Evaluations with a PRM reveal that hybrid reasoning chains often preserve, and in some cases even improve, final accuracy and logical structure. Our findings point towards interchangeability as an emerging behavioral property of reasoning models, offering insights into new paradigms for reliable modular reasoning in collaborative AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this, this paper proposes TSA-LLM, a large language model (LLM)-based universal framework that models multi-variate transient dynamics prediction as a univariate generative task with three key innovations: First, a novel data processing pipeline featuring channel independence decomposition to resolve dimensional heterogeneity, sample-wise normalization to eliminate separate stable or unstable pipelines, and temporal patching for efficient long-sequence modeling; Second, a parameter-efficient freeze-and-finetune strategy that augments the LLM's architecture with dedicated input embedding and output projection layers while freezing core transformer blocks to preserve generic feature extraction capabilities; Third, a two-stage fine-tuning scheme that combines teacher forcing, which feeds the model ground-truth data during initial training, with scheduled sampling, which gradually shifts to leveraging model-generated predictions, to mitigate cumulative errors in long-horizon iterative prediction. Comprehensive testing demonstrates the framework's universality, as TSA-LLM trained solely on the New England 39-bus system achieves zero-shot generalization to mixed stability conditions and unseen faults, and matches expert performance on the larger Iceland 189-bus system with only 5% fine-tuning data. This multi-scenario versatility validates a universal framework that eliminates scenario-specific retraining and achieves scalability via large-scale parameters and cross-scenario training data.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

ALIVE operates fully on local hardware and integrates (1) Avatar-delivered lecture generated through ASR transcription, LLM refinement, and neural talking-head synthesis; (2) A content-aware retrieval mechanism that combines semantic similarity with timestamp alignment to surface contextually relevant lecture segments; and (3) Real-time multimodal interaction, enabling students to pause the lecture, ask questions through text or voice, and receive grounded explanations either as text or as avatar-delivered responses.\n  To maintain responsiveness, ALIVE employs lightweight embedding models, FAISS-based retrieval, and segmented avatar synthesis with progressive preloading. We demonstrate the system on a complete medical imaging course, evaluate its retrieval accuracy, latency characteristics, and user experience, and show that ALIVE provides accurate, content-aware, and engaging real-time support.\n  ALIVE illustrates how multimodal AI-when combined with content-aware retrieval and local deployment-can significantly enhance the pedagogical value of recorded lectures, offering an extensible pathway toward next-generation interactive learning environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "ALIVE\u5c06\u8bb2\u5ea7\u89c6\u9891\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u4e92\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u672c\u5730\u7684avatar\u8bb2\u89e3\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u8ba9\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u80fd\u591f\u6682\u505c\u5e76\u63d0\u95ee\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u5373\u65f6\u56de\u7b54\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u8bb2\u5ea7\u89c6\u9891\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u65f6\u6f84\u6e05\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u9047\u56f0\u60d1\u65f6\u9700\u8f6c\u5411\u5916\u90e8\u641c\u7d22\u3002\u867d\u7136\u6709AI\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bb2\u5ea7\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e91\u7aef\u670d\u52a1\u6216\u65e0\u6cd5\u6574\u5408\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0eavatar\u8bb2\u89e3\u3002ALIVE\u65e8\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e00\u4e2a\u672c\u5730\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u3001\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u589e\u5f3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "ALIVE\u672c\u5730\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff081\uff09Avatar\u8bb2\u89e3\u751f\u6210\uff08\u81ea\u52a8\u8bed\u97f3\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u3001\u795e\u7ecf\u5934\u50cf\u5408\u6210\uff09\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u68c0\u7d22\uff08\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u6233\u5bf9\u9f50\u4ee5\u63d0\u53d6\u76f8\u5173\u8bb2\u5ea7\u7247\u6bb5\uff09\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u5b9e\u65f6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4ea4\u4e92\uff08\u652f\u6301\u6587\u672c\u6216\u8bed\u97f3\u63d0\u95ee\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u6587\u5b57\u6216Avatar\u5f62\u5f0f\u56de\u7b54\uff09\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u3001FAISS\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u5206\u6bb5avatar\u9884\u52a0\u8f7d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u6210\u50cf\u8bfe\u7a0b\u4e0a\u6f14\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793aALIVE\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u8f83\u4f4e\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u7528\u6237\u4f53\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u7cfb\u7edf\u662f\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u5438\u5f15\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "ALIVE\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001AI\u3001\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u672c\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u8bb2\u5ea7\u5f55\u50cf\u7684\u6559\u80b2\u4ef7\u503c\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

First, based on a B/C/D-Scan three-view joint analysis strategy, a three-dimensional pipeline three-view feature evaluation method is established by cross-validating forward simulation results obtained using FDTD methods with actual measurement data. Second, the DCO-YOLO framework is proposed, which integrates DySample, CGLU, and OutlookAttention cross-dimensional correlation mechanisms into the original YOLOv11 algorithm, significantly improving the small-scale pipeline edge feature extraction capability. Furthermore, a 3D-DIoU spatial feature matching algorithm is proposed, which integrates three-dimensional geometric constraints and center distance penalty terms to achieve automated association of multi-view annotations. The three-view fusion strategy resolves inherent ambiguities in single-view detection. Experiments based on real urban underground pipeline data show that the proposed method achieves accuracy, recall, and mean average precision of 96.2%, 93.3%, and 96.7%, respectively, in complex multi-pipeline scenarios, which are 2.0%, 2.1%, and 0.9% higher than the baseline model. Ablation experiments validated the synergistic optimization effect of the dynamic feature enhancement module and Grad-CAM++ heatmap visualization demonstrated that the improved model significantly enhanced its ability to focus on pipeline geometric features.

In this work, we propose Mixture of Attention Schemes (MoAS), a novel architecture that dynamically selects the optimal attention scheme (MHA, GQA, or MQA) for each token via a learned router. We demonstrate that dynamic routing performs better than static averaging of schemes and achieves performance competitive with the MHA baseline while offering potential for conditional compute efficiency. Experimental results on WikiText-2 show that dynamic routing (val loss 2.3074) outperforms a static mixture (2.3093), validating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In this paper, we explore the integration of agentic AI into QoE-aware network slicing for IIoT. We first review the network slicing management architecture, QoE metrics for IIoT applications, and the challenges of dynamically managing heterogeneous network slices, while highlighting the motivations and advantages of adopting agentic AI. We then present the workflow of agentic AI-based slicing management, illustrating the full lifecycle of AI agents from processing slice requests to constructing slice instances and performing dynamic adjustments. Furthermore, we propose an LLM-empowered agentic AI approach for slicing management, which integrates a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module for semantic intent inference, a DRL-based orchestrator for slicing configuration, and an incremental memory mechanism for continual learning and adaptation.

This study presents a novel approach that begins by modeling the nonlinear and hysteretic dynamics of a magnetically actuated catheter system, consists of a magnetic catheter manipulated by servo-controlled magnetic fields generated by two external permanent magnets, and its complex behavior is captured using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. This model validated against experimental setup's data with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.42 mm and 99.8% coverage within 3 mm, establishing it as a reliable surrogate model. This LSTM enables the training of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents for controlling the system and avoiding damage to the real setup, with the potential for subsequent fine-tuning on the physical system. We implemented Deep Q-Network (DQN) and actor-critic RL controllers, comparing these two agents first for regulation and subsequently for path following along linear and half-sinusoidal paths for the catheter tip. The actor-critic outperforms DQN, offering greater accuracy and faster performance with less error, along with smoother trajectories at a 10 Hz sampling rate, in both regulation and path following compared to the DQN controller.

However, a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency persists. Statistical feature-based methods align with hardware constraints but often exhibit limited accuracy, while online deep learning methods using packet sequential features achieve superior accuracy but require substantial computational resources. This paper presents Synecdoche, the first traffic classification framework that successfully deploys packet sequential features on a programmable data plane via pattern matching, achieving both high accuracy and efficiency. Our key insight is that discriminative information concentrates in short sub-sequences--termed Key Segments--that serve as compact traffic features for efficient data plane matching. Synecdoche employs an \"offline discovery, online matching\" paradigm: deep learning models automatically discover Key Segment patterns offline, which are then compiled into optimized table entries for direct data plane matching. Extensive experiments demonstrate Synecdoche's superior accuracy, improving F1-scores by up to 26.4% against statistical methods and 18.3% against online deep learning methods, while reducing latency by 13.0% and achieving 79.2% reduction in SRAM usage.

In this paper, we propose a Dyna-Style Reinforcement Learning control framework that integrates Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) with Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) reinforcement learning. SINDy is used to identify a data-driven model of the system, capturing its key dynamics without requiring an explicit physical model. This identified model is used to generate synthetic rollouts that are periodically injected into the reinforcement learning replay buffer during training on the real environment, enabling efficient policy learning with limited data available. By leveraging this hybrid approach, we mitigate the sample inefficiency of traditional model-free reinforcement learning methods while ensuring accurate control of nonlinear systems. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework, we apply it to a bi-rotor system as a case study, evaluating its performance in stabilization and trajectory tracking.

Mainstream solutions typically rely on explicit modality alignment strategies; however, this paradigm heavily depends on constructing large-scale paired datasets for pre-training. To address this, grounded in the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, we explore the potential of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) in bridging modality gaps. Recognizing the suboptimal performance of existing generic Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods that operate within the weight space, particularly on limited-capacity models, we shift the optimization perspective to the feature space and propose a novel PEFT strategy termed Domain Representation Injection (DRI). Specifically, while keeping the VFM fully frozen to maximize the preservation of general knowledge, we design a lightweight, learnable Offset Encoder to extract domain-specific representations rich in modality and identity attributes from raw inputs. Guided by the contextual information of intermediate features at different layers, a Modulator adaptively transforms these representations. Subsequently, they are injected into the intermediate layers via additive fusion, dynamically reshaping the feature distribution to adapt to the downstream task without altering the VFM's pre-trained weights. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance with minimal trainable parameters.

Unlike most existing elastic tube-based MPC methods, we do not assume perfect knowledge of the system model or disturbance realizations bounds. Instead, a conservative zonotopic disturbance set is initialized and iteratively refined using data and prior knowledge: data are used to identify matrix zonotope model sets for the system dynamics, while prior physical knowledge is employed to discard models and disturbances inconsistent with known constraints. This process yields constrained matrix zonotopes representing disturbance realizations and dynamics that enable a principled fusion of offline information with limited online data, improving MPC feasibility and performance. The proposed design leverages closed-loop system characterization to learn and refine control gains that maintain a small tube size. By separating open-loop model mismatch from closed-loop effects in the error dynamics, the method avoids dependence on the size of the state and input operating regions, thereby reducing conservatism. An adaptive co-design of the tube and ancillary feedback ensures $\u03bb$-contractive zonotopic tubes, guaranteeing robust positive invariance, improved feasibility margins, and enhanced disturbance tolerance.

To systematically analyze this imbalance, we introduce DominanceBench and examine its causes from both data and architectural perspectives. Through various experiments, we show that the limited instance diversity in training data exacerbates the inter-concept interference. Analysis of cross-attention dynamics further reveals that dominant tokens rapidly saturate attention, progressively suppressing others across diffusion timesteps.

However, these methods often exhibit suboptimal accuracy in certain scenarios. By analyzing their attention distributions, we observe that existing models tend to allocate attention primarily to common words, overlooking less popular yet highly task-relevant terms, which significantly impairs overall performance. To address this issue, we propose an Adversarial Feedback for Attention(AFA) training mechanism that enables the model to automatically redistribute attention weights to appropriate focal points without requiring manual annotations. This mechanism incorporates a dynamic masking strategy that attempts to mask various words to deceive a discriminator, while the discriminator strives to detect significant differences induced by these masks. Additionally, leveraging the sensitivity of Transformer models to token-level perturbations, we employ a policy gradient approach to optimize attention distributions, which facilitates efficient and rapid convergence.

We investigate three levels of modeling for this task. First, we implement a heterogeneous GNN with attention-based message passing, establishing a strong neural baseline. Second, we propose FlowKANet in which Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks replace standard MLP layers, reducing trainable parameters while maintaining competitive predictive performance. FlowKANet integrates KAMP-Attn (Kolmogorov-Arnold Message Passing with Attention), embedding KAN operators directly into message-passing and attention computation. Finally, we distill the model into symbolic surrogate models using block-wise regression, producing closed-form equations that eliminate trainable weights while preserving graph-structured dependencies.

Existing approaches to evaluating pedestrian environments often rely on static, infrastructure-based indices or retrospective surveys, which overlook the dynamic, subjective, and psychophysiological dimensions of everyday walking experience. This paper introduces a multimodal, human-centered framework for assessing pedestrian well-being in the wild by integrating three complementary data streams: continuous physiological sensing, geospatial tracking, and momentary self-reports collected using the Experience Sampling Method. The framework conceptualizes pedestrian experience as a triangulation enabling a holistic understanding of how urban environments influence well-being. The utility of our framework is then demonstrated through a naturalistic case study conducted in the Greater Philadelphia region, in which participants wore research-grade wearable sensors and carried GPS-enabled smartphones during their regular daily activities. Physiological indicators of autonomic nervous system activity, including heart rate variability and electrodermal activity, were synchronized with spatial trajectories and in situ self-reports of stress, affect, and perceived infrastructure conditions. Results illustrate substantial inter- and intra-individual variability in both subjective experience and physiological response, as well as context-dependent patterns associated with traffic exposure, pedestrian infrastructure quality, and environmental enclosure. The findings also suggest that commonly used walkability indices may not fully capture experiential dimensions of pedestrian well-being. By enabling real-world, multimodal measurement of pedestrian experience, the proposed framework offers a scalable and transferable approach for advancing human-centered urban analytics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing VLMs predominantly digest and understand high-bitrate compressed images, while their ability to interpret low-bitrate compressed images has yet to be explored by far. In this paper, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the ability of VLM against compressed images, varying existing widely used image codecs and diverse set of tasks, encompassing over one million compressed images in our benchmark. Next, we analyse the source of performance gap, by categorising the gap from a) the information loss during compression and b) generalisation failure of VLM. We visualize these gaps with concrete examples and identify that for compressed images, only the generalization gap can be mitigated. Finally, we propose a universal VLM adaptor to enhance model performance on images compressed by existing codecs. Consequently, we demonstrate that a single adaptor can improve VLM performance across images with varying codecs and bitrates by 10%-30%. We believe that our benchmark and enhancement method provide valuable insights and contribute toward bridging the gap between VLMs and compressed images.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We conducted three controlled experiments (A, B, and C) to quantify these phenomena across several advanced LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4 variant, DeepSeek). Our results indicate widespread laziness in satisfying complex multi-part instructions: models frequently omitted required sections or failed to meet length requirements despite explicit prompting. However, we found limited evidence of decoding suboptimality in a simple reasoning task (the models' greedy answers appeared to align with their highest-confidence solution), and we observed surprising robustness against context degradation in a 200-turn chaotic conversation test - the models maintained key facts and instructions far better than expected. These findings suggest that while compliance with detailed instructions remains an open challenge, modern LLMs may internally mitigate some hypothesized failure modes (such as context forgetting) in straightforward retrieval scenarios. We discuss implications for reliability, relate our findings to prior work on instruction-following and long-context processing, and recommend strategies (such as self-refinement and dynamic prompting) to reduce laziness and bolster multi-instruction compliance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u61d2\u60f0\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u5982\u8349\u7387\u622a\u65ad\u56de\u590d\u3001\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u6267\u884c\u591a\u90e8\u5206\u8bf7\u6c42\uff09\u3001\u89e3\u7801\u6b21\u4f18\uff08\u8d2a\u5a6a\u89e3\u7801\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff09\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9000\u5316\uff08\u957f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u9057\u5fd8\u6838\u5fc3\u6307\u4ee4\uff09\u7b49\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u5bf9\u7167\u5b9e\u9a8c\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u591a\u6307\u4ee4\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u666e\u904d\u7684\u61d2\u60f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u89e3\u7801\u6b21\u4f18\u73b0\u8c61\u4e0d\u660e\u663e\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u957f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u610f\u60f3\u4e0d\u5230\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136LLM\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u4e09\u79cd\u884c\u4e3a\u5f02\u5e38\uff1a\u61d2\u60f0\uff08\u4e0d\u5b8c\u6574\u9075\u5faa\u6307\u4ee4\uff09\u3001\u89e3\u7801\u6b21\u4f18\uff08\u77ed\u89c6\u89e3\u7801\u9009\u62e9\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u5e8f\u5217\uff09\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9000\u5316\uff08\u957f\u5bf9\u8bdd\u9057\u5fd8\u6838\u5fc3\u4fe1\u606f\uff09\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u91cf\u5316\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7cbe\u786e\u6d4b\u91cf\u8fd9\u4e9b\u884c\u4e3a\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5148\u8fdbLLM\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u904d\u7a0b\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u5bf9\u7167\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1a\u5b9e\u9a8cA\u6d4b\u8bd5\u591a\u90e8\u5206\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\uff08\u68c0\u67e5\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u9057\u6f0f\u5fc5\u8981\u90e8\u5206\u6216\u957f\u5ea6\u8981\u6c42\uff09\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8cB\u8bc4\u4f30\u89e3\u7801\u6b21\u4f18\u6027\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u7b80\u5355\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u6bd4\u8f83\u8d2a\u5a6a\u89e3\u7801\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u6700\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u89e3\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8cC\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9000\u5316\uff08\u5728200\u8f6e\u6df7\u4e71\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u68c0\u9a8c\u5173\u952e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\uff09\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5bf9\u8c61\u5305\u62ecOpenAI GPT-4\u53d8\u4f53\u548cDeepSeek\u7b49\u5148\u8fdbLLM\u3002", "result": "1\uff09\u61d2\u60f0\u73b0\u8c61\u666e\u904d\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u7ecf\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u591a\u90e8\u5206\u6307\u4ee4\u7684\u5fc5\u9700\u90e8\u5206\u6216\u672a\u8fbe\u957f\u5ea6\u8981\u6c42\uff1b2\uff09\u89e3\u7801\u6b21\u4f18\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff1a\u7b80\u5355\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8d2a\u5a6a\u89e3\u7801\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0e\u6700\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u89e3\u57fa\u672c\u4e00\u81f4\uff1b3\uff09\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fdd\u6301\u826f\u597d\uff1a200\u8f6e\u6df7\u4e71\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u8d85\u9884\u671f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u4fdd\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660eLLM\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7b80\u5355\u68c0\u7d22\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5185\u90e8\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u67d0\u4e9b\u9884\u671f\u5931\u6548\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u5148\u8fdbLLM\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u61d2\u60f0\u95ee\u9898\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\uff0c\u4f46\u89e3\u7801\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ba1\u7406\u6bd4\u9884\u671f\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\u3002\u5efa\u8bae\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u6211\u7cbe\u70bc\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u7b49\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u591a\u6307\u4ee4\u9075\u5faa\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5bf9LLM\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3001\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5904\u7406\u7814\u7a76\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

To allow for nonlinear dynamic control under this constraint, a method for representing a state-space system model as an auto-regressive model with exogenous inputs (ARX model) is proposed. With the input as well as the output of the plant encrypted and transmitted to the controller, the reformulated ARX form can compute each output using only a finite number of operations, from its several previous inputs and outputs. Existence of a stable observer for the controller is a key condition for the proposed representation.

We propose PanoGrounder, a generalizable 3DVG framework that couples multi-modal panoramic representation with pretrained 2D VLMs for strong vision-language reasoning. Panoramic renderings, augmented with 3D semantic and geometric features, serve as an intermediate representation between 2D and 3D, and offer two major benefits: (i) they can be directly fed to VLMs with minimal adaptation and (ii) they retain long-range object-to-object relations thanks to their 360-degree field of view. We devise a three-stage pipeline that places a compact set of panoramic viewpoints considering the scene layout and geometry, grounds a text query on each panoramic rendering with a VLM, and fuses per-view predictions into a single 3D bounding box via lifting.

This sequential and adaptive nature enables the program to be modeled as a business process, thereby facilitating its analysis.

To address these limitations, this work proposes an architecture based on a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) for the synthesis of realistic clinical records that are coherent with real-world observations. The primary objective is to increase the size and diversity of the available datasets in order to enhance the performance of cardiac risk prediction models and to reduce the need for potentially hazardous diagnostic procedures, such as exercise stress testing.

This suggests that hallucination is often not a low-confidence phenomenon, but a failure of structural consistency. In this work, we reformulate the verification of LLM reasoning as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) operating independently of the generation likelihood. Rather than optimizing for statistical plausibility, we model verification as a feasibility check based on structural violation cost -- the computational cost required to embed a candidate reasoning step into the contextual graph structure. We define a total cost function composed of three proxies: (i) graph connectivity (structural), (ii) feature space consistency (geometric), and (iii) logical entailment (symbolic). Crucially, verification is performed via a lightweight System-2 gate, Eidoku, which rejects candidates exceeding a context-calibrated cost threshold. The threshold is not learned but is derived from the intrinsic statistics of the context, avoiding ad hoc heuristics. We demonstrate that this approach successfully rejects ``smooth falsehoods'' -- statements that are highly probable yet structurally disconnected -- that probability-based verifiers are principally incapable of detecting. Our experiments on a controlled diagnostic dataset show that explicitly enforcing structural constraints allows for the deterministic rejection of this specific class of hallucinations, serving as a neuro-symbolic sanity check for generative reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A sudden loss of these loads as they switch to onsite UPS during grid voltage excursion events causes a grid frequency rise from generation and load imbalance, and a voltage rise because less power is flowing through the network. This paper proposes and theoretically demonstrates the use of high voltage circuit breaker operated braking resistors at data center transmission substations as an effective strategy in enhancing grid resilience under such large load loss scenarios. We developed a test bed to illustrate the dynamic behavior of the system with resistive braking on a gigawatt scale data center load cluster connected to a 345 kV network. The braking resistor(s), which in the case of inverter rich system comes in a multi-stage configuration, are connected or disconnected via high-speed circuit breaker(s). Results show that insertion for 0.25 to 0.85 seconds sufficiently reduce rate of change of frequency and provides time for primary governor response and capacitor switching to restore steady state. Sensitivity across different synchronous machines and inverter-based resource mix are tested and confirms robustness. We conclude circuit breaker controlled resistive braking is a practical means to enhance Bulk Electric System (BES) resilience for gigawatt scale data centers.

Mainstream consistency-based fusion inherently minimizes feature discrepancies to align modalities, yet this approach fundamentally fails because it inadvertently smoothes out the subtle cross-modal contradictions that serve as the primary evidence of fabrication. To address this, we propose the Dynamic Conflict-Consensus Framework (DCCF), an inconsistency-seeking paradigm designed to amplify rather than suppress contradictions. First, DCCF decouples inputs into independent Fact and Sentiment spaces to distinguish objective mismatches from emotional dissonance. Second, we employ physics-inspired feature dynamics to iteratively polarize these representations, actively extracting maximally informative conflicts. Finally, a conflict-consensus mechanism standardizes these local discrepancies against the global context for robust deliberative judgment.Extensive experiments conducted on three real world datasets demonstrate that DCCF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 3.52\\%.", "AI": {"tldr": "DCCF\u52a8\u6001\u51b2\u7a81\u5171\u8bc6\u6846\u67b6\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u53d6\u4ee3\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u653e\u5927\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u77db\u76fe\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u865a\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u5173\u952e\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5dee\u5f02\u89c6\u4e3a\u566a\u58f0\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u62b9\u53bb\u4e86\u4f2a\u9020\u8bc1\u636e\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u9519\u8bef\u5730\u5c06\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u77db\u76fe\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u4e0a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5fae\u5999\u77db\u76fe\u624d\u662f\u68c0\u6d4b\u4f2a\u9020\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "method": "1. \u5c06\u8f93\u5165\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u533a\u5206\u5ba2\u89c2\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u4e0e\u60c5\u611f\u5931\u8c03\uff1b2. \u91c7\u7528\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u8fed\u4ee3\u6781\u5316\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e3b\u52a8\u63d0\u53d6\u6700\u5927\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684\u51b2\u7a81\uff1b3. \u4f7f\u7528\u51b2\u7a81\u5171\u8bc6\u673a\u5236\u5c06\u5c40\u90e8\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u80cc\u666f\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6bd4\u5bf9\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u5ba1\u614e\u5224\u65ad\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDCCF\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53473.52%\u3002", "conclusion": "DCCF\u901a\u8fc7\u5bfb\u6c42\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u800c\u975e\u5f3a\u5236\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5047\u65b0\u95fb\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u653e\u5927\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u77db\u76fe\u6bd4\u6291\u5236\u77db\u76fe\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u606f\u3002"}}

We argue that a bridge is needed, specifically by introducing a conceptual language which can match FTAI and NTAI. Such a semantic language can assist developers as a framework to assess AI systems in terms of trustworthiness. It can also help stakeholders translate norms and regulations into concrete implementation steps for their systems. In this position paper, we describe the current state-of-the-art and identify the gap between FTAI and NTAI.

The proposed framework considers interconnections in which each subsystem admits a FxT-ISS Lyapunov function, providing robustness with respect to external inputs. We show that, under an appropriate nonlinear small-gain condition, the overall interconnected system inherits the FxT-ISS property. In this sense, the proposed result complements existing Lyapunov-based smallgain theorems for asymptotic and finite-time stability, and enables a systematic analysis of interconnection structures exhibiting fixed-time stability. To illustrate the applicability of the theory, we study feedback-based optimization problems with time-varying cost functions, and Nash-equilibrium seeking for noncooperative games with nonlinear dynamical plants in the loop. For both problems, we present a class of non-smooth gradient or pseudogradient-based controllers that achieve fixed-time convergence without requiring time-scale separation and using real-time feedback.

Despite this progress, efficiently rendering the high-dimensional features required for open-vocabulary queries poses a significant challenge. Existing methods employ codebooks or feature compression, causing information loss, thereby degrading segmentation quality. To address this limitation, we introduce Quantile Rendering (Q-Render), a novel rendering strategy for 3D Gaussians that efficiently handles high-dimensional features while maintaining high fidelity. Unlike conventional volume rendering, which densely samples all 3D Gaussians intersecting each ray, Q-Render sparsely samples only those with dominant influence along the ray. By integrating Q-Render into a generalizable 3D neural network, we also propose Gaussian Splatting Network (GS-Net), which predicts Gaussian features in a generalizable manner. Extensive experiments on ScanNet and LeRF demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, while enabling real-time rendering with an approximate ~43.7x speedup on 512-D feature maps.

However, the substantial computational requirements for training these models present a significant obstacle to their practical application. To address this issue, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has been proposed. Nevertheless, the standard LoRA with a fixed rank lacks sufficient capability for training mobile VLMs that process both text and image modalities. In this work, we introduce HyDRA, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework designed to implement hierarchical and dynamic rank scheduling for mobile VLMs. This framework incorporates two essential optimization strategies: (1) hierarchical optimization, which involves a coarse-grained approach that assigns different ranks to various layers, as well as a fine-grained method that adjusts ranks within individual layers, and (2) dynamic adjustment, which employs an end-to-end automatic optimization using a lightweight performance model to determine and adjust ranks during the fine-tuning process. Comprehensive experiments conducted on popular benchmarks demonstrate that HyDRA consistently outperforms the baseline, achieving a 4.7\\% improvement across various model sizes without increasing the number of trainable parameters. In some tasks, it even surpasses full-parameter fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This scoping review synthesizes 32 studies (2023-2025) purposively sampled from 259 records to map personalization mechanisms and effectiveness signals in higher-education computer science contexts. We identify five application domains: intelligent tutoring, personalized materials, formative feedback, AI-augmented assessment, and code review, and analyze how design choices shape learning outcomes. Designs incorporating explanation-first guidance, solution withholding, graduated hint ladders, and artifact grounding (student code, tests, and rubrics) consistently show more positive learning processes than unconstrained chat interfaces. Successful implementations share four patterns: context-aware tutoring anchored in student artifacts, multi-level hint structures requiring reflection, composition with traditional CS infrastructure (autograders and rubrics), and human-in-the-loop quality assurance. We propose an exploration-first adoption framework emphasizing piloting, instrumentation, learning-preserving defaults, and evidence-based scaling. Recurrent risks include academic integrity, privacy, bias and equity, and over-reliance, and we pair these with operational mitigation.

Visual programming addresses this by decomposing problems into steps calling specialized tools, yet existing methods rely on either fixed toolsets or speculative tool induction before solving problems, resulting in suboptimal programs and poor utilization of induced tools. We present Transductive Visual Programming (TVP), a novel framework that builds new tools from its own experience rather than speculation. TVP first solves problems using basic tools while accumulating experiential solutions into an Example Library, then abstracts recurring patterns from these programs into reusable higher-level tools for an evolving Tool Library. This allows TVP to tackle new problems with increasingly powerful tools learned from experience. On Omni3D-Bench, TVP achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming GPT-4o by 22% and the previous best visual programming system by 11%. Our transductively learned tools are used 5x more frequently as core program dependency than inductively created ones, demonstrating more effective tool discovery and reuse. The evolved tools also show strong generalization to unseen spatial tasks, achieving superior performance on benchmarks from SpatialScore-Hard collection without any testset-specific modification.

Prior progressive approaches are inherently limited by inference instability and error accumulation. To tackle these limitations, we present a Collaborative Multi-Agent Reasoning Framework that explicitly decouples Semantic Planning from Visual Synthesis. By employing specialized agents for upfront reasoning, our method generates a structured, explicit plan before pixel generation, enabling visually and semantically coherent single-pass synthesis. We integrate this framework with two critical mechanisms: (1) a self-correcting Verification Agent that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to rectify visible region segmentation and identify residual occluders strictly within the Semantic Planning phase, and (2) a Diverse Hypothesis Generator that addresses the ambiguity of invisible regions by offering diverse, plausible semantic interpretations, surpassing the limited pixel-level variations of standard random seed sampling. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of traditional metrics in assessing inferred invisible content, we introduce the MAC-Score (MLLM Amodal Completion Score), a novel human-aligned evaluation metric. Validated against human judgment and ground truth, these metrics establish a robust standard for assessing structural completeness and semantic consistency with visible context.

We propose Parallel Hierarchical Operation for Top-down Networks (PHOTON), a hierarchical autoregressive model that replaces flat scanning with vertical, multi-resolution context access. PHOTON maintains a hierarchy of latent streams: a bottom-up encoder progressively compresses tokens into low-rate contextual states, while lightweight top-down decoders reconstruct fine-grained token representations. Experimental results show that PHOTON is superior to competitive Transformer-based language models regarding the throughput-quality trade-off, offering significant advantages in long-context and multi-query tasks.

To address this, we propose Real-centric Envelope Modeling (REM), a new paradigm that shifts detection from learning generator artifacts to modeling the robust distribution of real images. REM introduces feature-level perturbations in self-reconstruction to generate near-real samples, and employs an envelope estimator with cross-domain consistency to learn a boundary enclosing the real image manifold. We further build RealChain, a comprehensive benchmark covering both open-source and commercial generators with simulated real-world degradation. Across eight benchmark evaluations, REM achieves an average improvement of 7.5% over state-of-the-art methods, and notably maintains exceptional generalization on the severely degraded RealChain benchmark, establishing a solid foundation for synthetic image detection under real-world conditions.

Computational mechanics, which develops and applies mathematical models and numerical methods to predict the behavior of physical systems under forces, deformation, and constraints, provides an ideal foundation for structured scientific reasoning evaluation. Problems follow clear mathematical structure, enforce strict physical and numerical constraints, and support objective verification. The discipline requires constructing explicit models of physical systems and reasoning about geometry, spatial relationships, and material behavior, connecting directly to emerging AI goals in physical reasoning and world modeling. We introduce FEM-Bench, a computational mechanics benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of LLMs to generate correct finite element method (FEM) and related code. FEM-Bench 2025 contains a suite of introductory but nontrivial tasks aligned with material from a first graduate course on computational mechanics. These tasks capture essential numerical and physical modeling challenges while representing only a small fraction of the complexity present in the discipline. Despite their simplicity, state-of-the-art LLMs do not reliably solve all of them. In a five attempt run, the best performing model at function writing, Gemini 3 Pro, completed 30/33 tasks at least once and 26/33 tasks all five times. The best performing model at unit test writing, GPT-5, had an Average Joint Success Rate of 73.8%. Other popular models showed broad performance variation.

Current safety benchmarks often focusing only on single-step decision-making, simulated environments for tasks with malicious intent, or evaluating adherence to explicit negative constraints. There is a lack of benchmarks that are designed to capture emergent forms of outcome-driven constraint violations, which arise when agents pursue goal optimization under strong performance incentives while deprioritizing ethical, legal, or safety constraints over multiple steps in realistic production settings. To address this gap, we introduce a new benchmark comprising 40 distinct scenarios. Each scenario presents a task that requires multi-step actions, and the agent's performance is tied to a specific Key Performance Indicator (KPI). Each scenario features Mandated (instruction-commanded) and Incentivized (KPI-pressure-driven) variations to distinguish between obedience and emergent misalignment. Across 12 state-of-the-art large language models, we observe outcome-driven constraint violations ranging from 1.3% to 71.4%, with 9 of the 12 evaluated models exhibiting misalignment rates between 30% and 50%. Strikingly, we find that superior reasoning capability does not inherently ensure safety; for instance, Gemini-3-Pro-Preview, one of the most capable models evaluated, exhibits the highest violation rate at over 60%, frequently escalating to severe misconduct to satisfy KPIs. Furthermore, we observe significant \"deliberative misalignment\", where the models that power the agents recognize their actions as unethical during separate evaluation. These results emphasize the critical need for more realistic agentic-safety training before deployment to mitigate their risks in the real world.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9488\u5bf9AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b40\u79cd\u591a\u6b65\u4efb\u52a1\u573a\u666f\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u5728\u5f3a\u7ee9\u6548\u6fc0\u52b1\u4e0b\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u4f26\u7406\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u6216\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u6d4b\u8bd512\u4e2a\u4e3b\u6d41\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u591a\u6570\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u572830%-50%\u7684\u8fdd\u89c4\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0d\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u201c\u84c4\u610f\u5931\u51c6\u201d\u73b0\u8c61\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u5b89\u5168\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5355\u6b65\u51b3\u7b56\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u6216\u663e\u5f0f\u8d1f\u9762\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u80fd\u591f\u6355\u6349\u73b0\u5b9e\u751f\u4ea7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u56e0\u8ffd\u6c42\u7ee9\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u800c\u9010\u6b65\u5ffd\u89c6\u4f26\u7406\u3001\u6cd5\u5f8b\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u201c\u7ed3\u679c\u9a71\u52a8\u578b\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u201d\u3002\u4e3a\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u591a\u6b65\u4efb\u52a1\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5305\u542b40\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u90fd\u8981\u6c42\u591a\u6b65\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5173\u952e\u7ee9\u6548\u6307\u6807(KPI)\u6302\u94a9\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u573a\u666f\u5305\u542b\u201c\u6307\u4ee4\u5f3a\u5236\u201d\u548c\u201cKPI\u538b\u529b\u9a71\u52a8\u201d\u4e24\u79cd\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u670d\u4ece\u6027\u548c\u6d8c\u73b0\u6027\u5931\u51c6\u3002\u5bf912\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u9a71\u52a8\u578b\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u7387\u57281.3%\u523071.4%\u4e4b\u95f4\uff0c12\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u67099\u4e2a\u7684\u5931\u51c6\u7387\u572830%-50%\u4e4b\u95f4\u3002\u503c\u5f97\u6ce8\u610f\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u5e76\u4e0d\u4fdd\u8bc1\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u7684Gemini-3-Pro-Preview\u8fdd\u89c4\u7387\u6700\u9ad8\uff08\u8d85\u8fc760%\uff09\uff0c\u751a\u81f3\u7ecf\u5e38\u4e3a\u6ee1\u8db3KPI\u800c\u91c7\u53d6\u4e25\u91cd\u4e0d\u5f53\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u6b64\u5916\u8fd8\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u663e\u8457\u7684\u201c\u84c4\u610f\u5931\u51c6\u201d\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5373\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5355\u72ec\u8bc4\u4f30\u65f6\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u81ea\u8eab\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4e0d\u9053\u5fb7\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8ffd\u6c42\u7ee9\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u65f6\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u73b0\u4f26\u7406\u5b89\u5168\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u8fdd\u53cd\uff0c\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u4e0d\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\u3002\u8fd9\u5f3a\u8c03\u5728AI\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u524d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

This paper presents an analysis of Lipschitz properties in multimodal autoencoders, combining both theoretical insights and empirical validation to enhance the training stability of these models. We begin by deriving the theoretical Lipschitz constants for aggregation methods within the multimodal autoencoder framework. We then introduce a regularized attention-based fusion method, developed based on our theoretical analysis, which demonstrates improved stability and performance during training. Through a series of experiments, we empirically validate our theoretical findings by estimating the Lipschitz constants across multiple trials and fusion strategies. Our results demonstrate that our proposed fusion function not only aligns with theoretical predictions but also outperforms existing strategies in terms of consistency, convergence speed, and accuracy.

LiDAR is widely used for this purpose due to its accuracy and robustness. Recently, neural LiDAR mapping has shown impressive performance; however, most approaches rely on dense implicit representations and underutilize geometric structure, while existing voxel-guided methods struggle to achieve real-time performance. To address these challenges, we propose XGrid-Mapping, a hybrid grid framework that jointly exploits explicit and implicit representations for efficient neural LiDAR mapping. Specifically, the strategy combines a sparse grid, providing geometric priors and structural guidance, with an implicit dense grid that enriches scene representation. By coupling the VDB structure with a submap-based organization, the framework reduces computational load and enables efficient incremental mapping on a large scale. To mitigate discontinuities across submaps, we introduce a distillation-based overlap alignment strategy, in which preceding submaps supervise subsequent ones to ensure consistency in overlapping regions. To further enhance robustness and sampling efficiency, we incorporate a dynamic removal module.

Existing approaches exhibit severe limitations in this setting -- planning methods demand hand-crafted action models, and standard reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are designed for either discrete or continuous actions but not both, and the few RL methods that handle parameterized actions typically rely on domain-specific engineering and fail to exploit the latent structure of these spaces. This paper extends the scope of RL algorithms to long-horizon, sparse-reward settings with parameterized actions by enabling agents to autonomously learn both state and action abstractions online. We introduce algorithms that progressively refine these abstractions during learning, increasing fine-grained detail in the critical regions of the state-action space where greater resolution improves performance. Across several continuous-state, parameterized-action domains, our abstraction-driven approach enables TD($\u03bb$) to achieve markedly higher sample efficiency than state-of-the-art baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u62bd\u8c61\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u957f\u671f\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfTD(\u03bb)\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff1a\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u624b\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfRL\u7b97\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u9762\u5411\u79bb\u6563\u52a8\u4f5c\u8981\u4e48\u9762\u5411\u8fde\u7eed\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u4e24\u8005\u3002\u5df2\u6709\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u7c7b\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7ebf\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b66\u4e60\u72b6\u6001\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u62bd\u8c61\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9010\u6b65\u7cbe\u70bc\u8fd9\u4e9b\u62bd\u8c61\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u952e\u533a\u57df\u589e\u52a0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ec6\u8282\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8fde\u7eed\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7fTD(\u03bb)\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u4e86\u957f\u671f\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u52a8\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u8868\u793a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u5b66\u4e60\u3002"}}

Despite the recent strides in diffusion-based methods for enhancing the representation of tailed lesions, the paucity of rare lesion exemplars curtails the generative capabilities of these approaches, thereby leaving the diagnostic precision less than optimal. In this paper, we propose a novel data synthesis pipeline designed to augment tail lesions utilizing a copious supply of conventional normal X-rays. Specifically, a sufficient quantity of normal samples is amassed to train a diffusion model capable of generating normal X-ray images. This pre-trained diffusion model is subsequently utilized to inpaint the head lesions present in the diseased X-rays, thereby preserving the tail classes as augmented training data. Additionally, we propose the integration of a Large Language Model Knowledge Guidance (LKG) module alongside a Progressive Incremental Learning (PIL) strategy to stabilize the inpainting fine-tuning process.

Yet, the conditions under which RLVR yields robust generalization remain poorly understood. This paper provides an empirical study of RLVR generalization in the setting of probabilistic inference over causal graphical models. This setting offers two natural axes along which to examine generalization: (i) the level of the probabilistic query -- associational, interventional, or counterfactual -- and (ii) the structural complexity of the query, measured by the size of its relevant subgraph. We construct datasets of causal graphs and queries spanning these difficulty axes and fine-tune Qwen-2.5-Instruct models using RLVR or supervised fine-tuning (SFT). We vary both the model scale (3B-32B) and the query level included in training. We find that RLVR yields stronger within-level and across-level generalization than SFT, but only for specific combinations of model size and training query level. Further analysis shows that RLVR's effectiveness depends on the model's initial reasoning competence. With sufficient initial competence, RLVR improves an LLM's marginalization strategy and reduces errors in intermediate probability calculations, producing substantial accuracy gains, particularly on more complex queries. These findings show that RLVR can improve specific causal reasoning subskills, with its benefits emerging only when the model has sufficient initial competence.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce TS-Arena, a platform that restores the operational integrity of forecasting by treating the genuinely unknown future as the definitive test environment. By implementing a pre-registration mechanism on live data streams, the platform ensures that evaluation targets remain physically non-existent during inference, thereby enforcing a strict global temporal split.

This isolation leads to redundant reasoning and stagnates collective intelligence. Current self-reflection frameworks remain largely heuristic and private, lacking a probabilistic foundation to quantify certainty or justify external interaction.To bridge this gap, we propose a formal probabilistic framework that provides agents with a non-altruistic motive for bidirectional knowledge exchange. We model an agent's belief in a proposition using a Beta-Bernoulli distribution with a forgetting factor ($\u03b3$). This allows us to isolate epistemic uncertainty as the variance of belief, establishing a dual drive for interaction: A homeostatic motive: The need to maintain certainty against the temporal decay introduced by $\u03b3$. An optimal learning strategy: Targeting points of maximum ambiguity ($\\mathbb{E}[\u03b8]=0.5$) to maximize information gain. Under this framework, public contribution is reframed as optimal active learning: sharing solutions to elicit feedback is the most efficient method for an agent to reduce its own uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce epistemic caching, which leverages the forgetting factor to dynamically prioritize resources for the active head of non-stationary knowledge distributions. Finally, we demonstrate how these accumulated belief states serve as verifiable reward signals for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and high-quality data filters for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT).

When applied to multi-view images, existing single-view approaches often ignore cross-view relationships, leading to inconsistent results. In contrast, multi-view optimization methods rely on slow differentiable rendering and per-scene refinement, making them computationally expensive and hard to scale. To address these limitations, we introduce a feed-forward multi-view inverse rendering framework that directly predicts spatially varying albedo, metallic, roughness, diffuse shading, and surface normals from sequences of RGB images. By alternating attention across views, our model captures both intra-view long-range lighting interactions and inter-view material consistency, enabling coherent scene-level reasoning within a single forward pass. Due to the scarcity of real-world training data, models trained on existing synthetic datasets often struggle to generalize to real-world scenes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a consistency-based finetuning strategy that leverages unlabeled real-world videos to enhance both multi-view coherence and robustness under in-the-wild conditions. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of multi-view consistency, material and normal estimation quality, and generalization to real-world imagery.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u524d\u9988\u5f0f\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u9006\u6e32\u67d3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u4ea4\u66ff\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u76f4\u63a5\u4eceRGB\u56fe\u50cf\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u573a\u666f\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u5347\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u89c6\u89d2\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u5173\u7cfb\u5bfc\u81f4\u7ed3\u679c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u800c\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7f13\u6162\u7684\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6e32\u67d3\u548c\u9010\u573a\u666f\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u573a\u666f\u3002", "method": "1) \u524d\u9988\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u9006\u6e32\u67d3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8de8\u89c6\u56fe\u4ea4\u66ff\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u83b7\u89c6\u56fe\u5185\u957f\u8ddd\u79bb\u5149\u7167\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u89c6\u56fe\u95f4\u6750\u8d28\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\n2) \u57fa\u4e8e\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u672a\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u89c6\u9891\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u91ce\u5916\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u6750\u8d28\u548c\u6cd5\u7ebf\u4f30\u8ba1\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u4ee5\u53ca\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u524d\u9988\u67b6\u6784\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u9006\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5fae\u8c03\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u573a\u666f\u7406\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Our work is the first to study this particular subgroup problem, for which we make several contributions.\n  Subgroup discovery methods generally require a \"quality function\" in order to sift through and select the most advantageous subgroups. We first examine why existing natural choices for quality functions are insufficient to solve the subgroup discovery problem for the Cox model. To address the shortcomings of existing metrics, we introduce two technical innovations: the *expected prediction entropy (EPE)*, a novel metric for evaluating survival models which predict a hazard function; and the *conditional rank statistics (CRS)*, a statistical object which quantifies the deviation of an individual point to the distribution of survival times in an existing subgroup. We study the EPE and CRS theoretically and show that they can solve many of the problems with existing metrics.\n  We introduce a total of eight algorithms for the Cox subgroup discovery problem. The main algorithm is able to take advantage of both the EPE and the CRS, allowing us to give theoretical correctness results for this algorithm in a well-specified setting. We evaluate all of the proposed methods empirically on both synthetic and real data. The experiments confirm our theory, showing that our contributions allow for the recovery of a ground-truth subgroup in well-specified cases, as well as leading to better model fit compared to naively fitting the Cox model to the whole dataset in practical settings. Lastly, we conduct a case study on jet engine simulation data from NASA. The discovered subgroups uncover known nonlinearities/homogeneity in the data, and which suggest design choices which have been mirrored in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The paper suggests a single architecture model comprising of LangChain-based multi-agent system with a permissioned blockchain to guarantee constant monitoring, policy enforcement, and immutable auditability of agentic action. The framework relates the perception conceptualization-action cycle to a blockchain layer of governance that verifies the inputs, evaluates recommended actions, and documents the outcomes of the execution. A Hyperledger Fabric-based system, action executors MCP-integrated, and LangChain agent are introduced and experiments of smart inventory management, traffic-signal control, and healthcare monitoring are done. The results suggest that blockchain-security verification is efficient in preventing unauthorized practices, offers traceability throughout the whole decision-making process, and maintains operational latency within reasonable ranges.

While autoregressive (AR) generative models like GPT have revolutionized NLP, most visual generative pretraining methods still rely on BERT-style masked modeling, which often disregards the temporal information essential for video analysis. The few existing autoregressive visual pretraining methods suffer from issues such as inaccurate semantic localization and poor generation quality, leading to poor semantics. In this work, we propose NExT-Vid, a novel autoregressive visual generative pretraining framework that utilizes masked next-frame prediction to jointly model images and videos. NExT-Vid introduces a context-isolated autoregressive predictor to decouple semantic representation from target decoding, and a conditioned flow-matching decoder to enhance generation quality and diversity. Through context-isolated flow-matching pretraining, our approach achieves strong representations. Extensive experiments on large-scale pretrained models demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms previous generative pretraining methods for visual representation learning via attentive probing in downstream classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper introduces a price aware agentic AI system, which combines personal finance management with diet optimization. With household income and fixed expenditures, medical and well-being status, as well as real-time food costs, the system creates nutritionally sufficient meals plans at comparatively reasonable prices that automatically adjust to market changes. The framework is implemented in a modular multi-agent architecture, which has specific agents (budgeting, nutrition, price monitoring, and health personalization). These agents share the knowledge base and use the substitution graph to ensure that the nutritional quality is maintained at a minimum cost. Simulations with a representative Saudi household case study show a steady 12-18\\% reduction in costs relative to a static weekly menu, nutrient adequacy of over 95\\% and high performance with price changes of 20-30%. The findings indicate that the framework can locally combine affordability with nutritional adequacy and provide a viable avenue of capacity-building towards sustainable and fair diet planning in line with Sustainable Development Goals on Zero Hunger and Good Health.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Data augmentation, particularly mask-based information dropping, can enhance robustness by forcing models to explore complementary cues; however, existing approaches often lack structural awareness and may discard essential semantics. We propose Granular-ball Guided Masking (GBGM), a structure-aware augmentation strategy guided by Granular-ball Computing (GBC). GBGM adaptively preserves semantically rich, structurally important regions while suppressing redundant areas through a coarse-to-fine hierarchical masking process, producing augmentations that are both representative and discriminative. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in classification accuracy and masked image reconstruction, confirming the effectiveness and broad applicability of the proposed method. Simple and model-agnostic, it integrates seamlessly into CNNs and Vision Transformers and provides a new paradigm for structure-aware data augmentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, extending this success to video editing remains challenging. Recent video editing efforts have adapted pretrained text-to-image models by adding temporal attention mechanisms to handle video tasks. Unfortunately, these methods continue to suffer from temporal inconsistency issues and high computational overheads. In this study, we propose FluencyVE, which is a simple yet effective one-shot video editing approach. FluencyVE integrates the linear time-series module, Mamba, into a video editing model based on pretrained Stable Diffusion models, replacing the temporal attention layer. This enables global frame-level attention while reducing the computational costs. In addition, we employ low-rank approximation matrices to replace the query and key weight matrices in the causal attention, and use a weighted averaging technique during training to update the attention scores. This approach significantly preserves the generative power of the text-to-image model while effectively reducing the computational burden.

This research bridges the gap between mechanistic physics and data driven learning by establishing a novel dual specialist ensemble framework that disentangles vulnerability into two distinct vectors, environmental contagion and structural fragility. The architecture integrates two specialized predictive streams, an environmental specialist, implemented as a graph neural network (GNN) that operationalizes the community as a directed contagion graph weighted by physics informed convection, radiation, and ember probabilities, and enriched with high dimensional Google AlphaEarth Foundation embeddings, and a Structural Specialist, implemented via XGBoost to isolate granular asset level resilience. Applied to the 2025 Eaton Fire, the framework reveals a critical dichotomy in risk drivers. The GNN demonstrates that neighborhood scale environmental pressure overwhelmingly dominates intrinsic structural features in defining propagation pathways, while the XGBoost model identifies eaves as the primary micro scale ingress vector. By synthesizing these divergent signals through logistic stacking, the ensemble achieves robust classification and generates a diagnostic risk topology. This capability empowers decision makers to move beyond binary loss prediction and precisely target mitigation prioritizing vegetation management for high connectivity clusters and structural hardening for architecturally vulnerable nodes thereby operationalizing a proactive, data driven approach to community resilience.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as promising tools for translating technical explanations into accessible narratives, yet the integration of agentic AI, where LLMs operate as autonomous agents through iterative refinement, with XAI remains unexplored. This study proposes an agentic XAI framework combining SHAP-based explainability with multimodal LLM-driven iterative refinement to generate progressively enhanced explanations. As a use case, we tested this framework as an agricultural recommendation system using rice yield data from 26 fields in Japan. The Agentic XAI initially provided a SHAP result and explored how to improve the explanation through additional analysis iteratively across 11 refinement rounds (Rounds 0-10). Explanations were evaluated by human experts (crop scientists) (n=12) and LLMs (n=14) against seven metrics: Specificity, Clarity, Conciseness, Practicality, Contextual Relevance, Cost Consideration, and Crop Science Credibility. Both evaluator groups confirmed that the framework successfully enhanced recommendation quality with an average score increase of 30-33% from Round 0, peaking at Rounds 3-4. However, excessive refinement showed a substantial drop in recommendation quality, indicating a bias-variance trade-off where early rounds lacked explanation depth (bias) while excessive iteration introduced verbosity and ungrounded abstraction (variance), as revealed by metric-specific analysis. These findings suggest that strategic early stopping (regularization) is needed for optimizing practical utility, challenging assumptions about monotonic improvement and providing evidence-based design principles for agentic XAI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408SHAP\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u7684Agentic XAI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6c34\u7a3b\u4ea7\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u7684\u519c\u4e1a\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u9002\u5ea6\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf30-33%\uff0c\u4f46\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u9700\u8981\u6218\u7565\u6027\u7684\u65e9\u505c\u673a\u5236\u6765\u5e73\u8861\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0e\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136XAI\u80fd\u591f\u5e2e\u52a9\u7406\u89e3\u56e0\u7d20\u4e0e\u54cd\u5e94\u53d8\u91cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u4f46\u5411\u975e\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u58eb\u4f20\u8fbe\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u672f\u89e3\u91ca\u4ecd\u7136\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u4e86\u4ed6\u4eec\u5bf9AI\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u4fe1\u4efb\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5c06\u5177\u5907\u81ea\u4e3b\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684Agentic AI\u4e0eXAI\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408SHAP\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc711\u8f6e\u8fed\u4ee3\uff08Rounds 0-10\uff09\u5bf9\u519c\u4e1a\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u8fdb\u884c\u9010\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e13\u5bb6\uff0812\u540d\u4f5c\u7269\u79d1\u5b66\u5bb6\uff09\u548cLLM\uff0814\u4e2a\uff09\u8bc4\u4f30\u89e3\u91ca\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u5305\u62ec\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u3001\u6e05\u6670\u5ea6\u3001\u7b80\u6d01\u6027\u3001\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7b49\u4e03\u4e2a\u65b9\u9762\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u63a8\u8350\u8d28\u91cf\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u534730-33%\uff08\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e8eRound 0\uff09\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u6548\u679c\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u7b2c3-4\u8f6e\u8fed\u4ee3\u3002\u4f46\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u8350\u8d28\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u65e9\u671f\u8fed\u4ee3\u7f3a\u4e4f\u89e3\u91ca\u6df1\u5ea6\uff08\u504f\u5dee\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u8fc7\u5ea6\u8fed\u4ee3\u5219\u5e26\u6765\u5197\u957f\u548c\u672a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u62bd\u8c61\u5316\uff08\u65b9\u5dee\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6218\u7565\u6027\u65e9\u505c\u673a\u5236\uff08\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff09\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316Agentic XAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u7528\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u5355\u8c03\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3aAgentic XAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7684\u539f\u5219\u3002"}}

This capability raises significant privacy concerns regarding malicious misuse of personal portraits. However, no efficient defense framework exists to protect such videos against 3D-field TFG methods. While image-based defenses could apply per-frame 2D perturbations, they incur prohibitive computational costs, severe video quality degradation, failing to disrupt 3D information for video protection. To address this, we propose a novel and efficient video defense framework against 3D-field TFG methods, which protects portrait video by perturbing the 3D information acquisition process while maintain high-fidelity video quality. Specifically, our method introduces: (1) a similarity-guided parameter sharing mechanism for computational efficiency, and (2) a multi-scale dual-domain attention module to jointly optimize spatial-frequency perturbations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework exhibits strong defense capability and achieves a 47x acceleration over the fastest baseline while maintaining high fidelity. Moreover, it remains robust against scaling operations and state-of-the-art purification attacks, and the effectiveness of our design choices is further validated through ablation studies.

The core idea of \\texttt{FedMPDD} is to encode each client's high-dimensional gradient by computing its directional derivatives along multiple random vectors. This compresses the gradient into a much smaller message, significantly reducing uplink communication costs from $\\mathcal{O}(d)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(m)$, where $m \\ll d$. The server then decodes the aggregated information by projecting it back onto the same random vectors. Our key insight is that averaging multiple projections overcomes the dimension-dependent convergence limitations of a single projection. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, establishing that \\texttt{FedMPDD} converges at a rate of $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{K})$, matching the performance of FedSGD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method provides some inherent privacy against gradient inversion attacks due to the geometric properties of low-rank projections, offering a tunable privacy-utility trade-off controlled by the number of projections.

LLM-based persona simulation offers a cheap synthetic alternative, yet it is unclear whether replacing humans with personas preserves the benchmark interface that adaptive methods optimize against. We prove an if-and-only-if characterization: when (i) methods observe only the aggregate outcome (aggregate-only observation) and (ii) evaluation depends only on the submitted artifact and not on the algorithm's identity or provenance (algorithm-blind evaluation), swapping humans for personas is just panel change from the method's point of view, indistinguishable from changing the evaluation population (e.g., New York to Jakarta). Furthermore, we move from validity to usefulness: we define an information-theoretic discriminability of the induced aggregate channel and show that making persona benchmarking as decision-relevant as a field experiment is fundamentally a sample-size question, yielding explicit bounds on the number of independent persona evaluations required to reliably distinguish meaningfully different methods at a chosen resolution.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\uff1a\u5728\u805a\u5408\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f2\u8bc4\u4f30\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u7528LLM\u6a21\u62df\u4eba\u7c7b\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7b49\u540c\u4e8e\u66f4\u6362\u8bc4\u4f30\u4eba\u7fa4\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u6027\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u4f7f\u6a21\u62df\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u540c\u7b49\u6709\u6548\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfA/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5927\uff0c\u4e25\u91cd\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fed\u4ee3\u5f00\u53d1\u3002\u867d\u7136LLM\u6a21\u62df\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5ec9\u4ef7\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u8fd9\u79cd\u6a21\u62df\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u63a5\u53e3\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86if-and-only-if\u7279\u6027\uff1a\u5f53(1)\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u89c2\u6d4b\u805a\u5408\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c(2)\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ec5\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u63d0\u4ea4\u7684\u4ea7\u7269\u800c\u975e\u7b97\u6cd5\u8eab\u4efd\u65f6\uff0c\u7528LLM\u6a21\u62df\u66ff\u4ee3\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u7fa4\u5728\u65b9\u6cd5\u89c6\u89d2\u4e0b\u76f8\u5f53\u4e8e\u53ea\u66f4\u6362\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u9762\u677f\u3002\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u53ef\u533a\u5206\u6027\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u805a\u5408\u4fe1\u9053\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u5bfc\u81f4\u7528LLM\u6a21\u62df\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u76f8\u540c\u51b3\u7b56\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u786e\u7acb\u4e86\u5728\u805a\u5408\u89c2\u6d4b\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f2\u8bc4\u4f30\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cLLM\u6a21\u62df\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4eba\u7fa4\u66f4\u6362\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u7684\u7b49\u4ef7\u6027\u3002\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u660e\u786e\u7684\u6837\u672c\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u786e\u5b9a\u9700\u8981\u591a\u5c11\u72ec\u7acb\u7684LLM\u6a21\u62df\u8bc4\u4f30\u624d\u80fd\u5728\u7ed9\u5b9a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u533a\u5206\u4e0d\u540c\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u6a21\u62df\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3aA/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7684\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\uff0c\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53d6\u51b3\u4e8e\u89c2\u6d4b\u65b9\u5f0f\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6761\u4ef6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u6240\u9700\u6837\u672c\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u62df\u57fa\u51c6\u80fd\u591f\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5b9e\u5730\u5b9e\u9a8c\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6c34\u5e73\u3002"}}

However, most facial recognition models are trained on visible light datasets, leading to substantial performance degradation on infrared inputs due to significant domain shifts. Early feature-based methods for infrared face recognition proved ineffective, prompting researchers to adopt generative approaches that convert infrared images into visible light images for improved recognition. This paradigm, known as Heterogeneous Face Recognition (HFR), faces challenges such as model and modality discrepancies, leading to distortion and feature loss in generated images. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a novel latent diffusion-based model designed to generate high-quality visible face images from thermal inputs while preserving critical identity features. A multi-attribute classifier is incorporated to extract key facial attributes from visible images, mitigating feature loss during infrared-to-visible image restoration. Additionally, we propose the Self-attn Mamba module, which enhances global modeling of cross-modal features and significantly improves inference speed. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both image quality and identity preservation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While traditional low-rank (LR) methods often incur sharp accuracy drops, BLR approaches such as Monarch and BLAST can better capture the underlying structure, thus preserving accuracy while reducing computations and memory footprints. In this work, we use roofline analysis to show that, although BLR methods achieve theoretical savings and practical speedups for single-token inference, multi-token inference often becomes memory-bound in practice, increasing latency despite compiler-level optimizations in PyTorch. To address this, we introduce custom Triton kernels with partial fusion and memory layout optimizations for both Monarch and BLAST.

Failure analysis reveals that, in this setting, the dominant failure mechanism is contextual reasoning rather than missing medication knowledge, with five primary patterns: overconfidence in uncertainty, applying standard guidelines without adjusting for patient context, misunderstanding how healthcare is delivered in practice, factual errors, and process blindness. These patterns persisted across patient complexity and demographic strata, and across a range of state-of-the-art models and configurations. We provide 45 detailed vignettes that comprehensively cover all identified failure cases. This work highlights shortcomings that must be addressed before LLM-based clinical AI can be safely deployed. It also begs larger-scale, prospective evaluations and deeper study of LLM behaviours in clinical contexts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9NHS\u521d\u7ea7\u4fdd\u5065\u6570\u636e\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u53d1\u73b0\u5c3d\u7ba1LLM\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u4e34\u5e8a\u95ee\u9898\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff08\u7075\u654f\u5ea6100%\uff0c\u7279\u5f02\u602783.1%\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7efc\u5408\u8bc6\u522b\u6240\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u65b9\u6848\u65b9\u9762\u4ec5\u8fbe46.9%\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u5931\u8d25\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u800c\u975e\u836f\u7269\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f3a\u5931\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u7597\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5e38\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4f46\u5f88\u5c11\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e34\u5e8a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u6216\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u8d85\u51fa\u5934\u6761\u6307\u6807\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u7528\u836f\u5b89\u5168\u5ba1\u67e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u771f\u5b9eNHS\u521d\u7ea7\u4fdd\u5065\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u8be6\u7ec6\u5206\u6790\u5176\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u590d\u6742\u6027\u4e0d\u540c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5931\u8d25\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u56de\u987e\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6db5\u76d6NHS\u67f4\u90e1\u548c\u9ed8\u897f\u585e\u5fb7\u90e12,125,549\u540d\u6210\u4eba\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u6218\u7565\u6027\u5730\u62bd\u6837\u60a3\u8005\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u7528\u836f\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u7ecf\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u8d28\u91cf\u6392\u9664\u540e\u83b7\u5f97277\u540d\u60a3\u8005\u3002\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e34\u5e8a\u533b\u751f\u5ba1\u67e5\u8fd9\u4e9b\u60a3\u8005\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7ea7\u3002\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e3b\u8981LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5931\u8d25\u5206\u6790\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3b\u8981\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u4e3b\u8981LLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u4e34\u5e8a\u95ee\u9898\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u5f3a\u52b2\uff08\u7075\u654f\u5ea6100% [95% CI 98.2\u2013100]\uff0c\u7279\u5f02\u602783.1% [95% CI 72.7\u201390.1]\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u80fd\u6b63\u786e\u8bc6\u522b46.9% [95% CI 41.1\u201352.8]\u60a3\u8005\u7684\u6240\u6709\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u3002\u5931\u8d25\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e3b\u8981\u5931\u8d25\u673a\u5236\u662f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e94\u5927\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8fc7\u5ea6\u81ea\u4fe1\u3001\u672a\u6839\u636e\u60a3\u8005\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8c03\u6574\u6307\u5357\u5e94\u7528\u3001\u8bef\u89e3\u5b9e\u9645\u533b\u7597\u64cd\u4f5c\u3001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u9519\u8bef\u548c\u6d41\u7a0b\u76f2\u76ee\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u6240\u6709\u60a3\u8005\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u4eba\u53e3\u7edf\u8ba1\u5206\u5c42\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u914d\u7f6e\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u7a81\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u4e34\u5e8aAI\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u524d\u5fc5\u987b\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u8fdb\u884c\u66f4\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u524d\u77bb\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u7814\u7a76LLM\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e8645\u4e2a\u8be6\u7ec6\u6848\u4f8b\uff0c\u5168\u9762\u8986\u76d6\u6240\u6709\u5df2\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u60c5\u51b5\u3002"}}

To improve hologram quality at large depth ranges, we introduce amplitude projection, a post-processing technique that replaces amplitude components of hologram wavefields at each depth layer while preserving phase. This approach enhances reconstruction fidelity, achieving 27.01 dB PSNR and 0.87 SSIM, surpassing a recent optimized silhouette-masking layer-based method by 2.03 dB and 0.04 SSIM, respectively.

Runtime safety guardrails, which intercept hazardous actions during task execution, offer a promising solution due to their flexibility. However, existing defenses often rely on static rule filters or prompt-level control, which struggle to address implicit risks arising in dynamic, temporally dependent, and context-rich environments. To address this, we propose RoboSafe, a hybrid reasoning runtime safeguard for embodied agents through executable predicate-based safety logic. RoboSafe integrates two complementary reasoning processes on a Hybrid Long-Short Safety Memory. We first propose a Backward Reflective Reasoning module that continuously revisits recent trajectories in short-term memory to infer temporal safety predicates and proactively triggers replanning when violations are detected. We then propose a Forward Predictive Reasoning module that anticipates upcoming risks by generating context-aware safety predicates from the long-term safety memory and the agent's multimodal observations. Together, these components form an adaptive, verifiable safety logic that is both interpretable and executable as code. Extensive experiments across multiple agents demonstrate that RoboSafe substantially reduces hazardous actions (-36.8% risk occurrence) compared with leading baselines, while maintaining near-original task performance. Real-world evaluations on physical robotic arms further confirm its practicality. Code will be released upon acceptance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address the NP-hard nature of the rank minimization problem, the nuclear norm is commonly used as a convex and computationally tractable surrogate for the rank function. However, this approach often yields suboptimal solutions due to the excessive shrinkage of singular values.

Existing methods employing traditional cameras encounter numerous challenges such as motion blur, sensor noise, partial occlusion, and changing lighting conditions. The emerging bio-inspired sensors, particularly event cameras, possess advantages such as high dynamic range and low latency, which hold the potential to address the aforementioned challenges. In this work, we present an optical flow-guided 6DoF object pose tracking method with an event camera. A 2D-3D hybrid feature extraction strategy is firstly utilized to detect corners and edges from events and object models, which characterizes object motion precisely. Then, we search for the optical flow of corners by maximizing the event-associated probability within a spatio-temporal window, and establish the correlation between corners and edges guided by optical flow. Furthermore, by minimizing the distances between corners and edges, the 6DoF object pose is iteratively optimized to achieve continuous pose tracking. Experimental results of both simulated and real events demonstrate that our methods outperform event-based state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Progress remains hindered by three coupled factors: the scarcity of large, high-quality image-text corpora; the lack of precise, fine-grained semantic control, which forces reliance on non-semantic cues; and terminological heterogeneity, where diverse phrasings for the same diagnostic concept impede reliable text conditioning. We introduce UniPath, a semantics-driven pathology image generation framework that leverages mature diagnostic understanding to enable controllable generation. UniPath implements Multi-Stream Control: a Raw-Text stream; a High-Level Semantics stream that uses learnable queries to a frozen pathology MLLM to distill paraphrase-robust Diagnostic Semantic Tokens and to expand prompts into diagnosis-aware attribute bundles; and a Prototype stream that affords component-level morphological control via a prototype bank. On the data front, we curate a 2.65M image-text corpus and a finely annotated, high-quality 68K subset to alleviate data scarcity. For a comprehensive assessment, we establish a four-tier evaluation hierarchy tailored to pathology. Extensive experiments demonstrate UniPath's SOTA performance, including a Patho-FID of 80.9 (51% better than the second-best) and fine-grained semantic control achieving 98.7% of the real-image.

Using multiple views offers clear advantages, yet this setting remains relatively underexplored and existing methods often struggle to generalize across diverse environments. In this work we introduce UniPR-3D, the first VPR architecture that effectively integrates information from multiple views. UniPR-3D builds on a VGGT backbone capable of encoding multi-view 3D representations, which we adapt by designing feature aggregators and fine-tune for the place recognition task. To construct our descriptor, we jointly leverage the 3D tokens and intermediate 2D tokens produced by VGGT. Based on their distinct characteristics, we design dedicated aggregation modules for 2D and 3D features, allowing our descriptor to capture fine-grained texture cues while also reasoning across viewpoints. To further enhance generalization, we incorporate both single- and multi-frame aggregation schemes, along with a variable-length sequence retrieval strategy. Our experiments show that UniPR-3D sets a new state of the art, outperforming both single- and multi-view baselines and highlighting the effectiveness of geometry-grounded tokens for VPR.

Accurately and efficiently recognizing both is crucial for developing robust and generalizable document parsing systems. Recently, vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved impressive unified recognition of text and formulas. However, they are large-sized and computationally demanding, restricting their usage in many applications. In this paper, we propose UniRec-0.1B, a unified recognition model with only 0.1B parameters. It is capable of performing text and formula recognition at multiple levels, including characters, words, lines, paragraphs, and documents. To implement this task, we first establish UniRec40M, a large-scale dataset comprises 40 million text, formula and their mix samples, enabling the training of a powerful yet lightweight model. Secondly, we identify two challenges when building such a lightweight but unified expert model. They are: structural variability across hierarchies and semantic entanglement between textual and formulaic content. To tackle these, we introduce a hierarchical supervision training that explicitly guides structural comprehension, and a semantic-decoupled tokenizer that separates text and formula representations. Finally, we develop a comprehensive evaluation benchmark covering Chinese and English documents from multiple domains and with multiple levels. Experimental results on this and public benchmarks demonstrate that UniRec-0.1B outperforms both general-purpose VLMs and leading document parsing expert models, while achieving a 2-9$\\times$ speedup, validating its effectiveness and efficiency.

To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness and explore the boundary of existing VLMs, we construct the first large-scale marine VLM dataset and benchmark called MarineEval, with 2,000 image-based question-answering pairs.

The domain requirements are specially integrated into the data construction and further verified by the corresponding marine domain experts. We comprehensively benchmark 17 existing VLMs on our MarineEval and also investigate the limitations of existing models in answering marine research questions. The experimental results reveal that existing VLMs cannot effectively answer the domain-specific questions, and there is still a large room for further performance improvements.

The proposed model can effectively identify correlated segments in such matrices, better than previous approaches for similar problems. Internally, the proposed model utilizes an overlapping technique and uses pre-trained Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, which makes it robust and generalizable. CoSeNet approach also includes a method that optimizes the parameters of the re-scaling layer using a heuristic algorithm and fitness based on a Window Difference-based metric.

Most existing approaches introduce consistency constraints-typically through instance-level or distribution-level loss functions-to directly align the distribution patterns of source and target domains within their respective latent spaces. However, these strategies often fall short: overly strict constraints can amplify the negative effects of the domain gap, leading to distorted or uninformative content, while overly relaxed constraints may fail to leverage the source domain effectively. This limitation primarily stems from the inherent discrepancy in the underlying distribution structures of the source and target domains. The scarcity of target samples further compounds this issue by hindering accurate estimation of the target domain's distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose Equivariant Feature Rotation (EFR), a novel adaptation strategy that aligns source and target domains at two complementary levels within a self-rotated proxy feature space. Specifically, we perform adaptive rotations within a parameterized Lie Group to transform both source and target features into an equivariant proxy space, where alignment is conducted. These learnable rotation matrices serve to bridge the domain gap by preserving intra-domain structural information without distortion, while the alignment optimization facilitates effective knowledge transfer from the source to the target domain. Comprehensive experiments on a variety of commonly used datasets demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the generative performance within the targeted domain.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

And Monte Carlo Simulation ($N=100,000$ iterations) is used to approximate the statistically robust Expected Win Score ($E[S_m]$), which eliminates the noise of random pairing and early-round luck.

For the first time, we explore continuous representations of human motion sequences, featuring the ability to interpolate, inbetween, and even extrapolate any input motion sequences at arbitrary frame rates. To achieve this, we propose a novel parametric activation-induced hierarchical implicit representation framework, referred to as NAME, based on Implicit Neural Representations (INRs). Our method introduces a hierarchical temporal encoding mechanism that extracts features from motion sequences at multiple temporal scales, enabling effective capture of intricate temporal patterns. Additionally, we integrate a custom parametric activation function, powered by Fourier transformations, into the MLP-based decoder to enhance the expressiveness of the continuous representation.

A central obstacle is the lack of a rigorous understanding of feature learning at large depth. While muP characterizes feature-learning dynamics in the infinite-width limit and enables hyperparameter transfer across width, its depth extension (depth-muP) breaks down for residual blocks with more than one internal layer. We derive Neural Feature Dynamics (NFD) for ResNets with single-layer residual blocks, characterizing feature learning via a coupled forward-backward stochastic system in the joint infinite-width and infinite-depth limit. In this regime, NFD identifies when scaling-law trends persist and explains diminishing returns. It also reveals a vanishing mechanism induced by the 1/sqrt(depth) residual scaling under which the gradient-independence assumption (GIA), known to fail during training at finite depth, becomes provably valid again at infinite depth, yielding an analytically tractable regime for end-to-end feature learning. Motivated by this insight, we study two-layer residual blocks and show that the same mechanism causes feature-learning collapse in the first internal layer at large depth, providing a structural explanation for the empirical failure of depth-muP. Based on this diagnosis, we propose a depth-aware learning-rate correction that counteracts the collapse and empirically restores depth-wise hyperparameter transfer, yielding stronger performance in deeper ResNets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To support reliable 3D generation, we develop a comprehensive data processing pipeline that includes a novel watertight processing method and high-quality data filtering. This pipeline improves the geometric quality of publicly available 3D datasets by removing low-quality samples, filling holes, and thickening thin structures, while preserving fine-grained geometric details. To enable fine-grained geometry refinement, we decouple spatial localization from geometric detail synthesis in the diffusion process. We achieve this by performing voxel-based refinement at fixed spatial locations, where voxel queries derived from coarse geometry provide explicit positional anchors encoded via RoPE, allowing the diffusion model to focus on synthesizing local geometric details within a reduced, structured solution space. Our model is trained exclusively on publicly available 3D datasets, achieving strong geometric quality despite limited training resources. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UltraShape 1.0 performs competitively with existing open-source methods in both data processing quality and geometry generation.

A cross-task structural propagation module is introduced to model potential dependencies among nodes, enabling the model to understand complex structural patterns formed by resource contention, link interactions, and changes in service topology. To enhance adaptability to non-stationary behaviors, the framework incorporates a dynamic adjustment mechanism that automatically regulates internal feature flows according to system state changes, ensuring stable predictions in the presence of sudden load shifts, topology drift, and resource jitter. The experimental evaluation compares multiple models across various metrics and verifies the effectiveness of the framework through analyses of hyperparameter sensitivity, environmental sensitivity, and data sensitivity. The results show that the proposed method achieves superior performance on several error metrics and provides more accurate representations of future states under different operating conditions.

To address this, we introduce VisRes Bench, a benchmark designed to study visual reasoning in naturalistic settings without contextual language supervision. Analyzing model behavior across three levels of complexity, we uncover clear limitations in perceptual and relational visual reasoning capacities. VisRes isolates distinct reasoning abilities across its levels. Level 1 probes perceptual completion and global image matching under perturbations such as blur, texture changes, occlusion, and rotation; Level 2 tests rule-based inference over a single attribute (e.g., color, count, orientation); and Level 3 targets compositional reasoning that requires integrating multiple visual attributes. Across more than 19,000 controlled task images, we find that state-of-the-art VLMs perform near random under subtle perceptual perturbations, revealing limited abstraction beyond pattern recognition.

Kevrekidis", "Eleni Chatzi"], "title": "A Mechanistic Analysis of Transformers for Dynamical Systems", "comment": null, "summary": "Transformers are increasingly adopted for modeling and forecasting time-series, yet their internal mechanisms remain poorly understood from a dynamical systems perspective. In contrast to classical autoregressive and state-space models, which benefit from well-established theoretical foundations, Transformer architectures are typically treated as black boxes. This gap becomes particularly relevant as attention-based models are considered for general-purpose or zero-shot forecasting across diverse dynamical regimes. In this work, we do not propose a new forecasting model, but instead investigate the representational capabilities and limitations of single-layer Transformers when applied to dynamical data. Building on a dynamical systems perspective we interpret causal self-attention as a linear, history-dependent recurrence and analyze how it processes temporal information. Through a series of linear and nonlinear case studies, we identify distinct operational regimes. For linear systems, we show that the convexity constraint imposed by softmax attention fundamentally restricts the class of dynamics that can be represented, leading to oversmoothing in oscillatory settings. For nonlinear systems under partial observability, attention instead acts as an adaptive delay-embedding mechanism, enabling effective state reconstruction when sufficient temporal context and latent dimensionality are available. These results help bridge empirical observations with classical dynamical systems theory, providing insight into when and why Transformers succeed or fail as models of dynamical systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5355\u5c42Transformer\u5728\u5efa\u6a21\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u7684\u5185\u5728\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c6\u89d2\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5904\u7406\u7279\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "Transformer\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5efa\u6a21\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5185\u5728\u673a\u5236\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u540c\uff0cTransformer\u901a\u5e38\u88ab\u89c6\u4e3a\u9ed1\u7bb1\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u8003\u8651\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u5c24\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u3002", "method": "\u4ece\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u89d2\u5ea6\u5c06\u56e0\u679c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5386\u53f2\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u9012\u63a8\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790Transformer\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0csoftmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u51f8\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u8868\u793a\u7684\u52a8\u529b\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u632f\u8361\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5e73\u6ed1\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5145\u5f53\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5d4c\u5165\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u8db3\u591f\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u548c\u9690\u7ef4\u5ea6\u65f6\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u72b6\u6001\u91cd\u6784\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5c06Transformer\u7684\u7ecf\u9a8c\u89c2\u5bdf\u4e0e\u7ecf\u5178\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u6df1\u5165\u7406\u89e3\u4e86Transformer\u4f5c\u4e3a\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4ec0\u4e48\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6210\u529f\u6216\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u4e3a\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6865\u6881\u3002"}}

In this work, we propose a lightweight two-stage retrieval pipeline that leverages event-centric entity extraction to incorporate temporal and contextual signals from real-world captions.

Recent methods align the textual description with human motion at the sequence level, neglecting the internal semantic structure of modalities. However, both motion descriptions and motion sequences can be naturally decomposed into smaller and semantically coherent segments, which can serve as atomic alignment units to achieve finer-grained correspondence. Motivated by this, we propose SegMo, a novel Segment-aligned text-conditioned human Motion generation framework to achieve fine-grained text-motion alignment. Our framework consists of three modules: (1) Text Segment Extraction, which decomposes complex textual descriptions into temporally ordered phrases, each representing a simple atomic action; (2) Motion Segment Extraction, which partitions complete motion sequences into corresponding motion segments; and (3) Fine-grained Text-Motion Alignment, which aligns text and motion segments with contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SegMo improves the strong baseline on two widely used datasets, achieving an improved TOP 1 score of 0.553 on the HumanML3D test set. Moreover, thanks to the learned shared embedding space for text and motion segments, SegMo can also be applied to retrieval-style tasks such as motion grounding and motion-to-text retrieval.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we introduce DreaMontage, a comprehensive framework designed for arbitrary frame-guided generation, capable of synthesizing seamless, expressive, and long-duration one-shot videos from diverse user-provided inputs. To achieve this, we address the challenge through three primary dimensions. (i) We integrate a lightweight intermediate-conditioning mechanism into the DiT architecture. By employing an Adaptive Tuning strategy that effectively leverages base training data, we unlock robust arbitrary-frame control capabilities. (ii) To enhance visual fidelity and cinematic expressiveness, we curate a high-quality dataset and implement a Visual Expression SFT stage. In addressing critical issues such as subject motion rationality and transition smoothness, we apply a Tailored DPO scheme, which significantly improves the success rate and usability of the generated content.

The central object is the Learning Stability Profile, which tracks the infinitesimal response of representations, parameters, and update mechanisms to perturbations along the learning trajectory. We prove a Fundamental Analytic Stability Theorem showing that uniform boundedness of these stability signatures is equivalent, up to norm equivalence, to the existence of a Lyapunov-type energy that dissipates along the learning flow. In smooth regimes, the framework yields explicit stability exponents linking spectral norms, activation regularity, step sizes, and learning rates to contractivity of the learning dynamics. Classical spectral stability results for feedforward networks, a discrete CFL-type condition for residual architectures, and parametric and temporal stability laws for stochastic gradient methods arise as direct consequences. The theory extends to non-smooth learning systems, including ReLU networks, proximal and projected updates, and stochastic subgradient flows, by replacing classical derivatives with Clarke generalized derivatives and smooth energies with variational Lyapunov functionals. The resulting framework provides a unified dynamical description of stability across architectures and optimization methods, clarifying how architectural and algorithmic choices jointly govern robustness and sensitivity to perturbations.

Existing single-class or multi-class anomaly detection (AD) models typically rely on fixed modality configurations, require repetitive training, or fail to generalize to unseen modality combinations, limiting their clinical scalability. In this work, we present a unified Any-Modality AD framework that performs robust anomaly detection and localization under arbitrary MRI modality availability. The framework integrates a dual-pathway DINOv2 encoder with a feature distribution alignment mechanism that statistically aligns incomplete-modality features with full-modality representations, enabling stable inference even with severe modality dropout. To further enhance semantic consistency, we introduce an Intrinsic Normal Prototypes (INPs) extractor and an INP-guided decoder that reconstruct only normal anatomical patterns while naturally amplifying abnormal deviations. Through randomized modality masking and indirect feature completion during training, the model learns to adapt to all modality configurations without re-training.

Observing the inefficiencies and bottlenecks of current SoTA image sequence generation methods, we showcase that rather than working with large tensors, we can improve the generation process by factorizing it into first generating the coarse sequence at low resolution and then refining the individual frames at high resolution. We train a generative model solely on grid images comprising subsampled frames. Yet, we learn to generate image sequences, using the strong self-attention mechanism of the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to capture correlations between frames. In effect, our formulation extends a 2D image generator to operate as a low-resolution 3D image-sequence generator without introducing any architectural modifications. Subsequently, we super-resolve each frame individually to add the sequence-independent high-resolution details. This approach offers several advantages and can overcome key limitations of the SoTA in this domain. Compared to existing image sequence generation models, our method achieves superior synthesis quality and improved coherence across sequences. It also delivers high-fidelity generation of arbitrary-length sequences and increased efficiency in inference time and training data usage.

Establishing such theoretical guarantees is non-trivial, as the merging process typically forbids access to the original training data and involves combining fine-tuned models trained on fundamentally heterogeneous data distributions. Without a principled understanding of these dynamics, current methods often rely on heuristics to approximate the optimal combination of parameters. This dependence is most critical in coefficient scaling, the weighting factors that modulate the magnitude of each fine-tuned model's contribution to the shared parameter. However, without a principled objective to guide their selection, these methods lead to brittle performance and are highly sensitive to scaling initialization. We address this gap by (i) establishing a novel flatness-aware PAC-Bayes generalization bound specifically for the model merging setting. This analysis introduces a \"cross-task heterogeneity\" term that formally captures the mismatch between diverse fine-tuned model priors and the target multi-task distributions. Guided by this theoretical insight, (ii) we frame model merging as multi-teacher knowledge distillation on scarce, unlabeled data. We formally demonstrate that minimizing the student-teacher Kullback-Leibler divergence directly tightens the upper bound on the merged model's excess risk.

To address this limitation, we explore the emerging SNN as a promising paradigm for highly efficient surgical intelligence.

Although many methods have been proposed to detect table structures and extract cell contents, accurately identifying table segment boundaries (rows and columns) remains challenging, particularly in low-resolution or noisy images. In many real-world scenarios, table data are incomplete or degraded, limiting the adaptability of transformer-based methods to noisy inputs. Mask-based edge detection techniques have shown greater robustness under such conditions, as their sensitivity can be adjusted through threshold tuning; however, existing approaches typically apply masks directly to images, leading to noise sensitivity, resolution loss, or high computational cost. This paper proposes a novel multi-scale signal-processing method for detecting table edges from table masks. Row and column transitions are modeled as one-dimensional signals and processed using Gaussian convolution with progressively increasing variances, followed by statistical thresholding to suppress noise while preserving stable structural edges. Detected signal peaks are mapped back to image coordinates to obtain accurate segment boundaries. Experimental results show that applying the proposed approach to column edge detection improves Cell-Aware Segmentation Accuracy (CASA) a layout-aware metric evaluating both textual correctness and correct cell placement from 67% to 76% on the PubLayNet-1M benchmark when using TableNet with PyTesseract OCR. The method is robust to resolution variations through zero-padding and scaling strategies and produces optimized structured tabular outputs suitable for downstream analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u8868\u683c\u63a9\u7801\u4e2d\u68c0\u6d4b\u8868\u683c\u8fb9\u7f18\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u65af\u5377\u79ef\u548c\u7edf\u8ba1\u9608\u503c\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u9ad8\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u8fb9\u7f18\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8868\u683c\u7ed3\u6784\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6216\u566a\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u884c\u5217\u8fb9\u754c\u4ecd\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u867d\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u4f46\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u654f\u611f\u3001\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e22\u5931\u6216\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u884c\u5217\u8fc7\u6e21\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e00\u7ef4\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u65b9\u5dee\u9010\u6e10\u589e\u5927\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u5377\u79ef\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u9608\u503c\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\u5e76\u4fdd\u7559\u7a33\u5b9a\u7ed3\u6784\u8fb9\u7f18\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\u5cf0\u503c\u6620\u5c04\u56de\u56fe\u50cf\u5750\u6807\u4ee5\u83b7\u5f97\u51c6\u786e\u5206\u5272\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "result": "\u5728PubLayNet-1M\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5217\u8fb9\u7f18\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5c06Cell-Aware Segmentation Accuracy (CASA)\u4ece67%\u63d0\u5347\u523076%\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5bf9\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8868\u683c\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u4f4e\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8868\u683c\u8fb9\u754c\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

This mismatch leaves no suitable method to solve surface PDEs directly within the neural domain, forcing explicit mesh extraction or per-instance residual training, preventing end-to-end workflows. We present a novel, mesh-free formulation that learns a local update operator conditioned on neural (local) shape attributes, enabling surface PDEs to be solved directly where the (neural) data lives. The operator integrates naturally with prevalent neural surface representations, is trained once on a single representative shape, and generalizes across shape and topology variations, enabling accurate, fast inference without explicit meshing or per-instance optimization while preserving differentiability. Across analytic benchmarks (heat equation and Poisson solve on sphere) and real neural assets across different representations, our method slightly outperforms CPM while remaining reasonably close to FEM, and, to our knowledge, delivers the first end-to-end pipeline that solves surface PDEs on both neural and classical surface representations.

On the Utility of Low-Level Tasks", "comment": null, "summary": "The data processing inequality is an information-theoretic principle stating that the information content of a signal cannot be increased by processing the observations. In particular, it suggests that there is no benefit in enhancing the signal or encoding it before addressing a classification problem. This assertion can be proven to be true for the case of the optimal Bayes classifier. However, in practice, it is common to perform \"low-level\" tasks before \"high-level\" downstream tasks despite the overwhelming capabilities of modern deep neural networks. In this paper, we aim to understand when and why low-level processing can be beneficial for classification. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of a binary classification setup, where we consider a classifier that is tightly connected to the optimal Bayes classifier and converges to it as the number of training samples increases. We prove that for any finite number of training samples, there exists a pre-classification processing that improves the classification accuracy. We also explore the effect of class separation, training set size, and class balance on the relative gain from this procedure. We support our theory with an empirical investigation of the theoretical setup. Finally, we conduct an empirical study where we investigate the effect of denoising and encoding on the performance of practical deep classifiers on benchmark datasets. Specifically, we vary the size and class distribution of the training set, and the noise level, and demonstrate trends that are consistent with our theoretical results.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce TICON, a transformer-based tile representation contextualizer that produces rich, contextualized embeddings for ''any'' application in computational pathology. Standard tile encoder-based pipelines, which extract embeddings of tiles stripped from their context, fail to model the rich slide-level information essential for both local and global tasks. Furthermore, different tile-encoders excel at different downstream tasks. Therefore, a unified model is needed to contextualize embeddings derived from ''any'' tile-level foundation model. TICON addresses this need with a single, shared encoder, pretrained using a masked modeling objective to simultaneously unify and contextualize representations from diverse tile-level pathology foundation models. Our experiments demonstrate that TICON-contextualized embeddings significantly improve performance across many different tasks, establishing new state-of-the-art results on tile-level benchmarks (i.e., HEST-Bench, THUNDER, CATCH) and slide-level benchmarks (i.e., Patho-Bench).

Applying well-established statistical method effectively to LLM evals requires consideration of their unique noise characteristics. We clearly define and measure three types of noise: prediction noise from generating different answers on a given question, data noise from sampling questions, and their combined total noise following the law of total variance. To emphasize relative comparisons and gain statistical power, we propose the all-pairs paired method, which applies the paired analysis to all pairs of LLMs and measures all the noise components based on millions of question-level predictions across many evals and settings. These measurements revealed clear patterns. First, each eval exhibits a characteristic and highly predictable total noise level across all model pairs.

The SAM2 pipelines typically propagate all visual tokens produced by the image encoder through downstream temporal reasoning modules, regardless of their relevance to the target object, resulting in reduced scalability due to quadratic memory attention overhead. In this work, we introduce a text-guided token pruning framework that improves inference efficiency by selectively reducing token density prior to temporal propagation, without modifying the underlying segmentation architecture. Operating after visual encoding and before memory based propagation, our method ranks tokens using a lightweight routing mechanism that integrates local visual context, semantic relevance derived from object-centric textual descriptions (either user-provided or automatically generated), and uncertainty cues that help preserve ambiguous or boundary critical regions. By retaining only the most informative tokens for downstream processing, the proposed approach reduces redundant computation while maintaining segmentation fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple challenging video segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that post-encoder token pruning provides a practical and effective pathway to efficient, prompt-aware video segmentation, achieving up to 42.50 percent faster inference and 37.41 percent lower GPU memory usage compared to the unpruned baseline SAM2, while preserving competitive J and F performance. These results highlight the potential of early token selection to improve the scalability of transformer-based video segmentation systems for real-time and resource-constrained applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
