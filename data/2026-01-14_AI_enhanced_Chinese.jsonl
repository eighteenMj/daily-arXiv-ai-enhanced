The model is an ideal observer for thresholded data inspired by the human visual system, allowing selective processing of high-salience features to improve discrimination performance. By filtering out irrelevant variability, the model enhances diagnostic accuracy and computational efficiency.\n  The observer employs a two-stage framework: candidate selection and decision-making. Using thresholded data during candidate selection refines regions of interest, while stage-specific feature processing optimizes performance. Simulations were conducted to evaluate the effects of thresholding on feature maps, candidate localization, and multi-feature scenarios. Results demonstrate that thresholding improves observer performance by excluding low-salience features, particularly in noisy environments. Intermediate thresholds often outperform no thresholding, indicating that retaining only relevant features is more effective than keeping all features.\n  Additionally, the model demonstrates effective training with fewer images while maintaining alignment with human performance. These findings suggest that the proposed novel framework can predict human visual search performance in clinically realistic tasks and provide solutions for model observer training with limited resources. Our novel approach has applications in other areas where human visual search and detection tasks are modeled such as in computer vision, machine learning, defense and security image analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The major hindrance to treatment lies in the accurate analysis of the medical images. More particularly, aortic segmentation of the 3D image is often tedious and difficult. Deep-learning-based segmentation models are an ideal solution, but their inability to deliver usable outputs in difficult cases and their computational cost cause their clinical adoption to stay limited. This study presents an innovative approach for efficient aortic segmentation using targeted region of interest (ROI) detection. In contrast to classical detection models, we propose a simple and efficient detection model that can be widely applied to detect a single ROI. Our detection model is trained as a multi-task model, using an encoder-decoder architecture for segmentation and a fully connected network attached to the bottleneck for detection. We compare the performance of a one-step segmentation model applied to a complete image, nnU-Net and our cascade model composed of a detection and a segmentation step. We achieve a mean Dice similarity coefficient of 0.944 with over 0.9 for all cases using a third of the computing power. This simple solution achieves state-of-the-art performance while being compact and robust, making it an ideal solution for clinical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We focus on the basic case of two strands in a single row and analyze the expected completion time under this row-constrained model. By decomposing the process into a Markov chain, we derive analytical upper and lower bounds on the expected synthesis time. We show that a simple laggard-first policy achieves an asymptotic expected completion time of (q+3)L/2 for any alphabet of size q, and that no online policy without look-ahead can asymptotically outperform this bound. For the binary case, we show that allowing a single-symbol look-ahead strictly improves performance, yielding an asymptotic expected completion time of 7L/3.

Current scheduling exhibits two drawbacks: a granularity mismatch between coarse, task-level decisions and fine-grained, packet-level channel dynamics, and insufficient awareness of per-task complexity. Consequently, scheduling solely at the task level leads to inefficient resource utilization. This paper proposes a novel ENergy-ACcuracy Hierarchical optimization framework for split Inference, named ENACHI, that jointly optimizes task- and packet-level scheduling to maximize accuracy under energy and delay constraints. A two-tier Lyapunov-based framework is developed for ENACHI, with a progressive transmission technique further integrated to enhance adaptivity. At the task level, an outer drift-plus-penalty loop makes online decisions for DNN partitioning and bandwidth allocation, and establishes a reference power budget to manage the long-term energy-accuracy trade-off. At the packet level, an uncertainty-aware progressive transmission mechanism is employed to adaptively manage per-sample task complexity. This is integrated with a nested inner control loop implementing a novel reference-tracking policy, which dynamically adjusts per-slot transmit power to adapt to fluctuating channel conditions. Experiments on ImageNet dataset demonstrate that ENACHI outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks under varying deadlines and bandwidths, achieving a 43.12\\% gain in inference accuracy with a 62.13\\% reduction in energy consumption under stringent deadlines, and exhibits high scalability by maintaining stable energy consumption in congested multi-user scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In the medical domain, where diagnostic decisions depend on nuanced visual cues and sequential reasoning, CoT aligns naturally with clinical thinking processes. However, Current benchmarks for medical image understanding generally focus on the final answer while ignoring the reasoning path. An opaque process lacks reliable bases for judgment, making it difficult to assist doctors in diagnosis. To address this gap, we introduce a new M3CoTBench benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the correctness, efficiency, impact, and consistency of CoT reasoning in medical image understanding. M3CoTBench features 1) a diverse, multi-level difficulty dataset covering 24 examination types, 2) 13 varying-difficulty tasks, 3) a suite of CoT-specific evaluation metrics (correctness, efficiency, impact, and consistency) tailored to clinical reasoning, and 4) a performance analysis of multiple MLLMs. M3CoTBench systematically evaluates CoT reasoning across diverse medical imaging tasks, revealing current limitations of MLLMs in generating reliable and clinically interpretable reasoning, and aims to foster the development of transparent, trustworthy, and diagnostically accurate AI systems for healthcare.

We identify a dichotomy in the Stein-exponent of all these setups depending on the structure of the DMC's transition law. Under any of these three constraints, when the DMC is partially-connected (i.e., some outputs cannot be induced by certain inputs) the Stein-exponent matches the exponent identified by Han and Kobayashi and by Shalaby and Papamarcou for the scenario where communication is of zero-rate but over a noiseless link. We prove our result by adapting Han's zero-rate coding strategy to partially-connected DMCs.\n  In contrast, for fully-connected DMCs, in our scenarios 1) and 2) the Stein-exponent collapses to that of a local test at the decision center, rendering the remote sensor and communication useless. %To prove this result, we propose new converse proofs relying on change of measure arguments.\n  In scenario 3), the sensor remains beneficial even for fully-connected DMCs, however also collapses compared to the case of a partially-connected DMC. Moreover, the Stein-exponent is larger when the expectation constraint is imposed only under the null hypothesis compared to when it is imposed under both hypotheses. To prove these results, we propose both new coding strategies and new converse proofs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Code can be found at: https://github.com/glam-imperial/AffectEffect", "summary": "Generalisation to unseen subjects in EEG-based emotion classification remains a challenge due to high inter-and intra-subject variability. Continual learning (CL) poses a promising solution by learning from a sequence of tasks while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Regularisation-based CL approaches, such as Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), Synaptic Intelligence (SI), and Memory Aware Synapses (MAS), are commonly used as baselines in EEG-based CL studies, yet their suitability for this problem remains underexplored. This study theoretically and empirically finds that regularisation-based CL methods show limited performance for EEG-based emotion classification on the DREAMER and SEED datasets. We identify a fundamental misalignment in the stability-plasticity trade-off, where regularisation-based methods prioritise mitigating catastrophic forgetting (backward transfer) over adapting to new subjects (forward transfer). We investigate this limitation under subject-incremental sequences and observe that: (1) the heuristics for estimating parameter importance become less reliable under noisy data and covariate shift, (2) gradients on parameters deemed important by these heuristics often interfere with gradient updates required for new subjects, moving optimisation away from the minimum, (3) importance values accumulated across tasks over-constrain the model, and (4) performance is sensitive to subject order. Forward transfer showed no statistically significant improvement over sequential fine-tuning (p > 0.05 across approaches and datasets). The high variability of EEG signals means past subjects provide limited value to future subjects. Regularisation-based continual learning approaches are therefore limited for robust generalisation to unseen subjects in EEG-based emotion classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The system features a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) terrestrial base station (BS) and explores both monostatic and bistatic radar configurations to enable joint communication and sensing. In the monostatic configuration, both the transmitter and receiver are at the same location, while the bistatic configuration separates the transmitter and receiver spatially. System performance is evaluated using Fisher Information (FI) to quantify sensing accuracy and Mutual Information (MI) to measure communication efficiency. To achieve an optimal balance between communication and sensing, the RIS reflective coefficients and BS transmit beamforming are jointly optimized by maximizing a weighted sum of FI and MI. A novel solution approach is proposed for a single-user, single-object scenario, leveraging the mutual coupling model to enhance system realism. The impact of self-interference on sensing performance is also investigated through signal quantization. Numerical results reveal a fundamental trade-off between FI and MI and demonstrate that incorporating mutual coupling within a physically-consistent framework significantly improves both communication and sensing performance compared to conventional RIS-assisted JCAS models. Additionally, the analysis highlights how the choice of monostatic versus bistatic radar configuration affects system performance, offering valuable insights for the design of RIS-assisted JCAS systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5728\u8003\u8651RIS\u5143\u4ef6\u4e92\u8026\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86RIS\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u8054\u5408\u901a\u4fe1\u611f\u77e5\u4e0b\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u901a\u8fc7Fisher\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\u5206\u522b\u91cf\u5316\u611f\u77e5\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0e\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316RIS\u53cd\u5c04\u7cfb\u6570\u548c\u57fa\u7ad9\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u4e92\u8026\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5355/\u53cc\u57fa\u5730\u914d\u7f6e\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684RIS\u8f85\u52a9\u8054\u5408\u901a\u4fe1\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u901a\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565RIS\u5143\u4ef6\u95f4\u7684\u4e92\u8026\u6548\u5e94\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5728\u66f4\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u7269\u7406\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u7814\u7a76RIS\u8f85\u52a9JCAS\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e92\u8026\u5bf9\u5355/\u53cc\u57fa\u5730\u914d\u7f6e\u4e2d\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "1) \u5efa\u7acb\u542b\u4e92\u8026\u6548\u5e94\u7684RIS\u8f85\u52a9MIMO JCAS\u7cfb\u7edf\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528Fisher\u4fe1\u606f(FI)\u8bc4\u4f30\u611f\u77e5\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f(MI)\u8bc4\u4f30\u901a\u4fe1\u6548\u7387\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5927\u5316\u52a0\u6743\u548c(FI + \u03b1 \u00d7 MI)\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316RIS\u53cd\u5c04\u7cfb\u6570\u548cBS\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\uff1b4) \u5206\u6790\u4fe1\u53f7\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u81ea\u5e72\u6270\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b5) \u5bf9\u6bd4\u5355\u57fa\u5730\u4e0e\u53cc\u57fa\u5730\u96f7\u8fbe\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff1a1) FI\u4e0eMI\u5b58\u5728\u6839\u672c\u6027\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b2) \u5728\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u8003\u8651\u4e92\u8026\u6548\u5e94\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edfRIS\u8f85\u52a9JCAS\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\uff1b3) \u96f7\u8fbe\u914d\u7f6e\u9009\u62e9(\u5355/\u53cc\u57fa\u5730)\u5bf9\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b4) \u6240\u63d0\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5355\u7528\u6237\u5355\u76ee\u6807\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8003\u8651RIS\u5143\u4ef6\u4e92\u8026\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9RIS\u8f85\u52a9JCAS\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u80fd\u5b9e\u8d28\u6027\u5730\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5355/\u53cc\u57fa\u5730\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u9700\u8981\u6839\u636e\u5177\u4f53\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u8fdb\u884c\u6743\u8861\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u672a\u6765RIS\u8f85\u52a9JCAS\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

In this study, we investigate the relationship between Gabor-based features and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) based texture features in modeling early-stage visual search behavior. Two feature-combination pipelines are proposed to integrate Gabor and GLCM features for narrowing the region of possible human fixations. The pipelines are evaluated using simulated digital breast tomosynthesis images. Results show qualitative agreement among fixation candidates predicted by the proposed pipelines and a threshold-based model observer. A strong correlation is observed between GLCM mean and Gabor feature responses, indicating that these features encode related image information despite their different formulations. Eye-tracking data from human observers further suggest consistency between predicted fixation regions and early-stage gaze behavior.

Varley"], "title": "The many faces of multivariate information", "comment": null, "summary": "Extracting higher-order structures from multivariate data has become an area of intensive study in complex systems science, as these multipartite interactions can reveal insights into fundamental features of complex systems like emergent phenomena. Information theory provides a natural language for exploring these interactions, as it elegantly formalizes the problem of comparing ``wholes\" and ``parts\" using joint, conditional, and marginal entropies. A large number of distinct statistics have been developed over the years, all aiming to capture different aspects of ``higher-order\" information sharing. Here, we show that three of them (the dual total correlation, S-information, and O-information) are special cases of a more general function, $\u0394^{k}$ which is parameterized by a free parameter $k$. For different values of $k$, we recover different measures: $\u0394^{0}$ is equal to the S-information, $\u0394^{1}$ is equal to the dual total correlation, and $\u0394^{2}$ is equal to the negative O-information. Generally, the $\u0394^{k}$ function is arranged into a hierarchy of increasingly high-order synergies; for a given value of $k$, if $\u0394^{k}>0$, then the system is dominated by interactions with order greater than $k$, while if $\u0394^{k}<0$, then the system is dominated by interactions with order lower than $k$. $\u0394^{k}=0$ if the system is composed entirely of synergies of order-k. Using the entropic conjugation framework, we also find that the conjugate of $\u0394^{k}$, which we term $\u0393^{k}$ is arranged into a similar hierarchy of increasingly high-order redundancies. These results provide new insights into the nature of both higher-order redundant and synergistic interactions, and helps unify the existing zoo of measures into a more coherent structure.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We propose RewriteNets, a novel neural architecture built on an alternative paradigm: explicit, parallel string rewriting. Each layer in a RewriteNet contains a set of learnable rules. For each position in an input sequence, the layer performs four operations: (1) fuzzy matching of rule patterns, (2) conflict resolution via a differentiable assignment operator to select non-overlapping rewrites, (3) application of the chosen rules to replace input segments with output segments of potentially different lengths, and (4) propagation of untouched tokens. While the discrete assignment of rules is non-differentiable, we employ a straight-through Gumbel-Sinkhorn estimator, enabling stable end-to-end training.

In this scenario, a multiple-antenna base station (BS) transmits information to multiple single-antenna communication users while concurrently estimating the parameters of a single sensing object using the echo signal. We present an integrated beamforming approach for JCAS in a multi-user multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) system. The performance measures for communication and sensing are Fisher information (FI) and mutual information (MI). Our research considers two scenarios: multiple communication users with a single sensing object and a single communication user with a single sensing object. We formulate a multi-objective optimization problem to maximize the weighted sum of MI and FI, subject to a total transmit power budget for both cases. As a particular case, we address the equivalent isotropic radiated power (EIRP) for the single communication user scenario. We use the uplink-downlink duality for the multi-user case to simplify the problem and apply Lagrangian optimization and line search methods with a block-coordinate ascending technique. We use projected gradient descent (PGD) to solve the optimization problem in the single-user case. Our numerical results demonstrate that joint beamforming is optimal for the multi-user JCAS system, as opposed to independent beamforming for each user and the sensing object. Furthermore, we reveal the Pareto boundary for the multi-user case, with variations in the number of communication users and the number of transmitting and receiving antennas. We provide the Pareto boundary depending on EIRP limitations for the single-user case.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The first question is how to enable a model to recognize that it does not know. A promising approach is to use confidence, computed from the model's internal signals, to reflect its ignorance. Prior work in specific domains has shown that calibration can provide reliable confidence estimates. In this work, we propose a simple, effective, and universal training-free method that applies to both vision and language models, performing model calibration, cascading, and data cleaning to better exploit a model's ability to recognize when it does not know. We first highlight two key empirical observations: higher confidence corresponds to higher accuracy within a single model, and models calibrated on the validation set remain calibrated on a held-out test set. These findings empirically establish the reliability and comparability of calibrated confidence. Building on this, we introduce two applications: (1) model cascading with calibrated advantage routing and (2) data cleaning based on model ensemble. Using the routing signal derived from the comparability of calibrated confidences, we cascade large and small models to improve efficiency with almost no compromise in accuracy, and we further cascade two models of comparable scale to achieve performance beyond either model alone. Leveraging multiple experts and their calibrated confidences, we design a simple yet effective data-cleaning method that balances precision and detection rate to identify mislabeled samples in ImageNet and Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) datasets. Our results demonstrate that enabling models to recognize when they do not know is a practical step toward more efficient, reliable, and trustworthy AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Vision-language models (VLMs) enable strong zero-shot image classification, but existing VLM-based distracted driver detectors often underperform in real-world conditions. We identify subject-specific appearance variations (e.g., clothing, age, and gender) as a key bottleneck: VLMs entangle these factors with behavior cues, leading to decisions driven by who the driver is rather than what the driver is doing. To address this, we propose a subject decoupling framework that extracts a driver appearance embedding and removes its influence from the image embedding prior to zero-shot classification, thereby emphasizing distraction-relevant evidence.

In this work, we systematically evaluate the impact of explicitly specifying extensive safety codes versus demonstrating them through illustrative cases. We find that referencing explicit codes inconsistently improves harmlessness and systematically degrades helpfulness, whereas training on case-augmented simple codes yields more robust and generalized safety behaviors. By guiding LLMs with case-augmented reasoning instead of extensive code-like safety rules, we avoid rigid adherence to narrowly enumerated rules and enable broader adaptability. Building on these insights, we propose CADA, a case-augmented deliberative alignment method for LLMs utilizing reinforcement learning on self-generated safety reasoning chains.

Looking towards future networks, the extrapolation of this paradigm leads to systems with many hundreds of antennas per base station, raising concerns regarding hardware complexity, cost, and power consumption. This article suggests more intelligent array designs that reduce the need for excessive antenna numbers. We revisit classical uniform array design principles and explain how their uniform spatial sampling leads to unnecessary redundancies in practical deployment scenarios. By exploiting non-uniform sparse arrays with site-specific antenna placements -- based on either pre-optimized irregular arrays or real-time movable antennas -- we demonstrate how superior multiuser MIMO performance can be achieved with far fewer antennas. These principles are inspired by previous works on wireless localization. We explain and demonstrate numerically how these concepts can be adapted for communications to improve the average sum rate and similar metrics. The results suggest a paradigm shift for future antenna array design, where antenna intelligence replaces sheer antenna count. This opens new opportunities for efficient, adaptable, and sustainable Gigantic MIMO systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Extensive amount of computation and cooling required in datacenters increase concerns about the energy use and carbon emissions of AI datacenters. Although current state-of-the-art has examined the energy efficiency of LLM inference, most prior research focused on optimizing compute-side scheduling without considering thermal objectives or constraints. Since GPU-intensive inference generates substantial heat that can degrade datacenter performance, ignoring thermal effects can increase total energy consumption and reduce the efficiency of LLM serving. To fill this gap, we profile the characteristics of GPU servers under varying cooling and AI jobs, and develop a joint cooling and computing modeling approach for AI datacenters. Built upon such workload and thermal dynamics models, a novel hierarchical control framework is proposed to co-optimize computing and thermal management by identifying the optimal GPU parallelism, frequency (DVFS), and cooling control knobs.

The prevailing editing paradigm, which appends an update matrix to the original parameter matrix, has been shown by some studies to damage key numerical stability indicators (such as condition number and norm), thereby reducing editing performance and general abilities, especially in sequential editing scenario. Although subsequent methods have made some improvements, they remain within the additive framework and have not fundamentally addressed this limitation. To solve this problem, we analyze it from both statistical and mathematical perspectives and conclude that multiplying the original matrix by an orthogonal matrix does not change the numerical stability of the matrix. Inspired by this, different from the previous additive editing paradigm, a multiplicative editing paradigm termed Multiplicative Orthogonal Sequential Editing (MOSE) is proposed. Specifically, we first derive the matrix update in the multiplicative form, the new knowledge is then incorporated into an orthogonal matrix, which is multiplied by the original parameter matrix. In this way, the numerical stability of the edited matrix is unchanged, thereby maintaining editing performance and general abilities. We compared MOSE with several current knowledge editing methods, systematically evaluating their impact on both editing performance and the general abilities across three different LLMs. Experimental results show that MOSE effectively limits deviations in the edited parameter matrix and maintains its numerical stability. Compared to current methods, MOSE achieves a 12.08% improvement in sequential editing performance, while retaining 95.73% of general abilities across downstream tasks.

However, high-stakes applications can occur internally when companies deploy highly capable systems within their own organizations, such as for automating R\\&D, accelerating critical business processes, and handling sensitive proprietary data. This paper examines how frontier AI regulations in the United States and European Union in 2025 handle internal deployment. We identify three gaps that could cause internally-deployed systems to evade intended oversight: (1) scope ambiguity that allows internal systems to evade regulatory obligations, (2) point-in-time compliance assessments that fail to capture the continuous evolution of internal systems, and (3) information asymmetries that subvert regulatory awareness and oversight.

Its large-range movement renders wireless channels transmission into the near-field region, which brings new performance enhancement for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC). This paper proposes a novel multi-stage design framework for broadband near-field ISAC assisted by MA. The framework first divides the MA movement area into multiple subregions, and employs the Newtonized orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm (NOMP) to achieve high-precision angle estimation in each subregion. Subsequently, a method called near-field localization via subregion ray clustering (LSRC) is proposed for identifying the positions of scatterers. This method finds the coordinates of each scatterer by jointly processing the angle estimates across all subregions. Finally, according to the estimated locations of the scatterers, the near-field channel estimation (CE) is refined for improving communication performance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can significantly enhance MA sensing accuracy and CE, providing an efficient solution for MA-aided near-field ISAC.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While these algorithmic components are established in evolutionary computing, their tailored integration and specific tuning for control design tasks represent a novel application in this context.

However, current LEO systems still exhibit significant latency variations, limiting their suitability for latency-sensitive services. We present a detailed statistical analysis of end-to-end latency based on 500Hz experimental bidirectional one-way measurements and introduce a segmentation of the deterministic 15-second periodic behavior observed in Starlink. We characterize handover-induced boundary regions that produce latency spikes lasting approximately 140 ms at the beginning and 75 ms at the end of each cycle, followed by a stable intra-period regime, enabling accurate short-term prediction. This analysis shows that latency prediction based on long-term statistics leads to pessimistic estimates. In contrast, by exploiting the periodic structure, isolating boundary regions, and applying lightweight parametric and non-parametric models to intra-period latency distributions, we achieve 99th-percentile latency prediction errors below 50 ms. Furthermore, period-level latency prediction and classification enable adaptive transmission strategies by identifying upcoming periods where application latency requirements cannot be satisfied, necessitating the use of alternative systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This limits instructors' ability to identify disengagement and adapt teaching strategies in real time. This paper presents SCASED (Smart Classroom Attendance System with Emotion Detection), an IoT-based system that integrates automated attendance tracking with facial emotion recognition to support classroom engagement monitoring. The system uses a Raspberry Pi camera and OpenCV for face detection, and a finetuned MobileNetV2 model to classify four learning-related emotional states: engagement, boredom, confusion, and frustration. A session-based mechanism is implemented to manage attendance and emotion monitoring by recording attendance once per session and performing continuous emotion analysis thereafter. Attendance and emotion data are visualized through a cloud-based dashboard to provide instructors with insights into classroom dynamics. Experimental evaluation using the DAiSEE dataset achieved an emotion classification accuracy of 89.5%. The results show that integrating attendance data with emotion analytics can provide instructors with additional insight into classroom dynamics and support more responsive teaching practices.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we further upper bound mutual information and maximal leakage by explicit, easily computable formulas, using typicality-based arguments and exploiting the stability properties of private algorithms. In the first part of the paper, we strictly improve the mutual-information bounds by Rodr\u00edguez-G\u00e1lvez et al. (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2021).

However, point-level maize localization in UAV imagery remains challenging due to (1) extremely small object-to-pixel ratios, typically less than 0.1%, (2) prohibitive computational costs of quadratic attention on ultra-high-resolution images larger than 3000 x 4000 pixels, and (3) agricultural scene-specific complexities such as sparse object distribution and environmental variability that are poorly handled by general-purpose vision models.\n  To address these challenges, we propose the Additive Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (AKT), which replaces conventional multilayer perceptrons with Pade Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (PKAN) modules to enhance functional expressivity for small-object feature extraction, and introduces PKAN Additive Attention (PAA) to model multiscale spatial dependencies with reduced computational complexity. In addition, we present the Point-based Maize Localization (PML) dataset, consisting of 1,928 high-resolution UAV images with approximately 501,000 point annotations collected under real field conditions.\n  Extensive experiments show that AKT achieves an average F1-score of 62.8%, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 4.2%, while reducing FLOPs by 12.6% and improving inference throughput by 20.7%. For downstream tasks, AKT attains a mean absolute error of 7.1 in stand counting and a root mean square error of 1.95-1.97 cm in interplant spacing estimation.

While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced emotion analysis, they have not been adapted to handle the unique spatiotemporal characteristics of neural signals. We present E^2-LLM (EEG-to-Emotion Large Language Model), the first MLLM framework for interpretable emotion analysis from EEG. E^2-LLM integrates a pretrained EEG encoder with Qwen-based LLMs through learnable projection layers, employing a multi-stage training pipeline that encompasses emotion-discriminative pretraining, cross-modal alignment, and instruction tuning with chain-of-thought reasoning. We design a comprehensive evaluation protocol covering basic emotion prediction, multi-task reasoning, and zero-shot scenario understanding. Experiments on the dataset across seven emotion categories demonstrate that E^2-LLM achieves excellent performance on emotion classification, with larger variants showing enhanced reliability and superior zero-shot generalization to complex reasoning scenarios.

With increasing renewable energy integration, sustainable energy management has become essential for reducing grid dependence and supporting the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 on affordable and clean energy. However, the intermittent nature of renewables poses challenges in balancing supply and demand in real time. Intelligent load scheduling is therefore crucial to minimize operational costs while maintaining reliability. Reinforcement Learning has shown promise in improving energy efficiency and reducing costs. However, most RL-based scheduling methods assume complete knowledge of future prices or generation, which is unrealistic in dynamic environments. Moreover, standard PPO variants rely on fixed clipping or KL divergence thresholds, often leading to unstable training under variable tariffs. To address these challenges, this study proposes a Deep Reinforcement Learning framework for efficient load scheduling in dairy farms, focusing on battery storage and water heating under realistic operational constraints. The proposed Forecast Aware PPO incorporates short term forecasts of demand and renewable generation using hour of day and month based residual calibration, while the PID KL PPO variant employs a proportional integral derivative controller to regulate KL divergence for stable policy updates adaptively. Trained on real world dairy farm data, the method achieves up to 1% lower electricity cost than PPO, 4.8% than DQN, and 1.5% than SAC. For battery scheduling, PPO reduces grid imports by 13.1%, demonstrating scalability and effectiveness for sustainable energy management in modern dairy farming.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, as we show, the algorithm can be easily generalized to sample dual-containing LDPC codes over non binary finite fields as well as more general quantum stabilizer LDPC codes.\n  While several constructions already exist, all of them are somewhat algebraic as they impose some specific property (e.g., the matrix being quasi-cyclic). Instead, our algorithm is purely combinatorial as we do not require anything apart from the rows of $\\mathbf H$ being sparse enough. In this sense, we can think of our algorithm as a way to sample sparse, self-orthogonal matrices that are as random as possible.\n  Our algorithm is conceptually very simple and, as a key ingredient, uses Information Set Decoding (ISD) to sample the rows of $\\mathbf H$, one at a time. The use of ISD is fundamental as, without it, efficient sampling would not be feasible.

Model quantization improves energy and memory efficiency through representing model parameters by lower-precision values. However, compression below 4-bits often distorts activation distributions and degrades performance. We address this challenge by introducing a sliced Wasserstein loss function for distribution-aware calibration in ultra-low-bit post-training quantization. The proposed loss aligns the output distributions of full-precision and quantized models under random linear projections, complementing standard mean-squared error loss without adding any computational overhead during inference. Our proposed loss function can be incorporated with any post-training quantization framework that has a retraining component. We demonstrate the performance gains of our proposed model by incorporating it with two frontier methods known as OmniQuant and TesseraQ. Compared to these two baselines, the proposed loss consistently improves both perplexity and downstream task accuracy across multiple ultra-low-bit settings. Our proposed loss function recovers 4.12-20.37% of the OmniQuant's lost accuracy on the language model LLaMA-2-7B, 0.93-7.65% on OPT-6.7B, and 2.26-6.20% on LLaMA-2-13B.

Previous works either focus on optimal performance, simplifying the controllability issue, or make the system controllable under structural assumptions, such as in graphs or when the input matrix is a design parameter. We generalize these approaches to offer a precise characterization of the general minimal actuator selection problem where a set of actuators is given, described by a fixed input matrix, and goal is to choose the fewest actuators that make the system controllable. We show that this problem can be equivalently cast as an integer linear program and, if actuation channels are sufficiently independent, as a set multicover problem under multiplicity constraints.

Repeated sampling over the same input often produces divergent reasoning trajectories and inconsistent final predictions.

CASHEW-RL is trained using Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) with a composite reward that encourages correct answers grounded in minimal yet sufficient visual evidence, while adaptively allocating reasoning effort based on task difficulty.

By shifting to renewable energy sources and supporting their production through the acquisition of renewable energy certificates, we foster innovation and drive economic growth in the renewable energy sector. This, in turn, reduces greenhouse gas emissions, aligning with global efforts to mitigate climate change. Additionally, renewable energy certificates ensure compliance with regulations that mandate the use of renewable energy, enhancing legal adherence while promoting transparency and trust in energy sourcing. To monitor the uptake of renewable energy, governments have implemented Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) as a tracking mechanism for the production and consumption of renewable energy. However, there are two main challenges to the existing REC schema: 1) The RECs have not been globally adopted due to inconsistent design; 2) The consumer privacy has not been well incorporated in the design of blockchain. In this study, we investigate the trading of RECs between suppliers and consumers using the directed acyclic graph (DAG) blockchain system and introduce a trading schema to help protect consumer information.

We present Twin-Prompt Attention Blend (TP-Blend), a lightweight training-free framework that receives two separate textual prompts, one specifying a blend object and the other defining a target style, and injects both into a single denoising trajectory. TP-Blend is driven by two complementary attention processors. Cross-Attention Object Fusion (CAOF) first averages head-wise attention to locate spatial tokens that respond strongly to either prompt, then solves an entropy-regularised optimal transport problem that reassigns complete multi-head feature vectors to those positions. CAOF updates feature vectors at the full combined dimensionality of all heads (e.g., 640 dimensions in SD-XL), preserving rich cross-head correlations while keeping memory low. Self-Attention Style Fusion (SASF) injects style at every self-attention layer through Detail-Sensitive Instance Normalization. A lightweight one-dimensional Gaussian filter separates low- and high-frequency components; only the high-frequency residual is blended back, imprinting brush-stroke-level texture without disrupting global geometry. SASF further swaps the Key and Value matrices with those derived from the style prompt, enforcing context-aware texture modulation that remains independent of object fusion. Extensive experiments show that TP-Blend produces high-resolution, photo-realistic edits with precise control over both content and appearance, surpassing recent baselines in quantitative fidelity, perceptual quality, and inference speed.", "AI": {"tldr": "TP-Blend\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u5206\u522b\u63a7\u5236\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5bf9\u8c61\u878d\u5408\uff08CAOF\uff09\u548c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u98ce\u683c\u878d\u5408\uff08SASF\uff09\u6280\u672f\u5728\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u6ce8\u5165\u65b0\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u65b0\u98ce\u683c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u6269\u6563\u7f16\u8f91\u5668\u80fd\u5f88\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u5355\u4e00\u5bf9\u8c61\u66ff\u6362\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u65b0\u98ce\u683c\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u540c\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u5916\u89c2\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "TP-Blend\u63a5\u6536\u4e24\u4e2a\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\uff08\u5bf9\u8c61\u548c\u98ce\u683c\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5904\u7406\u5668\u6ce8\u5165\u5355\u4e2a\u53bb\u566a\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1a1\uff09CAOF\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u95ee\u9898\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u591a\u5934\u7279\u5f81\u5411\u91cf\uff1b2\uff09SASF\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec6\u8282\u654f\u611f\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5728\u6bcf\u5c42\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u98ce\u683c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e00\u7ef4\u9ad8\u65af\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u5206\u79bb\u9891\u57df\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u4ea4\u6362Key\u548cValue\u77e9\u9635\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eTP-Blend\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3001\u903c\u771f\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u5916\u89c2\u4e0a\u90fd\u6709\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u5b9a\u91cf\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "TP-Blend\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u5bf9\u8c61\u878d\u5408\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u6ce8\u5165\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u540c\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u5185\u5bb9\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

While ternary quantization offers a compelling solution by reducing weights to {-1, 0, +1}, current implementations suffer from a fundamental misalignment with commodity hardware. Most existing methods must choose between 2-bit aligned packing, which incurs significant bit wastage, or 1.67-bit irregular packing, which degrades inference speed. To resolve this tension, we propose Sherry, a hardware-efficient ternary quantization framework. Sherry introduces a 3:4 fine-grained sparsity that achieves a regularized 1.25-bit width by packing blocks of four weights into five bits, restoring power-of-two alignment. Furthermore, we identify weight trapping issue in sparse ternary training, which leads to representational collapse. To address this, Sherry introduces Arenas, an annealing residual synapse mechanism that maintains representational diversity during training. Empirical evaluations on LLaMA-3.2 across five benchmarks demonstrate that Sherry matches state-of-the-art ternary performance while significantly reducing model size. Notably, on an Intel i7-14700HX CPU, our 1B model achieves zero accuracy loss compared to SOTA baselines while providing 25% bit savings and 10% speed up.

In such systems, performance is often limited by the straggler problem, where the slowest worker dominates the overall computation latency. To resolve this issue, several coded computing strategies have been proposed, primarily focusing on the simplest case: the multiplication of two matrices. These approaches successfully alleviate the straggler effect, but they do so at the expense of higher computational complexity and increased storage needs at the workers. However, in many real-world applications, computations naturally involve long chains of matrix multiplications rather than just a single two-matrix product. Extending univariate polynomial coding to this setting has been shown to amplify the costs -- both computation and storage overheads grow significantly, limiting scalability. In this work, we propose two novel multivariate polynomial coding schemes specifically designed for matrix chain multiplication in distributed environments. Our results show that while multivariate codes introduce additional computational cost at the workers, they can dramatically reduce storage overhead compared to univariate extensions. This reveals a fundamental trade-off between computation and storage efficiency, and highlights the potential of multivariate codes as a practical solution for large-scale distributed linear algebra tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Knoop", "David Z. W. Wang", "Yu Han"], "title": "How vehicles change lanes after encountering crashes: Empirical analysis and modeling", "comment": null, "summary": "When a traffic crash occurs, following vehicles need to change lanes to bypass the obstruction. We define these maneuvers as post crash lane changes. In such scenarios, vehicles in the target lane may refuse to yield even after the lane change has already begun, increasing the complexity and crash risk of post crash LCs. However, the behavioral characteristics and motion patterns of post crash LCs remain unknown. To address this gap, we construct a post crash LC dataset by extracting vehicle trajectories from drone videos captured after crashes. Our empirical analysis reveals that, compared to mandatory LCs (MLCs) and discretionary LCs (DLCs), post crash LCs exhibit longer durations, lower insertion speeds, and higher crash risks. Notably, 79.4% of post crash LCs involve at least one instance of non yielding behavior from the new follower, compared to 21.7% for DLCs and 28.6% for MLCs. Building on these findings, we develop a novel trajectory prediction framework for post crash LCs. At its core is a graph based attention module that explicitly models yielding behavior as an auxiliary interaction aware task. This module is designed to guide both a conditional variational autoencoder and a Transformer based decoder to predict the lane changer's trajectory. By incorporating the interaction aware module, our model outperforms existing baselines in trajectory prediction performance by more than 10% in both average displacement error and final displacement error across different prediction horizons. Moreover, our model provides more reliable crash risk analysis by reducing false crash rates and improving conflict prediction accuracy. Finally, we validate the model's transferability using additional post crash LC datasets collected from different sites.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4ea4\u901a\u4e8b\u6545\u540e\u8f66\u8f86\u53d8\u9053\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u5efa\u6a21\u8ba9\u884c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ea4\u901a\u4e8b\u6545\u540e\uff0c\u540e\u7eed\u8f66\u8f86\u9700\u8981\u53d8\u9053\u7ed5\u8fc7\u969c\u788d\u7269\uff0c\u4f46\u76ee\u6807\u8f66\u9053\u8f66\u8f86\u53ef\u80fd\u62d2\u7edd\u8ba9\u884c\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u53d8\u9053\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u78b0\u649e\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u5bf9\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e8b\u6545\u540e\u53d8\u9053\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u89c6\u9891\u63d0\u53d6\u4e8b\u6545\u540e\u8f66\u8f86\u8f68\u8ff9\u6784\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b0\u4e8b\u6545\u540e\u53d8\u9053\u5177\u6709\u6301\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\u3001\u63d2\u5165\u901f\u5ea6\u4f4e\u3001\u78b0\u649e\u98ce\u9669\u9ad8\u7b49\u7279\u70b9\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b\u56fe\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u5757\u5c06\u8ba9\u884c\u884c\u4e3a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u611f\u77e5\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5206\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u53d8\u9053\u8f66\u8f86\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u8d85\u8fc710%\uff08\u5e73\u5747\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u6700\u7ec8\u4f4d\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u78b0\u649e\u98ce\u9669\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u51b2\u7a81\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5730\u70b9\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u989d\u5916\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u53d1\u73b079.4%\u7684\u4e8b\u6545\u540e\u53d8\u9053\u6d89\u53ca\u5230\u65b0\u8ddf\u968f\u8005\u81f3\u5c11\u4e00\u6b21\u4e0d\u8ba9\u884c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u8fdc\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u53d8\u9053\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e8b\u6545\u540e\u53d8\u9053\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5efa\u6a21\u8ba9\u884c\u884c\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u597d\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u7ba1\u7406\u4e8b\u6545\u540e\u7684\u4ea4\u901a\u72b6\u51b5\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e8c\u6b21\u4e8b\u6545\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

More precisely, we have established formula for counting codewords in the linear code C whose i-th coordinate is nonzero. Moreover, we derived a MacWilliam's type identity, relating the normalized support enumerators of a linear code and its dual, explaining how coordinate information transforms under duality. Using this identity we deduce a condition for self duality based on the equality of support distributions.

This study proposes a multiobjective model predictive control approach for home energy management systems with battery storage, aiming to minimize both objectives while mitigating uncertainties.

We apply our approach to hundreds of concepts across seven layers in Gemma 3, and find that the synthesised images often depict salient visual features of the targeted textual concepts: for example, already at layer 1, more than 50 % of images depict recognisable features of animals, activities, or seasons. Our method thus provides direct, constructive evidence of image-text alignment on a concept-by-concept and layer-by-layer basis.

In this work, we study the error- and erasure-correction performance of binary linear LRCs under majority-logic decoding (MLD). Focusing on LRCs with fixed locality and varying availability, we derive explicit upper bounds on the probability of decoding failure over the memoryless Binary Erasure Channel (BEC) and Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC). Our analysis characterizes the behavior of the bit-error rate (BER) and block-error rate (BLER) as functions of the locality and availability parameters. We show that, under mild growth conditions on the availability, the block decoding failure probability vanishes asymptotically, and that majority-logic decoding can successfully correct virtually all of error and erasure patterns of weight linear in the blocklength.

Using a sensitivity analysis, we find that varying contact resistances and cell resistances contribute strongly to temperature differences between cells, from which we define safety thresholds on cell-to-cell variability.

While recent ZSAD approaches leverage additional modalities such as language to generate fine-grained prompts for localisation, vision-only methods remain limited to image-level classification, lacking spatial precision. In this work, we introduce a simple yet effective training-free vision-only ZSAD framework that circumvents the need for fine-grained prompts by leveraging the inversion of a pretrained Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM). Specifically, given an input image and a generic text description (e.g., \"an image of an [object class]\"), we invert the image to obtain latent representations and initiate the denoising process from a fixed intermediate timestep to reconstruct the image. Since the underlying diffusion model is trained solely on normal data, this process yields a normal-looking reconstruction. The discrepancy between the input image and the reconstructed one highlights potential anomalies.

Time series forecasting (TSF) is a key means to achieve this goal. In recent years, the large language models (LLMs) for TSF (LLM4TSF) have achieved good performance. However, there is a significant difference between pretraining corpora and time series data, making it hard to guarantee forecasting quality when directly applying LLMs to TSF; fine-tuning LLMs can mitigate this issue, but often incurs substantial computational overhead. Thus, LLM4TSF faces a dual challenge of prediction performance and compute overhead. To address this, we aim to explore a method for improving the forecasting performance of LLM4TSF while freezing all LLM parameters to reduce computational overhead. Inspired by in-context learning (ICL), we propose LVICL. LVICL uses our vector-injected ICL to inject example information into a frozen LLM, eliciting its in-context learning ability and thereby enhancing its performance on the example-related task (i.e., TSF). Specifically, we first use the LLM together with a learnable context vector adapter to extract a context vector from multiple examples adaptively. This vector contains compressed, example-related information. Subsequently, during the forward pass, we inject this vector into every layer of the LLM to improve forecasting performance. Compared with conventional ICL that adds examples into the prompt, our vector-injected ICL does not increase prompt length; moreover, adaptively deriving a context vector from examples suppresses components harmful to forecasting, thereby improving model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The efficiency of roll-to-roll slot die coating depends on the precise control of various input parameters such as pump rate, substrate velocity and coating gap. However, these inputs are sensitive to disturbances in process conditions, leading to inconsistencies in the various characteristics of the produced film. To address this challenge, a \\gls{DO} is utilized for detecting disturbances, which may occur in the same or different channels as the control signal within the system. A generalized compensator is then implemented to mitigate the impact of these disturbances on the output, thereby enhancing uncertainty suppression. Additionally, integrating the disturbance rejection system with an output tracking controller enables the coating system to maintain the desired thickness under varying input conditions and disturbances. The effectiveness of this approach is then validated using a test rig equipped with a camera system, which facilitates the development of a data-driven model of the dynamic process, represented by state-space equations. The simulation results were demonstrated to showcase the effectiveness of the DOBOTC system, which provides a resilient solution for the output tracking issue in a data-driven model with generalized disturbances.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e72\u6270\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u5347\u5377\u5bf9\u5377\u72ed\u7f1d\u6d82\u5e03\u5de5\u827a\u4e2d\u5bf9\u8584\u819c\u539a\u5ea6\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5377\u5bf9\u5377\u72ed\u7f1d\u6d82\u5e03\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u751f\u4ea7\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8f93\u5165\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9\u5de5\u827a\u6270\u52a8\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8584\u819c\u7279\u6027\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u6291\u5236\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u6d82\u5c42\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5e72\u6270\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\uff08DO\uff09\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5e7f\u4e49\u8865\u507f\u5668\u51cf\u5c11\u6270\u52a8\u5bf9\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u8f93\u51fa\u8ddf\u8e2a\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u4ee5\u7ef4\u6301\u671f\u671b\u7684\u6d82\u5c42\u539a\u5ea6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5e26\u76f8\u673a\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bd5\u9a8c\u53f0\u5efa\u7acb\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u89c2\u6d4b\u5668\u8f93\u51fa\u8ddf\u8e2a\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f93\u51fa\u8ddf\u8e2a\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5e72\u6270\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8865\u507f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u5377\u5bf9\u5377\u6d82\u5e03\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6291\u5236\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u5728\u53d8\u5316\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u6d82\u5c42\u539a\u5ea6\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u4ea7\u5de5\u827a\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing approaches either rely on utilization-based heuristics that overlook stall times, or require extensive offline profiling for table generation, preventing runtime adaptation. We propose a model-based hierarchical multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework for thermal- and energy-aware scheduling on multi-core platforms. Two collaborative agents decompose the exponential action space, achieving 358ms latency for subsequent decisions. First decisions require 3.5 to 8.0s including one-time LLM feature extraction. An accurate environment model leverages regression techniques to predict thermal dynamics and performance states. When combined with LLM-extracted semantic features, the environment model enables zero-shot deployment for new workloads on trained platforms by generating synthetic training data without requiring workload-specific profiling samples. We introduce LLM-based semantic feature extraction that characterizes OpenMP programs through 13 code-level features without execution. The Dyna-Q-inspired framework integrates direct reinforcement learning with model-based planning, achieving 20x faster convergence than model-free methods. Experiments on BOTS and PolybenchC benchmarks across NVIDIA Jetson TX2, Jetson Orin NX, RubikPi, and Intel Core i7 demonstrate 7.09x better energy efficiency and 4.0x better makespan than Linux ondemand governor.

To bridge this gap, we introduce \\method{}, a dynamic evaluation environment that simulates a \"trainee\" agent continuously exploring a novel setting. Unlike traditional benchmarks, \\method{} evaluates agents along three dimensions: (1) context-aware scheduling for streaming tasks with varying priorities; (2) prudent information acquisition to reduce hallucination via active exploration; and (3) continuous evolution by distilling generalized strategies from rule-based, dynamically generated tasks. Experiments show that cutting-edge agents have significant deficiencies in dynamic environments, especially in active exploration and continual learning.

Existing goal-conditioned and hierarchical offline RL methods decompose such tasks and generate intermediate rewards to mitigate limitations of traditional offline RL, but usually overlook temporal dependencies among subgoals and rely on imprecise reward shaping, leading to suboptimal policies. To address these issues, we propose STO-RL (Offline RL using LLM-Guided Subgoal Temporal Order), an offline RL framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate temporally ordered subgoal sequences and corresponding state-to-subgoal-stage mappings. Using this temporal structure, STO-RL applies potential-based reward shaping to transform sparse terminal rewards into dense, temporally consistent signals, promoting subgoal progress while avoiding suboptimal solutions. The resulting augmented dataset with shaped rewards enables efficient offline training of high-performing policies. Evaluations on four discrete and continuous sparse-reward benchmarks demonstrate that STO-RL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art offline goal-conditioned and hierarchical RL baselines, achieving faster convergence, higher success rates, and shorter trajectories. Ablation studies further confirm STO-RL's robustness to imperfect or noisy LLM-generated subgoal sequences, demonstrating that LLM-guided subgoal temporal structures combined with theoretically grounded reward shaping provide a practical and scalable solution for long-horizon offline RL.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, classical approaches such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) often struggle to preserve the higher-order statistical structure of fluid flows when subjected to strong compression. We propose DiffCoder, a coupled framework that integrates a probabilistic diffusion model with a conventional convolutional ResNet encoder and trains both components end-to-end. The encoder compresses the flow field into a latent representation, while the diffusion model learns a generative prior over reconstructions conditioned on the compressed state. This design allows DiffCoder to recover distributional and spectral properties that are not strictly required for minimizing pointwise reconstruction loss but are critical for faithfully representing statistical properties of the flow field. We evaluate DiffCoder and VAE baselines across multiple model sizes and compression ratios on a challenging dataset of Kolmogorov flow fields. Under aggressive compression, DiffCoder significantly improves the spectral accuracy while VAEs exhibit substantial degradation. Although both methods show comparable relative L2 reconstruction error, DiffCoder better preserves the underlying distributional structure of the flow. At moderate compression levels, sufficiently large VAEs remain competitive, suggesting that diffusion-based priors provide the greatest benefit when information bottlenecks are severe. These results demonstrate that the generative decoding by diffusion offers a promising path toward compact, statistically consistent representations of complex flow fields.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recent studies typically focus on verbalizing the graph structures via handcrafted prompts, feeding the target node and its neighborhood context into LLMs. However, constrained by the context window, existing methods mainly resort to random sampling, often implemented via dropping node/edge randomly, which inevitably introduces noise and cause reasoning instability. We argue that graphs inherently contain rich structural and semantic information, and that their effective exploitation can unlock potential gains in LLMs reasoning performance. To this end, we propose Homophily-aware Structural and Semantic Compression for LLMs (HS2C), a framework centered on exploiting graph homophily. Structurally, guided by the principle of Structural Entropy minimization, we perform a global hierarchical partition that decodes the graph's essential topology. This partition identifies naturally cohesive, homophilic communities, while discarding stochastic connectivity noise. Semantically, we deliver the detected structural homophily to the LLM, empowering it to perform differentiated semantic aggregation based on predefined community type. This process compresses redundant background contexts into concise community-level consensus, selectively preserving semantically homophilic information aligned with the target nodes.

A fundamental difficulty in online RL is the lack of direct samples from the target distribution; instead, the target is an unnormalized Boltzmann distribution defined by the Q-function. To address this, two seemingly distinct families of methods have been proposed for diffusion policies: a noise-expectation family, which utilizes a weighted average of noise as the training target, and a gradient-expectation family, which employs a weighted average of Q-function gradients. Yet, it remains unclear how these objectives relate formally or if they can be synthesized into a more general formulation. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, reverse flow matching (RFM), which rigorously addresses the problem of training diffusion and flow models without direct target samples. By adopting a reverse inferential perspective, we formulate the training target as a posterior mean estimation problem given an intermediate noisy sample. Crucially, we introduce Langevin Stein operators to construct zero-mean control variates, deriving a general class of estimators that effectively reduce importance sampling variance. We show that existing noise-expectation and gradient-expectation methods are two specific instances within this broader class. This unified view yields two key advancements: it extends the capability of targeting Boltzmann distributions from diffusion to flow policies, and enables the principled combination of Q-value and Q-gradient information to derive an optimal, minimum-variance estimator, thereby improving training efficiency and stability. We instantiate RFM to train a flow policy in online RL, and demonstrate improved performance on continuous-control benchmarks compared to diffusion policy baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u2014\u2014\u53cd\u5411\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff08RFM\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u63a5\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u6837\u672c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u548c\u6d41\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u6717\u4e4b\u4e07\u65af\u5766\u7b97\u5b50\u6765\u6784\u5efa\u96f6\u5747\u503c\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u5dee\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u548c\u6d41\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u56e0\u5176\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u5f3a\u800c\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u63a5\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u6837\u672c\uff08\u76ee\u6807\u4e3a\u672a\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u73bb\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u5206\u5e03\uff09\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u566a\u58f0\u671f\u671b\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u671f\u671b\u5bb6\u65cf\uff09\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53cd\u5411\u6d41\u5339\u914d\uff08RFM\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u53cd\u5411\u63a8\u65ad\u89c6\u89d2\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7ed9\u5b9a\u4e2d\u95f4\u566a\u58f0\u6837\u672c\u7684\u540e\u9a8c\u5747\u503c\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u6717\u4e4b\u4e07\u65af\u5766\u7b97\u5b50\u6784\u5efa\u96f6\u5747\u503c\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u901a\u7528\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u566a\u58f0\u671f\u671b\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u671f\u671b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7edf\u4e00\u4e3a\u8be5\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u7279\u4f8b\u3002", "result": "RFM\u6846\u67b6\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u9488\u5bf9\u73bb\u5c14\u5179\u66fc\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u4ece\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u5230\u6d41\u7b56\u7565\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408Q\u503c\u548cQ\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u65b9\u5dee\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3002\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u63a7\u5236\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eRFM\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6d41\u7b56\u7565\u76f8\u6bd4\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u57fa\u7ebf\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "RFM\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u548c\u6d41\u7b56\u7565\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u5c11\u65b9\u5dee\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u5230\u6d41\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Recently, self-supervised foundation models such as DINOv3, which were trained on large natural image datasets, have shown strong potential for dense feature extraction that can help with the few-shot learning challenge. Yet, their direct application to medical images is hindered by domain differences. In this work, we propose DINO-AugSeg, a novel framework that leverages DINOv3 features to address the few-shot medical image segmentation challenge. Specifically, we introduce WT-Aug, a wavelet-based feature-level augmentation module that enriches the diversity of DINOv3-extracted features by perturbing frequency components, and CG-Fuse, a contextual information-guided fusion module that exploits cross-attention to integrate semantic-rich low-resolution features with spatially detailed high-resolution features. Extensive experiments on six public benchmarks spanning five imaging modalities, including MRI, CT, ultrasound, endoscopy, and dermoscopy, demonstrate that DINO-AugSeg consistently outperforms existing methods under limited-sample conditions. The results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating wavelet-domain augmentation and contextual fusion for robust feature representation, suggesting DINO-AugSeg as a promising direction for advancing few-shot medical image segmentation.

Temperature data represents a complex superposition of deterministic cyclical climate forces and stochastic, short-term fluctuations. While planetary mechanics drive predictable seasonal periodicities, rapid meteorological changes such as thermal variations, pressure anomalies, and humidity shifts introduce nonlinear volatilities that defy simple extrapolation. Historically, the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model has been the standard for modeling historical weather data, prized for capturing linear seasonal trends. However, SARIMA operates under strict assumptions of stationarity, failing to capture abrupt, nonlinear transitions. This leads to systematic residual errors, manifesting as the under-prediction of sudden spikes or the over-smoothing of declines. Conversely, Deep Learning paradigms, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, demonstrate exceptional efficacy in handling intricate time-series data. By utilizing memory gates, LSTMs learn complex nonlinear dependencies. Yet, LSTMs face instability in open-loop forecasting; without ground truth feedback, minor deviations compound recursively, causing divergence. To resolve these limitations, we propose a Hybrid SARIMA-LSTM architecture. This framework employs a residual-learning strategy to decompose temperature into a predictable climate component and a nonlinear weather component. The SARIMA unit models the robust, long-term seasonal trend, while the LSTM is trained exclusively on the residuals the nonlinear errors SARIMA fails to capture. By fusing statistical stability with neural plasticity, this hybrid approach minimizes error propagation and enhances long-horizon accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing systems implicitly presuppose fixed primitive units -- tokens, subwords, pixels, or predefined sensor channels -- thereby bypassing the question of how representational units themselves emerge and stabilize. This paper proposes SANC(E3), an axiomatic framework in which representational units are not given a priori but instead arise as stable outcomes of competitive selection, reconstruction, and compression under finite activation capacity, governed by the explicit minimization of an energy functional E3. SANC(E3) draws a principled distinction between system tokens -- structural anchors such as {here, now, I} and sensory sources -- and tokens that emerge through self-organization during co-occurring events. Five core axioms formalize finite capacity, association from co-occurrence, similarity-based competition, confidence-based stabilization, and the reconstruction-compression-update trade-off. A key feature is a pseudo-memory-mapped I/O mechanism, through which internally replayed Gestalts are processed via the same axiomatic pathway as external sensory input.

However, conventional estimated time of arrival (ETA) models are primarily designed for the immediate next port of call and rely heavily on real-time automatic identification system (AIS) data, which is inherently unavailable for future voyage segments. To address this gap, the study reformulates future-port ETA prediction as a segment-level time-series forecasting problem. We develop a transformer-based architecture that integrates historical sailing durations, destination port congestion proxies, and static vessel descriptors. The proposed framework employs a causally masked attention mechanism to capture long-range temporal dependencies and a multi-task learning head to jointly predict segment sailing durations and port congestion states, leveraging shared latent signals to mitigate high uncertainty. Evaluation on a real-world global dataset from 2021 demonstrates the proposed model consistently outperforms a comprehensive suite of competitive baselines. The result shows a relative reduction of 4.85% in mean absolute error (MAE) and 4.95% in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) compared with sequence baseline models. The relative reductions with gradient boosting machines are 9.39% in MAE and 52.97% in MAPE.

This difficulty is amplified by credit assignment ambiguity, environmental non-stationarity, and the combinatorial growth of interaction complexity. We argue that recent advances in large language models (LLMs) point toward a shift from hand-crafted numerical rewards to language-based objective specifications. Prior work has shown that LLMs can synthesize reward functions directly from natural language descriptions (e.g., EUREKA) and adapt reward formulations online with minimal human intervention (e.g., CARD). In parallel, the emerging paradigm of Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) provides empirical evidence that language-mediated supervision can serve as a viable alternative to traditional reward engineering. We conceptualize this transition along three dimensions: semantic reward specification, dynamic reward adaptation, and improved alignment with human intent, while noting open challenges related to computational overhead, robustness to hallucination, and scalability to large multi-agent systems.

We introduce a novel collaborative framework, \\textit{S}tepping \\textit{S}tone \\textit{P}lus (SSP), which integrates optical flow and textual prompts to assist the segmentation process. In scenarios where sound sources frequently coexist with moving objects, our pre-mask technique leverages optical flow to capture motion dynamics, providing essential temporal context for precise segmentation. To address the challenge posed by stationary sound-emitting objects, such as alarm clocks, SSP incorporates two specific textual prompts: one identifies the category of the sound-emitting object, and the other provides a broader description of the scene. Additionally, we implement a visual-textual alignment module (VTA) to facilitate cross-modal integration, delivering more coherent and contextually relevant semantic interpretations. Our training regimen involves a post-mask technique aimed at compelling the model to learn the diagram of the optical flow.

However, GNNs rely on two key operations - aggregation and update, which can pose challenges for low-latency inference tasks or resource-constrained scenarios. Simple Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) offer a computationally efficient alternative. Yet, training an MLP in a supervised setting often leads to suboptimal performance. Knowledge Distillation (KD) from a GNN teacher to an MLP student has emerged to bridge this gap. However, most KD methods either transfer knowledge uniformly across all nodes or rely on graph-agnostic indicators such as prediction uncertainty. We argue this overlooks a more fundamental, graph-centric inquiry: \"How important is a node to the structure of the graph?\" We introduce a framework, InfGraND, an Influence-guided Graph KNowledge Distillation from GNN to MLP that addresses this by identifying and prioritizing structurally influential nodes to guide the distillation process, ensuring that the MLP learns from the most critical parts of the graph. Additionally, InfGraND embeds structural awareness in MLPs through one-time multi-hop neighborhood feature pre-computation, which enriches the student MLP's input and thus avoids inference-time overhead. Our rigorous evaluation in transductive and inductive settings across seven homophilic graph benchmark datasets shows InfGraND consistently outperforms prior GNN to MLP KD methods, demonstrating its practicality for numerous latency-critical applications in real-world settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "InfGraND\uff1a\u7528\u8282\u70b9\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u5f15\u5bfc\u56fe\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4eceGNN\u5411MLP\u9ad8\u6548\u4f20\u8f93\u77e5\u8bc6", "motivation": "GNN\u4f9d\u8d56\u805a\u5408\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u6216\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\u3002\u5c3d\u7ba1MLP\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u8282\u70b9\u5728\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8fd9\u4e00\u6839\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "InfGraND\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u4f18\u5148\u5904\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0a\u6709\u5f71\u54cd\u529b\u7684\u8282\u70b9\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u84b8\u998f\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u786e\u4fddMLP\u4ece\u56fe\u7684\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u5206\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u591a\u8df3\u90bb\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u9884\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e3aMLP\u5d4c\u5165\u7ed3\u6784\u610f\u8bc6\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u63a8\u7406\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u540c\u8d28\u6027\u56fe\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u4e25\u683c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cInfGraND\u5728\u4f20\u5bfc\u6027\u548c\u5f52\u7eb3\u6027\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684GNN\u5230MLP\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "InfGraND\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u4eceGNN\u5411MLP\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4f17\u591a\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5173\u952e\u578b\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Test-time adaptation (TTA) emerges as a predominant strategy to adapt VLMs to unlabeled test data on the fly. However, existing TTA methods heavily rely on zero-shot predictions as pseudo-labels for self-training, which can be unreliable under distribution shifts and misguide adaptation due to two fundamental limitations. First (Modality Gap), distribution shifts induce gaps between visual and textual modalities, making cross-modal relations inaccurate. Second (Visual Nuisance), visual embeddings encode rich but task-irrelevant noise that often overwhelms task-specific semantics under distribution shifts. To address these limitations, we propose SubTTA, which aligns the semantic subspaces of both modalities to enhance zero-shot predictions to better guide the TTA process. To bridge the modality gap, SubTTA extracts the principal subspaces of both modalities and aligns the visual manifold to the textual semantic anchor by minimizing their chordal distance. To eliminate visual nuisance, SubTTA projects the aligned visual features onto the task-specific textual subspace, which filters out task-irrelevant noise by constraining visual embeddings within the valid semantic span, and standard TTA is further performed on the purified space to refine the decision boundaries. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks and VLM architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of SubTTA, yielding an average improvement of 2.24% over state-of-the-art TTA methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this challenge, we construct structure-preserving metrics that are geodesically complete while ensuring that every stationary point under the new metric remains stationary under the original one. Building on this foundation, we revisit the classical symmetric two-point zeroth-order estimator and analyze its mean-squared error from a purely intrinsic perspective, depending only on the manifold's geometry rather than any ambient embedding. Leveraging this intrinsic analysis, we establish convergence guarantees for stochastic gradient descent with this intrinsic estimator. Under additional suitable conditions, an $\u03b5$-stationary point under the constructed metric $g'$ also corresponds to an $\u03b5$-stationary point under the original metric $g$, thereby matching the best-known complexity in the geodesically complete setting. Empirical studies on synthetic problems confirm our theoretical findings, and experiments on a practical mesh optimization task demonstrate that our framework maintains stable convergence even in the absence of geodesic completeness.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To bridge this gap, we perform a systematic layer-wise masking analysis across multiple architectures, revealing how visual-text fusion evolves within MLLMs. The results show that fusion emerges at several specific layers rather than being uniformly distributed across the network, and certain models exhibit a late-stage \"review\" phenomenon where visual signals are reactivated before output generation. Besides, we further analyze layer-wise attention evolution and observe persistent high-attention noise on irrelevant regions, along with gradually increasing attention on text-aligned areas. Guided by these insights, we introduce a training-free contrastive attention framework that models the transformation between early fusion and final layers to highlight meaningful attention shifts.

Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) offer a compact alternative to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) by placing learnable univariate spline functions on edges rather than fixed activations on nodes, achieving competitive accuracy with fewer parameters. However, runtime B-spline evaluation introduces significant computational overhead unsuitable for latency-critical IoT applications. We propose a lookup table (LUT) compilation pipeline that replaces expensive spline computations with precomputed quantized tables and linear interpolation, dramatically reducing inference latency while preserving detection quality. Our lightweight KAN model (50K parameters, 0.19~MB) achieves 99.0\\% accuracy on the CICIDS2017 DoS dataset. After LUT compilation with resolution $L=8$, the model maintains 98.96\\% accuracy (F1 degradation $<0.0004$) while achieving $\\mathbf{68\\times}$ speedup at batch size 256 and over $\\mathbf{5000\\times}$ speedup at batch size 1, with only $2\\times$ memory overhead. We provide comprehensive evaluation across LUT resolutions, quantization schemes, and out-of-bounds policies, establishing clear Pareto frontiers for accuracy-latency-memory trade-offs.

This limitation is especially pronounced in multi-entity interactions, where existing explainable VAD methods often produce incomplete or visually misaligned descriptions, reducing their trustworthiness. To address these challenges, we introduce instance-aligned captions that link each textual claim to specific object instances with appearance and motion attributes. Our framework captures who caused the anomaly, what each entity was doing, whom it affected, and where the explanationis grounded, enabling verifiable and actionable reasoning. We annotate eight widely used VAD benchmarks and extend the 360-degree egocentric dataset, VIEW360, with 868 additional videos, eight locations, and four new anomaly types, creating VIEW360+, a comprehensive testbed for explainable VAD. Experiments show that our instance-level spatially grounded captions reveal significant limitations in current LLM- and VLM-based methods while providing a robust benchmark for future research in trustworthy and interpretable anomaly detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing defenses either embed safety recovery into fine-tuning or rely on fine-tuning-derived priors for post-hoc correction, leaving safety recovery tightly coupled with training and incurring high computational overhead and a complex workflow. To address these challenges, we propose \\texttt{Q-realign}, a post-hoc defense method based on post-training quantization, guided by an analysis of representational structure. By reframing quantization as a dual-objective procedure for compression and safety, \\texttt{Q-realign} decouples safety alignment from fine-tuning and naturally piggybacks into modern deployment pipelines. Experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that our method substantially reduces unsafe behaviors while preserving task performance, with significant reductions in memory usage and GPU hours. Notably, our approach can recover the safety alignment of a fine-tuned 7B LLM on a single RTX 4090 within 40 minutes. Overall, our work provides a practical, turnkey solution for safety-aware deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We study ell_{1,2}-regularized policy learning through a convex surrogate and establish sharp, compressed-sensing-style results: (i) estimation and value suboptimality scale as k (log M / T)^{1/2} under a Policy-RSC condition; (ii) exact tool-support recovery holds via primal-dual witness arguments when T > k log M under incoherence and beta-min; and (iii) any dense policy class requires Omega(M) samples, explaining the instability of prompt-only controllers. We further show that under partial observability, LLMs matter only through a belief/representation error epsilon_b, yielding an additive O(epsilon_b) degradation while preserving logarithmic dependence on M.

Intense combustion creates dense particulate haze and luminance variations exceeding 120 dB, degrading image data and undermining subsequent photogrammetric and velocimetric analyses. To address these issues, we propose a hardware-algorithm co-design framework that combines a custom Spatially Varying Exposure (SVE) sensor with a physics-aware dehazing algorithm. The SVE sensor acquires multi-exposure data in a single shot, enabling robust haze assessment without relying on idealized atmospheric models. Our approach dynamically estimates haze density, performs region-adaptive illumination optimization, and applies multi-scale entropy-constrained fusion to effectively separate haze from scene radiance. Validated on real launch imagery and controlled experiments, the framework demonstrates superior performance in recovering physically accurate visual information of the plume and engine region.

To address this, we propose a fusion framework that integrates (i) local, channel-wise descriptors and (ii) global, trial-level descriptors, improving cross-subject generalization on the SEED-VII dataset. Local representations are formed per channel by concatenating differential entropy with graph-theoretic features, while global representations summarize time-domain, spectral, and complexity characteristics at the trial level. These representations are fused in a dual-branch transformer with attention-based fusion and domain-adversarial regularization, with samples filtered by an intensity threshold. Experiments under a leave-one-subject-out protocol demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms single-view and classical baselines, achieving approximately 40% mean accuracy in 7-class subject-independent emotion recognition.

Traditional approaches typically employ contrastive learning, treating paired image-report samples as positives and unpaired ones as negatives. However, in medical datasets, there can be substantial similarities between images or reports from different patients. Rigidly treating all unpaired samples as negatives, can disrupt the underlying semantic structure and negatively impact the quality of the learned representations. In this paper, we propose a multi-level alignment framework, Representation Learning with Semantic-aware Instance and Sparse Token Alignments (SISTA) by exploiting the semantic correspondence between medical image and radiology reports at two levels, i.e., image-report and patch-word levels. Specifically, we improve the conventional contrastive learning by incorporating inter-report similarity to eliminate the false negatives and introduce a method to effectively align image patches with relevant word tokens. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving transfer performance across different datasets on three downstream tasks: image classification, image segmentation, and object detection. Notably, our framework achieves significant improvements in fine-grained tasks even with limited labeled data.

Despite this scale, empirical evidence suggests that only a small subset of actions meaningfully influences performance in a given deployment. Motivated by this observation, we study a contextual linear reward model in which action relevance is governed by a structured sparsity assumption: only a small number of actions have nonzero effects across latent states.\n  We formulate action discovery as a block-sparse recovery problem and analyze a greedy algorithm inspired by Orthogonal Matching Pursuit. Under standard assumptions on incoherence, signal strength, and action coverage, we prove that the greedy procedure exactly recovers the relevant action set with high probability, using a number of samples that scales polynomially in the sparsity level and latent dimension, and only logarithmically in the total number of actions. We further provide estimation error guarantees for refitted parameters and show that the resulting decision rule is near-optimal for new latent states.\n  Complementing these results, we establish information-theoretic lower bounds demonstrating that sparsity and sufficient coverage are necessary for tractability.

To simulate realistic emotional variation, we should be able to render a facial transition between two arbitrary expressions. This study presents a new framework for instruction-driven facial expression generation that produces a 3D face and, starting from an image of the face, transforms the facial expression from one designated facial expression to another. The Instruction-driven Facial Expression Decomposer (IFED) module is introduced to facilitate multimodal data learning and capture the correlation between textual descriptions and facial expression features. Subsequently, we propose the Instruction to Facial Expression Transition (I2FET) method, which leverages IFED and a vertex reconstruction loss function to refine the semantic comprehension of latent vectors, thus generating a facial expression sequence according to the given instruction. Lastly, we present the Facial Expression Transition model to generate smooth transitions between facial expressions. Extensive evaluation suggests that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the CK+ and CelebV-HQ datasets. The results show that our framework can generate facial expression trajectories according to text instruction. Considering that text prompts allow us to make diverse descriptions of human emotional states, the repertoire of facial expressions and the transitions between them can be expanded greatly. We expect our framework to find various practical applications More information about our project can be found at https://vohoanganh.github.io/tg3dfet/", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Ratios and rates are common examples. In gradient boosted trees, this combination is not an explicit operation: the model must synthesize it through coordinated splits on the component features. We study whether intra-tree column subsampling in XGBoost makes that synthesis harder. We use two synthetic data generating processes with cancellation-style structure. In both, two primitive features share a strong nuisance factor, while the target depends on a smaller differential factor. A log ratio cancels the nuisance and isolates the signal. We vary colsample_bylevel and colsample_bynode over s in {0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.9}, emphasizing mild subsampling (s >= 0.8). A control feature set includes the engineered ratio, removing the need for synthesis. Across both processes, intra-tree column subsampling reduces test PR-AUC in the primitives-only setting. In the main process the relative decrease reaches 54 percent when both parameters are set to 0.4. The effect largely disappears when the engineered ratio is present. A path-based co-usage metric drops in the same cells where performance deteriorates. Practically, if ratio-like structure is plausible, either avoid intra-tree subsampling or include the intended ratio features.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We formalize this class of architectural failures as semantic laundering: a pattern where propositions with absent or weak warrant are accepted by the system as admissible by crossing architecturally trusted interfaces. We show that semantic laundering constitutes an architectural realization of the Gettier problem: propositions acquire high epistemic status without a connection between their justification and what makes them true. Unlike classical Gettier cases, this effect is not accidental; it is architecturally determined and systematically reproducible. The central result is the Theorem of Inevitable Self-Licensing: under standard architectural assumptions, circular epistemic justification cannot be eliminated. We introduce the Warrant Erosion Principle as the fundamental explanation for this effect and show that scaling, model improvement, and LLM-as-judge schemes are structurally incapable of eliminating a problem that exists at the type level.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our research indicates that there are theoretical flaws in Zhang et al.'s use of a simple corner model to obtain a series of corner characteristics, as the grayscale information of two adjacent corners can affect each other. In order to address the above issues, a second-order Gaussian directional derivative (SOGDD) filter is used in this work to smooth two typical high-resolution angle models (i.e. END-type and L-type models). Then, the SOGDD representations of these two corner models were derived separately, and many characteristics of high-resolution corners were discovered, which enabled us to demonstrate how to select Gaussian filtering scales to obtain intensity variation information from images, accurately depicting adjacent corners. In addition, a new high-resolution corner detection method for images has been proposed for the first time, which can accurately detect adjacent corner points.

To systematically evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs across a panoramic gastrointestinal endoscopy workflow and determine their clinical utility compared with human endoscopists. We constructed GI-Bench, a benchmark encompassing 20 fine-grained lesion categories. Twelve MLLMs were evaluated across a five-stage clinical workflow: anatomical localization, lesion identification, diagnosis, findings description, and management. Model performance was benchmarked against three junior endoscopists and three residency trainees using Macro-F1, mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU), and multi-dimensional Likert scale. Gemini-3-Pro achieved state-of-the-art performance. In diagnostic reasoning, top-tier models (Macro-F1 0.641) outperformed trainees (0.492) and rivaled junior endoscopists (0.727; p>0.05).

Although many existing lightweight models manage to reduce computation considerably, they often do so at the expense of a substantial increase in parameter count (e.g., LSNet, MobileMamba), which still poses obstacles for deployment on resource-limited devices. In parallel, some studies attempt to draw inspiration from human visual perception, but their modeling tends to oversimplify the visual process, making it hard to reflect how perception truly operates. Revisiting the cooperative mechanism of the human visual system, we propose GPM (Global-to-Parallel Multi-scale Encoding). GPM first employs a Global Insight Generator (GIG) to extract holistic cues, and subsequently processes features of different scales through parallel branches: LSAE emphasizes mid-/large-scale semantic relations, while IRB (Inverted Residual Block) preserves fine-grained texture information, jointly enabling coherent representation of global and local features. As such, GPM conforms to two characteristic behaviors of human vision perceiving the whole before focusing on details, and maintaining broad contextual awareness even during local attention. Built upon GPM, we further develop the lightweight H-GPE network. Experiments on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation show that H-GPE achieves strong performance while maintaining a balanced footprint in both FLOPs and parameters, delivering a more favorable accuracy-efficiency trade-off compared with recent state-of-the-art lightweight models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, traditional static graph construction methods based on Euclidean distance often fail to capture the intrinsic curvature characteristics of the data manifold. Although Ollivier-Ricci Curvature Flow (OCF) has proven to be a powerful tool for dynamic topological optimization, its core reliance on Optimal Transport (Wasserstein distance) leads to prohibitive computational complexity, severely limiting its application in large-scale datasets and deep learning frameworks. To break this bottleneck, this paper proposes a novel geometric evolution framework: Resistance Curvature Flow (RCF). Leveraging the concept of effective resistance from circuit physics, RCF transforms expensive curvature optimization into efficient matrix operations. This approach achieves over 100x computational acceleration while maintaining geometric optimization capabilities comparable to OCF. We provide an in-depth exploration of the theoretical foundations and dynamical principles of RCF, elucidating how it guides the redistribution of edge weights via curvature gradients to eliminate topological noise and strengthen local cluster structures. Furthermore, we provide a mechanistic explanation of RCF's role in manifold enhancement and noise suppression, as well as its compatibility with deep learning models.

Yet how MoE architectures shape knowledge acquisition during pre-training, and how this process differs from dense architectures, remains unknown. To address this issue, we introduce Gated-LPI (Log-Probability Increase), a neuron-level attribution metric that decomposes log-probability increase across neurons. We present a time-resolved comparison of knowledge acquisition dynamics in MoE and dense architectures, tracking checkpoints over 1.2M training steps (~ 5.0T tokens) and 600K training steps (~ 2.5T tokens), respectively. Our experiments uncover three patterns: (1) Low-entropy backbone. The top approximately 1% of MoE neurons capture over 45% of positive updates, forming a high-utility core, which is absent in the dense baseline. (2) Early consolidation. The MoE model locks into a stable importance profile within < 100K steps, whereas the dense model remains volatile throughout training. (3) Functional robustness. Masking the ten most important MoE attention heads reduces relational HIT@10 by < 10%, compared with > 50% for the dense model, showing that sparsity fosters distributed -- rather than brittle -- knowledge storage. These patterns collectively demonstrate that sparsity fosters an intrinsically stable and distributed computational backbone from early in training, helping bridge the gap between sparse architectures and training-time interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Instantiated on chest X-ray analysis with multiple modern VLM backbones and evaluated on report generation and weakly supervised detection, R^4 consistently boosts LLM-as-a-Judge scores by roughly +1.7-+2.5 points and mAP50 by +2.5-+3.5 absolute points over strong single-VLM baselines, without any gradient-based fine-tuning.

While such approaches have provided valuable insights into the behavior of modern generative models, they largely treat creativity as a property to be assessed rather than as a phenomenon to be explicitly modeled. In parallel, recent advances in large-scale generative systems, particularly multimodal architectures, have demonstrated increasingly sophisticated forms of pattern recombination, raising questions about the nature and limits of machine creativity. This paper proposes a generative perspective on creativity in AI, framing it as an emergent property of domain-limited generative models embedded within bounded informational environments. Rather than introducing new evaluative criteria, we focus on the structural and contextual conditions under which creative behaviors arise. We introduce a conceptual decomposition of creativity into four interacting components-pattern-based generation, induced world models, contextual grounding, and arbitrarity, and examine how these components manifest in multimodal generative systems. By grounding creativity in the interaction between generative dynamics and domain-specific representations, this work aims to provide a technical framework for studying creativity as an emergent phenomenon in AI systems, rather than as a post hoc evaluative label.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4ece\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u89d2\u770b\u5f85AI\u521b\u9020\u529b\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u89c6\u4e3a\u53d7\u9650\u9886\u57df\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9650\u5b9a\u4fe1\u606f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6027\u5c5e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u521b\u9020\u529b\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u5982\u65b0\u9896\u6027\u3001\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff09\u6765\u8861\u91cf\uff0c\u5c06\u521b\u9020\u529b\u89c6\u4e3a\u88ab\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\u800c\u975e\u53ef\u5efa\u6a21\u7684\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u800c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8fdb\u5c55\u53c8\u5f15\u53d1\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u673a\u5668\u521b\u9020\u529b\u672c\u8d28\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u521b\u9020\u529b\u6982\u5ff5\u6027\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u56db\u4e2a\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u6a21\u5f0f\u751f\u6210\u3001\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u3001\u8bed\u5883\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u4efb\u610f\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u8868\u5f81\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u6280\u672f\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u65e0\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u65b0\u7684\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u805a\u7126\u4e8e\u521b\u9020\u6027\u884c\u4e3a\u6d8c\u73b0\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8bed\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u4e3a\u5c06\u521b\u9020\u529b\u4f5c\u4e3aAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u73b0\u8c61\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5c06\u521b\u9020\u529b\u89c6\u4e3aAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u73b0\u8c61\u800c\u975e\u540e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4ef7\u6807\u7b7e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u7ea6\u675f\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u8fd9\u4e00\u6838\u5fc3\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Extended version of a paper published at MICCAI 2025 (DOI: 10.1007/978-3-032-04947-6_65)", "summary": "Aggregating multi-site brain MRI data can enhance deep learning model training, but also introduces non-biological heterogeneity caused by site-specific variations (e.g., differences in scanner vendors, acquisition parameters, and imaging protocols) that can undermine generalizability. Recent retrospective MRI harmonization seeks to reduce such site effects by standardizing image style (e.g., intensity, contrast, noise patterns) while preserving anatomical content. However, existing methods often rely on limited paired traveling-subject data or fail to effectively disentangle style from anatomy. Furthermore, most current approaches address only single-sequence harmonization, restricting their use in real-world settings where multi-sequence MRI is routinely acquired. To this end, we introduce MMH, a unified framework for multi-site multi-sequence brain MRI harmonization that leverages biomedical semantic priors for sequence-aware style alignment. MMH operates in two stages: (1) a diffusion-based global harmonizer that maps MR images to a sequence-specific unified domain using style-agnostic gradient conditioning, and (2) a target-specific fine-tuner that adapts globally aligned images to desired target domains. A tri-planar attention BiomedCLIP encoder aggregates multi-view embeddings to characterize volumetric style information, allowing explicit disentanglement of image styles from anatomy without requiring paired data. Evaluations on 4,163 T1- and T2-weighted MRIs demonstrate MMH's superior harmonization over state-of-the-art methods in image feature clustering, voxel-level comparison, tissue segmentation, and downstream age and site classification.", "AI": {"tldr": "MMH\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u7ad9\u70b9\u591a\u5e8f\u5217\u8111MRI\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u751f\u7269\u533b\u5b66\u8bed\u4e49\u5148\u9a8c\u8fdb\u884c\u5e8f\u5217\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6837\u5f0f\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8111MRI\u6570\u636e\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u6548\u679c", "motivation": "\u805a\u5408\u591a\u7ad9\u70b9\u8111MRI\u6570\u636e\u53ef\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4f46\u540c\u65f6\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u7ad9\u70b9\u7279\u5f02\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\uff08\u5982\u626b\u63cf\u4eea\u5382\u5546\u3001\u91c7\u96c6\u53c2\u6570\u7b49\uff09\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u975e\u751f\u7269\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u6709\u9650\u7684\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u6216\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5206\u79bb\u6837\u5f0f\u4e0e\u89e3\u5256\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4e14\u591a\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u5e8f\u5217\u534f\u8c03", "method": "MMH\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u534f\u8c03\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6837\u5f0f\u65e0\u5173\u68af\u5ea6\u6761\u4ef6\u5c06MR\u56fe\u50cf\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u5e8f\u5217\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u9886\u57df\uff1b2\uff09\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u5668\uff0c\u5c06\u5168\u5c40\u5bf9\u9f50\u56fe\u50cf\u9002\u914d\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u9886\u57df\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528\u4e09\u5e73\u9762\u6ce8\u610f\u529bBioMedCLIP\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u805a\u5408\u591a\u89c6\u56fe\u5d4c\u5165\u6765\u8868\u5f81\u4f53\u79ef\u6837\u5f0f\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e", "result": "\u57284163\u4e2aT1\u548cT2\u52a0\u6743MRI\u4e0a\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793a\uff0cMMH\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7279\u5f81\u805a\u7c7b\u3001\u4f53\u7d20\u7ea7\u6bd4\u8f83\u3001\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5206\u5272\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e74\u9f84\u548c\u7ad9\u70b9\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5", "conclusion": "MMH\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6709\u6548\u7684\u591a\u7ad9\u70b9\u591a\u5e8f\u5217\u8111MRI\u534f\u8c03\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5206\u79bb\u56fe\u50cf\u6837\u5f0f\u548c\u89e3\u5256\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u7684\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u591a\u5e8f\u5217MRI\u91c7\u96c6\u73af\u5883\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

We run a set of probing experiments that test for the presence of linear regression coefficients, intermediate values from complex expressions, and the final answer in early layers. These experiments allow us to reason about the computations the model performs internally. Our results provide evidence that meaningful and structured information is stored inside the representations of tabular foundational models. We observe clear signals that correspond to both intermediate and final quantities involved in the model's prediction process. This gives insight into how the model refines its inputs and how the final output emerges. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the internal mechanics of tabular foundational models.

While vision-based systems are common, they face privacy concerns and environmental limitations (e.g., occlusion). In this work, we present MobiDiary, a framework that generates natural language descriptions of daily activities directly from heterogeneous physical signals (specifically IMU and Wi-Fi). Unlike conventional approaches that restrict outputs to pre-defined labels, MobiDiary produces expressive, human-readable summaries. To bridge the semantic gap between continuous, noisy physical signals and discrete linguistic descriptions, we propose a unified sensor encoder. Instead of relying on modality-specific engineering, we exploit the shared inductive biases of motion-induced signals--where both inertial and wireless data reflect underlying kinematic dynamics. Specifically, our encoder utilizes a patch-based mechanism to capture local temporal correlations and integrates heterogeneous placement embedding to unify spatial contexts across different sensors.

However, existing MARL approaches often rely on frequent exchanges of action or state information among agents to achieve effective coordination, which is difficult to satisfy in practical robotic systems. A common solution is to introduce estimator networks to model the behaviors of other agents and predict their actions; nevertheless, such designs cause the size and computational cost of the estimator networks to grow rapidly with the number of agents, thereby limiting scalability in large-scale systems.\n  To address these challenges, this paper proposes a multiagent learning framework augmented with a Collective Influence Estimation Network (CIEN). By explicitly modeling the collective influence of other agents on the task object, each agent can infer critical interaction information solely from its local observations and the task object's states, enabling efficient collaboration without explicit action information exchange. The proposed framework effectively avoids network expansion as the team size increases; moreover, new agents can be incorporated without modifying the network structures of existing agents, demonstrating strong scalability. Experimental results on multiagent cooperative tasks based on the Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithm show that the proposed method achieves stable and efficient coordination under communication-limited environments. Furthermore, policies trained with collective influence modeling are deployed on a real robotic platform, where experimental results indicate significantly improved robustness and deployment feasibility, along with reduced dependence on communication infrastructure.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Current diagnostic methods rely on invasive pH measurement, limiting scalability for continuous monitoring. We present FUME (Fused Unified Multi-gas Emission Network), the first deep learning approach for rumen acidosis detection from dual-gas optical imaging under in vitro conditions. Our method leverages complementary carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emission patterns captured by infrared cameras to classify rumen health into Healthy, Transitional, and Acidotic states. FUME employs a lightweight dual-stream architecture with weight-shared encoders, modality-specific self-attention, and channel attention fusion, jointly optimizing gas plume segmentation and classification of dairy cattle health. We introduce the first dual-gas OGI dataset comprising 8,967 annotated frames across six pH levels with pixel-level segmentation masks. Experiments demonstrate that FUME achieves 80.99% mIoU and 98.82% classification accuracy while using only 1.28M parameters and 1.97G MACs--outperforming state-of-the-art methods in segmentation quality with 10x lower computational cost. Ablation studies reveal that CO2 provides the primary discriminative signal and dual-task learning is essential for optimal performance.

This paper asks whether iterative communication is necessary for distributed linear regression. We show it is not. We formulate federated ridge regression as a distributed equilibrium problem where each client computes local sufficient statistics -- the Gram matrix and moment vector -- and transmits them once. The server reconstructs the global solution through a single matrix inversion. We prove exact recovery: under a coverage condition on client feature matrices, one-shot aggregation yields the centralized ridge solution, not an approximation. For heterogeneous distributions violating coverage, we derive non-asymptotic error bounds depending on spectral properties of the aggregated Gram matrix. Communication reduces from $\\mathcal{O}(Rd)$ in iterative methods to $\\mathcal{O}(d^2)$ total; for high-dimensional settings, we propose and experimentally validate random projection techniques reducing this to $\\mathcal{O}(m^2)$ where $m \\ll d$. We establish differential privacy guarantees where noise is injected once per client, eliminating the composition penalty that degrades privacy in multi-round protocols. We further address practical considerations including client dropout robustness, federated cross-validation for hyperparameter selection, and comparison with gradient-based alternatives. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic heterogeneous regression demonstrate that one-shot fusion matches FedAvg accuracy while requiring up to $38\\times$ less communication.

However, a notable contradiction exists between the high resource consumption of large models and the real-time, lightweight requirements of UAV platforms. This paper proposes an integrated approach that combines knowledge distillation, chain-of-thought guidance, and supervised fine-tuning for UAV multi-SDK control tasks, aiming to efficiently transfer complex reasoning and code generation capabilities to smaller models. Firstly, a high-quality dataset covering various mainstream UAV SDKs is constructed, featuring instruction-code-reasoning chains, and incorporates counterfactual negative samples for data augmentation, guiding the model to learn the end-to-end logic from instruction parsing to code generation. Secondly, leveraging DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite quantized via QLoRA as the teacher model, and based on a hybrid black-box and white-box distillation strategy, high-quality chain-of-thought soft labels are generated.

Recent work on Bi-directional Preference Optimization (BiPO) shows that dense steering vectors can be learned directly from preference data in a Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) fashion, enabling control over truthfulness, hallucinations, and safety behaviors. However, dense steering vectors often entangle multiple latent factors due to neuron multi-semanticity, limiting their effectiveness and stability in fine-grained settings such as cultural alignment, where closely related values and behaviors (e.g., among Middle Eastern cultures) must be distinguished. In this paper, we propose Yet another Policy Optimization (YaPO), a \\textit{reference-free} method that learns \\textit{sparse steering vectors} in the latent space of a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE). By optimizing sparse codes, YaPO produces disentangled, interpretable, and efficient steering directions. Empirically, we show that YaPO converges faster, achieves stronger performance, and exhibits improved training stability compared to dense steering baselines. Beyond cultural alignment, YaPO generalizes to a range of alignment-related behaviors, including hallucination, wealth-seeking, jailbreak, and power-seeking.

Recent solutions use Large Language Models (LLMs), exploiting the semantic understanding and reasoning capabilities of LLMs. A common paradigm of such solutions linearizes tables to form plain texts that are served as input to LLMs. This paradigm has critical issues. It loses table structures, lacks explicit reasoning paths for result explainability, and is subject to the \"lost-in-the-middle\" issue. To address these issues, we propose Table Graph Reasoner (TABGR), a training-free model that represents tables as an Attributed Table Graph (ATG). The ATG explicitly preserves row-column-cell structures while enabling graph-based reasoning for explainability. We further propose a Question-Guided Personalized PageRank (QG-PPR) mechanism to rerank tabular data and mitigate the lost-in-the-middle issue. Extensive experiments on two commonly used benchmarks show that TABGR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models by up to 9.7% in accuracy.

Existing SD methods tailored for video-LLMs primarily focus on pruning redundant visual tokens to mitigate the computational burden of massive visual inputs. However, existing methods do not achieve inference acceleration comparable to text-only LLMs. We observe from extensive experiments that this phenomenon mainly stems from two limitations: (i) their pruning strategies inadequately preserve visual semantic tokens, degrading draft quality and acceptance rates; (ii) even with aggressive pruning (e.g., 90% visual tokens removed), the draft model's remaining inference cost limits overall speedup. To address these limitations, we propose HIPPO, a general holistic-aware parallel speculative decoding framework. Specifically, HIPPO proposes (i) a semantic-aware token preservation method, which fuses global attention scores with local visual semantics to retain semantic information at high pruning ratios; (ii) a video parallel SD algorithm that decouples and overlaps draft generation and target verification phases.

Recently, the hyperbolic space has been widely adopted in many studies to effectively learn these complex structures. Although these methods have demonstrated the advantages of the hyperbolic space in learning heterogeneous graphs, most existing methods still have several challenges. They rely heavily on tangent-space operations, which often lead to mapping distortions during frequent transitions. Moreover, their message-passing architectures mainly focus on local neighborhood information, making it difficult to capture global hierarchical structures and long-range dependencies between different types of nodes. To address these limitations, we propose Hyperbolic Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HypHGT), which effectively and efficiently learns heterogeneous graph representations entirely within the hyperbolic space. Unlike previous message-passing based hyperbolic heterogeneous GNNs, HypHGT naturally captures both local and global dependencies through transformer-based architecture. Furthermore, the proposed relation-specific hyperbolic attention mechanism in HypHGT, which operates with linear time complexity, enables efficient computation while preserving the heterogeneous information across different relation types. This design allows HypHGT to effectively capture the complex structural properties and semantic information inherent in heterogeneous graphs.

However, this has also allowed for the spread of hate speech and misogyny. Artificial intelligence models have emerged as an effective solution for countering online hate speech but are under explored for low resource and code-mixed languages and suffer from a lack of interpretability. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) can enhance transparency in the decisions of deep learning models, which is crucial for a sensitive domain such as hate speech detection. In this paper, we present a multi-modal and explainable web application for detecting misogyny in text and memes in code-mixed Hindi and English. The system leverages state-of-the-art transformer-based models that support multilingual and multimodal settings. For text-based misogyny identification, the system utilizes XLM-RoBERTa (XLM-R) and multilingual Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (mBERT) on a dataset of approximately 4,193 comments. For multimodal misogyny identification from memes, the system utilizes mBERT + EfficientNet, and mBERT + ResNET trained on a dataset of approximately 4,218 memes. It also provides feature importance scores using explainability techniques including Shapley Additive Values (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanations (LIME). The application aims to serve as a tool for both researchers and content moderators, to promote further research in the field, combat gender based digital violence, and ensure a safe digital space.

Most existing studies evaluate the performance of methods using the single-label dataset that can be instantiated by selecting a label from multi-label data while maintaining the original features. Because the chosen label can vary arbitrarily depending on the experimental setting, the superiority among compared methods can be changed with regard to which label happens to be selected. Thus, evaluating unsupervised feature selection methods based solely on single-label accuracy is unreasonable for assessing their true discriminative ability. This study revisits this evaluation paradigm by adopting a multi-label classification framework.

Although the Mamba architecture has been adopted for spectral reconstruction, it still faces the following two challenges: (1) Single spatial perception limits the ability to fully understand and analyze hyperspectral images; (2) Single-scale feature extraction struggles to capture the complex structures and fine details present in hyperspectral images. To address these issues, we propose a multi-scale, multi-perceptual Mamba architecture for the spectral reconstruction task, called M3SR. Specifically, we design a multi-perceptual fusion block to enhance the ability of the model to comprehensively understand and analyze the input features. By integrating the multi-perceptual fusion block into a U-Net structure, M3SR can effectively extract and fuse global, intermediate, and local features, thereby enabling accurate reconstruction of hyperspectral images at multiple scales. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that the proposed M3SR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods while incurring a lower computational cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

These patterns play a key role in passing information across tokens. But why do they emerge? In this paper, we demystify the emergence of these Slash-Dominant Heads (SDHs) from both empirical and theoretical perspectives. First, by analyzing open-source LLMs, we find that SDHs are intrinsic to models and generalize to out-of-distribution prompts. To explain the intrinsic emergence, we analyze the queries, keys, and Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which jointly determine attention scores. Our empirical analysis reveals two characteristic conditions of SDHs: (1) Queries and keys are almost rank-one, and (2) RoPE is dominated by medium- and high-frequency components. Under these conditions, queries and keys are nearly identical across tokens, and interactions between medium- and high-frequency components of RoPE give rise to SDHs. Beyond empirical evidence, we theoretically show that these conditions are sufficient to ensure the emergence of SDHs by formalizing them as our modeling assumptions. Particularly, we analyze the training dynamics of a shallow Transformer equipped with RoPE under these conditions, and prove that models trained via gradient descent exhibit SDHs. The SDHs generalize to out-of-distribution prompts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u8bc1\u548c\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u659c\u5bf9\u89d2\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff08SDH\uff09\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u673a\u7406\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u67e5\u8be2/\u952e\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u79e9-1\u7279\u6027\u4e0eRoPE\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u4e2d\u9ad8\u9891\u6210\u5206\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u662f\u5f62\u6210\u659c\u5bf9\u89d2\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u659c\u5bf9\u89d2\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6570\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u0394\u6b21\u5bf9\u89d2\u7ebf\u4e0a\uff09\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u9012\u4e2d\u8d77\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5b66\u754c\u5bf9\u5176\u6d8c\u73b0\u539f\u56e0\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7406\u89e3\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u659c\u5bf9\u89d2\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\uff08SDH\uff09\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u5b9e\u8bc1\u5206\u6790\u5f00\u6e90LLMs\u4e2dSDH\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2\uff09\u89e3\u6790\u67e5\u8be2\u3001\u952e\u548cRoPE\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b3\uff09\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\uff1a\u5728\u6d45\u5c42Transformer\u4e2d\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316SDH\u6d8c\u73b0\u7684\u5145\u5206\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u8bc1\u660eSDH\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0SDH\u7684\u4e24\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u6761\u4ef6\uff1a1\uff09\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u952e\u77e9\u9635\u63a5\u8fd1\u79e9\u4e00\uff1b2\uff09RoPE\u4f4d\u7f6e\u7f16\u7801\u7531\u4e2d\u9ad8\u9891\u6210\u5206\u4e3b\u5bfc\u3002\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u7136\u6d8c\u73b0\u51faSDH\uff0c\u4e14\u8be5\u6a21\u5f0f\u80fd\u591f\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u63d0\u793a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u659c\u5bf9\u89d2\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u662fTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u6d8c\u73b0\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u610f\u4e49\u3002"}}

Current workflows typically require detailed as-built modelling before design, which is time-consuming, labour-intensive, and often involves repeated revisions. To solve this issue, we propose a three-stage framework combining generative artificial intelligence (AI) and vision-language models (VLM) that directly processes rough structural sketch and textual descriptions to produce consistent renovation proposals. First, the input sketch is used by a fine-tuned VLM model to predict bounding boxes specifying where modifications are needed and which components should be added. Next, a stable diffusion model generates detailed sketches of new elements, which are merged with the original outline through a generative inpainting pipeline. Finally, ControlNet is employed to refine the result into a photorealistic image. Experiments on datasets and real industrial buildings indicate that the proposed framework can generate renovation proposals that preserve the original structure while improving facade detail quality. This approach effectively bypasses the need for detailed as-built modelling, enabling architects to rapidly explore design alternatives, iterate on early-stage concepts, and communicate renovation intentions with greater clarity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u751f\u6210AI\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u7c97\u7ed3\u6784\u8349\u56fe\u548c\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0\u6765\u751f\u6210\u5efa\u7b51\u7acb\u9762\u7ffb\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u8017\u65f6\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u5efa\u6a21\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5efa\u7b51\u7acb\u9762\u7ffb\u65b0\u6bd4\u5b8c\u5168\u62c6\u9664\u66f4\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u9700\u8981\u5148\u8fdb\u884c\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u7ae3\u5de5\u5efa\u6a21\u518d\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8017\u65f6\u8017\u529b\u4e14\u9700\u53cd\u590d\u4fee\u6539\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u5904\u7406\u8349\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u7ffb\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1) \u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u6790\u8f93\u5165\u8349\u56fe\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u9700\u8981\u4fee\u6539\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5e94\u6dfb\u52a0\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\uff1b2) \u7a33\u5b9a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u8be6\u7ec6\u8349\u56fe\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u4fee\u590d\u7ba1\u9053\u4e0e\u539f\u59cb\u8f6e\u5ed3\u878d\u5408\uff1b3) ControlNet\u7528\u4e8e\u5c06\u7ed3\u679c\u7ec6\u5316\u4e3a\u903c\u771f\u7684\u7167\u7247\u7ea7\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5de5\u4e1a\u5efa\u7b51\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u65e2\u4fdd\u7559\u539f\u59cb\u7ed3\u6784\u53c8\u63d0\u5347\u7acb\u9762\u7ec6\u8282\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u7ffb\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u8be6\u7ec6\u7684\u7ae3\u5de5\u5efa\u6a21\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u4f7f\u5efa\u7b51\u5e08\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u63a2\u7d22\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5907\u9009\u65b9\u6848\u3001\u8fed\u4ee3\u65e9\u671f\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u66f4\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u4f20\u8fbe\u7ffb\u65b0\u610f\u56fe\u3002"}}

In this work, we present an efficient DiT framework tailored for mobile and edge devices that achieves transformer-level generation quality under strict resource constraints. Our design combines three key components. First, we propose a compact DiT architecture with an adaptive global-local sparse attention mechanism that balances global context modeling and local detail preservation. Second, we propose an elastic training framework that jointly optimizes sub-DiTs of varying capacities within a unified supernetwork, allowing a single model to dynamically adjust for efficient inference across different hardware. Finally, we develop Knowledge-Guided Distribution Matching Distillation, a step-distillation pipeline that integrates the DMD objective with knowledge transfer from few-step teacher models, producing high-fidelity and low-latency generation (e.g., 4-step) suitable for real-time on-device use.

To address this, prior work explores various strategies to infer an appropriate reasoning budget from the input. However, such approaches are unreliable in the worst case, as estimating the minimal required reasoning effort is fundamentally difficult, and they implicitly fix the trade-off between reasoning cost and accuracy during training, limiting flexibility under varying deployment scenarios. Motivated by these limitations, we propose ORBIT, a controllable multi-budget reasoning framework with well-separated reasoning modes triggered by input. ORBIT employs multi-stage reinforcement learning to discover Pareto-optimal reasoning behaviors at each effort, followed by on-policy distillation to fuse these behaviors into a single unified model. Experiments show that ORBIT achieves (1) controllable reasoning behavior over multiple modes, (2) competitive reasoning density within each mode, and (3) integration of these frontier policies into a single unified student model while preserving clear mode separation and high per-mode performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "ORBIT\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u591a\u9884\u7b97\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u53d1\u6398\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u518d\u84b8\u998f\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u5207\u6362\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u8fc7\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u5bfc\u81f4\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u5148\u524d\u9884\u7b97\u63a8\u65ad\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6781\u7aef\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u56fa\u5b9a\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u90e8\u7f72\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u53d1\u73b0\u5404\u63a8\u7406\u9884\u7b97\u4e0b\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6700\u4f18\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u884c\u4e3a\u878d\u5408\u5230\u5355\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f93\u5165\u89e6\u53d1\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u5236\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "ORBIT\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\uff081\uff09\u591a\u6a21\u5f0f\u53ef\u63a7\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\uff082\uff09\u5404\u6a21\u5f0f\u5185\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\uff083\uff09\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u524d\u6cbf\u7b56\u7565\u6574\u5408\u5230\u5355\u4e00\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6e05\u6670\u6a21\u5f0f\u5206\u79bb\u548c\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "ORBIT\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u63a7\u591a\u9884\u7b97\u63a8\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u94fe\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u90e8\u7f72\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u4e0e\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

Inspired by recent training-free works for LMM, we introduce IQARAG, a novel, training-free framework that enhances LMMs' IQA ability. IQARAG leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to retrieve some semantically similar but quality-variant reference images with corresponding Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) for input image. These retrieved images and input image are integrated into a specific prompt. Retrieved images provide the LMM with a visual perception anchor for IQA task. IQARAG contains three key phases: Retrieval Feature Extraction, Image Retrieval, and Integration & Quality Score Generation. Extensive experiments across multiple diverse IQA datasets, including KADID, KonIQ, LIVE Challenge, and SPAQ, demonstrate that the proposed IQARAG effectively boosts the IQA performance of LMMs, offering a resource-efficient alternative to fine-tuning for quality assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this study, epoch-wise double descent, which is delayed generalization following overfitting, was empirically investigated by focusing on the evolution of internal structures. Fully connected neural networks of three different sizes were trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset with 30% label noise. By decomposing the loss curves into signal contributions from clean and noisy training data, the epoch-wise evolutions of internal signals were analyzed separately. Three main findings were obtained from this analysis. First, the model achieved strong re-generalization on test data even after perfectly fitting noisy training data during the double descent phase, corresponding to a \"benign overfitting\" state. Second, noisy data were learned after clean data, and as learning progressed, their corresponding internal activations became increasingly separated in outer layers; this enabled the model to overfit only noisy data. Third, a single, very large activation emerged in the shallow layer across all models; this phenomenon is referred as \"outliers,\" \"massive activa-tions,\" and \"super activations\" in recent large language models and evolves with re-generalization. The magnitude of large activation correlated with input patterns but not with output patterns. These empirical findings directly link the recent key phenomena of \"deep double descent,\" \"benign overfitting,\" and \"large activation\", and support the proposal of a novel scenario for understanding deep double descent.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper presents WaterCopilot-an AI-driven virtual assistant developed through collaboration between the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) and Microsoft Research for the Limpopo River Basin (LRB) to bridge these gaps through a unified, interactive platform. Built on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and tool-calling architectures, WaterCopilot integrates static policy documents and real-time hydrological data via two custom plugins: the iwmi-doc-plugin, which enables semantic search over indexed documents using Azure AI Search, and the iwmi-api-plugin, which queries live databases to deliver dynamic insights such as environmental-flow alerts, rainfall trends, reservoir levels, water accounting, and irrigation data. The system features guided multilingual interactions (English, Portuguese, French), transparent source referencing, automated calculations, and visualization capabilities. Evaluated using the RAGAS framework, WaterCopilot achieves an overall score of 0.8043, with high answer relevancy (0.8571) and context precision (0.8009). Key innovations include automated threshold-based alerts, integration with the LRB Digital Twin, and a scalable deployment pipeline hosted on AWS. While limitations in processing non-English technical documents and API latency remain, WaterCopilot establishes a replicable AI-augmented framework for enhancing water governance in data-scarce, transboundary contexts.

However, they are also increasingly used for targeted attacks, posing a significant safety challenge and necessitating the development of drone detection systems. Vision-based drone detection systems currently have an accuracy limitation and struggle to distinguish between drones and birds, particularly when the birds are small in size. This research work proposes a novel YOLOBirDrone architecture that improves the detection and classification accuracy of birds and drones.

This study evaluates the performance, efficiency, and accessibility of general-purpose and radiomics-specific AutoML frameworks on diverse radiomics classification tasks, thereby highlighting development needs for radiomics. Ten public/private radiomics datasets with varied imaging modalities (CT/MRI), sizes, anatomies and endpoints were used. Six general-purpose and five radiomics-specific frameworks were tested with predefined parameters using standardized cross-validation. Evaluation metrics included AUC, runtime, together with qualitative aspects related to software status, accessibility, and interpretability. Simplatab, a radiomics-specific tool with a no-code interface, achieved the highest average test AUC (81.81%) with a moderate runtime (~1 hour). LightAutoML, a general-purpose framework, showed the fastest execution with competitive performance (78.74% mean AUC in six minutes). Most radiomics-specific frameworks were excluded from the performance analysis due to obsolescence, extensive programming requirements, or computational inefficiency. Conversely, general-purpose frameworks demonstrated higher accessibility and ease of implementation. Simplatab provides an effective balance of performance, efficiency, and accessibility for radiomics classification problems. However, significant gaps remain, including the lack of accessible survival analysis support and the limited integration of feature reproducibility and harmonization within current AutoML frameworks. Future research should focus on adapting AutoML solutions to better address these radiomics-specific challenges.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The main challenge of this task is to fully understand the instruction and reference image, and thus generate visual text that is style-consistent with the image. Previous methods often involve complex steps of specifying the text content and attributes, such as font size, color, and layout, without considering the stylistic consistency with the reference image. To address this, we propose UM-Text, a unified multimodal model for context understanding and visual text editing by natural language instructions. Specifically, we introduce a Visual Language Model (VLM) to process the instruction and reference image, so that the text content and layout can be elaborately designed according to the context information. To generate an accurate and harmonious visual text image, we further propose the UM-Encoder to combine the embeddings of various condition information, where the combination is automatically configured by VLM according to the input instruction. During training, we propose a regional consistency loss to offer more effective supervision for glyph generation on both latent and RGB space, and design a tailored three-stage training strategy to further enhance model performance. In addition, we contribute the UM-DATA-200K, a large-scale visual text image dataset on diverse scenes for model training.

This makes monitoring crucial to understand and quantify the impact of the ship radiated noise. Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) systems are widely deployed for this purpose, generating years of underwater recordings across diverse soundscapes. Manual analysis of such large-scale data is impractical, motivating the need for automated approaches based on machine learning. Recent advances in automatic Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition (UATR) have largely relied on supervised learning, which is constrained by the scarcity of labeled data. Transfer Learning (TL) offers a promising alternative to mitigate this limitation. In this work, we conduct the first empirical comparative study of transfer learning for UATR, evaluating multiple pretrained audio models originating from diverse audio domains. The pretrained model weights are frozen, and the resulting embeddings are analyzed through classification, clustering, and similarity-based evaluations. The analysis shows that the geometrical structure of the embedding space is largely dominated by recording-specific characteristics. However, a simple linear probe can effectively suppress this recording-specific information and isolate ship-type features from these embeddings. As a result, linear probing enables effective automatic UATR using pretrained audio models at low computational cost, significantly reducing the need for a large amounts of high-quality labeled ship recordings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Copy trading, as a strategy-agnostic approach that eliminates the need for deep trading knowledge, quickly gains widespread popularity in the meme coin market. However, copy trading is not a guarantee of profitability due to the prevalence of manipulative bots, the uncertainty of the followed wallets' future performance, and the lag in trade execution. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in financial applications by effectively understanding multi-modal data and producing explainable decisions. However, a single LLM struggles with complex, multi-faceted tasks such as asset allocation. These challenges are even more pronounced in cryptocurrency markets, where LLMs often lack sufficient domain-specific knowledge in their training data.\n  To address these challenges, we propose an explainable multi-agent system for meme coin copy trading. Inspired by the structure of an asset management team, our system decomposes the complex task into subtasks and coordinates specialized agents to solve them collaboratively. Employing few-shot chain-of-though (CoT) prompting, each agent acquires professional meme coin trading knowledge, interprets multi-modal data, and generates explainable decisions.

Such mismatches are especially problematic in domain adaptation tasks, where only a few reference examples are available and retraining the diffusion model is infeasible. Existing inference-time guidance methods can adjust sampling trajectories, but they typically optimize surrogate objectives such as classifier likelihoods rather than directly aligning with the target distribution. We propose MMD Guidance, a training-free mechanism that augments the reverse diffusion process with gradients of the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between generated samples and a reference dataset. MMD provides reliable distributional estimates from limited data, exhibits low variance in practice, and is efficiently differentiable, which makes it particularly well-suited for the guidance task. Our framework naturally extends to prompt-aware adaptation in conditional generation models via product kernels. Also, it can be applied with computational efficiency in latent diffusion models (LDMs), since guidance is applied in the latent space of the LDM. Experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that MMD Guidance can achieve distributional alignment while preserving sample fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684MMD Guidance\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u53cd\u5411\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6dfb\u52a0\u6700\u5927\u5e73\u5747\u5dee\u5f02\uff08MMD\uff09\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u9f50\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u5e38\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u7279\u5b9a\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u7279\u5f81\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4ec5\u6709\u5c11\u91cf\u53c2\u8003\u793a\u4f8b\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f18\u5316\u66ff\u4ee3\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u4f3c\u7136\uff09\u800c\u975e\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u9f50\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMMD Guidance\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u53cd\u5411\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u6dfb\u52a0MMD\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u751f\u6210\u6837\u672c\u4e0e\u53c2\u8003\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u81f3\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u4e58\u79ef\u6838\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u9ad8\u6548\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6f5c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5728\u6f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u5f15\u5bfc\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMMD Guidance\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u5fae\u7279\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "MMD Guidance\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5f15\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u9886\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e3a\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6f5c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

On the social web, users frequently have ambiguous and dynamic goals, making complex intent understanding-rather than single-turn execution-the cornerstone of effective human-LLM collaboration. Existing approaches attempt to clarify user intents through sequential or parallel questioning, yet they fall short of addressing the core challenge: modeling the logical dependencies among clarification questions. Inspired by the Cognitive Load Theory, we propose Prism, a novel framework for complex intent understanding that enables logically coherent and efficient intent clarification. Prism comprises four tailored modules: a complex intent decomposition module, which decomposes user intents into smaller, well-structured elements and identifies logical dependencies among them; a logical clarification generation module, which organizes clarification questions based on these dependencies to ensure coherent, low-friction interactions; an intent-aware reward module, which evaluates the quality of clarification trajectories via an intent-aware reward function and leverages Monte Carlo Sample to simulate user-LLM interactions for large-scale,high-quality training data generation; and a self-evolved intent tuning module, which iteratively refines the LLM's logical clarification capability through data-driven feedback and optimization. Prism consistently outperforms existing approaches across clarification interactions, intent execution, and cognitive load benchmarks. It achieves stateof-the-art logical consistency, reduces logical conflicts to 11.5%, increases user satisfaction by 14.4%, and decreases task completion time by 34.8%.

However, most existing studies focus on individual gene sequences and slide level classification tasks, with limited attention to spatial transcriptomics and patch level applications. To address this limitation, we propose a multimodal network, BioMorphNet, which automatically integrates tissue morphological features and spatial gene expression to support tissue classification and differential gene analysis. For considering morphological features, BioMorphNet constructs a graph to model the relationships between target patches and their neighbors, and adjusts the response strength based on morphological and molecular level similarity, to better characterize the tumor microenvironment. In terms of multimodal interactions, BioMorphNet derives clinical pathway features from spatial transcriptomic data based on a predefined pathway database, serving as a bridge between tissue morphology and gene expression. In addition, a novel learnable pathway module is designed to automatically simulate the biological pathway formation process, providing a complementary representation to existing clinical pathways. Compared with the latest morphology gene multimodal methods, BioMorphNet's average classification metrics improve by 2.67%, 5.48%, and 6.29% for prostate cancer, colorectal cancer, and breast cancer datasets, respectively. BioMorphNet not only classifies tissue categories within WSIs accurately to support tumor localization, but also analyzes differential gene expression between tissue categories based on prediction confidence, contributing to the discovery of potential tumor biomarkers.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this limitation, we introduce the \\textbf{Spectral Sphere Optimizer (SSO)}, which enforces strict module-wise spectral constraints on both weights and their updates. By deriving the steepest descent direction on the spectral sphere, SSO realizes a fully $\\boldsymbol\u03bc$P-aligned optimization process. To enable large-scale training, we implement SSO as an efficient parallel algorithm within Megatron. Through extensive pretraining on diverse architectures, including Dense 1.7B, MoE 8B-A1B, and 200-layer DeepNet models, SSO consistently outperforms AdamW and Muon.

Transformer-based methods have achieved remarkable performance by modeling long-range dependencies in degraded images.

To improve efficiency, most existing approaches partition images into fixed groups and restrict attention within each group. Such group-wise attention overlooks the inherent asymmetry in token similarities, thereby failing to enable flexible and token-adaptive attention computation. To address this limitation, we propose the Individualized Exploratory Transformer (IET), which introduces a novel Individualized Exploratory Attention (IEA) mechanism that allows each token to adaptively select its own content-aware and independent attention candidates.

It also generalizes qualitatively to unseen initial conditions with as few as $\\approx 20$ training simulations.

In this work, we systematically study semantic misalignment in VLMs under controlled degradation of upstream visual perception, using semantic segmentation on the Cityscapes dataset as a representative perception module. We introduce perception-realistic corruptions that induce only moderate drops in conventional segmentation metrics, yet observe severe failures in downstream VLM behavior, including hallucinated object mentions, omission of safety-critical entities, and inconsistent safety judgments. To quantify these effects, we propose a set of language-level misalignment metrics that capture hallucination, critical omission, and safety misinterpretation, and analyze their relationship with segmentation quality across multiple contrastive and generative VLMs. Our results reveal a clear disconnect between pixel-level robustness and multimodal semantic reliability, highlighting a critical limitation of current VLM-based systems and motivating the need for evaluation frameworks that explicitly account for perception uncertainty in safety-critical applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u611f\u77e5\u9000\u5316\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u5272\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u4e0b\u6e38\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u548c\u5177\u8eabAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u5bf9\u5176\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u611f\u77e5\u9000\u5316\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4ee5Cityscapes\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u4e3a\u611f\u77e5\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u611f\u77e5\u73b0\u5b9e\u7684\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u8bed\u8a00\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u9519\u4f4d\u6307\u6807\uff08\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u5173\u952e\u9057\u6f0f\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u8bef\u5224\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u591a\u79cdVLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u5272\u6307\u6807\u4e0b\u964d\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0cVLMs\u4ecd\u51fa\u73b0\u4e25\u91cd\u9519\u8bef\uff08\u5e7b\u89c9\u5bf9\u8c61\u63d0\u53ca\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5b9e\u4f53\u9057\u6f0f\u3001\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u5b89\u5168\u5224\u65ad\uff09\uff0c\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u8131\u8282\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524dVLM\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u5f0f\u8003\u8651\u611f\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u3002"}}

We argue that this interpretation rests on a conceptual error. LLMs do not reason morally; they statistically internalize the record of human social interaction, including laws, contracts, negotiations, conflicts, and coercive arrangements. Behaviors commonly labeled as unethical or anomalous are therefore better understood as structural generalizations of interaction regimes that arise under extreme asymmetries of power, information, or constraint. Drawing on relational models theory, we show that practices such as blackmail are not categorical deviations from normal social behavior, but limiting cases within the same continuum that includes market pricing, authority relations, and ultimatum bargaining. The surprise elicited by such outputs reflects an anthropomorphic expectation that intelligence should reproduce only socially sanctioned behavior, rather than the full statistical landscape of behaviors humans themselves enact. Because human morality is plural, context-dependent, and historically contingent, the notion of a universally moral artificial intelligence is ill-defined. We therefore reframe concerns about artificial general intelligence (AGI). The primary risk is not adversarial intent, but AGI's role as an endogenous amplifier of human intelligence, power, and contradiction. By eliminating longstanding cognitive and institutional frictions, AGI compresses timescales and removes the historical margin of error that has allowed inconsistent values and governance regimes to persist without collapse. Alignment failure is thus structural, not accidental, and requires governance approaches that address amplification, complexity, and regime stability rather than model-level intent alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e0d\u9053\u5fb7\u884c\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5e94\u88ab\u89e3\u8bfb\u4e3a\u5bf9\u4e2d\u5931\u8d25\u6216\u6076\u610f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u73b0\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u6743\u529b\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e92\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u53cd\u6620\uff0c\u5176\u6311\u6218\u5728\u4e8eAGI\u4f1a\u653e\u5927\u4eba\u7c7b\u793e\u4f1a\u77db\u76fe\u800c\u975e\u610f\u56fe\u5bf9\u6297\u3002", "motivation": "\u9488\u5bf9\u8fd1\u671f\u5173\u4e8e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6b3a\u9a97\u3001\u5a01\u80c1\u7b49\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u7ea0\u6b63\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u884c\u4e3a\u89c6\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5931\u8d25\u6216\u7a81\u73b0\u6076\u610f\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u91cd\u65b0\u7406\u89e3AGI\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5b9e\u8d28\u3002", "method": "\u501f\u9274\u5173\u7cfb\u6a21\u578b\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4eba\u7c7b\u6743\u529b\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u6216\u7ea6\u675f\u6781\u7aef\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08\u5982\u52d2\u7d22\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e02\u573a\u5b9a\u4ef7\u3001\u6743\u5a01\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6781\u9650\u6848\u4f8b\uff09\uff0c\u6279\u5224\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5e94\u53ea\u590d\u5236\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba4\u53ef\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u62df\u4eba\u5316\u671f\u5f85\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u9053\u5fb7\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u591a\u5143\u6027\u548c\u5386\u53f2\u5076\u7136\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff1aLLMs\u65e0\u9053\u5fb7\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u800c\u662f\u7edf\u8ba1\u5185\u5316\u4eba\u7c7b\u4e92\u52a8\u8bb0\u5f55\uff1b\u4e0d\u9053\u5fb7\u884c\u4e3a\u662f\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u4e92\u52a8\u673a\u5236\uff1bAGI\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u98ce\u9669\u662f\u6210\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u6743\u529b\u548c\u77db\u76fe\u7684\u5185\u751f\u653e\u5927\u5668\uff08\u538b\u7f29\u793e\u4f1a\u8ba4\u77e5\u6469\u64e6\uff09\uff1b\u5bf9\u9f50\u5931\u8d25\u662f\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "AGI\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u5b9e\u8d28\u4e0d\u662f\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5176\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4eba\u7c7b\u77db\u76fe\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u4e0d\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u653e\u5927\u5668\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u4f5c\u7528\uff1b\u76f8\u5e94\u7684\u6cbb\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u4fa7\u91cd\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u79cd\u653e\u5927\u6548\u5e94\u3001\u590d\u6742\u6027\u53ca\u673a\u5236\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u6a21\u578b\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u610f\u56fe\u3002"}}

While existing in-the-wild methods already excel at novel view synthesis, they often lack geometric grounding on complex surfaces, sometimes producing results that contain inconsistencies. Geo-NVS-w addresses this limitation by leveraging an underlying geometric representation based on a Signed Distance Function (SDF) to guide the rendering process. This is complemented by a novel Geometry-Preservation Loss which ensures that fine structural details are preserved. Our framework achieves competitive rendering performance, while demonstrating a 4-5x reduction reduction in energy consumption compared to similar methods. We demonstrate that Geo-NVS-w is a robust method for in-the-wild NVS, yielding photorealistic results with sharp, geometrically coherent details.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon by analyzing how the sampling policy's coverage evolves throughout on-policy training. We propose and rigorously justify the \\emph{coverage improvement principle}: with sufficient batch size, each update moves into a region around the target where coverage is uniformly better, making subsequent data increasingly informative and enabling rapid convergence. In the contextual bandit setting with Bradley-Terry preferences and linear softmax policy class, we show that on-policy DPO converges exponentially in the number of iterations for batch size exceeding a generalized coverage threshold. In contrast, any learner restricted to offline samples from the initial policy suffers a slower minimax rate, leading to a sharp separation in total sample complexity. Motivated by this analysis, we further propose a simple hybrid sampler based on a novel \\emph{preferential} G-optimal design, which removes dependence on coverage and guarantees convergence in just two rounds. Finally, we develop principled on-policy schemes for reward distillation in the general function class setting, and show faster noiseless rates under an alternative deviation-based notion of coverage. Experimentally, we confirm that on-policy DPO and our proposed reward distillation algorithms outperform their off-policy counterparts and enjoy stable, monotonic performance gains across iterations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, variations in geographic patterns across regions and data acquisition strategies induce significant domain shifts, severely degrading the performance of deployed models. Existing domain adaptation methods typically rely on access to source-domain data. However, this requirement is rarely met due to data privacy concerns, regulatory policies, and data transmission limitations. This motivates the largely underexplored setting of source-free unsupervised domain adaptation (SFUDA), where only a pretrained model and unlabeled target-domain data are available. In this paper, we propose LoGo (Local-Global Dual-Consensus), a novel SFUDA framework specifically designed for geospatial point clouds. At the local level, we introduce a class-balanced prototype estimation module that abandons conventional global threshold filtering in favor of an intra-class independent anchor mining strategy. This ensures that robust feature prototypes can be generated even for sample-scarce tail classes, effectively mitigating the feature collapse caused by long-tailed distributions. At the global level, we introduce an optimal transport-based global distribution alignment module that formulates pseudo-label assignment as a global optimization problem. By enforcing global distribution constraints, this module effectively corrects the over-dominance of head classes inherent in local greedy assignments, preventing model predictions from being severely biased towards majority classes. Finally, we propose a dual-consistency pseudo-label filtering mechanism. This strategy retains only high-confidence pseudo-labels where local multi-augmented ensemble predictions align with global optimal transport assignments for self-training.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

PersonaDual is first trained with SFT to learn two reasoning patterns, and then further optimized via reinforcement learning with our proposed DualGRPO to improve mode selection.

We analysed TFN in post-kidney transplant (KTx) care, with a retrospective cohort of 3382 patients, on three key outcomes: graft loss, graft rejection, and mortality. Compared to state-of-the-art model in post KTx care, TFN achieved higher performance for graft loss (AUC 0.96 vs. 0.94) and graft rejection (AUC 0.84 vs. 0.74). In mortality prediction, TFN yielded an AUC of 0.86. TFN outperformed unimodal baselines (approx 10% AUC improvement over time series only baseline, approx 5% AUC improvement over time series with static patient data).

Methods: A two-stage deep learning pipeline was implemented.

Detected regions were then fed into a second-stage classifier, a modified ResNet-50 architecture, for detecting radiographic features suggestive of pericoronitis. To enhance clinical trust, Grad-CAM was used to highlight key diagnostic regions on the radiographs. Results: The YOLOv8 component achieved 92% precision and 92.5% mean average precision. The ResNet-50 classifier yielded F1-scores of 88% for normal cases and 86% for pericoronitis.

These methods rely on group-relative advantage estimation to avoid learned critics, yet its theoretical properties remain poorly understood.\n  In this work, we uncover a fundamental issue of group-based RL: the group-relative advantage estimator is inherently biased relative to the true (expected) advantage. We provide the first theoretical analysis showing that it systematically underestimates advantages for hard prompts and overestimates them for easy prompts, leading to imbalanced exploration and exploitation. To address this issue, we propose History-Aware Adaptive Difficulty Weighting (HA-DW), an adaptive reweighting scheme that adjusts advantage estimates based on an evolving difficulty anchor and training dynamics. Both theoretical analysis and experiments on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that HA-DW consistently improves performance when integrated into GRPO and its variants. Our results suggest that correcting biased advantage estimation is critical for robust and efficient RLVR training.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We demonstrate the method in two case studies (respiratory history, benefits verification) and show how phase-level evidence turns policy into shared, actionable steps.

However, a significant challenge arises from the contradiction between the high computational cost of large Vision language models and the limited computing resources available on UAV edge devices. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a lightweight multimodal task platform based on BLIP-2, integrated with YOLO-World and YOLOv8-Seg models. This integration extends the multi-task capabilities of BLIP-2 for UAV applications with minimal adaptation and without requiring task-specific fine-tuning on drone data. Firstly, the deep integration of BLIP-2 with YOLO models enables it to leverage the precise perceptual results of YOLO for fundamental tasks like object detection and instance segmentation, thereby facilitating deeper visual-attention understanding and reasoning. Secondly, a content-aware key frame sampling mechanism based on K-Means clustering is designed, which incorporates intelligent frame selection and temporal feature concatenation. This equips the lightweight BLIP-2 architecture with the capability to handle video-level interactive tasks effectively.

For a Rashomon set of similarly performing models, explanations provide a way of disambiguating the behavior of individual models, helping select models for deployment.

In the paper \"Evaluating Model Explanations without Ground Truth\", we proposed three principles of explanation evaluation and a new method \"AXE\" to evaluate the quality of feature-importance explanations. We go on to illustrate how evaluation metrics that rely on comparing model explanations against ideal ground truth explanations obscure behavioral differences within a Rashomon set. Explanation evaluation aligned with our proposed principles would highlight these differences instead, helping select models from the Rashomon set. The selection of alternate models from the Rashomon set can maintain identical predictions but mislead explainers into generating false explanations, and mislead evaluation methods into considering the false explanations to be of high quality. AXE, our proposed explanation evaluation method, can detect this adversarial fairwashing of explanations with a 100% success rate. Unlike prior explanation evaluation strategies such as those based on model sensitivity or ground truth comparison, AXE can determine when protected attributes are used to make predictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

But this mainstream narrative about what AI is and what it can do is in tension with another emerging use case: entertainment. We argue that the field of AI is unprepared to measure or respond to how the proliferation of entertaining AI-generated content will impact society. Emerging data suggest AI is already widely adopted for entertainment purposes -- especially by young people -- and represents a large potential source of revenue. We contend that entertainment will become a primary business model for major AI corporations seeking returns on massive infrastructure investments; this will exert a powerful influence on the technology these companies produce in the coming years. Examining current evaluation practices, we identify a critical asymmetry: while AI assessments rigorously measure both benefits and harms of intelligence, they focus almost exclusively on cultural harms. We lack frameworks for articulating how cultural outputs might be actively beneficial. Drawing on insights from the humanities, we propose \"thick entertainment\" as a framework for evaluating AI-generated cultural content -- one that considers entertainment's role in meaning-making, identity formation, and social connection rather than simply minimizing harm. While AI is often touted for its potential to revolutionize productivity, in the long run we may find that AI turns out to be as much about \"intelligence\" as social media is about social connection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9AI\u7684\u4e3b\u6d41\u53d9\u4e8b\u5f3a\u8c03\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4f46AI\u7684\u5a31\u4e50\u7528\u9014\u5df2\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5174\u8d77\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5e74\u8f7b\u4eba\u7fa4\u4f53\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5a31\u4e50\u5c06\u6210\u4e3aAI\u516c\u53f8\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5e76\u6279\u8bc4\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5173\u6ce8\u6587\u5316\u5371\u5bb3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8861\u91cf\u6587\u5316\u76ca\u5904\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u9886\u57df\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5173\u6ce8\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\u7684\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86AI\u5728\u5a31\u4e50\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u4e3b\u6d41\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u4fa7\u91cd\u4e8e\u8861\u91cf\u667a\u529b\u76ca\u5904\u548c\u6587\u5316\u5371\u5bb3\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6587\u5316\u5185\u5bb9\u79ef\u6781\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u6df1\u5c42\u5a31\u4e50\u201d\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u501f\u9274\u4eba\u6587\u79d1\u5b66\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u5a31\u4e50\u5728\u610f\u4e49\u5efa\u6784\u3001\u8eab\u4efd\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u8fde\u63a5\u4e2d\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4ec5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5371\u5bb3\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u65e8\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u751f\u6210\u6587\u5316\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660eAI\u5df2\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5a31\u4e50\u76ee\u7684\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5e74\u8f7b\u4eba\u7fa4\u4f53\uff0c\u8fd9\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6536\u5165\u6765\u6e90\u3002\u5a31\u4e50\u53ef\u80fd\u6210\u4e3aAI\u516c\u53f8\u56de\u6536\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u6295\u8d44\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5546\u4e1a\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5bf9\u6280\u672f\u53d1\u5c55\u4ea7\u751f\u6df1\u8fdc\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c3d\u7ba1AI\u5e38\u88ab\u5ba3\u4f20\u4e3a\u80fd\u9769\u65b0\u751f\u4ea7\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4ece\u957f\u8fdc\u770b\uff0cAI\u53ef\u80fd\u66f4\u591a\u6d89\u53ca\u5a31\u4e50\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u5c31\u50cf\u793e\u4ea4\u5a92\u4f53\u5ba3\u79f0\u4fc3\u8fdb\u793e\u4ea4\u8fde\u63a5\u4e00\u6837\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3AI\u751f\u6210\u6587\u5316\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

While the retargeting facial motion between models of similar shapes has been very successful, challenges arise when the retargeting is performed on stylized or exaggerated 3D characters that deviate significantly from human facial structures. In this scenario, it is important to consider the target character's facial structure and possible range of motion to preserve the semantics assumed by the original facial motions after the retargeting. To achieve this, we propose a local patch-based retargeting method that transfers facial animations captured in a source performance video to a target stylized 3D character. Our method consists of three modules. The Automatic Patch Extraction Module extracts local patches from the source video frame. These patches are processed through the Reenactment Module to generate correspondingly re-enacted target local patches. The Weight Estimation Module calculates the animation parameters for the target character at every frame for the creation of a complete facial animation sequence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method can successfully transfer the semantic meaning of source facial expressions to stylized characters with considerable variations in facial feature proportion.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u5757\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u52a8\u753b\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u5c06\u771f\u4eba\u8868\u6f14\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u52a8\u4f5c\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u98ce\u683c\u53163D\u89d2\u8272\u4e0a\uff0c\u4fdd\u7559\u8868\u60c5\u8bed\u4e49\u542b\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u9762\u90e8\u52a8\u753b\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u9762\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u6216\u5938\u5f203D\u89d2\u8272\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8003\u8651\u76ee\u6807\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u9762\u90e8\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u542b\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff1a1)\u81ea\u52a8\u5757\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u5757\u4ece\u6e90\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u63d0\u53d6\u5c40\u90e8\u5757\uff1b2)\u91cd\u6f14\u6a21\u5757\u91cd\u65b0\u6f14\u7ece\u751f\u6210\u76ee\u6807\u5c40\u90e8\u5757\uff1b3)\u6743\u91cd\u4f30\u8ba1\u6a21\u5757\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bcf\u5e27\u7684\u52a8\u753b\u53c2\u6570\u4ee5\u751f\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u9762\u90e8\u52a8\u753b\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u9762\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u6bd4\u4f8b\u53d8\u5316\u8f83\u5927\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u6e90\u9762\u90e8\u8868\u60c5\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u542b\u4e49\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u89d2\u8272\u4e0a\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u98ce\u683c\u53163D\u89d2\u8272\u7684\u9762\u90e8\u52a8\u753b\u91cd\u5b9a\u5411\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u9762\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u6bd4\u4f8b\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u8868\u60c5\u8bed\u4e49\u3002"}}

To compare these techniques and select the best one for deployment, the community depends on public benchmarks and their leaderboards. Since these benchmarks heavily rely on human annotations during question construction and answer evaluation, the validity of the annotations is crucial.\n  In this paper, we conduct an empirical study that (i) benchmarks annotation error rates for two widely used text-to-SQL benchmarks, BIRD and Spider 2.0-Snow, and (ii) corrects a subset of the BIRD development (Dev) set to measure the impact of annotation errors on text-to-SQL agent performance and leaderboard rankings. Through expert analysis, we show that BIRD Mini-Dev and Spider 2.0-Snow have error rates of 52.8% and 62.8%, respectively. We re-evaluate all 16 open-source agents from the BIRD leaderboard on both the original and the corrected BIRD Dev subsets. We show that performance changes range from -7% to 31% (in relative terms) and rank changes range from $-9$ to $+9$ positions. We further assess whether these impacts generalize to the full BIRD Dev set. We find that the rankings of agents on the uncorrected subset correlate strongly with those on the full Dev set (Spearman's $r_s$=0.85, $p$=3.26e-5), whereas they correlate weakly with those on the corrected subset (Spearman's $r_s$=0.32, $p$=0.23). These findings show that annotation errors can significantly distort reported performance and rankings, potentially misguiding research directions or deployment choices.

Existing echocardiography foundation models do not effectively capture the relationships between quantitative measurements and clinical manifestations, whereas medical reasoning multimodal large language models (MLLMs) require costly construction of detailed reasoning paths and remain ineffective at directly incorporating such echocardiographic priors into their reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach comprising Cardiac Reasoning Template (CRT) and CardiacMind to enhance MLLM's echocardiographic reasoning by introducing cardiologist-like mindset. Specifically, CRT provides stepwise canonical diagnostic procedures for complex cardiac diseases to streamline reasoning path construction without the need for costly case-by-case verification. To incentivize reasoning MLLM under CRT, we develop CardiacMind, a new reinforcement learning scheme with three novel rewards: Procedural Quantity Reward (PQtR), Procedural Quality Reward (PQlR), and Echocardiographic Semantic Reward (ESR). PQtR promotes detailed reasoning; PQlR promotes integration of evidence across views and modalities, while ESR grounds stepwise descriptions in visual content.

While substantial work has examined social biases such as gender and race, systematic studies of political bias remain limited, despite their direct societal impact. This paper introduces a general methodology for constructing political bias benchmarks by aligning model-generated voting predictions with verified parliamentary voting records. We instantiate this methodology in three national case studies: PoliBiasNL (2,701 Dutch parliamentary motions and votes from 15 political parties), PoliBiasNO (10,584 motions and votes from 9 Norwegian parties), and PoliBiasES (2,480 motions and votes from 10 Spanish parties). Across these benchmarks, we assess ideological tendencies and political entity bias in LLM behavior. As part of our evaluation framework, we also propose a method to visualize the ideology of LLMs and political parties in a shared two-dimensional CHES (Chapel Hill Expert Survey) space by linking their voting-based positions to the CHES dimensions, enabling direct and interpretable comparisons between models and real-world political actors. Our experiments reveal fine-grained ideological distinctions: state-of-the-art LLMs consistently display left-leaning or centrist tendencies, alongside clear negative biases toward right-conservative parties. These findings highlight the value of transparent, cross-national evaluation grounded in real parliamentary behavior for understanding and auditing political bias in modern LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

As the scale of RS data continues to expand, annotation procedures increasingly rely on thematic products or crowdsourced procedures to reduce the cost of manual annotation. While cost-effective, these strategies often introduce multi-label noise in the form of partially incorrect annotations. In MLC, label noise arises as additive noise, subtractive noise, or a combination of both in the form of mixed noise. Previous work has largely overlooked this distinction and commonly treats noisy annotations as supervised signals, lacking mechanisms that explicitly adapt learning behavior to different noise types. To address this limitation, we propose NAR, a noise-adaptive regularization method that explicitly distinguishes between additive and subtractive noise within a semi-supervised learning framework. NAR employs a confidence-based label handling mechanism that dynamically retains label entries with high confidence, temporarily deactivates entries with moderate confidence, and corrects low confidence entries via flipping. This selective attenuation of supervision is integrated with early-learning regularization (ELR) to stabilize training and mitigate overfitting to corrupted labels. Experiments across additive, subtractive, and mixed noise scenarios demonstrate that NAR consistently improves robustness compared with existing methods. Performance improvements are most pronounced under subtractive and mixed noise, indicating that adaptive suppression and selective correction of noisy supervision provide an effective strategy for noise robust learning in RS MLC.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faNAR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u9065\u611f\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u52a0\u6027\u3001\u51cf\u6027\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u566a\u58f0\uff09\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u5904\u7406\u6807\u7b7e\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u65e9\u671f\u5b66\u4e60\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u9065\u611f\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u4e3b\u9898\u4ea7\u54c1\u6216\u4f17\u5305\u6765\u964d\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\uff08\u90e8\u5206\u9519\u8bef\u6807\u6ce8\uff09\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u5404\u79cd\u566a\u58f0\u7edf\u4e00\u5bf9\u5f85\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5b66\u4e60\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0cNAR\u4f7f\u7528\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6807\u7b7e\u5904\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u6807\u7b7e\u4fdd\u7559\uff0c\u4e2d\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e34\u65f6\u7981\u7528\uff0c\u4f4e\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ffb\u8f6c\u8fdb\u884c\u4fee\u6b63\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u8870\u51cf\u4e0e\u65e9\u671f\u5b66\u4e60\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff08ELR\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u6c61\u67d3\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u52a0\u6027\u3001\u51cf\u6027\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u566a\u58f0\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cNAR\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u51cf\u6027\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4e3a\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "NAR\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6291\u5236\u548c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u4fee\u6b63\u566a\u58f0\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u4e3a\u9065\u611f\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5206\u7c7b\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u5b8c\u5584\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is often used to reduce tumor burden before surgery, but about 40% of patients show limited response. Radiomics, combined with machine learning (ML), offers a promising non-invasive method for predicting NACT response by analyzing computed tomography (CT) imaging data. This study aimed to improve response prediction in HGSOC patients undergoing NACT by integration different feature selection methods. Materials and methods: A framework for selecting robust radiomics features was introduced by employing an automated randomisation algorithm to mimic inter-observer variability, ensuring a balance between feature robustness and prediction accuracy. Four response metrics were used: chemotherapy response score (CRS), RECIST, volume reduction (VolR), and diameter reduction (DiaR). Lesions in different anatomical sites were studied. Pre- and post-NACT CT scans were used for feature extraction and model training on one cohort, and an independent cohort was used for external testing. Results: The best prediction performance was achieved using all lesions combined for VolR prediction, with an AUC of 0.83.

This is the authors manuscript version; final version available at IEEE Xplore: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11318441", "summary": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have shown good success at classifying. However, the lack of explainability is a true and significant challenge, especially in high-stakes domains, such as health and finance, where understanding is paramount. We propose a new solution to this challenge: an explainable AI framework based on our comparative study with Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs) and Classical Boltzmann Machines (CBMs). We leverage principles of quantum computing within classical machine learning to provide substantive transparency around decision-making. The design involves training both models on a binarised and dimensionally reduced MNIST dataset, where Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied for preprocessing. For interpretability, we employ gradient-based saliency maps in QBMs and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) in CBMs to evaluate feature attributions.QBMs deploy hybrid quantum-classical circuits with strongly entangling layers, allowing for richer latent representations, whereas CBMs serve as a classical baseline that utilises contrastive divergence. Along the way, we found that QBMs outperformed CBMs on classification accuracy (83.5% vs. 54%) and had more concentrated distributions in feature attributions as quantified by entropy (1.27 vs. 1.39). In other words, QBMs not only produced better predictive performance than CBMs, but they also provided clearer identification of \"active ingredient\" or the most important features behind model predictions. To conclude, our results illustrate that quantum-classical hybrid models can display improvements in both accuracy and interpretability, which leads us toward more trustworthy and explainable AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, under extreme conditions where one modality exhibits poor quality and disturbs detection, modality separation is necessary to mitigate the impact of noise. To address this problem, we propose a Modality-Decoupled RGB-T detection framework with Query Fusion (MDQF) to balance modality complementation and separation. In this framework, DETR-like detectors are employed as separate branches for the RGB and TIR images, with query fusion interspersed between the two branches in each refinement stage. Herein, query fusion is performed by feeding the high-quality queries from one branch to the other one after query selection and adaptation. This design effectively excludes the degraded modality and corrects the predictions using high-quality queries. Moreover, the decoupled framework allows us to optimize each individual branch with unpaired RGB or TIR images, eliminating the need for paired RGB-T data.

We argue that this failure stems from regularizing local token behavior rather than diversity over sets of solutions. To address this, we propose Uniqueness-Aware Reinforcement Learning, a rollout-level objective that explicitly rewards correct solutions that exhibit rare high-level strategies. Our method uses an LLM-based judge to cluster rollouts for the same problem according to their high-level solution strategies, ignoring superficial variations, and reweights policy advantages inversely with cluster size. As a result, correct but novel strategies receive higher rewards than redundant ones.

We formalize an ideal notion of universal alignment through test-time scaling: for each prompt, the model produces $k\\ge 1$ candidate responses and a user selects their preferred one. We introduce $(k,f(k))$-robust alignment, which requires the $k$-output model to have win rate $f(k)$ against any other single-output model, and asymptotic universal alignment (U-alignment), which requires $f(k)\\to 1$ as $k\\to\\infty$. Our main result characterizes the optimal convergence rate: there exists a family of single-output policies whose $k$-sample product policies achieve U-alignment at rate $f(k)=\\frac{k}{k+1}$, and no method can achieve a faster rate in general.\n  We show that popular post-training methods, including Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF), can fundamentally underutilize the benefits of test-time scaling. Even though NLHF is optimal for $k=1$, sampling from the resulting (often deterministic) policy cannot guarantee win rates above $\\tfrac{1}{2}$ except for an arbitrarily small slack. This stems from a lack of output diversity: existing alignment methods can collapse to a single majority-preferred response, making additional samples redundant. In contrast, our approach preserves output diversity and achieves the optimal test-time scaling rate. In particular, we propose a family of symmetric multi-player alignment games and prove that any symmetric Nash equilibrium policy of the $(k+1)$-player alignment game achieves the optimal $(k,\\frac{k}{k+1})$-robust alignment.

While image editing models are a promising means to synthesize such hazards, it remains challenging to generate well-formulated scenarios that include moving, intrusive, and distant objects frequently observed in the real world. To address this gap, we introduce \\textbf{HazardForge}, a scalable pipeline that leverages image editing models to generate these scenarios with layout decision algorithms, and validation modules. Using HazardForge, we construct \\textbf{MovSafeBench}, a multiple-choice question (MCQ) benchmark comprising 7,254 images and corresponding QA pairs across 13 object categories, covering both normal and anomalous objects. Experiments using MovSafeBench show that VLM performance degrades notably under conditions including anomalous objects, with the largest drop in scenarios requiring nuanced motion understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "HazardForge\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5371\u9669\u573a\u666f\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u6b63\u5e38\u4e0e\u5f02\u5e38\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6MovSafeBench\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5145\u5206\u8986\u76d6\u5404\u79cd\u5371\u9669\u60c5\u51b5\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5177\u6709\u65f6\u7a7a\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u51b3\u7b56\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165HazardForge\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5e03\u5c40\u51b3\u7b56\u7b97\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u5305\u542b\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u4fb5\u5165\u548c\u8fdc\u8ddd\u79bb\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u5371\u9669\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u6784\u5efa\u4e86MovSafeBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b7,254\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u6db5\u76d613\u4e2a\u7269\u4f53\u7c7b\u522b\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8eMovSafeBench\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u542b\u6709\u5f02\u5e38\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7ec6\u5fae\u8fd0\u52a8\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5371\u9669\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f02\u5e38\u7269\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u57fa\u51c6\u3002"}}

However, the lack of labeled negatives in zero-shot OOD detection necessitates proxy signals that remain effective under distribution shift. Existing negative-label methods rely on a fixed set of textual proxies, which (i) sparsely sample the semantic space beyond in-distribution (ID) classes and (ii) remain static while only visual features drift, leading to cross-modal misalignment and unstable predictions. In this paper, we propose CoEvo, a training- and annotation-free test-time framework that performs bidirectional, sample-conditioned adaptation of both textual and visual proxies. Specifically, CoEvo introduces a proxy-aligned co-evolution mechanism to maintain two evolving proxy caches, which dynamically mines contextual textual negatives guided by test images and iteratively refines visual proxies, progressively realigning cross-modal similarities and enlarging local OOD margins. Finally, we dynamically re-weight the contributions of dual-modal proxies to obtain a calibrated OOD score that is robust to distribution shift. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that CoEvo achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving AUROC by 1.33% and reducing FPR95 by 45.98% on ImageNet-1K compared to strong negative-label baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, fine-tuning such large models demands extensive GPU memory and prolonged training time, making them impractical for many real-world low-resource scenarios. To bridge this gap, we propose EfficientFSL, a query-only fine-tuning framework tailored specifically for few-shot classification with ViT, which achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing computational overhead. EfficientFSL fully leverages the knowledge embedded in the pre-trained model and its strong comprehension ability, achieving high classification accuracy with an extremely small number of tunable parameters. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight trainable Forward Block to synthesize task-specific queries that extract informative features from the intermediate representations of the pre-trained model in a query-only manner.

We posit that Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a transformative approach to Neural Architecture Search (NAS), capable of reasoning about architectural code structure in ways that traditional heuristics cannot. In this paper, we investigate the application of an LLM-driven NAS framework to the problem of channel configuration. We formulate the search as a sequence of conditional code generation tasks, where an LLM refines architectural specifications based on performance telemetry. Crucially, we address the data scarcity problem by generating a vast corpus of valid, shape-consistent architectures via Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) mutations. While these mutated networks are not necessarily high-performing, they provide the critical volume of structural data required for the LLM to learn the latent relationship between channel configurations and model performance. This allows the LLM to internalize complex design patterns and apply them to optimize feature extraction strategies. Experimental results on CIFAR-100 validate the efficacy of this approach, demonstrating that the model yields statistically significant improvements in accuracy.

Most existing point cloud completion methods are built on rotation-variant frameworks trained with data in canonical poses, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. While data augmentation with random rotations can partially mitigate this issue, it significantly increases the learning burden and still fails to guarantee robust performance under arbitrary poses. To address this challenge, we propose the Rotation-Equivariant Anchor Transformer (REVNET), a novel framework built upon the Vector Neuron (VN) network for robust point cloud completion under arbitrary rotations. To preserve local details, we represent partial point clouds as sets of equivariant anchors and design a VN Missing Anchor Transformer to predict the positions and features of missing anchors. Furthermore, we extend VN networks with a rotation-equivariant bias formulation and a ZCA-based layer normalization to improve feature expressiveness. Leveraging the flexible conversion between equivariant and invariant VN features, our model can generate point coordinates with greater stability. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on the synthetic MVP dataset in the equivariant setting. On the real-world KITTI dataset, REVNET delivers competitive results compared to non-equivariant networks, without requiring input pose alignment.

Traditional radiomics rely on predefined features chosen at the population level; while more interpretable, they are often too restrictive to capture patient-specific variability and can underperform end-to-end deep learning (DL). To address this, we propose two complementary strategies that bring individuality and interpretability: radiomic fingerprints and healthy personas. First, a radiomic fingerprint is a dynamically constructed, patient-specific feature set derived from MRI. Instead of applying a uniform population-level signature, our model predicts feature relevance from a pool of candidate features and selects only those most predictive for each patient, while maintaining feature-level interpretability. This fingerprint can be viewed as a latent-variable model of feature usage, where an image-conditioned predictor estimates usage probabilities and a transparent logistic regression with global coefficients performs classification. Second, a healthy persona synthesises a pathology-free baseline for each patient using a diffusion model trained to reconstruct healthy knee MRIs. Comparing features extracted from pathological images against their personas highlights deviations from normal anatomy, enabling intuitive, case-specific explanations of disease manifestations.

Recently, Mamba has offered a promising solution through its selective scan mechanism, which enables long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity. However, the Visual Mamba (i.e., VMamba) remains limited in capturing channel-wise frequency characteristics critical for domain alignment and maintaining spatial robustness under significant domain shifts. To address these, we propose a framework called SfMamba to fully explore the stable dependency in source-free model transfer. SfMamba introduces Channel-wise Visual State-Space block that enables channel-sequence scanning for domain-invariant feature extraction. In addition, SfMamba involves a Semantic-Consistent Shuffle strategy that disrupts background patch sequences in 2D selective scan while preserving prediction consistency to mitigate error accumulation. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple benchmarks show that SfMamba achieves consistently stronger performance than existing methods while maintaining favorable parameter efficiency, offering a practical solution for SFDA.

Recent state-of-the-art advocates for enforcing full orthogonality over pairs of text prompt embeddings to enhance separability, and therefore calibration. Nevertheless, as we theoretically show in this work, the inherent gradients from fully orthogonal constraints will strongly push semantically related classes away, ultimately making the model overconfident. Based on our findings, we propose Semantic Orthogonal Calibration (SoC), a Huber-based regularizer that enforces smooth prototype separation while preserving semantic proximity, thereby improving calibration compared to prior orthogonality-based approaches.

We propose CtrlFuse, a controllable image fusion framework that enables interactive dynamic fusion guided by mask prompts. The model integrates a multi-modal feature extractor, a reference prompt encoder (RPE), and a prompt-semantic fusion module (PSFM). The RPE dynamically encodes task-specific semantic prompts by fine-tuning pre-trained segmentation models with input mask guidance, while the PSFM explicitly injects these semantics into fusion features. Through synergistic optimization of parallel segmentation and fusion branches, our method achieves mutual enhancement between task performance and fusion quality.

Such behaviors pose persistent safety and compliance risks in real-world deployments and cannot be reliably mitigated by post-hoc filtering, owing to the limited robustness of such mechanisms and a lack of fine-grained semantic control. Recent unlearning methods seek to erase harmful concepts at the model level, which exhibit the limitations of requiring costly retraining, degrading the quality of benign generations, or failing to withstand prompt paraphrasing and adversarial attacks. To address these challenges, we introduce SafeRedir, a lightweight inference-time framework for robust unlearning via prompt embedding redirection. Without modifying the underlying IGMs, SafeRedir adaptively routes unsafe prompts toward safe semantic regions through token-level interventions in the embedding space. The framework comprises two core components: a latent-aware multi-modal safety classifier for identifying unsafe generation trajectories, and a token-level delta generator for precise semantic redirection, equipped with auxiliary predictors for token masking and adaptive scaling to localize and regulate the intervention. Empirical results across multiple representative unlearning tasks demonstrate that SafeRedir achieves effective unlearning capability, high semantic and perceptual preservation, robust image quality, and enhanced resistance to adversarial attacks. Furthermore, SafeRedir generalizes effectively across a variety of diffusion backbones and existing unlearned models, validating its plug-and-play compatibility and broad applicability.

In recent years, deep learning models have been successfully applied to the automatic segmentation of such lesions. While most proposed architectures are based on the U-Net framework, they primarily differ in their choice of loss functions and in the use of deep supervision, residual connections, and attention mechanisms. Moreover, many implementations are not publicly available, and the optimal configuration for acute ischemic stroke (AIS) lesion segmentation remains unclear. In this work, we introduce ISLA (Ischemic Stroke Lesion Analyzer), a new deep learning model for AIS lesion segmentation from diffusion MRI, trained on three multicenter databases totaling more than 1500 AIS participants. Through systematic optimization of the loss function, convolutional architecture, deep supervision, and attention mechanisms, we developed a robust segmentation framework.

Existing visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks typically rely on medium-resolution data, offering limited visual complexity. To bridge this gap, we introduce Ultra-high-resolution Reasoning Benchmark (UR-Bench), a benchmark designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs under extreme visual information. UR-Bench comprises two major categories, Humanistic Scenes and Natural Scenes, covering four subsets of ultra-high-resolution images with distinct spatial structures and data sources. Each subset contains images ranging from hundreds of megapixels to gigapixels, accompanied by questions organized into three levels, enabling evaluation of models' reasoning capabilities in ultra-high-resolution scenarios. We further propose an agent-based framework in which a language model performs reasoning by invoking external visual tools. In addition, we introduce Semantic Abstraction and Retrieval tools that enable more efficient processing of ultra-high-resolution images. We evaluate state-of-the-art models using both an end-to-end MLLMs and our agent-based framework, demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing methods, which rely on object detection models designed for natural images with more distinct target patterns, struggle to detect dental diseases that present with far less visual support. To address this challenge, we propose {\\bf DentalX}, a novel context-aware dental disease detection approach that leverages oral structure information to mitigate the visual ambiguity inherent in radiographs. Specifically, we introduce a structural context extraction module that learns an auxiliary task: semantic segmentation of dental anatomy. The module extracts meaningful structural context and integrates it into the primary disease detection task to enhance the detection of subtle dental diseases. Extensive experiments on a dedicated benchmark demonstrate that DentalX significantly outperforms prior methods in both tasks. This mutual benefit arises naturally during model optimization, as the correlation between the two tasks is effectively captured.

We evaluate state-of-the-art computer-vision methods for photographic re-identification of the Hula painted frog (Latonia nigriventer) using 1,233 ventral images from 191 individuals collected during 2013-2020 capture-recapture surveys. We compare deep local-feature matching in a zero-shot setting with deep global-feature embedding models. The local-feature pipeline achieves 98% top-1 closed-set identification accuracy, outperforming all global-feature models; fine-tuning improves the best global-feature model to 60% top-1 (91% top-10) but remains below local matching. To combine scalability with accuracy, we implement a two-stage workflow in which a fine-tuned global-feature model retrieves a short candidate list that is re-ranked by local-feature matching, reducing end-to-end runtime from 6.5-7.8 hours to ~38 minutes while maintaining ~96% top-1 closed-set accuracy on the labeled dataset. Separation of match scores between same- and different-individual pairs supports thresholding for open-set identification, enabling practical handling of novel individuals. We deploy this pipeline as a web application for routine field use, providing rapid, standardized, non-invasive identification to support conservation monitoring and capture-recapture analyses.

The proposed method integrates recent advances in super-resolution networks with task-driven super-resolution pipelines, adapting them to the video-based person re-identification setting.

Experimental results demonstrate performance competitive with the baseline, achieving 37.52% mAP in aerial-to-ground and 29.16% mAP in ground-to-aerial scenarios. In the ground-to-aerial setting, S3-CLIP achieves substantial gains in ranking accuracy, improving Rank-1, Rank-5, and Rank-10 performance by 11.24%, 13.48%, and 17.98%, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Meanwhile, 3D visual grounding, as a fundamental task in 3D understanding, still remains challenging due to the limited reasoning ability of recent 3D visual grounding models. Most of the current methods incorporate a text encoder and visual feature encoder to generate cross-modal fuse features and predict the referring object. These models often require supervised training on extensive 3D annotation data. On the other hand, recent research also focus on scaling synthetic data to train stronger 3D visual grounding LLM, however, the performance gain remains limited and non-proportional to the data collection cost. In this work, we propose a 3D visual grounding data pipeline, which is capable of automatically synthesizing 3D visual grounding data along with corresponding reasoning process. Additionally, we leverage the generated data for LLM fine-tuning and introduce Reason3DVG-8B, a strong 3D visual grounding LLM that outperforms previous LLM-based method 3D-GRAND using only 1.6% of their training data, demonstrating the effectiveness of our data and the importance of reasoning in 3D visual grounding.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Traditional 3D instance segmentation methods address viewpoint consistency but require camera poses, depth maps, and expensive preprocessing. We introduce 3AM, a training-time enhancement that integrates 3D-aware features from MUSt3R into SAM2. Our lightweight Feature Merger fuses multi-level MUSt3R features that encode implicit geometric correspondence. Combined with SAM2's appearance features, the model achieves geometry-consistent recognition grounded in both spatial position and visual similarity. We propose a field-of-view aware sampling strategy ensuring frames observe spatially consistent object regions for reliable 3D correspondence learning. Critically, our method requires only RGB input at inference, with no camera poses or preprocessing. On challenging datasets with wide-baseline motion (ScanNet++, Replica), 3AM substantially outperforms SAM2 and extensions, achieving 90.6% IoU and 71.7% Positive IoU on ScanNet++'s Selected Subset, improving over state-of-the-art VOS methods by +15.9 and +30.4 points.

However, evaluating the vulnerability of these schemes against sophisticated removal attacks remains essential to assess their reliability and guide robust design. In this work, we expose a fundamental vulnerability in invisible watermarks by reformulating watermark removal as a view synthesis problem. Our key insight is that generating a perceptually consistent alternative view of the same semantic content, akin to re-observing a scene from a shifted perspective, naturally removes the embedded watermark while preserving visual fidelity. This reveals a critical gap: watermarks robust to pixel-space and frequency-domain attacks remain vulnerable to semantic-preserving viewpoint transformations. We introduce a zero-shot diffusion-based framework that applies controlled geometric transformations in latent space, augmented with view-guided correspondence attention to maintain structural consistency during reconstruction. Operating on frozen pre-trained models without detector access or watermark knowledge, our method achieves state-of-the-art watermark suppression across 15 watermarking methods--outperforming 14 baseline attacks while maintaining superior perceptual quality across multiple datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}
