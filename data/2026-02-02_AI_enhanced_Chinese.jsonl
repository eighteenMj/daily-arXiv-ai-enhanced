In this work, we proposed a family of dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)-based data-driven models that do not require detailed knowledge of the composition of the battery materials but can essentially capture the non-linear dynamics with higher computational efficiency. Only voltage and current data obtained from hybrid pulse power characterization (HPPC) tests were utilized to form the state space matrices and subsequently used for predicting the future terminal voltage at different state of charge (SoC) and aging levels. To construct the system model, 60\\% of the data from a single HPPC test was utilized to generate time-delay embedded snapshots, with embedding dimension ranging from 40 to 2000. Among these, an embedding dimension of 1810 resulted in the least residual sum of squares (RSS) error of 3.86 for the dynamic mode decomposition with control (DMDc) model and 30 for the standard DMD model. For DMDc model, delay embeddings (ranging from 1 to 12) were also incorporated into the input current signals. For the input matrix, an embedding dimension of 6 resulted in a minimum RSS error of 1.74. Furthermore, the system matrices A and B, identified from the HPPC test when the cell is in its healthy state, were held fixed and used to simulate the system dynamics for aged batteries by updating only the control input. Despite the presence of nonlinear degradation effects in later cycles, the DMDc model effectively captured key inner dynamics such as voltage dips and transient responses for subsequent charge and discharge cycles.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We consider an agent that can observe only a single stream at each time, and the goal of the agent is to detect this change as quickly as possible while controlling for false alarms. We propose an algorithm that combines a decaying-$\u03b5$-greedy stream switching rule with an efficient change-point detection algorithm for unknown post-change means. We provide bounds on the expected detection delay and average run length to false alarm for our algorithm, and based on these results we prove our algorithm is approximately optimal with respect to a commonly used surrogate.

However, repeated charging and discharging induces cycling degradation and reduces battery lifetime. This paper studies the real-time scheduling of a heterogeneous battery fleet that collectively tracks a stochastic balancing signal subject to per-battery ramp-rate and capacity constraints, while minimizing long-term cycling degradation.\n  Cycling degradation is fundamentally path-dependent: it is determined by charge-discharge cycles formed by the state-of-charge (SoC) trajectory and is commonly quantified via rainflow cycle counting. This non-Markovian structure makes it difficult to express degradation as an additive per-time-step cost, complicating classical dynamic programming approaches. We address this challenge by formulating the fleet scheduling problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) with constrained action space and designing a dense proxy reward that provides informative feedback at each time step while remaining aligned with long-term cycle-depth reduction.\n  To scale learning to large state-action spaces induced by fine-grained SoC discretization and asymmetric per-battery constraints, we develop a function-approximation reinforcement learning method using an Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) as a random nonlinear feature map combined with linear temporal-difference learning. We evaluate the proposed approach on a toy Markovian signal model and on a Markovian model trained from real-world regulation signal traces obtained from the University of Delaware, and demonstrate consistent reductions in cycle-depth occurrence and degradation metrics compared to baseline scheduling policies.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce JAF: Judge Agent Forest, a framework in which the judge agent conducts joint inference across a cohort of query--response pairs generated by a primary agent, rather than evaluating each in isolation. This paradigm elevates the judge from a local evaluator to a holistic learner: by simultaneously assessing related responses, the judge discerns cross-instance patterns and inconsistencies, whose aggregate feedback enables the primary agent to improve by viewing its own outputs through the judge's collective perspective.\n  Conceptually, JAF bridges belief propagation and ensemble-learning principles: overlapping in-context neighborhoods induce a knowledge-graph structure that facilitates propagation of critique, and repeated, randomized evaluations yield a robust ensemble of context-sensitive judgments. JAF can be instantiated entirely via ICL, with the judge prompted for each query using its associated primary-agent response plus a small, possibly noisy set of peer exemplars. While kNN in embedding space is a natural starting point for exemplars, this approach overlooks categorical structure, domain metadata, or nuanced distinctions accessible to modern LLMs.\n  To overcome these limitations, we develop a flexible locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) algorithm that learns informative binary codes by integrating semantic embeddings, LLM-driven hash predicates, supervision from categorical labels, and relevant side information. These hash codes support efficient, interpretable, and relation-aware selection of diverse exemplars, and further optimize exploration of CoT reasoning paths. We validate JAF with an empirical study on the demanding task of cloud misconfigs triage in large-scale cloud environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The cooling system consists of a fixed-capacity electric chiller and a thermal energy storage (TES) unit, jointly operated to meet stochastic hourly cooling demands under time-varying electricity prices. The life-cycle cost accounts for both capital expenditure and discounted operating cost, including electricity consumption and maintenance. A key challenge arises from the strong asymmetry in capital costs: increasing chiller capacity by one unit is far more expensive than an equivalent increase in TES capacity. As a result, identifying the right combination of chiller and TES sizes, while ensuring zero loss-of-cooling-load under optimal operation, is a non-trivial co-design problem. To address this, we formulate the chiller operation problem for a fixed infrastructure configuration as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP), in which the control action is the chiller part-load ratio (PLR). The MDP is solved using a Deep Q Network (DQN) with a constrained action space. The learned DQN RL policy minimizes electricity cost over historical traces of cooling demand and electricity prices. For each candidate chiller-TES sizing configuration, the trained policy is evaluated. We then restrict attention to configurations that fully satisfy the cooling demand and perform a life-cycle cost minimization over this feasible set to identify the cost-optimal infrastructure design. Using this approach, we determine the optimal chiller and thermal energy storage capacities to be 700 and 1500, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce diversity evolution (DivE), a Boolean-function-based analysis method that tracks how the fading dependence of belief-propagation messages evolves across decoding iterations. Under a Boolean approximation of block fading, DivE derives a Boolean fading function for each variable node (VN) output (i.e., the a-posteriori reliability after iterative decoding), from which the VN diversity order can be directly determined. Building on this insight, we develop a greedy blockmapping search that assigns protograph VNs to fading blocks so that all information VNs achieve full diversity, while including the minimum additional parity VNs when full diversity is infeasible at the nominal rate. Numerical results on the 5G New Radio LDPC codes show that the proposed search finds block mappings that guarantee full diversity for all information bits without modifying the base-graph structure, yielding a markedly steeper high-SNR slope and lower BLER than random mappings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, to achieve SemCom, challenges are faced in accurate semantic quantization for visual data, robust semantic extraction and reconstruction under diverse tasks and goals, transceiver coordination with effective knowledge utilization, and adaptation to unpredictable wireless communication environments. In this paper, we present a systematic review of SemCom for visual data transmission (SemCom-Vision), wherein an interdisciplinary analysis integrating computer vision (CV) and communication engineering is conducted to provide comprehensive guidelines for the machine learning (ML)-empowered SemCom-Vision design. Specifically, this survey first elucidates the basics and key concepts of SemCom.

However, most VQA datasets focus on real-world images or simple diagrammatic analysis, with few focused on interpreting complex scientific charts. Indeed, many VQA datasets that analyze charts do not contain the underlying data behind those charts or assume a 1-to-1 correspondence between chart marks and underlying data. In reality, charts are transformations (i.e. analysis, simplification, modification) of data. This distinction introduces a reasoning challenge in VQA that the current datasets do not capture. In this paper, we argue for a dedicated VQA benchmark for scientific charts where there is no 1-to-1 correspondence between chart marks and underlying data. To do so, we survey existing VQA datasets and highlight limitations of the current field. We then generate synthetic histogram charts based on ground truth data, and ask both humans and a large reasoning model questions where precise answers depend on access to the underlying data.

We introduce the Six Sigma Agent, a novel architecture that achieves enterprise-grade reliability through three synergistic components: (1) task decomposition into a dependency tree of atomic actions; (2) micro-agent sampling where each task is executed n times in parallel across diverse LLMs to generate independent outputs; and (3) consensus voting with dynamic scaling, clustering outputs and selecting the answer from the winning cluster with maximum votes. We prove that sampling n independent outputs with error rate p achieves system error O(p^{ceil(n/2)}), enabling exponential reliability gains. Even using cheaper models with 5% per-action error, consensus voting with 5 agents reduces error to 0.11%; dynamic scaling to 13 agents achieves 3.4 DPMO (Defects Per Million Opportunities), the Six Sigma standard. Evaluation across three enterprise use cases demonstrates a 14,700x reliability improvement over single-agent execution while reducing costs by 80%. Our work establishes that reliability in AI systems emerges from principled redundancy and consensus rather than model scaling alone.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Yet such a deployment would be accompanied by significant electric power requirements at airports due to aircraft charging. Given the growing prevalence of electric vehicles and their bi-directional charging capabilities--so-called vehicle-to-grid (V2G)--we study energy buffer capabilities of parked electric vehicles to alleviate pressure on grid connections. To this end, we present energy management strategies for airports providing cost-optimal apron and landside V2G charge scheduling. Specifically, we first formulate the optimal energy management problem of joint aircraft charging and landside V2G coordination as a linear program, whereby we use partial differential equations to model the aggregated charging dynamics of the electric vehicle fleet. Second, we consider a shuttle flight network with a single hub of a large Dutch airline, real-world grid prices, and synthetic parking garage occupancy data to test our framework. Our results show that V2G at even a single airport can indeed reduce energy costs to charge the aircraft fleet: Compared to a baseline scenario without V2G, the proposed concept yields cost savings of up to 32%, depending on the schedule and amount of participating vehicles, and has other potential beneficial effects on the local power grid, e.g., the reduction of potential power peaks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

M. Adam", "Muhammad Naeem Shah"], "title": "Chance-Constrained Secrecy Optimization in Hybrid RIS-Empowered and UAV-Assisted Networks", "comment": "12 pages, 4 figures", "summary": "This paper considers a hybrid reconfigurable environment comprising a UAV-mounted reflecting RIS, an outdoor STAR-RIS enabling simultaneous transmission and reflection, and an indoor holographic RIS (H-RIS), jointly enhancing secure downlink communication for indoor and outdoor users. The system operates under user mobility, dynamic blockages, colluding idle and active eavesdroppers, and transceiver and surface hardware impairments. A 3GPP and ITU-compliant stochastic channel model is developed, capturing mobility-induced covariance evolution, outdoor-indoor penetration losses, and distortion-aware noise due to practical EVM-based impairments. We aim to minimize the aggregate secrecy-outage probability subject to secrecy-rate constraints, QoS requirements, power limitations, and statistical CSI uncertainty. The resulting problem contains coupled secrecy and QoS chance constraints and nonlinear interactions among the BS beamforming vectors, multi-surface phase coefficients, and UAV position. To handle these difficulties, we derive rigorous Bernstein-type deterministic approximations for all chance constraints, yielding a distributionally robust reformulation. Building on this, we propose an alternating optimization framework that employs successive convex approximation (SCA) to convexify each block and solve the BS beamforming, RIS, STAR-RIS, H-RIS configuration, and UAV placement subproblems efficiently. The proposed algorithm is shown to monotonically decrease a smooth surrogate of the secrecy-outage cost and converge to a stationary point of the robustified problem. Simulations based on 3GPP TR 38.901, TR 36.873, and ITU-R P.2109 demonstrate that integrating UAV-RIS, STAR-RIS, and H-RIS significantly reduces secrecy-outage probability compared with benchmark schemes and provides strong robustness to channel uncertainty, blockages, colluding eavesdroppers, and hardware impairments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7ed3\u5408\u65e0\u4eba\u673aRIS\u3001STAR-RIS\u548c\u5168\u606fRIS\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u5ba4\u5185\u5916\u7528\u6237\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4e0b\u884c\u901a\u4fe1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f00\u53d1\u7b26\u54083GPP/ITU\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u968f\u673a\u4fe1\u9053\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u5904\u7406\u786c\u4ef6\u635f\u4f24\u3001\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u7a83\u542c\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u4e2d\u65ad\u6982\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u79fb\u52a8\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u9ad8\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u906e\u6321\u3001\u534f\u4f5c\u7a83\u542c\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u635f\u4f24\u7b49\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4fdd\u969c\u5ba4\u5185\u5916\u7528\u6237\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u5b89\u5168\u6210\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002\u4f20\u7edfRIS\u6280\u672f\u5b58\u5728\u8986\u76d6\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u6df7\u5408RIS\u67b6\u6784\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u7b26\u54083GPP/ITU\u6807\u51c6\u7684\u968f\u673a\u4fe1\u9053\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u79fb\u52a8\u6027\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u6f14\u53d8\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u635f\u4f24\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4ea4\u66ff\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u51f8\u903c\u8fd1\u5904\u7406\u57fa\u6ce2\u675f\u6210\u5f62\u3001\u591aRIS\u76f8\u4f4d\u914d\u7f6e\u548c\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u4f18\u5316\u7b49\u8026\u5408\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f7f\u7528Bernstein\u578b\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u903c\u8fd1\u5904\u7406\u673a\u4f1a\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u5206\u5e03\u9c81\u68d2\u91cd\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u57fa\u4e8e3GPP TR 38.901\u3001TR 36.873\u548cITU-R P.2109\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u96c6\u6210\u65e0\u4eba\u673aRIS\u3001STAR-RIS\u548c\u5168\u606fRIS\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6848\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u4e2d\u65ad\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u5bf9\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u906e\u6321\u3001\u534f\u4f5c\u7a83\u542c\u548c\u786c\u4ef6\u635f\u4f24\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6df7\u5408RIS\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u901a\u4fe1\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u79fb\u52a8\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b89\u5168\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

They are particularly competent in correcting burst errors, being widely applied in modern communications and data storage systems. This also thanks to their distance property of reaching the Singleton bound, being the maximum distance separable (MDS) codes. This paper proposes a new list decoding for extended RS (eRS) codes defined over a finite field of characteristic two, i.e., F_{2^n}. It is developed based on transforming an eRS code into n binary polar codes. Consequently, it can be decoded by the successive cancellation (SC) decoding and further their list decoding, i.e., the SCL decoding. A pre-transformed matrix is required for reinterpretating the eRS codes, which also determines their SC and SCL decoding performances. Its column linear independence property is studied, leading to theoretical characterization of their SC decoding performance. Our proposed decoding and analysis are validated numerically.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6781\u5316\u7801\u7684\u6269\u5c55RS\u7801\u5217\u8868\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5", "motivation": "Reed-Solomon\u7801\u662f\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u975e\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u7ea0\u9519\u7801\uff0c\u5728\u7ea0\u6b63\u7a81\u53d1\u9519\u8bef\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u73b0\u4ee3\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u7279\u6027\u4e3a2\u7684\u6709\u9650\u57df\u4e0a\u7684\u6269\u5c55RS\u7801\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5217\u8868\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6269\u5c55RS\u7801\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3an\u4e2a\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6781\u5316\u7801\u6765\u5f00\u53d1\u65b0\u578b\u5217\u8868\u89e3\u7801\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u53d8\u6362\u77e9\u9635\u91cd\u65b0\u89e3\u91caeRS\u7801\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u9010\u6b21\u62b5\u6d88(SC)\u89e3\u7801\u53ca\u5176\u5217\u8868\u89e3\u7801(SCL)\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u9884\u53d8\u6362\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u5217\u7ebf\u6027\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8868\u5f81\u4e86SC\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u5206\u6790\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6781\u5316\u7801\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u6269\u5c55RS\u7801\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u6210\u529f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6269\u5c55RS\u7801\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u6781\u5316\u7801\u5217\u8868\u89e3\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u7279\u6027\u4e3a2\u7684\u6709\u9650\u57df\u4e0a\u7684eRS\u7801\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Specifically, it integrates a Global Attention Module (GAM) for cross-scale aggregation, a Deblurring-Segmentation Aligner (DSA) to transfer restoration cues, and a cosine-based scheduler (LoCoS) for stable multi-task optimisation. Experiments on the Kvasir-SEG dataset show that EndoCaver achieves 0.922 Dice on clean data and 0.889 under severe image degradation, surpassing state-of-the-art methods while reducing model parameters by 90%.

We further propose VRRPI-Diag, a diagnostic benchmark that isolates individual motion degrees of freedom. Despite the simplicity of RCPE, most VLMs fail to generalize beyond shallow 2D heuristics, particularly for depth changes and roll transformations along the optical axis. Even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-5 ($0.64$) fall short of classic geometric baselines ($0.97$) and human performance ($0.92$).

Accurate bone segmentation is important for surgical planning and anatomical analysis, but existing 3D voxel-based models such as nnU-Net and STU-Net require heavy computation and often take several minutes per scan, which limits time-critical use. The proposed Bonnet addresses this by integrating a series of novel framework components including HU-based bone thresholding, patch-wise inference with a sparse spconv-based U-Net, and multi-window fusion into a full-volume prediction. Trained on TotalSegmentator and evaluated without additional tuning on RibSeg, CT-Pelvic1K, and CT-Spine1K, Bonnet achieves high Dice across ribs, pelvis, and spine while running in only 2.69 seconds per scan on an RTX A6000. Compared to strong voxel baselines, Bonnet attains a similar accuracy but reduces inference time by roughly 25x on the same hardware and tiling setup.

If LLMs are to participate in high-stakes decisions or serve as models of human behavior, it is critical to assess whether they exhibit analogous patterns of (ir)rationalities and biases. To this end, we evaluate multiple LLM families on (i) benchmarks testing core axioms of rational choice and (ii) classic decision domains from behavioral economics and social norms where emotions are known to shape judgment and choice. Across settings, we show that deliberate \"thinking\" reliably improves rationality and pushes models toward expected-value maximization. To probe human-like affective distortions and their interaction with reasoning, we use two emotion-steering methods: in-context priming (ICP) and representation-level steering (RLS). ICP induces strong directional shifts that are often extreme and difficult to calibrate, whereas RLS produces more psychologically plausible patterns but with lower reliability. Our results suggest that the same mechanisms that improve rationality also amplify sensitivity to affective interventions, and that different steering methods trade off controllability against human-aligned behavior. Overall, this points to a tension between reasoning and affective steering, with implications for both human simulation and the safe deployment of LLM-based decision systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we propose FedAdaVR, a novel FL algorithm aimed at solving heterogeneity issues caused by sporadic client participation by incorporating an adaptive optimiser with a variance reduction technique. This method takes advantage of the most recent stored updates from clients, even when they are absent from the current training round, thereby emulating their presence. Furthermore, we propose FedAdaVR-Quant, which stores client updates in quantised form, significantly reducing the memory requirements (by 50%, 75%, and 87.5%) of FedAdaVR while maintaining equivalent model performance. We analyse the convergence behaviour of FedAdaVR under general nonconvex conditions and prove that our proposed algorithm can eliminate partial client participation error. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets, under both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID settings, demonstrate that FedAdaVR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In the region, the median survival for patients remains under two years, and access to diagnostic imaging is extremely limited. These constraints highlight an urgent need for automated tools that can extract the maximum possible information from each available scan, tools that are specifically trained on local data, rather than adapted from high-income settings where conditions are vastly different. We utilize the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) Africa 2025 Challenge dataset, an expert annotated collection of glioma MRIs. Our objectives are: (i) establish a strong baseline with nnUNet on this dataset, and (ii) explore whether the celebrated \"grokking\" phenomenon an abrupt, late training jump from memorization to superior generalization can be triggered to push performance without extra labels. We evaluate two training regimes. The first is a fast, budget-conscious approach that limits optimization to just a few epochs, reflecting the constrained GPU resources typically available in African institutions. Despite this limitation, nnUNet achieves strong Dice scores: 92.3% for whole tumor (WH), 86.6% for tumor core (TC), and 86.3% for enhancing tumor (ET). The second regime extends training well beyond the point of convergence, aiming to trigger a grokking-driven performance leap. With this approach, we were able to achieve grokking and enhanced our results to higher Dice scores: 92.2% for whole tumor (WH), 90.1% for tumor core (TC), and 90.2% for enhancing tumor (ET).", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Code available at : https://github.com/wiskott-lab/single-vs-hier-recon", "summary": "Vector-quantized variational autoencoders (VQ-VAEs) are central to models that rely on high reconstruction fidelity, from neural compression to generative pipelines. Hierarchical extensions, such as VQ-VAE2, are often credited with superior reconstruction performance because they split global and local features across multiple levels. However, since higher levels derive all their information from lower levels, they should not carry additional reconstructive content beyond what the lower-level already encodes. Combined with recent advances in training objectives and quantization mechanisms, this leads us to ask whether a single-level VQ-VAE, with matched representational budget and no codebook collapse, can equal the reconstruction fidelity of its hierarchical counterpart. Although the multi-scale structure of hierarchical models may improve perceptual quality in downstream tasks, the effect of hierarchy on reconstruction accuracy, isolated from codebook utilization and overall representational capacity, remains empirically underexamined. We revisit this question by comparing a two-level VQ-VAE and a capacity-matched single-level model on high-resolution ImageNet images. Consistent with prior observations, we confirm that inadequate codebook utilization limits single-level VQ-VAEs and that overly high-dimensional embeddings destabilize quantization and increase codebook collapse. We show that lightweight interventions such as initialization from data, periodic reset of inactive codebook vectors, and systematic tuning of codebook hyperparameters significantly reduce collapse. Our results demonstrate that when representational budgets are matched, and codebook collapse is mitigated, single-level VQ-VAEs can match the reconstruction fidelity of hierarchical variants, challenging the assumption that hierarchical quantization is inherently superior for high-quality reconstructions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5355\u5c42VQ-VAE\u5728\u5339\u914d\u8868\u5f81\u9884\u7b97\u4e14\u907f\u514d\u7801\u672c\u574d\u584c\u65f6\uff0c\u5176\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u53ef\u4e0e\u5206\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5ab2\u7f8e\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5206\u5c42\u91cf\u5316\u5728\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u56fa\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u5206\u5c42VQ-VAE\uff08\u5982VQ-VAE2\uff09\u662f\u5426\u771f\u7684\u6bd4\u5355\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0a\u66f4\u5177\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u5b8c\u5168\u6765\u6e90\u4e8e\u5e95\u5c42\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u4e0d\u5e94\u5305\u542b\u989d\u5916\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd1\u5e74\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u91cf\u5316\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u5339\u914d\u8868\u5f81\u9884\u7b97\u4e14\u907f\u514d\u7801\u672c\u574d\u584c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5355\u5c42VQ-VAE\u80fd\u5426\u8fbe\u5230\u5206\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387ImageNet\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u7ea7VQ-VAE\u548c\u5bb9\u91cf\u5339\u914d\u7684\u5355\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\uff1a\u6570\u636e\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u3001\u5b9a\u671f\u91cd\u7f6e\u672a\u4f7f\u7528\u7801\u672c\u5411\u91cf\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u8c03\u4f18\u7801\u672c\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u7801\u672c\u574d\u584c\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u5b9e\u4e86\u4e0d\u5145\u5206\u7684\u7801\u672c\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f1a\u9650\u5236\u5355\u5c42VQ-VAE\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u91cf\u5316\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5e76\u52a0\u5267\u7801\u672c\u574d\u584c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u8ff0\u5e72\u9884\u63aa\u65bd\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u574d\u584c\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5728\u5339\u914d\u8868\u5f81\u9884\u7b97\u4e14\u7f13\u89e3\u7801\u672c\u574d\u584c\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u5355\u5c42VQ-VAE\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4e0e\u5206\u5c42\u53d8\u4f53\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5206\u5c42\u91cf\u5316\u5e76\u975e\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5355\u5c42VQ-VAE\u5728\u9002\u5f53\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u5206\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u4f9d\u8d56VQ-VAE\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff08\u5982\u795e\u7ecf\u538b\u7f29\u548c\u751f\u6210\u7ba1\u9053\uff09\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u542f\u793a\u3002"}}

This paper introduces a novel approach that addresses these limitations. We demonstrate that by spatially resolving the fluorescence profile along the vapor cell, the multi-target problem can be effectively solved. Our approach hinges on the insight that by superimposing incoming signals with a strong local oscillator (LO), the complex atomic absorption pattern is linearized into a simple superposition of sinusoids. In this new representation, each spatial frequency uniquely and directly maps to the DoA of a target. This reduces the multi-target challenge into a spectral estimation problem, which we address using Prony's method. Our approach, termed Imaging-based Spectral Estimation (ISE), inherently supports multi-target detection and restores the full broadband capability of the sensor by removing the restrictive cell-length dependency. This development also shows potential for realizing multi-channel Rydberg receivers and the continuous-aperture sensing required for holographic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO).

Under practical imaging conditions, object detection systems often face challenges such as large scale variations caused by varying camera distances, severe occlusion from plant structures, and highly imbalanced class distributions. These factors make conventional object detection approaches that rely on fully annotated datasets difficult to simultaneously achieve high detection accuracy and deployment efficiency. To overcome these limitations, this research proposes an active learning driven lightweight object detection framework, integrating data analysis, model design, and training strategy. First, the size distribution of objects in raw agricultural images is analyzed to redefine an operational target range, thereby improving learning stability under real-world conditions. Second, an efficient feature extraction module is incorporated to reduce computational cost, while a lightweight attention mechanism is introduced to enhance feature representation under multi-scale and occluded scenarios. Finally, an active learning strategy is employed to iteratively select high-information samples for annotation and training under a limited labeling budget, effectively improving the recognition performance of minority and small-object categories. Experimental results demonstrate that, while maintaining a low parameter count and inference cost suitable for edge-device deployment, the proposed method effectively improves the detection performance of tomatoes and tomato flowers in raw images.

To improve efficiency, we train the value network directly in the latent space, avoiding repeated solver calls during policy optimization.

We consider an ISAC-enabled base station that can sense the state of a remote source and communicate this information back to the source. Both sensing and communication succeed with given probabilities and incur distinct costs. The objective is to optimise a long-term cost that captures information freshness, measured by the age of information (AoI), at the source together with sensing and communication overheads. The resulting sequential decision problem is formulated as a discounted infinite-horizon Markov decision process with a two-dimensional AoI state, representing information freshness at the source and at the base station. We prove that the optimal stationary policy admits a monotone threshold structure characterised by a nondecreasing switching curve in the AoI state space. Our numerical analysis illustrates the structures of the value function and the optimal decision map.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel unsupervised training framework for HS-SISR, based on synthetic abundance data. The approach begins by unmixing the hyperspectral image into endmembers and abundances. A neural network is then trained to perform abundance super-resolution using synthetic abundances only. These synthetic abundance maps are generated from a dead leaves model whose characteristics are inherited from the low-resolution image to be super-resolved. This trained network is subsequently used to enhance the spatial resolution of the original image's abundances, and the final super-resolution hyperspectral image is reconstructed by combining them with the endmembers.

However, training reliable LLM judges is challenging due to severe distribution shifts, including imbalances between easy and hard problems, mismatches between training tasks and evaluation benchmarks, and trajectory mismatch arising from training data generated by cheaper models whose behavior differs from that of inference-time models. We propose DAJ, a reasoning-based LLM judge trained with verifiable rewards under a bi-level data-reweighted learning framework. The proposed framework learns data-importance weights (either domain-level or instance-level) to optimize generalization performance on a held-out meta set aligned with target benchmarks.

We propose an unsupervised Domain-Invariant Visual Enhancement and Restoration (DIVER) framework that integrates empirical correction with physics-guided modeling for robust underwater image enhancement. DIVER first applies either IlluminateNet for adaptive luminance enhancement or a Spectral Equalization Filter for spectral normalization. An Adaptive Optical Correction Module then refines hue and contrast using channel-adaptive filtering, while Hydro-OpticNet employs physics-constrained learning to compensate for backscatter and wavelength-dependent attenuation. The parameters of IlluminateNet and Hydro-OpticNet are optimized via unsupervised learning using a composite loss function. DIVER is evaluated on eight diverse datasets covering shallow, deep, and highly turbid environments, including both naturally low-light and artificially illuminated scenes, using reference and non-reference metrics. While state-of-the-art methods such as WaterNet, UDNet, and Phaseformer perform reasonably in shallow water, their performance degrades in deep, unevenly illuminated, or artificially lit conditions. In contrast, DIVER consistently achieves best or near-best performance across all datasets, demonstrating strong domain-invariant capability. DIVER yields at least a 9% improvement over SOTA methods in UCIQE. On the low-light SeaThru dataset, where color-palette references enable direct evaluation of color restoration, DIVER achieves at least a 4.9% reduction in GPMAE compared to existing methods. Beyond visual quality, DIVER also improves robotic perception by enhancing ORB-based keypoint repeatability and matching performance, confirming its robustness across diverse underwater environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our key innovation eliminates explicit geometric projections by using a geometry-aware foundation model with cross-frame attention to implicitly encode 3D scene understanding in feature space. FlexMap features two core components: a spatial-temporal enhancement module that separates cross-view spatial reasoning from temporal dynamics, and a camera-aware decoder with latent camera tokens, enabling view-adaptive attention without the need for projection matrices.

Given its success in mathematical reasoning, test-time scaling approaches such as Process Reward Model (PRM)-based Best-of-N selection offer a promising way to improve performance. However, existing PRMs remain ineffective for code generation due to the lack of meaningful step decomposition in code and the noise of Monte Carlo-estimated partial-solution correctness scores (rewards). To address these challenges, we propose FunPRM. FunPRM prompts LLMs to encourage modular code generation organized into functions, with functions treated as PRM reasoning steps. Furthermore, FunPRM introduces a novel meta-learning-based reward correction mechanism that leverages clean final-solution rewards obtained via a unit-test-based evaluation system to purify noisy partial-solution rewards. Experiments on LiveCodeBench and BigCodeBench demonstrate that FunPRM consistently outperforms existing test-time scaling methods across five base LLMs, notably achieving state-of-the-art performance on LiveCodeBench when combined with O4-mini.

Under a natural set of operational axioms, the most general form of entropy is captured by the family of R\u00e9nyi entropies, parameterized by a real number $\u03b1$. Conditional entropy extends the notion of entropy by quantifying uncertainty from the viewpoint of an observer with access to potentially correlated side information. However, despite their significance and the emergence of various useful definitions, a complete characterization of measures of conditional entropy that satisfy a natural set of operational axioms has remained elusive. In this work, we provide a complete characterization of conditional entropy, defined through a set of axioms that are essential for any operationally meaningful definition: additivity for independent random variables, invariance under relabeling, and monotonicity under conditional mixing channels. We prove that the most general form of conditional entropy is captured by a family of measures that are exponential averages of R\u00e9nyi entropies of the conditioned distribution and parameterized by a real parameter and a probability measure on the positive reals. Finally, we show that these quantities determine the rate of transformation under conditional mixing and provide a set of second laws of quantum thermodynamics with side information for states diagonal in the energy eigenbasis.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we present a jailbreak framework that exploits post-training Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to construct stealthy prompts capable of bypassing safety filters. To further increase attack success rates (ASR), we propose a ReAct-driven adaptive noising mechanism that iteratively perturbs input images based on model feedback. This approach leverages the ReAct paradigm to refine adversarial noise in regions most likely to activate safety defenses, thereby enhancing stealth and evasion.

While selective thinking strategies improve efficiency by routing easy queries to non-thinking models, existing approaches often incur uncontrollable errors, especially in online settings where the performance loss of a non-thinking model is only partially observed and data are non-stationary. To address this, we propose Betting Probably Approximately Correct (B-PAC) reasoning, a principled method that enables anytime safe and efficient online reasoning under partial feedback. Specifically, we utilize inverse propensity scoring estimators to construct test supermartingales for candidate thresholds, and then dynamically adjust the routing threshold based on the accumulated statistical evidence of safety. Theoretically, we establish the anytime-valid performance loss control and the efficiency of B-PAC reasoning.

This modification has two theoretically motivated and empirically validated consequences. First, it can substantially improve the performance of simple, memory-efficient optimizers, narrowing -- and in some cases closing -- the gap to successful but more complex memory-intensive adaptive methods. We demonstrate this by pretraining 124M parameter transformer models with four optimization algorithms (AdamW, SOAP, SGDM, and Energy Conserving Descent(ECD)) and evaluating both validation loss and downstream logical reasoning. Second, it enables an interpretable use of otherwise redundant rotational degrees of freedom, selectively amplifying semantically meaningful token classes within individual attention heads.

We partially characterize the fundamental trade-offs among three performance measures: the transmitter's secrecy rate, its detection exponent, and the adversary's detection exponent. Beyond the joint input distribution that governs overall performance, the trade-offs are further shaped by the transmitter's ability to extract keys via feedback and hide both the content and structure of the codewords via wiretap and resolvability codes.

While standard pipelines treat these tasks in isolation, our core insight is that they are fundamentally synergistic: restoration provides clean anatomical structures to improve segmentation, while semantic priors regularize the restoration process. VL-DUN resolves the sub-optimality of sequential processing through two primary innovations. (1) We formulate AiOMIRS as a unified optimization problem, deriving an interpretable joint unfolding mechanism where restoration and segmentation are mathematically coupled for mutual refinement. (2) We introduce a frequency-aware Mamba mechanism to capture long-range dependencies for global segmentation while preserving the high-frequency textures necessary for restoration. This allows for efficient global context modeling with linear complexity, effectively mitigating the spectral bias of standard architectures.

However, the clinical implementation and trust of multi-view markerless motion capture (MMMC) require that, in addition to being accurate, these systems produce reliable confidence intervals to indicate how accurate they are for any individual. Building on our prior work utilizing variational inference to estimate joint angle posterior distributions, this study evaluates the calibration and reliability of a probabilistic MMMC method. We analyzed data from 68 participants across two institutions, validating the model against an instrumented walkway and standard marker-based motion capture. We measured the calibration of the confidence intervals using the Expected Calibration Error (ECE). The model demonstrated reliable calibration, yielding ECE values generally < 0.1 for both step and stride length and bias-corrected gait kinematics. We observed a median step and stride length error of ~16 mm and ~12 mm respectively, with median bias-corrected kinematic errors ranging from 1.5 to 3.8 degrees across lower extremity joints. Consistent with the calibrated ECE, the magnitude of the model's predicted uncertainty correlated strongly with observed error measures. These findings indicate that, as designed, the probabilistic model reconstruction quantifies epistemic uncertainty, allowing it to identify unreliable outputs without the need for concurrent ground-truth instrumentation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u7684\u6982\u7387\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6b65\u6001\u53c2\u6570\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e2d\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u8fd0\u52a8\u5206\u6790\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u4ee5\u6307\u793a\u4e2a\u4f53\u6d4b\u91cf\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u65bd\u548c\u4fe1\u4efb\u7684\u5173\u952e\u8981\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u53d8\u5206\u63a8\u7406\u4f30\u8ba1\u5173\u8282\u89d2\u5ea6\u540e\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f7f\u752868\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4eea\u5668\u5316\u6b65\u9053\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u6807\u8bb0\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u671f\u671b\u6821\u51c6\u8bef\u5dee\u8bc4\u4f30\u7f6e\u4fe1\u533a\u95f4\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u6b65\u957f\u548c\u8de8\u6b65\u957f\u5ea6\u7684ECE\u503c\u666e\u904d<0.1\uff1b\u6b65\u957f\u548c\u8de8\u6b65\u957f\u5ea6\u8bef\u5dee\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u5206\u522b\u4e3a~16mm\u548c~12mm\uff1b\u504f\u5dee\u6821\u6b63\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u8bef\u5dee\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u4e3a1.5-3.8\u5ea6\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u89c2\u6d4b\u8bef\u5dee\u9ad8\u5ea6\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\u91cd\u5efa\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u5730\u9762\u771f\u503c\u4eea\u5668\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8bc6\u522b\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u65bd\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u65e0\u6807\u8bb0\u8fd0\u52a8\u6355\u6349\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Zhang"], "title": "Tabular Foundation Models Can Do Survival Analysis", "comment": null, "summary": "While tabular foundation models have achieved remarkable success in classification and regression, adapting them to model time-to-event outcomes for survival analysis is non-trivial due to right-censoring, where data observations may end before the event occurs. We develop a classification-based framework that reformulates both static and dynamic survival analysis as a series of binary classification problems by discretizing event times. Censored observations are naturally handled as examples with missing labels at certain time points.

Previous work attributes this to LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors and attempts to mitigate it through logits calibration. However, they still lack a thorough analysis of the over-reliance. To gain a deeper understanding of over-reliance, we conduct a series of preliminary experiments, indicating that as the generation length increases, LVLMs' over-reliance on language priors leads to inflated probability of hallucinated object tokens, consequently exacerbating object hallucination. To circumvent this issue, we propose Language-Prior-Free Verification to enable LVLMs to faithfully verify the confidence of object existence. Based on this, we propose a novel training-free Self-Validation Framework to counter the over-reliance trap. It first validates objects' existence in sampled candidate captions and further mitigates object hallucination via caption selection or aggregation. Experiment results demonstrate that our framework mitigates object hallucination significantly in image captioning task (e.g., 65.6% improvement on CHAIRI metric with LLaVA-v1.5-7B), surpassing the previous SOTA methods. This result highlights a novel path towards mitigating hallucination by unlocking the inherent potential within LVLMs themselves.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Yet, despite their striking empirical progress, the core mechanisms driving their capabilities remain unelucidated, leaving a critical gap in theoretical understanding. This paper provides the first rigorous theoretical guarantees for SRLMs. We first establish a lower bound that characterizes the fundamental limits of a single update step, revealing a critical dependence on the quality of the initial model. We then derive finite-sample error bounds for the full iterative paradigm, showing that performance improves at a rate of $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}\\left(1/\\sqrt{n}\\right)$ with sample size $n$. Crucially, our analysis reveals that the dependence on the initial model decays exponentially with the number of iterations $T$. This provides a formal explanation for why self-rewarding succeeds: it robustly overcomes poor initialization by steering the dynamics toward internal stability and consistency. Finally, we instantiate our theoretical framework for the linear softmax model class, yielding tailored guarantees that connect our high-level insights to practical model architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing methods primarily support sketch-based interactions for outlining, while the utilization of coarse-grained scribble-based interaction remains limited. Furthermore, current methodologies often encounter challenges due to the abstract nature of scribble instructions, which can result in ambiguous editing intentions and unclear target semantic locations. To address these issues, we propose ScribbleSense, an editing method that combines multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and image generation models to effectively resolve these challenges. We leverage the visual capabilities of MLLMs to predict the editing intent behind the scribbles. Once the semantic intent of the scribble is discerned, we employ globally generated images to extract local texture details, thereby anchoring local semantics and alleviating ambiguities concerning the target semantic locations.

Two theoretical pillars remain missing for FDIL under realistic deployment: a guarantee of backward knowledge transfer (BKT) and a convergence rate that holds across the sequence of all tasks with partial participation. We introduce SPECIAL (Server-Proximal Efficient Continual Aggregation for Learning), a simple, memory-free FDIL algorithm that adds a single server-side ``anchor'' to vanilla FedAvg: in each round, the server nudges the uniformly sampled participated clients update toward the previous global model with a lightweight proximal term. This anchor curbs cumulative drift without replay buffers, synthetic data, or task-specific heads, keeping communication and model size unchanged. Our theory shows that SPECIAL (i) preserves earlier tasks: a BKT bound caps any increase in prior-task loss by a drift-controlled term that shrinks with more rounds, local epochs, and participating clients; and (ii) learns efficiently across all tasks: the first communication-efficient non-convex convergence rate for FDIL with partial participation, O((E/NT)^(1/2)), with E local epochs, T communication rounds, and N participated clients per round, matching single-task FedAvg while explicitly separating optimization variance from inter-task drift.

We propose MPC-Flow, a model predictive control framework that formulates inverse problem solving with flow-based generative models as a sequence of control sub-problems, enabling practical optimal control-based guidance at inference time. We provide theoretical guarantees linking MPC-Flow to the underlying optimal control objective and show how different algorithmic choices yield a spectrum of guidance algorithms, including regimes that avoid backpropagation through the generative model trajectory. We evaluate MPC-Flow on benchmark image restoration tasks, spanning linear and non-linear settings such as in-painting, deblurring, and super-resolution, and demonstrate strong performance and scalability to massive state-of-the-art architectures via training-free guidance of FLUX.2 (32B) in a quantised setting on consumer hardware.", "AI": {"tldr": "MPC-Flow\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u9884\u6d4b\u63a7\u5236\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9006\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u63a7\u5236\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u5f15\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u65e0\u6761\u4ef6\u5148\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f46\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5f15\u5bfc\u5176\u52a8\u6001\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u4e3a\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u6c42\u89e3\u8f68\u8ff9\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u5de8\u5927\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMPC-Flow\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9006\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u63a7\u5236\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u907f\u514d\u5728\u751f\u6210\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u4fee\u590d\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u586b\u5145\u3001\u53bb\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u8d85\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u7b49\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u8bbe\u7f6e\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u5f15\u5bfcFLUX.2\uff08320\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u7b49\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d88\u8d39\u7ea7\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "conclusion": "MPC-Flow\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d41\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u81ea\u7531\u6761\u4ef6\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u7b97\u6cd5\u9009\u62e9\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u7075\u6d3b\u6307\u5bfc\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Inference-time guidance methods such as classifier-free and representative guidance enhance semantic alignment by modifying sampling dynamics; however, they do not fully exploit unsupervised feature representations. Although such visual representations contain rich semantic structure, their integration during generation is constrained by the absence of ground-truth reference images at inference. This work reveals semantic drift in the early denoising stages of diffusion transformers, where stochasticity results in inconsistent alignment even under identical conditioning. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a guidance scheme using a representation alignment projector that injects representations predicted by a projector into intermediate sampling steps, providing an effective semantic anchor without modifying the model architecture. Experiments on SiTs and REPAs show notable improvements in class-conditional ImageNet synthesis, achieving substantially lower FID scores; for example, REPA-XL/2 improves from 5.9 to 3.3, and the proposed method outperforms representative guidance when applied to SiT models. The approach further yields complementary gains when combined with classifier-free guidance, demonstrating enhanced semantic coherence and visual fidelity.

This leads to a research question: Can explicit feedback on table transformation action improve model reasoning capability? In this work, we introduce RE-Tab, a plug-and-play framework that architecturally enhances trajectory search via lightweight, training-free reward modeling by formulating the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process. We demonstrate that providing explicit verifiable rewards during State Transition (``What is the best action?'') and Simulative Reasoning (``Am I sure about the output?'') is crucial to steer the agent's navigation in table states. By enforcing stepwise reasoning with reward feedback in table transformations, RE-Tab achieves state-of-the-art performance in TableQA with almost 25\\% drop in inference cost. Furthermore, a direct plug-and-play implementation of RE-Tab brings up to 41.77% improvement in QA accuracy and 33.33% drop in test-time inference samples for consistent answer.

Code and live demo available at https://github.com/riteshbhadana/IR-Drop-Predictor", "summary": "IR-drop is a critical power integrity challenge in modern VLSI designs that can cause timing degradation, reliability issues, and functional failures if not detected early in the design flow. Conventional IR-drop analysis relies on physics-based signoff tools, which provide high accuracy but incur significant computational cost and require near-final layout information, making them unsuitable for rapid early-stage design exploration. In this work, we propose a deep learning-based surrogate modeling approach for early-stage IR-drop estimation using a CNN. The task is formulated as a dense pixel-wise regression problem, where spatial physical layout features are mapped directly to IR-drop heatmaps. A U-Net-based encoder-decoder architecture with skip connections is employed to effectively capture both local and global spatial dependencies within the layout. The model is trained on a physics-inspired synthetic dataset generated by us, which incorporates key physical factors including power grid structure, cell density distribution, and switching activity. Model performance is evaluated using standard regression metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can accurately predict IR-drop distributions with millisecond-level inference time, enabling fast pre-signoff screening and iterative design optimization.

Unlike heuristic improvements to existing optimizers, RLOs are systematically derived from a novel control-theoretic framework that reinterprets optimization as an extended state discrete-time controlled dynamical system on a Riemannian parameter manifold. Central to this framework is the identification of a Normally Attracting Invariant Manifold (NAIM), which organizes training dynamics into two distinct stages: rapid alignment of the speed state to a target graph, followed by controlled evolution within it. We formalize this by constructing a strict Lyapunov function that certifies convergence to a target manifold. This perspective yields a constructive ``optimizer generator\" that not only recovers classic algorithms but enables the principled design of RLOs. We validate our theory via geometric diagnostics and demonstrate that grounding optimizer design in control theory yields state-of-the-art performance in large-scale benchmarks.

Existing data-driven approaches that incorporate weather as auxiliary input often rely on coarse-grained descriptors and lack dedicated mechanisms to capture fine-grained spatio-temporal effects. Although recent methods adopt causal techniques to improve out-of-distribution generalization, they typically overlook temporal dynamics or depend on fixed confounder stratification. To address these limitations, we propose WED-Net (Weather-Effect Disentanglement Network), a dual-branch Transformer architecture that separates intrinsic and weather-induced traffic patterns via self- and cross-attention, enhanced with memory banks and fused through adaptive gating. To further promote disentanglement, we introduce a discriminator that explicitly distinguishes weather conditions. Additionally, we design a causal data augmentation strategy that perturbs non-causal parts while preserving causal structures, enabling improved generalization under rare scenarios. Experiments on taxi-flow datasets from three cities demonstrate that WED-Net delivers robust performance under extreme weather conditions, highlighting its potential to support safer mobility, highlighting its potential to support safer mobility, disaster preparedness, and urban resilience in real-world settings.

ParalESN enables the construction of high-dimensional and efficient reservoirs based on diagonal linear recurrence in the complex space, enabling parallel processing of temporal data. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that ParalESN preserves the Echo State Property and the universality guarantees of traditional Echo State Networks while admitting an equivalent representation of arbitrary linear reservoirs in the complex diagonal form. Empirically, ParalESN matches the predictive accuracy of traditional RC on time series benchmarks, while delivering substantial computational savings. On 1-D pixel-level classification tasks, ParalESN achieves competitive accuracy with fully trainable neural networks while reducing computational costs and energy consumption by orders of magnitude.

Technically, multi-scale features of the reference subject are first extracted by a visual tokenizer. Instead of interleaving these conditional features with target image tokens across scales, our DreamVAR pre-fills the full subject feature sequence prior to predicting target image tokens.

However, existing benchmarks consider only visual changes, ignoring videos that differ in audio despite visual similarity. To address this limitation, we introduce Composed retrieval for Video with its Audio CoVA, a new retrieval task that accounts for both visual and auditory variations. To support this, we construct AV-Comp, a benchmark consisting of video pairs with cross-modal changes and corresponding textual queries that describe the differences. We also propose AVT Compositional Fusion (AVT), which integrates video, audio, and text features by selectively aligning the query to the most relevant modality. AVT outperforms traditional unimodal fusion and serves as a strong baseline for CoVA.

Post-training such agents is challenging because synthesis for high-quality multi-turn tool-use data is difficult to scale, and reinforcement learning (RL) could face noisy signals caused by user simulation, leading to degraded training efficiency. We propose a unified framework that combines a self-evolving data agent with verifier-based RL. Our system, EigenData, is a hierarchical multi-agent engine that synthesizes tool-grounded dialogues together with executable per-instance checkers, and improves generation reliability via closed-loop self-evolving process that updates prompts and workflow. Building on the synthetic data, we develop an RL recipe that first fine-tunes the user model and then applies GRPO-style training with trajectory-level group-relative advantages and dynamic filtering, yielding consistent improvements beyond SFT. Evaluated on tau^2-bench, our best model reaches 73.0% pass^1 on Airline and 98.3% pass^1 on Telecom, matching or exceeding frontier models.

While prevailing methods rely on resource-intensive fine-tuning of black-box backbones, we propose that forgery detection capability is already encoded within pre-trained models rather than requiring end-to-end retraining. To elicit this intrinsic capability, we propose the discriminative neural anchors (DNA) framework, which employs a coarse-to-fine excavation mechanism. First, by analyzing feature decoupling and attention distribution shifts, we pinpoint critical intermediate layers where the focus of the model logically transitions from global semantics to local anomalies. Subsequently, we introduce a triadic fusion scoring metric paired with a curvature-truncation strategy to strip away semantic redundancy, precisely isolating the forgery-discriminative units (FDUs) inherently imprinted with sensitivity to forgery traces. Moreover, we introduce HIFI-Gen, a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark built upon the very latest models, to address the lag in existing datasets. Experiments demonstrate that by solely relying on these anchors, DNA achieves superior detection performance even under few-shot conditions. Furthermore, it exhibits remarkable robustness across diverse architectures and against unseen generative models, validating that waking up latent neurons is more effective than extensive fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To comprehensively evaluate the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, we introduce the Efficiency-Performance Ratio (EPR), a unified metric that quantifies relative token savings per unit accuracy loss.

We propose to cast workflow generation as Bayesian inference over a posterior distribution on workflows, and introduce \\textbf{Bayesian Workflow Generation (BWG)}, a sampling framework that builds workflows step-by-step using parallel look-ahead rollouts for importance weighting and a sequential in-loop refiner for pool-wide improvements. We prove that, without the refiner, the weighted empirical distribution converges to the target posterior.

Computer vision approaches have been applied to BCS prediction, with depth images widely used because they capture geometric information independent of coat color and texture. More recently, three-dimensional point cloud data have attracted increasing interest due to their ability to represent richer geometric characteristics of animal morphology, but direct head-to-head comparisons with depth image-based approaches remain limited. In this study, we compared top-view depth image and point cloud data for BCS prediction under four settings: 1) unsegmented raw data, 2) segmented full-body data, 3) segmented hindquarter data, and 4) handcrafted feature data. Prediction models were evaluated using data from 1,020 dairy cows collected on a commercial farm, with cow-level cross-validation to prevent data leakage. Depth image-based models consistently achieved higher accuracy than point cloud-based models when unsegmented raw data and segmented full-body data were used, whereas comparable performance was observed when segmented hindquarter data were used. Both depth image and point cloud approaches showed reduced accuracy when handcrafted feature data were employed compared with the other settings. Overall, point cloud-based predictions were more sensitive to noise and model architecture than depth image-based predictions. Taken together, these results indicate that three-dimensional point clouds do not provide a consistent advantage over depth images for BCS prediction in dairy cattle under the evaluated conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u4e09\u7ef4\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u5976\u725b\u4f53\u51b5\u8bc4\u5206(BCS)\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u666e\u904d\u4f18\u4e8e\u70b9\u4e91\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4e14\u70b9\u4e91\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u66f4\u654f\u611f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f53\u51b5\u8bc4\u5206(BCS)\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30\u5976\u725b\u80fd\u91cf\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc4\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u5f3a\u3001\u52b3\u52a8\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u7f3a\u70b9\u3002\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u89c6\u89c9\u6280\u672f\u5df2\u88ab\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eBCS\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f46\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u4e09\u7ef4\u70b9\u4e91\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7814\u7a76\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6bd4\u8f83\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u5f62\u5f0f\u5728BCS\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u4ece\u5546\u4e1a\u519c\u573a\u6536\u96c6\u76841,020\u5934\u5976\u725b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\uff1a1)\u672a\u5206\u5272\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\uff1b2)\u5206\u5272\u7684\u5168\u8eab\u6570\u636e\uff1b3)\u5206\u5272\u7684\u540e\u8eaf\u6570\u636e\uff1b4)\u624b\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\u6570\u636e\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5976\u725b\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4ee5\u9632\u6b62\u6570\u636e\u6cc4\u6f0f\u3002", "result": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u672a\u5206\u5272\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5206\u5272\u5168\u8eab\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u4e00\u76f4\u9ad8\u4e8e\u70b9\u4e91\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u800c\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u5206\u5272\u540e\u8eaf\u6570\u636e\u65f6\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u624b\u5de5\u7279\u5f81\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\u90fd\u6709\u6240\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u70b9\u4e91\u9884\u6d4b\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u7684\u654f\u611f\u5ea6\u66f4\u9ad8\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u4e09\u7ef4\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u6bd4\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u5e76\u672a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u660e\u663e\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u50cf\u5728BCS\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u800c\u70b9\u4e91\u65b9\u6cd5\u5219\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u4ed4\u7ec6\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u5904\u7406\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3002"}}

Yu"], "title": "SHED Light on Segmentation for Dense Prediction", "comment": null, "summary": "Dense prediction infers per-pixel values from a single image and is fundamental to 3D perception and robotics. Although real-world scenes exhibit strong structure, existing methods treat it as an independent pixel-wise prediction, often resulting in structural inconsistencies. We propose SHED, a novel encoder-decoder architecture that enforces geometric prior explicitly by incorporating segmentation into dense prediction. By bidirectional hierarchical reasoning, segment tokens are hierarchically pooled in the encoder and unpooled in the decoder to reverse the hierarchy. The model is supervised only at the final output, allowing the segment hierarchy to emerge without explicit segmentation supervision.

In practice, attackers can exploit large-scale parallel sampling to repeatedly probe a model until a harmful response is produced.

We propose a scaling-aware Best-of-N estimation of risk, SABER, for modeling jailbreak vulnerability under Best-of-N sampling. We model sample-level success probabilities using a Beta distribution, the conjugate prior of the Bernoulli distribution, and derive an analytic scaling law that enables reliable extrapolation of large-N attack success rates from small-budget measurements. Using only n=100 samples, our anchored estimator predicts ASR@1000 with a mean absolute error of 1.66, compared to 12.04 for the baseline, which is an 86.2% reduction in estimation error. Our results reveal heterogeneous risk scaling profiles and show that models appearing robust under standard evaluation can experience rapid nonlinear risk amplification under parallel adversarial pressure.

But clinical reasoning is not text generation. It is a responsibility-bound process under ambiguity, incomplete evidence, and longitudinal context.

We formalise Clinical Contextual Intelligence (CCI) as a distinct capability class required for real-world clinical use, defined by persistent context awareness, intent preservation, bounded inference, and principled deferral when evidence is insufficient.\n  We introduce Meddollina, a governance-first clinical intelligence system designed to constrain inference before language realisation, prioritising clinical appropriateness over generative completeness. Meddollina acts as a continuous intelligence layer supporting clinical workflows while preserving clinician authority. We evaluate Meddollina using a behaviour-first regime across 16,412+ heterogeneous medical queries, benchmarking against general-purpose models, medical-tuned models, and retrieval-augmented systems.\n  Meddollina exhibits a distinct behavioural profile: calibrated uncertainty, conservative reasoning under underspecification, stable longitudinal constraint adherence, and reduced speculative completion relative to generation-centric baselines.

We introduce SCALAR (Structural Consistency And Logic Across Regimes), a benchmark for evaluating geometric scale generalization and its connection to structural hallucination, consistency, and reasoning in materials foundation models. Given canonical crystal representations, models must reason about derived nanoparticle structures obtained through supercell expansion and geometric truncation across length scales spanning a few atoms to over 18,000 atoms, totaling $\\approx$100,000 structures from DFT-validated unit cells. SCALAR defines three tasks. (i) CIF to property prediction. (ii) A Chain-of-Thought variant with explicit physics-grounded reasoning. (iii) Inverse retrieval identifying crystals from candidates given target properties. Outputs are evaluated via structured metrics capturing numeric error, hallucination, cross-prompt consistency, monotonic reasoning, output validity, and retrieval regret. Experiments across diverse foundation models reveal large, model-dependent shifts under explicit reasoning, often reducing hallucination and error, but frequently destabilizing consistency or validity.

However, existing literature has primarily focused on closed-set tasks, such as visual question answering with predefined options or fixed-category classification. This paper considers selective prediction for visual language foundation models, addressing a taxonomy of tasks ranging from closed to open set and from finite to unbounded vocabularies, as in image captioning. We seek training-free approaches of low-complexity, applicable to any foundation model and consider methods based on external vision-language model embeddings, like CLIP. This is denoted as Plug-and-Play Selective Prediction (PaPSP). We identify two key challenges: (1) instability of the visual-language representations, leading to high variance in image-text embeddings, and (2) poor calibration of similarity scores. To address these issues, we propose a memory augmented PaPSP (MA-PaPSP) model, which augments PaPSP with a retrieval dataset of image-text pairs. This is leveraged to reduce embedding variance by averaging retrieved nearest-neighbor pairs and is complemented by the use of contrastive normalization to improve score calibration. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we show that MA-PaPSP outperforms PaPSP and other selective prediction baselines for selective captioning, image-text matching, and fine-grained classification.

Code available at https://github.com/doldam0/tmow", "summary": "Language model (LM)-based embodied agents are increasingly deployed in real-world settings. Yet, their adaptability remains limited in dynamic environments, where constructing accurate and flexible world models is crucial for effective reasoning and decision-making. To address this challenge, we extend the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm to embodied agents. While conventional MoE architectures modularize knowledge into expert components with pre-trained routing, they remain rigid once deployed, making them less effective for adapting to unseen domains in dynamic environments. We therefore propose Test-time Mixture of World Models (TMoW), a framework that enhances adaptability to unseen and evolving domains. TMoW updates its routing function over world models at test time, unlike conventional MoE where the function remains fixed, enabling agents to recombine existing models and integrate new ones for continual adaptation. It achieves this through (i) multi-granular prototype-based routing, which adapts mixtures across object- to scene-level similarities, (ii) test-time refinement that aligns unseen domain features with prototypes during inference, and (iii) distilled mixture-based augmentation, which efficiently constructs new models from few-shot data and existing prototypes. We evaluate TMoW on VirtualHome, ALFWorld, and RLBench benchmarks, demonstrating strong performance in both zero-shot adaptation and few-shot expansion scenarios, and showing that it enables embodied agents to operate effectively in dynamic environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aTMoW\uff08Test-time Mixture of World Models\uff09\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u8def\u7531\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4f7f\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u9002\u5e94\u672a\u89c1\u9886\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u4f20\u7edfMoE\uff08\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\uff09\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u90e8\u7f72\u540e\u8def\u7531\u51fd\u6570\u56fa\u5b9a\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u65ad\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u9886\u57df\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7ebf\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u91cd\u7ec4\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "TMoW\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff1a\uff081\uff09\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u539f\u578b\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u8c61\u5230\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u8c03\u6574\u6df7\u5408\uff1b\uff082\uff09\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7cbe\u70bc\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5bf9\u9f50\u672a\u89c1\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u539f\u578b\uff1b\uff083\uff09\u84b8\u998f\u6df7\u5408\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u4ece\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u548c\u73b0\u6709\u539f\u578b\u9ad8\u6548\u6784\u5efa\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728VirtualHome\u3001ALFWorld\u548cRLBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cTMoW\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9002\u5e94\u548c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u6269\u5c55\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u80fd\u4f7f\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u8fd0\u4f5c\u3002", "conclusion": "TMoW\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u52a8\u6001\u66f4\u65b0\u8def\u7531\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfMoE\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u9002\u5e94\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u672a\u77e5\u548c\u53d8\u5316\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A growing body of alignment research has shown that models initially deemed \"aligned\" can exhibit misaligned behavior after fine-tuning, such as forgetting jailbreak safety features or re-surfacing knowledge that was intended to be forgotten. These works typically assume that the initial model is aligned based on static black-box evaluation, i.e., the absence of undesired responses to a fixed set of queries. In contrast, we formalize model alignment in both the static and post-update settings and uncover a fundamental limitation of black-box evaluation. We theoretically show that, due to overparameterization, static alignment provides no guarantee of post-update alignment for any update dataset. Moreover, we prove that static black-box probing cannot distinguish a model that is genuinely post-update robust from one that conceals an arbitrary amount of adversarial behavior which can be activated by even a single benign gradient update. We further validate these findings empirically in LLMs across three core alignment domains: privacy, jailbreak safety, and behavioral honesty. We demonstrate the existence of LLMs that pass all standard black-box alignment tests, yet become severely misaligned after a single benign update. Finally, we show that the capacity to hide such latent adversarial behavior increases with model scale, confirming our theoretical prediction that post-update misalignment grows with the number of parameters. Together, our results highlight the inadequacy of static evaluation protocols and emphasize the urgent need for post-update-robust alignment evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To tackle this challenge, this paper unveils the root causes of reward hacking and overconfidence in current RL paradigms incorporating uncertainty-based rewards, based on which we propose the UnCertainty-Aware Policy Optimization (UCPO) framework. UCPO employs Ternary Advantage Decoupling to separate and independently normalize deterministic and uncertain rollouts, thereby eliminating advantage bias.

However, existing decoding methods for mitigating video hallucinations, while considering the spatiotemporal characteristics of videos, mostly rely on heuristic designs. As a result, they fail to precisely capture the root causes of hallucinations and their fine-grained temporal and semantic correlations, leading to limited robustness and generalization in complex scenarios. To more effectively mitigate video hallucinations, we propose a novel decoding strategy termed Spatiotemporal-Semantic Contrastive Decoding. This strategy constructs negative features by deliberately disrupting the spatiotemporal consistency and semantic associations of video features, and suppresses video hallucinations through contrastive decoding against the original video features during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only effectively mitigates the occurrence of hallucinations, but also preserves the general video understanding and reasoning capabilities of the model.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Each LLM is equipped with a structured success memory profile derived from prior task trajectories, enabling semantic matching between current reasoning context and past successes. At each decision point, TALC routes control to the most contextually appropriate model and estimates node value using a dual-signal mechanism that fuses model-based evaluations with historical utility scores. These signals are adaptively weighted based on intra-node variance and used to guide MCTS selection, allowing the system to balance exploration depth with planning confidence.

PhoStream contains 5,572 open-ended QA pairs from 578 videos across 4 scenarios and 10 capabilities.

Prior mitigations primarily relies on surface semantic information and fails to efficiently address the misalignment between the reward model (RM) and the policy model caused by continuous policy distribution shifts. This inevitably leads to an increasing reward discrepancy, exacerbating reward overoptimization. To address these limitations, we introduce R2M (Real-Time Aligned Reward Model), a novel lightweight RLHF framework. R2M goes beyond vanilla reward models that solely depend on the semantic representations of a pretrained LLM. Instead, it leverages the evolving hidden states of the policy (namely policy feedback) to align with the real-time distribution shift of the policy during the RL process. This work points to a promising new direction for improving the performance of reward models through real-time utilization of feedback from policy models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faR2M\uff08\u5b9e\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff09\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7RLHF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u6f14\u8fdb\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\uff08\u653f\u7b56\u53cd\u9988\uff09\u6765\u5b9e\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50RL\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u4f20\u7edf\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "RLHF\u6280\u672f\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u5bf9\u9f50\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u5956\u52b1\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u2014\u2014\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u8fc7\u5ea6\u62df\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u865a\u5047\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u5f0f\u800c\u975e\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6355\u6349\u4eba\u7c7b\u610f\u56fe\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7f13\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u5c42\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u56e0\u8fde\u7eed\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u5730\u589e\u52a0\u5956\u52b1\u5dee\u5f02\u5e76\u52a0\u5267\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "method": "R2M\u6846\u67b6\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3LLM\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u7684\u666e\u901a\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5b83\u5229\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\uff08\u5373\u653f\u7b56\u53cd\u9988\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65f6\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u5229\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5956\u52b1\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u521b\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "conclusion": "R2M\u6846\u67b6\u4e3aRLHF\u4e2d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u65f6\u653f\u7b56\u53cd\u9988\u5b9e\u73b0\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u7b56\u7565\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Since models vary widely in capability and price, routing queries to models that balance quality and inference cost is essential. Existing router approaches assume access to centralized query-model evaluation data. However, these data are often fragmented across clients, such as end users and organizations, and are privacy-sensitive, which makes centralizing data infeasible. Additionally, per-client router training is ineffective since local evaluation data is limited and covers only a restricted query distribution and a biased subset of model evaluations. We introduce the first federated framework for LLM routing, enabling clients to learn a shared routing policy from local offline query-model evaluation data. Our framework supports both parametric multilayer perceptron router and nonparametric K-means router under heterogeneous client query distributions and non-uniform model coverage. Across two benchmarks, federated collaboration improves the accuracy-cost frontier over client-local routers, both via increased effective model coverage and better query generalization. Our theoretical results also validate that federated training reduces routing suboptimality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8def\u7531\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u6570\u636e\u788e\u7247\u5316\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u53ca\u672c\u5730\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8def\u7531\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5f0f\u67e5\u8be2-\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u4e2d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6563\u5728\u5404\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\uff08\u7528\u6237\u548c\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff09\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u9690\u79c1\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5fc3\u5316\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u4ec5\u7528\u672c\u5730\u6709\u9650\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5355\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u8986\u76d6\u9762\u7a84\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b58\u5728\u504f\u5dee\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u672c\u5730\u79bb\u7ebf\u67e5\u8be2-\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u8def\u7531\u7b56\u7565\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6301\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u7684\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u5668\u8def\u7531\u5668\u548c\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u7684K-means\u8def\u7531\u5668\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u6784\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u975e\u5747\u5300\u6a21\u578b\u8986\u76d6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8054\u90a6\u534f\u4f5c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u52a0\u6709\u6548\u6a21\u578b\u8986\u76d6\u548c\u6539\u5584\u67e5\u8be2\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u672c\u5730\u8def\u7531\u5668\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027-\u6210\u672c\u6743\u8861\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8054\u90a6\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u8def\u7531\u6b21\u4f18\u6027\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u4e5f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e00\u70b9\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u4f18\u5316LLM\u67e5\u8be2\u8def\u7531\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

They involve a large number of parameters for model updates, being prone to the overfitting problem. To the best of our knowledge, none has explored the strength of the foundation model, having strong generalization power to be quickly adapted to downstream tasks. This paper proposes the MIxup FOundation MOdel (MIFOMO) for CDFSL of HSI classifications. MIFOMO is built upon the concept of a remote sensing (RS) foundation model, pre-trained across a large scale of RS problems, thus featuring generalizable features. The notion of coalescent projection (CP) is introduced to quickly adapt the foundation model to downstream tasks while freezing the backbone network. The concept of mixup domain adaptation (MDM) is proposed to address the extreme domain discrepancy problem. Last but not least, the label smoothing concept is implemented to cope with noisy pseudo-label problems. Our rigorous experiments demonstrate the advantage of MIFOMO, where it beats prior arts with up to 14% margin.

However, these models suffer from inadaptability to fast-changing environments like the web, which can be alleviated by fine-tuning requiring expansive model training and data collection. In this work, we introduce a novel paradigm for enhancing agentic VLM policies at inference without policy retraining. Fundamentally, our approach decouples the VLM's role as a high-capacity action proposer from the final action selection mechanism. We keep the VLM policy frozen and use it to generate a set of candidate actions for a given state.

For training efficiency, rollouts are typically generated in an off-policy manner using an older sampling policy and then used to update the current target policy. To correct the resulting discrepancy between the sampling and target policies, most existing RL objectives rely on a token-level importance sampling ratio, primarily due to its computational simplicity and numerical stability. However, we observe that token-level correction often leads to unstable training dynamics when the degree of off-policyness is large. In this paper, we revisit LLM policy optimization under off-policy conditions and show that the theoretically rigorous correction term is the prefix importance ratio, and that relaxing it to a token-level approximation can induce instability in RL post-training. To stabilize LLM optimization under large off-policy drift, we propose a simple yet effective objective, Minimum Prefix Ratio (MinPRO). MinPRO replaces the unstable cumulative prefix ratio with a non-cumulative surrogate based on the minimum token-level ratio observed in the preceding prefix. Extensive experiments on both dense and mixture-of-experts LLMs, across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, demonstrate that MinPRO substantially improves training stability and peak performance in off-policy regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u6307\u51fa\u5728\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u8bcd\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u6bd4\u5728\u9762\u5bf9\u8f83\u5927\u79bb\u7b56\u504f\u79fb\u65f6\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u5c0f\u8bcd\u7ea7\u6bd4\u7387\u7684\u524d\u7f00\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5MinPRO\u6765\u6539\u5584\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u79bb\u7b56\u6837\u672c\u7684LLM RL\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u4e8e\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5e38\u91c7\u7528\u8bcd\u7ea7\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u6bd4\u8fdb\u884c\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u79bb\u7b56\u504f\u79fb\u8f83\u5927\u65f6\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u8ba8\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u91cd\u65b0\u5ba1\u89c6\u79bb\u7b56\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684LLM\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6b63\u786e\u7684\u4fee\u6b63\u9879\u5e94\u662f\u524d\u7f00\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u6bd4\u7387\u800c\u975e\u8bcd\u7ea7\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002\u63d0\u51faMinPRO\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u524d\u7f00\u4e2d\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u7684\u8bcd\u7ea7\u6bd4\u7387\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u975e\u7d2f\u79ef\u66ff\u4ee3\u54c1\u6765\u53d6\u4ee3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\u524d\u7f00\u6bd4\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u548c\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6LLM\u4e0a\u7684\u591a\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\uff0cMinPRO\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u5728\u79bb\u7b56\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5cf0\u503c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MinPRO\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u524d\u7f00\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u79bb\u7b56\u504f\u79fb\u8f83\u5927\u65f6\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u76f8\u5173\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, they suffer from catastrophic memory forgetting over long sequences due to balancing historical information with new observations. Recent methods alleviate this by deriving adaptive signals from attention perspective, but they operate on single dimensions without considering temporal and spatial consistency. To this end, we propose a training-free framework termed TTSA3R that leverages both temporal state evolution and spatial observation quality for adaptive state updates in 3D reconstruction. In particular, we devise a Temporal Adaptive Update Module that regulates update magnitude by analyzing temporal state evolution patterns. Then, a Spatial Contextual Update Module is introduced to localize spatial regions that require updates through observation-state alignment and scene dynamics. These complementary signals are finally fused to determine the state updating strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TTSA3R in diverse 3D tasks. Moreover, our method exhibits only 15% error increase compared to over 200% degradation in baseline models on extended sequences, significantly improving long-term reconstruction stability.

In this paper, we propose SCOPE (Scalable and Controllable Outcome Performance Estimator), a routing framework that goes beyond model selection by predicting their cost and performance. Trained with reinforcement learning, SCOPE makes reasoning-based predictions by retrieving how models behave on similar problems, rather than relying on fixed model names, enabling it to work with new, unseen models. Moreover, by explicitly predicting how accurate and how expensive a model will be, it turns routing into a dynamic decision problem, allowing users to easily control the trade-off between accuracy and cost.

While previous methods address unified training across multiple datasets, they fail to model geometric relationships in sparse point cloud scenes and ignore the feature distribution in significant areas, which ultimately restricts their performance. To deal with this issue, a unified 3D indoor detection framework, called UniGeo, is proposed. To model geometric relations in scenes, we first propose a geometry-aware learning module that establishes a learnable mapping from spatial relationships to feature weights, which enabes explicit geometric feature enhancement. Then, to further enhance point cloud feature representation, we propose a dynamic channel gating mechanism that leverages learnable channel-wise weighting. This mechanism adaptively optimizes features generated by the sparse 3D U-Net network, significantly enhancing key geometric information.

(2) Intra-group homogenization, coarse-grained outcome rewards often lead to inefficiencies in intra-group advantage estimation with methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) during sampling. To address this, we propose Turn-level Stage-aware Policy Optimization (TSPO).

We study how to design compute-efficient linear attention within this framework. Specifically, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of scaling behavior with respect to parameter counts under different design choices, focusing on (1) normalization paradigms in linear attention (division-based vs. subtraction-based) and (2) depthwise convolution for locality augmentation.\n  Our results show that although subtraction-based normalization is effective for image classification, division-based normalization scales better for linear generative transformers. In addition, incorporating convolution for locality modeling plays a crucial role in autoregressive generation, consistent with findings in diffusion models.\n  We further extend gating mechanisms, commonly used in causal linear attention, to the bidirectional setting and propose a KV gate. By introducing data-independent learnable parameters to the key and value states, the KV gate assigns token-wise memory weights, enabling flexible memory management similar to forget gates in language models.\n  Based on these findings, we present LINA, a simple and compute-efficient T2I model built entirely on linear attention, capable of generating high-fidelity 1024x1024 images from user instructions.

While existing methods typically rely on labor-intensive human demonstrations or automated model exploration to generate GUI trajectories, they lack fine-grained control over task difficulty. This fundamentally restricts learning effectiveness due to the mismatch between the training difficulty and the agent's capabilities. Inspired by how humans acquire skills through progressively challenging tasks, we propose MobileGen, a novel data generation framework that adaptively aligns training difficulty with the GUI agent's capability frontier. Specifically, MobileGen explicitly decouples task difficulty into structural (e.g., trajectory length) and semantic (e.g., task goal) dimensions. It then iteratively evaluates the agent on a curated prior dataset to construct a systematic profile of its capability frontier across these two dimensions. With this profile, the probability distribution of task difficulty is adaptively computed, from which the target difficulty for the next round of training can be sampled. Guided by the sampled difficulty, a multi-agent controllable generator is finally used to synthesize high-quality interaction trajectories along with corresponding task instructions. Extensive experiments show that MobileGen consistently outperforms existing data generation methods by improving the average performance of GUI agents by 1.57 times across multiple challenging benchmarks. This highlights the importance of capability-aligned data generation for effective mobile GUI agent training.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While current language models are not conscious, they exhibit behaviors analogous to certain aspects of consciousness. This paper investigates the implementation of a leading theory of consciousness, Integrated Information Theory (IIT), within language models via a reward-based learning paradigm. IIT provides a formal, axiom-based mathematical framework for quantifying consciousness. Drawing inspiration from its core principles, we formulate a novel reward function that quantifies a text's causality, coherence and integration, characteristics associated with conscious processing. Empirically, it is found that optimizing for this IIT-inspired reward leads to more concise text generation. On out of domain tasks, careful tuning achieves up to a 31% reduction in output length while preserving accuracy levels comparable to the base model. In addition to primary task performance, the broader effects of this training methodology on the model's confidence calibration and test-time computational scaling is analyzed. The proposed framework offers significant practical advantages: it is conceptually simple, computationally efficient, requires no external data or auxiliary models, and leverages a general, capability-driven signal rather than task-specific heuristics.

Existing methods achieve this attribution goal by training models using annotated pairs of synthetic images and their original training sources. However, obtaining such paired supervision is challenging, as it requires either well-designed synthetic concepts or precise annotations from millions of training sources. To eliminate the need for costly paired annotations, in this paper, we explore the possibility of unsupervised synthetic image attribution. We propose a simple yet effective unsupervised method called Alignment and Disentanglement. Specifically, we begin by performing basic concept alignment using contrastive self-supervised learning. Next, we enhance the model's attribution ability by promoting representation disentanglement with the Infomax loss. This approach is motivated by an interesting observation: contrastive self-supervised models, such as MoCo and DINO, inherently exhibit the ability to perform simple cross-domain alignment. By formulating this observation as a theoretical assumption on cross-covariance, we provide a theoretical explanation of how alignment and disentanglement can approximate the concept-matching process through a decomposition of the canonical correlation analysis objective. On the real-world benchmarks, AbC, we show that our unsupervised method surprisingly outperforms the supervised methods.

ExpAlign introduces an Expectation Alignment Head that performs attention-based soft MIL pooling over token-region similarities, enabling implicit token and instance selection without additional annotations. To further stabilize alignment learning, we develop an energy-based multi-scale consistency regularization scheme, including a Top-K multi-positive contrastive objective and a Geometry-Aware Consistency Objective derived from a Lagrangian-constrained free-energy minimization. Extensive experiments show that ExpAlign consistently improves open-vocabulary detection and zero-shot instance segmentation, particularly on long-tail categories.

We first theoretically analyze showing that branch coverage, sample difficulty, syntactic and functional correctness can be jointly modeled as RL rewards, where optimizing these signals can improve the reliability of unit-test-based verification. Guided by this analysis, we design syntax- and functionality-aware rewards and further propose branch- and sample-difficulty--aware RL using exponential reward shaping and static analysis metrics.

At scale, however, Cell Painting data is strongly affected by batch effects arising from differences in laboratories, instruments, and protocols, which can obscure biological signal. We present BALANS (Batch Alignment via Local Affinities and Subsampling), a scalable batch-correction method that aligns samples across batches by constructing a smoothed affinity matrix from pairwise distances. Given $n$ data points, BALANS builds a sparse affinity matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ using two ideas. (i) For points $i$ and $j$, it sets a local scale using the distance from $i$ to its $k$-th nearest neighbor within the batch of $j$, then computes $A_{ij}$ via a Gaussian kernel calibrated by these batch-aware local scales. (ii) Rather than forming all $n^2$ entries, BALANS uses an adaptive sampling procedure that prioritizes rows with low cumulative neighbor coverage and retains only the strongest affinities per row, yielding a sparse but informative approximation of $A$. We prove that this sampling strategy is order-optimal in sample complexity and provides an approximation guarantee, and we show that BALANS runs in nearly linear time in $n$. Experiments on diverse real-world Cell Painting datasets and controlled large-scale synthetic benchmarks demonstrate that BALANS scales to large collections while improving runtime over native implementations of widely used batch-correction methods, without sacrificing correction quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Several recent extensions improve its accuracy by introducing correlated noise across training iterations. Matrix factorization mechanisms are a prominent example, but they correlate noise across many iterations and require storing previously added noise vectors, leading to substantial memory overhead in some settings. In this work, we propose a new noise correlation strategy that correlates noise only with the immediately preceding iteration and cancels a controlled portion of it. Our method relies on noise regeneration using a pseudorandom noise generator, eliminating the need to store past noise. As a result, it requires no additional memory beyond standard DP-SGD.

Yet, despite this temporal capacity, most progress concentrates on static image benchmarks, and SNNs still underperform on dynamic video tasks compared to artificial neural networks (ANNs). In this work, we diagnose a fundamental pass-band mismatch: Standard spiking dynamics behave as a temporal low pass that emphasizes static content while attenuating motion bearing bands, where task relevant information concentrates in dynamic tasks. This phenomenon explains why SNNs can approach ANNs on static tasks yet fall behind on tasks that demand richer temporal understanding.To remedy this, we propose the Pass-Bands Optimizer (PBO), a plug-and-play module that optimizes the temporal pass-band toward task-relevant motion bands. PBO introduces only two learnable parameters, and a lightweight consistency constraint that preserves semantics and boundaries, incurring negligible computational overhead and requires no architectural changes. PBO deliberately suppresses static components that contribute little to discrimination, effectively high passing the stream so that spiking activity concentrates on motion bearing content. On UCF101, PBO yields over ten percentage points improvement. On more complex multi-modal action recognition and weakly supervised video anomaly detection, PBO delivers consistent and significant gains, offering a new perspective for SNN based video processing and understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Gardner"], "title": "Knowledge Gradient for Preference Learning", "comment": null, "summary": "The knowledge gradient is a popular acquisition function in Bayesian optimization (BO) for optimizing black-box objectives with noisy function evaluations. Many practical settings, however, allow only pairwise comparison queries, yielding a preferential BO problem where direct function evaluations are unavailable. Extending the knowledge gradient to preferential BO is hindered by its computational challenge. At its core, the look-ahead step in the preferential setting requires computing a non-Gaussian posterior, which was previously considered intractable.

However, previous methods are prone to overfitting the IV classes, leading to the OOV or undefined classes being misclassified as IV ones with a high confidence score. To address this issue, this paper proposes a zero-shot OOV detector (OOVDet), a novel framework that effectively detects predefined classes while reliably rejecting undefined ones in zero-shot scenes. Specifically, due to the model's lack of prior knowledge about the distribution of OOV data, we synthesize region-level OOV prompts by sampling from the low-likelihood regions of the class-conditional Gaussian distributions in the hidden space, motivated by the assumption that unknown semantics are more likely to emerge in low-density areas of the latent space. For OOV images, we further propose a Dirichlet-based gradient attribution mechanism to mine pseudo-OOV image samples, where the attribution gradients are interpreted as Dirichlet evidence to estimate prediction uncertainty, and samples with high uncertainty are selected as pseudo-OOV images. Building on these synthesized OOV prompts and pseudo-OOV images, we construct the OOV decision boundary through a low-density prior constraint, which regularizes the optimization of OOV classes using Gaussian kernel density estimation in accordance with the above assumption.\n  Experimental results show that our method significantly improves the OOV detection performance in zero-shot scenes.

Traditional views assume that models trained on different data types develop specialized, non-transferable representations. However, recent evidence suggests unexpected convergence: models optimized for distinct tasks may develop similar representational geometries. We investigate whether this convergence extends to embodied action learning by training a transformer-based agent to execute goal-directed behaviors in response to natural language instructions. Using behavioral cloning on the BabyAI platform, we generated action-grounded language embeddings shaped exclusively by sensorimotor control requirements. We then compared these representations with those extracted from state-of-the-art large language models (LLaMA, Qwen, DeepSeek, BERT) and vision-language models (CLIP, BLIP). Despite substantial differences in training data, modality, and objectives, we observed robust cross-modal alignment. Action representations aligned strongly with decoder-only language models and BLIP (precision@15: 0.70-0.73), approaching the alignment observed among language models themselves. Alignment with CLIP and BERT was significantly weaker. These findings indicate that linguistic, visual, and action representations converge toward partially shared semantic structures, supporting modality-independent semantic organization and highlighting potential for cross-domain transfer in embodied AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u5426\u4ea7\u751f\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728BabyAI\u5e73\u53f0\u8bad\u7ec3Transformer\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6267\u884c\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u52a8\u4f5c\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bBLIP\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u6001\uff08\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\uff09\u662f\u5426\u4f1a\u5f62\u6210\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4f20\u7edf\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u4ea7\u751f\u4e13\u95e8\u5316\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u89c2\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u5728BabyAI\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u4f7f\u7528\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u8bad\u7ec3Transformer\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u5d4c\u5165\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLaMA\u7b49\uff09\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08CLIP\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u52a8\u4f5c\u8868\u5f81\u4e0e\u4ec5\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548cBLIP\u6709\u5f3a\u70c8\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08precision@15: 0.70-0.73\uff09\uff0c\u63a5\u8fd1\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0b\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0eCLIP\u548cBERT\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u8f83\u5f31\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u8868\u5f81\u6536\u655b\u4e8e\u90e8\u5206\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6a21\u6001\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u7ec4\u7ec7\uff0c\u4e3a\u5177\u8eabAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u8fc1\u79fb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

However, real-world diagnosis is an iterative inquiry where Clinicians sequentially ask questions and order tests to strategically gather information while managing cost and time. To address this, we first propose Med-Inquire, a new benchmark designed to evaluate an agent's ability to perform multi-turn diagnosis. Built upon a dataset of real-world clinical cases, Med-Inquire simulates the diagnostic process by hiding a complete patient file behind specialized Patient and Examination agents. They force the agent to proactively ask questions and order tests to gather information piece by piece. To tackle the challenges posed by Med-Inquire, we then introduce EvoClinician, a self-evolving agent that learns efficient diagnostic strategies at test time. Its core is a ''Diagnose-Grade-Evolve'' loop: an Actor agent attempts a diagnosis; a Process Grader agent performs credit assignment by evaluating each action for both clinical yield and resource efficiency; finally, an Evolver agent uses this feedback to update the Actor's strategy by evolving its prompt and memory. Our experiments show EvoClinician outperforms continual learning baselines and other self-evolving agents like memory agents.

While this reduces the overhead of full-vector rotations, the effect of block structure on outlier suppression remains poorly understood. To fill this gap, we present the first systematic, non-asymptotic analysis of outlier suppression for block Hadamard rotations. Our analysis reveals that outlier suppression is fundamentally limited by the geometry of the input vector. In particular, post-rotation outliers are deterministically minimized when the pre-rotation $\\ell_1$ norm mass is evenly distributed across blocks. Guided by these insights, we introduce MixQuant, a block rotation-aware PTQ framework that redistributes activation mass via permutations prior to rotation. We propose a greedy mass diffusion algorithm to calibrate permutations by equalizing the expected blockwise $\\ell_1$ norms. To avoid adding inference overhead, we identify permutation-equivariant regions in transformer architectures to merge the resulting permutations into model weights before deployment.

However, existing VLMs remain notably weak at understanding negated clinical statements, largely due to contrastive alignment objectives that treat negation as a minor linguistic variation rather than a meaning-inverting operator. In multi-label settings, prompt-based InfoNCE fine-tuning further reinforces easy-positive image-prompt alignments, limiting effective learning of disease absence. To overcome these limitations, we reformulate vision-language alignment as a conditional semantic comparison problem, which is instantiated through a bi-directional multiple-choice learning framework(Bi-MCQ). By jointly training Image-to-Text and Text-to-Image MCQ tasks with affirmative, negative, and mixed prompts, our method implements fine-tuning as conditional semantic comparison instead of global similarity maximization. We further introduce direction-specific Cross-Attention fusion modules to address asymmetric cues required by bi-directional reasoning and reduce alignment interference. Experiments on ChestXray14, Open-I, CheXpert, and PadChest show that Bi-MCQ improves negation understanding by up to 0.47 AUC over the zero-shot performance of the state-of-the-art CARZero model, while achieving up to a 0.08 absolute gain on positive-negative combined (PNC) evaluation.

We contend that these overlooked statistics, particularly channel-wise variance and dominant (maximum) activations, are highly discriminative for OOD detection. We introduce DAVIS, a simple and broadly applicable post-hoc technique that enriches feature vectors by incorporating these crucial statistics, directly addressing the information loss from GAP.

Here, we introduce a statistical framework for auditing model uniqueness based on In-Silico Quasi-Experimental Design (ISQED). By enforcing matched interventions across models, we isolate intrinsic model identity and quantify uniqueness as the Peer-Inexpressible Residual (PIER), i.e. the component of a target's behavior strictly irreducible to any stochastic convex combination of its peers, with vanishing PIER characterizing when such a routing-based substitution becomes possible. We establish the theoretical foundations of ecosystem auditing through three key contributions. First, we prove a fundamental limitation of observational logs: uniqueness is mathematically non-identifiable without intervention control. Second, we derive a scaling law for active auditing, showing that our adaptive query protocol achieves minimax-optimal sample efficiency ($d\u03c3^2\u03b3^{-2}\\log(Nd/\u03b4)$). Third, we demonstrate that cooperative game-theoretic methods, such as Shapley values, fundamentally fail to detect redundancy. We implement this framework via the DISCO (Design-Integrated Synthetic Control) estimator and deploy it across diverse ecosystems, including computer vision models (ResNet/ConvNeXt/ViT), large language models (BERT/RoBERTa), and city-scale traffic forecasters. These results move trustworthy AI beyond explaining single models: they establish a principled, intervention-based science of auditing and governing heterogeneous model ecosystems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We present a predictive theory that resolves this gap by showing that recoverability follows a measurable law. To elaborate, we formalize recoverability through Expected Recovery Regret (ERR), which quantifies the deviation of a recovery policy from the optimal one under stochastic execution noise, and derive a first-order relationship between ERR and an empirical observable quantity, the Efficiency Score (ES). This yields a falsifiable first-order quantitative law of recovery dynamics in tool-using agents. We empirically validate the law across five tool-use benchmarks spanning controlled perturbations, diagnostic reasoning, and real-world APIs. Across model scales, perturbation regimes, and recovery horizons, predicted regret under the ERR-ES law closely matched observed post-failure regret measured from Monte Carlo rollouts, within delta less than or equal to 0.05.

We introduce the PIES Taxonomy to categorize hallucinations along functional components (Planning vs. Summarization) and error properties (Explicit vs. Implicit). We instantiate this taxonomy into a fine-grained evaluation framework that decomposes the trajectory to rigorously quantify these hallucinations. Leveraging this framework to isolate 100 distinctively hallucination-prone tasks including adversarial scenarios, we curate DeepHalluBench. Experiments on six state-of-theart DRAs reveal that no system achieves robust reliability.

By exploiting the cone geometry of the relative translation invariant quadratic Wasserstein space, we introduce two novel geometric quantities, the relative Wasserstein angle and the orthogonal projection distance, which provide meaningful measures of non-Gaussianity. We prove that the filling cone generated by any two rays in this space is flat, ensuring that angles, projections, and inner products are rigorously well-defined. This geometric viewpoint recasts Gaussian approximation as a projection problem onto the Gaussian cone and reveals that the commonly used moment-matching Gaussian can \\emph{not} be the \\(W_2\\)-nearest Gaussian for a given empirical distribution. In one dimension, we derive closed-form expressions for the proposed quantities and extend them to several classical distribution families, including uniform, Laplace, and logistic distributions; while in high dimensions, we develop an efficient stochastic manifold optimization algorithm based on a semi-discrete dual formulation. Experiments on synthetic data and real-world feature distributions demonstrate that the relative Wasserstein angle is more robust than the Wasserstein distance and that the proposed nearest Gaussian provides a better approximation than moment matching in the evaluation of Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) scores.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6700\u4f18\u8fd0\u8f93\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u76f8\u5bf9Wasserstein\u89d2\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u6295\u5f71\u8ddd\u79bb\u6765\u8861\u91cf\u7ecf\u9a8c\u5206\u5e03\u4e0e\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7b97\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u7ef4\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u8fd1\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e9\u5339\u914d\u7684\u9ad8\u65af\u8fd1\u4f3c\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728W_2\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0b\u5e76\u975e\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u51e0\u4f55\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u5730\u91cf\u5316\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5206\u5e03\u8fd1\u4f3c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u5bf9\u5e73\u79fb\u4e0d\u53d8\u4e8c\u6b21Wasserstein\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u9525\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u4e24\u4e2a\u51e0\u4f55\u91cf\uff1a\u76f8\u5bf9Wasserstein\u89d2\u548c\u6b63\u4ea4\u6295\u5f71\u8ddd\u79bb\uff1b\u5728\u4e00\u7ef4\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u63a8\u5bfc\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\u5e76\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u7ecf\u5178\u5206\u5e03\u65cf\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u60c5\u5f62\u4e0b\u57fa\u4e8e\u534a\u79bb\u6563\u5bf9\u5076\u5f62\u5f0f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u6d41\u5f62\u4f18\u5316\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u586b\u5145\u9525\u662f\u5e73\u5766\u7684\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u91cf\u7684\u826f\u597d\u5b9a\u4e49\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u76f8\u5bf9Wasserstein\u89d2\u6bd4Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u66f4\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6700\u8fd1\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u5728FID\u5f97\u5206\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u6bd4\u77e9\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u51e0\u4f55\u89c6\u89d2\u5c06\u9ad8\u65af\u8fd1\u4f3c\u91cd\u65b0\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u6295\u5f71\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u77e9\u5339\u914d\u9ad8\u65af\u4e0d\u662fW_2\u610f\u4e49\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u8fd1\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u91cf\u4e3a\u975e\u9ad8\u65af\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Traditional metrics struggle to quantify fine-grained texture details and semantic consistency, while existing datasets fail to meet commercial standards in scale and diversity. We present OpenVTON-Bench, a large-scale benchmark comprising approximately 100K high-resolution image pairs (up to $1536 \\times 1536$). The dataset is constructed using DINOv3-based hierarchical clustering for semantically balanced sampling and Gemini-powered dense captioning, ensuring a uniform distribution across 20 fine-grained garment categories. To support reliable evaluation, we propose a multi-modal protocol that measures VTON quality along five interpretable dimensions: background consistency, identity fidelity, texture fidelity, shape plausibility, and overall realism. The protocol integrates VLM-based semantic reasoning with a novel Multi-Scale Representation Metric based on SAM3 segmentation and morphological erosion, enabling the separation of boundary alignment errors from internal texture artifacts.

This setting complicates assurance, because behavior depends on nondeterministic environments and probabilistic model outputs. Prior work introduced runtime verification for agentic AI via Dynamic Probabilistic Assurance (DPA), learning an MDP online and model checking quantitative properties. A key limitation is that developers must manually define the state abstraction, which couples verification to application-specific heuristics and increases adoption friction. This paper proposes TriCEGAR, a trace-driven abstraction mechanism that automates state construction from execution logs and supports online construction of an agent behavioral MDP. TriCEGAR represents abstractions as predicate trees learned from traces and refined using counterexamples. We describe a framework-native implementation that (i) captures typed agent lifecycle events, (ii) builds abstractions from traces, (iii) constructs an MDP, and (iv) performs probabilistic model checking to compute bounds such as Pmax(success) and Pmin(failure).

We formalize this setting as poset-structured safety, modeling safety constraints as a partially ordered set and treating safety composition as a structural property of the policy class. Building on this formulation, we propose PoSafeNet, a differentiable neural safety layer that enforces safety via sequential closed-form projection under poset-consistent constraint orderings, enabling adaptive selection or mixing of valid safety executions while preserving priority semantics by construction.

Recent studies employ autoencoders to achieve this by reconstructing textual CoT from latent tokens, thus encoding CoT semantics. However, treating textual CoT as the reconstruction target forces latent tokens to preserve surface-level linguistic features (e.g., word choice and syntax), introducing a strong linguistic inductive bias that prioritizes linguistic form over reasoning structure and limits logical abstraction. Thus, we propose ImgCoT that replaces the reconstruction target from textual CoT to the visual CoT obtained by rendering CoT into images. This substitutes linguistic bias with spatial inductive bias, i.e., a tendency to model spatial layouts of the reasoning steps in visual CoT, enabling latent tokens to better capture global reasoning structure. Moreover, although visual latent tokens encode abstract reasoning structure, they may blur reasoning details. We thus propose a loose ImgCoT, a hybrid reasoning that augments visual latent tokens with a few key textual reasoning steps, selected based on low token log-likelihood. This design allows LLMs to retain both global reasoning structure and fine-grained reasoning details with fewer tokens than the complete CoT. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of the two versions of ImgCoT.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The risks from failure grow more severe with increasing task scope. It is therefore important to understand how extremely capable AI models will fail: Will they fail by systematically pursuing goals we do not intend? Or will they fail by being a hot mess, and taking nonsensical actions that do not further any goal? We operationalize this question using a bias-variance decomposition of the errors made by AI models: An AI's \\emph{incoherence} on a task is measured over test-time randomness as the fraction of its error that stems from variance rather than bias in task outcome. Across all tasks and frontier models we measure, the longer models spend reasoning and taking actions, \\emph{the more incoherent} their failures become. Incoherence changes with model scale in a way that is experiment dependent. However, in several settings, larger, more capable models are more incoherent than smaller models. Consequently, scale alone seems unlikely to eliminate incoherence. Instead, as more capable AIs pursue harder tasks, requiring more sequential action and thought, our results predict failures to be accompanied by more incoherent behavior. This suggests a future where AIs sometimes cause industrial accidents (due to unpredictable misbehavior), but are less likely to exhibit consistent pursuit of a misaligned goal.

While existing methods certify unlearning via statistical indistinguishability from re-trained models, these guarantees do not naturally extend to model outputs when inputs are adversarially perturbed. In particular, slight perturbations of forget samples may still be correctly recognized by the unlearned model - even when a re-trained model fails to do so - revealing a novel privacy risk: information about the forget samples may persist in their local neighborhood. In this work, we formalize this vulnerability as residual knowledge and show that it is inevitable in high-dimensional settings. To mitigate this risk, we propose a fine-tuning strategy, named RURK, that penalizes the model's ability to re-recognize perturbed forget samples.

We introduce Lingua-SafetyBench, a benchmark of 100,440 harmful image-text pairs across 10 languages, explicitly partitioned into image-dominant and text-dominant subsets to disentangle risk sources. Evaluating 11 open-source VLLMs reveals a consistent asymmetry: image-dominant risks yield higher ASR in high-resource languages, while text-dominant risks are more severe in non-high-resource languages. A controlled study on the Qwen series shows that scaling and version upgrades reduce Attack Success Rate (ASR) overall but disproportionately benefit HRLs, widening the gap between HRLs and Non-HRLs under text-dominant risks.

We study this gap through contextual mathematical reasoning, where the mathematical core must be formulated from descriptive scenarios. We introduce ContextMATH, a benchmark that repurposes AIME and MATH-500 problems into two contextual settings: Scenario Grounding (SG), which embeds abstract problems into realistic narratives without increasing reasoning complexity, and Complexity Scaling (CS), which transforms explicit conditions into sub-problems to capture how constraints often appear in practice. Evaluating 61 proprietary and open-source models, we observe sharp drops: on average, open-source models decline by 13 and 34 points on SG and CS, while proprietary models drop by 13 and 20. Error analysis shows that errors are dominated by incorrect problem formulation, with formulation accuracy declining as original problem difficulty increases. Correct formulation emerges as a prerequisite for success, and its sufficiency improves with model scale, indicating that larger models advance in both understanding and reasoning. Nevertheless, formulation and reasoning remain two complementary bottlenecks that limit contextual mathematical problem solving.

While prior work has examined the energy cost of inference per prompt or per token, we highlight how \\emph{system-level design choices} - such as numerical precision, batching strategy, and request scheduling - can lead to orders-of-magnitude differences in energy consumption for the same model. We perform a detailed empirical study of LLM inference energy and latency on NVIDIA H100 GPUs, analyzing the impact of quantization, batch size, and serving configuration (e.g., with Hugging Face's Text Generation Inference server).

StreamSense handles most timestamps with the lightweight streaming encoder, escalates hard/ambiguous cases to the VLM, and defers decisions when context is insufficient. The encoder is trained using (i) a cross-modal contrastive term to align visual/audio cues with textual signals, and (ii) an IoU-weighted loss that down-weights poorly overlapping target segments, mitigating label interference across segment boundaries. We evaluate StreamSense on multiple social streaming detection tasks (e.g., sentiment classification and hate content moderation), and the results show that StreamSense achieves higher accuracy than VLM-only streaming while only occasionally invoking the VLM, thereby reducing average latency and compute.

To address these limitations, we introduce MedMCP-Calc, the first benchmark for evaluating LLMs in realistic medical calculator scenarios through Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration. MedMCP-Calc comprises 118 scenario tasks across 4 clinical domains, featuring fuzzy task descriptions mimicking natural queries, structured EHR database interaction, external reference retrieval, and process-level evaluation.

Performance also varies considerably across clinical domains.

However, optimisation pressures placed on the CoT may cause the model to obfuscate reasoning traces, losing this beneficial property. We show that obfuscation can generalise across tasks; models that learn to obfuscate reasoning involving reward hacking (e.g. accessing and utilising leaked information) generalise both the reward hacking behaviour and its obfuscation in CoT to unseen reward hacking settings. Most worryingly, we show that obfuscation of CoT reasoning, and its generalisation across tasks, also follows when we penalise only the model's final actions after closing its CoT.

Beyond raw performance, the agentic formulation offers key advantages for realistic design: it naturally incorporates semantic task descriptions, retrieval-augmented domain knowledge, and complex constraints.

Despite this ubiquity, graph structure is typically learned in a modality- and task-isolated manner, where graph representations are constructed within individual task contexts and discarded thereafter. As a result, structural regularities across modalities and tasks are repeatedly reconstructed rather than accumulated at the level of intermediate graph representations. This motivates a representation-learning question: how should graph structure be organized so that it can persist and accumulate across heterogeneous modalities and tasks? We adopt a representation-centric perspective in which graph structure is treated as a structural substrate that persists across learning contexts. To instantiate this perspective, we propose G-Substrate, a graph substrate framework that organizes learning around shared graph structures. G-Substrate comprises two complementary mechanisms: a unified structural schema that ensures compatibility among graph representations across heterogeneous modalities and tasks, and an interleaved role-based training strategy that exposes the same graph structure to multiple functional roles during learning. Experiments across multiple domains, modalities, and tasks show that G-Substrate outperforms task-isolated and naive multi-task learning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We first show these approaches have an inherent fidelity-stability dilemma in how they detect anomalies via reconstruction residuals. We then abandon the reconstruction paradigm entirely and propose Retrieval-based Anomaly Detection (RAD). RAD is a training-free approach that stores anomaly-free features in a memory and detects anomalies through multi-level retrieval, matching test patches against the memory. Experiments demonstrate that RAD achieves state-of-the-art performance across four established benchmarks (MVTec-AD, VisA, Real-IAD, 3D-ADAM) under both standard and few-shot settings. On MVTec-AD, RAD reaches 96.7\\% Pixel AUROC with just a single anomaly-free image compared to 98.5\\% of RAD's full-data performance. We further prove that retrieval-based scores theoretically upper-bound reconstruction-residual scores. Collectively, these findings overturn the assumption that MUAD requires task-specific training, showing that state-of-the-art anomaly detection is feasible with memory-based retrieval.

To mitigate this safety degradation, recent approaches rely on external teacher distillation, yet this introduces a distributional discrepancy that degrades native reasoning. We propose ThinkSafe, a self-generated alignment framework that restores safety alignment without external teachers. Our key insight is that while compliance suppresses safety mechanisms, models often retain latent knowledge to identify harm. ThinkSafe unlocks this via lightweight refusal steering, guiding the model to generate in-distribution safety reasoning traces. Fine-tuning on these self-generated responses effectively realigns the model while minimizing distribution shift. Experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill and Qwen3 show ThinkSafe significantly improves safety while preserving reasoning proficiency.

TSAQA integrates six diverse tasks under a single framework ranging from conventional analysis, including anomaly detection and classification, to advanced analysis, such as characterization, comparison, data transformation, and temporal relationship analysis.

In this paper, we analyze gradient descent (GD) for training two-layer KANs and derive general bounds that characterize their training dynamics, generalization, and utility under differential privacy (DP). As a concrete instantiation, we specialize our analysis to logistic loss under an NTK-separable assumption, where we show that polylogarithmic network width suffices for GD to achieve an optimization rate of order $1/T$ and a generalization rate of order $1/n$, with $T$ denoting the number of GD iterations and $n$ the sample size. In the private setting, we characterize the noise required for $(\u03b5,\u03b4)$-DP and obtain a utility bound of order $\\sqrt{d}/(n\u03b5)$ (with $d$ the input dimension), matching the classical lower bound for general convex Lipschitz problems. Our results imply that polylogarithmic width is not only sufficient but also necessary under differential privacy, revealing a qualitative gap between non-private (sufficiency only) and private (necessity also emerges) training regimes. Experiments further illustrate how these theoretical insights can guide practical choices, including network width selection and early stopping.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Consequently, their reasoning capability is limited when dealing with complex scenes characterized by ambiguity and visual uncertainty. In contrast, human experts, when interpreting remote sensing images in such ambiguous cases, tend to actively query auxiliary images (such as higher-resolution, larger-scale, or temporally adjacent data) to conduct cross-verification and achieve more comprehensive reasoning. Inspired by this, we propose a reasoning-query-driven dynamic segmentation framework for FRSIs, named FarmMind. This framework breaks through the limitations of the static segmentation paradigm by introducing a reasoning-query mechanism, which dynamically and on-demand queries external auxiliary images to compensate for the insufficient information in a single input image. Unlike direct queries, this mechanism simulates the thinking process of human experts when faced with segmentation ambiguity: it first analyzes the root causes of segmentation ambiguities through reasoning, and then determines what type of auxiliary image needs to be queried based on this analysis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FarmMind achieves superior segmentation performance and stronger generalization ability compared with existing methods.

Due to their large size, they are often accessed in the cloud, limiting their application in offline games. Many of these practical issues are solved by pivoting to small language models (SLMs), but existing studies using SLMs have resulted in poor output quality. We propose a strategy of achieving high-quality SLM generation through aggressive fine-tuning on deliberately scoped tasks with narrow context, constrained structure, or both. In short, more difficult tasks require narrower scope and higher specialization to the training corpus. Training data is synthetically generated via a DAG-based approach, grounding models in the specific game world. Such models can form the basis for agentic networks designed around the narratological framework at hand, representing a more practical and robust solution than cloud-dependent LLMs. To validate this approach, we present a proof-of-concept focusing on a single specialized SLM as the fundamental building block. We introduce a minimal RPG loop revolving around rhetorical battles of reputations, powered by this model. We demonstrate that a simple retry-until-success strategy reaches adequate quality (as defined by an LLM-as-a-judge scheme) with predictable latency suitable for real-time generation.

While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate promising semantic reasoning, their quantitative effectiveness for safety-critical 2D object detection is underexplored. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of ten representative LVLMs using the PeSOTIF dataset, a benchmark specifically curated for long-tail traffic scenarios and environmental degradations. Performance is quantitatively compared against the classical perception approach, a YOLO-based detector. Experimental results reveal a critical trade-off: top-performing LVLMs (e.g., Gemini 3, Doubao) surpass the YOLO baseline in recall by over 25% in complex natural scenarios, exhibiting superior robustness to visual degradation. Conversely, the baseline retains an advantage in geometric precision for synthetic perturbations. These findings highlight the complementary strengths of semantic reasoning versus geometric regression, supporting the use of LVLMs as high-level safety validators in SOTIF-oriented automated driving systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Through assigning credit to individual agent actions rather than only at task completion, MAPPA enables fine-grained supervision without ground truth labels while extracting maximal training signal from each rollout. We demonstrate our approach on competition math problems and tool-augmented data analysis tasks. On unseen math problems, MAPPA achieves +5.0--17.5pp on AIME and +7.8--17.2pp on AMC. For data analysis tasks, our method improves success rate by +12.5pp while quality metrics improve by up to 30%, validating that per-action supervision can lead to improvements across different multiagent system on various domains.

We hypothesize that RS FMs enter an overparameterized regime at substantially smaller scales than their CV counterparts, where increasing parameter count primarily induces redundant representations rather than qualitatively new abstractions. To test this hypothesis, we use post-hoc slimming, where we uniformly reduce the width of pretrained encoder, as a tool to measure representational redundancy across six state-of-the-art RS FMs on four downstream classification tasks. Our findings reveal a significant contrast with those in the CV domain: while a post-hoc slimmed masked autoencoder (MAE) trained on ImageNet retains less than 10% accuracy at 1% FLOPs, RS FMs maintain over 71% relative accuracy at the same budget. This sevenfold difference provides strong empirical support for our hypothesis. We further demonstrate that learned slimmable training can improve both Momentum Contrast (MoCo)- and MAE- based models. In addition, through the explained variance ratio and the feature correlation analysis, we provide mechanistic explanations showing that RS FMs distribute task-relevant information with high redundancy. Our findings establish post-hoc slimmability as both a practical deployment strategy for resource-constrained environments and a diagnostic tool that challenges the prevailing scaling paradigm in RS.

Existing incomplete MDL methods either discard missing modalities, risking the loss of valuable task-relevant information, or recover them, potentially introducing irrelevant noise, leading to the discarding-imputation dilemma. To address this dilemma, in this paper, we propose DyMo, a new inference-time dynamic modality selection framework that adaptively identifies and integrates reliable recovered modalities, fully exploring task-relevant information beyond the conventional discard-or-impute paradigm. Central to DyMo is a novel selection algorithm that maximizes multimodal task-relevant information for each test sample. Since direct estimation of such information at test time is intractable due to the unknown data distribution, we theoretically establish a connection between information and the task loss, which we compute at inference time as a tractable proxy. Building on this, a novel principled reward function is proposed to guide modality selection. In addition, we design a flexible multimodal network architecture compatible with arbitrary modality combinations, alongside a tailored training strategy for robust representation learning. Extensive experiments on diverse natural and medical image datasets show that DyMo significantly outperforms state-of-the-art incomplete/dynamic MDL methods across various missing-data scenarios.

Diffusion models are widely used as priors for inverse problems, but standard approaches usually assume a high-fidelity model trained on data that closely match the unknown signal. In practice, one often must use a mismatched or low-fidelity diffusion prior. Surprisingly, these weak priors often perform nearly as well as full-strength, in-domain baselines. We study when and why inverse solvers are robust to weak diffusion priors.

Our solution is based on the celebrated Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), a recent 3D reconstruction method. Additionally, we include specific image capture considerations, which dictate the needed illumination to successfully expose the scene beneath the canopy. To better cope with the poorly lit understory, we employ a low light loss. Finally, we propose two complementary approaches to remove occluding canopy elements by controlling per-ray integration procedure.\n  To validate the value of our approach, we present two possible downstream tasks. For the task of search and rescue (SAR), we demonstrate that our method enables person detection which achieves promising results compared to thermal AOS (using only RGB images).

As forecasting is probabilistic, developing and evaluating AI forecasters requires generating large numbers of diverse and difficult questions, and accurately resolving them. Previous efforts to automate this laborious work relied on recurring data sources (e.g., weather, stocks), limiting diversity and utility. In this work, we present a system for generating and resolving high-quality forecasting questions automatically and at scale using LLM-powered web research agents. We use this system to generate 1499 diverse, real-world forecasting questions, and to resolve them several months later. We estimate that our system produces verifiable, unambiguous questions approximately 96% of the time, exceeding the rate of Metaculus, a leading human-curated forecasting platform. We also find that our system resolves questions at approximately 95% accuracy. We verify that forecasting agents powered by more intelligent LLMs perform better on these questions (Brier score of 0.134 for Gemini 3 Pro, 0.149 for GPT-5, and 0.179 for Gemini 2.5 Flash). Finally, we demonstrate how our system can be leveraged to directly improve forecasting, by evaluating a question decomposition strategy on a generated question set, yielding a significant improvement in Brier scores (0.132 vs. 0.141).", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This assumption breaks down in many real-world settings, where the same object or action may be normal or anomalous depending on latent contextual factors (e.g., running on a track versus on a highway). We revisit \\emph{contextual anomaly detection}, classically defined as context-dependent abnormality, and operationalize it in the visual domain, where anomaly labels depend on subject--context compatibility rather than intrinsic appearance. To enable systematic study of this setting, we introduce CAAD-3K, a benchmark that isolates contextual anomalies by controlling subject identity while varying context. We further propose a conditional compatibility learning framework that leverages vision--language representations to model subject--context relationships under limited supervision. Our method substantially outperforms existing approaches on CAAD-3K and achieves state-of-the-art performance on MVTec-AD and VisA, demonstrating that modeling context dependence complements traditional structural anomaly detection.

Unfortunately, existing approaches often suffer from limited reconstruction fidelity due to the loss of high-frequency details. In this work, we present the DINO Spherical Autoencoder (DINO-SAE), a framework that bridges semantic representation and pixel-level reconstruction. Our key insight is that semantic information in contrastive representations is primarily encoded in the direction of feature vectors, while forcing strict magnitude matching can hinder the encoder from preserving fine-grained details. To address this, we introduce Hierarchical Convolutional Patch Embedding module that enhances local structure and texture preservation, and Cosine Similarity Alignment objective that enforces semantic consistency while allowing flexible feature magnitudes for detail retention. Furthermore, leveraging the observation that SSL-based foundation model representations intrinsically lie on a hypersphere, we employ Riemannian Flow Matching to train a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) directly on this spherical latent manifold.

In practice, prompt pools are often static or only loosely tied to the model's learning progress, so uniform sampling can't keep up with the shifting capability frontier and ends up wasting rollouts on prompts that are already solved or still out of reach. Existing approaches improve efficiency through filtering, curricula, adaptive rollout allocation, or teacher guidance, but they typically assume a fixed pool-which makes it hard to support stable on-policy pool growth-or they add extra teacher cost and latency. We introduce HeaPA (Heap Sampling and On-Policy Query Augmentation), which maintains a bounded, evolving pool, tracks the frontier using heap-based boundary sampling, expands the pool via on-policy augmentation with lightweight asynchronous validation, and stabilizes correlated queries through topology-aware re-estimation of pool statistics and controlled reinsertion. Across two training corpora, two training recipes, and seven benchmarks, HeaPA consistently improves accuracy and reaches target performance with fewer computations while keeping wall-clock time comparable. Our analyses suggest these gains come from frontier-focused sampling and on-policy pool growth, with the benefits becoming larger as model scale increases.

Preprint version; the final camera-ready version may differ", "summary": "Visual anomaly detection in real-world industrial settings faces two major limitations. First, most existing methods are trained on purely normal data or on unlabeled datasets assumed to be predominantly normal, presuming the absence of contamination, an assumption that is rarely satisfied in practice. Second, they assume no access to labeled anomaly samples, limiting the model from learning discriminative characteristics of true anomalies. Therefore, these approaches often struggle to distinguish anomalies from normal instances, resulting in reduced detection and weak localization performance. In real-world applications, where training data are frequently contaminated with anomalies, such methods fail to deliver reliable performance. In this work, we propose a robust anomaly detection framework that integrates limited anomaly supervision into the adaptive deviation learning paradigm. We introduce a composite anomaly score that combines three complementary components: a deviation score capturing statistical irregularity, an entropy-based uncertainty score reflecting predictive inconsistency, and a segmentation-based score highlighting spatial abnormality. This unified scoring mechanism enables accurate detection and supports gradient-based localization, providing intuitive and explainable visual evidence of anomalous regions. Following the few-anomaly paradigm, we incorporate a small set of labeled anomalies during training while simultaneously mitigating the influence of contaminated samples through adaptive instance weighting.

In practice, acquiring these distances depends on labour-intensive manual interpretation of animal observations across large camera trap video corpora. This study introduces and evaluates an only sparsely explored alternative: the integration of computer vision-based monocular depth estimation (MDE) pipelines directly into ecological camera trap workflows for great ape conservation. Using a real-world dataset of 220 camera trap videos documenting a wild chimpanzee population, we combine two MDE models, Dense Prediction Transformers and Depth Anything, with multiple distance sampling strategies. These components are used to generate detection distance estimates, from which population density and abundance are inferred. Comparative analysis against manually derived ground-truth distances shows that calibrated DPT consistently outperforms Depth Anything. This advantage is observed in both distance estimation accuracy and downstream density and abundance inference. Nevertheless, both models exhibit systematic biases. We show that, given complex forest environments, they tend to overestimate detection distances and consequently underestimate density and abundance relative to conventional manual approaches.

Recent RL-based IQA methods built on MLLMs focus on generating visual quality descriptions and scores, ignoring two key reliability limitations: (i) although the model's prediction stability varies significantly across training samples, existing GRPO-based methods apply uniform advantage weighting, thereby amplifying noisy signals from unstable samples in gradient updates; (ii) most works emphasize text-grounded reasoning over images while overlooking the model's visual perception ability of image content. In this paper, we propose Q-Hawkeye, an RL-based reliable visual policy optimization framework that redesigns the learning signal through unified Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic Optimization and Perception-Aware Optimization. Q-Hawkeye estimates predictive uncertainty using the variance of predicted scores across multiple rollouts and leverages this uncertainty to reweight each sample's update strength, stabilizing policy optimization. To strengthen perceptual reliability, we construct paired inputs of degraded images and their original images and introduce an Implicit Perception Loss that constrains the model to ground its quality judgments in genuine visual evidence.

In this work, a novel perspective for MU is presented upon low-dimensional feature subspaces, which gives rise to the potentials of separating the remaining and forgetting data herein. This separability motivates our LOFT, a method that proceeds unlearning in a LOw-dimensional FeaTure subspace from the pretrained model skithrough principal projections, which are optimized to maximally capture the information of the remaining data and meanwhile diminish that of the forgetting data. In training, LOFT simply optimizes a small-size projection matrix flexibly plugged into the pretrained model, and only requires one-shot feature fetching from the pretrained backbone instead of repetitively accessing the raw data. Hence, LOFT mitigates two critical issues in mainstream MU methods, i.e., the privacy leakage risk from massive data reload and the inefficiency of updates to the entire pretrained model. Extensive experiments validate the significantly lower computational overhead and superior unlearning performance of LOFT across diverse models, datasets, tasks, and applications.

We challenge this assumption by formalizing semantic leakage as the ability to recover semantic structures from compressed image embeddings. Surprisingly, we show that semantic leakage does not require exact reconstruction of the original image. Preserving local semantic neighborhoods under embedding alignment is sufficient to expose the intrinsic vulnerability of image embeddings. Crucially, this preserved neighborhood structure allows semantic information to propagate through a sequence of lossy mappings. Based on this conjecture, we propose Semantic Leakage from Image Embeddings (SLImE), a lightweight inference framework that reveals semantic information from standalone compressed image embeddings, incorporating a locally trained semantic retriever with off-the-shelf models, without training task-specific decoders. We thoroughly validate each step of the framework empirically, from aligned embeddings to retrieved tags, symbolic representations, and grammatical and coherent descriptions. We evaluate SLImE across a range of open and closed embedding models, including GEMINI, COHERE, NOMIC, and CLIP, and demonstrate consistent recovery of semantic information across diverse inference tasks. Our results reveal a fundamental vulnerability in image embeddings, whereby the preservation of semantic neighborhoods under alignment enables semantic leakage, highlighting challenges for privacy preservation.1", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u5e76\u975e\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u5176\u4fdd\u7559\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u90bb\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u8bed\u4e49\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7cbe\u786e\u91cd\u5efa\u539f\u56fe\u5373\u53ef\u6062\u590d\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6311\u6218\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u538b\u7f29\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u7559\u8bed\u4e49\u90bb\u57df\u7ed3\u6784\u66b4\u9732\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6839\u672c\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSLImE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u68c0\u7d22\u5668\u4e0e\u73b0\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u4ece\u72ec\u7acb\u538b\u7f29\u5d4c\u5165\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u5f00\u653e\u548c\u5c01\u95ed\u5d4c\u5165\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982GEMINI\u3001COHERE\u3001NOMIC\u3001CLIP\uff09\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u6062\u590d\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u8bc1\u5b9e\u8bed\u4e49\u6cc4\u9732\u7684\u666e\u904d\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u56fe\u50cf\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8bed\u4e49\u90bb\u57df\u5bf9\u9f50\u65f6\u4f1a\u5f15\u53d1\u8bed\u4e49\u6cc4\u9732\uff0c\u8fd9\u5bf9\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

In contrast, from a cognitive science perspective, reward learning remains overly dependent on external feedback, limiting flexibility and generalization. Although recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, mark a significant breakthrough, these models still rely primarily on reward-centric reinforcement learning paradigms. Whether and how the well-established phenomenon of latent learning in psychology can inform or emerge within LLMs' training remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present novel findings from our experiments that LLMs also exhibit the latent learning dynamics. During an initial phase of unrewarded exploration, LLMs display modest performance improvements, as this phase allows LLMs to organize task-relevant knowledge without being constrained by reward-driven biases, and performance is further enhanced once rewards are introduced. LLMs post-trained under this two-stage exploration regime ultimately achieve higher competence than those post-trained with reward-based reinforcement learning throughout. Beyond these empirical observations, we also provide theoretical analyses for our experiments explaining why unrewarded exploration yields performance gains, offering a mechanistic account of these dynamics. Specifically, we conducted extensive experiments across multiple model families and diverse task domains to establish the existence of the latent learning dynamics in LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This requires efficiently managing the stability-plasticity dilemma and leveraging prior experience to rapidly generalize to novel tasks. While various enhancement strategies for both aspects have been proposed, achieving scalable performance by directly applying RL to sequential task streams remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel teacher-student framework that decouples CRL into two independent processes: training single-task teacher models through distributed RL and continually distilling them into a central generalist model. This design is motivated by the observation that RL excels at solving single tasks, while policy distillation -- a relatively stable supervised learning process -- is well aligned with large foundation models and multi-task learning. Moreover, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture and a replay-based approach are employed to enhance the plasticity and stability of the continual policy distillation process.

Markers are commonly used for robot self-localization and object identification. In the RoboCup Logistics League (RCLL), ArUco markers are employed both for robot localization and for identifying processing modules. Conventional recognition relies on OpenCV-based image processing, which detects black-and-white marker patterns. However, these methods often fail under noise, motion blur, defocus, or varying illumination conditions. Deep-learning-based recognition offers improved robustness under such conditions, but requires large amounts of annotated data. Annotation must typically be done manually, as the type and position of objects cannot be detected automatically, making dataset preparation a major bottleneck. In contrast, ArUco markers include built-in recognition modules that provide both ID and positional information, enabling automatic annotation. This paper proposes an automated annotation method for training deep-learning models on ArUco marker images. By leveraging marker detection results obtained from the ArUco module, the proposed approach eliminates the need for manual labeling. A YOLO-based model is trained using the automatically annotated dataset, and its performance is evaluated under various conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method improves recognition performance compared with conventional image-processing techniques, particularly for images affected by blur or defocus. Automatic annotation also reduces human effort and ensures consistent labeling quality.

Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) was designed to improve reasoning, but in fact it worsens this situation through two failure modes: diversity collapse, where training amplifies a single solution strategy while ignoring alternatives of gradient signal, and gradient diminishing, where a large portion of questions yield zero gradients because all rollouts receive identical rewards. We propose TA-GRPO (Transform-Augmented GRPO), which generates semantically equivalent transformed variants of each question (via paraphrasing, variable renaming, and format changes) and computes advantages by pooling rewards across the entire group. This pooled computation ensures mixed rewards even when the original question is too easy or too hard, while training on diverse phrasings promotes multiple solution strategies. We provide theoretical justification showing that TA-GRPO reduces zero-gradient probability and improves generalization via reduced train-test distribution shift.

Conventional slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR) methods are time-consuming and require multiple orthogonal stacks for reconstruction. While learning-based SVR approaches have significantly reduced the time required at the inference stage, they heavily rely on ground truth information for training, which is inaccessible in practice. To address these challenges, we propose GaussianSVR, a self-supervised framework for slice-to-volume reconstruction. GaussianSVR represents the target volume using 3D Gaussian representations to achieve high-fidelity reconstruction. It leverages a simulated forward slice acquisition model to enable self-supervised training, alleviating the need for ground-truth volumes. Furthermore, to enhance both accuracy and efficiency, we introduce a multi-resolution training strategy that jointly optimizes Gaussian parameters and spatial transformations across different resolution levels. Experiments show that GaussianSVR outperforms the baseline methods on fetal MR volumetric reconstruction.

To address this, we propose STARS (Spike-Triggered Adaptive Reasoning Steering), a training-free framework designed to rectify cognitive inertia by monitoring latent dynamics. STARS identifies Cognitive Pivots-critical moments of reasoning transition-by detecting distinct L2 distance spikes in the hidden states. Upon detection, the framework employs geometric trajectory analysis to diagnose the structural nature of the transition and injects state-aware language cues to steer the model in real-time.

Prior work has produced theoretical guarantees and empirical advances for reward-based fine-tuning formulations, but these methods often impose restrictions on permissible drift structure or training techniques. In this work, we propose Gradual Fine-Tuning (GFT), a principled framework for fine-tuning flow-based generative models when samples from the target distribution are available. For stochastic flows, GFT defines a temperature-controlled sequence of intermediate objectives that smoothly interpolate between the pretrained and target drifts, approaching the true target as the temperature approaches zero. We prove convergence results for both marginal and conditional GFT objectives, enabling the use of suitable (e.g., optimal transport) couplings during GFT while preserving correctness. Empirically, GFT improves convergence stability and shortens probability paths, resulting in faster inference, while maintaining generation quality comparable to standard fine-tuning.

Existing paradigms rely on either large-scale retrieval, which requires storing a large number of image embeddings, grid-based classifiers that ignore geographic continuity, or generative models that diffuse over space but struggle with fine detail. We introduce an entity-centric formulation of geolocation that replaces image-to-image retrieval with a compact hierarchy of geographic entities embedded in Hyperbolic space. Images are aligned directly to country, region, subregion, and city entities through Geo-Weighted Hyperbolic contrastive learning by directly incorporating haversine distance into the contrastive objective. This hierarchical design enables interpretable predictions and efficient inference with 240k entity embeddings instead of over 5 million image embeddings on the OSV5M benchmark, on which our method establishes a new state-of-the-art performance. Compared to the current methods in the literature, it reduces mean geodesic error by 19.5\\%, while improving the fine-grained subregion accuracy by 43%.

A critical design choice in such architectures is the goal representation-the compressed encoding of goals that serves as the interface between these levels. Existing approaches commonly derive goal representations while learning value functions, implicitly assuming that preserving information sufficient for value estimation is adequate for optimal control. We show that this assumption can fail, even when the value estimation is exact, as such representations may collapse goal states that need to be differentiated for action learning. To address this, we introduce an information-theoretic framework that defines action sufficiency, a condition on goal representations necessary for optimal action selection. We prove that value sufficiency does not imply action sufficiency and empirically verify that the latter is more strongly associated with control success in a discrete environment. We further demonstrate that standard log-loss training of low-level policies naturally induces action-sufficient representations.

In this paper, we study a novel lifelong learning paradigm for neural VRP solvers under continually drifting tasks over learning time steps, where sufficient training for any given task at any time is not available. We propose Dual Replay with Experience Enhancement (DREE), a general framework to improve learning efficiency and mitigate catastrophic forgetting under such drift.

Angular misalignments of LiDAR sensors can lead to safety-critical issues during autonomous operation. However, current methods primarily focus on correcting sensor-to-sensor errors without considering the miscalibration of individual sensors that cause these errors in the first place. We introduce FlowCalib, the first framework that detects LiDAR-to-vehicle miscalibration using motion cues from the scene flow of static objects. Our approach leverages the systematic bias induced by rotational misalignment in the flow field generated from sequential 3D point clouds, eliminating the need for additional sensors. The architecture integrates a neural scene flow prior for flow estimation and incorporates a dual-branch detection network that fuses learned global flow features with handcrafted geometric descriptors. These combined representations allow the system to perform two complementary binary classification tasks: a global binary decision indicating whether misalignment is present and separate, axis-specific binary decisions indicating whether each rotational axis is misaligned. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate FlowCalib's ability to robustly detect miscalibration, establishing a benchmark for sensor-to-vehicle miscalibration detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While recent work reveals the discrepancy between LLMs and humans in skill compositions, the learning dynamics of skill compositions and the underlying cause of non-human behavior remain elusive. In this study, we investigate the mechanism of learning dynamics by training transformers on synthetic arithmetic tasks. Through extensive ablations and fine-grained diagnostic metrics, we discover that transformers do not reliably build skill compositions according to human-like sequential rules. Instead, they often acquire skills in reverse order or in parallel, which leads to unexpected mixing errors especially under distribution shifts--a phenomenon we refer to as shattered compositionality. To explain these behaviors, we provide evidence that correlational matching to the training data, rather than causal or procedural composition, shapes learning dynamics. We further show that shattered compositionality persists in modern LLMs and is not mitigated by pure model scaling or scratchpad-based reasoning. Our results reveal a fundamental mismatch between a model's learning behavior and desired skill compositions, with implications for reasoning reliability, out-of-distribution robustness, and alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, related studies on event sensors are scarce or narrowly centered on semantic-level understanding. We introduce SEAL, the first Semantic-aware Segment Any Events framework that addresses Open-Vocabulary Event Instance Segmentation (OV-EIS). Given the visual prompt, our model presents a unified framework to support both event segmentation and open-vocabulary mask classification at multiple levels of granularity, including instance-level and part-level. To enable thorough evaluation on OV-EIS, we curate four benchmarks that cover label granularity from coarse to fine class configurations and semantic granularity from instance-level to part-level understanding. Extensive experiments show that our SEAL largely outperforms proposed baselines in terms of performance and inference speed with a parameter-efficient architecture. In the Appendix, we further present a simple variant of our SEAL achieving generic spatiotemporal OV-EIS that does not require any visual prompts from users in the inference.

This letter investigates the three-dimensional trajectory planning in a UAV-assisted VLC system, where a UAV is dispatched to collect data from ground users (GUs). The core objective is to develop a trajectory planning framework that minimizes UAV flight distance, which is equivalent to maximizing the data collection efficiency. This issue is formulated as a challenging mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem. To tackle it, we first derive a closed-form optimal flight altitude under specific VLC channel gain threshold. Subsequently, we optimize the UAV horizontal trajectory by integrating a novel pheromone-driven reward mechanism with the twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm, which enables adaptive UAV motion strategy in complex environments. Simulation results validate that the derived optimal altitude effectively reduces the flight distance by up to 35% compared to baseline methods. Additionally, the proposed reward mechanism significantly shortens the convergence steps by approximately 50%, demonstrating notable efficiency gains in the context of UAV-assisted VLC data collection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f85\u52a9\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u7ef4\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u98de\u884c\u8ddd\u79bb\u6765\u6700\u5927\u5316\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u6548\u7387\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u6700\u4f18\u98de\u884c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u7d20\u9a71\u52a8\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u4f18\u5316\u6c34\u5e73\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u98de\u884c\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u6536\u655b\u6b65\u6570\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u4e0e\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u901a\u4fe1\u7684\u878d\u5408\u4e3a\u7075\u6d3b\u901a\u4fe1\u548c\u9ad8\u6548\u7167\u660e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6848\u3002\u4f46\u5728\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f85\u52a9VLC\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u89c4\u5212\u4e09\u7ef4\u8f68\u8ff9\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u98de\u884c\u8ddd\u79bb\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u6548\u7387\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "1) \u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7279\u5b9aVLC\u4fe1\u9053\u589e\u76ca\u9608\u503c\u4e0b\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u98de\u884c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u7ed3\u5408\u4fe1\u606f\u7d20\u9a71\u52a8\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u7684\u53cc\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6df1\u5ea6\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u6c34\u5e73\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6700\u4f18\u98de\u884c\u9ad8\u5ea6\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c1135%\u7684\u98de\u884c\u8ddd\u79bb\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\u7f29\u77ed\u7ea650%\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6b65\u6570\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8f85\u52a9VLC\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u9ad8\u5ea6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5956\u52b1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u8fd0\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

Predicting this disease early is challenging because it depends on traditional diagnostic methods that face issues of subjectivity, which commonly delay diagnosis. Several objective analyses are currently in practice to help overcome the challenges of subjectivity; however, a proper explanation of these analyses is still lacking. While machine learning (ML) has demonstrated potential in supporting PD diagnosis, existing approaches often rely on subjective reports only and lack interpretability for individualized risk estimation. This study proposes SCOPE-PD, an explainable AI-based prediction framework, by integrating subjective and objective assessments to provide personalized health decisions. Subjective and objective clinical assessment data are collected from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI) study to construct a multimodal prediction framework. Several ML techniques are applied to these data, and the best ML model is selected to interpret the results. Model interpretability is examined using SHAP-based analysis. The Random Forest algorithm achieves the highest accuracy of 98.66 percent using combined features from both subjective and objective test data. Tremor, bradykinesia, and facial expression are identified as the top three contributing features from the MDS-UPDRS test in the prediction of PD.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper introduces Med-Scout, a novel framework that \"cures\" this blindness via Reinforcement Learning (RL) that leverages the intrinsic geometric logic latent within unlabeled medical images. Instead of relying on costly expert annotations, Med-Scout derives verifiable supervision signals through three strategic proxy tasks: Hierarchical Scale Localization, Topological Jigsaw Reconstruction, and Anomaly Consistency Detection. To rigorously quantify this deficit, we present Med-Scout-Bench, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate geometric perception. Extensive evaluations show that Med-Scout significantly mitigates geometric blindness, outperforming leading proprietary and open-source MLLMs by over 40% on our benchmark.

Diffusion models for graphs often adopt largely factorized forward-noising, and many flow-matching methods start from factorized reference noise and coordinate-wise interpolation, so node-edge coupling is not encoded by the generative geometry and must be recovered implicitly by the core network, which can be brittle after discrete decoding. Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs) evolve distribution parameters and naturally support discrete generation. But classical BFNs typically rely on factorized beliefs and independent channels, which limit geometric evidence fusion. We propose Variational Bayesian Flow Network (VBFN), which performs a variational lifting to a tractable joint Gaussian variational belief family governed by structured precisions.

In contrast, many deployed systems already produce inexpensive automatic quality-control (QC) signals like model agreement, uncertainty measures, or learned mask-quality scores which can be used for further model training without additional ground-truth annotation. However, these signals can be noisy and biased, making preference-based fine-tuning susceptible to harmful updates. We study Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for segmentation from such noisy judges using proposals generated by a supervised base segmenter trained on a small labeled set. We find that outcomes depend strongly on how preference pairs are mined: selecting the judge's top-ranked proposal can improve peak performance when the judge is reliable, but can amplify harmful errors under weaker judges. We propose Region-Normalized DPO (RN-DPO), a segmentation-aware objective which normalizes preference updates by the size of the disagreement region between masks, reducing the leverage of harmful comparisons and improving optimization stability. Across two medical datasets and multiple regimes, RN-DPO improves sustained performance and stabilizes preference-based fine-tuning, outperforming standard DPO and strong baselines without requiring additional pixel annotations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5c06\u566a\u58f0\u8d28\u91cf\u4fe1\u53f7\u7528\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u7684\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u533a\u57df\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u6539\u5584\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\uff08\u5982\u6a21\u578b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u7b49\uff09\u867d\u7136\u6210\u672c\u4f4e\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u504f\u597d\u5fae\u8c03\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6709\u5bb3\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Region-Normalized DPO (RN-DPO)\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u5206\u5272\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u63a9\u6a21\u95f4\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u533a\u57df\u7684\u504f\u597d\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u6709\u5bb3\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u4f18\u5316\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u5728\u5c0f\u578b\u6807\u6ce8\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u57fa\u7840\u5206\u5272\u5668\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u6848\uff0c\u5e76\u9488\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u8bc4\u5224\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u533b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u591a\u79cd\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0cRN-DPO\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u504f\u597d\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u7684DPO\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u989d\u5916\u7684\u50cf\u7d20\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "conclusion": "RN-DPO\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u566a\u58f0\u81ea\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u533a\u57df\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u673a\u5236\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u566a\u58f0\u8bc4\u5224\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6709\u5bb3\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4e3a\u65e0\u989d\u5916\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u6539\u8fdb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The general idea of rationale extraction (RE) is to provide an interpretable-by-design framework for DNNs via a select-predict architecture where two neural networks learn jointly to perform feature selection and prediction, respectively. Given only the remote supervision from the final task prediction, the process of learning to select subsets of features (or \\emph{rationales}) requires searching in the space of all possible feature combinations, which is computationally challenging and even harder when the base neural networks are not sufficiently capable. To improve the predictive performance of RE models that are based on less capable or smaller neural networks (i.e., the students), we propose \\textbf{REKD} (\\textbf{R}ationale \\textbf{E}xtraction with \\textbf{K}nowledge \\textbf{D}istillation) where a student RE model learns from the rationales and predictions of a teacher (i.e., a \\emph{rationalist}) in addition to the student's own RE optimization. This structural adjustment to RE aligns well with how humans could learn effectively from interpretable and verifiable knowledge. Because of the neural-model agnostic nature of the method, any black-box neural network could be integrated as a backbone model. To demonstrate the viability of REKD, we conduct experiments with multiple variants of BERT and vision transformer (ViT) models. Our experiments across language and vision classification datasets (i.e., IMDB movie reviews, CIFAR 10 and CIFAR 100) show that REKD significantly improves the predictive performance of the student RE models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To support training at scale, we further develop a data synthesis pipeline and construct Seeker-173K, comprising 173K high-quality tool-interaction trajectories for effective supervised and reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments show that Video-o3 substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving 72.1% accuracy on MLVU and 46.5% on Video-Holmes.

This paper aims to shed light on them. The underlying challenge is that design choices are entangled together, making their contribution to learning and generalization difficult to attribute. To address this challenge, we first construct a minimalist baseline for disentangling factors: one rollout per query in each round, the outcome reward serving as the training signal without any advantage trick, and a batch size of thirty-two. This baseline connects to batched contextual bandit learning, which facilitates experimental analysis. Centering around this baseline, we design an experiment pipeline, examining the marginal gains of factors like advantage, number of rollouts, etc. Experiments on three base models and two datasets, not only reveal new understanding on the role of various design choices on learning and generalization dynamics, but also identify critical ones that deserve more effort.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u7b80\u7ea6\u57fa\u7ebf\u6765\u89e3\u8026RL\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u5404\u56e0\u7d20\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u5f71\u54cd\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u9886\u57df\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u5173\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u8bba\u6587\uff0c\u4f46\u7ed3\u8bba\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u8fdb\u5c55\u865a\u5e7b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e24\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7b54\u6848\uff1a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u662f\u4ec0\u4e48\uff1f\u54ea\u4e9b\u662f\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff1f", "method": "\u6784\u5efa\u7b80\u7ea6\u57fa\u7ebf\uff08\u6bcf\u8f6e\u6bcf\u4e2a\u67e5\u8be2\u4e00\u6b21rollout\u3001\u4f7f\u7528\u7ed3\u679c\u5956\u52b1\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fe1\u53f7\u3001\u6279\u6b21\u5927\u5c0f32\uff09\u6765\u89e3\u8026\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u56f4\u7ed5\u8be5\u57fa\u7ebf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u68c0\u9a8c\u4f18\u52bf\u503c\u3001rollout\u6570\u91cf\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u7684\u8fb9\u9645\u6536\u76ca\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5404\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u65b0\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u8fd8\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u503c\u5f97\u66f4\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u8026\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aRL\u5fae\u8c03\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u8ba4\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u8bc1\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Open-domain video shot retrieval, which involves richer temporal structure and more complex semantics, still lacks systematic benchmarks and analysis. To fill this gap, we introduce ShotFinder, a benchmark that formalizes editing requirements as keyframe-oriented shot descriptions and introduces five types of controllable single-factor constraints: Temporal order, Color, Visual style, Audio, and Resolution. We curate 1,210 high-quality samples from YouTube across 20 thematic categories, using large models for generation with human verification. Based on the benchmark, we propose ShotFinder, a text-driven three-stage retrieval and localization pipeline: (1) query expansion via video imagination, (2) candidate video retrieval with a search engine, and (3) description-guided temporal localization. Experiments on multiple closed-source and open-source models reveal a significant gap to human performance, with clear imbalance across constraints: temporal localization is relatively tractable, while color and visual style remain major challenges. These results reveal that open-domain video shot retrieval is still a critical capability that multimodal large models have yet to overcome.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86ShotFinder\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u89c6\u9891\u955c\u5934\u68c0\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fd9\u65b9\u9762\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8868\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6587\u672c\u6216\u9759\u6001\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u7f3a\u5c11\u9488\u5bf9\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u89c6\u9891\u955c\u5934\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u57fa\u51c6\u548c\u5206\u6790\u3002\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u89c6\u9891\u955c\u5934\u68c0\u7d22\u5305\u542b\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u590d\u6742\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\u3002", "method": "1. \u6784\u5efaShotFinder\u57fa\u51c6\uff1a\u5c06\u7f16\u8f91\u9700\u6c42\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u5e27\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u955c\u5934\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e94\u79cd\u53ef\u63a7\u5355\u56e0\u7d20\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u65f6\u95f4\u987a\u5e8f\u3001\u989c\u8272\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u98ce\u683c\u3001\u97f3\u9891\u3001\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff09\u3002\u4eceYouTube\u6536\u96c61,210\u4e2a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6837\u672c\uff0c\u6db5\u76d620\u4e2a\u4e3b\u9898\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u4eba\u5de5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u30022. \u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u68c0\u7d22\u4e0e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u6269\u5c55\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u9891\u60f3\u8c61\uff09\u3001\u5019\u9009\u89c6\u9891\u68c0\u7d22\uff08\u4f7f\u7528\u641c\u7d22\u5f15\u64ce\uff09\u3001\u63cf\u8ff0\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u95ed\u6e90\u548c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8868\u73b0\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u7ea6\u675f\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\uff1a\u65f6\u95f4\u5b9a\u4f4d\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u597d\uff0c\u800c\u989c\u8272\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u98ce\u683c\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f00\u653e\u57df\u89c6\u9891\u955c\u5934\u68c0\u7d22\u662f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u5c1a\u672a\u653b\u514b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u80fd\u529b\uff0cShotFinder\u57fa\u51c6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u989c\u8272\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u98ce\u683c\u7406\u89e3\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u7684\u96be\u70b9\u3002"}}

Model-based mechanisms compute prospective action values using an internal model of the environment, supporting flexible but computationally costly planning; model-free mechanisms cache value estimates and build heuristics that enable fast, efficient habitual responding; and memory-based mechanisms allow rapid adaptation from individual experience. In this work, we aim to elucidate the computational principles underlying this biological efficiency and translate them into a sampling algorithm for scalable Bayesian inference through effective exploration of the posterior distribution. More specifically, our proposed algorithm comprises three components: a model-based module that uses the target distribution for guided but computationally slow sampling; a model-free module that uses previous samples to learn patterns in the parameter space, enabling fast, reflexive sampling without directly evaluating the expensive target distribution; and an episodic-control module that supports rapid sampling by recalling specific past events (i.e., samples). We show that this approach advances Bayesian methods and facilitates their application to large-scale statistical machine learning problems. In particular, we apply our proposed framework to Bayesian deep learning, with an emphasis on proper and principled uncertainty quantification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u591a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u7531\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u60c5\u666f\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u548c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cd\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u7531\u54cd\u5e94\u548c\u60c5\u666f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\u9ad8\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u539f\u7406\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7edf\u8ba1\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\u8fdb\u884c\u5f15\u5bfc\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u7f13\u6162\u7684\u91c7\u6837\uff1b2) \u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u7531\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u5148\u524d\u6837\u672c\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u53cd\u5c04\u5f0f\u91c7\u6837\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u76f4\u63a5\u8bc4\u4f30\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\uff1b3) \u60c5\u666f\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u56de\u5fc6\u7279\u5b9a\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff08\u5373\u6837\u672c\uff09\u652f\u6301\u5feb\u901f\u91c7\u6837\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7b97\u6cd5\u63a8\u8fdb\u4e86\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u5e76\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5176\u5728\u5927\u578b\u7edf\u8ba1\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9002\u5f53\u4e14\u6709\u539f\u5219\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4f5c\u8005\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u591a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u539f\u7406\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u63a8\u65ad\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u5177\u5907\u826f\u597d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u7531\u548c\u60c5\u666f\u63a7\u5236\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing test-time adaptation methods are computationally intensive, rely on back-propagation, and often focus on single modalities. To address these issues, we propose Training-free Test-Time Adaptation with Brownian Distance Covariance (TaTa). TaTa leverages Brownian Distance Covariance-a powerful statistical measure that captures both linear and nonlinear dependencies via pairwise distances-to dynamically adapt VLMs to new domains without training or back-propagation. This not only improves efficiency but also enhances stability by avoiding disruptive weight updates. TaTa further integrates attribute-enhanced prompting to improve vision-language inference with descriptive visual cues. Combined with dynamic clustering and pseudo-label refinement, it effectively recalibrates the model for novel visual contexts. Experiments across diverse datasets show that TaTa significantly reduces computational cost while achieving state-of-the-art performance in domain and cross-dataset generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5TaTa\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5e03\u6717\u8ddd\u79bb\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u57df\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u6743\u91cd\u66f4\u65b0", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u91cf\u5927\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u4e14\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u6a21\u6001", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5e03\u6717\u8ddd\u79bb\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\uff08\u53ef\u6355\u83b7\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u57df\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c5e\u6027\u589e\u5f3a\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u7cbe\u70bc", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u6837\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5728\u9886\u57df\u548c\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6cdb\u5316\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "TaTa\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5"}}

While recent OSOD models perform well on benchmarks, their behavior under realistic user prompting remains underexplored. In interactive XR settings, user-generated prompts are often ambiguous, underspecified, or overly detailed. To study prompt-conditioned robustness, we evaluate two OSOD models, GroundingDINO and YOLO-E, on real-world XR images and simulate diverse user prompting behaviors using vision-language models. We consider four prompt types: standard, underdetailed, overdetailed, and pragmatically ambiguous, and examine the impact of two enhancement strategies on these prompts.

Furthermore, EuGens reduce the parameter count and computational overhead while preserving the expressive power and adaptability of FFLs. We also present a layer-wise knowledge transfer technique that bypasses backpropagation, enabling efficient adaptation of EUGens to pre-trained models. Empirically, we observe that integrating EUGens into Transformers and MLPs yields substantial improvements in inference speed (up to \\textbf{27}\\%) and memory efficiency (up to \\textbf{30}\\%) across a range of tasks, including image classification, language model pre-training, and 3D scene reconstruction.

Existing federated methods frequently struggle with this data heterogeneity, typically entangling globally shared patterns with client-specific local dynamics within a single representation. In this work, we postulate that this heterogeneity stems from the entanglement of two distinct generative sources: client-specific localized dynamics and cross-client global spatial-temporal patterns. Motivated by this perspective, we introduce FedDis, a novel framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to leverage causal disentanglement for federated spatial-temporal prediction. Architecturally, FedDis comprises a dual-branch design wherein a Personalized Bank learns to capture client-specific factors, while a Global Pattern Bank distills common knowledge. This separation enables robust cross-client knowledge transfer while preserving high adaptability to unique local environments. Crucially, a mutual information minimization objective is employed to enforce informational orthogonality between the two branches, thereby ensuring effective disentanglement. Comprehensive experiments conducted on four real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedDis consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, promising efficiency, and superior expandability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we formulate the HDR reconstruction task as an optimization problem that incorporates a deep prior and subsequently unrolls it into an optimization-inspired deep neural network. The network employs a lightweight convolutional denoiser for fast inference with minimal computational overhead, effectively recovering intensity values while mitigating noise. Moreover, we introduce the Scaling Equivariance term that facilitates self-supervised fine-tuning, thereby enabling the model to adapt to new modulo images that fall outside the original training distribution.

This work proposes a non-intrusive graph-based bot detection framework for e-commerce that models user session behavior through a graph representation and applies an inductive graph neural network for classification. The approach captures both relational structure and behavioral semantics, enabling accurate identification of subtle automated activity that evades feature-based methods. Experiments on real-world e-commerce traffic demonstrate that the proposed inductive graph model outperforms a strong session-level multilayer perceptron baseline in terms of AUC and F1 score. Additional adversarial perturbation and cold-start simulations show that the model remains robust under moderate graph modifications and generalizes effectively to previously unseen sessions and URLs.

In resource-constrained settings where the rollout budget is small, accuracy often degrades. We find that noise in the shared baseline induces advantage sign flips, where some rollouts receive an incorrect advantage sign, and the update direction is reversed. To address this, we propose Median-Centered Group Relative Policy Optimization (MC-GRPO), a simple and effective solution for small-rollout training. Our main idea is to replace the mean baseline with a median baseline: the median is far less sensitive to outlier rewards than the mean, mitigating the sign flips under small rollout size (G). We generate one additional rollout for median reference (G+1), and compute advantages by using the group median. With an odd-sized group, exactly one completion is the median and receives zero advantage, we exclude this pivot rollout from backpropagation so the number of gradient-contributing samples per prompt remains G, preserving the core update cost of standard G-rollout training. Across various GRPO-family methods and a wide range of models and scales, this median-centered training consistently improves stability and final accuracy in the low-rollout regime, reducing the gap between G=2 and G=8 to within 1%.

Retraining a federated model from scratch is prohibitively expensive, motivating federated unlearning (FU). However, existing FU methods suffer from high unlearning overhead, utility degradation caused by entangled knowledge, and unintended relearning during post-unlearning recovery. In this paper, we propose FedCARE, a unified and low overhead FU framework that enables conflict-aware unlearning and relearning-resistant recovery. FedCARE leverages gradient ascent for efficient forgetting when target data are locally available and employs data free model inversion to construct class level proxies of shared knowledge. Based on these insights, FedCARE integrates a pseudo-sample generator, conflict-aware projected gradient ascent for utility preserving unlearning, and a recovery strategy that suppresses rollback toward the pre-unlearning model. FedCARE supports client, instance, and class level unlearning with modest overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and model architectures under both IID and non-IID settings show that FedCARE achieves effective forgetting, improved utility retention, and reduced relearning risk compared to state of the art FU baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

MGMT first applies Graph Transformer encoders to each graph, mapping structure and attributes into a shared latent space. It then selects task-relevant supernodes via attention and builds a meta-graph that connects functionally aligned supernodes across graphs using similarity in the latent space. Additional Graph Transformer layers on this meta-graph enable joint reasoning over intra- and inter-graph structure. The meta-graph provides built-in interpretability: supernodes and superedges highlight influential substructures and cross-graph alignments. Evaluating MGMT on both synthetic datasets and real-world neuroscience applications, we show that MGMT consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in graph-level prediction tasks while offering interpretable representations that facilitate scientific discoveries.

To address this, we propose Lethe, a novel federated unlearning method that de-correlates knowledge to be unlearned from knowledge to be retained, ensuring persistent erasure during continued training.Lethe follows a Reshape--Rectify--Restore pipeline: a temporary adapter is first trained with gradient ascent on the unlearning data to obtain magnified updates, which is then used as corrective signals to diverge layer-wise rectification on the remaining updates in two streams. Finally, the adapter is removed and a short recovery stage is performed on the retained data.

This study investigates PEFT-MuTS, a Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning framework for few-shot RUL prediction, built on cross-domain pre-trained time-series representation models. Contrary to the widely held view that knowledge transfer in RUL prediction can only occur within similar devices, we demonstrate that substantial benefits can be achieved through pre-training process with large-scale cross-domain time series datasets. A independent feature tuning network and a meta-variable-based low rank multivariate fusion mechanism are developed to enable the pre-trained univariate time-series representation backbone model to fully exploit the multivariate relationships in degradation data for downstream RUL prediction task. Additionally, we introduce a zero-initialized regressor that stabilizes the fine-tuning process under few-shot conditions. Experiments on aero-engine and industrial bearing datasets demonstrate that our method can achieve effective RUL prediction even when less than 1\\% of samples of target equipment are used.

A natural realization of this counterfactual is Leave-One-Group-Out (LOGO) retraining, which retrains the model with each group removed; however, it becomes computationally prohibitive as the number of groups grows. We propose GUDA (Group Unlearning-based Data Attribution) for diffusion models, which approximates each counterfactual model by applying machine unlearning to a shared full-data model instead of training from scratch. GUDA quantifies group influence using differences in a likelihood-based scoring rule (ELBO) between the full model and each unlearned counterfactual. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and artistic style attribution with Stable Diffusion show that GUDA identifies primary contributing groups more reliably than semantic similarity, gradient-based attribution, and instance-level unlearning approaches, while achieving x100 speedup on CIFAR-10 over LOGO retraining.", "AI": {"tldr": "GUDA\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u7ea7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5f52\u56e0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6bd4\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u5f52\u56e0\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u7fa4\u4f53\u7ea7\u522b\u5f52\u56e0\uff08\u5982\u827a\u672f\u98ce\u683c\u6216\u5bf9\u8c61\u7c7b\u522b\uff09\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7559\u4e00\u7ec4\u51fa\uff08LOGO\uff09\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u7ea7\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGUDA\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u7fa4\u4f53\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5f52\u56e0\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u6280\u672f\u4ece\u5171\u4eab\u7684\u5168\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u578b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4ece\u5934\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u5168\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u5404\u9057\u5fd8\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u7684\u4f3c\u7136\u5f97\u5206\u5dee\u5f02\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u7fa4\u4f53\u5f71\u54cd", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10\u548cStable Diffusion\u827a\u672f\u98ce\u683c\u5f52\u56e0\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cGUDA\u6bd4\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3001\u68af\u5ea6\u5f52\u56e0\u548c\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3b\u8981\u8d21\u732e\u7fa4\u4f53\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728CIFAR-10\u4e0a\u6bd4LOGO\u91cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a0\u901f100\u500d", "conclusion": "GUDA\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u7ea7\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u5f52\u56e0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8fd1\u4f3c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u5f71\u54cd\u8bc6\u522b\u80fd\u529b"}}

In this work, we propose to utilize the common-sense reasoning abilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to provide promptable representations, effectively separating controllable changes from the noise in unsupervised way. We use these representations as targets during LAM training and benchmark a wide variety of popular VLMs, revealing substantial variation in the quality of promptable representations as well as their robustness to different prompts and hyperparameters. Interestingly, we find that more recent VLMs may perform worse than older ones.

Existing methods usually have heavy inference burden or rely on external knowledge, while Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has shown potential in reducing these issues by enabling parameter-efficient tuning. However, considering directly using LoRA to alleviate the catastrophic forgetting problem is non-trivial, we introduce a novel framework that restructures a single LoRA module as a decomposable Rank-1 Expert Pool. Our method learns to dynamically compose a sparse, task-specific update by selecting from this expert pool, guided by the semantics of the [CLS] token. In addition, we propose an Activation-Guided Orthogonal (AGO) loss that orthogonalizes critical parts of LoRA weights across tasks. This sparse composition and orthogonalization enable fewer parameter updates, resulting in domain-aware learning while minimizing inter-task interference and maintaining downstream task performance.

However, a fundamental limitation of this paradigm is the rigid structural coupling of model capacity to computational cost: expanding a model's parametric memory -- its repository of factual knowledge or visual patterns -- traditionally requires deepening or widening the network, which incurs a proportional rise in active FLOPs. In this work, we introduce $\\textbf{MoVE (Mixture of Value Embeddings)}$, a mechanism that breaks this coupling and establishes a new axis for scaling capacity. MoVE decouples memory from compute by introducing a global bank of learnable value embeddings shared across all attention layers. For every step in the sequence, the model employs a differentiable soft gating mechanism to dynamically mix retrieved concepts from this bank into the standard value projection. This architecture allows parametric memory to be scaled independently of network depth by simply increasing the number of embedding slots. We validate MoVE through strictly controlled experiments on two representative applications of autoregressive modeling: Text Generation and Image Generation. In both domains, MoVE yields consistent performance improvements over standard and layer-wise memory baselines, enabling the construction of \"memory-dense\" models that achieve lower perplexity and higher fidelity than their dense counterparts at comparable compute budgets.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Periodicity generalization represents a model's ability to extract periodic patterns from training data and generalize to OOD scenarios. We introduce a unified interpretation of periodicity from the perspective of abstract algebra and reasoning, including both single and composite periodicity, to explain why Transformers struggle to generalize periodicity.

We have recently proposed the METRIC-framework for systematically evaluating the suitability (fit-for-purpose) of data for medical ML for a given task.

Furthermore, we discuss strategies and provide decision trees for choosing an appropriate set of data quality metrics from the metric library given specific use cases.

Further, we introduce LoRAFactory, a modular codebase that implements variants through a unified interface, supporting plug-and-play experimentation and fine-grained analysis. Last, using this codebase, we conduct a large-scale evaluation across natural language generation, natural language understanding, and image classification tasks, systematically exploring key hyperparameters.

In this work, we demonstrate that element-wise quantization can be made as efficient as block-wise scaling while providing strictly superior expressive power by modeling the scaling manifold as continuous low-rank matrices ($S = BA$). We propose Low-Rank Decomposed Scaling (LoRDS), a unified framework that rethinks quantization granularity through this low-rank decomposition. By \"breaking the blocks\" of spatial constraints, LoRDS establishes a seamless efficiency lifecycle: it provides high-fidelity PTQ initialization refined via iterative optimization, enables joint QAT of weights and scaling factors, and facilitates high-rank multiplicative PEFT adaptation. Unlike additive PEFT approaches such as QLoRA, LoRDS enables high-rank weight updates within a low-rank budget while incurring no additional inference overhead. Supported by highly optimized Triton kernels, LoRDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across various model families in both quantization and downstream fine-tuning tasks. Notably, on Llama3-8B, our method achieves up to a 27.0% accuracy improvement at 3 bits over NormalFloat quantization and delivers a 1.5x inference speedup on NVIDIA RTX 4090 while enhancing PEFT performance by 9.6% on downstream tasks over 4bit QLoRA, offering a robust and integrated solution for unified compression and adaptation of LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we show that models with stronger generalization also align more strongly with human neural activity. Moreover, generalization performance, model--model alignment, and model--brain alignment are all significantly correlated with each other. We further show that these relationships can be explained by a single geometric property of learned representations: the local intrinsic dimension of embeddings. Lower local dimension is consistently associated with stronger model--model alignment, stronger model--brain alignment, and better generalization, whereas global dimension measures fail to capture these effects. Finally, we find that increasing model capacity and training data scale systematically reduces local intrinsic dimension, providing a geometric account of the benefits of scaling.

A Principled Analysis of Softmax-family Loss", "comment": "34 pages, 3 figures", "summary": "The Softmax loss is one of the most widely employed surrogate objectives for classification and ranking tasks. To elucidate its theoretical properties, the Fenchel-Young framework situates it as a canonical instance within a broad family of surrogates. Concurrently, another line of research has addressed scalability when the number of classes is exceedingly large, in which numerous approximations have been proposed to retain the benefits of the exact objective while improving efficiency. Building on these two perspectives, we present a principled investigation of the Softmax-family losses. We examine whether different surrogates achieve consistency with classification and ranking metrics, and analyze their gradient dynamics to reveal distinct convergence behaviors.

Guided by this metric, we propose Sombrero, which steers boundary placement toward predictive difficulty via a confidence-alignment boundary loss and stabilizes boundary learning by applying confidence-weighted smoothing at the input level rather than on realized chunks. On 1B scale, across UTF-8 corpora covering English and German text as well as code and mathematical content, Sombrero improves the accuracy-efficiency trade-off and yields boundaries that more consistently align compute with hard-to-predict positions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Generalizing the geometric intuition of linear kernels to the high-dimensional latent space of LLMs, we formally define the ``Obfuscated Semantic Null Space'', a high-dimensional regime that preserves semantic fidelity while enforcing near-orthogonality to the original embedding. By injecting perturbations that project the original embedding into this space, OSNIP ensures privacy without any post-processing. Furthermore, OSNIP employs a key-dependent stochastic mapping that synthesizes individualized perturbation trajectories unique to each user.

However, existing medication recommender methods often struggle with a user (i.e., patient) cold-start problem, where recommendations for new patients are usually unreliable due to the lack of sufficient prescription history for patient profiling. While prior studies have utilized medical knowledge graphs to connect medication concepts through pharmacological or chemical relationships, these methods primarily focus on mitigating the item cold-start issue and fall short in providing personalized recommendations that adapt to individual patient characteristics. Meta-learning has shown promise in handling new users with sparse interactions in recommender systems. However, its application to EHRs remains underexplored due to the unique sequential structure of EHR data. To tackle these challenges, we propose MetaDrug, a multi-level, uncertainty-aware meta-learning framework designed to address the patient cold-start problem in medication recommendation. MetaDrug proposes a novel two-level meta-adaptation mechanism, including self-adaptation, which adapts the model to new patients using their own medical events as support sets to capture temporal dependencies; and peer-adaptation, which adapts the model using similar visits from peer patients to enrich new patient representations. Meanwhile, to further improve meta-adaptation outcomes, we introduce an uncertainty quantification module that ranks the support visits and filters out the unrelated information for adaptation consistency. We evaluate our approach on the MIMIC-III and Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) datasets. Experimental results on both datasets demonstrate that MetaDrug consistently outperforms state-of-the-art medication recommendation methods on cold-start patients.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We study generalization from a representation-centric perspective and analyze how the geometry of learned embeddings controls predictive performance for a fixed trained model. We show that population risk can be bounded by two factors: (i) the intrinsic dimension of the embedding distribution, which determines the convergence rate of empirical embedding distribution to the population distribution in Wasserstein distance, and (ii) the sensitivity of the downstream mapping from embeddings to predictions, characterized by Lipschitz constants. Together, these yield an embedding-dependent error bound that does not rely on parameter counts or hypothesis class complexity. At the final embedding layer, architectural sensitivity vanishes and the bound is dominated by embedding dimension, explaining its strong empirical correlation with generalization performance.

To address these challenges, we propose a unified definition of behavior style and instantiate it into a practical framework.

However, a kernel-theoretic understanding of sparse attention mechanisms is currently missing. In this paper, we establish a formal correspondence between sparse attention and compact (bounded support) kernels. We show that normalized ReLU and sparsemax attention arise from Epanechnikov kernel regression under fixed and adaptive normalizations, respectively. More generally, we demonstrate that widely used kernels in nonparametric density estimation -- including Epanechnikov, biweight, and triweight -- correspond to $\u03b1$-entmax attention with $\u03b1= 1 + \\frac{1}{n}$ for $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, while the softmax/Gaussian relationship emerges in the limit $n \\to \\infty$. This unified perspective explains how sparsity naturally emerges from kernel design and provides principled alternatives to heuristic top-$k$ attention and other associative memory mechanisms.

In this paper, improve the state of the art for quantized training in NVFP4 via a novel unbiased quantization routine for micro-scaled formats, called MS-EDEN, that has more than 2x lower quantization error than SR.

We first generate a low-resolution version of a tabular data row, that is, the collection of the purely categorical features and a coarse categorical representation of numerical features. Next, this information is leveraged in the high-resolution flow matching model via a novel guided conditional probability path and data-dependent coupling. The low-resolution representation of numerical features explicitly accounts for discrete outcomes, such as missing or inflated values, and therewith enables a more faithful generation of mixed-type features.

By analyzing the non-normal dynamics of the Sinkhorn fixed-point map, we reveal a theoretical \\textbf{thermodynamic speed limit}. Under standard exponential cooling, the shift in the target posterior ($O(1)$) outpaces the contraction rate of the inference operator, which degrades as $O(1/\u03b5)$.

To address this, we propose \\textbf{Efficient PH-ASC}, an adaptive scheduling algorithm that monitors the stability of the inference process. By enforcing a linear stability law, we decouple expensive spectral diagnostics from the training loop, reducing overhead from $O(N^3)$ to amortized $O(1)$.

However, we identify a discrepancy between the implicit semantic structure induced by different modality embeddings and the explicit graph structure. For instance, neighbors in the explicit graph structure may be close in one modality but distant in another. Since existing methods typically perform message passing over the fixed explicit graph structure, they inadvertently aggregate dissimilar features, introducing modality-specific noise and impeding effective node representation learning. To address this, we propose OptiMAG, an Unbalanced Optimal Transport-based regularization framework. OptiMAG employs the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance to explicitly guide cross-modal structural consistency within local neighborhoods, effectively mitigating structural-semantic conflicts. Moreover, a KL divergence penalty enables adaptive handling of cross-modal inconsistencies. This framework can be seamlessly integrated into existing multimodal graph models, acting as an effective drop-in regularizer. Experiments demonstrate that OptiMAG consistently outperforms baselines across multiple tasks, ranging from graph-centric tasks (e.g., node classification, link prediction) to multimodal-centric generation tasks (e.g., graph2text, graph2image).

While recent graph generation methods employ generative adversarial network (GAN) frameworks to handle permutation invariance and irregular topologies, they typically rely on random edge sampling with fixed probabilities, limiting their capacity to capture complex structural dependencies between nodes. We propose a density-aware conditional graph generation framework using Wasserstein GANs (WGAN) that replaces random sampling with a learnable distance-based edge predictor. Our approach embeds nodes into a latent space where proximity correlates with edge likelihood, enabling the generator to learn meaningful connectivity patterns. A differentiable edge predictor determines pairwise relationships directly from node embeddings, while a density-aware selection mechanism adaptively controls edge density to match class-specific sparsity distributions observed in real graphs. We train the model using a WGAN with gradient penalty, employing a GCN-based critic to ensure generated graphs exhibit realistic topology and align with target class distributions. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method produces graphs with superior structural coherence and class-consistent connectivity compared to existing baselines. The learned edge predictor captures complex relational patterns beyond simple heuristics, generating graphs whose density and topology closely match real structural distributions. Our results show improved training stability and controllable synthesis, making the framework effective for realistic graph generation and data augmentation.

In this paper, we propose Matterhorn, a spiking transformer that integrates a novel masked time-to-first-spike (M-TTFS) encoding method to reduce spike movement and a memristive synapse unit (MSU) to eliminate weight access overhead. M-TTFS employs a masking strategy that reassigns the zero-energy silent state (a spike train of all 0s) to the most frequent membrane potential rather than the lowest. This aligns the coding scheme with the data distribution, minimizing spike movement energy without information loss. We further propose a `dead zone' strategy that maximizes sparsity by mapping all values within a given range to the silent state. At the hardware level, the MSU utilizes compute-in-memory (CIM) technology to perform analog integration directly within memory, effectively removing weight access costs. On the GLUE benchmark, Matterhorn establishes a new state-of-the-art, surpassing existing SNNs by 1.42% in average accuracy while delivering a 2.31 times improvement in energy efficiency.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, access to high-quality datasets is often limited due to privacy concerns, acquisition costs, and labeling challenges. Synthetic time series generation has emerged as a promising solution to address these constraints. In this work, we present a framework for generating synthetic time series by leveraging complex networks mappings. Specifically, we investigate whether time series transformed into Quantile Graphs (QG) -- and then reconstructed via inverse mapping -- can produce synthetic data that preserve the statistical and structural properties of the original. We evaluate the fidelity and utility of the generated data using both simulated and real-world datasets, and compare our approach against state-of-the-art Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) methods.

Shapley values are a widely used approach for explaining model predictions, but require direct access to the underlying model, an assumption frequently violated in real-world deployments. Further, even when model access is possible, their exact computation may be prohibitively expensive. We investigate whether meaningful Shapley value estimations can be obtained in a zero-shot setting, using only the input data distribution and no evaluations of the target model. To this end, we introduce ExplainerPFN, a tabular foundation model built on TabPFN that is pretrained on synthetic datasets generated from random structural causal models and supervised using exact or near-exact Shapley values. Once trained, ExplainerPFN predicts feature attributions for unseen tabular datasets without model access, gradients, or example explanations.\n  Our contributions are fourfold: (1) we show that few-shot learning-based explanations can achieve high fidelity to SHAP values with as few as two reference observations; (2) we propose ExplainerPFN, the first zero-shot method for estimating Shapley values without access to the underlying model or reference explanations; (3) we provide an open-source implementation of ExplainerPFN, including the full training pipeline and synthetic data generator; and (4) through extensive experiments on real and synthetic datasets, we show that ExplainerPFN achieves performance competitive with few-shot surrogate explainers that rely on 2-10 SHAP examples.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this work, we uncover a counter-intuitive optimization anomaly: models trained on short horizons-when coupled with our proposed Evolutionary Forecasting (EF) paradigm-significantly outperform those trained directly on long horizons. We attribute this success to the mitigation of a fundamental optimization pathology inherent in DF, where conflicting gradients from distant futures cripple the learning of local dynamics. We establish EF as a unified generative framework, proving that DF is merely a degenerate special case of EF. Extensive experiments demonstrate that a singular EF model surpasses task-specific DF ensembles across standard benchmarks and exhibits robust asymptotic stability in extreme extrapolation.

While existing approaches to LTL-guided multi-task RL demonstrate successful generalization across LTL specifications, they are unable to generalize to unseen vocabularies of propositions (or \"symbols\"), which describe high-level events in LTL. We present PlatoLTL, a novel approach that enables policies to zero-shot generalize not only compositionally across LTL formula structures, but also parametrically across propositions. We achieve this by treating propositions as instances of parameterized predicates rather than discrete symbols, allowing policies to learn shared structure across related propositions.

Reinforcement learning can help address this challenge by learning medication dosing policies from retrospective data. However, prior work on sedation and analgesia has optimized for objectives that do not value patient survival while relying on algorithms unsuitable for imperfect information settings. We investigated the risks of these design choices by implementing a deep reinforcement learning framework to suggest hourly medication doses under partial observability. Using data from 47,144 ICU stays in the MIMIC-IV database, we trained policies to prescribe opioids, propofol, benzodiazepines, and dexmedetomidine according to two goals: reduce pain or jointly reduce pain and mortality. We found that, although the two policies were associated with lower pain, actions from the first policy were positively correlated with mortality, while those proposed by the second policy were negatively correlated. This suggests that valuing long-term outcomes could be critical for safer treatment policies, even if a short-term goal remains the primary objective.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790ICU\u75bc\u75db\u7ba1\u7406\u4e2d\u4e0d\u540c\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u4ec5\u51cf\u5c11\u75bc\u75dbvs\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u75bc\u75db\u548c\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\uff09\u5bf9\u836f\u7269\u6cbb\u7597\u653f\u7b56\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u77ed\u671f\u75bc\u75db\u7f13\u89e3\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u4e0e\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u517c\u987e\u957f\u671f\u751f\u5b58\u7684\u653f\u7b56\u4e0e\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173", "motivation": "ICU\u75bc\u75db\u7ba1\u7406\u9700\u8981\u5728\u6cbb\u7597\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u60a3\u8005\u5b89\u5168\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u590d\u6742\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u672a\u5145\u5206\u8003\u8651\u957f\u671f\u751f\u5b58\u76ee\u6807\u4e14\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u76ee\u6807\u8bbe\u5b9a\u5bf9\u836f\u7269\u6cbb\u7597\u653f\u7b56\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u57fa\u4e8eMIMIC-IV\u6570\u636e\u5e93\u768447,144\u4e2aICU\u4f4f\u9662\u8bb0\u5f55\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u653f\u7b56\u4ee5\u5c0f\u65f6\u4e3a\u5355\u4f4d\u5f00\u5177\u963f\u7247\u7c7b\u836f\u7269\u3001\u4e19\u6cca\u915a\u3001\u82ef\u4e8c\u6c2e\u44ec\u7c7b\u548c\u53f3\u7f8e\u6258\u54aa\u5b9a\u7684\u5242\u91cf\uff0c\u6309\u7167\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u4ec5\u51cf\u5c11\u75bc\u75dbvs\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u75bc\u75db\u548c\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u4e2a\u653f\u7b56\u90fd\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u75bc\u75db\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u51cf\u5c11\u75bc\u75db\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u653f\u7b56\u4e0e\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u5448\u6b63\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u800c\u540c\u65f6\u5173\u6ce8\u75bc\u75db\u548c\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u7684\u7b2c\u4e8c\u653f\u7b56\u4e0e\u6b7b\u4ea1\u7387\u5448\u8d1f\u76f8\u5173", "conclusion": "\u5373\u4f7f\u4e3b\u8981\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u77ed\u671f\u75bc\u75db\u7f13\u89e3\uff0c\u91cd\u89c6\u957f\u671f\u7ed3\u679c\uff08\u5982\u751f\u5b58\u7387\uff09\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5236\u5b9a\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u6cbb\u7597\u653f\u7b56\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u8fd9\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u907f\u514d\u4ec5\u4f18\u5316\u77ed\u671f\u76ee\u6807\u53ef\u80fd\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u610f\u5916\u98ce\u9669"}}

Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has thus become a mainstream paradigm. Among them, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) introduces trainable low-rank matrices and shows strong performance, nevertheless, its fixed-rank design limits flexibility. Dynamic rank allocation methods mitigate this issue by pruning redundant directions; however, they often rely on heuristic, element-level metrics that globally sort rank directions without matrix-wise distinction, and they lack mechanisms to expand capacity in layers requiring additional adaptation. To overcome these limitations, we propose FlexLoRA, an entropy-guided flexible low-rank adaptation framework that (i) evaluates matrix importance via spectral energy entropy, (ii) supports rank pruning and expansion under a global budget, and (iii) employs zero-impact initialization for newly added singular directions to ensure stability. By addressing granularity, flexibility, and stability limitations, FlexLoRA provides a more principled solution for PEFT.

However, it remains unclear how accuracy and decision commitment evolve along a reasoning trajectory, and whether intermediate trace segments provide answer-relevant information beyond generic length or stylistic effects. Here, we propose a protocol to systematically probe the trajectories of reasoning traces in LLMs by 1) generating a model's reasoning trace, 2) truncating it at fixed token-percentiles, and 3) injecting each partial trace back into the model (or a different model) to measure the induced distribution over answer choices via next-token probabilities. We apply this protocol to the open-source Qwen3-4B/-8B/-14B and gpt-oss-20b/-120b models across the multiple-choice GPQA Diamond and MMLU-Pro benchmarks. We find that accuracy and decision commitment consistently increase as the percentage of provided reasoning tokens grows. These gains are primarily driven by relevant content in the model generation rather than context length or generic \"reasoning style\" effects. Stronger models often backtrack successfully from incorrect partial traces, but immediate answers often remain anchored in the weaker model's incorrect response.

Experiments across regression, tabular, time-series, and image classification benchmarks under mixed distribution shifts demonstrate consistent improvements in both worst-environment and average OOD performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although this notion has been extended to linear bandits, existing results suffer from suboptimality in ambient dimension $d$, stemming from proof techniques that rely on restrictive concentration inequalities. In this work, we resolve this open problem by introducing new analytical tools that yield an order-optimal Nash regret bound in linear bandits. Beyond Nash regret, we initiate the study of $p$-means regret in linear bandits, a unifying framework that interpolates between fairness and utility objectives and strictly generalizes Nash regret. We propose a generic algorithmic framework, FairLinBandit, that works as a meta-algorithm on top of any linear bandit strategy. We instantiate this framework using two bandit algorithms: Phased Elimination and Upper Confidence Bound, and prove that both achieve sublinear $p$-means regret for the entire range of $p$. Extensive experiments on linear bandit instances generated from real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently outperform the existing state-of-the-art baseline.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Batley", "Sourav Saha"], "title": "Agile Reinforcement Learning through Separable Neural Architecture", "comment": null, "summary": "Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly deployed in resource-constrained environments, yet the go-to function approximators - multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) - are often parameter-inefficient due to an imperfect inductive bias for the smooth structure of many value functions. This mismatch can also hinder sample efficiency and slow policy learning in this capacity-limited regime. Although model compression techniques exist, they operate post-hoc and do not improve learning efficiency. Recent spline-based separable architectures - such as Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) - have been shown to offer parameter efficiency but are widely reported to exhibit significant computational overhead, especially at scale.\n  In seeking to address these limitations, this work introduces SPAN (SPline-based Adaptive Networks), a novel function approximation approach to RL. SPAN adapts the low rank KHRONOS framework by integrating a learnable preprocessing layer with a separable tensor product B-spline basis. SPAN is evaluated across discrete (PPO) and high-dimensional continuous (SAC) control tasks, as well as offline settings (Minari/D4RL). Empirical results demonstrate that SPAN achieves a 30-50% improvement in sample efficiency and 1.3-9 times higher success rates across benchmarks compared to MLP baselines. Furthermore, SPAN demonstrates superior anytime performance and robustness to hyperparameter variations, suggesting it as a viable, high performance alternative for learning intrinsically efficient policies in resource-limited settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A promising direction to further improve post-pruning performance is weight permutation, which reorders model weights into patterns more amenable to pruning. However, the exponential growth of the permutation search space with the scale of Transformer architectures forces most methods to rely on greedy or heuristic algorithms, limiting the effectiveness of reordering.\n  In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end learnable permutation framework. Our method introduces a learnable permutation cost matrix to quantify the cost of swapping any two input channels of a given weight matrix, a differentiable bipartite matching solver to obtain the optimal binary permutation matrix given a cost matrix, and a sparsity optimization loss function to directly optimize the permutation operator.

While an ideal conditional predictor would be invariant to this order, practical dLLMs exhibit strong sensitivity to the unmasking order, creating a new channel for watermarking. dgMARK steers the unmasking order toward positions whose high-reward candidate tokens satisfy a simple parity constraint induced by a binary hash, without explicitly reweighting the model's learned probabilities. The method is plug-and-play with common decoding strategies (e.g., confidence, entropy, and margin-based ordering) and can be strengthened with a one-step lookahead variant. Watermarks are detected via elevated parity-matching statistics, and a sliding-window detector ensures robustness under post-editing operations including insertion, deletion, substitution, and paraphrasing.", "AI": {"tldr": "dgMARK\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u5f15\u5bfc\u6c34\u5370\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u89e3\u63a9\u7801\u987a\u5e8f\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u690d\u5165\u6c34\u5370\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\u4e14\u80fd\u62b5\u6297\u591a\u79cd\u6587\u672c\u7f16\u8f91\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08dLLMs\uff09\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u4efb\u610f\u987a\u5e8f\u751f\u6210\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u5b9e\u9645\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u89e3\u63a9\u7801\u987a\u5e8f\u5177\u6709\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u6c34\u5370\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u901a\u9053\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u54c8\u5e0c\u5f15\u5165\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u5947\u5076\u7ea6\u675f\u5f15\u5bfc\u89e3\u63a9\u7801\u987a\u5e8f\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u9ad8\u5956\u52b1\u5019\u9009\u4ee4\u724c\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u663e\u5f0f\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\u6a21\u578b\u6982\u7387\uff1b\u652f\u6301\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3001\u71b5\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u503c\u7b49\u591a\u79cd\u89e3\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u6b65\u524d\u77bb\u53d8\u4f53\u589e\u5f3a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u6c34\u5370\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u5947\u5076\u5339\u914d\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u6ed1\u52a8\u7a97\u53e3\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u786e\u4fdd\u5bf9\u63d2\u5165\u3001\u5220\u9664\u3001\u66ff\u6362\u548c\u6539\u5199\u7b49\u7f16\u8f91\u64cd\u4f5c\u5177\u6709\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "dgMARK\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6c34\u5370\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u53ef\u68c0\u6d4b\u8ddf\u8e2a\u3002"}}

However, existing training paradigms remain constrained: agents often traverse long-horizon sequences of memory operations before receiving sparse and delayed rewards, which hinders truly end-to-end optimization of memory management policies. To address this limitation, we introduce Mem-T, an autonomous memory agent that interfaces with a lightweight hierarchical memory database to perform dynamic updates and multi-turn retrieval over streaming inputs. To effectively train long-horizon memory management capabilities, we further propose MoT-GRPO, a tree-guided reinforcement learning framework that transforms sparse terminal feedback into dense, step-wise supervision via memory operation tree backpropagation and hindsight credit assignment, thereby enabling the joint optimization of memory construction and retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mem-T is (1) high-performing, surpassing frameworks such as A-Mem and Mem0 by up to $14.92\\%$, and (2) economical, operating on a favorable accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier and reducing inference tokens per query by $\\sim24.45\\%$ relative to GAM without sacrificing performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While measurement errors can often be safely corrected, mechanistic anomalies require careful consideration. We define a causal model that explicitly captures both types by treating outliers as latent interventions on latent (\"true\") and observed (\"measured\") variables.

However, LLM generation is highly sequential, and long CoTs lead to a high latency. We propose to train Divide-and-Conquer CoT (DC-CoT) to reduce the latency. With DC-CoT, the model can act as a director that identifies distinct subtasks that can be performed in parallel in its reasoning process, and then spawns workers to execute the subtasks. Our goal is to achieve high accuracy, with a low longest path length, which is a theoretical measure of the latency needed for the response. We start with a long CoT base model (DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview), and first use SFT with a small curated demonstration set to initialize its ability to spawn workers in a certain format. Because SFT degrades the accuracy significantly, we design a multi-stage RL algorithm, with various data filtering strategies, to recover the accuracy while decreasing the longest path length. Across several benchmarks including AIME 2024 and HMMT 2025, DC-CoT achieves similar accuracy as DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview while decreasing longest path length by 35-40%.

Constructing unified paths that satisfy multi-marginal constraints across observations is challenging, since na\u00efve higher-order polynomials tend to be unstable and oscillatory. We introduce SplineFlow, a theoretically grounded flow matching algorithm that jointly models conditional paths across observations via B-spline interpolation.

Comprehensive experiments across various deterministic and stochastic dynamical systems of varying complexity, as well as on cellular trajectory inference tasks, demonstrate the strong improvement of SplineFlow over existing baselines.

Recent work offers a rigorous solution using conformal prediction in a full ranking scenario, which aims to construct prediction sets for the absolute ranks of test items based on the relative ranks of calibration items. However, relying on upper bounds of non-conformity scores renders the method overly conservative, resulting in substantially large prediction sets. To address this, we propose Distribution-informed Conformal Ranking (DCR), which produces efficient prediction sets by deriving the exact distribution of non-conformity scores. In particular, we find that the absolute ranks of calibration items follow Negative Hypergeometric distributions, conditional on their relative ranks.

The resulting hierarchy captures both low-level behaviours and their composition into higher-level skills. We evaluate our approach in high-dimensional, pixel-based environments, including Craftax and the full, unmodified version of Minecraft.

Vehicular traffic has been identified as a major contributor to poor air quality. In a lot of cities the publicly available air quality measurements and forecasts are coarse-grained both in space and time. However, in general, real-time traffic intensity data is openly available in various forms and is fine-grained. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of pollution sensor measurements combined with traffic data from Mexico City. We analyse and model the relationship between traffic intensity and air quality with the aim to provide hyper-local, dynamic air quality forecasts. We developed an innovative method to represent traffic intensities by transforming simple colour-coded traffic maps into concentric ring-based descriptions, enabling improved characterisation of traffic conditions.

Aggregating subjective labels, though, may amplify individual biases, particularly regarding sensitive features, raising fairness concerns. Nonetheless, fairness in crowdsourced aggregation remains largely unexplored, with no existing convergence guarantees and only limited post-processing approaches for enforcing $\\varepsilon$-fairness under demographic parity. We address this gap by analyzing the fairness s of crowdsourced aggregation methods within the $\\varepsilon$-fairness framework, for Majority Vote and Optimal Bayesian aggregation. In the small-crowd regime, we derive an upper bound on the fairness gap of Majority Vote in terms of the fairness gaps of the individual annotators. We further show that the fairness gap of the aggregated consensus converges exponentially fast to that of the ground-truth under interpretable conditions. Since ground-truth itself may still be unfair, we generalize a state-of-the-art multiclass fairness post-processing algorithm from the continuous to the discrete setting, which enforces strict demographic parity constraints to any aggregation rule.

Existing temporal graph neural networks mainly focus on learning representations of historical interactions. Despite their strong performance, these models are still purely discriminative, producing point estimates for future links and lacking an explicit mechanism to capture the uncertainty and sequential structure of future temporal interactions. In this paper, we propose SDG, a novel sequence-level diffusion framework that unifies dynamic graph learning with generative denoising. Specifically, SDG injects noise into the entire historical interaction sequence and jointly reconstructs all interaction embeddings through a conditional denoising process, thereby enabling the model to capture more comprehensive interaction distributions. To align the generative process with temporal link prediction, we employ a cross-attention denoising decoder to guide the reconstruction of the destination sequence and optimize the model in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on various temporal graph benchmarks show that SDG consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in the temporal link prediction task.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We further observe a strong correlation between attention-derived token importance and token-wise decoding probability. Based on this insight, we propose FOCUS -- an inference system designed for DLLMs. By dynamically focusing computation on decodable tokens and evicting non-decodable ones on-the-fly, FOCUS increases the effective batch size, alleviating compute limitations and enabling scalable throughput. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FOCUS achieves up to 3.52$\\times$ throughput improvement over the production-grade engine LMDeploy, while preserving or improving generation quality across multiple benchmarks.

This decoupling enables superior data efficiency and effective physics-informed learning, while naturally supporting Decoupled Annealing Posterior Sampling (DAPS) to avoid over-smoothing in Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS). Theoretically, we prove that DDIS avoids the guidance attenuation failure of joint models when training data is scarce.
