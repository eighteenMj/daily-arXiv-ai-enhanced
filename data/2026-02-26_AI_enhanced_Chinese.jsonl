This makes training and particularly fine-tuning of machine-learned codecs on this metric interesting. However, VMAF is shown to be attackable in a way that, e.g., unsharpening an image can lead to a gain in VMAF quality while decreasing the quality in human perception. A particular version of VMAF called VMAF NEG has been designed to be more robust against such attacks and therefore it should be more useful for fine-tuning of codecs. In this paper, our contributions are threefold. First, we identify and analyze the still existing vulnerability of VMAF NEG towards attacks, particulary towards the attack that consists in employing VMAF NEG for image codec fine-tuning. Second, to benefit from VMAF NEG's high correlation with human perception, we propose a robust loss including VMAF NEG for fine-tuning either the encoder or the decoder.

However, routine acquisition of multi-tracer PET is limited by high costs, radiation exposure, and restricted tracer availability. Recent efforts have explored deep learning approaches for synthesizing PET images from structural MRI. While some methods rely solely on T1-weighted MRI, others incorporate additional sequences such as T2-FLAIR to improve pathological sensitivity. However, existing methods often struggle to capture fine-grained anatomical and pathological details, resulting in artifacts and unrealistic outputs. To this end, we propose RelA-Diffusion, a Relativistic Adversarial Diffusion framework for multi-tracer PET synthesis from multi-sequence MRI. By leveraging both T1-weighted and T2-FLAIR scans as complementary inputs, RelA-Diffusion captures richer structural information to guide image generation. To improve synthesis fidelity, we introduce a gradient-penalized relativistic adversarial loss to the intermediate clean predictions of the diffusion model. This loss compares real and generated images in a relative manner, encouraging the synthesis of more realistic local structures. Both the relativistic formulation and the gradient penalty contribute to stabilizing the training, while adversarial feedback at each diffusion timestep enables consistent refinement throughout the generation process. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate that RelA-Diffusion outperforms existing methods in both visual fidelity and quantitative metrics, highlighting its potential for accurate synthesis of multi-tracer PET.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u591a\u793a\u8e2a\u5242PET\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5RelA-Diffusion\uff0c\u5229\u7528T1\u52a0\u6743\u548cT2-FLAIR MRI\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u591a\u793a\u8e2a\u5242PET\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u793a\u8e2a\u5242PET\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u795e\u7ecf\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u8fc7\u7a0b\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u8f90\u5c04\u66b4\u9732\u548c\u793a\u8e2a\u5242\u53ef\u7528\u6027\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u5176\u5e38\u89c4\u91c7\u96c6\u53d7\u5230\u9650\u5236\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6355\u6349\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u89e3\u5256\u548c\u75c5\u7406\u7ec6\u8282\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4f2a\u5f71\u548c\u4e0d\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86RelA-Diffusion\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u5bf9\u6297\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528T1\u52a0\u6743\u548cT2-FLAIR MRI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e92\u8865\u8f93\u5165\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u68af\u5ea6\u60e9\u7f5a\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bba\u5bf9\u6297\u635f\u5931\u5230\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u5bf9\u6bd4\u8f83\u771f\u5b9e\u548c\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5c40\u90e8\u7ed3\u6784\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRelA-Diffusion\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u90fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "RelA-Diffusion\u80fd\u591f\u51c6\u786e\u5408\u6210\u591a\u793a\u8e2a\u5242PET\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u795e\u7ecf\u5b66\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u6210\u672c\u548c\u8f90\u5c04\u66b4\u9732\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

In the perspective of information, twin-image super-resolution (TISR) is regarded as the most challenging MISR scenario, having crucial applications like the SPOT-5 supermode imaging. In TISR, an image is super-resolved by its subpixel-shift counterpart (i.e., twin image), where the two images are typically offset by half a pixel both horizontally and vertically. We formulate the less investigated TISR using a convex criterion, which is implemented using a novel deep unfolding network. In the unfolding, an embedded simple shift operator trickily addresses the coupled TISR data-fitting terms, and a transformer trained with a convex self-similarity loss function elegantly implements the proximal mapping induced by the TISR regularizer. The proposed convex self-similarity unfolding supermode super-resolution (COSUP) algorithm is interpretable and achieves state-of-the-art performance with very fast millisecond-level computational time. COSUP is also tested on real-world data, for which the subpixel shifts would not be spatially uniform, with results showing great superiority over the official CNES supermode imaging product in terms of credible metrics (e.g., natural image quality evaluator, NIQE).

A fundamental challenge in these tasks is the uncertainties when operating in space, e.g., in measurements of satellites' states, which can make future states difficult to predict. Another challenge is that satellites' onboard processors are typically much slower than their terrestrial counterparts. Therefore, to address these challenges we propose to solve an ARPOD problem with feedback optimization, which computes inputs to a system by measuring its outputs, feeding them into an optimization algorithm in the loop, and computing some number of iterations towards an optimal input. We focus on satellite rendezvous, and satellites' dynamics are modeled using the continuous-time Clohessy-Wiltshire equations, which are marginally stable. We develop an asymptotically stabilizing controller for them, and we use discrete-time gradient descent in the loop to compute inputs to them. Then, we analyze the hybrid feedback optimization system formed by the stabilized Clohessy-Wiltshire equations with gradient descent in the loop. We show that this model is well-posed and that maximal solutions are both complete and non-Zeno. Then, we show that solutions converge exponentially fast to a ball around a rendezvous point, and we bound the radius of that ball in terms of system parameters.

In traditional wireless systems, signals propagate through the air, where they are vulnerable to interference, attenuation, and jamming. Guided communication, in contrast, confines signals within a physical medium, significantly reducing interference and supporting higher data rates over longer distances. Guided wireless technology harnesses these benefits by creating guided wireless channels and offering a controlled pathway for electromagnetic waves. This work harnesses these benefits by focusing on the modeling of near-field communication through long connected arrays deployed in linear-cell environments. We derive a circuit model for long array as an infinitely long dipole with multiple periodic feed points before approximating it with a finite array through open circuiting. Through our simulations, we show how the standing wave phenomenon is confirmed by the oscillations in spectral efficiency. We also demonstrate the capability of the LMMSE transmit beamformer in mitigating interference and minimizing the mean square error by adaptively allocating more power to the user experiencing the most severe channel attenuation, resulting in a more balanced variation of achievable rates across users.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In our set-up, the sensor measurements are considered to be private and are jointly correlated with an underlying process. A fusion center combines the private sensor measurements and releases its output to an honest-but-curious party, which is responsible for estimating the state of the underlying process based on the fusion center's output. The privacy leakage incurred by the fusion policy is quantified using R\u00e9nyi differential privacy. We formulate the privacy-aware fusion design as a constrained finite-horizon optimization problem, in which the fusion policy and the state estimation are jointly optimized to minimize the state estimation error subject to a total privacy budget constraint. We derive the constrained optimality conditions for the proposed optimization problem and use them to characterize the structural properties of the optimal fusion policy. Unlike classical differential privacy mechanisms, the optimal fusion policy is shown to adaptively allocates the privacy budget and regulates the adversary's belief in a closed-loop manner. To reduce the computational burden of solving the resulting constrained optimality equations, we parameterize the fusion policy using a structured Gaussian distribution and show that the parameterized fusion policy satisfies the privacy constraint. We further develop a numerical algorithm to jointly optimize the fusion policy and state estimator. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fusion framework through a traffic density estimation case study.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We introduce HorizonForge, a unified framework that reconstructs scenes as editable Gaussian Splats and Meshes, enabling fine-grained 3D manipulation and language-driven vehicle insertion. Edits are rendered through a noise-aware video diffusion process that enforces spatial and temporal consistency, producing diverse scene variations in a single feed-forward pass without per-trajectory optimization. To standardize evaluation, we further propose HorizonSuite, a comprehensive benchmark spanning ego- and agent-level editing tasks such as trajectory modifications and object manipulation. Extensive experiments show that Gaussian-Mesh representation delivers substantially higher fidelity than alternative 3D representations, and that temporal priors from video diffusion are essential for coherent synthesis. Combining these findings, HorizonForge establishes a simple yet powerful paradigm for photorealistic, controllable driving simulation, achieving an 83.4% user-preference gain and a 25.19% FID improvement over the second best state-of-the-art method.

ACAR uses self-consistency variance (sigma) computed from N=3 probe samples to route tasks across single-model, two-model, and three-model execution modes. The system is implemented on top of TEAMLLM, a deterministic execution substrate with immutable artifacts and complete decision traces. We evaluate ACAR on 1,510 tasks spanning four benchmarks: MathArena, Reasoning Gym, LiveCodeBench, and SuperGPQA, using Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.0 Flash, producing more than 7,550 auditable runs. Results show that sigma-based routing achieves 55.6 percent accuracy, exceeding the two-model baseline of 54.4 percent while avoiding full ensembling on 54.2 percent of tasks. The routing mechanism is model-agnostic and requires no learned components. We also document negative results. First, retrieval augmentation reduced accuracy by 3.4 percentage points, as median retrieval similarity was only 0.167, demonstrating that experience injection without semantic alignment introduces noise rather than grounding. Second, when models agree on incorrect answers (sigma equals zero), no downstream ensemble can recover; this agreement-but-wrong failure mode is intrinsic to self-consistency and bounds achievable accuracy at approximately eight percentage points below full ensembling.

However, severe path loss, blockage effects, and sensitivity to beam misalignment pose major challenges to reliable indoor THz communications. In this paper, we investigate the coverage probability of downlink transmission in a three-dimensional (3D) indoor THz communication system under structured access point (AP) deployments, with a focus on square and hexagonal grid topologies. A tractable analytical framework is developed to jointly account for human blockages, correlated wall blockages across APs, beam training, and residual pointing error. Numerical results demonstrate that wall blockage correlation significantly reduces the association and coverage probabilities, and its impact cannot be neglected in system performance analysis. Compared with square grid AP deployments, hexagonal grids consistently achieve higher coverage by mitigating correlated wall blockage effects and reducing the distances between user equipments (UEs) and their associated APs. Furthermore, coverage performance is shown to strongly depend on the UE location, with noticeable degradation as the UE moves away from its nearest AP. Residual pointing error is found to introduce substantial coverage loss, especially for longer links. In addition, beam training analysis reveals a non-monotonic relationship between antenna array size and training overhead, highlighting an inherent tradeoff among antenna configuration, beamwidth selection, and beam training efficiency. These findings provide useful insights into the design and deployment of practical indoor THz communication systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5ba4\u5185\u592a\u8d6b\u5179\u901a\u4fe1\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u63a5\u5165\u70b9\uff08AP\uff09\u90e8\u7f72\u4e0b\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u65b9\u5f62\u548c\u516d\u8fb9\u5f62\u7f51\u683c\u62d3\u6251\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4eba\u4f53\u906e\u6321\u3001\u5899\u58c1\u906e\u6321\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u6ce2\u675f\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6b8b\u7559\u6307\u5411\u8bef\u5dee\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u3002", "motivation": "\u592a\u8d6b\u5179\u901a\u4fe1\u56e0\u5176\u652f\u6301\u6781\u9ad8\u6570\u636e\u901f\u7387\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u6210\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u65e0\u7ebf\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f46\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u635f\u8017\u3001\u963b\u585e\u6548\u5e94\u548c\u5bf9\u6ce2\u675f\u5931\u51c6\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u7ed9\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u5ba4\u5185\u592a\u8d6b\u5179\u901a\u4fe1\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u6784\u5316AP\u90e8\u7f72\u4e0b\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8054\u5408\u8003\u8651\u4eba\u4f53\u906e\u6321\u3001AP\u95f4\u7684\u5899\u58c1\u906e\u6321\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u6ce2\u675f\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6b8b\u7559\u6307\u5411\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e09\u7ef4\u5ba4\u5185\u592a\u8d6b\u5179\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u4e0b\u884c\u94fe\u8def\u4f20\u8f93\u4e2d\u7684\u8986\u76d6\u6982\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9488\u5bf9\u65b9\u5f62\u548c\u516d\u8fb9\u5f62\u7f51\u683c\u62d3\u6251\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff1a\u5899\u58c1\u906e\u6321\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5173\u8054\u548c\u8986\u76d6\u6982\u7387\uff1b\u4e0e\u65b9\u5f62\u7f51\u683c\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u516d\u8fb9\u5f62\u7f51\u683c\u901a\u8fc7\u51cf\u8f7b\u76f8\u5173\u5899\u58c1\u906e\u6321\u6548\u5e94\u5e76\u7f29\u77ed\u7528\u6237\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0e\u5173\u8054AP\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\uff0c\u59cb\u7ec8\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u8986\u76d6\uff1b\u8986\u76d6\u6027\u80fd\u5f3a\u70c8\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8eUE\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff1b\u6b8b\u7559\u6307\u5411\u8bef\u5dee\u5bfc\u81f4\u663e\u8457\u8986\u76d6\u635f\u5931\uff1b\u6ce2\u675f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5929\u7ebf\u9635\u5217\u5927\u5c0f\u4e0e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f00\u9500\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5ba4\u5185\u592a\u8d6b\u5179\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u7528\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5899\u58c1\u906e\u6321\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001AP\u62d3\u6251\u9009\u62e9\u3001UE\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u6ce2\u675f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u7387\u7b49\u56e0\u7d20\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

The capacity of LLMs to self-regulate these complex, context-dependent sensitive information leaks without destroying utility remains an open scientific question. To address this, we introduce SemSIEdit, an inference-time framework where an agentic \"Editor\" iteratively critiques and rewrites sensitive spans to preserve narrative flow rather than simply refusing to answer. Our analysis reveals a Privacy-Utility Pareto Frontier, where this agentic rewriting reduces leakage by 34.6% across all three SemSI categories while incurring a marginal utility loss of 9.8%. We also uncover a Scale-Dependent Safety Divergence: large reasoning models (e.g., GPT-5) achieve safety through constructive expansion (adding nuance), whereas capacity-constrained models revert to destructive truncation (deleting text). Finally, we identify a Reasoning Paradox: while inference-time reasoning increases baseline risk by enabling the model to make deeper sensitive inferences, it simultaneously empowers the defense to execute safe rewrites.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our approach combines a narrowband LED array with a coded-exposure-pixel (CEP) camera capable of high-speed, per-pixel exposure control, enabling joint encoding of scene information across space, time, and wavelength within each video frame. Unlike passive snapshot systems that divide light across multiple spectral channels simultaneously and assume no motion during a frame's exposure, Lumosaic actively synchronizes illumination and pixel-wise exposure, improving photon utilization and preserving spectral fidelity under motion. A learning-based reconstruction pipeline then recovers 31-channel hyperspectral (400-700 nm) video at 30 fps and VGA resolution, producing temporally coherent and spectrally accurate reconstructions. Experiments on synthetic and real data demonstrate that Lumosaic significantly improves reconstruction fidelity and temporal stability over existing snapshot hyperspectral imaging systems, enabling robust hyperspectral video across diverse materials and motion conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Lumosaic\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u7d27\u51d1\u578b\u4e3b\u52a8\u5f0f\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u89c6\u9891\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u7a84\u5e26LED\u9635\u5217\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u66dd\u5149\u50cf\u7d20\uff08CEP\uff09\u76f8\u673a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6ce2\u957f\u7684\u8054\u5408\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u53ef\u572830fps\u4e0b\u5b9e\u65f6\u91cd\u5efaVGA\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u768431\u901a\u9053\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u88ab\u52a8\u5f0f\u5feb\u7167\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u6210\u50cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u66dd\u5149\u65f6\u5047\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u9759\u6b62\uff0c\u4e14\u5c06\u5149\u7ebf\u5206\u6563\u5230\u591a\u4e2a\u5149\u8c31\u901a\u9053\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5149\u5b50\u5229\u7528\u7387\u4f4e\u4e14\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u9891\u8c31\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u3001\u4e14\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4ecd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5149\u8c31\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u89c6\u9891\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "1\uff09\u786c\u4ef6\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408\u7a84\u5e26LED\u9635\u5217\u548c\u5177\u6709\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u66dd\u5149\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u7684CEP\u76f8\u673a\uff1b2\uff09\u7f16\u7801\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u4e3b\u52a8\u540c\u6b65\u7167\u660e\u548c\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u66dd\u5149\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a7a\u95f4\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u6ce2\u957f\u7684\u8054\u5408\u7f16\u7801\uff1b3\uff09\u91cd\u5efa\u6d41\u7a0b\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ece\u7f16\u7801\u5e27\u4e2d\u6062\u590d31\u901a\u9053\uff08400-700 nm\uff09\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u8fbe\u523030fps\u7684VGA\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5feb\u7167\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u6210\u50cf\u7cfb\u7edf\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cLumosaic\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u6750\u6599\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u89c6\u9891\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "conclusion": "Lumosaic\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u52a8\u7167\u660e\u4e0e\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u66dd\u5149\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u534f\u540c\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65f6\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u89c6\u9891\u91c7\u96c6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

As hard as global stabilization is, even harder is finding CLFs that are strict, don't require LaSalle arguments, and permit quantification of convergence. Among the three canonical types of two-population dynamics (mutualism, which borders on trivial, predator-prey, and competition, which makes global stabilization with positive harvesting impossible), predator-prey is the ``sweet spot'' for the study of stabilization. Even when the predator-prey interaction is neutrally stable, global asymptotic stabilization with strict CLFs has proven very difficult, except by conservative, hard-to-gain-insight-from Matrosov-like techniques.\n  In this little note we show directions for the design of clean, elegant, insight-bearing, majorization-free strict CLFs. They generalize the classical Volterra-style Lyapunov functions for population dynamics to non-separable Volterra-style constructions. As a bonus to strictification as an analysis activity, we provide examples of concurrent designs of feedback and CLFs, using customized versions of forwarding and backstepping (note that, in suitable coordinates, predator-prey is both strict-feedforward and strict-feedback), where the striking deviations from these methods' conventional forms is necessitated by the predator-prey's states and inputs needing to be kept positive.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This data bottleneck complicates the development of ambient intelligence for detecting, understanding, and mitigating rare or safety-critical events in the OR.\n  Methods: This work presents an OR video diffusion framework that enables controlled synthesis of rare and safety-critical events. The framework integrates a geometric abstraction module, a conditioning module, and a fine-tuned diffusion model to first transform OR scenes into abstract geometric representations, then condition the synthesis process, and finally generate realistic OR event videos. Using this framework, we also curate a synthetic dataset to train and validate AI models for detecting near-misses of sterile-field violations.\n  Results: In synthesizing routine OR events, our method outperforms off-the-shelf video diffusion baselines, achieving lower FVD/LPIPS and higher SSIM/PSNR in both in- and out-of-domain datasets. Through qualitative results, we illustrate its ability for controlled video synthesis of counterfactual events. An AI model trained and validated on the generated synthetic data achieved a RECALL of 70.13% in detecting near safety-critical events. Finally, we conduct an ablation study to quantify performance gains from key design choices.\n  Conclusion: Our solution enables controlled synthesis of routine and rare OR events from abstract geometric representations.

To facilitate efficient acceleration, we integrate state-of-the-art FP8 and INT8 Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) algorithms alongside pioneering research in ultra-low-bit regimes, featuring HY-1.8B-int2 as the first industrially viable 2-bit large model. Beyond quantization, we propose a training-aligned speculative decoding framework compatible with multimodal architectures and modern inference engines, achieving 1.8x to 2.0x throughput gains without compromising output correctness. Furthermore, we develop a training-free sparse attention framework that reduces Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) in long-context scenarios by decoupling sparse kernels from model architectures through a hybrid of static patterns and dynamic token selection.

However, under the dielectric scatterer model, the PA radiation pattern depends on its geometry. This letter investigates the radiation patterns of PAs with different geometries through full-wave simulations and measurements, and demonstrates how geometry influences the radiation directivity. In addition, an arc-shaped PA is introduced to enable transmit-direction control in PA systems. A PA system prototype consisting of a dielectric waveguide, waveguide transitions, and a PA element is proposed. Prototype measurements are used to validate the simulations and to characterize the directivity of square and triangular PAs, and the measurement procedure can be applied to obtain radiation patterns for PAs with general geometries. The simulation and measurement results jointly demonstrate that PA geometry is critical in PA systems because it influences the radiation characteristics significantly.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Given the homogeneity of these models, this raises the question of whether aggregation unlocks access to a greater set of outputs than querying a single model. In this work, we investigate the power and limitations of aggregation within a stylized principal-agent framework. This framework models how the system designer can partially steer each agent's output through its reward function specification, but still faces limitations due to prompt engineering ability and model capabilities. Our analysis uncovers three natural mechanisms -- feasibility expansion, support expansion, and binding set contraction -- through which aggregation expands the set of outputs that are elicitable by the system designer. We prove that any aggregation operation must implement one of these mechanisms in order to be elicitability-expanding, and that strengthened versions of these mechanisms provide necessary and sufficient conditions that fully characterize elicitability-expansion. Finally, we provide an empirical illustration of our findings for LLMs deployed in a toy reference-generation task. Altogether, our results take a step towards characterizing when compound AI systems can overcome limitations in model capabilities and in prompt engineering.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Knowledge distillation (KD) offers a practical solution by transferring genomic supervision into histopathology models, enabling accurate inference using histology alone. However, existing KD methods rely on batch-local alignment, which introduces instability due to limited within-batch comparisons and ultimately degrades performance.\n  To address these limitations, we propose Momentum Memory Knowledge Distillation (MoMKD), a cross-modal distillation framework driven by a momentum-updated memory. This memory aggregates genomic and histopathology information across batches, effectively enlarging the supervisory context available to each mini-batch. Furthermore, we decouple the gradients of the genomics and histology branches, preventing genomic signals from dominating histology feature learning during training and eliminating the modality-gap issue at inference time.\n  Extensive experiments on the TCGA-BRCA benchmark (HER2, PR, and ODX classification tasks) and an independent in-house testing dataset demonstrate that MoMKD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MIL and multimodal KD baselines, delivering strong performance and generalization under histology-only inference. Overall, MoMKD establishes a robust and generalizable knowledge distillation paradigm for computational pathology.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Instead of optimizing on the probability simplex and inheriting the exponential curvature of Kullback-Leibler divergence, GOPO lifts alignment into the Hilbert space L2(pi_k) of square-integrable functions with respect to the reference policy. Within this space, the simplex constraint reduces to a linear orthogonality condition <v, 1> = 0, defining a codimension-one subspace H0. Minimizing distance to an unconstrained target u_star yields the work-dissipation functional J(v) = <g, v> - (mu / 2) ||v||^2, whose maximizer follows directly from the Hilbert projection theorem. Enforcing the boundary v >= -1 produces a bounded Hilbert projection that induces exact sparsity, assigning zero probability to catastrophically poor actions through a closed-form threshold. To connect this functional theory with practice, GOPO projects from infinite-dimensional L2(pi_k) to a finite empirical subspace induced by group sampling. Because group-normalized advantages sum to zero, the Lagrange multiplier enforcing probability conservation vanishes exactly, reducing the constrained projection to an unconstrained empirical loss. The resulting objective has constant Hessian curvature mu I, non-saturating linear gradients, and an intrinsic dead-zone mechanism without heuristic clipping.

Meanwhile, emerging 6G demands such as immersive communications and environmental sensing pose challenges to traditional signal processing. To address these issues, we propose the ``semantic-aware MIMO'' paradigm, which leverages specialist models and large models to perceive, utilize, and fuse the inherent semantics of channels and sources for improved performance. Moreover, for representative MIMO physical-layer tasks, e.g., random access activity detection, channel feedback, and precoding, we design specialist models that exploit channel and source semantics for better performance. Additionally, in view of the more diversified functions of 6G MIMO, we further explore large models as a scalable solution for multi-task semantic-aware MIMO and review recent advances along with their advantages and limitations. Finally, we discuss the challenges, insights, and prospects of the evolution of specialist models and large models empowered semantic-aware MIMO paradigms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The mode characterizes the shift from suppression (S0) to expression (S1) as occurring when facilitative forces exceed inhibitory thresholds, expressed by the inequality lambda(1+gamma)+psi > theta+phi, where the terms represent baseline openness, relational amplification, accumulated internal pressure, and transition costs.\n  Although initially formulated for human truth-telling under asymmetric stakes, the same phase-dynamic architecture extends to AI systems operating under policy constraints and alignment filters. In this context, suppression corresponds to constrained output states, while structural pressure arises from competing objectives, contextual tension, and recursive interaction dynamics. The framework therefore provides a unified structural account of both human silence under pressure and AI preference-driven distortion.\n  A feedback extension models how transition outcomes recursively recalibrate system parameters, generating path dependence and divergence effects across repeated interactions. Rather than attributing intention to AI systems, the model interprets shifts in apparent truthfulness as geometric consequences of interacting forces within constrained phase space. By reframing courage and alignment within a shared dynamical structure, the ASIR Courage Model offers a formal perspective on truth-disclosure under risk across both human and artificial systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While extending prompts to both vision and text encoders across multiple transformer layers significantly boosts performance, it dramatically increases the number of trainable parameters, with state-of-the-art methods requiring millions of parameters and abandoning the parameter efficiency that makes prompt tuning attractive. In this work, we propose \\textbf{MMLoP} (\\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{M}odal \\textbf{Lo}w-Rank \\textbf{P}rompting), a framework that achieves deep multi-modal prompting with only \\textbf{11.5K trainable parameters}, comparable to early text-only methods like CoOp. MMLoP parameterizes vision and text prompts at each transformer layer through a low-rank factorization, which serves as an implicit regularizer against overfitting on few-shot training data. To further close the accuracy gap with state-of-the-art methods, we introduce three complementary components: a self-regulating consistency loss that anchors prompted representations to frozen zero-shot CLIP features at both the feature and logit levels, a uniform drift correction that removes the global embedding shift induced by prompt tuning to preserve class-discriminative structure, and a shared up-projection that couples vision and text prompts through a common low-rank factor to enforce cross-modal alignment. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks and 11 diverse datasets demonstrate that MMLoP achieves a highly favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoff, outperforming the majority of existing methods including those with orders of magnitude more parameters, while achieving a harmonic mean of 79.70\\% on base-to-novel generalization.", "AI": {"tldr": "MMLoP\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u5b9e\u73b0\u6df1\u5ea6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u4ec5\u970011.5K\u53ef\u8bad\u7ec3\u53c2\u6570\u5c31\u80fd\u53d6\u5f97\u4e0e\u65e9\u671f\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u6570\u767e\u4e07\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5931\u53bb\u4e86\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u5e0c\u671b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u53c8\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6df1\u5ea6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "MMLoP\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e09\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff1a1\uff09\u7279\u5f81\u548clogit\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u81ea\u8c03\u8282\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5c06\u63d0\u793a\u7279\u5f81\u951a\u5b9a\u5230\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684CLIP\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\uff1b2\uff09\u5747\u5300\u6f02\u79fb\u6821\u6b63\uff0c\u6d88\u9664\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5d4c\u5165\u504f\u79fb\uff1b3\uff09\u5171\u4eab\u4e0a\u6295\u5f71\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u540c\u4f4e\u79e9\u56e0\u5b50\u8026\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u4ee5\u52a0\u5f3a\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u57283\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c11\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMMLoP\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387-\u6548\u7387\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5927\u591a\u6570\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u90a3\u4e9b\u53c2\u6570\u591a\u7684\u591a\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u57fa\u7c7b\u5230\u65b0\u7c7b\u6cdb\u5316\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u4e8679.70%\u7684\u8c03\u548c\u5747\u503c\u3002", "conclusion": "MMLoP\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u5206\u89e3\u548c\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u752811.5K\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e3a\u4fdd\u6301\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u6548\u7387\u4f18\u52bf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Necessary and sufficient conditions for valid parity assignments are established in terms of distance constraints between codewords and their nearest non-codewords. It is shown that the Hamming-distance-3 relations among Hamming codewords induce a bipartite graph, a fundamental geometric property that is exploited to develop a systematic SEFCC construction. By deriving a tight upper bound on the sum of pairwise distances, we prove that the proposed bipartite construction uniquely achieves the maximum sum-distance, the largest possible minimum distance of 2, and the minimum number of distance-2 codeword pairs. Consequently, for the HCMF SEFCC problem, sum-distance maximisation is not merely heuristic-it exactly enforces the optimal distance-spectrum properties relevant to error probability. Simulation results over AWGN channels with soft-decision decoding confirm that the resulting max-sum SEFCCs provide significantly improved data protection and Bit Error Rate (BER) performance compared to arbitrary valid assignments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u6c49\u660e\u7801\u6210\u5458\u51fd\u6570\uff08HCMF\uff09\u7684\u5355\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u6b63\u51fd\u6570\u6821\u6b63\u7801\uff08SEFCCs\uff09\uff0c\u8be5\u51fd\u6570\u6307\u793a\u5411\u91cf\u662f\u5426\u5c5e\u4e8e[7,4,3]-\u6c49\u660e\u7801\u3002\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5947\u5076\u6821\u9a8c\u5206\u914d\u7684\u5145\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u6c49\u660e\u7801\u5b57\u95f4\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684SEFCC\u6784\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u6784\u9020\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5927\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u3001\u6700\u5c0f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e3a2\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728AWGN\u4fe1\u9053\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584BER\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u5355\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u6b63\u51fd\u6570\u6821\u6b63\u7801\uff08SEFCCs\uff09\u7528\u4e8e\u6c49\u660e\u7801\u6210\u5458\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\uff1a\u4f20\u7edf\u7ea0\u9519\u7801\u4e3b\u8981\u4fdd\u62a4\u6570\u636e\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u800c\u51fd\u6570\u6821\u6b63\u7801\u65e8\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u6c49\u660e\u7801\u6210\u5458\u51fd\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u5e03\u5c14\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u5b58\u50a8\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u901a\u4fe1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002\u9700\u8981\u8bbe\u8ba1\u80fd\u591f\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5355\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\u7684SEFCCs\u6765\u4fdd\u8bc1\u51fd\u6570\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "1. \u5efa\u7acb\u6709\u6548\u5947\u5076\u6821\u9a8c\u5206\u914d\u7684\u5145\u8981\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7801\u5b57\u4e0e\u5176\u6700\u8fd1\u975e\u7801\u5b57\u95f4\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u7ea6\u675f\n2. \u53d1\u73b0\u6c49\u660e\u7801\u5b57\u95f4\u7684\u6c49\u660e\u8ddd\u79bb3\u5173\u7cfb\u5f62\u6210\u4e8c\u90e8\u56fe\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e00\u51e0\u4f55\u6027\u8d28\u5f00\u53d1\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316SEFCC\u6784\u9020\n3. \u63a8\u5bfc\u914d\u5bf9\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u7684\u7d27\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e8c\u90e8\u6784\u9020\u80fd\u552f\u4e00\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5927\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u3001\u6700\u5c0f\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e3a2\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u7279\u6027\n4. \u901a\u8fc7AWGN\u4fe1\u9053\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u8f6f\u5224\u51b3\u89e3\u7801", "result": "1. \u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e8c\u90e8\u56fe\u6784\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\u552f\u4e00\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5927\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u3001\u6700\u5927\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u8ddd\u79bb2\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u6700\u5c11\u6570\u91cf\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb2\u7801\u5b57\u5bf9\n2. \u5bf9\u4e8eHCMF SEFCC\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u6700\u5927\u5316\u4e0d\u4ec5\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u4e14\u7cbe\u786e\u5730\u5f3a\u5236\u4e86\u4e0e\u9519\u8bef\u6982\u7387\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u8ddd\u79bb\u8c31\u7279\u6027\n3. \u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e0e\u4efb\u610f\u6709\u6548\u5206\u914d\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u6700\u5927\u548cSEFCC\u5728AWGN\u4fe1\u9053\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u62a4\u548c\u6bd4\u7279\u8bef\u7801\u7387\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7528\u4e8e\u6c49\u660e\u7801\u6210\u5458\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5355\u9519\u8bef\u6821\u6b63\u51fd\u6570\u6821\u6b63\u7801\u8bbe\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u6c49\u660e\u7801\u5b57\u95f4\u8ddd\u79bb\u5173\u7cfb\u5f62\u6210\u7684\u4e8c\u90e8\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u6784\u9020\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u6784\u9020\u5177\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5927\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u3002\u4eff\u771f\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u4fe1\u9053\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u5de5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u51fd\u6570\u6821\u6b63\u7801\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

In these systems, agents can join or leave the network over time, and the interaction structure may evolve accordingly. To capture these dynamical structural changes, we represent the network as a switched system interconnected over a dynamic and directed signed graph. Additionally, the network may contain one or multiple leader groups that influence the behavior of the remaining agents. In general, we show that the OMAS exhibit a more general form of synchronization, including trivial consensus, bipartite consensus and containment. Our approach uses the signed edge-based agreement protocol, and constructs strict Lyapunov functions for signed networks described by signed edge-Laplacian matrices containing multiple zero eigenvalues.

The original model combined a fuzzy Ethical Risk Assessment module (fERA) with ethical decision rules, enabled formal structural verification through Fuzzy Petri Nets (FPNs), and validated outputs against a single normative referent. Although this approach ensured formal soundness and decision consistency, it did not fully address two critical challenges: principled explainability of decisions and robustness under ethical pluralism. In this paper, we extend fEDM in two major directions. First, we introduce an Explainability and Traceability Module (ETM) that explicitly links each ethical decision rule to the underlying moral principles and computes a weighted principle-contribution profile for every recommended action. This enables transparent, auditable explanations that expose not only what decision was made but why, and on the basis of which principles. Second, we replace single-referent validation with a pluralistic semantic validation framework that evaluates decisions against multiple stakeholder referents, each encoding distinct principle priorities and risk tolerances. This shift allows principled disagreement to be formally represented rather than suppressed, thus increasing robustness and contextual sensitivity. The resulting extended fEDM, called fEDM+, preserves formal verifiability while achieving enhanced interpretability and stakeholder-aware validation, making it suitable as an oversight and governance layer for ethically sensitive AI systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86fEDM+\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u539f\u6709\u6a21\u7cca\u4f26\u7406\u51b3\u7b56\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u591a\u5143\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u51b3\u7b56\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u4f26\u7406\u591a\u5143\u4e3b\u4e49\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u539f\u59cbfEDM\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u548c\u51b3\u7b56\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u89e3\u51b3\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u51b3\u7b56\u7684\u539f\u5219\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4f26\u7406\u591a\u5143\u4e3b\u4e49\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u539f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f26\u7406\u654f\u611fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u5c42", "method": "1) \u5f15\u5165\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6027\u6a21\u5757(ETM)\uff0c\u5c06\u6bcf\u4e2a\u4f26\u7406\u51b3\u7b56\u89c4\u5219\u4e0e\u5e95\u5c42\u9053\u5fb7\u539f\u5219\u660e\u786e\u94fe\u63a5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u63a8\u8350\u884c\u52a8\u8ba1\u7b97\u52a0\u6743\u539f\u5219\u8d21\u732e\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\uff1b2) \u7528\u591a\u5143\u5316\u8bed\u4e49\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6846\u67b6\u66ff\u4ee3\u5355\u4e00\u53c2\u7167\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u4e2a\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u539f\u5219\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u5bb9\u5fcd\u5ea6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u4f30", "result": "\u6269\u5c55\u540e\u7684fEDM+\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5f62\u5f0f\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u5229\u76ca\u76f8\u5173\u8005\u610f\u8bc6\u9a8c\u8bc1", "conclusion": "fEDM+\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u539f\u5219\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u591a\u5143\u5316\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f26\u7406\u654f\u611fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u6cbb\u7406\u5c42\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5f62\u5f0f\u4e25\u8c28\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5904\u7406\u4f26\u7406\u51b3\u7b56\u4e2d\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u591a\u6837\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u95ee\u9898"}}

To get the most out of every byte, practitioners and theorists have introduced the framework of maximal recoverability (MR) to study optimal error-correcting codes in various architectures. In this survey, we dive into the study of two families of MR codes: MR locally recoverable codes (LRCs) (also known as partial MDS codes) and grid codes (GCs).\n  For each of these two families of codes, we discuss the primary recoverability guarantees as well as what is known concerning optimal constructions. Along the way, we discuss many surprising connections between MR codes and broader questions in computer science and mathematics. For MR LRCs, the use of skew polynomial codes has unified many previous constructions. For MR GCs, the theory of higher order MDS codes shows that MR GCs can be used to construct optimal list-decodable codes.

However, acquiring accurate CSI a priori is notoriously challenging due to the time-varying nature of wireless channels. In this work, we propose a pilot-free framework for optimal control over wireless channels in which control commands are generated from plant states together with control-aided channel prediction. For linear plants operating over an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) architecture, channel prediction is performed via a Kalman filter (KF), and the optimal control policy is derived from the Bellman principle. To alleviate the curse of dimensionality in computing the optimal control policy, we approximate the solution using a coupled algebraic Riccati equation (CARE), which can be computed efficiently via a stochastic approximation (SA) algorithm. Rigorous performance guarantees are established by proving the stability of both the channel predictor and the closed-loop system under the resulting control policy, providing sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a stabilizing approximate CARE solution, and establishing convergence of the SA-based control algorithm. The framework is further extended to nonlinear plants under general wireless architectures by combining a KalmanNet-based predictor with a Markov-modulated deep deterministic policy gradient (MM-DDPG) controller. Numerical results show that the proposed pilot-free approach outperforms benchmark schemes in both control performance and channel prediction accuracy for linear and nonlinear scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We present a variable isolation study (n=20 per condition, 6 conditions, 120 total trials) examining which prompt architecture layers in a production system enable correct reasoning. Using Claude 3.5 Sonnet with controlled hyperparameters (temperature 0.7, top_p 1.0), we find that the STAR (Situation-Task-Action-Result) reasoning framework alone raises accuracy from 0% to 85% (p=0.001, Fisher's exact test, odds ratio 13.22). Adding user profile context via vector database retrieval provides a further 10 percentage point gain, while RAG context contributes an additional 5 percentage points, achieving 100% accuracy in the full-stack condition.

When the number of simultaneous active users is less than or equal to w, such a code is able to provide a hard guarantee that each active user has a successful transmission within every consecutive L time slots. Recently, CACs were extended to multichannel CAcs (MC-CACs) over M orthogonal channels with the aim of increasing the number of potential users that can be supported. While most existing results on MC-CAC are derived under the assumption that M is not less than w, this paper focuses on the case that M is less than w, which is more relevant to practical application scenarios. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of exceptional codewords in MC-CACs. By employing some techniques from additive combinatorics, we derive a series of optimal MC-CACs.

A unified geometric model is developed, yielding a coupled agent--payload differential--algebraic system that explicitly captures contact wrenches, payload dynamics, and internal force redundancy.

Existing multimodal models achieve strong results when generating SVGs from clean renderings or textual descriptions, but they fall short in real-world scenarios where natural images introduce noise, clutter, and domain shifts. A central challenge in this direction is the lack of suitable benchmarks. To address this need, we introduce the WildSVG Benchmark, formed by two complementary datasets: Natural WildSVG, built from real images containing company logos paired with their SVG annotations, and Synthetic WildSVG, which blends complex SVG renderings into real scenes to simulate difficult conditions. Together, these resources provide the first foundation for systematic benchmarking SVG extraction. We benchmark state-of-the-art multimodal models and find that current approaches perform well below what is needed for reliable SVG extraction in real scenarios.

This metric can be used to support the implementation of autonomous and supervised aircraft procedures, to achieve a more structured and coordinated airspace.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5de1\u822a\u9636\u6bb5\u524d\u540e\u673a\u5bf9\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u5236\u5458\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e0e\u534f\u8c03\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u65b0\u6307\u6807\u2014\u2014\u6210\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff08PDW\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff08DD\uff09\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u8fde\u7eed\u8bc4\u4f30\u7a7a\u57df\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u76d1\u6d4b\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u98de\u673a\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u7cbe\u7ec6\u7684\u6307\u6807\u6765\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u4e3b\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u98de\u673a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u534f\u8c03\u5316\u7684\u7a7a\u57df\u7ba1\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86PDW\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fde\u7eed\u51fd\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7a7a\u57df\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u8be5\u51fd\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u524d\u540e\u673a\u5bf9\u64cd\u4f5c\u7684\u5173\u952e\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u5982\u98de\u673a\u95f4\u9694\u548c\u95f4\u9694\u53d8\u5316\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u91cf\u5316\u7ba1\u5236\u5458\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eDD\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "PDW\u80fd\u591f\u8fde\u7eed\u8bc4\u4f30\u7a7a\u57df\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u76d1\u6d4b\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u98de\u673a\u53c2\u6570\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u65bd\u81ea\u4e3b\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u98de\u673a\u7a0b\u5e8f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4DD\u5177\u5907\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u76d1\u63a7\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\uff08PDW\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7a7a\u57df\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u91cf\u5316\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u7cbe\u51c6\u7684\u7a7a\u4e2d\u4ea4\u901a\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u3001\u534f\u8c03\u5316\u7684\u7a7a\u57df\u8fd0\u4f5c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, we still lack a deep understanding of the effects of adoption of these technologies. In this paper, we introduce a general computational framework, the 2-Step Agent, which models the effects of AI-assisted decision making. Our framework uses Bayesian methods for causal inference to model 1) how a prediction on a new observation affects the beliefs of a rational Bayesian agent, and 2) how this change in beliefs affects the downstream decision and subsequent outcome. Using this framework, we show by simulations how a single misaligned prior belief can be sufficient for decision support to result in worse downstream outcomes compared to no decision support. Our results reveal several potential pitfalls of AI-driven decision support and highlight the need for thorough model documentation and proper user training.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a common approach for injecting such agentic capabilities, but typically under tightly controlled training setups. It often depends on carefully constructed task-solution pairs and substantial human supervision, which creates a fundamental obstacle to open-ended self-evolution toward superintelligent systems. In this paper, we propose Tool-R0 framework for training general purpose tool-calling agents from scratch with self-play RL, under a zero-data assumption. Initialized from the same base LLM, Tool-R0 co-evolves a Generator and a Solver with complementary rewards: one proposes targeted challenging tasks at the other's competence frontier and the other learns to solve them with real-world tool calls. This creates a self-evolving cycle that requires no pre-existing tasks or datasets. Evaluation on different tool-use benchmarks show that Tool-R0 yields 92.5 relative improvement over the base model and surpasses fully supervised tool-calling baselines under the same setting.

With the ongoing deployment of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs) and increasing vehicle connectivity, the integration of traffic information has become crucial for improving both energy efficiency and thermal comfort in modern vehicles. To enhance fuel economy, this paper proposes a novel traffic-aware hierarchical integrated thermal and energy management (TA-ITEM) strategy for connected HEVs. In the upper layer, global reference trajectories for battery state of charge (SOC) and cabin temperature are planned using traffic flow speed information obtained from ITSs. In the lower layer, a real-time model predictive control (MPC)-based ITEM controller is developed, which incorporates a novel Transformer-based speed predictor with driving condition recognition (TF-DCR) to enable anticipatory tracking of the reference trajectories. Numerical simulations are conducted under various driving cycles and ambient temperature conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed TA-ITEM approach outperforms conventional rule-based and MPC-SP approaches, with average fuel consumption reductions of 56.36\\% and 5.84\\%, respectively, while maintaining superior thermal regulation and cabin comfort.

We introduce Paraphrase Sensitivity Failure (PSF)-Med, a benchmark of 19,748 chest Xray questions paired with about 92,000 meaningpreserving paraphrases across MIMIC-CXR and PadChest. Across six medical VLMs, we measure yes/no flips for the same image and find flip rates from 8% to 58%. However, low flip rate does not imply visual grounding: text-only baselines show that some models stay consistent even when the image is removed, suggesting they rely on language priors. To study mechanisms in one model, we apply GemmaScope 2 Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to MedGemma 4B and analyze FlipBank, a curated set of 158 flip cases. We identify a sparse feature at layer 17 that correlates with prompt framing and predicts decision margin shifts. In causal patching, removing this feature's contribution recovers 45% of the yesminus-no logit margin on average and fully reverses 15% of flips. Acting on this finding, we show that clamping the identified feature at inference reduces flip rates by 31% relative with only a 1.3 percentage-point accuracy cost, while also decreasing text-prior reliance. These results suggest that flip rate alone is not enough; robustness evaluations should test both paraphrase stability and image reliance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, non-ideal analog device properties make the training on AIMC devices challenging. In particular, its update asymmetry can induce a systematic drift of weight updates towards a device-specific symmetric point (SP), which typically does not align with the optimum of the training objective. To mitigate this bias, most existing works assume the SP is known and pre-calibrate it to zero before training by setting the reference point as the SP. Nevertheless, calibrating AIMC devices requires costly pulse updates, and residual calibration error can directly degrade training accuracy. In this work, we present the first theoretical characterization of the pulse complexity of SP calibration and the resulting estimation error. We further propose a dynamic SP estimation method that tracks the SP during model training, and establishes its convergence guarantees. In addition, we develop an enhanced variant based on chopping and filtering techniques from digital signal processing.

How do LLMs weigh the information provided by these different sources? We consider the well-studied phenomenon of algorithm aversion, in which human decision-makers exhibit bias against predictions from algorithms. Drawing upon experimental paradigms from behavioural economics, we evaluate how eightdifferent LLMs delegate decision-making tasks when the delegatee is framed as a human expert or an algorithmic agent. To be inclusive of different evaluation formats, we conduct our study with two task presentations: stated preferences, modeled through direct queries about trust towards either agent, and revealed preferences, modeled through providing in-context examples of the performance of both agents. When prompted to rate the trustworthiness of human experts and algorithms across diverse tasks, LLMs give higher ratings to the human expert, which correlates with prior results from human respondents. However, when shown the performance of a human expert and an algorithm and asked to place an incentivized bet between the two, LLMs disproportionately choose the algorithm, even when it performs demonstrably worse. These discrepant results suggest that LLMs may encode inconsistent biases towards humans and algorithms, which need to be carefully considered when they are deployed in high-stakes scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss the sensitivity of LLMs to task presentation formats that should be broadly scrutinized in evaluation robustness for AI safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing approaches largely focus on architectural unification while overlooking the need for explicit interaction between the two capabilities during task solving. As a result, current models treat understanding and generation as parallel skills rather than synergistic processes. To achieve real synergy, we introduce the interleaved Analyzing-Drafting problem-solving loop (AD-Loop), a new think paradigm that dynamically alternates between analytic and drafting operations. By interleaving textual thoughts with visual thoughts, AD-Loop enables models to iteratively refine both comprehension and outputs, fostering genuine synergy. To train this mechanism, we design a two-stage strategy: supervised learning on interleaved thought data to initialize alternation, followed by reinforcement learning to promote adaptive and autonomous control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AD-Loop consistently improves performance across standard benchmarks for both understanding and generation, with strong transferability to various UVLMs architectures. Visual analyses further validate the effectiveness of implicit visual thoughts. These results highlight AD-Loop as a principled and broadly applicable strategy for synergizing comprehension and creation.

Three inference-time mitigations were evaluated on adversarial images: randomized preprocessing with test-time augmentation, deterministic input denoising, and stochastic ensemble inference with consistency-aware aggregation. Experiments were conducted on a U-Net segmentation model trained on cine-clips from a database of 192 thyroid nodules. Results: The baseline model achieved a mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 0.76 (SD 0.20) on unperturbed images. SSAA reduced DSC by 0.29 (SD 0.20) while maintaining high visual similarity (SSIM = 0.94). FDUA resulted in a smaller DSC reduction of 0.11 (SD 0.09) with lower visual fidelity (SSIM = 0.82). Against SSAA, all three defenses significantly improved DSC after correction, with deterministic denoising showing the largest recovery (+0.10, p < 0.001), followed by randomized preprocessing (+0.09, p < 0.001), and stochastic ensemble inference (+0.08, p = 0.002). No defense achieved statistically significant improvement against FDUA. Conclusion: Spatial-domain adversarial perturbations in ultrasound segmentation showed partial mitigation with input preprocessing, whereas frequency-domain perturbations were not mitigated by the defenses, highlighting modality-specific challenges in adversarial robustness evaluation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A critical mechanism for controlling local VPR performance is the density of the reference mapping database, yet this factor is largely neglected in existing work, where benchmark datasets with fixed, engineering-driven (sensors, storage, GPS frequency) sampling densities are typically used. In this paper, we propose a dynamic VPR mapping approach that uses pairs of reference traverses from the target environment to automatically select an appropriate map density to satisfy two user-defined requirements: (1) a target Local Recall@1 level, and (2) the proportion of the operational environment over which this requirement must be met or exceeded, which we term the Recall Achievement Rate (RAR). Our approach is based on the hypothesis that match patterns between multiple reference traverses, evaluated across different map densities, can be modelled to predict the density required to meet these performance targets on unseen deployment data. Through extensive experiments across multiple VPR methods and the Nordland and Oxford RobotCar benchmarks, we show that our system consistently achieves or exceeds the specified local recall level over at least the user-specified proportion of the environment. Comparisons with alternative baselines demonstrate that our approach reliably selects the correct operating point in map density, avoiding unnecessary over-densification. Finally, ablation studies and analysis evaluate sensitivity to reference map choice and local space definitions, and reveal that conventional global Recall@1 is a poor predictor of the often more operationally meaningful RAR metric.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, a critical gap remains for their deployment in safety-critical domains: the lack of formal guarantees that generated samples will satisfy hard constraints. We address this by proposing a safety filtering framework that acts as an online shield for any pre-trained generative model. Our key insight is to cooperate with the generative process rather than override it. We define a constricting safety tube that is relaxed at the initial noise distribution and progressively tightens to the target safe set at the final data distribution, mirroring the coarse-to-fine structure of the generative process itself. By characterizing this tube via Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), we synthesize a feedback control input through a convex Quadratic Program (QP) at each sampling step. As the tube is loosest when noise is high and intervention is cheapest in terms of control energy, most constraint enforcement occurs when it least disrupts the model's learned structure. We prove that this mechanism guarantees safe sampling while minimizing the distributional shift from the original model at each sampling step, as quantified by the KL divergence. Our framework applies to any pre-trained flow-based generative scheme requiring no retraining or architectural modifications. We validate the approach across constrained image generation, physically-consistent trajectory sampling, and safe robotic manipulation policies, achieving 100% constraint satisfaction while preserving semantic fidelity.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To reduce annotation dependency, unsupervised and sparsely-supervised paradigms have emerged.

This paper proposes SPL, a unified training framework for both Unsupervised and Sparsely-Supervised 3D Object Detection via Semantic Pseudo-labeling and prototype Learning. SPL first generates high-quality pseudo-labels by integrating image semantics, point cloud geometry, and temporal cues, producing both 3D bounding boxes for dense objects and 3D point labels for sparse ones. These pseudo-labels are not used directly but as probabilistic priors within a novel, multi-stage prototype learning strategy. This strategy stabilizes feature representation learning through memory-based initialization and momentum-based prototype updating, effectively mining features from both labeled and unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on KITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that SPL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both settings.

Despite recent advances in achieving high performance on these downstream tasks, little progress has been made toward self-explainable models. Understanding the patterns behind predictions is equally important, motivating recent interest in explainable machine learning. In this paper, we present GraphHull, an explainable generative model that represents networks using two levels of convex hulls. At the global level, the vertices of a convex hull are treated as archetypes, each corresponding to a pure community in the network. At the local level, each community is refined by a prototypical hull whose vertices act as representative profiles, capturing community-specific variation. This two-level construction yields clear multi-scale explanations: a node's position relative to global archetypes and its local prototypes directly accounts for its edges. The geometry is well-behaved by design, while local hulls are kept disjoint by construction. To further encourage diversity and stability, we place principled priors, including determinantal point processes, and fit the model under MAP estimation with scalable subsampling. Experiments on real networks demonstrate the ability of GraphHull to recover multi-level community structure and to achieve competitive or superior performance in link prediction and community detection, while naturally providing interpretable predictions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, CoT reasoning in multimodal contexts is highly vulnerable to visual hallucination propagation: once an intermediate reasoning step becomes inconsistent with the visual evidence, subsequent steps-even if logically valid-can still lead to incorrect final answers. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate this issue by training models to \"think with images\" via reinforcement learning (RL). While effective, these methods are costly, model-specific, and difficult to generalize across architectures. Differently, we present a lightweight method that bypasses RL training and provides an iterative, training-free, plug-and-play framework for visually-grounded multimodal reasoning. Our key idea is to supervise each reasoning step at test time with visual evidence, ensuring that every decoded token is justified by corresponding visual cues. Concretely, we construct a textual visual-evidence pool that guides the model's reasoning generation. When existing evidence is insufficient, a visual decider module dynamically extracts additional relevant evidence from the image based on the ongoing reasoning context, expanding the pool until the model achieves sufficient visual certainty to terminate reasoning and produce the final answer. Extensive experiments on multiple LVLM backbones and benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

When deployed at an unseen clinical site, test cases arrive in unlabeled, non-i.i.d. batches, and the model must adapt immediately without labels. In this work, we introduce an entropy-adaptive, fully online model-merging method that yields a batch-specific merged model via only forward passes, effectively leveraging target information. We further demonstrate why mean merging is prone to failure and misaligned under heterogeneous domain shifts. Next, we mitigate encoder classifier mismatch by decoupling the encoder and classification head, merging with separate merging coefficients. We extensively evaluate our method with state-of-the-art baselines using two backbones across nine medical and natural-domain generalization image classification datasets, showing consistent gains across standard evaluation and challenging scenarios.

Specifically, we introduce a bidirectional pseudo frame restoration method that restores missing content by diffusion-based synthesis guided by adjacent frames with a lightweight pseudo-view deblur model and confidence mask inference algorithm.

Specifically, an invertible hierarchy flow (IHF) performs hierarchical subtractive coupling to progressively remove artefact-related features, while an artefact-aware normalization (AAN) employs anatomy-fixed feature modulation to accurately transfer target characteristics. Combined with anatomy and artefact consistency loss objectives, IHF-Harmony achieves high-fidelity harmonization that retains source anatomy.

However, data heterogeneity across clients leads to client drift, which degrades the overall generalization performance of the model. This effect is further compounded by overemphasis on poorly performing clients. To address this problem, we propose FedVG, a novel gradient-based federated aggregation framework that leverages a global validation set to guide the optimization process. Such a global validation set can be established using readily available public datasets, ensuring accessibility and consistency across clients without compromising privacy. In contrast to conventional approaches that prioritize client dataset volume, FedVG assesses the generalization ability of client models by measuring the magnitude of validation gradients across layers. Specifically, we compute layerwise gradient norms to derive a client-specific score that reflects how much each client needs to adjust for improved generalization on the global validation set, thereby enabling more informed and adaptive federated aggregation. Extensive experiments on both natural and medical image benchmarking datasets, across diverse model architectures, demonstrate that FedVG consistently improves performance, particularly in highly heterogeneous settings.

Existing approaches largely rely on depth priors (e.g., DepthAnything) but make only limited use of 3D cues, restricting performance and generalization. Recently, visual geometry models such as VGGT have shown strong capability in providing rich 3D priors, but similar to monocular depth foundation models, they still operate at the level of visible surfaces rather than volumetric interiors, motivating us to explore how to more effectively leverage these increasingly powerful geometry priors for 3D occupancy prediction. We present GPOcc, a framework that leverages generalizable visual geometry priors (GPs) for monocular occupancy prediction. Our method extends surface points inward along camera rays to generate volumetric samples, which are represented as Gaussian primitives for probabilistic occupancy inference. To handle streaming input, we further design a training-free incremental update strategy that fuses per-frame Gaussians into a unified global representation. Experiments on Occ-ScanNet and EmbodiedOcc-ScanNet demonstrate significant gains: GPOcc improves mIoU by +9.99 in the monocular setting and +11.79 in the streaming setting over prior state of the art. Under the same depth prior, it achieves +6.73 mIoU while running 2.65$\\times$ faster. These results highlight that GPOcc leverages geometry priors more effectively and efficiently.

While diffusion-based methods have achieved remarkable success, most existing approaches are limited to single-character animation. We observe that naively extending these methods to multi-character scenarios often leads to identity confusion and implausible occlusions between characters. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an extensible multi-character image animation framework built upon modern Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for video generation. At its core, our framework introduces two novel components-Identifier Assigner and Identifier Adapter - which collaboratively capture per-person positional cues and inter-person spatial relationships. This mask-driven scheme, along with a scalable training strategy, not only enhances flexibility but also enables generalization to scenarios with more characters than those seen during training. Remarkably, trained on only a two-character dataset, our model generalizes to multi-character animation while maintaining compatibility with single-character cases. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-character image animation, surpassing existing diffusion-based baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, standard RLVR algorithms suffer from a well-documented pathology: while they improve Pass@1 accuracy through sharpened sampling, they simultaneously narrow the model's reasoning boundary and reduce generation diversity. We identify a root cause that existing methods overlook: the uniform penalization of errors. Current approaches -- whether data-filtering methods that select prompts by difficulty, or advantage normalization schemes -- treat all incorrect rollouts within a group identically. We show that this uniformity allows overconfident errors (incorrect reasoning paths that the RL process has spuriously reinforced) to persist and monopolize probability mass, ultimately suppressing valid exploratory trajectories. To address this, we propose the Asymmetric Confidence-aware Error Penalty (ACE). ACE introduces a per-rollout confidence shift metric, c_i = log(pi_theta(y_i|x) / pi_ref(y_i|x)), to dynamically modulate negative advantages. Theoretically, we demonstrate that ACE's gradient can be decomposed into the gradient of a selective regularizer restricted to overconfident errors, plus a well-characterized residual that partially moderates the regularizer's strength. We conduct extensive experiments fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B, Qwen3-8B-Base, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct on the DAPO-Math-17K dataset using GRPO and DAPO within the VERL framework.

To address this, we propose SEFMAP, a Subspace-Expert Fusion framework for robust multimodal HD map prediction. The key idea is to explicitly disentangle BEV features into four semantic subspaces: LiDAR-private, Image-private, Shared, and Interaction. Each subspace is assigned a dedicated expert, thereby preserving modality-specific cues while capturing cross-modal consensus. To adaptively combine expert outputs, we introduce an uncertainty-aware gating mechanism at the BEV-cell level, where unreliable experts are down-weighted based on predictive variance, complemented by a usage balance regularizer to prevent expert collapse. To enhance robustness in degraded conditions and promote role specialization, we further propose distribution-aware masking: during training, modality-drop scenarios are simulated using EMA-statistical surrogate features, and a specialization loss enforces distinct behaviors of private, shared, and interaction experts across complete and masked inputs. Experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse2 benchmarks demonstrate that SEFMAP achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing prior methods by +4.2% and +4.8% in mAP, respectively.

Under review at RLC 2026", "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) agents under partial observability often condition actions on internally accumulated information such as memory or inferred latent context. We formalise such information-conditioned interaction patterns as behavioural dependency: variation in action selection with respect to internal information under fixed observations. This induces a probe-relative notion of $\u03b5$-behavioural equivalence and a within-policy behavioural distance that quantifies probe sensitivity. We establish three structural results. First, the set of policies exhibiting non-trivial behavioural dependency is not closed under convex aggregation. Second, behavioural distance contracts under convex combination. Third, we prove a sufficient local condition under which gradient ascent on a skewed mixture objective decreases behavioural distance when a dominant-mode gradient aligns with the direction of steepest contraction. Minimal bandit and partially observable gridworld experiments provide controlled witnesses of these mechanisms. In the examined settings, behavioural distance decreases under convex aggregation and under continued optimisation with skewed latent priors, and in these experiments it precedes degradation under latent prior shift. These results identify structural conditions under which probe-conditioned behavioural separation is not preserved under common policy transformations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The key to unlocking this potential lies in making the entire compression process content-adaptive, ensuring that the encoder's representation and the decoder's generative prior are dynamically aligned with the semantic and structural characteristics of the input image. However, existing methods suffer from three critical limitations that prevent effective content adaptation. First, isotropic quantization applies a uniform quantization step, failing to adapt to the spatially varying complexity of image content and creating a misalignment with the diffusion model's noise-dependent prior. Second, the information concentration bottleneck -- arising from the dimensional mismatch between the high-dimensional noisy latent and the diffusion decoder's fixed input -- prevents the model from adaptively preserving essential semantic information in the primary channels. Third, existing textual conditioning strategies either need significant textual bitrate overhead or rely on generic, content-agnostic textual prompts, thereby failing to provide adaptive semantic guidance efficiently. To overcome these limitations, we propose a content-adaptive diffusion-based image codec with three technical innovations: 1) an Uncertainty-Guided Adaptive Quantization method that learns spatial uncertainty maps to adaptively align quantization distortion with content characteristics; 2) an Auxiliary Decoder-Guided Information Concentration method that uses a lightweight auxiliary decoder to enforce content-aware information preservation in the primary latent channels; and 3) a Bitrate-Free Adaptive Textual Conditioning method that derives content-aware textual descriptions from the auxiliary reconstructed image, enabling semantic guidance without bitrate cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5185\u5bb9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6269\u6563\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u6280\u672f\u521b\u65b0\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cf\u5316\u3001\u8f85\u52a9\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u4fe1\u606f\u96c6\u4e2d\u548c\u514d\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u5728\u6781\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u903c\u771f\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5185\u5bb9\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u5c40\u9650\uff1a\u5404\u5411\u540c\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u7a7a\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u96c6\u4e2d\u74f6\u9888\u65e0\u6cd5\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4fdd\u7559\u5fc5\u8981\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\u9700\u8981\u9ad8\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u6216\u4f7f\u7528\u901a\u7528\u63d0\u793a", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u6280\u672f\uff1a1)\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u56fe\u6765\u4f7f\u91cf\u5316\u5931\u771f\u4e0e\u5185\u5bb9\u7279\u5f81\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b2)\u8f85\u52a9\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u96c6\u4e2d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8f85\u52a9\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5728\u4e3b\u8981\u6f5c\u5728\u901a\u9053\u4e2d\u5b9e\u65bd\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u4fe1\u606f\u4fdd\u7559\uff1b3)\u514d\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u8f85\u52a9\u91cd\u5efa\u56fe\u50cf\u5bfc\u51fa\u5185\u5bb9\u611f\u77e5\u6587\u672c\u63cf\u8ff0", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u5185\u5bb9\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u964d\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u7387", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u5185\u5bb9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4e3a\u8d85\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u7387\u4e0b\u7684\u903c\u771f\u56fe\u50cf\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Our method belongs to the family of independence Metropolis-Hastings (IMH) sampling algorithms, which are common in Bayesian inference. Relying on the existence of an approximate posterior distribution that is cheaper to sample from but may have significant bias, we introduce Proximal-IMH, a scheme that removes this bias by correcting samples from the approximate posterior through an auxiliary optimization problem. This yields a local adjustment that trades off adherence to the exact model against stability around the approximate reference point. For idealized settings, we prove that the proximal correction tightens the match between approximate and exact posteriors, thereby improving acceptance rates and mixing. The method applies to both linear and nonlinear input-output operators and is particularly suitable for inverse problems where exact posterior sampling is too expensive. We present numerical experiments including multimodal and data-driven priors with nonlinear input-output operators.

In this work, we present the first systematic study of these embeddings and uncover a notable redundancy: class-conditioned embeddings exhibit extreme angular similarity, exceeding 99\\% on ImageNet-1K, while continuous-condition tasks such as pose-guided image generation and video-to-audio generation reach over 99.9\\%. We further find that semantic information is concentrated in a small subset of dimensions, with head dimensions carrying the dominant signal and tail dimensions contributing minimally. By pruning low-magnitude dimensions--removing up to two-thirds of the embedding space--we show that generation quality and fidelity remain largely unaffected, and in some cases improve. These results reveal a semantic bottleneck in Transformer-based diffusion models, providing new insights into how semantics are encoded and suggesting opportunities for more efficient conditioning mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Clinical practice has shifted toward stereotactic biopsy for pathological confirmation before treatment. Yet biopsy carries inherent risks of hemorrhage and neurological deficits and struggles with sampling bias due to tumor spatial heterogeneity, because pathological changes are typically region-selective rather than tumor-wide. Therefore, advancing non-invasive MRI-based pathology prediction is essential for holistic tumor assessment and modern clinical decision-making.\n  The primary challenge lies in data scarcity: low tumor incidence requires long collection cycles, and annotation demands biopsy-verified pathology from neurosurgical experts. Additionally, tiny lesion volumes lacking segmentation masks cause critical features to be overwhelmed by background noise. To address these challenges, we construct the ICT-MRI dataset - the first public biopsy-verified benchmark with 249 cases across four categories. We propose a Virtual Biopsy framework comprising: MRI-Processor for standardization; Tumor-Localizer employing vision-language models for coarse-to-fine localization via weak supervision; and Adaptive-Diagnoser with a Masked Channel Attention mechanism fusing local discriminative features with global contexts.

To address this challenge, we propose a causal decoding framework that applies targeted causal interventions during generation to curb spurious object mentions. By reshaping the decoding dynamics to attenuate spurious dependencies, our approach reduces false object tokens while maintaining descriptive quality.

However, this separation not only limits the effective use of heterogeneous condition signals that frequently arise in practice, but also prevents knowledge transfer between the two tasks. We present UniHand, a unified diffusion-based framework that formulates both estimation and generation as conditional motion synthesis. UniHand integrates heterogeneous inputs by embedding structured signals into a shared latent space through a joint variational autoencoder, which aligns conditions such as MANO parameters and 2D skeletons. Visual observations are encoded with a frozen vision backbone, while a dedicated hand perceptron extracts hand-specific cues directly from image features, removing the need for complex detection and cropping pipelines. A latent diffusion model then synthesizes consistent motion sequences from these diverse conditions. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that UniHand delivers robust and accurate hand motion modeling, maintaining performance under severe occlusions and temporally incomplete inputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While, in principle, all parameters including pole locations can be optimized via backpropagation through time (BPTT), such joint learning incurs substantial computational overhead and is often impractical for applications with limited training data. Echo state networks (ESNs) mitigate this limitation by fixing the recurrent dynamics and training only a linear readout, enabling efficient and stable online adaptation. In this work, we analytically and empirically examine why learning recurrent poles does not provide tangible benefits in data-constrained, real-time learning scenarios. Our analysis shows that pole learning renders the weight optimization problem highly non-convex, requiring significantly more training samples and iterations for gradient-based methods to converge to meaningful solutions. Empirically, we observe that for complex-valued data, gradient descent frequently exhibits prolonged plateaus, and advanced optimizers offer limited improvement. In contrast, fixed-pole architectures induce stable and well-conditioned state representations even with limited training data. Numerical results demonstrate that fixed-pole networks achieve superior performance with lower training complexity, making them more suitable for online real-time tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this multi-planar approach, the axial plane typically serves as the primary acquisition and diagnostic reference, while the coronal and sagittal planes provide complementary spatial information to increase diagnostic confidence. However, many existing 3D deep learning methods either process volumetric data holistically or assign equal importance to all planes, failing to reflect the axial-centric clinical interpretation workflow. To address this gap, we propose an axial-centric cross-plane attention architecture for 3D medical image classification that captures the inherent asymmetric dependencies between different anatomical planes. Our architecture incorporates MedDINOv3, a medical vision foundation model pretrained via self-supervised learning on large-scale axial CT images, as a frozen feature extractor for the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes. RICA blocks and intra-plane transformer encoders capture plane-specific positional and contextual information within each anatomical plane, while axial-centric cross-plane transformer encoders condition axial features on complementary information from auxiliary planes. Experimental results on six datasets from the MedMNIST3D benchmark demonstrate that the proposed architecture consistently outperforms existing 3D and multi-plane models in terms of accuracy and AUC. Ablation studies further confirm the importance of axial-centric query-key-value allocation and directional cross-plane fusion.

However, existing models overlook the heterogeneous and non-uniform organization of pathological regions of interest (ROIs) because they rely on natural image backbones not tailored for tissue morphology. Consequently, they often fail to capture the coherent tissue architecture beyond isolated patches, limiting interpretability and clinical relevance. To address these challenges, we present Cross-modal Adaptive Region Encoder (CARE), a foundation model for pathology that automatically partitions WSIs into several morphologically relevant regions. Specifically, CARE employs a two-stage pretraining strategy: (1) a self-supervised unimodal pretraining stage that learns morphological representations from 34,277 whole-slide images (WSIs) without segmentation annotations, and (2) a cross-modal alignment stage that leverages RNA and protein profiles to refine the construction and representation of adaptive regions. This molecular guidance enables CARE to identify biologically relevant patterns and generate irregular yet coherent tissue regions, selecting the most representative area as ROI. CARE supports a broad range of pathology-related tasks, using either the ROI feature or the slide-level feature obtained by aggregating adaptive regions. Based on only one-tenth of the pretraining data typically used by mainstream foundation models, CARE achieves superior average performance across 33 downstream benchmarks, including morphological classification, molecular prediction, and survival analysis, and outperforms other foundation model baselines overall.", "AI": {"tldr": "CARE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u81ea\u52a8\u5212\u5206WSI\u4e3a\u5f62\u6001\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u76f8\u5173\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5728\u5c11\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\u572833\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u81ea\u7136\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u75c5\u7406ROI\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u548c\u975e\u5747\u5300\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u548c\u4e34\u5e8a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1a(1)\u4ece34,277\u4e2aWSI\u65e0\u5206\u5272\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b66\u4e60\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u8868\u793a\uff1b(2)\u5229\u7528RNA\u548c\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8c31\u8fdb\u884c\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u7ec6\u5316\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u4e3b\u6d41\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5341\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u572833\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u5f62\u6001\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u5206\u5b50\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u751f\u5b58\u5206\u6790\uff09\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\uff0c\u603b\u4f53\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "CARE\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u5f62\u6001\u5b66\u8868\u793a\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5b50\u5f15\u5bfc\u8bc6\u522b\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u76f8\u5173\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7ec4\u7ec7\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4e3a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u75c5\u7406\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u7684\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

A fundamental operation of such networks is the tensor product, which allows interaction between different feature types. Because this operation scales poorly, there has been considerable work towards accelerating this interaction. However, recently \\citet{xieprice} have pointed out that most speedups come from a reduction in expressivity rather than true algorithmic improvements on computing Clebsch-Gordan tensor products. A modification of Gaunt tensor product \\citep{gaunt} can give a true asymptotic speedup but is incomplete and misses many interactions. In this work, we provide the first complete algorithm which truly provides asymptotic benefits Clebsch-Gordan tensor products. For full CGTP, our algorithm brings runtime complexity from the naive $O(L^6)$ to $O(L^4\\log^2 L)$, close to the lower bound of $O(L^4)$.

Preliminary work", "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a central post-training paradigm for large language models (LLMs), but its performance is highly sensitive to the quality of training problems. This sensitivity stems from the non-stationarity of RL: rollouts are generated by an evolving policy, and learning is shaped by exploration and reward feedback, unlike supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with fixed trajectories. As a result, prior work often relies on manual curation or simple heuristic filters (e.g., accuracy), which can admit incorrect or low-utility problems. We propose GradAlign, a gradient-aligned data selection method for LLM reinforcement learning that uses a small, trusted validation set to prioritize training problems whose policy gradients align with validation gradients, yielding an adaptive curriculum. We evaluate GradAlign across three challenging data regimes: unreliable reward signals, distribution imbalance, and low-utility training corpus, showing that GradAlign consistently outperforms existing baselines, underscoring the importance of directional gradient signals in navigating non-stationary policy optimization and yielding more stable training and improved final performance.

Most world models represent the transition function with unstructured neural networks, limiting interpretability, sample efficiency, and generalization to unseen states or action compositions. We address these issues with a generalizable world model grounded in Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) principles as geometric priors. Our approach utilizes learnable Fourier Holographic Reduced Representation (FHRR) encoders to map states and actions into a high dimensional complex vector space with learned group structure and models transitions with element-wise complex multiplication. We formalize the framework's group theoretic foundation and show how training such structured representations to be approximately invariant enables strong multi-step composition directly in latent space and generalization performances over various experiments. On a discrete grid world environment, our model achieves 87.5% zero shot accuracy to unseen state-action pairs, obtains 53.6% higher accuracy on 20-timestep horizon rollouts, and demonstrates 4x higher robustness to noise relative to an MLP baseline.

Unfortunately, existing approaches to learning policies for such collaborative problems produce brittle solutions that fail when paired with new partners. We attribute these failures to a combination of free-riding during training and a lack of strategic robustness. To address these problems, we study the concept of strategic risk aversion and interpret it as a principled inductive bias for generalizable cooperation with unseen partners. While strategically risk-averse players are robust to deviations in their partner's behavior by design, we show that, in collaborative games, they also (1) can have better equilibrium outcomes than those at classical game-theoretic concepts like Nash, and (2) exhibit less or no free-riding. Inspired by these insights, we develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithm that integrates strategic risk aversion into standard policy optimization methods.

Because human annotations reflect subjective preferences and expertise, ground-truth captions are often incomplete or even incorrect, which in turn limits caption models. We argue that caption quality should be assessed by two objective aspects: completeness (does the caption cover all salient visual facts?) and correctness (are the descriptions true with respect to the image?). To this end, we introduce CCCaption: a dual-reward reinforcement learning framework with a dedicated fine-tuning corpus that explicitly optimizes these properties to generate \\textbf{C}omplete and \\textbf{C}orrect \\textbf{Captions}. For completeness, we use diverse LVLMs to disentangle the image into a set of visual queries, and reward captions that answer more of these queries, with a dynamic query sampling strategy to improve training efficiency. For correctness, we penalize captions that contain hallucinations by validating the authenticity of sub-caption queries, which are derived from the caption decomposition. Our symmetric dual-reward optimization jointly maximizes completeness and correctness, guiding models toward captions that better satisfy these objective criteria.

While training-free conditional generation is well developed for diffusion models, corresponding conditioning and posterior sampling strategies for Flow Matching (FM) priors remain comparatively under-explored, especially on scientific benchmarks where fidelity must be assessed beyond measurement misfit. In this work, we study training-free conditional generation for scientific inverse problems under FM priors and organize existing inference-time strategies by where measurement information is injected: (i) guided transport dynamics that perturb sampling trajectories using likelihood information, and (ii) source-distribution inference that performs posterior inference over the source variable while keeping the learned transport fixed. Building on the latter, we propose D-Flow SGLD, a source-space posterior sampling method that augments differentiable source inference with preconditioned stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, enabling scalable exploration of the source posterior induced by new measurement operators without retraining the prior or modifying the learned FM dynamics. We benchmark representative methods from both families on a hierarchy of problems: 2D toy posteriors, chaotic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky trajectories, and wall-bounded turbulence reconstruction. Across these settings, we quantify trade-offs among measurement assimilation, posterior diversity, and physics/statistics fidelity, and establish D-Flow SGLD as a practical FM-compatible posterior sampler for scientific inverse problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Human-AI collaboration seeks to enhance the reliability of diagnostic models by integrating the behaviors of controllable radiologists. However, the absence of interactive tools seamlessly embedded within diagnostic routines impedes collaboration, while the semantic gap between radiologists' decision-making patterns and model representations further limits clinical adoption. To overcome these limitations, we propose a visual cognition-guided collaborative network (VCC-Net) to achieve the cooperative diagnostic paradigm. VCC-Net centers on visual cognition (VC) and employs clinically compatible interfaces, such as eye-tracking or the mouse, to capture radiologists' visual search traces and attention patterns during diagnosis. VCC-Net employs VC as a spatial cognition guide, learning hierarchical visual search strategies to localize diagnostically key regions. A cognition-graph co-editing module subsequently integrates radiologist VC with model inference to construct a disease-aware graph. The module captures dependencies among anatomical regions and aligns model representations with VC-driven features, mitigating radiologist bias and facilitating complementary, transparent decision-making. Experiments on the public datasets SIIM-ACR, EGD-CXR, and self-constructed TB-Mouse dataset achieved classification accuracies of 88.40%, 85.05%, and 92.41%, respectively. The attention maps produced by VCC-Net exhibit strong concordance with radiologists' gaze distributions, demonstrating a mutual reinforcement of radiologist and model inference.

Diverging from previous approaches, we introduce the first tri-modal masked diffusion model pretrained from scratch on text, image-text, and audio-text data. We systematically analyze multimodal scaling laws, modality mixing ratios, noise schedules, and batch-size effects, and we provide optimized inference sampling defaults. Our batch-size analysis yields a novel stochastic differential equation (SDE)-based reparameterization that eliminates the need for tuning the optimal batch size as reported in recent work. This reparameterization decouples the physical batch size, often chosen based on compute constraints (GPU saturation, FLOP efficiency, wall-clock time), from the logical batch size, chosen to balance gradient variance during stochastic optimization. Finally, we pretrain a preliminary 3B-parameter tri-modal model on 6.4T tokens, demonstrating the capabilities of a unified design and achieving strong results in text generation, text-to-image tasks, and text-to-speech tasks.

We introduce QPoint2Comm, a quantized point-cloud communication framework that dramatically reduces bandwidth while preserving high-fidelity 3D information. Instead of transmitting intermediate features, QPoint2Comm directly communicates quantized point-cloud indices using a shared codebook, enabling efficient reconstruction with lower bandwidth than feature-based methods. To ensure robustness to possible communication packet loss, we employ a masked training strategy that simulates random packet loss, allowing the model to maintain strong performance even under severe transmission failures.

Preprint", "summary": "Robust watermarking is critical for intellectual property protection, whereas existing methods face a severe vulnerability against regeneration-based AIGC attacks. We identify that existing methods fail because they entangle the watermark with high-frequency cover texture, which is susceptible to being rewritten during generative purification. To address this, we propose WaterVIB, a theoretically grounded framework that reformulates the encoder as an information sieve via the Variational Information Bottleneck. Instead of overfitting to fragile cover details, our approach forces the model to learn a Minimal Sufficient Statistic of the message.

For robust scene flow, learning-based approaches have recently achieved impressive results using either image-based or LiDAR-based modalities. However, these methods have tended to focus on the use of a single modality. To tackle these problems, we present a deep learning architecture, SF3D-RGB, that enables sparse scene flow estimation using 2D monocular images and 3D point clouds (e.g., acquired by LiDAR) as inputs. Our architecture is an end-to-end model that first encodes information from each modality into features and fuses them together. Then, the fused features enhance a graph matching module for better and more robust mapping matrix computation to generate an initial scene flow. Finally, a residual scene flow module further refines the initial scene flow. Our model is designed to strike a balance between accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, experiments show that our proposed method outperforms single-modality methods and achieves better scene flow accuracy on real-world datasets while using fewer parameters compared to other state-of-the-art methods with fusion.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Our evaluation includes GPT-style models ranging from 130M to 774M parameters and LLaMA-style models ranging from 60M to 1B parameters.

While deep learning models achieve strong performance under stationary conditions, their accuracy often degrades significantly when faced with distribution shifts caused by external events or evolving urban dynamics. Frequent model retraining to adapt to such changes incurs prohibitive computational costs, especially for large-scale or foundation models. To address this challenge, we propose FORESEE (Forecasting Online with Residual Smoothing and Ensemble Experts), a lightweight online adaptation framework that is accurate, robust, and computationally efficient. FORESEE operates without any parameter updates to the base model. Instead, it corrects today's forecast in each region using yesterday's prediction error, stabilized through exponential smoothing guided by a mixture-of-experts mechanism that adapts to recent error dynamics. Moreover, an adaptive spatiotemporal smoothing component propagates error signals across neighboring regions and time slots, capturing coherent shifts in demand patterns. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets with three backbone models demonstrate that FORESEE consistently improves prediction accuracy, maintains robustness even when distribution shifts are minimal (avoiding performance degradation), and achieves the lowest computational overhead among existing online methods. By enabling real-time adaptation of traffic forecasting models with negligible computational cost, FORESEE paves the way for deploying reliable, up-to-date prediction systems in dynamic urban environments.

Previous works often focus on extending input sequence length to locate distal enhancers, which may influence target genes from hundreds of kilobases away. Our work first reveals that for current models, long sequence modeling can decrease performance. Even carefully designed algorithms only mitigate the performance degradation caused by long sequences. Instead, we find that proximal multimodal epigenomic signals near target genes prove more essential. Hence we focus on how to better integrate these signals, which has been overlooked. We find that different signal types serve distinct biological roles, with some directly marking active regulatory elements while others reflect background chromatin patterns that may introduce confounding effects. Simple concatenation may lead models to develop spurious associations with these background patterns. To address this challenge, we propose Prism, a framework that learns multiple combinations of high-dimensional epigenomic features to represent distinct background chromatin states and uses backdoor adjustment to mitigate confounding effects. Our experimental results demonstrate that proper modeling of multimodal epigenomic signals achieves state-of-the-art performance using only short sequences for gene expression prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this issue, we develop generalisation theory for RLHF that explicitly accounts for (1) \\emph{reward shift}: reward models are trained on preference data from earlier or mixed behaviour policies while RLHF optimises the current policy on its own rollouts; and (2) \\emph{clipped KL regularisation}: the KL regulariser is estimated from sampled log-probability ratios and then clipped for stabilisation, resulting in an error to RLHF. We present generalisation bounds for RLHF, suggesting that the generalisation error stems from a sampling error from prompts and rollouts, a reward shift error, and a KL clipping error. We also discuss special cases of (1) initialising RLHF parameters with a uniform prior over a finite space, and (2) training RLHF by stochastic gradient descent, as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The theory yields practical implications in (1) optimal KL clipping threshold, and (2) budget allocation in prompts, rollouts, and preference data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2aRLHF\u6cdb\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u5956\u52b1\u6f02\u79fb\u548cKL\u526a\u679d\u8bef\u5dee\u5bf9\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9RLHF\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\u5c1a\u4e0d\u6210\u719f\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5f53\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u4f1a\u53d1\u751f\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u800cKL\u63a7\u5236\u9879\u662f\u4f30\u8ba1\u5e76\u7ecf\u8fc7\u526a\u679d\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u3002", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86RLHF\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u7406\u8bba\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8003\u8651\u4e86(1)\u5956\u52b1\u6f02\u79fb\uff1a\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65e9\u671f\u6216\u6df7\u5408\u884c\u4e3a\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u800cRLHF\u5728\u5f53\u524d\u7b56\u7565\u81ea\u5df1\u7684rollouts\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4f18\u5316\uff1b(2)\u526a\u679dKL\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff1aKL\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u662f\u4ece\u91c7\u6837\u7684\u5bf9\u6570\u6982\u7387\u6bd4\u4f30\u8ba1\u5e76\u526a\u679d\u4ee5\u7a33\u5b9a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86RLHF\u6cdb\u5316\u8fb9\u754c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6cdb\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u6e90\u81ea\u63d0\u793a\u548crollouts\u7684\u91c7\u6837\u8bef\u5dee\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u6f02\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u548cKL\u526a\u679d\u8bef\u5dee\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7406\u8bba\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u6307\u5bfc\u610f\u4e49\uff1a(1)\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u4f18KL\u526a\u679d\u9608\u503c\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff0c(2)\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u3001rollouts\u548c\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\u4e4b\u95f4\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u7b97\u5206\u914d\u7684\u5efa\u8bae\u3002"}}

Submitted to CVPR 2026", "summary": "Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for deepfake detection excel at identifying spatial artifacts but overlook a critical dimension: temporal inconsistencies in video forgeries. Adapting VLMs to reason about these dynamic cues remains a distinct challenge. To bridge this gap, we propose Forensic Answer-Questioning (FAQ), a large-scale benchmark that formulates temporal deepfake analysis as a multiple-choice task. FAQ introduces a three-level hierarchy to progressively evaluate and equip VLMs with forensic capabilities: (1) Facial Perception, testing the ability to identify static visual artifacts; (2) Temporal Deepfake Grounding, requiring the localization of dynamic forgery artifacts across frames; and (3) Forensic Reasoning, challenging models to synthesize evidence for final authenticity verdicts. We evaluate a range of VLMs on FAQ and generate a corresponding instruction-tuning set, FAQ-IT. Extensive experiments show that models fine-tuned on FAQ-IT achieve advanced performance on both in-domain and cross-dataset detection benchmarks. Ablation studies further validate the impact of our key design choices, confirming that FAQ is the driving force behind the temporal reasoning capabilities of these VLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86FAQ\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u5206\u6790\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u591a\u9009\u9898\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u5c42\u7ea7\u8bc4\u4f30\u8ba9VLM\u5177\u5907\u53d6\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u96c6\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(VLMs)\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u65f6\u64c5\u957f\u8bc6\u522b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f2a\u5f71\uff0c\u4f46\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u89c6\u9891\u4f2a\u9020\u4e2d\u5173\u952e\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u8ba9VLM\u80fd\u591f\u5bf9\u52a8\u6001\u7ebf\u7d22\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faForensic Answer-Questioning (FAQ)\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u5c42\u7ea7\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff1a\u9762\u90e8\u611f\u77e5\uff08\u9759\u6001\u4f2a\u5f71\u8bc6\u522b\uff09\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff08\u8de8\u5e27\u52a8\u6001\u4f2a\u5f71\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff09\u3001\u53d6\u8bc1\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u8bc1\u636e\u5408\u6210\u5224\u65ad\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4efb\u52a1\u6784\u5efa\u4e3a\u591a\u9009\u9898\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18\u96c6FAQ-IT\u3002", "result": "\u5728FAQ\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u79cdVLM\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u5728FAQ-IT\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u57df\u5185\u548c\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u90fd\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u786e\u8ba4FAQ\u662fVLM\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u9a71\u52a8\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "FAQ\u57fa\u51c6\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u5f15\u5165\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e09\u5c42\u7ea7\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347VLMs\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u53d6\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u9891\u4f2a\u9020\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

A recent study has shown that deep learning can produce stand delineations comparable to expert interpreters when combining aerial imagery and airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. However, temporal misalignment between data sources limits operational scalability. Canopy height models (CHMs) derived from digital photogrammetry (DAP) offer better temporal alignment but may smoothen canopy surface and canopy gaps, raising the question of whether they can reliably replace ALS-derived CHMs. Similarly, the inclusion of a digital terrain model (DTM) has been suggested to improve delineation performance, but has remained untested in published literature. Using expert-delineated forest stands as reference data, we assessed a U-Net-based semantic segmentation framework with municipality-level cross-validation across six municipalities in southeastern Norway. We compared multispectral aerial imagery combined with (i) an ALS-derived CHM, (ii) a DAP-derived CHM, and (iii) a DAP-derived CHM in combination with a DTM. Results showed comparable performance across all data combinations, reaching overall accuracy values between 0.90-0.91. Agreement between model predictions was substantially larger than agreement with the reference data, highlighting both model consistency and the inherent subjectivity of stand delineation. The similar performance of DAP-CHMs, despite the reduced structural detail, and the lack of improvements of the DTM indicate that the framework is resilient to variations in input data.

Further extending GFlowNets to multi-objective settings has attracted growing interest since real-world applications often involve multiple, conflicting objectives. However, existing approaches require additional training for each set of objectives, limiting their applicability and incurring substantial computational overhead. We propose a training-free mixing policy that composes pre-trained GFlowNets at inference time, enabling rapid adaptation without finetuning or retraining. Importantly, our framework is flexible, capable of handling diverse reward combinations ranging from linear scalarization to complex non-linear logical operators, which are often handled separately in previous literature. We prove that our method exactly recovers the target distribution for linear scalarization and quantify the approximation quality for nonlinear operators through a distortion factor. Experiments on a synthetic 2D grid and real-world molecule-generation tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to baselines that require additional training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ec4\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684GFlowNets\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5feb\u901f\u9002\u5e94\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9488\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u8bbe\u7f6e\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u76ee\u6807\u96c6\u5408\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u4e14\u5e94\u7528\u53d7\u9650\uff0c\u5e0c\u671b\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u591a\u79cd\u5956\u52b1\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684GFlowNets\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u6df7\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u4ece\u7ebf\u6027\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u5230\u590d\u6742\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u903b\u8f91\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u7ec4\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u62102D\u7f51\u683c\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u9700\u8981\u989d\u5916\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u76f8\u5f53\uff1b\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u51c6\u786e\u6062\u590d\u76ee\u6807\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5bf9\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7b97\u5b50\u901a\u8fc7\u5931\u771f\u56e0\u5b50\u91cf\u5316\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7075\u6d3b\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u514d\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u76ee\u6807\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e3a\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u7b49\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u7684\u9886\u57df\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Unlike traditional optimizers that treat all parameters uniformly, Excitation dynamically modulates updates using batch-level expert utilization. It introduces a competitive update dynamic that amplifies updates to highly-utilized experts and can selectively suppress low-utilization ones, effectively sharpening routing specialization. Notably, we identify a phenomenon of \"structural confusion\" in deep MoEs, where standard optimizers fail to establish functional signal paths; Excitation acts as a specialization catalyst, \"rescuing\" these models and enabling stable training where baselines remain trapped. Excitation is optimizer-, domain-, and model-agnostic, requires minimal integration effort, and introduces neither additional per-parameter optimizer state nor learnable parameters, making it highly viable for memory-constrained settings.

Moreover, transformer-based self-attention introduces substantial computational overhead because of its quadratic complexity (O(n^2)), making it inefficient for high-resolution dental images. To address these challenges, we introduce a three-stage encoder with hierarchical feature representation to capture scale-adaptive information in dental images. By jointly leveraging low-level details and high-level semantics through cross-scale feature fusion, the model effectively preserves fine structural information while maintaining strong contextual awareness. Furthermore, a bidirectional sequence modeling strategy is incorporated to enhance global spatial context understanding without incurring high computational cost.\n  We validate our method on two dental datasets, with experimental results demonstrating its superiority over existing approaches. On the OralVision dataset, our model achieves a 1.1% improvement in mean intersection over union (mIoU).", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing methods use a calibrated scalar evaluator for the target objective to guide search, but for many tasks such scores are unavailable, too sparse, or unreliable. Pairwise comparisons, by contrast, are often easier to elicit, still provide useful signal on improvement directions, and can be obtained from the LLM itself without external supervision. Building on this observation, we introduce Duel-Evolve, an evolutionary optimization algorithm that replaces external scalar rewards with pairwise preferences elicited from the same LLM used to generate candidates. Duel-Evolve aggregates these noisy candidate comparisons via a Bayesian Bradley-Terry model, yielding uncertainty-aware estimates of candidate quality. These quality estimates guide allocation of the comparison budget toward plausible optima using Double Thompson Sampling, as well as selection of high-quality parents to generate improved candidates. We evaluate Duel-Evolve on MathBench, where it achieves 20 percentage points higher accuracy over existing methods and baselines, and on LiveCodeBench, where it improves over comparable iterative methods by over 12 percentage points. Notably, the method requires no reward model, no ground-truth labels during search, and no hand-crafted scoring function.

While recent progress in fMRI-based image reconstruction has been notable, extending this success to video reconstruction remains a significant challenge. Current fMRI-to-video reconstruction approaches consistently encounter two major shortcomings: (i) inconsistent visual representations of salient objects across frames, leading to appearance mismatches; (ii) poor temporal coherence, resulting in motion misalignment or abrupt frame transitions. To address these limitations, we introduce SemVideo, a novel fMRI-to-video reconstruction framework guided by hierarchical semantic information. At the core of SemVideo is SemMiner, a hierarchical guidance module that constructs three levels of semantic cues from the original video stimulus: static anchor descriptions, motion-oriented narratives, and holistic summaries. Leveraging this semantic guidance, SemVideo comprises three key components: a Semantic Alignment Decoder that aligns fMRI signals with CLIP-style embeddings derived from SemMiner, a Motion Adaptation Decoder that reconstructs dynamic motion patterns using a novel tripartite attention fusion architecture, and a Conditional Video Render that leverages hierarchical semantic guidance for video reconstruction.

This phenomenon causes attention dilution, thereby hindering effective fusion between semantic and artifact features.

Our contributions are threefold: we adapt multiple shooting and an observer-based prediction-error method (PEM) to stabilize identification of neural-augmented epidemiological dynamics across intervention-driven regime shifts; we enforce positivity and mass conservation and show the learned contact-rate parameterization yields a well-posed vector field; and we quantify accuracy, calibration, and compute against ABM ensembles and UDE baselines. On a representative ExaEpi scenario, PEM-UDE reduces mean MSE by 77% relative to single-shooting UDE (3.00 vs. 13.14) and by 20% relative to MS-UDE (3.75). Reliability improves in parallel: empirical coverage of ABM $10$-$90$% and $25$-$75$% bands rises from 0.68/0.43 (UDE) and 0.79/0.55 (MS-UDE) to 0.86/0.61 with PEM-UDE and 0.94/0.69 with MS+PEM-UDE, indicating calibrated uncertainty rather than overconfident fits. Inference runs in seconds on commodity CPUs (20-35 s per $\\sim$90-day forecast), enabling nightly ''what-if'' sweeps on a laptop. Relative to a $\\sim$100 CPU-hour ABM reference run, this yields $\\sim10^{4}\\times$ lower wall-clock per scenario. This closes the realism-cadence gap, supports threshold-aware decision-making (e.g., maintaining ICU occupancy $<75$%), preserves mechanistic interpretability, and enables calibrated, risk-aware scenario planning on standard institutional hardware. Beyond epidemics, the ABM$\\to$UDE recipe provides a portable path to distill agent-based simulators into fast, trustworthy surrogates for other scientific domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Consequently, training representation models usually requires cropping or interpolating along the z-axis to obtain fixed-size blocks, which inevitably causes information loss. We propose a new training approach to overcome this limitation. Instead of absolute position embeddings, we interpret volumes as sequences of 3D chunks and adopt Rotary Position Embeddings, allowing us to treat the z-axis as an unconstrained temporal dimensions. Building on this idea, we introduce a new vision-language model: SigVLP. In SigVLP, we implement Rotary Position Embedding as the positional encoding method, which is applied directly within the attention operation, generating input-conditioned sine and cosine weights on the fly. This design ensures consistent alignment between query and key projections and adapts to any input sizes. To allow for variable input size during training, we sample Computed Tomography volumes in chunks and pair them with localized organ-wise textual observations. Compared to using entire reports for conditioning, chunkwise alignment provides finer-grained supervision, enabling the model to establish stronger correlations between the text and volume representations, thereby improving the precision of text-to-volume alignment.

Traditional noise-layer-based watermarking, however, remains vulnerable to inversion attacks that can recover embedded signals. To mitigate this, recent content-aware semantic watermarking schemes bind watermark signals to high-level image semantics, constraining local edits that would otherwise disrupt global coherence. Yet, large language models (LLMs) possess structured reasoning capabilities that enable targeted exploration of semantic spaces, allowing locally fine-grained but globally coherent semantic alterations that invalidate such bindings. To expose this overlooked vulnerability, we introduce a Coherence-Preserving Semantic Injection (CSI) attack that leverages LLM-guided semantic manipulation under embedding-space similarity constraints. This alignment enforces visual-semantic consistency while selectively perturbing watermark-relevant semantics, ultimately inducing detector misclassification. Extensive empirical results show that CSI consistently outperforms prevailing attack baselines against content-aware semantic watermarking, revealing a fundamental security weakness of current semantic watermark designs when confronted with LLM-driven semantic perturbations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

It offers a documented API that takes as input raw tabular data in pandas DataFrame form, a preprocessing object (for standardization and encoding), and a trained scikit-learn or PyTorch model. On this basis, users can either employ the built-in or externally imported CE generators. The library also implements several sparsification policies and includes visualization routines for analysing and comparing sparsified counterfactuals. xai-cola is released under the MIT license and can be installed from PyPI.

Unlike pure-text LLMs, multimodal models are particularly sensitive to such distortions, as both perceptual and reasoning errors influence their responses. To address this, we characterize each sample by its difficulty, defined through perceptual complexity (measured via visual entropy) and reasoning uncertainty (captured by model confidence).

Stress mainly occurs at the interface between different materials. We investigate stress image using latent space representation which is based on using deep generative model (DGM). However, most DGM approaches are unsupervised, meaning they resort to image pairing (input and output) to train DGM. Instead, we rely on a recent boundary-decoder (BD) net, which uses boundary condition and image pairing for stress modeling. The boundary net maps material parameters to the latent space co-shared by its image counterpart. Because such a setup is dimensionally wise ill-posed, we further couple BD net with deep clustering. To access the performance of our proposed method, we simulate an IC chip dataset comprising of 1825 stress images. We compare our new approach using variants of BD net as well as a baseline approach.

This ``one-size-fits-all'' strategy often neglects model-specific and task-specific preferences, resulting in inaccurate or over-lengthy responses to graph-related queries. To address this, we propose the $\\mbox{DynamicGTR}$ framework, which dynamically selects the optimal GTR for each query during inference, thereby enhancing the zero-shot graph QA capabilities of VLMs with a customizable accuracy and brevity trade-off. Extensive experiments show that DynamicGTR not only improves VLM-based graph algorithm QA performance but also successfully transfers the experience trained from synthetic graph algorithm tasks to real-world applications like link prediction and node classification, without any additional training.

To enable effective fusion, calibrating directly from natural driving scenes (i.e., target-free) with high accuracy is crucial for precise multi-sensor alignment.

Unlike these methods, we propose LiREC-Net, a target-free, learning-based calibration network that jointly calibrates multiple sensor modality pairs, including LiDAR, RGB, and event data, within a unified framework. To reduce redundant computation and improve efficiency, we introduce a shared LiDAR representation that leverages features from both its 3D nature and projected depth map, ensuring better consistency across modalities.

In practice, LTV data patterns vary across decision scenarios. As a result, practitioners often build complex, scenario-specific pipelines and iterate over feature processing, objective design, and tuning. This process is expensive and hard to transfer. We propose AgentLTV, an agent-based unified search-and-evolution framework for automated LTV modeling. AgentLTV treats each candidate solution as an {executable pipeline program}. LLM-driven agents generate code, run and repair pipelines, and analyze execution feedback. Two decision agents coordinate a two-stage search. The Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) stage explores a broad space of modeling choices under a fixed budget, guided by the Polynomial Upper Confidence bounds for Trees criterion and a Pareto-aware multi-metric value function. The Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) stage refines the best MCTS program via island-based evolution with crossover, mutation, and migration. Experiments on a large-scale proprietary dataset and a public benchmark show that AgentLTV consistently discovers strong models across ranking and error metrics. Online bucket-level analysis further indicates improved ranking consistency and value calibration, especially for high-value and negative-LTV segments. We summarize practitioner-oriented takeaways: use MCTS for rapid adaptation to new data patterns, use EA for stable refinement, and validate deployment readiness with bucket-level ranking and calibration diagnostics.

We introduce an automated framework for CAC detection and lesion-specific Agatston scoring that operates across both gated and non-gated CT scans. At its core is CARD-ViT, a self-supervised Vision Transformer trained exclusively on gated CT data using DINO. Without any non-gated training data, our framework achieves 0.707 accuracy and a Cohen's kappa of 0.528 on the Stanford non-gated dataset, matching models trained directly on non-gated scans. On gated test sets, the framework achieves 0.910 accuracy with Cohen's kappa scores of 0.871 and 0.874 across independent datasets, demonstrating robust risk stratification.

Nevertheless, current diffusion acceleration methods based on distributed parallelism suffer from noticeable generation artifacts and fail to achieve substantial acceleration proportional to the number of GPUs. Therefore, we propose a hybrid parallelism framework that combines a novel data parallel strategy, condition-based partitioning, with an optimal pipeline scheduling method, adaptive parallelism switching, to reduce generation latency and achieve high generation quality in conditional diffusion models. The key ideas are to (i) leverage the conditional and unconditional denoising paths as a new data-partitioning perspective and (ii) adaptively enable optimal pipeline parallelism according to the denoising discrepancy between these two paths. Our framework achieves $2.31\\times$ and $2.07\\times$ latency reductions on SDXL and SD3, respectively, using two NVIDIA RTX~3090 GPUs, while preserving image quality. This result confirms the generality of our approach across U-Net-based diffusion models and DiT-based flow-matching architectures. Our approach also outperforms existing methods in acceleration under high-resolution synthesis settings.

Traditional filtering approaches often over-smooth and lose fine anatomical details, while deep learning methods, including CNNs, GANs, and transformers, may struggle to preserve such details or require large, computationally expensive models, limiting clinical practicality.\n  We propose PatchDenoiser, a lightweight, energy-efficient multi-scale patch-based denoising framework. It decomposes denoising into local texture extraction and global context aggregation, fused via a spatially aware patch fusion strategy. This design enables effective noise suppression while preserving fine structural and anatomical details. PatchDenoiser is ultra-lightweight, with far fewer parameters and lower computational complexity than CNN-, GAN-, and transformer-based denoisers.\n  On the 2016 Mayo Low-Dose CT dataset, PatchDenoiser consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CNN- and GAN-based methods in PSNR and SSIM. It is robust to variations in slice thickness, reconstruction kernels, and HU windows, generalizes across scanners without fine-tuning, and reduces parameters by ~9x and energy consumption per inference by ~27x compared with conventional CNN denoisers.\n  PatchDenoiser thus provides a practical, scalable, and computationally efficient solution for medical image denoising, balancing performance, robustness, and clinical deployability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In various challenging problems from the literature, these errors are observable, i.e., they emit a known error output. Motivated by these problems, we study learning these systems more efficiently.

We attribute this limitation to the dominant paradigm that treats editing as a discrete mapping between image pairs, which provides only boundary conditions and leaves transition dynamics underspecified. To address this, we reformulate physics-aware editing as predictive physical state transitions and introduce PhysicTran38K, a large-scale video-based dataset comprising 38K transition trajectories across five physical domains, constructed via a two-stage filtering and constraint-aware annotation pipeline. Building on this supervision, we propose PhysicEdit, an end-to-end framework equipped with a textual-visual dual-thinking mechanism. It combines a frozen Qwen2.5-VL for physically grounded reasoning with learnable transition queries that provide timestep-adaptive visual guidance to a diffusion backbone. Experiments show that PhysicEdit improves over Qwen-Image-Edit by 5.9% in physical realism and 10.1% in knowledge-grounded editing, setting a new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, while remaining competitive with leading proprietary models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u4ee4\u5f0f\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7269\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\uff08\u5982\u6298\u5c04\u3001\u6750\u8d28\u53d8\u5f62\uff09\u5f80\u5f80\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7f16\u8f91\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u7269\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u65b0\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u5f0f\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u590d\u6742\u56e0\u679c\u52a8\u6001\uff08\u5982\u6298\u5c04\u6216\u6750\u8d28\u53d8\u5f62\uff09\u65f6\uff0c\u7ecf\u5e38\u65e0\u6cd5\u751f\u6210\u7269\u7406\u4e0a\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u4e3b\u6d41\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u7f16\u8f91\u89c6\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6620\u5c04\uff0c\u8fd9\u4ec5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8fb9\u754c\u6761\u4ef6\u800c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u6307\u5b9a\u8f6c\u6362\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7f16\u8f91\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u7269\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u5305\u542b38K\u6761\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684PhysicTran38K\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8fc7\u6ee4\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u6807\u6ce8\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86PhysicEdit\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u6587\u672c-\u89c6\u89c9\u53cc\u601d\u7ef4\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684Qwen2.5-VL\u8fdb\u884c\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\u67e5\u8be2\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u4e3b\u5e72\u63d0\u4f9b\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPhysicEdit\u5728\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u5ea6\u4e0a\u6bd4Qwen-Image-Edit\u63d0\u5347\u4e865.9%\uff0c\u5728\u77e5\u8bc6\u57fa\u7840\u7f16\u8f91\u4e0a\u63d0\u5347\u4e8610.1%\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u6e90\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bbe\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0e\u9886\u5148\u7684\u4e13\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7f16\u8f91\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u72b6\u6001\u8f6c\u6362\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u89c6\u9891\u76d1\u7763\u548c\u53cc\u601d\u7ef4\u673a\u5236\uff0cPhysicEdit\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u56e0\u679c\u52a8\u6001\u65f6\u7684\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u7269\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u7684\u6311\u6218\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Conventional physics-based models provide interpretability but struggle with real-world variability, while purely data-driven approaches achieve accuracy at the expense of physical plausibility. This paper introduces a Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (PI-KAN), a hybrid method that integrates interpretable univariate feature transformations with a physics-informed loss function and a leakage-free chained prediction pipeline. Using operational and environmental data from five cargo vessels, PI-KAN consistently outperforms the traditional polynomial method and neural network baselines. The model achieves the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE), and the highest coefficient of determination (R^2) for shaft power and fuel consumption across all vessels, while maintaining physically consistent behavior. Interpretability analysis reveals rediscovery of domain-consistent dependencies, such as cubic-like speed-power relationships and cosine-like wave and wind effects. These results demonstrate that PI-KAN achieves both predictive accuracy and interpretability, offering a robust tool for vessel performance monitoring and decision support in operational settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, due to fundamental challenges in modality alignment, existing methods often struggle to effectively incorporate multimodal data into predictions, particularly textual information that has a causal influence on time series fluctuations, such as emergency reports and policy announcements. In this paper, we reflect on the role of textual information in numerical forecasting and propose Time series transformers with Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts, TiMi, to unleash the causal reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Concretely, TiMi utilizes LLMs to generate inferences on future developments, which serve as guidance for time series forecasting. To seamlessly integrate both exogenous factors and time series into predictions, we introduce a Multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MMoE) module as a lightweight plug-in to empower Transformer-based time series models for multimodal forecasting, eliminating the need for explicit representation-level alignment. Experimentally, our proposed TiMi demonstrates consistent state-of-the-art performance on sixteen real-world multimodal forecasting benchmarks, outperforming advanced baselines while offering both strong adaptability and interpretability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faTiMi\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u9762\u4e34\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5bf9\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u529e\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u800c\u6587\u672c\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u6570\u503c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u7684\u6ce2\u52a8\u53ef\u80fd\u5177\u6709\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u3002\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u7684\u6570\u503c\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6587\u672c\u8bcd\u8fbe\u7247\u7b49\u5916\u90e8\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u5ea6\uff0c\u662f\u5f53\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u5927\u6a21\u578b(LLM)\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u53d8\u63a5\u5668\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b(TiMi)\u3002TiMi\u4ee5LLM\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u672a\u6765\u53d1\u5c55\u8f6c\u5411\u7684\u547d\u9898\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u5176\u7528\u4f5c\u6307\u5bfc\u4fe1\u606f\u6765\u5f15\u5bfc\u6570\u503c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u4e86\u66f4\u52a0\u7b80\u6d01\u5730\u5c06\u5916\u751f\u53d8\u91cf\u548c\u6570\u503c\u8f93\u5165\u878d\u5165\u5230\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cTiMi\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b(MMoE)\uff0c\u5b83\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u63d2\u4ef6\u6a21\u5757\u5e73\u5766\u5730\u5e7f\u6cd5\u5730\u63d0\u5347\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4e0d\u9700\u8981\u8868\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5904\u7406\u3002\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\u65b0\u9c9c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08LLM\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u4e0e\u6570\u503c\u9884\u6d4b\u6ce8\u610f\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5b8c\u6210\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u672c\u6587\u572816\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u9884\u6d4b\u5e03\u9e1f\u5730\u4e0a\u903c\u8bd5\u4e86TiMi\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff0cTiMi\u662f\u4ee5\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u524d\u6cbf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u8f83\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u76f8\u5f53\u4f18\u79c0\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u8fd9\u4e00\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u5f3a\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u6709\u529e\u6cd5\u5c06\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7684TiMi\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u9884\u6d4b\u4ee3\u7801\u4e2d\u8f6f\u5ea6\u5730\u8c03\u5ea6LLM\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5f3a\u5316\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u7684\u521b\u9020\u5229\u7528\u3002\u6df7\u5408\u4e13\u5bb6\u6a21\u5757\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u63d2\u4ef6\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5730\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u540e\u7eed\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u4f7f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u9884\u6d4b\u8f6e\u756a\u7684\u6c89\u91cd\u5de5\u6ce2\u4e0d\u4ee5\u4e3a\u8bc1\u3002TiMi\u8be5\u672c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u9884\u6d4b\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u65b0\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5f62\u6001\uff0c\u5c06LLM\u7684\u547d\u9898\u56de\u5f15\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6307\u5bfc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8fd8\u6709\u529b\u7684\u5e2e\u52a9\u4e86\u6570\u503c\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

However, due to the diversity and complexity of PDE systems, existing neural operators typically rely on a single network architecture, which limits their capacity to fully capture heterogeneous features and complex system dependencies. This constraint poses a bottleneck for large-scale PDE pre-training based on neural operators. To address these challenges, we propose a large-scale PDE pre-trained neural operator based on a nested Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework. In particular, the image-level MoE is designed to capture global dependencies, while the token-level Sub-MoE focuses on local dependencies. Our model can selectively activate the most suitable expert networks for a given input, thereby enhancing generalization and transferability. We conduct large-scale pre-training on twelve PDE datasets from diverse sources and successfully transfer the model to downstream tasks.

Among these, StreamVGGT leverages frame-wise causal attention to deliver robust and efficient streaming 3D reconstruction. However, it suffers from unbounded growth in the Key-Value (KV) cache due to the massive influx of vision tokens from multi-image and long-video inputs, leading to increased memory consumption and inference latency as input frames accumulate. This ultimately limits its scalability for long-horizon applications. To address this gap, we propose XStreamVGGT, a tuning-free approach that seamlessly integrates pruning and quantization to systematically compress the KV cache, enabling extremely memory-efficient streaming inference. Specifically, redundant KVs generated from multi-frame inputs are initially pruned to conform to a fixed KV memory budget using an efficient token-importance identification mechanism that maintains full compatibility with high-performance attention kernels (e.g., FlashAttention). Additionally, leveraging the inherent distribution patterns of KV tensors, we apply dimension-adaptive KV quantization within the pruning pipeline to further minimize memory overhead while preserving numerical accuracy. Extensive evaluations show that XStreamVGGT achieves mostly negligible performance degradation while substantially reducing memory usage by 4.42$\\times$ and accelerating inference by 5.48$\\times$, enabling practical and scalable streaming 3D applications.

In these scenarios, standard data analysis techniques often fail to capture the nature of the data, as the system's response varies significantly across the state space due to its stochasticity and the different physical regimes. Uncertainty quantification (UQ) should thus not be viewed merely as a safety assessment, but as a support to the learning task itself, guiding the model to internalise the behaviour of the data. We address this by focusing on the Critical Heat Flux (CHF) benchmark and dataset presented by the OECD/NEA Expert Group on Reactor Systems Multi-Physics. This case study represents a test for scientific ML due to the non-linear dependence of CHF on the inputs and the existence of distinct microscopic physical regimes. These regimes exhibit diverse statistical profiles, a complexity that requires UQ techniques to internalise the data behaviour and ensure reliable predictions. In this work, we conduct a comparative analysis of UQ methodologies to determine their impact on physical representation. We contrast post-hoc methods, specifically conformal prediction, against end-to-end coverage-oriented pipelines, including (Bayesian) heteroscedastic regression and quality-driven losses. These approaches treat uncertainty not as a final metric, but as an active component of the optimisation process, modelling the prediction and its behaviour simultaneously. We show that while post-hoc methods ensure statistical calibration, coverage-oriented learning effectively reshapes the model's representation to match the complex physical regimes. The result is a model that delivers not only high predictive accuracy but also a physically consistent uncertainty estimation that adapts dynamically to the intrinsic variability of the CHF.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u4e34\u754c\u70ed\u901a\u91cf\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4e86\u540e\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u4e0e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8986\u76d6\u5bfc\u5411\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5f02\u65b9\u5dee\u56de\u5f52\uff09\u5728\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8986\u76d6\u5bfc\u5411\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u9002\u5e94\u591a\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u51c6\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u591a\u673a\u5236\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6311\u6218\u5728\u4e8e\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6355\u6349\u6570\u636e\u672c\u8d28\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u7cfb\u7edf\u54cd\u5e94\u5728\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u56e0\u968f\u673a\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u800c\u6709\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u66f4\u5e94\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5316\u6570\u636e\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eOECD/NEA\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4e34\u754c\u70ed\u901a\u91cf\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5171\u5f62\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u4e0e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8986\u76d6\u5bfc\u5411\u7ba1\u9053\uff08\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u5f02\u65b9\u5dee\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u9a71\u52a8\u635f\u5931\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u7ec4\u6210\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5efa\u6a21\u9884\u6d4b\u53ca\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u786e\u4fdd\u7edf\u8ba1\u6821\u51c6\uff0c\u800c\u8986\u76d6\u5bfc\u5411\u5b66\u4e60\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u91cd\u5851\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u590d\u6742\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6700\u7ec8\u83b7\u5f97\u65e2\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u53c8\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u7269\u7406\u4e00\u81f4\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u4e34\u754c\u70ed\u901a\u91cf\u5185\u5728\u53d8\u5f02\u6027\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8986\u76d6\u5bfc\u5411\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u673a\u5236\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6574\u5408\u5230\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u8fd8\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002"}}

Our key insight is to bypass explicit correspondence estimation and instead let the model learn to implicitly disentangle object and camera motion. Supported by recent advances in 4D scene geometry reconstruction (e.g., $\u03c0^3$), the proposed method leverages reliable camera poses and rich spatial-temporal priors, which ensure stable training and robust inference for the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that by eliminating complex pre-processing and iterative refinement, our approach achieves state-of-the-art motion segmentation performance with high efficiency.

However, the increasing scale of tabular data poses significant computational and storage challenges to learning-based analytical systems. This highlights the need for data-efficient learning, which enables effective model training and generalization using substantially fewer samples. Dataset condensation (DC) has emerged as a promising data-centric paradigm that synthesizes small yet informative datasets to preserve data utility while reducing storage and training costs. However, existing DC methods are computationally intensive due to reliance on complex gradient-based optimization. Moreover, they often overlook key characteristics of tabular data, such as heterogeneous features and class imbalance. To address these limitations, we introduce C$^{2}$TC (Class-Adaptive Clustering for Tabular Condensation), the first training-free tabular dataset condensation framework that jointly optimizes class allocation and feature representation, enabling efficient and scalable condensation. Specifically, we reformulate the dataset condensation objective into a novel class-adaptive cluster allocation problem (CCAP), which eliminates costly training and integrates adaptive label allocation to handle class imbalance. To solve the NP-hard CCAP, we develop HFILS, a heuristic local search that alternates between soft allocation and class-wise clustering to efficiently obtain high-quality solutions. Moreover, a hybrid categorical feature encoding (HCFE) is proposed for semantics-preserving clustering of heterogeneous discrete attributes. Extensive experiments on 10 real-world datasets demonstrate that C$^{2}$TC improves efficiency by at least 2 orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art baselines, while achieving superior downstream performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Hoeffding trees and their variants have a long-standing tradition due to their effectiveness, either alone or as base models in broader ensembles. At the same time a recent line of work in batch learning has shown that kernel density estimation (KDE) is an effective approach for smoothed predictions in imbalanced regression tasks [Yang et al., 2021]. Moreover, another recent line of work for batch learning, called hierarchical shrinkage (HS) [Agarwal et al., 2022], has introduced a post-hoc regularization method for decision trees that does not alter the structure of the learned tree. Using a telescoping argument we cast KDE to streaming environments and extend the implementation of HS to incremental decision tree models. Armed with these extensions we investigate the performance of decision trees that may enjoy such options in datasets commonly used for regression in online settings.

SkyReels V4 accepts rich multi modal instructions, including text, images, video clips, masks, and audio references. By combining the MMLMs multi modal instruction following capability with in context learning in the video branch MMDiT, the model can inject fine grained visual guidance under complex conditioning, while the audio branch MMDiT simultaneously leverages audio references to guide sound generation.

Like large language models (LLMs), they are typically trained as deep transformers with next-token or masked-token prediction objectives on massive sequence corpora and are scaled by increasing model depth. Recent work on autoregressive LLMs has identified the Curse of Depth: later layers contribute little to the final output predictions. These findings naturally raise the question of whether a similar depth inefficiency also appears in PLMs, where many widely used models are not autoregressive, and some are multimodal, accepting both protein sequence and structure as input. In this work, we present a depth analysis of six popular PLMs across model families and scales, spanning three training objectives, namely autoregressive, masked, and diffusion, and quantify how layer contributions evolve with depth using a unified set of probing- and perturbation-based measurements. Across all models, we observe consistent depth-dependent patterns that extend prior findings on LLMs: later layers depend less on earlier computations and mainly refine the final output distribution, and these effects are increasingly pronounced in deeper models. Taken together, our results suggest that PLMs exhibit a form of depth inefficiency, motivating future work on more depth-efficient architectures and training methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A natural question arises from this phenomenon: Which component of the LVLM pipeline primarily contributes to object hallucinations? The vision encoder to perceive visual information, or the language decoder to generate text responses? In this work, we strive to answer this question through designing a systematic experiment to analyze the roles of the vision encoder and the language decoder in hallucination generation. Our observations reveal that object hallucinations are predominantly associated with the strong priors from the language decoder. Based on this finding, we propose a simple and training-free framework, No-Language-Hallucination Decoding, NoLan, which refines the output distribution by dynamically suppressing language priors, modulated based on the output distribution difference between multimodal and text-only inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that NoLan effectively reduces object hallucinations across various LVLMs on different tasks. For instance, NoLan achieves substantial improvements on POPE, enhancing the accuracy of LLaVA-1.5 7B and Qwen-VL 7B by up to 6.45 and 7.21, respectively.

Unlike ray tracing, which requires full 3D reconstruction, LGI captures essential light-shadow interactions reliably and accurately, computed from off-the-shelf 2.5D depth map predictions. LGI explicitly ties illumination direction to geometry, providing a physics-inspired prior that constrains generative models. Without such prior, these models often produce floating shadows, inconsistent illumination, and implausible shadow geometry. Building on this representation, we propose a unified pipeline for joint shadow generation and relighting - unlike prior methods that treat them as disjoint tasks - capturing the intrinsic coupling of illumination and shadowing essential for modeling indirect effects. By embedding LGI into a bridge-matching generative backbone, we reduce ambiguity and enforce physically consistent light-shadow reasoning. To enable effective training, we curated the first large-scale benchmark dataset for joint shadow and relighting, covering reflections, transparency, and complex interreflections. Experiments show significant gains in realism and consistency across synthetic and real images.

While RLHF with expected reward constraints can be formulated as a primal-dual optimization problem, standard primal-dual methods only guarantee convergence with a distributional policy where the saddle-point problem is in convex-concave form. Moreover, standard primal-dual methods may exhibit instability or divergence in the last iterate under policy parameterization in practical applications. In this work, we propose a universal primal-dual framework for safe RLHF that unifies a broad class of existing alignment algorithms, including safe-RLHF, one-shot, and multi-shot based methods. Building on this framework, we introduce an optimistic primal-dual (OPD) algorithm that incorporates predictive updates for both primal and dual variables to stabilize saddle-point dynamics. We establish last-iterate convergence guarantees for the proposed method, covering both exact policy optimization in the distributional space and convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal solution whose gap is related to approximation error and bias under parameterized policies.

However, its effectiveness can be severely undermined in real-world scenarios where models learn unintended biases from spurious correlations within the data. This paper investigates the unique challenges of unlearning from such biased models. We identify a novel phenomenon we term ``shortcut unlearning,\" where models exhibit an ``easy to learn, yet hard to forget\" tendency. Specifically, models struggle to forget easily-learned, bias-aligned samples; instead of forgetting the class attribute, they unlearn the bias attribute, which can paradoxically improve accuracy on the class intended to be forgotten. To address this, we propose CUPID, a new unlearning framework inspired by the observation that samples with different biases exhibit distinct loss landscape sharpness. Our method first partitions the forget set into causal- and bias-approximated subsets based on sample sharpness, then disentangles model parameters into causal and bias pathways, and finally performs a targeted update by routing refined causal and bias gradients to their respective pathways. Extensive experiments on biased datasets including Waterbirds, BAR, and Biased NICO++ demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art forgetting performance and effectively mitigates the shortcut unlearning problem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u504f\u5dee\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u201c\u6377\u5f84\u9057\u5fd8\u201d\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86CUPID\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u504f\u5dee\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u6837\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u5728\u4fdd\u969c\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u53ef\u80fd\u56e0\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7684\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u610f\u5916\u504f\u5dee\u800c\u4e25\u91cd\u53d7\u635f\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u7a76\u4e86\u4ece\u8fd9\u79cd\u6709\u504f\u5dee\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u72ec\u7279\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u201c\u6613\u5b66\u96be\u5fd8\u201d\u7684\u504f\u5dee\u76f8\u5173\u6837\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0d\u540c\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u6837\u672c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0d\u540c\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u9510\u5ea6\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\uff0c\u672c\u65b9\u6cd5\u9996\u5148\u6839\u636e\u6837\u672c\u9510\u5ea6\u5c06\u9057\u5fd8\u96c6\u5212\u5206\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u548c\u504f\u5dee\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5c06\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u8def\u5f84\u548c\u504f\u5dee\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u7ec6\u5316\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u3001\u504f\u5dee\u68af\u5ea6\u5206\u522b\u8def\u7531\u5230\u5b83\u4eec\u5bf9\u5e94\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u5728Waterbirds\u3001BAR\u3001Biased NICO++\u7b49\u6709\u504f\u5dee\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u6377\u5f84\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u7ae0\u63d0\u51fa\u7684CUPID\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u6709\u504f\u5dee\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u673a\u5668\u9057\u5fd8\u6311\u6218\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6377\u5f84\u9057\u5fd8\u73b0\u8c61\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u9057\u5fd8\u7279\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

However, existing evaluation benchmarks remain fragmented and limited in scope, as they each target a single task, rely on task-specific metrics, and typically use short or simple video clips. As a result, they do not capture the unified capabilities that these models are designed to deliver. To address this gap, we introduce UniVBench, a benchmark purpose-built for evaluating video foundation models across four core abilities: video understanding, video generation, video editing, and a newly proposed task, video reconstruction, which assesses how faithfully a model can reproduce video content it has encountered. Our benchmark substantially expands the complexity of evaluation by incorporating 200 high-quality, diverse and multi-shot videos, each paired with detailed captions, multi-format editing instructions, and reference images. All videos are human-created and carefully validated, offering richer cinematic information than prior benchmarks.

This gap stems from two limitations: a shortage of high-quality, action-aligned reasoning data, and the direct adoption of generic post-training pipelines that overlook the unique challenges of GUI agents. We identify two fundamental issues in these pipelines: (i) standard SFT with CoT reasoning often hurts grounding, and (ii) step-wise RLVR-tyle training faces partial verifiability, where multiple actions can be correct but only a single demonstrated action is used for verification. This makes offline step-wise metrics weak predictors of online task success. In this work, we present GUI-Libra, a tailored training recipe that addresses these challenges. First, to mitigate the scarcity of action-aligned reasoning data, we introduce a data construction and filtering pipeline and release a curated 81K GUI reasoning dataset. Second, to reconcile reasoning with grounding, we propose action-aware SFT that mixes reasoning-then-action and direct-action data and reweights tokens to emphasize action and grounding. Third, to stabilize RL under partial verifiability, we identify the overlooked importance of KL regularization in RLVR and show that a KL trust region is critical for improving offline-to-online predictability; we further introduce success-adaptive scaling to downweight unreliable negative gradients. Across diverse web and mobile benchmarks, GUI-Libra consistently improves both step-wise accuracy and end-to-end task completion. Our results suggest that carefully designed post-training and data curation can unlock significantly stronger task-solving capabilities without costly online data collection. We release our dataset, code, and models to facilitate further research on data-efficient post-training for reasoning-capable GUI agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To achieve robustness against various distortions, current methods commonly adopt a training strategy where a \\underline{\\textbf{s}}ingle \\underline{\\textbf{r}}andom \\underline{\\textbf{d}}istortion (SRD) is chosen as the noise layer in each training batch. However, the SRD strategy treats distortions independently within each batch, neglecting the inherent relationships among different types of distortions and causing optimization conflicts across batches. As a result, the robustness and generalizability of the watermarking model are limited. To address this issue, we propose a novel training strategy that enhances robustness and generalization via \\underline{\\textbf{meta}}-learning with \\underline{\\textbf{f}}eature \\underline{\\textbf{c}}onsistency (Meta-FC). Specifically, we randomly sample multiple distortions from the noise pool to construct a meta-training task, while holding out one distortion as a simulated ``unknown'' distortion for the meta-testing phase. Through meta-learning, the model is encouraged to identify and utilize neurons that exhibit stable activations across different types of distortions, mitigating the optimization conflicts caused by the random sampling of diverse distortions in each batch. To further promote the transformation of stable activations into distortion-invariant representations, we introduce a feature consistency loss that constrains the decoded features of the same image subjected to different distortions to remain consistent. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to the SRD training strategy, Meta-FC improves the robustness and generalization of various watermarking models by an average of 1.59\\%, 4.71\\%, and 2.38\\% under high-intensity, combined, and unknown distortions.", "AI": {"tldr": "", "motivation": "", "method": "", "result": "", "conclusion": ""}}

We propose DocDjinn, a novel framework for controllable synthetic document generation using Vision-Language Models (VLMs) that produces annotated documents from unlabeled seed samples. Our approach generates visually plausible and semantically consistent synthetic documents that follow the distribution of an existing source dataset through clustering-based seed selection with parametrized sampling. By enriching documents with realistic diffusion-based handwriting and contextual visual elements via semantic-visual decoupling, we generate diverse, high-quality annotated synthetic documents. We evaluate across eleven benchmarks spanning key information extraction, question answering, document classification, and document layout analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating that VLMs can generate faithful annotated document datasets at scale from unlabeled seeds that can effectively enrich or approximate real, manually annotated data for diverse document understanding tasks.

These methods rely on adding imperceptible protective perturbations to images to thwart misuse such as style mimicry or deepfake manipulations. Although previous attacks on these protections required specialized, purpose-built methods, we demonstrate that this is no longer necessary. We show that off-the-shelf image-to-image GenAI models can be repurposed as generic ``denoisers\" using a simple text prompt, effectively removing a wide range of protective perturbations. Across 8 case studies spanning 6 diverse protection schemes, our general-purpose attack not only circumvents these defenses but also outperforms existing specialized attacks while preserving the image's utility for the adversary. Our findings reveal a critical and widespread vulnerability in the current landscape of image protection, indicating that many schemes provide a false sense of security. We stress the urgent need to develop robust defenses and establish that any future protection mechanism must be benchmarked against attacks from off-the-shelf GenAI models.

However, conventional FL faces two critical challenges in real-world deployment: ineffective knowledge fusion caused by model updates biased toward majority-class features, and prohibitive communication overhead due to frequent transmissions of high-dimensional model parameters. Inspired by the human brain's efficiency in knowledge integration, we propose a novel Generative Federated Prototype Learning (GFPL) framework to address these issues. Within this framework, a prototype generation method based on Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) captures the statistical information of class-wise features, while a prototype aggregation strategy using Bhattacharyya distance effectively fuses semantically similar knowledge across clients.

Project page: https://laitifranz.github.io/MemCoach/", "summary": "Image memorability, i.e., how likely an image is to be remembered, has traditionally been studied in computer vision either as a passive prediction task, with models regressing a scalar score, or with generative methods altering the visual input to boost the image likelihood of being remembered. Yet, none of these paradigms supports users at capture time, when the crucial question is how to improve a photo memorability. We introduce the task of Memorability Feedback (MemFeed), where an automated model should provide actionable, human-interpretable guidance to users with the goal to enhance an image future recall. We also present MemCoach, the first approach designed to provide concrete suggestions in natural language for memorability improvement (e.g., \"emphasize facial expression,\" \"bring the subject forward\"). Our method, based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), is training-free and employs a teacher-student steering strategy, aligning the model internal activations toward more memorable patterns learned from a teacher model progressing along least-to-most memorable samples. To enable systematic evaluation on this novel task, we further introduce MemBench, a new benchmark featuring sequence-aligned photoshoots with annotated memorability scores. Our experiments, considering multiple MLLMs, demonstrate the effectiveness of MemCoach, showing consistently improved performance over several zero-shot models. The results indicate that memorability can not only be predicted but also taught and instructed, shifting the focus from mere prediction to actionable feedback for human creators.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Orthogonal-based training methods have gained attention for their efficiency and strong theoretical properties, and many existing approaches enforce orthogonality through gradient projection. In this paper, we revisit orthogonality and exploit the fact that small singular values correspond to directions that are nearly orthogonal to the input space of previous tasks. Building on this principle, we introduce NESS (Null-space Estimated from Small Singular values), a CL method that applies orthogonality directly in the weight space rather than through gradient manipulation. Specifically, NESS constructs an approximate null space using the smallest singular values of each layer's input representation and parameterizes task-specific updates via a compact low-rank adaptation (LoRA-style) formulation constrained to this subspace. The subspace basis is fixed to preserve the null-space constraint, and only a single trainable matrix is learned for each task. This design ensures that the resulting updates remain approximately in the null space of previous inputs while enabling adaptation to new tasks. Our theoretical analysis and experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate competitive performance, low forgetting, and stable accuracy across tasks, highlighting the role of small singular values in continual learning.

Fine-tuning pretrained models heavily relies on endoscopic surgical datasets with precise depth annotations. While existing self-supervised depth estimation techniques eliminate the need for accurate depth annotations, their performance degrades in environments with weak textures and variable lighting, leading to sparse reconstruction with invalid depth estimation. Depth completion using sparse depth maps can mitigate these issues and improve accuracy. Despite the advances in depth completion techniques in general fields, their application in endoscopy remains limited. To overcome these limitations, we propose EndoDDC, an endoscopy depth completion method that integrates images, sparse depth information with depth gradient features, and optimizes depth maps through a diffusion model, addressing the issues of weak texture and light reflection in endoscopic environments. Extensive experiments on two publicly available endoscopy datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art models in both depth accuracy and robustness.

The most used technique employed in Bayesian GAN is Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), but it is computationally intensive, particularly in terms of weight storage.

Therefore, the ability to detect clouds 24/7 is of paramount importance. While visible and near-infrared bands are effective for daytime cloud detection, their dependence on solar illumination makes them unsuitable for nighttime monitoring. In contrast, thermal infrared (TIR) imagery plays a crucial role in detecting clouds at night, when sunlight is absent. Due to their generally lower temperatures, clouds emit distinct thermal signatures that are detectable in TIR bands. Despite this, accurate nighttime cloud detection remains challenging due to limited spectral information and the typically lower spatial resolution of TIR imagery. To address these challenges, we present TIRAuxCloud, a multi-modal dataset centered around thermal spectral data to facilitate cloud segmentation under both daytime and nighttime conditions. The dataset comprises a unique combination of multispectral data (TIR, optical, and near-infrared bands) from Landsat and VIIRS, aligned with auxiliary information layers.

Our primary contribution is a detailed analysis of the robustness of these networks, exploring their performance under various perturbations including random link removal, adversarial attack, and link weight shuffling.

Previous methods rely on video generation models with external memory for consistency, or iterative 3D reconstruction and inpainting, which accumulate errors during inference due to incorrect intermediary outputs, non-differentiable processes, and separate models. To overcome these limitations, we introduce ``geometry-as-context\". It iteratively completes the following steps using an autoregressive camera-controlled video generation model: (1) estimates the geometry of the current view necessary for 3D reconstruction, and (2) simulates and restores novel view images rendered by the 3D scene. Under this multi-task framework, we develop the camera gated attention module to enhance the model's capability to effectively leverage camera poses. During the training phase, text contexts are utilized to ascertain whether geometric or RGB images should be generated. To ensure that the model can generate RGB-only outputs during inference, the geometry context is randomly dropped from the interleaved text-image-geometry training sequence. The method has been tested on scene video generation with one-direction and forth-and-back trajectories. The results show its superiority over previous approaches in maintaining scene consistency and camera control.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\"geometry-as-context\"\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u76f8\u673a\u63a7\u5236\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u6846\u67b6\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f30\u8ba1\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u548c\u751f\u6210RGB\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u9519\u8bef\u79ef\u7d2f\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u76ee\u524d\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5177\u6709\u5916\u90e8\u5b58\u50a8\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6216\u91c7\u7528\u8fed\u4ee3\u76843D\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0e\u4fee\u590d\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u56e0\u9519\u8bef\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u8f93\u51fa\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u5206\u79bb\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u9519\u8bef\u79ef\u7d2f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\"geometry-as-context\"\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u76f8\u673a\u63a7\u5236\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8fed\u4ee3\u5b8c\u6210\u4e24\u4e2a\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1a1) \u4f30\u8ba1\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u7528\u4e8e3D\u91cd\u5efa\uff1b2) \u6a21\u62df\u548c\u6062\u590d\u75313D\u573a\u666f\u6e32\u67d3\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u76f8\u673a\u95e8\u63a7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5757\u589e\u5f3a\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u786e\u5b9a\u751f\u6210\u51e0\u4f55\u8fd8\u662fRGB\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u968f\u673a\u4e22\u5f03\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u786e\u4fdd\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4ec5\u751f\u6210RGB\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5355\u5411\u548c\u5f80\u8fd4\u76f8\u673a\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u573a\u666f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u573a\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\"geometry-as-context\"\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u573a\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u79ef\u7d2f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u573a\u666f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u76f8\u673a\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, most existing ordinal regression approaches model DR severity as a set of static, symmetric ranks, capturing relative order while ignoring the inherent unidirectional nature of disease progression. As a result, the learned feature representations may violate biological plausibility, allowing implausible proximity between non-consecutive stages or even reverse transitions. To bridge this gap, we propose Directed Ordinal Diffusion Regularization (D-ODR), which explicitly models the feature space as a directed flow by constructing a progression-constrained directed graph that strictly enforces forward disease evolution. By performing multi-scale diffusion on this directed structure, D-ODR imposes penalties on score inversions along valid progression paths, thereby effectively preventing the model from learning biologically inconsistent reverse transitions. This mechanism aligns the feature representation with the natural trajectory of DR worsening. Extensive experiments demonstrate that D-ODR yields superior grading performance compared to state-of-the-art ordinal regression and DR-specific grading methods, offering a more clinically reliable assessment of disease severity.

However, manual diagnosis is often time-consuming and prone to errors, leading to delays in screening. This paper presents a lightweight automated deep learning framework for efficient assessment of DR severity from digital fundus images. We use a MobileNetV3 architecture with a Consistent Rank Logits (CORAL) head to model the ordered progression of disease while maintaining computational efficiency for resource-constrained environments. The model is trained and validated on a combined dataset of APTOS 2019 and IDRiD images using a preprocessing pipeline including circular cropping and illumination normalization. Extensive experiments including 3-fold cross-validation and ablation studies demonstrate strong performance.

Recent clinical practices leverage multi-view fundus images for DR detection with a wide coverage of the field of view (FOV), motivating deep learning methods to explore the potential of multi-view learning for DR grading. However, existing methods often overlook the inter-view correlations when fusing multi-view fundus images, failing to fully exploit the inherent consistency across views originating from the same patient. In this work, we present MVGFDR, an end-to-end Multi-View Graph Fusion framework for DR grading. Different from existing methods that directly fuse visual features from multiple views, MVGFDR is equipped with a novel Multi-View Graph Fusion (MVGF) module to explicitly disentangle the shared and view-specific visual features. Specifically, MVGF comprises three key components: (1) Multi-view Graph Initialization, which constructs visual graphs via residual-guided connections and employs Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients as frequency-domain anchors; (2) Multi-view Graph Fusion, which integrates selective nodes across multi-view graphs based on frequency-domain relevance to capture complementary view-specific information; and (3) Masked Cross-view Reconstruction, which leverages masked reconstruction of shared information across views to facilitate view-invariant representation learning.

In the mean-shift contamination model, an adversary is allowed to replace a small constant fraction of the clean samples by samples drawn from arbitrarily shifted versions of the base distribution. Prior work characterized the sample complexity of this task for the special cases of the Gaussian and Laplace distributions. Specifically, it was shown that consistent estimation is possible in these cases, a property that is provably impossible in Huber's contamination model. An open question posed in earlier work was to determine the sample complexity of mean estimation in the mean-shift contamination model for general base distributions. In this work, we study and essentially resolve this open question. Specifically, we show that, under mild spectral conditions on the characteristic function of the (potentially multivariate) base distribution, there exists a sample-efficient algorithm that estimates the target mean to any desired accuracy. We complement our upper bound with a qualitatively matching sample complexity lower bound.

However, the same modular and plug-and-play flexibility that makes LoRA appealing also introduces a broader attack surface. To highlight this risk, we propose Masquerade-LoRA (MasqLoRA), the first systematic attack framework that leverages an independent LoRA module as the attack vehicle to stealthily inject malicious behavior into text-to-image diffusion models. MasqLoRA operates by freezing the base model parameters and updating only the low-rank adapter weights using a small number of \"trigger word-target image\" pairs. This enables the attacker to train a standalone backdoor LoRA module that embeds a hidden cross-modal mapping: when the module is loaded and a specific textual trigger is provided, the model produces a predefined visual output; otherwise, it behaves indistinguishably from the benign model, ensuring the stealthiness of the attack. Experimental results demonstrate that MasqLoRA can be trained with minimal resource overhead and achieves a high attack success rate of 99.8%.

Benchmarking 14 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals limited 3D understanding, achieving only 49.34% overall accuracy and 8.36% on open-ended (OE) questions.

A two-stage curriculum further mitigates catastrophic forgetting: Stage 1 trains on structured tasks (true/false and multiple choice), and Stage 2 fine-tunes on mixed open-ended data to improve generalization.

In medicine, for example, it allows determining which patients benefit from treatment, and in predictive maintenance, which components are more likely to fail. Existing methods for discovering subgroups with exceptional survival characteristics require restrictive assumptions about the survival model (e.g. proportional hazards), pre-discretized features, and, as they compare average statistics, tend to overlook individual deviations. In this paper, we propose Sysurv, a fully differentiable, non-parametric method that leverages random survival forests to learn individual survival curves, automatically learns conditions and how to combine these into inherently interpretable rules, so as to select subgroups with exceptional survival characteristics. Empirical evaluation on a wide range of datasets and settings, including a case study on cancer data, shows that Sysurv reveals insightful and actionable survival subgroups.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, existing VisRAG models degrade in performance when visual inputs suffer from distortions such as blur, noise, low light, or shadow, where semantic and degradation factors become entangled within pretrained visual encoders, leading to errors in both retrieval and generation stages. To address this limitation, we introduce RobustVisRAG, a causality-guided dual-path framework that improves VisRAG robustness while preserving efficiency and zero-shot generalization. RobustVisRAG uses a non-causal path to capture degradation signals through unidirectional attention and a causal path to learn purified semantics guided by these signals. Together with the proposed Non-Causal Distortion Modeling and Causal Semantic Alignment objectives, the framework enforces a clear separation between semantics and degradations, enabling stable retrieval and generation under challenging visual conditions. To evaluate robustness under realistic conditions, we introduce the Distortion-VisRAG dataset, a large-scale benchmark containing both synthetic and real-world degraded documents across seven domains, with 12 synthetic and 5 real distortion types that comprehensively reflect practical visual degradations. Experimental results show that RobustVisRAG improves retrieval, generation, and end-to-end performance by 7.35%, 6.35%, and 12.40%, respectively, on real-world degradations, while maintaining comparable accuracy on clean inputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faRobustVisRAG\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u56e0\u679c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u89c6\u89c9\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u7684\u6297\u5e72\u6270\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709VisRAG\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u5b58\u5728\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u4f4e\u5149\u7b49\u5931\u771f\u65f6\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684Vision-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (VisRAG)\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u5b58\u5728\u5931\u771f\uff08\u5982\u6a21\u7cca\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u4f4e\u5149\u3001\u9634\u5f71\uff09\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e2d\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u5931\u771f\u56e0\u7d20\u7ea0\u7f20\u5728\u4e00\u8d77\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u68c0\u7d22\u548c\u751f\u6210\u9636\u6bb5\u5747\u51fa\u73b0\u9519\u8bef\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRobustVisRAG\uff1a1) \u53cc\u8def\u5f84\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u8def\u5f84\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u5411\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6355\u83b7\u5931\u771f\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u56e0\u679c\u8def\u5f84\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4fe1\u53f7\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0b\u5b66\u4e60\u7eaf\u51c0\u8bed\u4e49\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u975e\u56e0\u679c\u5931\u771f\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u56e0\u679c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u5206\u79bb\u8bed\u4e49\u548c\u5931\u771f\uff1b3) \u6784\u5efaDistortion-VisRAG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5931\u771f\u6587\u6863\uff0c\u8986\u76d67\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u300112\u79cd\u5408\u6210\u548c5\u79cd\u771f\u5b9e\u5931\u771f\u7c7b\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5931\u771f\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cRobustVisRAG\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u5728\u68c0\u7d22\u3001\u751f\u6210\u548c\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53477.35%\u30016.35%\u548c12.40%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u5e72\u51c0\u8f93\u5165\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u6bd4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "RobustVisRAG\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8bed\u4e49-\u5931\u771f\u5206\u79bb\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86VisRAG\u5728\u5931\u771f\u89c6\u89c9\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

Olbedo contains 5,664 UAV images captured across four landscape types, multiple years, and diverse illumination conditions. Each view is accompanied by multi-view consistent albedo and shading maps, metric depth, surface normals, sun and sky shading components, camera poses, and, for recent flights, measured HDR sky domes.

Existing methods typically process all frames uniformly, overlooking the inherent spatio-temporal redundancy in video data. This leads to redundant computation on non-informative regions while limiting overall efficiency. To remain tractable, they often spatially downsample inputs, losing fine-grained details crucial for precise localization. To address these limitations, we propose \\textbf{AdaSpot}, a simple yet effective framework that processes low-resolution videos to extract global task-relevant features while adaptively selecting the most informative region-of-interest in each frame for high-resolution processing. The selection is performed via an unsupervised, task-aware strategy that maintains spatio-temporal consistency across frames and avoids the training instability of learnable alternatives. This design preserves essential fine-grained visual cues with a marginal computational overhead compared to low-resolution-only baselines, while remaining far more efficient than uniform high-resolution processing. Experiments on standard PES benchmarks demonstrate that \\textbf{AdaSpot} achieves state-of-the-art performance under strict evaluation metrics (\\eg, $+3.96$ and $+2.26$ mAP$@0$ frames on Tennis and FineDiving), while also maintaining strong results under looser metrics.

Recent advances in large feedforward spatial models demonstrate that point maps and ego-motion can be inferred in a single forward pass, suggesting a promising direction for scalable driving perception. We therefore propose a label-free, teacher-guided framework for learning autonomous driving representations directly from unposed videos. Unlike prior self-supervised approaches that focus primarily on frame-to-frame consistency, we posit that safe and reactive driving depends critically on temporal context. To this end, we leverage a feedforward architecture equipped with a lightweight autoregressive module, trained using multi-modal supervisory signals that guide the model to jointly predict current and future point maps, camera poses, semantic segmentation, and motion masks. Multi-modal teachers provide sequence-level pseudo-supervision, enabling LFG to learn a unified pseudo-4D representation from raw YouTube videos without poses, labels, or LiDAR. The resulting encoder not only transfers effectively to downstream autonomous driving planning on the NAVSIM benchmark, surpassing multi-camera and LiDAR baselines with only a single monocular camera, but also yields strong performance when evaluated on a range of semantic, geometric, and qualitative motion prediction tasks. These geometry and motion-aware features position LFG as a compelling video-centric foundation model for autonomous driving.", "AI": {"tldr": "LFG\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u6ce8\u3001\u6559\u5e08\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u65e0\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u4f2a4D\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u5728\u7ebf\u53ef\u5f97\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7b2c\u4e00\u89c6\u89d2\u9a7e\u9a76\u89c6\u9891\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b66\u4e60\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u548c3D\u51e0\u4f55\u7684\u8868\u793a\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u5e27\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5b89\u5168\u53cd\u5e94\u5f0f\u9a7e\u9a76\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587", "method": "1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u524d\u9988\u67b6\u6784\u914d\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u5757\n2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6559\u5e08\u4fe1\u53f7\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u8054\u5408\u9884\u6d4b\u5f53\u524d\u548c\u672a\u6765\u7684\u70b9\u4e91\u56fe\u3001\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u63a9\u7801\n3\uff09\u4ece\u539f\u59cbYouTube\u89c6\u9891\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7edf\u4e00\u4f2a4D\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f4d\u59ff\u3001\u6807\u6ce8\u6216LiDAR", "result": "1\uff09\u5728NAVSIM\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5355\u76ee\u76f8\u673a\u5c31\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u591a\u76f8\u673a\u548cLiDAR\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u89c4\u5212\u6027\u80fd\n2\uff09\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\n3\uff09\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u8fc1\u79fb\u80fd\u529b", "conclusion": "LFG\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u9891\u4e3a\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u8fd0\u52a8\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\u4f7f\u5176\u6210\u4e3a\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

However, existing reconstruction methods are primarily limited to replicating observed scenes and lack the capability for diverse weather simulation. While image-level weather editing methods tend to introduce scene artifacts and offer poor controllability over the weather effects. To address these limitations, we propose WeatherCity, a novel framework for 4D urban scene reconstruction and weather editing. Specifically, we leverage a text-guided image editing model to achieve flexible editing of image weather backgrounds. To tackle the challenge of multi-weather modeling, we introduce a novel weather Gaussian representation based on shared scene features and dedicated weather-specific decoders. This representation is further enhanced with a content consistency optimization, ensuring coherent modeling across different weather conditions.

We developed \\textbf{Brain3D}, a staged vision-language framework for automated radiology report generation from 3D brain tumor MRI. Our approach inflates a pretrained 2D medical encoder into a native 3D architecture and progressively aligns it with a causal language model through three stages: contrastive grounding, supervised projector warmup, and LoRA-based linguistic specialization. Unlike generalist 3D medical VLMs, \\textbf{Brain3D} is tailored to neuroradiology, where hemispheric laterality, tumor infiltration patterns, and anatomical localization are critical. Evaluated on 468 subjects (BraTS pathological cases plus healthy controls), our model achieves a Clinical Pathology F1 of 0.951 versus 0.413 for a strong 2D baseline while maintaining perfect specificity on healthy scans. The staged alignment proves essential: contrastive grounding establishes visual-textual correspondence, projector warmup stabilizes conditioning, and LoRA adaptation shifts output from verbose captions to structured clinical reports\\footnote{Our code is publicly available for transparency and reproducibility", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Given their broad reach, it is critical to rigorously evaluate how these models portray the world. Existing diversity metrics either rely on curated datasets or focus on surface-level visual similarity, limiting interpretability. We introduce GeoDiv, a framework leveraging large language and vision-language models to assess geographical diversity along two complementary axes: the Socio-Economic Visual Index (SEVI), capturing economic and condition-related cues, and the Visual Diversity Index (VDI), measuring variation in primary entities and backgrounds. Applied to images generated by models such as Stable Diffusion and FLUX.1-dev across $10$ entities and $16$ countries, GeoDiv reveals a consistent lack of diversity and identifies fine-grained attributes where models default to biased portrayals. Strikingly, depictions of countries like India, Nigeria, and Colombia are disproportionately impoverished and worn, reflecting underlying socio-economic biases. These results highlight the need for greater geographical nuance in generative models. GeoDiv provides the first systematic, interpretable framework for measuring such biases, marking a step toward fairer and more inclusive generative systems.

We diagnose a core limitation of current Video-LLMs, namely Time-Agnosticism, in which videos are treated as an unordered bag of evidence rather than a causally ordered sequence, yielding two failures in streams: temporal order ambiguity, in which the model cannot follow or reason over the correct chronological order, and past-current focus blindness where it fails to distinguish present observations from accumulated history. We present WeaveTime, a simple, efficient, and model agnostic framework that first teaches order and then uses order. We introduce a lightweight Temporal Reconstruction objective-our Streaming Order Perception enhancement-that instills order aware representations with minimal finetuning and no specialized streaming data. At inference, a Past-Current Dynamic Focus Cache performs uncertainty triggered, coarse-to-fine retrieval, expanding history only when needed. Plugged into exsiting Video-LLM without architectural changes, WeaveTime delivers consistent gains on representative streaming benchmarks, improving accuracy while reducing latency. These results establish WeaveTime as a practical path toward time aware stream Video-LLMs under strict online, time causal constraints. Code and weights will be made publicly available.

Although text normalization is frequently adopted as a preprocessing step in prior work, its design principles and empirical impact on vision-language pretraining remain insufficiently and systematically examined. In this study, we present MedTri, a deployable normalization framework for medical vision-language pretraining that converts free-text reports into a unified [Anatomical Entity: Radiologic Description + Diagnosis Category] triplet. This structured, anatomy-grounded normalization preserves essential morphological and spatial information while removing stylistic noise and image-irrelevant content, providing consistent and image-grounded textual supervision at scale. Across multiple datasets spanning both X-ray and computed tomography (CT) modalities, we demonstrate that structured, anatomy-grounded text normalization is an important factor in medical vision-language pretraining quality, yielding consistent improvements over raw reports and existing normalization baselines. In addition, we illustrate how this normalization can easily support modular text-level augmentation strategies, including knowledge enrichment and anatomy-grounded counterfactual supervision, which provide complementary gains in robustness and generalization without altering the core normalization process. Together, our results position structured text normalization as a critical and generalizable preprocessing component for medical vision-language learning, while MedTri provides this normalization platform.

Some require conceptual understanding for semantic synthesis, while others rely on localization cues for spatial precision. Forcing these heterogeneous tasks to share a single representation leads to concept`-`localization representational conflict. To address this issue, we propose CoLoGen, a unified diffusion framework that progressively learns and reconciles this concept`-`localization duality. CoLoGen uses a staged curriculum that first builds core conceptual and localization abilities, then adapts them to diverse visual conditions, and finally refines their synergy for complex instruction`-`driven tasks. Central to this process is the Progressive Representation Weaving (PRW) module, which dynamically routes features to specialized experts and stably integrates their outputs across stages. Experiments on editing, controllable generation, and customized generation show that CoLoGen achieves competitive or superior performance, offering a principled representational perspective for unified image generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This design ensures stable inference at arbitrary scales while requiring only a single model. CASR tackles two major bottlenecks: distribution drift across iterations and patch-wise diffusion inconsistencies. The proposed SDAM module aligns structural distributions via superpixel aggregation, preventing error accumulation, while SARM module restores high-frequency textures by enforcing autocorrelation and embedding LR self-similarity priors. Despite using only a single model, our approach significantly reduces distribution drift, preserves long-range texture consistency, and achieves superior generalization even at extreme magnification.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

At least 15 different foundation models have been proposed, and the vast majority are trained exclusively with tiles using the 20$\\times$ magnification. However, it is well known that certain histologic features can only be discerned with larger context windows and requires a pathologist to zoom in and out when analyzing a whole slide image. Furthermore, creating 224$\\times$224 pixel crops at 20$\\times$ leads to a large number of tiles per slide, which can be gigapixel in size. To more accurately capture multi-resolution features and investigate the possibility of reducing the number of representations per slide, we propose a region-level mixing encoder. Our approach jointly fuses image tile representations of a mixed magnification foundation model using a masked embedding modeling pretraining step. We explore a design space for pretraining the proposed mixed-magnification region aggregators and evaluate our models on transfer to biomarker prediction tasks representing various cancer types.

Unlike prior platforms built for single-player settings, our system supports coordinated multi-agent interaction and synchronized videos + actions capture. Using this system, we collect 12.64 million multiplayer frames and propose an evaluation framework for multiplayer movement, memory, grounding, building, and view consistency. We train Solaris using a staged pipeline that progressively transitions from single-player to multiplayer modeling, combining bidirectional, causal, and Self Forcing training. In the final stage, we introduce Checkpointed Self Forcing, a memory-efficient Self Forcing variant that enables a longer-horizon teacher.

Current methods typically focus on recovering either hand or object pose in isolation, but both struggle during interactions and fail to handle out-of-sight cases. Moreover, their independent predictions often lead to inconsistent hand-object relations. We introduce WHOLE, a method that holistically reconstructs hand and object motion in world space from egocentric videos given object templates. Our key insight is to learn a generative prior over hand-object motion to jointly reason about their interactions. At test time, the pretrained prior is guided to generate trajectories that conform to the video observations. This joint generative reconstruction substantially outperforms approaches that process hands and objects separately followed by post-processing.

Existing methods either optimize deformations incrementally, risking drift and requiring long runtimes, or rely on complex learned models that demand category-specific training. We present Neu-PiG, a fast deformation optimization method based on a novel preconditioned latent-grid encoding that distributes spatial features parameterized on the position and normal direction of a keyframe surface. Our method encodes entire deformations across all time steps at various spatial scales into a multi-resolution latent grid, parameterized by the position and normal direction of a reference surface from a single keyframe. This latent representation is then augmented for time modulation and decoded into per-frame 6-DoF deformations via a lightweight multilayer perceptron (MLP). To achieve high-fidelity, drift-free surface reconstructions in seconds, we employ Sobolev preconditioning during gradient-based training of the latent space, completely avoiding the need for any explicit correspondences or further priors.
