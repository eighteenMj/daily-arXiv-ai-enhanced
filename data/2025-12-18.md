Abstract: Change detection for linear infrastructure monitoring requires reliable high-resolution data and regular acquisition cadence. Optical very-high-resolution (VHR) imagery is interpretable and straightforward to label, but clouds break this cadence. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) enables all-weather acquisitions, yet is difficult to annotate. We introduce SkyCap, a bitemporal VHR optical-SAR dataset constructed by archive matching and co-registration of (optical) SkySat and Capella Space (SAR) scenes. We utilize optical-to-SAR label transfer to obtain SAR amplitude change detection (ACD) labels without requiring SAR-expert annotations. We perform continued pretraining of SARATR-X on our SAR data and benchmark the resulting SAR-specific foundation models (FMs) together with SARATR-X against optical FMs on SkyCap under different preprocessing choices. Among evaluated models, MTP(ViT-B+RVSA), an optical FM, with dB+Z-score preprocessing attains the best result (F1$_c$ = 45.06), outperforming SAR-specific FMs further pretrained directly on Capella data. We observe strong sensitivity to preprocessing alignment with pretraining statistics, and the ranking of optical models on optical change detection does not transfer one-to-one to SAR ACD. To our knowledge, this is the first evaluation of foundation models on VHR SAR ACD.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: For robots navigating in human-populated environments, safety and social compliance are equally critical, yet prior work has mostly emphasized safety. Socially compliant navigation that accounts for human comfort, social norms, and contextual appropriateness remains underexplored. Vision language models (VLMs) show promise for this task; however, large-scale models incur substantial computational overhead, leading to higher inference latency and energy consumption, which makes them unsuitable for real-time deployment on resource-constrained robotic platforms. To address this issue, we investigate the effectiveness of small VLM and propose SocialNav-MoE, an efficient Mixture-of-Experts vision language model for socially compliant navigation with reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). We further introduce a semantic similarity reward (SSR) to effectively leverage RFT for enhancing the decision-making capabilities. Additionally, we study the effectiveness of different small language model types (Phi, Qwen, and StableLM), routing strategies, and vision encoders (CLIP vs. SigLIP, frozen vs. fine-tuned). Experiments on the SNEI dataset demonstrate that SocialNav-MoE achieves an excellent balance between navigation accuracy and efficiency. The proposed SSR function is more effective than hard-level and character-level rewards. Source code will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large-scale optical music recognition (OMR) research has focused mainly on Western staff notation, leaving Chinese Jianpu (numbered notation) and its rich lyric resources underexplored. We present a modular expert-system pipeline that converts printed Jianpu scores with lyrics into machine-readable MusicXML and MIDI, without requiring massive annotated training data. Our approach adopts a top-down expert-system design, leveraging traditional computer-vision techniques (e.g., phrase correlation, skeleton analysis) to capitalize on prior knowledge, while integrating unsupervised deep-learning modules for image feature embeddings. This hybrid strategy strikes a balance between interpretability and accuracy. Evaluated on The Anthology of Chinese Folk Songs, our system massively digitizes (i) a melody-only collection of more than 5,000 songs (> 300,000 notes) and (ii) a curated subset with lyrics comprising over 1,400 songs (> 100,000 notes). The system achieves high-precision recognition on both melody (note-wise F1 = 0.951) and aligned lyrics (character-wise F1 = 0.931).

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AquaDiff是一种基于扩散模型的水下图像增强框架，用于校正色差并保持结构保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像因波长选择性吸收和散射而严重退化，导致色偏、对比度低和细节丢失，阻碍视觉应用。

Method: 结合色度先验引导的颜色补偿策略与条件扩散过程，通过交叉注意力融合退化输入和噪声潜在状态；使用残差密集块和多分辨率注意力的增强降噪骨干；提出跨域一致性损失。

Result: 在多个水下基准测试中优于传统、CNN、GAN和扩散方法，实现更优的色偏校正和整体图像质量。

Conclusion: AquaDiff能有效增强水下图像，适用于多样的水下条件。

Abstract: Underwater images are severely degraded by wavelength-dependent light absorption and scattering, resulting in color distortion, low contrast, and loss of fine details that hinder vision-based underwater applications. To address these challenges, we propose AquaDiff, a diffusion-based underwater image enhancement framework designed to correct chromatic distortions while preserving structural and perceptual fidelity. AquaDiff integrates a chromatic prior-guided color compensation strategy with a conditional diffusion process, where cross-attention dynamically fuses degraded inputs and noisy latent states at each denoising step. An enhanced denoising backbone with residual dense blocks and multi-resolution attention captures both global color context and local details. Furthermore, a novel cross-domain consistency loss jointly enforces pixel-level accuracy, perceptual similarity, structural integrity, and frequency-domain fidelity. Extensive experiments on multiple challenging underwater benchmarks demonstrate that AquaDiff provides good results as compared to the state-of-the-art traditional, CNN-, GAN-, and diffusion-based methods, achieving superior color correction and competitive overall image quality across diverse underwater conditions.

TL;DR: DAVR框架通过自我反思和跨模型验证来评估VLM可靠性，在ICCV-CLVL 2025可靠VQA挑战赛中取得领先性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在VQA任务中存在幻觉问题，导致过度自信但错误的答案，严重损害答案可靠性

Method: 提出DAVR框架，采用双路径架构：一条路径利用双选择器模块融合VLM潜在特征和QA嵌入来评估响应可靠性；另一条路径部署外部参考模型进行事实交叉检查以减轻幻觉

Result: 在ICCV-CLVL 2025可靠VQA挑战赛中，DAVR取得领先的Φ₁₀₀分数39.64和100-AUC 97.22，获得第一名

Conclusion: DAVR框架能有效增强VLM响应的可信度，通过综合的不确定性估计解决幻觉问题

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in Visual Question Answering (VQA). However, the susceptibility of VLMs to hallucinations can lead to overconfident yet incorrect answers, severely undermining answer reliability. To address this, we propose Dual-Assessment for VLM Reliability (DAVR), a novel framework that integrates Self-Reflection and Cross-Model Verification for comprehensive uncertainty estimation. The DAVR framework features a dual-pathway architecture: one pathway leverages dual selector modules to assess response reliability by fusing VLM latent features with QA embeddings, while the other deploys external reference models for factual cross-checking to mitigate hallucinations. Evaluated in the Reliable VQA Challenge at ICCV-CLVL 2025, DAVR achieves a leading $Φ_{100}$ score of 39.64 and a 100-AUC of 97.22, securing first place and demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing the trustworthiness of VLM responses.

### [6] [HERBench: A Benchmark for Multi-Evidence Integration in Video Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14870)
*Dan Ben-Ami,Gabriele Serussi,Kobi Cohen,Chaim Baskin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HERBench是一个新的视频问答基准测试，专门评估模型在时间维度上整合多个证据的能力，要求至少融合三个不重叠的视觉线索，揭示当前视频大语言模型在检索和融合多时间证据方面存在明显缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频问答基准测试通常允许问题通过单一显著线索回答，未能充分测试需要整合多个时间分离视觉证据的推理能力。

Method: 构建包含26K个五选一多选题的HERBench基准，分为12个组合任务，引入最小必需帧集(MRFS)指标量化证据需求，评估13个最先进的视频大语言模型。

Result: 评估显示所有模型表现不佳（准确率31-42%，仅略高于20%随机猜测基准），失败原因包括检索缺陷（忽略关键证据）和融合缺陷（即使提供所有必要证据也无法整合信息）。

Conclusion: HERBench通过使跨时间证据不可避免且可量化，为推进稳健、组合式视频理解建立了原则性目标，揭示了当前视频大语言模型在多证据整合方面的核心瓶颈。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) are rapidly improving, yet current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) benchmarks often allow questions to be answered from a single salient cue, under-testing reasoning that must aggregate multiple, temporally separated visual evidence. We present HERBench, a VideoQA benchmark purpose-built to assess multi-evidence integration across time. Each question requires aggregating at least three non-overlapping evidential cues across distinct video segments, so neither language priors nor a single snapshot can suffice. HERBench comprises 26K five-way multiple-choice questions organized into twelve compositional tasks that probe identity binding, cross-entity relations, temporal ordering, co-occurrence verification, and counting. To make evidential demand measurable, we introduce the Minimum Required Frame-Set (MRFS), the smallest number of frames a model must fuse to answer correctly, and show that HERBench imposes substantially higher demand than prior datasets (mean MRFS 5.5 vs. 2.6-4.2). Evaluating 13 state-of-the-art Video-LLMs on HERBench reveals pervasive failures: accuracies of 31-42% are only slightly above the 20% random-guess baseline. We disentangle this failure into two critical bottlenecks: (1) a retrieval deficit, where frame selectors overlook key evidence, and (2) a fusion deficit, where models fail to integrate information even when all necessary evidence is provided. By making cross-time evidence both unavoidable and quantifiable, HERBench establishes a principled target for advancing robust, compositional video understanding.

*Wenshuo Li,Majid Mirmehdi,Tilo Burghardt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 将法医皮肤纹路描述语言引入生态学，构建基于图像与文本协同的生物个体重识别方法，通过生成虚拟个体数据提升跨模态检索精度及可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像自动重识别方法依赖明显形态特征，存在图像单模态的局限性；而野外生物学家长久以来依赖文本描述与视觉结合来识别动物，因此需要融合法医领域成熟的语言化皮肤纹路描述方法来提升重识别的可解释性和跨模态检索能力。

Method: 提出一种视觉-文本协同的重识别方法，使用皮肤纹路文本描述符号来编码动物毛皮拓扑结构；构建含84,264个手动标注细节特征、3,355张图像、185只老虎的数据集；并搭建文本-图像协同合成管道生成虚拟个体数据以增强训练。

Result: 评测表明该跨模态方法能在真实场景中实现文本到视觉的身份恢复，虚拟个体数据合成显著缓解了数据稀缺问题，并提高了跨模态检索的AI准确性。

Conclusion: 皮肤纹路语言引导的生物识别可突破纯视觉方法的局限，通过人类可验证的匹配机制，实现文本到视觉的身份复原，推动了重识别系统的可解释性，并对生态监测中描述模态的语言化统一具有重要进展意义。

Abstract: Biologists have long combined visuals with textual field notes to re-identify (Re-ID) animals. Contemporary AI tools automate this for species with distinctive morphological features but remain largely image-based. Here, we extend Re-ID methodologies by incorporating precise dermatoglyphic textual descriptors-an approach used in forensics but new to ecology. We demonstrate that these specialist semantics abstract and encode animal coat topology using human-interpretable language tags. Drawing on 84,264 manually labelled minutiae across 3,355 images of 185 tigers (Panthera tigris), we evaluate this visual-textual methodology, revealing novel capabilities for cross-modal identity retrieval. To optimise performance, we developed a text-image co-synthesis pipeline to generate 'virtual individuals', each comprising dozens of life-like visuals paired with dermatoglyphic text. Benchmarking against real-world scenarios shows this augmentation significantly boosts AI accuracy in cross-modal retrieval while alleviating data scarcity. We conclude that dermatoglyphic language-guided biometrics can overcome vision-only limitations, enabling textual-to-visual identity recovery underpinned by human-verifiable matchings. This represents a significant advance towards explainability in Re-ID and a language-driven unification of descriptive modalities in ecological monitoring.

Abstract: Creating new visual concepts often requires connecting distinct ideas through their most relevant shared attributes -- their vibe. We introduce Vibe Blending, a novel task for generating coherent and meaningful hybrids that reveals these shared attributes between images. Achieving such blends is challenging for current methods, which struggle to identify and traverse nonlinear paths linking distant concepts in latent space. We propose Vibe Space, a hierarchical graph manifold that learns low-dimensional geodesics in feature spaces like CLIP, enabling smooth and semantically consistent transitions between concepts. To evaluate creative quality, we design a cognitively inspired framework combining human judgments, LLM reasoning, and a geometric path-based difficulty score. We find that Vibe Space produces blends that humans consistently rate as more creative and coherent than current methods.

*Joshua L. Ebbert,Dennis Della Corte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PANDA-PLUS-Bench是一个专门用于评估前列腺癌格里森分级基础模型的基准测试，重点考察模型区分生物信号与载玻片特异伪影的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI基础模型在前列腺癌格里森分级中可能通过学习载玻片特异伪影而非可泛化的生物特征来获得高验证准确度，这限制了其真实临床应用价值，需要专门的方法来量化这种失败模式。

Method: 创建PANDA-PLUS-Bench基准数据集，包含9名不同患者的9张全切片图像，提取512×512和224×224像素的非重叠组织块，应用8种增强条件。使用该基准评估7个基础模型区分生物信号与载玻片水平混杂因素的能力。

Result: 模型间存在显著差异：Virchow2在大规模模型中载玻片水平编码最低（81.0%），但交叉载玻片准确度第二低（47.2%）。专门在前列腺组织上训练的HistoEncoder表现出最高的交叉载玻片准确度（59.7%）和最强的载玻片水平编码（90.3%）。所有模型都显示出可测量的载玻片内与交叉载玻片准确度差距（19.9-26.9个百分点）。

Conclusion: 组织特异性训练可能同时增强生物特征捕获和载玻片特异签名识别。PANDA-PLUS-Bench通过提供专门构建的资源来评估格里森分级这一重要临床场景中的模型鲁棒性，解决了基础模型评估的关键空白。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence foundation models are increasingly deployed for prostate cancer Gleason grading, where GP3/GP4 distinction directly impacts treatment decisions. However, these models may achieve high validation accuracy by learning specimen-specific artifacts rather than generalizable biological features, limiting real-world clinical utility. We introduce PANDA-PLUS-Bench, a curated benchmark dataset derived from expert-annotated prostate biopsies designed specifically to quantify this failure mode. The benchmark comprises nine carefully selected whole slide images from nine unique patients containing diverse Gleason patterns, with non-overlapping tissue patches extracted at both 512x512 and 224x224 pixel resolutions across eight augmentation conditions. Using this benchmark, we evaluate seven foundation models on their ability to separate biological signal from slide-level confounders. Our results reveal substantial variation in robustness across models: Virchow2 achieved the lowest slide-level encoding among large-scale models (81.0%) yet exhibited the second-lowest cross-slide accuracy (47.2%). HistoEncoder, trained specifically on prostate tissue, demonstrated the highest cross-slide accuracy (59.7%) and the strongest slide-level encoding (90.3%), suggesting tissue-specific training may enhance both biological feature capture and slide-specific signatures. All models exhibited measurable within-slide vs. cross-slide accuracy gaps, though the magnitude varied from 19.9 percentage points to 26.9 percentage points. We provide an open-source Google Colab notebook enabling researchers to evaluate additional foundation models against our benchmark using standardized metrics. PANDA-PLUS-Bench addresses a critical gap in foundation model evaluation by providing a purpose-built resource for robustness assessment in the clinically important context of Gleason grading.

Abstract: Gliomas are the most common malignant brain tumors in adults and are among the most lethal. Despite aggressive treatment, the median survival rate is less than 15 months. Accurate multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) tumor segmentation is critical for surgical planning, radiotherapy, and disease monitoring. While deep learning models have improved the accuracy of automated segmentation, large-scale pre-trained models generalize poorly and often underperform, producing systematic errors such as false positives, label swaps, and slice discontinuities in slices. These limitations are further compounded by unequal access to GPU resources and the growing environmental cost of large-scale model training. In this work, we propose adaptive post-processing techniques to refine the quality of glioma segmentations produced by large-scale pretrained models developed for various types of tumors. We demonstrated the techniques in multiple BraTS 2025 segmentation challenge tasks, with the ranking metric improving by 14.9 % for the sub-Saharan Africa challenge and 0.9% for the adult glioma challenge. This approach promotes a shift in brain tumor segmentation research from increasingly complex model architectures to efficient, clinically aligned post-processing strategies that are precise, computationally fair, and sustainable.

TL;DR: TalkVerse是一个大规模、开放的有声单人说话视频生成数据集，包含230万条高分辨率（720p/1080p）音频视频同步片段，总时长6300小时，旨在支持公平、可复现的方法比较。文章还基于该数据集提出了一个可复现的50亿参数DiT基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的说话视频生成系统依赖于封闭数据或计算密集型模型，缺乏公平、可复现的比较基准。TalkVerse旨在提供一个开放的大规模数据集以降低该领域的研究门槛。

Method: 1) 数据集构建：从超过6万小时视频中通过场景切割检测、美学评估、严格音视频同步检查和全面标注（包括2D骨架和结构化视觉/音频风格描述）来筛选高质量片段。2) 模型设计：基于Wan2.2-5B构建50亿参数DiT模型，采用高下采样比的视频VAE、滑动窗口机制和运动帧上下文，并集成MLLM导演根据音视频线索重写提示词，以及通过受控潜在噪声注入实现零样本视频配音。

Result: 提出的模型能够生成长达一分钟的视频且偏移低，在唇部同步和视觉质量上与140亿参数的Wan-S2V模型相当，但推理成本降低10倍。模型还支持通过MLLM导演增强长视频的叙事性，并实现零样本视频配音。

Conclusion: TalkVerse数据集、训练方案和50亿参数检查点均已开源，旨在推动音频驱动的人体视频生成研究，提供公平比较的基础并降低研究门槛。

Abstract: We introduce TalkVerse, a large-scale, open corpus for single-person, audio-driven talking video generation designed to enable fair, reproducible comparison across methods. While current state-of-the-art systems rely on closed data or compute-heavy models, TalkVerse offers 2.3 million high-resolution (720p/1080p) audio-video synchronized clips totaling 6.3k hours. These are curated from over 60k hours of video via a transparent pipeline that includes scene-cut detection, aesthetic assessment, strict audio-visual synchronization checks, and comprehensive annotations including 2D skeletons and structured visual/audio-style captions. Leveraging TalkVerse, we present a reproducible 5B DiT baseline built on Wan2.2-5B. By utilizing a video VAE with a high downsampling ratio and a sliding window mechanism with motion-frame context, our model achieves minute-long generation with low drift. It delivers comparable lip-sync and visual quality to the 14B Wan-S2V model but with 10$\times$ lower inference cost. To enhance storytelling in long videos, we integrate an MLLM director to rewrite prompts based on audio and visual cues. Furthermore, our model supports zero-shot video dubbing via controlled latent noise injection. We open-source the dataset, training recipes, and 5B checkpoints to lower barriers for research in audio-driven human video generation. Project Page: https://zhenzhiwang.github.io/talkverse/

TL;DR: PC-GRPO是一种无需监督的强化学习配方，通过自监督拼图环境和动态课程解决VLM推理中的注释依赖、奖励稀疏和逻辑一致性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前VLM推理方法存在的三个关键问题：对昂贵噪声注释或外部验证的依赖、GRPO中平坦稀疏的奖励方案、以及推理链与最终答案之间的逻辑不一致性。

Method: 采用无监督配方PC-GRPO，使用三个自监督拼图环境（PatchFit、Rotation、Jigsaw）替代标注；引入难度感知课程动态加权样本；监控并增强推理-答案一致性。

Result: 在多种基准测试和Qwen-7B/3B骨干上，PC-GRPO提高了推理质量、训练稳定性和端任务准确率，推理-答案一致性与下游准确率正相关。

Conclusion: PC-GRPO为VLM提供了一条可扩展、可验证、可解释的强化学习后训练实用路径，无需标注或外部验证器。

Abstract: Recent reinforcement learning (RL) approaches like outcome-supervised GRPO have advanced chain-of-thought reasoning in Vision Language Models (VLMs), yet key issues linger: (i) reliance on costly and noisy hand-curated annotations or external verifiers; (ii) flat and sparse reward schemes in GRPO; and (iii) logical inconsistency between a chain's reasoning and its final answer. We present Puzzle Curriculum GRPO (PC-GRPO), a supervision-free recipe for RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) that strengthens visual reasoning in VLMs without annotations or external verifiers. PC-GRPO replaces labels with three self-supervised puzzle environments: PatchFit, Rotation (with binary rewards) and Jigsaw (with graded partial credit mitigating reward sparsity). To counter flat rewards and vanishing group-relative advantages, we introduce a difficulty-aware curriculum that dynamically weights samples and peaks at medium difficulty. We further monitor Reasoning-Answer Consistency (RAC) during post-training: mirroring reports for vanilla GRPO in LLMs, RAC typically rises early then degrades; our curriculum delays this decline, and consistency-enforcing reward schemes further boost RAC. RAC correlates with downstream accuracy. Across diverse benchmarks and on Qwen-7B and Qwen-3B backbones, PC-GRPO improves reasoning quality, training stability, and end-task accuracy, offering a practical path to scalable, verifiable, and interpretable RL post-training for VLMs.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Person recognition systems often rely on audio, visual, or behavioral cues, but real-world conditions frequently result in missing or degraded modalities. To address this challenge, we propose a Trimodal person identification framework that integrates voice, face, and gesture modalities, while remaining robust to modality loss. Our approach leverages multi-task learning to process each modality independently, followed by a cross-attention and gated fusion mechanisms to facilitate interaction across modalities. Moreover, a confidence-weighted fusion strategy dynamically adapts to missing and low-quality data, ensuring optimal classification even in Unimodal or Bimodal scenarios. We evaluate our method on CANDOR, a newly introduced interview-based multimodal dataset, which we benchmark for the first time. Our results demonstrate that the proposed Trimodal system achieves 99.18% Top-1 accuracy on person identification tasks, outperforming conventional Unimodal and late-fusion approaches. In addition, we evaluate our model on the VoxCeleb1 dataset as a benchmark and reach 99.92% accuracy in Bimodal mode. Moreover, we show that our system maintains high accuracy even when one or two modalities are unavailable, making it a robust solution for real-world person recognition applications. The code and data for this work are publicly available.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The LUMIR challenge represents an important benchmark for evaluating deformable image registration methods on large-scale neuroimaging data. While the challenge demonstrates that modern deep learning methods achieve competitive accuracy on T1-weighted MRI, it also claims exceptional zero-shot generalization to unseen contrasts and resolutions, assertions that contradict established understanding of domain shift in deep learning. In this paper, we perform an independent re-evaluation of these zero-shot claims using rigorous evaluation protocols while addressing potential sources of instrumentation bias. Our findings reveal a more nuanced picture: (1) deep learning methods perform comparably to iterative optimization on in-distribution T1w images and even on human-adjacent species (macaque), demonstrating improved task understanding; (2) however, performance degrades significantly on out-of-distribution contrasts (T2, T2*, FLAIR), with Cohen's d scores ranging from 0.7-1.5, indicating substantial practical impact on downstream clinical workflows; (3) deep learning methods face scalability limitations on high-resolution data, failing to run on 0.6 mm isotropic images, while iterative methods benefit from increased resolution; and (4) deep methods exhibit high sensitivity to preprocessing choices. These results align with the well-established literature on domain shift and suggest that claims of universal zero-shot superiority require careful scrutiny. We advocate for evaluation protocols that reflect practical clinical and research workflows rather than conditions that may inadvertently favor particular method classes.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Recent advances in generative AI have enabled the creation of highly realistic digital content, raising concerns around authenticity, ownership, and misuse. While watermarking has become an increasingly important mechanism to trace and protect digital media, most existing image watermarking schemes operate as black boxes, producing global detection scores without offering any insight into how or where the watermark is present. This lack of transparency impacts user trust and makes it difficult to interpret the impact of tampering. In this paper, we present a post-hoc image watermarking method that combines localised embedding with region-level interpretability. Our approach embeds watermark signals in the discrete wavelet transform domain using a statistical block-wise strategy. This allows us to generate detection maps that reveal which regions of an image are likely watermarked or altered. We show that our method achieves strong robustness against common image transformations while remaining sensitive to semantic manipulations. At the same time, the watermark remains highly imperceptible. Compared to prior post-hoc methods, our approach offers more interpretable detection while retaining competitive robustness. For example, our watermarks are robust to cropping up to half the image.

Abstract: Precision livestock farming requires objective assessment of social behavior to support herd welfare monitoring, yet most existing approaches infer interactions using static proximity thresholds that cannot distinguish affiliative from agonistic behaviors in complex barn environments. This limitation constrains the interpretability of automated social network analysis in commercial settings. We present a pose-based computational framework for interaction classification that moves beyond proximity heuristics by modeling the spatiotemporal geometry of anatomical keypoints. Rather than relying on pixel-level appearance or simple distance measures, the proposed method encodes interaction-specific motion signatures from keypoint trajectories, enabling differentiation of social interaction valence. The framework is implemented as an end-to-end computer vision pipeline integrating YOLOv11 for object detection (mAP@0.50: 96.24%), supervised individual identification (98.24% accuracy), ByteTrack for multi-object tracking (81.96% accuracy), ZebraPose for 27-point anatomical keypoint estimation, and a support vector machine classifier trained on pose-derived distance dynamics. On annotated interaction clips collected from a commercial dairy barn, the classifier achieved 77.51% accuracy in distinguishing affiliative and agonistic behaviors using pose information alone. Comparative evaluation against a proximity-only baseline shows substantial gains in behavioral discrimination, particularly for affiliative interactions. The results establish a proof-of-concept for automated, vision-based inference of social interactions suitable for constructing interaction-aware social networks, with near-real-time performance on commodity hardware.

Abstract: Skilled human interviewers can extract valuable information from experts. This raises a fundamental question: what makes some questions more effective than others? To address this, a quantitative evaluation of question-generation models is essential. Video question generation (VQG) is a topic for video question answering (VideoQA), where questions are generated for given answers. Their evaluation typically focuses on the ability to answer questions, rather than the quality of generated questions. In contrast, we focus on the question quality in eliciting unseen knowledge from human experts. For a continuous improvement of VQG models, we propose a protocol that evaluates the ability by simulating question-answering communication with experts using a question-to-answer retrieval. We obtain the retriever by constructing a novel dataset, EgoExoAsk, which comprises 27,666 QA pairs generated from Ego-Exo4D's expert commentary annotation. The EgoExoAsk training set is used to obtain the retriever, and the benchmark is constructed on the validation set with Ego-Exo4D video segments. Experimental results demonstrate our metric reasonably aligns with question generation settings: models accessing richer context are evaluated better, supporting that our protocol works as intended. The EgoExoAsk dataset is available in https://github.com/omron-sinicx/VQG4ExpertKnowledge .

Abstract: Preference optimization offers a scalable supervision paradigm based on relative preference signals, yet prior attempts in medical image segmentation remain model-specific and rely on low-diversity prediction sampling. In this paper, we propose MAPO (Model-Agnostic Preference Optimization), a training framework that utilizes Dropout-driven stochastic segmentation hypotheses to construct preference-consistent gradients without direct ground-truth supervision. MAPO is fully architecture- and dimensionality-agnostic, supporting 2D/3D CNN and Transformer-based segmentation pipelines. Comprehensive evaluations across diverse medical datasets reveal that MAPO consistently enhances boundary adherence, reduces overfitting, and yields more stable optimization dynamics compared to conventional supervised training.

Abstract: Scenes reconstructed by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) trained on low-resolution (LR) images are unsuitable for high-resolution (HR) rendering. Consequently, a 3DGS super-resolution (SR) method is needed to bridge LR inputs and HR rendering. Early 3DGS SR methods rely on single-image SR networks, which lack cross-view consistency and fail to fuse complementary information across views. More recent video-based SR approaches attempt to address this limitation but require strictly sequential frames, limiting their applicability to unstructured multi-view datasets. In this work, we introduce Multi-View Consistent 3D Gaussian Splatting Super-Resolution (MVGSR), a framework that focuses on integrating multi-view information for 3DGS rendering with high-frequency details and enhanced consistency. We first propose an Auxiliary View Selection Method based on camera poses, making our method adaptable for arbitrarily organized multi-view datasets without the need of temporal continuity or data reordering. Furthermore, we introduce, for the first time, an epipolar-constrained multi-view attention mechanism into 3DGS SR, which serves as the core of our proposed multi-view SR network. This design enables the model to selectively aggregate consistent information from auxiliary views, enhancing the geometric consistency and detail fidelity of 3DGS representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both object-centric and scene-level 3DGS SR benchmarks.

Abstract: Large-scale structures suffer high-frequency deformations due to complex loads. However, harsh lighting conditions and high equipment costs limit measurement methods based on traditional high-speed cameras. This paper proposes a method to measure high-frequency deformations by exploiting an event camera and LED markers. Firstly, observation noise is filtered based on the characteristics of the event stream generated by LED markers blinking and spatiotemporal correlation. Then, LED markers are extracted from the event stream after differentiating between motion-induced events and events from LED blinking, which enables the extraction of high-speed moving LED markers. Ultimately, high-frequency planar deformations are measured by a monocular event camera. Experimental results confirm the accuracy of our method in measuring high-frequency planar deformations.

Abstract: Medical ultrasound videos are widely used for medical inspections, disease diagnosis and surgical planning. High-fidelity lesion area and target organ segmentation constitutes a key component of the computer-assisted surgery workflow. The low contrast levels and noisy backgrounds of ultrasound videos cause missegmentation of organ boundary, which may lead to small object losses and increase boundary segmentation errors. Object tracking in long videos also remains a significant research challenge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a memory bank-based wavelet filtering and fusion network, which adopts an encoder-decoder structure to effectively extract fine-grained detailed spatial features and integrate high-frequency (HF) information. Specifically, memory-based wavelet convolution is presented to simultaneously capture category, detailed information and utilize adjacent information in the encoder. Cascaded wavelet compression is used to fuse multiscale frequency-domain features and expand the receptive field within each convolutional layer. A long short-term memory bank using cross-attention and memory compression mechanisms is designed to track objects in long video. To fully utilize the boundary-sensitive HF details of feature maps, an HF-aware feature fusion module is designed via adaptive wavelet filters in the decoder. In extensive benchmark tests conducted on four ultrasound video datasets (two thyroid nodule, the thyroid gland, the heart datasets) compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method demonstrates marked improvements in segmentation metrics. In particular, our method can more accurately segment small thyroid nodules, demonstrating its effectiveness for cases involving small ultrasound objects in long video.

Abstract: Generating consistent human images with controllable pose and appearance is essential for applications in virtual try on, image editing, and digital human creation. Current methods often suffer from occlusions, garment style drift, and pose misalignment. We propose Pose-guided Multi-view Multimodal Diffusion (PMMD), a diffusion framework that synthesizes photorealistic person images conditioned on multi-view references, pose maps, and text prompts. A multimodal encoder jointly models visual views, pose features, and semantic descriptions, which reduces cross modal discrepancy and improves identity fidelity. We further design a ResCVA module to enhance local detail while preserving global structure, and a cross modal fusion module that integrates image semantics with text throughout the denoising pipeline. Experiments on the DeepFashion MultiModal dataset show that PMMD outperforms representative baselines in consistency, detail preservation, and controllability.

Motivation: 研究旨在探索商业文本到图像生成模型Nano Banana Pro作为低层视觉通用求解器的潜力，了解其在多种低层视觉任务中的零样本表现能力。

Method: 采用简单文本提示进行零样本评估，覆盖14个不同低层视觉任务的40个多样化数据集，并与最先进的专用模型进行基准对比分析。

Result: 研究表明Nano Banana Pro展现出明显的性能二分性：主观视觉质量优异，能产生超越专业模型的合理高频细节，但在基于参考的传统量化指标上落后于专业模型。

Conclusion: Nano Banana Pro是低层视觉任务中一个有能力的零样本竞争者，但要达到领域专家的高保真度仍然是一个重大挑战，生成模型的随机性使其难以满足传统度量对像素级一致性的严格要求。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of text-to-image generation models has revolutionized visual content creation. While commercial products like Nano Banana Pro have garnered significant attention, their potential as generalist solvers for traditional low-level vision challenges remains largely underexplored. In this study, we investigate the critical question: Is Nano Banana Pro a Low-Level Vision All-Rounder? We conducted a comprehensive zero-shot evaluation across 14 distinct low-level tasks spanning 40 diverse datasets. By utilizing simple textual prompts without fine-tuning, we benchmarked Nano Banana Pro against state-of-the-art specialist models. Our extensive analysis reveals a distinct performance dichotomy: while \textbf{Nano Banana Pro demonstrates superior subjective visual quality}, often hallucinating plausible high-frequency details that surpass specialist models, it lags behind in traditional reference-based quantitative metrics. We attribute this discrepancy to the inherent stochasticity of generative models, which struggle to maintain the strict pixel-level consistency required by conventional metrics. This report identifies Nano Banana Pro as a capable zero-shot contender for low-level vision tasks, while highlighting that achieving the high fidelity of domain specialists remains a significant hurdle.

Abstract: 3D animation is central to modern visual media, yet traditional production pipelines remain labor-intensive, expertise-demanding, and computationally expensive. Recent AIGC-based approaches partially automate asset creation and rigging, but they either inherit the heavy costs of full 3D pipelines or rely on video-synthesis paradigms that sacrifice 3D controllability and interactivity. We focus on single-image 3D animation generation and argue that progress is fundamentally constrained by a trade-off between rendering quality and 3D control.
  To address this limitation, we propose a lightweight 3D animation framework that decouples geometric control from appearance synthesis. The core idea is a 2D-3D aligned proxy representation that uses a coarse 3D estimate as a structural carrier, while delegating high-fidelity appearance and view synthesis to learned image-space generative priors. This proxy formulation enables 3D-aware motion control and interaction comparable to classical pipelines, without requiring accurate geometry or expensive optimization, and naturally extends to coherent background animation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves efficient animation generation on low-power platforms and outperforms video-based 3D animation generation in identity preservation, geometric and textural consistency, and the level of precise, interactive control it offers to users.

Abstract: Evaluating whether human action is standard or not and providing reasonable feedback to improve action standardization is very crucial but challenging in real-world scenarios. However, current video understanding methods are mainly concerned with what and where the action is, which is unable to meet the requirements. Meanwhile, most of the existing datasets lack the labels indicating the degree of action standardization, and the action quality assessment datasets lack explainability and detailed feedback. Therefore, we define a new Human Action Form Assessment (AFA) task, and introduce a new diverse dataset CoT-AFA, which contains a large scale of fitness and martial arts videos with multi-level annotations for comprehensive video analysis. We enrich the CoT-AFA dataset with a novel Chain-of-Thought explanation paradigm. Instead of offering isolated feedback, our explanations provide a complete reasoning process--from identifying an action step to analyzing its outcome and proposing a concrete solution. Furthermore, we propose a framework named Explainable Fitness Assessor, which can not only judge an action but also explain why and provide a solution. This framework employs two parallel processing streams and a dynamic gating mechanism to fuse visual and semantic information, thereby boosting its analytical capabilities. The experimental results demonstrate that our method has achieved improvements in explanation generation (e.g., +16.0% in CIDEr), action classification (+2.7% in accuracy) and quality assessment (+2.1% in accuracy), revealing great potential of CoT-AFA for future studies. Our dataset and source code is available at https://github.com/MICLAB-BUPT/EFA.

Abstract: Recent spatial intelligence approaches typically attach 3D cues to 2D reasoning pipelines or couple MLLMs with black-box reconstruction modules, leading to weak spatial consistency, limited viewpoint diversity, and evidence chains that cannot be traced back to supporting views. Frameworks for "thinking with images" (e.g., ChatGPT-o3 and DeepEyes) show that stepwise multimodal reasoning can emerge by interleaving hypothesis formation with active acquisition of visual evidence, but they do not address three key challenges in spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT): building global space perception under strict token budgets, explicitly associating 3D hypotheses with video frames for verification, and designing spatially grounded rewards for reinforcement learning. To address these issues, we present EagleVision, a dual-stage framework for progressive spatial cognition through macro perception and micro verification. In the macro perception stage, EagleVision employs a semantics-perspective-fusion determinantal point process (SPF-DPP) to select a compact set of geometry- and semantics-aware keyframes from long videos under a fixed token budget. In the micro verification stage, we formalize spatial CoT as BEV-grounded pose querying: the agent iteratively predicts poses on a BEV plane, retrieves the nearest real frames, and is trained purely by reinforcement learning with a spatial grounding reward that scores the consistency between predicted poses and observed views. On VSI-Bench, EagleVision achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source vision-language models, demonstrating strong and generalizable spatial understanding.

Abstract: Ensuring safety is the primary objective of automated driving, which necessitates a comprehensive and accurate perception of the environment. While numerous performance evaluation metrics exist for assessing perception capabilities, incorporating safety-specific metrics is essential to reliably evaluate object detection systems. A key component for safety evaluation is the ability to distinguish between relevant and non-relevant objects - a challenge addressed by criticality or relevance metrics. This paper presents the first in-depth analysis of criticality metrics for safety evaluation of object detection systems. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we identify and assess a range of applicable metrics. Their effectiveness is empirically validated using the DeepAccident dataset, which features a variety of safety-critical scenarios. To enhance evaluation accuracy, we propose two novel application strategies: bidirectional criticality rating and multi-metric aggregation. Our approach demonstrates up to a 100% improvement in terms of criticality classification accuracy, highlighting its potential to significantly advance the safety evaluation of object detection systems in automated vehicles.

Conclusion: 重合成框架为解决深度伪造检测的不可靠性和缺乏鲁棒性问题提供有效方案，通过校准重合成实现可靠的真实性验证和对计算受限对手的鲁棒性防御。

Abstract: Generative models can synthesize highly realistic content, so-called deepfakes, that are already being misused at scale to undermine digital media authenticity. Current deepfake detection methods are unreliable for two reasons: (i) distinguishing inauthentic content post-hoc is often impossible (e.g., with memorized samples), leading to an unbounded false positive rate (FPR); and (ii) detection lacks robustness, as adversaries can adapt to known detectors with near-perfect accuracy using minimal computational resources. To address these limitations, we propose a resynthesis framework to determine if a sample is authentic or if its authenticity can be plausibly denied. We make two key contributions focusing on the high-precision, low-recall setting against efficient (i.e., compute-restricted) adversaries. First, we demonstrate that our calibrated resynthesis method is the most reliable approach for verifying authentic samples while maintaining controllable, low FPRs. Second, we show that our method achieves adversarial robustness against efficient adversaries, whereas prior methods are easily evaded under identical compute budgets. Our approach supports multiple modalities and leverages state-of-the-art inversion techniques.

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion is a pivotal technology in low-altitude UAV reconnaissance missions, providing high-quality data support for downstream tasks such as target detection and tracking by integrating thermal saliency with background texture details.However, traditional no-reference metrics fail(Specifically,like Entropy (EN) and Average Gradient (AG)) in complex low-light environments. They often misinterpret high-frequency sensor noise as valid detail. This creates a "Noise Trap," paradoxically assigning higher scores to noisy images and misguiding fusion algorithms.To address this, we propose the Target-Background Contrast (TBC) metric. Inspired by Weber's Law, TBC focuses on the relative contrast of salient targets rather than global statistics. Unlike traditional metrics, TBC penalizes background noise and rewards target visibility. Experiments on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that TBC aligns better with human perception and provides a reliable standard for low-altitude scenarios.

Conclusion: Mesh-Plug通过准确估计相机旋转参数，实现了从相机坐标系到世界坐标系的精确人体网格转换，解决了野外图像中3D人体网格重建的挑战。

Abstract: Reconstructing accurate 3D human meshes in the world coordinate system from in-the-wild images remains challenging due to the lack of camera rotation information. While existing methods achieve promising results in the camera coordinate system by assuming zero camera rotation, this simplification leads to significant errors when transforming the reconstructed mesh to the world coordinate system. To address this challenge, we propose Mesh-Plug, a plug-and-play module that accurately transforms human meshes from camera coordinates to world coordinates. Our key innovation lies in a human-centered approach that leverages both RGB images and depth maps rendered from the initial mesh to estimate camera rotation parameters, eliminating the dependency on environmental cues. Specifically, we first train a camera rotation prediction module that focuses on the human body's spatial configuration to estimate camera pitch angle. Then, by integrating the predicted camera parameters with the initial mesh, we design a mesh adjustment module that simultaneously refines the root joint orientation and body pose. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the benchmark datasets SPEC-SYN and SPEC-MTP.

Motivation: 现有参数高效微调方法（如LoRA）在全参数空间进行低秩适应，但研究发现预训练模型存在非平凡零空间，在该子空间内微调能达到相似效果。这激发了在零空间内进行低秩适应的想法，以进一步提升参数效率。

Method: 提出Null-LoRA方法：1) 通过冻结部分低秩矩阵减少冗余，提高有效秩；2) 将整个增量更新约束在零空间内，最大化增量更新在新任务范式中的利用率。

Result: 在图像文本检索和视觉问答任务的广泛实验中，Null-LoRA以更少的参数超越了现有最先进方法的性能。

Conclusion: Null-LoRA通过零空间约束有效减少了参数冗余，在保持性能的同时显著提升了参数效率，为大型模型的参数高效微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods have gained considerable popularity for adapting large-scale models to downstream tasks, particularly LoRA and its variants. Existing methods perform low-rank adaptation over the full parameter space. However, fine-tuning within a subspace can achieve comparable effectiveness. Inspired by the observation that pre-trained models possess non-trivial null spaces, we propose Null-space based Low-Rank Adaptation (Null-LoRA). Null-LoRA effectively reduces redundancy and enhances effective rank by freezing portions of the low-rank matrices. To further improve parameter efficiency, Null-LoRA constrains the entire incremental update within the null space, maximizing the utilization of incremental updates to adapt to new task paradigms. Null-LoRA surpasses the state of the art with fewer parameters in extensive experiments across image-text retrieval and visual question answering tasks.

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly multimodal vision-language models (VLM), often exhibit intersectional biases where models are systematically less confident in diagnosing marginalised patient subgroups. Such bias can lead to higher rates of inaccurate and missed diagnoses due to demographically skewed data and divergent distributions of diagnostic certainty. Current fairness interventions frequently fail to address these gaps or compromise overall diagnostic performance to achieve statistical parity among the subgroups. In this study, we developed Cross-Modal Alignment Consistency (CMAC-MMD), a training framework that standardises diagnostic certainty across intersectional patient subgroups. Unlike traditional debiasing methods, this approach equalises the model's decision confidence without requiring sensitive demographic data during clinical inference. We evaluated this approach using 10,015 skin lesion images (HAM10000) with external validation on 12,000 images (BCN20000), and 10,000 fundus images for glaucoma detection (Harvard-FairVLMed), stratifying performance by intersectional age, gender, and race attributes. In the dermatology cohort, the proposed method reduced the overall intersectional missed diagnosis gap (difference in True Positive Rate, $Δ$TPR) from 0.50 to 0.26 while improving the overall Area Under the Curve (AUC) from 0.94 to 0.97 compared to standard training. Similarly, for glaucoma screening, the method reduced $Δ$TPR from 0.41 to 0.31, achieving a better AUC of 0.72 (vs. 0.71 baseline). This establishes a scalable framework for developing high-stakes clinical decision support systems that are both accurate and can perform equitably across diverse patient subgroups, ensuring reliable performance without increasing privacy risks.

Abstract: Counting the number of items in a visual scene remains a fundamental yet challenging task in computer vision. Traditional approaches to solving this problem rely on domain-specific counting architectures, which are trained using datasets annotated with a predefined set of object categories. However, recent progress in creating large-scale multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) suggests that these domain-general architectures may offer a flexible alternative for open-set object counting. In this study, we therefore systematically compare the performance of state-of-the-art specialized counting architectures against VLMs on two popular counting datasets, as well as on a novel benchmark specifically created to have a finer-grained control over the visual properties of test images. Our findings show that most VLMs can approximately enumerate the number of items in a visual scene, matching or even surpassing the performance of specialized computer vision architectures. Notably, enumeration accuracy significantly improves when VLMs are prompted to generate intermediate representations (i.e., locations and verbal labels) of each object to be counted. Nevertheless, none of the models can reliably count the number of objects in complex visual scenes, showing that further research is still needed to create AI systems that can reliably deploy counting procedures in realistic environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN方法固定卷积操作限制了其对空间和光谱变化的适应性，而交叉注意力机制虽支持全局交互但计算效率低且易稀释细粒度对应关系。最新MMDiT架构在图像生成和编辑中表现出色，采用上下文条件化实现更直接高效的跨模态信息交换，但仍有改进空间。

Method: MMMamba基于Mamba架构，设计线性计算复杂度同时保持强大跨模态交互能力，引入新颖的多模态交错（MI）扫描机制，促进PAN和MS模态间的有效信息交换，支持零样本图像超分辨率。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在多个任务和基准测试中优于现有最先进技术，展现了卓越的性能表现。

Conclusion: MMMamba通过创新的跨模态上下文融合机制，成功解决了全色锐化中的跨模态信息集成问题，为遥感图像处理提供了高效、性能优异的解决方案。

Abstract: Pan-sharpening aims to generate high-resolution multispectral (HRMS) images by integrating a high-resolution panchromatic (PAN) image with its corresponding low-resolution multispectral (MS) image. To achieve effective fusion, it is crucial to fully exploit the complementary information between the two modalities. Traditional CNN-based methods typically rely on channel-wise concatenation with fixed convolutional operators, which limits their adaptability to diverse spatial and spectral variations. While cross-attention mechanisms enable global interactions, they are computationally inefficient and may dilute fine-grained correspondences, making it difficult to capture complex semantic relationships. Recent advances in the Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT) architecture have demonstrated impressive success in image generation and editing tasks. Unlike cross-attention, MMDiT employs in-context conditioning to facilitate more direct and efficient cross-modal information exchange. In this paper, we propose MMMamba, a cross-modal in-context fusion framework for pan-sharpening, with the flexibility to support image super-resolution in a zero-shot manner. Built upon the Mamba architecture, our design ensures linear computational complexity while maintaining strong cross-modal interaction capacity. Furthermore, we introduce a novel multimodal interleaved (MI) scanning mechanism that facilitates effective information exchange between the PAN and MS modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques across multiple tasks and benchmarks.

Abstract: We present the first cross-modality distillation framework specifically tailored for single-panoramic-camera Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) segmentation. Our approach leverages a novel LiDAR image representation fused from range, intensity and ambient channels, together with a voxel-aligned view transformer that preserves spatial fidelity while enabling efficient BEV processing. During training, a high-capacity LiDAR and camera fusion Teacher network extracts both rich spatial and semantic features for cross-modality knowledge distillation into a lightweight Student network that relies solely on a single 360-degree panoramic camera image. Extensive experiments on the Dur360BEV dataset demonstrate that our teacher model significantly outperforms existing camera-based BEV segmentation methods, achieving a 25.6\% IoU improvement. Meanwhile, the distilled Student network attains competitive performance with an 8.5\% IoU gain and state-of-the-art inference speed of 31.2 FPS. Moreover, evaluations on KITTI-360 (two fisheye cameras) confirm that our distillation framework generalises to diverse camera setups, underscoring its feasibility and robustness. This approach reduces sensor complexity and deployment costs while providing a practical solution for efficient, low-cost BEV segmentation in real-world autonomous driving.

Abstract: Motion artifacts degrade MRI image quality and increase patient recalls. Existing automated quality assessment methods are largely limited to binary decisions and provide little interpretability. We introduce AutoMAC-MRI, an explainable framework for grading motion artifacts across heterogeneous MR contrasts and orientations. The approach uses supervised contrastive learning to learn a discriminative representation of motion severity. Within this feature space, we compute grade-specific affinity scores that quantify an image's proximity to each motion grade, thereby making grade assignments transparent and interpretable. We evaluate AutoMAC-MRI on more than 5000 expert-annotated brain MRI slices spanning multiple contrasts and views. Experiments assessing affinity scores against expert labels show that the scores align well with expert judgment, supporting their use as an interpretable measure of motion severity. By coupling accurate grade detection with per-grade affinity scoring, AutoMAC-MRI enables inline MRI quality control, with the potential to reduce unnecessary rescans and improve workflow efficiency.

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is an effective image anomaly detection and localization scheme. However, a major drawback of this scheme is its tendency to overly generalize, primarily due to the similarities between input and supervisory signals. In order to address this issue, this paper introduces a novel technique called masked reverse knowledge distillation (MRKD). By employing image-level masking (ILM) and feature-level masking (FLM), MRKD transforms the task of image reconstruction into image restoration. Specifically, ILM helps to capture global information by differentiating input signals from supervisory signals. On the other hand, FLM incorporates synthetic feature-level anomalies to ensure that the learned representations contain sufficient local information. With these two strategies, MRKD is endowed with stronger image context capture capacity and is less likely to be overgeneralized. Experiments on the widely-used MVTec anomaly detection dataset demonstrate that MRKD achieves impressive performance: image-level 98.9% AU-ROC, pixel-level 98.4% AU-ROC, and 95.3% AU-PRO. In addition, extensive ablation experiments have validated the superiority of MRKD in mitigating the overgeneralization problem.

Motivation: 虽然视觉模型在物体检测、图像分类等任务上已取得高精度，但能够像人一样从图像中进行精确定量测量的模型仍然稀缺。为了实现实验室环境中机器人的完全自主操作，需要让其具备读取仪器测量值的基本能力。

Method: 采用人类启发的方法读取线性刻度测量值，以注射器和量筒为测试案例。首先对随机方向的注射器进行方向校正变换，然后将感兴趣区域缩小至仅包含线性刻度的部分，接着提取主要刻度线、对应数字和液位指示器位置等特征，最终计算出测量读数。

Result: 该系统获得的读数与人工读取的同一实例数值进行了比较，观察到了准确的对应关系。

Conclusion: 论文提出的视觉测量系统能够有效实现从线性刻度读取测量值的任务，为实验室环境中的机器人自主操作提供了重要能力基础。

Abstract: Capabilities and the number of vision-based models are increasing rapidly. And these vision models are now able to do more tasks like object detection, image classification, instance segmentation etc. with great accuracy. But models which can take accurate quantitative measurements form an image, as a human can do by just looking at it, are rare. For a robot to work with complete autonomy in a Laboratory environment, it needs to have some basic skills like navigation, handling objects, preparing samples etc. to match human-like capabilities in an unstructured environment. Another important capability is to read measurements from instruments and apparatus. Here, we tried to mimic a human inspired approach to read measurements from a linear scale. As a test case we have picked reading level from a syringe and a measuring cylinder. For a randomly oriented syringe we carry out transformations to correct the orientation. To make the system efficient and robust, the area of interest is reduced to just the linear scale containing part of the image. After that, a series of features were extracted like the major makers, the corresponding digits, and the level indicator location, from which the final reading was calculated. Readings obtained using this system were also compared against human read values of the same instances and an accurate correspondence was observed.

Abstract: Human conversation involves continuous exchanges of speech and nonverbal cues such as head nods, gaze shifts, and facial expressions that convey attention and emotion. Modeling these bidirectional dynamics in 3D is essential for building expressive avatars and interactive robots. However, existing frameworks often treat talking and listening as independent processes or rely on non-causal full-sequence modeling, hindering temporal coherence across turns. We present TIMAR (Turn-level Interleaved Masked AutoRegression), a causal framework for 3D conversational head generation that models dialogue as interleaved audio-visual contexts. It fuses multimodal information within each turn and applies turn-level causal attention to accumulate conversational history, while a lightweight diffusion head predicts continuous 3D head dynamics that captures both coordination and expressive variability. Experiments on the DualTalk benchmark show that TIMAR reduces Fréchet Distance and MSE by 15-30% on the test set, and achieves similar gains on out-of-distribution data. The source code will be released in the GitHub repository https://github.com/CoderChen01/towards-seamleass-interaction.

Motivation: GRPO在大规模生成模型对齐中面临计算成本与群体规模之间的冲突，需要一种更高效的方法来平衡优化效果与计算资源。

Method: 首先提出静态的Optimal Variance Filtering (OVF)策略选择高方差轨迹子集；然后提出Pro-GRPO动态框架，集成基于潜特征的轨迹修剪到采样过程中，采用'扩展-修剪'策略，先扩大初始采样群体规模以最大化轨迹多样性，再对潜特征应用多步OVF。

Result: 在基于扩散和流的模型上进行广泛实验，证明了Pro-GRPO框架的通用性和有效性。

Conclusion: Pro-GRPO通过动态轨迹修剪解决了GRPO的计算瓶颈，在保持优化效果的同时显著降低了计算开销。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a powerful technique for aligning generative models, but its effectiveness is bottlenecked by the conflict between large group sizes and prohibitive computational costs. In this work, we investigate the trade-off through empirical studies, yielding two key observations. First, we discover the reward clustering phenomenon in which many trajectories collapse toward the group-mean reward, offering limited optimization value. Second, we design a heuristic strategy named Optimal Variance Filtering (OVF), and verify that a high-variance subset of trajectories, selected by OVF can outperform the larger, unfiltered group. However, this static, post-sampling OVF approach still necessitates critical computational overhead, as it performs unnecessary sampling for trajectories that are ultimately discarded. To resolve this, we propose Pro-GRPO (Proactive GRPO), a novel dynamic framework that integrates latent feature-based trajectory pruning into the sampling process. Through the early termination of reward-clustered trajectories, Pro-GRPO reduces computational overhead. Leveraging its efficiency, Pro-GRPO employs an "Expand-and-Prune" strategy. This strategy first expands the size of initial sampling group to maximize trajectory diversity, then it applies multi-step OVF to the latents, avoiding prohibitive computational costs. Extensive experiments on both diffusion-based and flow-based models demonstrate the generality and effectiveness of our Pro-GRPO framework.

Abstract: We propose a novel dataset that has been specifically designed for 3D semantic segmentation of bridges and the domain gap analysis caused by varying sensors. This addresses a critical need in the field of infrastructure inspection and maintenance, which is essential for modern society. The dataset comprises high-resolution 3D scans of a diverse range of bridge structures from various countries, with detailed semantic labels provided for each. Our initial objective is to facilitate accurate and automated segmentation of bridge components, thereby advancing the structural health monitoring practice. To evaluate the effectiveness of existing 3D deep learning models on this novel dataset, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of three distinct state-of-the-art architectures. Furthermore, we present data acquired through diverse sensors to quantify the domain gap resulting from sensor variations. Our findings indicate that all architectures demonstrate robust performance on the specified task. However, the domain gap can potentially lead to a decline in the performance of up to 11.4% mIoU.

Abstract: Computer vision and video understanding have transformed sports analytics by enabling large-scale, automated analysis of game dynamics from broadcast footage. Despite significant advances in player and ball tracking, pose estimation, action localization, and automatic foul recognition, anticipating actions before they occur in sports videos has received comparatively little attention. This work introduces the task of action anticipation in basketball broadcast videos, focusing on predicting which team will gain possession of the ball following a shot attempt. To benchmark this task, a new self-curated dataset comprising 100,000 basketball video clips, over 300 hours of footage, and more than 2,000 manually annotated rebound events is presented. Comprehensive baseline results are reported using state-of-the-art action anticipation methods, representing the first application of deep learning techniques to basketball rebound prediction. Additionally, two complementary tasks, rebound classification and rebound spotting, are explored, demonstrating that this dataset supports a wide range of video understanding applications in basketball, for which no comparable datasets currently exist. Experimental results highlight both the feasibility and inherent challenges of anticipating rebounds, providing valuable insights into predictive modeling for dynamic multi-agent sports scenarios. By forecasting team possession before rebounds occur, this work enables applications in real-time automated broadcasting and post-game analysis tools to support decision-making.

Abstract: Multiplexed tissue imaging measures dozens of protein markers per cell, yet most deep learning models still apply early channel fusion, assuming shared structure across markers. We investigate whether preserving marker independence, combined with deliberately shallow architectures, provides a more suitable inductive bias for self-supervised representation learning in multiplex data than increasing model scale. Using a Hodgkin lymphoma CODEX dataset with 145,000 cells and 49 markers, we compare standard early-fusion CNNs with channel-separated architectures, including a marker-aware baseline and our novel shallow Channel-Independent Model (CIM-S) with 5.5K parameters. After contrastive pretraining and linear evaluation, early-fusion models show limited ability to retain marker-specific information and struggle particularly with rare-cell discrimination. Channel-independent architectures, and CIM-S in particular, achieve substantially stronger representations despite their compact size. These findings are consistent across multiple self-supervised frameworks, remain stable across augmentation settings, and are reproducible across both the 49-marker and reduced 18-marker settings. These results show that lightweight, channel-independent architectures can match or surpass deep early-fusion CNNs and foundation models for multiplex representation learning.

Abstract: Monocular depth foundation models achieve remarkable generalization by learning large-scale semantic priors, but this creates a critical vulnerability: they hallucinate illusory 3D structures from geometrically planar but perceptually ambiguous inputs. We term this failure the 3D Mirage. This paper introduces the first end-to-end framework to probe, quantify, and tame this unquantified safety risk. To probe, we present 3D-Mirage, the first benchmark of real-world illusions (e.g., street art) with precise planar-region annotations and context-restricted crops. To quantify, we propose a Laplacian-based evaluation framework with two metrics: the Deviation Composite Score (DCS) for spurious non-planarity and the Confusion Composite Score (CCS) for contextual instability. To tame this failure, we introduce Grounded Self-Distillation, a parameter-efficient strategy that surgically enforces planarity on illusion ROIs while using a frozen teacher to preserve background knowledge, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Our work provides the essential tools to diagnose and mitigate this phenomenon, urging a necessary shift in MDE evaluation from pixel-wise accuracy to structural and contextual robustness. Our code and benchmark will be publicly available to foster this exciting research direction.

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models unlock unprecedented opportunities for GUI automation. However, a fundamental challenge remains: how to efficiently acquire high-quality training data while maintaining annotation reliability? We introduce a self-evolving training pipeline powered by the Calibrated Step Reward System, which converts model-generated trajectories into reliable training signals through trajectory-level calibration, achieving >90% annotation accuracy with 10-100x lower cost. Leveraging this pipeline, we introduce Step-GUI, a family of models (4B/8B) that achieves state-of-the-art GUI performance (8B: 80.2% AndroidWorld, 48.5% OSWorld, 62.6% ScreenShot-Pro) while maintaining robust general capabilities. As GUI agent capabilities improve, practical deployment demands standardized interfaces across heterogeneous devices while protecting user privacy. To this end, we propose GUI-MCP, the first Model Context Protocol for GUI automation with hierarchical architecture that combines low-level atomic operations and high-level task delegation to local specialist models, enabling high-privacy execution where sensitive data stays on-device. Finally, to assess whether agents can handle authentic everyday usage, we introduce AndroidDaily, a benchmark grounded in real-world mobile usage patterns with 3146 static actions and 235 end-to-end tasks across high-frequency daily scenarios (8B: static 89.91%, end-to-end 52.50%). Our work advances the development of practical GUI agents and demonstrates strong potential for real-world deployment in everyday digital interactions.

Once leaked, these templates pose a threat: inverting them can yield photorealistic surrogates that compromise privacy and enable impersonation. Although existing research has achieved relatively realistic face template inversion, the reconstructed facial images exhibit over-smoothed facial-part attributes (eyes, nose, mouth) and limited transferability. To address this problem, we present CLIP-FTI, a CLIP-driven fine-grained attribute conditioning framework for face template inversion. Our core idea is to use the CLIP model to obtain the semantic embeddings of facial features, in order to realize the reconstruction of specific facial feature attributes. Specifically, facial feature attribute embeddings extracted from CLIP are fused with the leaked template via a cross-modal feature interaction network and projected into the intermediate latent space of a pretrained StyleGAN. The StyleGAN generator then synthesizes face images with the same identity as the templates but with more fine-grained facial feature attributes. Experiments across multiple face recognition backbones and datasets show that our reconstructions (i) achieve higher identification accuracy and attribute similarity, (ii) recover sharper component-level attribute semantics, and (iii) improve cross-model attack transferability compared to prior reconstruction attacks. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first method to use additional information besides the face template attack to realize face template inversion and obtains SOTA results.

### [49] [Evaluation of deep learning architectures for wildlife object detection: A comparative study of ResNet and Inception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15480)
*Malach Obisa Amonga,Benard Osero,Edna Too*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了ResNet-101和Inception v3在野生动物检测中的表现，两者都取得高准确率（94-95%）和高mAP（0.91-0.92），但遇到相似物种和困难环境条件时仍面临挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 野生动物目标检测对生物多样性保护、生态监测和栖息地保护至关重要，但面临环境变化大、物种视觉相似性高和类内多样性等挑战，需要评估深度学习模型在此复杂条件下的有效性。

Method: 使用野生动物图像数据集，采用标准化预处理（图像最大尺寸800像素、RGB转换、PyTorch张量转换），按70:30划分训练集和验证集，对比评估ResNet-101和Inception v3两种深度学习架构。

Result: ResNet-101分类准确率94%、mAP 0.91；Inception v3分类准确率95%、mAP 0.92，表现略优。两者在视觉相似物种或光照差、遮挡条件下检测仍有困难。

Conclusion: ResNet-101和Inception v3都是有效的野生动物目标检测模型，为保护性计算机视觉应用提供了可靠基础，但需要进一步改进以应对视觉相似性和环境挑战。

Abstract: Wildlife object detection plays a vital role in biodiversity conservation, ecological monitoring, and habitat protection. However, this task is often challenged by environmental variability, visual similarities among species, and intra-class diversity. This study investigates the effectiveness of two individual deep learning architectures ResNet-101 and Inception v3 for wildlife object detection under such complex conditions. The models were trained and evaluated on a wildlife image dataset using a standardized preprocessing approach, which included resizing images to a maximum dimension of 800 pixels, converting them to RGB format, and transforming them into PyTorch tensors. A ratio of 70:30 training and validation split was used for model development. The ResNet-101 model achieved a classification accuracy of 94% and a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.91, showing strong performance in extracting deep hierarchical features. The Inception v3 model performed slightly better, attaining a classification accuracy of 95% and a mAP of 0.92, attributed to its efficient multi-scale feature extraction through parallel convolutions. Despite the strong results, both models exhibited challenges when detecting species with similar visual characteristics or those captured under poor lighting and occlusion. Nonetheless, the findings confirm that both ResNet-101 and Inception v3 are effective models for wildlife object detection tasks and provide a reliable foundation for conservation-focused computer vision applications.

### [50] [RUMPL: Ray-Based Transformers for Universal Multi-View 2D to 3D Human Pose Lifting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15488)
*Seyed Abolfazl Ghasemzadeh,Alexandre Alahi,Christophe De Vleeschouwer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RUMPL，一种基于Transformer的3D姿态提升器，通过引入2D关键点的3D射线表示，实现独立于相机标定和视图数量的通用多视角部署，显著提升3D人体姿态估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多视角3D姿态估计方法受限于大规模真实标定数据的稀缺，难以泛化到真实场景。基于合成数据的2D到3D姿态提升方法虽能缓解，但仍依赖相机参数且适配性有限。

Method: 基于MPL框架，提出RUMPL：1）使用3D射线表示2D关键点，消除对相机标定和视图数量的依赖；2）设计View Fusion Transformer，通过融合射线token聚合多视角信息；3）支持任意多视角配置的无重训练部署。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，RUMPL相比三角测量降低MPJPE达53%，相比基于图像的Transformer基线降低超60%；在野外多视角、多人数据集上验证了鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: RUMPL通过射线表示和Transformer融合机制，实现了无需相机标定的通用多视角3D姿态估计，显著提升精度和泛化能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Estimating 3D human poses from 2D images remains challenging due to occlusions and projective ambiguity. Multi-view learning-based approaches mitigate these issues but often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios, as large-scale multi-view datasets with 3D ground truth are scarce and captured under constrained conditions. To overcome this limitation, recent methods rely on 2D pose estimation combined with 2D-to-3D pose lifting trained on synthetic data. Building on our previous MPL framework, we propose RUMPL, a transformer-based 3D pose lifter that introduces a 3D ray-based representation of 2D keypoints. This formulation makes the model independent of camera calibration and the number of views, enabling universal deployment across arbitrary multi-view configurations without retraining or fine-tuning. A new View Fusion Transformer leverages learned fused-ray tokens to aggregate information along rays, further improving multi-view consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RUMPL reduces MPJPE by up to 53% compared to triangulation and over 60% compared to transformer-based image-representation baselines. Results on new benchmarks, including in-the-wild multi-view and multi-person datasets, confirm its robustness and scalability.

Abstract: Feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models enable real-time scene generation but are hindered by suboptimal pixel-aligned primitive placement, which relies on a dense, rigid grid and limits both quality and efficiency. We introduce a new feed-forward architecture that detects 3D Gaussian primitives at a sub-pixel level, replacing the pixel grid with an adaptive, "Off The Grid" distribution. Inspired by keypoint detection, our multi-resolution decoder learns to distribute primitives across image patches. This module is trained end-to-end with a 3D reconstruction backbone using self-supervised learning. Our resulting pose-free model generates photorealistic scenes in seconds, achieving state-of-the-art novel view synthesis for feed-forward models. It outperforms competitors while using far fewer primitives, demonstrating a more accurate and efficient allocation that captures fine details and reduces artifacts. Moreover, we observe that by learning to render 3D Gaussians, our 3D reconstruction backbone improves camera pose estimation, suggesting opportunities to train these foundational models without labels.

Conclusion: 该框架将定量检测与人类可理解推理相结合，支持透明可靠的图像完整性评估，并提供了开源代码。

Abstract: Recent advances in AI-driven image generation have introduced new challenges for verifying the authenticity of digital evidence in forensic investigations. Modern generative models can produce visually consistent forgeries that evade traditional detectors based on pixel or compression artefacts. Most existing approaches also lack an explicit measure of anomaly intensity, which limits their ability to quantify the severity of manipulation. This paper introduces Vision-Attention Anomaly Scoring (VAAS), a novel dual-module framework that integrates global attention-based anomaly estimation using Vision Transformers (ViT) with patch-level self-consistency scoring derived from SegFormer embeddings. The hybrid formulation provides a continuous and interpretable anomaly score that reflects both the location and degree of manipulation. Evaluations on the DF2023 and CASIA v2.0 datasets demonstrate that VAAS achieves competitive F1 and IoU performance, while enhancing visual explainability through attention-guided anomaly maps. The framework bridges quantitative detection with human-understandable reasoning, supporting transparent and reliable image integrity assessment. The source code for all experiments and corresponding materials for reproducing the results are available open source.

Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的肖像动画方法无法实现头部姿态与面部表情的高保真解耦控制，限制了如仅表情或仅姿态编辑等应用场景的需求。

Method: 1) 设计运动训练器学习姿态和表情编码器提取分解的驱动信号；2) 通过双分支条件机制向扩散模型注入姿态变换，通过交叉注意力注入表情潜在编码；3) 设计渐进式混合无分类器引导以保持身份一致性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在动画质量和解耦可控性方面优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: DeX-Portrait能够实现高质量、解耦控制的肖像动画生成，为表情和姿态的独立编辑与动画提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Portrait animation from a single source image and a driving video is a long-standing problem. Recent approaches tend to adopt diffusion-based image/video generation models for realistic and expressive animation. However, none of these diffusion models realizes high-fidelity disentangled control between the head pose and facial expression, hindering applications like expression-only or pose-only editing and animation. To address this, we propose DeX-Portrait, a novel approach capable of generating expressive portrait animation driven by disentangled pose and expression signals. Specifically, we represent the pose as an explicit global transformation and the expression as an implicit latent code. First, we design a powerful motion trainer to learn both pose and expression encoders for extracting precise and decomposed driving signals. Then we propose to inject the pose transformation into the diffusion model through a dual-branch conditioning mechanism, and the expression latent through cross attention. Finally, we design a progressive hybrid classifier-free guidance for more faithful identity consistency. Experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both animation quality and disentangled controllability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于MLLMs的VEC方法通常将情感识别视为确定性任务，要求模型对每张图片输出单一明确的情感标签。这种做法未能充分考虑到情感感知固有的主观性，忽略了不同观者可能认为同样合理的替代解释。

Method: 1. 构建三阶段训练框架：第一阶段赋予结构化推理能力，第二阶段教授置信度表达，第三阶段校准置信度表达；2. 提出EmoCaliber模型，一个用于VEC的置信度感知型MLLM；3. 在统一基准VECBench上进行评估。

Result: 在VECBench基准测试中，EmoCaliber在情感预测和置信度估计两方面均展现出优于现有方法的整体性能，验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: EmoCaliber标志着向更可靠VEC系统迈出的可行一步，通过使MLLMs能够表达置信度，更好地处理了情感理解中的主观性问题，提升了实际应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Visual Emotion Comprehension (VEC) aims to infer sentiment polarities or emotion categories from affective cues embedded in images. In recent years, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have established a popular paradigm in VEC, leveraging their generalizability to unify VEC tasks defined under diverse emotion taxonomies. While this paradigm achieves notable success, it typically formulates VEC as a deterministic task, requiring the model to output a single, definitive emotion label for each image. Such a formulation insufficiently accounts for the inherent subjectivity of emotion perception, overlooking alternative interpretations that may be equally plausible to different viewers. To address this limitation, we propose equipping MLLMs with capabilities to verbalize their confidence in emotion predictions. This additional signal provides users with an estimate of both the plausibility of alternative interpretations and the MLLMs' self-assessed competence, thereby enhancing reliability in practice. Building on this insight, we introduce a three-stage training framework that progressively endows with structured reasoning, teaches to verbalize confidence, and calibrates confidence expression, culminating in EmoCaliber, a confidence-aware MLLM for VEC. Through fair and comprehensive evaluations on the unified benchmark VECBench, EmoCaliber demonstrates overall superiority against existing methods in both emotion prediction and confidence estimation. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and mark a feasible step toward more reliable VEC systems. Project page: https://github.com/wdqqdw/EmoCaliber.

Abstract: The remote sensing community has recently seen the emergence of methods based on Large Vision and Language Models (LVLMs) that can address multiple tasks at the intersection of computer vision and natural language processing. To fully exploit the potential of such models, a significant focus has been given to the collection of large amounts of training data that cover multiple remote sensing-specific tasks, such as image captioning or visual question answering. However, the cost of using and training LVLMs is high, due to the large number of parameters. While multiple parameter-efficient adaptation techniques have been explored, the computational costs of training and inference with these models can remain prohibitive for most institutions. In this work, we explore the use of encoder-only architectures and propose a model that can effectively address multi-task learning while remaining compact in terms of the number of parameters. In particular, our model tackles combinations of tasks that are not typically explored in a unified model: the generation of text from remote sensing images and cross-modal retrieval. The results of our GeoMELT model - named from Multi-task Efficient Learning Transformer - in established benchmarks confirm the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed approach.

Abstract: Ensuring the ethical use of video data involving human subjects, particularly infants, requires robust anonymization methods. We propose BLANKET (Baby-face Landmark-preserving ANonymization with Keypoint dEtection consisTency), a novel approach designed to anonymize infant faces in video recordings while preserving essential facial attributes. Our method comprises two stages. First, a new random face, compatible with the original identity, is generated via inpainting using a diffusion model. Second, the new identity is seamlessly incorporated into each video frame through temporally consistent face swapping with authentic expression transfer. The method is evaluated on a dataset of short video recordings of babies and is compared to the popular anonymization method, DeepPrivacy2. Key metrics assessed include the level of de-identification, preservation of facial attributes, impact on human pose estimation (as an example of a downstream task), and presence of artifacts. Both methods alter the identity, and our method outperforms DeepPrivacy2 in all other respects. The code is available as an easy-to-use anonymization demo at https://github.com/ctu-vras/blanket-infant-face-anonym.

Abstract: The text encoder is a critical component of text-to-image and text-to-video diffusion models, fundamentally determining the semantic fidelity of the generated content. However, its development has been hindered by two major challenges: the lack of an efficient evaluation framework that reliably predicts downstream generation performance, and the difficulty of effectively adapting pretrained language models for visual synthesis. To address these issues, we introduce GRAN-TED, a paradigm to Generate Robust, Aligned, and Nuanced Text Embeddings for Diffusion models. Our contribution is twofold. First, we propose TED-6K, a novel text-only benchmark that enables efficient and robust assessment of an encoder's representational quality without requiring costly end-to-end model training. We demonstrate that performance on TED-6K, standardized via a lightweight, unified adapter, strongly correlates with an encoder's effectiveness in downstream generation tasks. Second, guided by this validated framework, we develop a superior text encoder using a novel two-stage training paradigm. This process involves an initial fine-tuning stage on a Multimodal Large Language Model for better visual representation, followed by a layer-wise weighting method to extract more nuanced and potent text features. Our experiments show that the resulting GRAN-TED encoder not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on TED-6K but also leads to demonstrable performance gains in text-to-image and text-to-video generation. Our code is available at the following link: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GRAN-TED-4FCC/.

Abstract: Remote sensing (RS) image segmentation is constrained by the limited availability of annotated data and a gap between overhead imagery and natural images used to train foundational models. This motivates effective adaptation under limited supervision. SAM3 concept-driven framework generates masks from textual prompts without requiring task-specific modifications, which may enable this adaptation. We evaluate SAM3 for RS imagery across four target types, comparing textual, geometric, and hybrid prompting strategies, under lightweight fine-tuning scales with increasing supervision, alongside zero-shot inference. Results show that combining semantic and geometric cues yields the highest performance across targets and metrics. Text-only prompting exhibits the lowest performance, with marked score gaps for irregularly shaped targets, reflecting limited semantic alignment between SAM3 textual representations and their overhead appearances. Nevertheless, textual prompting with light fine-tuning offers a practical performance-effort trade-off for geometrically regular and visually salient targets. Across targets, performance improves between zero-shot inference and fine-tuning, followed by diminishing returns as the supervision scale increases. Namely, a modest geometric annotation effort is sufficient for effective adaptation. A persistent gap between Precision and IoU further indicates that under-segmentation and boundary inaccuracies remain prevalent error patterns in RS tasks, particularly for irregular and less prevalent targets.

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on online zero-shot monocular 3D instance segmentation, a novel practical setting where existing approaches fail to perform because they rely on posed RGB-D sequences. To overcome this limitation, we leverage CUT3R, a recent Reconstructive Foundation Model (RFM), to provide reliable geometric priors from a single RGB stream. We propose MoonSeg3R, which introduces three key components: (1) a self-supervised query refinement module with spatial-semantic distillation that transforms segmentation masks from 2D visual foundation models (VFMs) into discriminative 3D queries; (2) a 3D query index memory that provides temporal consistency by retrieving contextual queries; and (3) a state-distribution token from CUT3R that acts as a mask identity descriptor to strengthen cross-frame fusion. Experiments on ScanNet200 and SceneNN show that MoonSeg3R is the first method to enable online monocular 3D segmentation and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art RGB-D-based systems. Code and models will be released.

Abstract: High-performance Radar-Camera 3D object detection can be achieved by leveraging knowledge distillation without using LiDAR at inference time. However, existing distillation methods typically transfer modality-specific features directly to each sensor, which can distort their unique characteristics and degrade their individual strengths. To address this, we introduce IMKD, a radar-camera fusion framework based on multi-level knowledge distillation that preserves each sensor's intrinsic characteristics while amplifying their complementary strengths. IMKD applies a three-stage, intensity-aware distillation strategy to enrich the fused representation across the architecture: (1) LiDAR-to-Radar intensity-aware feature distillation to enhance radar representations with fine-grained structural cues, (2) LiDAR-to-Fused feature intensity-guided distillation to selectively highlight useful geometry and depth information at the fusion level, fostering complementarity between the modalities rather than forcing them to align, and (3) Camera-Radar intensity-guided fusion mechanism that facilitates effective feature alignment and calibration. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that IMKD reaches 67.0% NDS and 61.0% mAP, outperforming all prior distillation-based radar-camera fusion methods. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/dfki-av/IMKD/.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We introduce FlexAvatar, a method for creating high-quality and complete 3D head avatars from a single image. A core challenge lies in the limited availability of multi-view data and the tendency of monocular training to yield incomplete 3D head reconstructions. We identify the root cause of this issue as the entanglement between driving signal and target viewpoint when learning from monocular videos. To address this, we propose a transformer-based 3D portrait animation model with learnable data source tokens, so-called bias sinks, which enables unified training across monocular and multi-view datasets. This design leverages the strengths of both data sources during inference: strong generalization from monocular data and full 3D completeness from multi-view supervision. Furthermore, our training procedure yields a smooth latent avatar space that facilitates identity interpolation and flexible fitting to an arbitrary number of input observations. In extensive evaluations on single-view, few-shot, and monocular avatar creation tasks, we verify the efficacy of FlexAvatar. Many existing methods struggle with view extrapolation while FlexAvatar generates complete 3D head avatars with realistic facial animations. Website: https://tobias-kirschstein.github.io/flexavatar/

Abstract: Recent visual generative models often struggle with consistency during image editing due to the entangled nature of raster images, where all visual content is fused into a single canvas. In contrast, professional design tools employ layered representations, allowing isolated edits while preserving consistency. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{Qwen-Image-Layered}, an end-to-end diffusion model that decomposes a single RGB image into multiple semantically disentangled RGBA layers, enabling \textbf{inherent editability}, where each RGBA layer can be independently manipulated without affecting other content. To support variable-length decomposition, we introduce three key components: (1) an RGBA-VAE to unify the latent representations of RGB and RGBA images; (2) a VLD-MMDiT (Variable Layers Decomposition MMDiT) architecture capable of decomposing a variable number of image layers; and (3) a Multi-stage Training strategy to adapt a pretrained image generation model into a multilayer image decomposer. Furthermore, to address the scarcity of high-quality multilayer training images, we build a pipeline to extract and annotate multilayer images from Photoshop documents (PSD). Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses existing approaches in decomposition quality and establishes a new paradigm for consistent image editing.

Abstract: Estimating camera intrinsics and extrinsics is a fundamental problem in computer vision, and while advances in structure-from-motion (SfM) have improved accuracy and robustness, open challenges remain. In this paper, we introduce a robust method for pose estimation and calibration. We consider a set of rigid cameras, each observing the scene from a different perspective, which is a typical camera setup in animal behavior studies and forensic analysis of surveillance footage. Specifically, we analyse the individual components in a structure-from-motion (SfM) pipeline, and identify design choices that improve accuracy. Our main contributions are: (1) we investigate how to best subsample the predicted correspondences from a dense matcher to leverage them in the estimation process. (2) We investigate selection criteria for how to add the views incrementally. In a rigorous quantitative evaluation, we show the effectiveness of our changes, especially for cameras with strong radial distortion (79.9% ours vs. 40.4 vanilla VGGT). Finally, we demonstrate our correspondence subsampling in a global SfM setting where we initialize the poses using VGGT. The proposed pipeline generalizes across a wide range of camera setups, and could thus become a useful tool for animal behavior and forensic analysis.

Abstract: With the rapidly growing population of resident space objects (RSOs) in the near-Earth space environment, detailed information about their condition and capabilities is needed to provide Space Domain Awareness (SDA). Space-based sensing will enable inspection of RSOs at shorter ranges, independent of atmospheric effects, and from all aspects. The use of a sub-THz inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging and sensing system for SDA has been proposed in previous work, demonstrating the achievement of sub-cm image resolution at ranges of up to 100 km. This work focuses on recognition of external structures by use of sequential feature detection and tracking throughout the aligned ISAR images of the satellites. The Hough transform is employed to detect linear features, which are tracked throughout the sequence. ISAR imagery is generated via a metaheuristic simulator capable of modelling encounters for a variety of deployment scenarios. Initial frame-to-frame alignment is achieved through a series of affine transformations to facilitate later association between image features. A gradient-by-ratio method is used for edge detection within individual ISAR images, and edge magnitude and direction are subsequently used to inform a double-weighted Hough transform to detect features with high accuracy. Feature evolution during sequences of frames is analysed. It is shown that the use of feature tracking within sequences with the proposed approach will increase confidence in feature detection and classification, and an example use-case of robust detection of shadowing as a feature is presented.

Motivation: 自动驾驶需要对3D场景进行持续理解，以应对时间干扰并考虑可能的未来动作。作者旨在解决两个任务：响应式预测“接下来会发生什么”和主动式预测“如果执行特定未来动作会发生什么”，并针对现有基准缺乏挑战性场景的问题创建新基准

Conclusion: OccSTeP概念和相应的OccSTeP-WM模型在自动驾驶场景的时空持续性预测任务上表现有效，能够处理挑战性场景并进行在线推理。数据和代码将开源以供社区使用

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires a persistent understanding of 3D scenes that is robust to temporal disturbances and accounts for potential future actions. We introduce a new concept of 4D Occupancy Spatio-Temporal Persistence (OccSTeP), which aims to address two tasks: (1) reactive forecasting: ''what will happen next'' and (2) proactive forecasting: "what would happen given a specific future action". For the first time, we create a new OccSTeP benchmark with challenging scenarios (e.g., erroneous semantic labels and dropped frames). To address this task, we propose OccSTeP-WM, a tokenizer-free world model that maintains a dense voxel-based scene state and incrementally fuses spatio-temporal context over time. OccSTeP-WM leverages a linear-complexity attention backbone and a recurrent state-space module to capture long-range spatial dependencies while continually updating the scene memory with ego-motion compensation. This design enables online inference and robust performance even when historical sensor input is missing or noisy. Extensive experiments prove the effectiveness of the OccSTeP concept and our OccSTeP-WM, yielding an average semantic mIoU of 23.70% (+6.56% gain) and occupancy IoU of 35.89% (+9.26% gain). The data and code will be open source at https://github.com/FaterYU/OccSTeP.

Abstract: We propose \textbf{IC-Effect}, an instruction-guided, DiT-based framework for few-shot video VFX editing that synthesizes complex effects (\eg flames, particles and cartoon characters) while strictly preserving spatial and temporal consistency. Video VFX editing is highly challenging because injected effects must blend seamlessly with the background, the background must remain entirely unchanged, and effect patterns must be learned efficiently from limited paired data. However, existing video editing models fail to satisfy these requirements. IC-Effect leverages the source video as clean contextual conditions, exploiting the contextual learning capability of DiT models to achieve precise background preservation and natural effect injection. A two-stage training strategy, consisting of general editing adaptation followed by effect-specific learning via Effect-LoRA, ensures strong instruction following and robust effect modeling. To further improve efficiency, we introduce spatiotemporal sparse tokenization, enabling high fidelity with substantially reduced computation. We also release a paired VFX editing dataset spanning $15$ high-quality visual styles. Extensive experiments show that IC-Effect delivers high-quality, controllable, and temporally consistent VFX editing, opening new possibilities for video creation.

Abstract: Accurate environment maps are a key component for rendering photorealistic outdoor scenes with coherent illumination. They enable captivating visual arts, immersive virtual reality, and a wide range of engineering and scientific applications. Recent works have extended sky-models to be more comprehensive and inclusive of cloud formations but, as we demonstrate, existing methods fall short in faithfully recreating natural skies. Though in recent years the visual quality of DNN-generated High Dynamic Range Imagery (HDRI) has greatly improved, the environment maps generated by DNN sky-models do not re-light scenes with the same tones, shadows, and illumination as physically captured HDR imagery. In this work, we demonstrate progress in HDR literature to be tangential to sky-modelling as current works cannot support both photorealism and the 22 f-stops required for the Full Dynamic Range (FDR) of outdoor illumination. We achieve this by proposing AllSky, a flexible all-weather sky-model learned directly from physically captured HDRI which we leverage to study the input modalities, tonemapping, conditioning, and evaluation of sky-models. Per user-controlled positioning of the sun and cloud formations, AllSky expands on current functionality by allowing for intuitive user control over environment maps and achieves state-of-the-art sky-model performance. Through our proposed evaluation, we demonstrate existing DNN sky-models are not interchangeable with physically captured HDRI or parametric sky-models, with current limitations being prohibitive of scalability and accurate illumination in downstream applications

TL;DR: 大多数VLMs对经过视觉文本压缩的高密度信息的长期上下文理解能力不足，缺乏对长关联和依赖的有效捕捉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉文本压缩可以有效压缩文本（3x-20x），但高密度信息对VLMs的长上下文理解能力的影响尚未系统研究，因此创建首个VTC基准以填补这一空白。

Method: 提出了首个VTC基准，涵盖三个长上下文理解场景：VTC-Retrieval（检索聚合信息）、VTC-Reasoning（联想词义稀疏的事实）、VTC-Memory（长期对话记忆问答），并建立VTCBench-Wild模拟多种输入场景，对领先的开源和专有模型进行综合评估。

Result: 结果显示，虽然大多数VLMs能较好解码文本信息（如OCR），但对VTC压缩信息的长上下文理解能力较差，未能捕捉上下文中的长关联或依赖。

Conclusion: 研究深入理解了VTC，为设计更高效、可扩展的VLMs提供了基础，也揭示了当前VLMs在处理高密度信息时存在的局限。

Abstract: The computational and memory overheads associated with expanding the context window of LLMs severely limit their scalability. A noteworthy solution is vision-text compression (VTC), exemplified by frameworks like DeepSeek-OCR and Glyph, which convert long texts into dense 2D visual representations, thereby achieving token compression ratios of 3x-20x. However, the impact of this high information density on the core long-context capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) remains under-investigated. To address this gap, we introduce the first benchmark for VTC and systematically assess the performance of VLMs across three long-context understanding settings: VTC-Retrieval, which evaluates the model's ability to retrieve and aggregate information; VTC-Reasoning, which requires models to infer latent associations to locate facts with minimal lexical overlap; and VTC-Memory, which measures comprehensive question answering within long-term dialogue memory. Furthermore, we establish the VTCBench-Wild to simulate diverse input scenarios.We comprehensively evaluate leading open-source and proprietary models on our benchmarks. The results indicate that, despite being able to decode textual information (e.g., OCR) well, most VLMs exhibit a surprisingly poor long-context understanding ability with VTC-compressed information, failing to capture long associations or dependencies in the context.This study provides a deep understanding of VTC and serves as a foundation for designing more efficient and scalable VLMs.

Motivation: 当前前景条件修复方法存在空间关系幻觉问题，包括不适当的前景与背景之间的尺度、位置关系和视角关系。空间合理性的主观性使其难以量化，阻碍了传统基于奖励的RLHF方法的应用。

Method: 提出了InpaintDPO框架：1) MaskDPO将偏好优化限制在背景区域以增强空间关系，同时在前景区域保留修复损失以保持前景一致性；2) 条件非对称偏好优化通过差异化裁剪操作采样样本对并应用全局偏好优化来提升边界一致性；3) 共享共性偏好优化通过提取高质量胜出样本中的共同空间模式来增强模型对空间共性的理解。

Result: 该方法在前景条件修复任务中有效地改善了前景与背景之间的空间合理性，减少了空间关系幻觉的发生。

Conclusion: InpaintDPO框架成功解决了前景条件修复中的空间关系评估难题，通过针对性的偏好优化策略实现了更合理的空间关系生成，为可控图像生成领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Foreground-conditioned inpainting, which aims at generating a harmonious background for a given foreground subject based on the text prompt, is an important subfield in controllable image generation. A common challenge in current methods, however, is the occurrence of Spatial Relationship Hallucinations between the foreground subject and the generated background, including inappropriate scale, positional relationships, and viewpoints. Critically, the subjective nature of spatial rationality makes it challenging to quantify, hindering the use of traditional reward-based RLHF methods. To address this issue, we propose InpaintDPO, the first Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) based framework dedicated to spatial rationality in foreground-conditioned inpainting, ensuring plausible spatial relationships between foreground and background elements. To resolve the gradient conflicts in standard DPO caused by identical foreground in win-lose pairs, we propose MaskDPO, which confines preference optimization exclusively to the background to enhance background spatial relationships, while retaining the inpainting loss in the foreground region for robust foreground preservation. To enhance coherence at the foreground-background boundary, we propose Conditional Asymmetric Preference Optimization, which samples pairs with differentiated cropping operations and applies global preference optimization to promote contextual awareness and enhance boundary coherence. Finally, based on the observation that winning samples share a commonality in plausible spatial relationships, we propose Shared Commonality Preference Optimization to enhance the model's understanding of spatial commonality across high-quality winning samples, further promoting shared spatial rationality.

TL;DR: 论文提出了HALD方法，通过结合硬标签和软标签来校准局部语义漂移，在数据集蒸馏任务中显着提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当每个图像仅使用有限裁剪时，软标签容易出现局部语义漂移：裁剪区域可能在视觉上类似其他类别，导致其软嵌入偏离原始图像的语义。这种局部视觉内容与全局语义含义的不匹配引入了系统误差和训练测试之间的分布不对齐。

Method: 提出了HALD训练范式，利用硬标签作为中间校正信号，同时保留软标签的细粒度优势。通过理论分析表征了在少量软标签监督下漂移的出现，并证明了混合软硬标签可以恢复视觉内容与语义监督之间的对齐。

Result: 在数据集蒸馏和大规模常规分类基准上的广泛实验验证了该方法。在ImageNet-1K上，仅用285M存储就实现了42.7%的性能，比之前的SOTA方法LPLD提升了9.0%。

Conclusion: 研究重新确立了硬标签作为辅助工具的重要性，呼吁在软标签主导的训练中重新思考其作用。

Abstract: Soft labels generated by teacher models have become a dominant paradigm for knowledge transfer and recent large-scale dataset distillation such as SRe2L, RDED, LPLD, offering richer supervision than conventional hard labels. However, we observe that when only a limited number of crops per image are used, soft labels are prone to local semantic drift: a crop may visually resemble another class, causing its soft embedding to deviate from the ground-truth semantics of the original image. This mismatch between local visual content and global semantic meaning introduces systematic errors and distribution misalignment between training and testing. In this work, we revisit the overlooked role of hard labels and show that, when appropriately integrated, they provide a powerful content-agnostic anchor to calibrate semantic drift. We theoretically characterize the emergence of drift under few soft-label supervision and demonstrate that hybridizing soft and hard labels restores alignment between visual content and semantic supervision. Building on this insight, we propose a new training paradigm, Hard Label for Alleviating Local Semantic Drift (HALD), which leverages hard labels as intermediate corrective signals while retaining the fine-grained advantages of soft labels. Extensive experiments on dataset distillation and large-scale conventional classification benchmarks validate our approach, showing consistent improvements in generalization. On ImageNet-1K, we achieve 42.7% with only 285M storage for soft labels, outperforming prior state-of-the-art LPLD by 9.0%. Our findings re-establish the importance of hard labels as a complementary tool, and call for a rethinking of their role in soft-label-dominated training.

Abstract: This paper proposes a training data augmentation pipeline that combines synthetic image data with neural style transfer in order to address the vulnerability of deep vision models to common corruptions. We show that although applying style transfer on synthetic images degrades their quality with respect to the common FID metric, these images are surprisingly beneficial for model training. We conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the effects of both augmentations and their key hyperparameters on the performance of image classifiers. Our results demonstrate that stylization and synthetic data complement each other well and can be combined with popular rule-based data augmentation techniques such as TrivialAugment, while not working with others. Our method achieves state-of-the-art corruption robustness on several small-scale image classification benchmarks, reaching 93.54%, 74.9% and 50.86% robust accuracy on CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C and TinyImageNet-C, respectively

Abstract: The misuse of AI-driven video generation technologies has raised serious social concerns, highlighting the urgent need for reliable AI-generated video detectors. However, most existing methods are limited to binary classification and lack the necessary explanations for human interpretation. In this paper, we present Skyra, a specialized multimodal large language model (MLLM) that identifies human-perceivable visual artifacts in AI-generated videos and leverages them as grounded evidence for both detection and explanation. To support this objective, we construct ViF-CoT-4K for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which represents the first large-scale AI-generated video artifact dataset with fine-grained human annotations. We then develop a two-stage training strategy that systematically enhances our model's spatio-temporal artifact perception, explanation capability, and detection accuracy. To comprehensively evaluate Skyra, we introduce ViF-Bench, a benchmark comprising 3K high-quality samples generated by over ten state-of-the-art video generators. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skyra surpasses existing methods across multiple benchmarks, while our evaluation yields valuable insights for advancing explainable AI-generated video detection.

TL;DR: 介绍了一种名为“重采样强制”的训练方法，用于解决自回归视频扩散模型中的曝光偏差问题，该方法无需教师模型即可实现端到端训练，并引入了历史路由机制以提升长序列生成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归视频扩散模型在预测未来帧时会因训练和推理阶段的不匹配（曝光偏差）而累积错误，现有方法通常依赖双向教师模型或在线判别器，需要后处理，无法实现端到端的训练。

Method: 提出“重采样强制”框架，通过在训练过程中对历史帧进行自重采样以模拟推理阶段的模型误差，并采用稀疏因果掩码来确保时间因果关系；同时引入“历史路由”机制，为每个查询动态检索最相关的历史帧以支持高效的长时程生成。

Result: 实验表明，该方法无需蒸馏即可达到与基准方法相当的性能，并且由于支持原生长度训练，在长视频中表现出更优的时间一致性。

Conclusion: Resampling Forcing为自回归视频扩散模型提供了一种端到端的训练解决方案，显著提升了长时程生成的时间一致性，并避免了依赖教师模型的需求。

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models hold promise for world simulation but are vulnerable to exposure bias arising from the train-test mismatch. While recent works address this via post-training, they typically rely on a bidirectional teacher model or online discriminator. To achieve an end-to-end solution, we introduce Resampling Forcing, a teacher-free framework that enables training autoregressive video models from scratch and at scale. Central to our approach is a self-resampling scheme that simulates inference-time model errors on history frames during training. Conditioned on these degraded histories, a sparse causal mask enforces temporal causality while enabling parallel training with frame-level diffusion loss. To facilitate efficient long-horizon generation, we further introduce history routing, a parameter-free mechanism that dynamically retrieves the top-k most relevant history frames for each query. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves performance comparable to distillation-based baselines while exhibiting superior temporal consistency on longer videos owing to native-length training.

Abstract: Active Speaker Detection (ASD) aims to identify who is currently speaking in each frame of a video. Most state-of-the-art approaches rely on late fusion to combine visual and audio features, but late fusion often fails to capture fine-grained cross-modal interactions, which can be critical for robust performance in unconstrained scenarios. In this paper, we introduce GateFusion, a novel architecture that combines strong pretrained unimodal encoders with a Hierarchical Gated Fusion Decoder (HiGate). HiGate enables progressive, multi-depth fusion by adaptively injecting contextual features from one modality into the other at multiple layers of the Transformer backbone, guided by learnable, bimodally-conditioned gates. To further strengthen multimodal learning, we propose two auxiliary objectives: Masked Alignment Loss (MAL) to align unimodal outputs with multimodal predictions, and Over-Positive Penalty (OPP) to suppress spurious video-only activations. GateFusion establishes new state-of-the-art results on several challenging ASD benchmarks, achieving 77.8% mAP (+9.4%), 86.1% mAP (+2.9%), and 96.1% mAP (+0.5%) on Ego4D-ASD, UniTalk, and WASD benchmarks, respectively, and delivering competitive performance on AVA-ActiveSpeaker. Out-of-domain experiments demonstrate the generalization of our model, while comprehensive ablations show the complementary benefits of each component.

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功将单视角基础模型转化为能够保持跨视角特征一致性的多视角基础模型，为直接处理图像空间中的多视图任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation models are vital tools in various Computer Vision applications. They take as input a single RGB image and output a deep feature representation that is useful for various applications. However, in case we have multiple views of the same 3D scene, they operate on each image independently and do not always produce consistent features for the same 3D point. We propose a way to convert a Foundation Model into a Multi-View Foundation Model. Such a model takes as input a set of images and outputs a feature map for each image such that the features of corresponding points are as consistent as possible. This approach bypasses the need to build a consistent 3D model of the features and allows direct manipulation in the image space. Specifically, we show how to augment Transformers-based foundation models (i.e., DINO, SAM, CLIP) with intermediate 3D-aware attention layers that help match features across different views. As leading examples, we show surface normal estimation and multi-view segmentation tasks. Quantitative experiments show that our method improves feature matching considerably compared to current foundation models.

Abstract: In recent multimodal research, the diffusion paradigm has emerged as a promising alternative to the autoregressive paradigm (AR), owing to its unique decoding advantages. However, due to the capability limitations of the base diffusion language model, the performance of the diffusion vision language model (dVLM) still lags significantly behind that of mainstream models. This leads to a simple yet fundamental question: Is it possible to construct dVLMs based on existing powerful AR models? In response, we propose DiffusionVL, a dVLM family that could be translated from any powerful AR models. Through simple fine-tuning, we successfully adapt AR pre-trained models into the diffusion paradigm. This approach yields two key observations: (1) The paradigm shift from AR-based multimodal models to diffusion is remarkably effective. (2) Direct conversion of an AR language model to a dVLM is also feasible, achieving performance competitive with LLaVA-style visual-instruction-tuning. Further, we introduce a block-decoding design into dVLMs that supports arbitrary-length generation and KV cache reuse, achieving a significant inference speedup. We conduct a large number of experiments. Despite training with less than 5% of the data required by prior methods, DiffusionVL achieves a comprehensive performance improvement-a 34.4% gain on the MMMU-Pro (vision) bench and 37.5% gain on the MME (Cog.) bench-alongside a 2x inference speedup. The model and code are released at https://github.com/hustvl/DiffusionVL.

Abstract: The integration of heavy-duty electric vehicles (EVs) with Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) capability can enhance primary frequency response and improve stability in power systems with high renewable penetration. This study evaluates the technical potential of heavy-duty EV fleets to support the California power grid under three practical charging strategies: immediate charging, delayed charging, and constant-minimum-power charging. We develop a simulation framework that couples aggregated frequency dynamics with battery and charger constraints, state-of-charge management, and fleet-availability profiles. Performance is assessed using standard frequency security metrics, including nadir, rate-of-change-of-frequency, overshoot, and settling time, across credible contingency scenarios and renewable generation conditions. Results indicate that both non-V2G modes and V2G-enabled operation can contribute meaningful primary response, with V2G providing the strongest and fastest support while respecting mobility and network limits. Sensitivity analyses show that the relative benefits depend on charging strategy, control parameters, and renewable output, highlighting design trade-offs between response magnitude, duration, and battery usage. Overall, heavy-duty EV fleets-when coordinated by appropriate charging and V2G controls-offer a viable resource for strengthening primary frequency control on the California grid and mitigating stability challenges associated with increasing renewable penetration.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: I study intertemporal hedging demand in a continuous-time multi-asset long-run risk (LRR) model under Epstein--Zin (EZ) recursive preferences. The investor trades a risk-free asset and several risky assets whose drifts and volatilities depend on an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck type LRR factor. Preferences are described by EZ utility with risk aversion $R$, elasticity of intertemporal substitution $ψ$, and discount rate $δ$, so that the standard time-additive CRRA case appears as a limiting benchmark.
  To handle the high-dimensional consumption--investment problem, I use a projected Pontryagin-guided deep policy optimization (P-PGDPO) scheme adapted to EZ preferences. The method starts from the continuous-time Hamiltonian implied by the Pontryagin maximum principle, represents the value and costate processes with neural networks, and updates the policy along the Hamiltonian gradient. Portfolio constraints and a lower bound on wealth are enforced by explicit projection operators rather than by adding ad hoc penalties.
  Three main findings emerge from numerical experiments in a five-asset LRR economy: \textbf{(1)} the P-PGDPO algorithm achieves stable convergence across multiple random seeds, validating its reliability for solving high-dimensional EZ problems; \textbf{(2)} wealth floors materially reduce hedging demand by limiting the investor's ability to exploit intertemporal risk-return tradeoffs; and \textbf{(3)} the learned hedging portfolios concentrate exposure in assets with high correlation to the LRR factor, confirming that EZ agents actively hedge long-run uncertainty rather than merely following myopic rules. Because EZ preferences nest time-additive CRRA in the limit $ψ\to 1/R$, I use CRRA as an explicit diagnostic benchmark and, when needed, a warm start to stabilize training in high dimensions.

Abstract: Electromagnetic navigation systems (eMNS) are increasingly used in minimally invasive procedures such as endovascular interventions and targeted drug delivery due to their ability to generate fast and precise magnetic fields. In this paper, we utilize the OctoMag eMNS to achieve remote levitation and control of a rigid body across large air gaps which showcases the dynamic capabilities of clinical eMNS. A compact parametric analytical model maps coil currents to the forces and torques acting on the levitating object, eliminating the need for computationally expensive simulations or lookup tables and leading to a levitator agnostic modeling approach. Translational motion is stabilized using linear quadratic regulators. A nonlinear time-invariant controller is used to regulate the reduced attitude accounting for the inherent uncontrollability of rotations about the dipole axis and stabilizing the full five degrees of freedom controllable pose subspace. We analyze key design limitations and evaluate the approach through trajectory tracking experiments. This work demonstrates the dynamic capabilities and potential of feedback control in electromagnetic navigation, which is likely to open up new medical applications.

Abstract: This work proposes a cooperative strategy for a group of quadrotors interacting over ring digraphs with macro-vertices of size two. Consensus for a group of general double integrators has been initially investigated, and it has been proved that through a suitable choice of a single controller parameter, consensus and stability of the resulting networked dynamical system can be ensured. This further opens up the possibility of achieving a desired formation and to move a swarm of quadrotors, interacting over ring digraphs, at a desired flight velocity, using a single controller gain. An analysis of achievable velocities is performed. Examples have been provided to offer deeper insights into the obtained analytical results. Simulation studies clearly demonstrate that a desired formation is achieved, starting from arbitrary initial positions, while also ensuring convergence to a final desired flight velocity.

Abstract: We present a sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) method that implements Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) as an \emph{Ising machine}, suitable for novel forms of probabilistic computing. By expressing the control problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, we map MPC onto an energy landscape suitable for Gibbs sampling from an Ising model. This formulation enables efficient exploration of (near-)optimal control trajectories. We demonstrate that the approach achieves accurate trajectory tracking compared to a reference MPPI implementation, highlighting the potential of Ising-based MPPI for real-time control in robotics and autonomous systems.

Abstract: The increasing electrification of human activities and the rapid integration of variable renewable energy sources strain the power grid. A solution to address the need for more grid storage is to use the battery of electric vehicles as a back-up capacity. However, drivers tend to disconnect their electric vehicle when its battery is needed the most. We propose a charge scheduler that incentivizes drivers to delay their disconnection to improve vehicle-to-grid services. We also leverage drivers' temporal flexibility to alleviate congestion in oversubscribed charging stations. We formulate the computation of an optimal flexible schedule as a mixed-integer quadratic problem. We tractably approximate its solution using the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers. Considering the possibility that strategic drivers misreport their charging preferences to the station coordinator, we then propose a Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism that incentivizes truthful reporting. We conclude with a simulated case study using real-world data to quantitatively assess the added value of drivers' temporal flexibility for enhancing vehicle-to-grid services and reducing station congestion.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of a battery's state of charge and state of health is essential for safe and reliable battery management. Existing approaches often decouple these two states, lack stability guarantees, and exhibit limited generalization across operating conditions. This study introduces a unified operator-theoretic framework for aging-aware state of charge and control-informed state of health estimation. The architecture couples a Koopman-based latent dynamics model, which enables linear forecasting of nonlinear discharge-capacity evolution under varying operational conditions, with a neural operator that maps measurable intra-cycle signals to state of charge. The predicted discharge capacity is incorporated as a static correction within the neural operator pathway, yielding an age-aware state of charge estimate. Stability is ensured through spectral-radius clipping of the Koopman operator. The overall framework is trained end-to-end and evaluated on real-world lithium-ion battery datasets, demonstrating real-time capability while maintaining stable dynamics. To handle condition shifts and unseen regimes, the method integrates both zero-shot and few-shot out-of-distribution adaptation using only a limited number of cycles. Results show accurate and stable capacity forecasts, competitive state of charge trajectories on held-out cycles, and a direct, model-consistent mechanism for tracking capacity fade as a surrogate for state of health across diverse operating conditions.

Abstract: The industrial production of microalgae is an important and sustainable process, but its actual competitiveness is closely related to its optimization. The biological nature of the process hinders this task, mainly due to the high nonlinearity of the process along with its changing nature, features that make its modeling, control and optimization remarkably challenging. This paper presents an economic optimization framework aiming to enhance the operation of such systems. An Economic Model Predictive Controller is proposed, centralizing the decision making and achieving the theoretical optimal operation. Different scenarios with changing climate conditions are presented, and a comparison with the typical, non-optimized industrial process operation is established. The obtained results achieve economic optimization and dynamic stability of the process, while providing some insight into the priorities during process operation at industrial level, and justifying the use of optimal controllers over traditional operation.

Main category: eess.SY

TL;DR: 本文针对高比例逆变电源导致的电网惯量下降和频率稳定问题，提出了面向服务的柔性负荷与储能快速频率响应协调框架，弥合了物理能力评估与电网调度的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着可再生能源渗透率的提高，电力系统惯量显著降低，电网对扰动后的快速频率变化更为敏感。虽然电动汽车、数据中心、电池储能等多种灵活资源具备快速频率响应能力，但现有研究多关注单一资源性能或控制器设计，缺乏将异构资源能力转化为可部署系统级服务的系统框架。

Method: 本文提出服务导向的协调框架，根据响应速度、功率容量和能量可持续性将频率支撑分解为多个时间关键的服务层，并据此动态分配异构资源的FFR责任。通过显式考虑响应延迟、饱和限制和能量约束，实现协调调度，优先使用超快资源进行初始频率抑制，同时利用较慢但能量丰富的资源维持恢复。

Result: 该框架能够将异构FFR能力转化为可部署的系统级频率服务，实现快速响应资源与高能量资源的协调配合，提高电力系统的频率稳定性和恢复能力。

Conclusion: 提出的服务导向协调框架为电力系统中灵活负荷和储能提供快速频率响应提供了系统性解决方案，填补了物理能力评估与电网运行应用之间的空白，提升了异构资源在频率稳定服务中的协同效率。

Abstract: The increasing penetration of inverter-based renewable generation has significantly reduced system inertia, making modern power grids more vulnerable to rapid frequency deviations following disturbances. While a wide range of flexible resources-including electric vehicles (EVs), data centers, and battery energy storage systems (BESS)-have demonstrated the physical capability to provide fast frequency response (FFR), existing studies primarily focus on individual resource performance or controller-level designs. A systematic framework that translates heterogeneous FFR capabilities into deployable, system-level frequency services remains largely unexplored. This paper proposes a service-oriented coordination framework for fast frequency response from flexible loads and energy storage, bridging the gap between physical capability assessment and grid-operational utilization. The framework decomposes frequency support into multiple time-critical service layers based on response speed, power capacity, and energy sustainability, and dynamically allocates FFR responsibilities among heterogeneous resources accordingly. By explicitly accounting for response latency, saturation limits, and energy constraints, the proposed approach enables coordinated dispatch that prioritizes ultra-fast resources for initial frequency arrest while leveraging slower but energy-rich resources to sustain recovery.

Abstract: Transformer-based language models display impressive reasoning-like behavior, yet remain brittle on tasks that require stable symbolic manipulation. This paper develops a unified perspective on these phenomena by interpreting self-attention and residual streams as implementing an approximate Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA). In this view, queries and keys define role spaces, values encode fillers, attention weights perform soft unbinding, and residual connections realize superposition of many bound structures. We use this algebraic lens to relate transformer internals to chain-of-thought traces, program-based reasoning, and memory-augmented tool use, and to explain characteristic failure modes such as variable confusion and inconsistency across logically related prompts. Building on this perspective, we propose VSA-inspired architectural biases, including explicit binding/unbinding heads and hyperdimensional memory layers, and training objectives that promote role-filler separation and robust superposition. Finally, we outline metrics for measuring "VSA-likeness" and logical compositionality, and pose theoretical and architectural open problems. Overall, the paper argues that viewing attention as soft vector-symbolic computation offers a principled route toward more interpretable and logically reliable reasoning systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong results on knowledge graph question answering (KGQA), but most benchmarks assume complete knowledge graphs (KGs) where direct supporting triples exist. This reduces evaluation to shallow retrieval and overlooks the reality of incomplete KGs, where many facts are missing and answers must be inferred from existing facts. We bridge this gap by proposing a methodology for constructing benchmarks under KG incompleteness, which removes direct supporting triples while ensuring that alternative reasoning paths required to infer the answer remain. Experiments on benchmarks constructed using our methodology show that existing methods suffer consistent performance degradation under incompleteness, highlighting their limited reasoning ability. To overcome this limitation, we present the Adaptive Graph Reasoning Agent (GR-Agent). It first constructs an interactive environment from the KG, and then formalizes KGQA as agent environment interaction within this environment. GR-Agent operates over an action space comprising graph reasoning tools and maintains a memory of potential supporting reasoning evidence, including relevant relations and reasoning paths. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GR-Agent outperforms non-training baselines and performs comparably to training-based methods under both complete and incomplete settings.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) currently exhibit low success rates in generating correct and intent-aligned Infrastructure as Code (IaC). This research investigated methods to improve LLM-based IaC generation, specifically for Terraform, by systematically injecting structured configuration knowledge. To facilitate this, an existing IaC-Eval benchmark was significantly enhanced with cloud emulation and automated error analysis. Additionally, a novel error taxonomy for LLM-assisted IaC code generation was developed. A series of knowledge injection techniques was implemented and evaluated, progressing from Naive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to more sophisticated Graph RAG approaches. These included semantic enrichment of graph components and modeling inter-resource dependencies. Experimental results demonstrated that while baseline LLM performance was poor (27.1% overall success), injecting structured configuration knowledge increased technical validation success to 75.3% and overall success to 62.6%. Despite these gains in technical correctness, intent alignment plateaued, revealing a "Correctness-Congruence Gap" where LLMs can become proficient "coders" but remain limited "architects" in fulfilling nuanced user intent.

Abstract: Agricultural regions in rural areas face damage from climate-related risks, including droughts, heavy rainfall, and shifting weather patterns. Prior research calls for adaptive risk-management solutions and decision-making strategies. To this end, artificial intelligence (AI), particularly agentic AI, offers a promising path forward. Agentic AI systems consist of autonomous, specialized agents capable of solving complex, dynamic tasks. While past systems have relied on single-agent models or have used multi-agent frameworks only for static functions, there is a growing need for architectures that support dynamic collaborative reasoning and context-aware outputs. To bridge this gap, we present AgroAskAI, a multi-agent reasoning system for climate adaptation decision support in agriculture, with a focus on vulnerable rural communities. AgroAskAI features a modular, role-specialized architecture that uses a chain-of-responsibility approach to coordinate autonomous agents, integrating real-time tools and datasets. The system has built-in governance mechanisms that mitigate hallucination and enable internal feedback for coherent, locally relevant strategies. The system also supports multilingual interactions, making it accessible to non-English-speaking farmers. Experiments on common agricultural queries related to climate adaptation show that, with additional tools and prompt refinement, AgroAskAI delivers more actionable, grounded, and inclusive outputs. Our experimental results highlight the potential of agentic AI for sustainable and accountable decision support in climate adaptation for agriculture.

Abstract: The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) in complex reasoning domains typically relies on performance alignment with ground-truth oracles. In the domain of chess, this standard manifests as accuracy benchmarks against strong engines like Stockfish. However, high scalar accuracy does not necessarily imply robust conceptual understanding. This paper argues that standard accuracy metrics fail to distinguish between genuine geometric reasoning and the superficial memorization of canonical board states. To address this gap, we propose a Geometric Stability Framework, a novel evaluation methodology that rigorously tests model consistency under invariant transformations-including board rotation, mirror symmetry, color inversion, and format conversion. We applied this framework to a comparative analysis of six state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-5.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5, and Kimi K2 Turbo, utilizing a dataset of approximately 3,000 positions. Our results reveal a significant Accuracy-Stability Paradox. While models such as GPT-5.1 achieve near-optimal accuracy on standard positions, they exhibit catastrophic degradation under geometric perturbation, specifically in rotation tasks where error rates surge by over 600%. This disparity suggests a reliance on pattern matching over abstract spatial logic. Conversely, Claude Sonnet 4.5 and Kimi K2 Turbo demonstrate superior dual robustness, maintaining high consistency across all transformation axes. Furthermore, we analyze the trade-off between helpfulness and safety, identifying Gemini 2.5 Flash as the leader in illegal state rejection (96.0%). We conclude that geometric stability provides an orthogonal and essential metric for AI evaluation, offering a necessary proxy for disentangling reasoning capabilities from data contamination and overfitting in large-scale models.

Abstract: End-to-end paradigms have demonstrated great potential for autonomous driving. Additionally, most existing methods are built upon Transformer architectures. However, transformers incur a quadratic attention cost, limiting their ability to model long spatial and temporal sequences-particularly on resource-constrained edge platforms. As autonomous driving inherently demands efficient temporal modeling, this challenge severely limits their deployment and real-time performance. Recently, linear attention mechanisms have gained increasing attention due to their superior spatiotemporal complexity. However, existing linear attention architectures are limited to self-attention, lacking support for cross-modal and cross-temporal interactions-both crucial for autonomous driving. In this work, we propose LADY, the first fully linear attention-based generative model for end-to-end autonomous driving. LADY enables fusion of long-range temporal context at inference with constant computational and memory costs, regardless of the history length of camera and LiDAR features. Additionally, we introduce a lightweight linear cross-attention mechanism that enables effective cross-modal information exchange. Experiments on the NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks demonstrate that LADY achieves state-of-the-art performance with constant-time and memory complexity, offering improved planning performance and significantly reduced computational cost. Additionally, the model has been deployed and validated on edge devices, demonstrating its practicality in resource-limited scenarios.

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a key development direction in the sixth-generation (6G) era, which provides essential support for the collaborative sensing and communication of future intelligent networks. However, as wireless environments become increasingly dynamic and complex, ISAC systems require more intelligent processing and more autonomous operation to maintain efficiency and adaptability. Meanwhile, agentic artificial intelligence (AI) offers a feasible solution to address these challenges by enabling continuous perception-reasoning-action loops in dynamic environments to support intelligent, autonomous, and efficient operation for ISAC systems. As such, we delve into the application value and prospects of agentic AI in ISAC systems in this work. Firstly, we provide a comprehensive review of agentic AI and ISAC systems to demonstrate their key characteristics. Secondly, we show several common optimization approaches for ISAC systems and highlight the significant advantages of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI)-based agentic AI. Thirdly, we propose a novel agentic ISAC framework and prensent a case study to verify its superiority in optimizing ISAC performance. Finally, we clarify future research directions for agentic AI-based ISAC systems.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various language tasks. However, existing LLM reasoning strategies mainly rely on the LLM itself with fast or slow mode (like o1 thinking) and thus struggle to balance reasoning efficiency and accuracy across queries of varying difficulties. In this paper, we propose Cognitive-Inspired Elastic Reasoning (CogER), a framework inspired by human hierarchical reasoning that dynamically selects the most suitable reasoning strategy for each query. Specifically, CogER first assesses the complexity of incoming queries and assigns them to one of several predefined levels, each corresponding to a tailored processing strategy, thereby addressing the challenge of unobservable query difficulty. To achieve automatic strategy selection, we model the process as a Markov Decision Process and train a CogER-Agent using reinforcement learning. The agent is guided by a reward function that balances solution quality and computational cost, ensuring resource-efficient reasoning. Moreover, for queries requiring external tools, we introduce Cognitive Tool-Assisted Reasoning, which enables the LLM to autonomously invoke external tools within its chain-of-thought. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CogER outperforms state-of-the-art Test-Time scaling methods, achieving at least a 13% relative improvement in average exact match on In-Domain tasks and an 8% relative gain on Out-of-Domain tasks.

Abstract: Efficient exact algorithms for Discrete Optimization (DO) rely heavily on strong primal and dual bounds. Relaxed Decision Diagrams (DDs) provide a versatile mechanism for deriving such dual bounds by compactly over-approximating the solution space through node merging. However, the quality of these relaxed diagrams, i.e. the tightness of the resulting dual bounds, depends critically on the variable ordering and the merging decisions executed during compilation. While dynamic variable ordering heuristics effectively tighten bounds, they often incur computational overhead when evaluated globally across the entire variable set. To mitigate this trade-off, this work introduces a novel clustering-based framework for variable ordering. Instead of applying dynamic ordering heuristics to the full set of unfixed variables, we first partition variables into clusters. We then leverage this structural decomposition to guide the ordering process, significantly reducing the heuristic's search space. Within this framework, we investigate two distinct strategies: Cluster-to-Cluster, which processes clusters sequentially using problem-specific aggregate criteria (such as cumulative vertex weights in the Maximum Weighted Independent Set Problem (MWISP)), and Pick-and-Sort, which iteratively selects and sorts representative variables from each cluster to balance local diversity with heuristic guidance. Later on, developing some theoretical results on the growth of the size of DDs for MWISP we propose two different policies for setting the number of clusters within the proposed framework. We embed these strategies into a DD-based branch-and-bound algorithm and evaluate them on the MWISP. Across benchmark instances, the proposed methodology consistently reduces computational costs compared to standard dynamic variable ordering baseline.

Abstract: The automated and intelligent processing of massive remote sensing (RS) datasets is critical in Earth observation (EO). Existing automated systems are normally task-specific, lacking a unified framework to manage diverse, end-to-end workflows--from data preprocessing to advanced interpretation--across diverse RS applications. To address this gap, this paper introduces CangLing-KnowFlow, a unified intelligent agent framework that integrates a Procedural Knowledge Base (PKB), Dynamic Workflow Adjustment, and an Evolutionary Memory Module. The PKB, comprising 1,008 expert-validated workflow cases across 162 practical RS tasks, guides planning and substantially reduces hallucinations common in general-purpose agents. During runtime failures, the Dynamic Workflow Adjustment autonomously diagnoses and replans recovery strategies, while the Evolutionary Memory Module continuously learns from these events, iteratively enhancing the agent's knowledge and performance. This synergy enables CangLing-KnowFlow to adapt, learn, and operate reliably across diverse, complex tasks. We evaluated CangLing-KnowFlow on the KnowFlow-Bench, a novel benchmark of 324 workflows inspired by real-world applications, testing its performance across 13 top Large Language Model (LLM) backbones, from open-source to commercial. Across all complex tasks, CangLing-KnowFlow surpassed the Reflexion baseline by at least 4% in Task Success Rate. As the first most comprehensive validation along this emerging field, this research demonstrates the great potential of CangLing-KnowFlow as a robust, efficient, and scalable automated solution for complex EO challenges by leveraging expert knowledge (Knowledge) into adaptive and verifiable procedures (Flow).

Abstract: Controller synthesis is a formal method approach for automatically generating Labeled Transition System (LTS) controllers that satisfy specified properties. The efficiency of the synthesis process, however, is critically dependent on exploration policies. These policies often rely on fixed rules or strategies learned through reinforcement learning (RL) that consider only a limited set of current features. To address this limitation, this paper introduces GCRL, an approach that enhances RL-based methods by integrating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GCRL encodes the history of LTS exploration into a graph structure, allowing it to capture a broader, non-current-based context. In a comparative experiment against state-of-the-art methods, GCRL exhibited superior learning efficiency and generalization across four out of five benchmark domains, except one particular domain characterized by high symmetry and strictly local interactions.

Abstract: The rapid development of Generative AI is bringing innovative changes to education and assessment. As the prevalence of students utilizing AI for assignments increases, concerns regarding academic integrity and the validity of assessments are growing. This study utilizes the Earth Science I section of the 2025 Korean College Scholastic Ability Test (CSAT) to deeply analyze the multimodal scientific reasoning capabilities and cognitive limitations of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. Three experimental conditions (full-page input, individual item input, and optimized multimodal input) were designed to evaluate model performance across different data structures. Quantitative results indicated that unstructured inputs led to significant performance degradation due to segmentation and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) failures. Even under optimized conditions, models exhibited fundamental reasoning flaws. Qualitative analysis revealed that "Perception Errors" were dominant, highlighting a "Perception-Cognition Gap" where models failed to interpret symbolic meanings in schematic diagrams despite recognizing visual data. Furthermore, models demonstrated a "Calculation-Conceptualization Discrepancy," successfully performing calculations while failing to apply the underlying scientific concepts, and "Process Hallucination," where models skipped visual verification in favor of plausible but unfounded background knowledge. Addressing the challenge of unauthorized AI use in coursework, this study provides actionable cues for designing "AI-resistant questions" that target these specific cognitive vulnerabilities. By exploiting AI's weaknesses, such as the gap between perception and cognition, educators can distinguish genuine student competency from AI-generated responses, thereby ensuring assessment fairness.

Abstract: In multi-player card games such as Skat or Bridge, the early stages of the game, such as bidding, game selection, and initial card selection, are often more critical to the success of the play than refined middle- and end-game play. At the current limits of computation, such early decision-making resorts to using statistical information derived from a large corpus of human expert games. In this paper, we derive and evaluate a general bootstrapping outer-learning framework that improves prediction accuracy by expanding the database of human games with millions of self-playing AI games to generate and merge statistics. We implement perfect feature hash functions to address compacted tables, producing a self-improving card game engine, where newly inferred knowledge is continuously improved during self-learning. The case study in Skat shows that the automated approach can be used to support various decisions in the game.

Abstract: Due to the restricted resources, efficient scheduling in vertiports has received much more attention in the field of Urban Air Mobility (UAM). For the scheduling problem, we utilize a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP), which is often formulated in a resource-restricted project scheduling problem (RCPSP). In this paper, we show our approach to handle both dynamic operation requirements and vague rescheduling requests from humans. Particularly, we utilize a three-valued logic for interpreting ambiguous user intents and a decision tree, proposing a newly integrated system that combines Answer Set Programming (ASP) and MILP. This integrated framework optimizes schedules and supports human inputs transparently. With this system, we provide a robust structure for explainable, adaptive UAM scheduling.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于场景的科学发现评估（SDE）框架，评估大语言模型在多学科科学发现项目中的性能，发现模型在科学发现任务上存在系统性弱点，且规模扩大带来的收益递减。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的科学基准测试大多评估去上下文知识，忽视了驱动科学发现的迭代推理、假设生成和观测解释过程，需要更贴近真实科学研究过程的评估方法。

Method: 引入情景化基准测试，由领域专家定义真实研究项目并将其分解为模块化研究场景，从中采样验证问题；采用项目级和问题级两级评估：项目级要求模型提出可检验假设、设计实验和解释结果，问题级评估场景相关项目的准确性。

Result: 应用SDE框架评估最先进LLMs发现：相对于一般科学基准存在一致性能差距；模型规模和推理能力扩展带来的收益递减；不同提供商顶级模型共享系统性弱点；研究场景间性能差异大，导致最佳模型选择随项目变化。

Conclusion: 所有当前LLMs距离通用科学“超级智能”还很远，但已显示出在多种科学发现项目中的潜力；SDE框架为LLMs的科学发现相关评估提供了可复现的基准，并指明了推动其朝向科学发现发展的实用路径。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to scientific research, yet prevailing science benchmarks probe decontextualized knowledge and overlook the iterative reasoning, hypothesis generation, and observation interpretation that drive scientific discovery. We introduce a scenario-grounded benchmark that evaluates LLMs across biology, chemistry, materials, and physics, where domain experts define research projects of genuine interest and decompose them into modular research scenarios from which vetted questions are sampled. The framework assesses models at two levels: (i) question-level accuracy on scenario-tied items and (ii) project-level performance, where models must propose testable hypotheses, design simulations or experiments, and interpret results. Applying this two-phase scientific discovery evaluation (SDE) framework to state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a consistent performance gap relative to general science benchmarks, diminishing return of scaling up model sizes and reasoning, and systematic weaknesses shared across top-tier models from different providers. Large performance variation in research scenarios leads to changing choices of the best performing model on scientific discovery projects evaluated, suggesting all current LLMs are distant to general scientific "superintelligence". Nevertheless, LLMs already demonstrate promise in a great variety of scientific discovery projects, including cases where constituent scenario scores are low, highlighting the role of guided exploration and serendipity in discovery. This SDE framework offers a reproducible benchmark for discovery-relevant evaluation of LLMs and charts practical paths to advance their development toward scientific discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有价值对齐文献较少关注如何确定在不确定情况下，何时非完美对齐已足够合理以证明委托决策的正当性。需要系统分析理性委托所需权衡的因素。

Method: 提出正式决策理论框架，精确考虑委托者对AI价值对齐、认知准确性和行动范围的不确定性。开发新颖的评分框架来量化事前决策。

Result: 分析揭示了两种委托情景的根本区别：通用委托需要近乎完美的价值对齐和完全认知信任；而特定情境委托即使存在显著不对齐也可能是最优的，只要AI的更高准确性或更广泛行动范围能带来更好的整体决策问题。

Conclusion: 本研究提供了确定AI在特定情境下是否足够对齐的规范方法，将重点从追求完美对齐转向在不确定性下管理委托的风险和收益。

Abstract: When should we delegate decisions to AI systems? While the value alignment literature has developed techniques for shaping AI values, less attention has been paid to how to determine, under uncertainty, when imperfect alignment is good enough to justify delegation. We argue that rational delegation requires balancing an agent's value (mis)alignment with its epistemic accuracy and its reach (the acts it has available). This paper introduces a formal, decision-theoretic framework to analyze this tradeoff precisely accounting for a principal's uncertainty about these factors. Our analysis reveals a sharp distinction between two delegation scenarios. First, universal delegation (trusting an agent with any problem) demands near-perfect value alignment and total epistemic trust, conditions rarely met in practice. Second, we show that context-specific delegation can be optimal even with significant misalignment. An agent's superior accuracy or expanded reach may grant access to better overall decision problems, making delegation rational in expectation. We develop a novel scoring framework to quantify this ex ante decision. Ultimately, our work provides a principled method for determining when an AI is aligned enough for a given context, shifting the focus from achieving perfect alignment to managing the risks and rewards of delegation under uncertainty.

Abstract: Human beings solve complex problems through critical thinking, where reasoning and evaluation are intertwined to converge toward correct solutions. However, most existing large language models (LLMs) decouple reasoning from verification: they either generate reasoning without explicit self-checking or rely on external verifiers to detect errors post hoc. The former lacks immediate feedback, while the latter increases system complexity and hinders synchronized learning. Motivated by human critical thinking, we propose Stepwise Think-Critique (STC), a unified framework that interleaves reasoning and self-critique at each step within a single model. STC is trained with a hybrid reinforcement learning objective combining reasoning rewards and critique-consistency rewards to jointly optimize reasoning quality and self-evaluation. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that STC demonstrates strong critic-thinking capabilities and produces more interpretable reasoning traces, representing a step toward LLMs with built-in critical thinking.

Motivation: 现有上下文归因方法在解释自回归大语言模型时存在局限，它们直接将生成token与提示关联，忽略了代际间的影响，导致解释不完整。

Method: 提出Context Attribution via Graph Explanations (CAGE)框架，构建有向属性图量化提示和所有先前生成对每个生成的影响；该图保持因果关系和行随机性，通过沿图路径边缘化中间贡献来计算上下文归因。

Result: 在多模型、数据集、指标和方法上的实验表明，CAGE显著提升了上下文归因的忠实度，平均增益最高达40%。

Conclusion: CAGE框架通过建模代际依赖关系，提供了更完整、更忠实的LLM行为解释，有助于提高模型透明度、安全性和可信度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities, yet their reasoning remains opaque, raising safety and trust concerns. Attribution methods, which assign credit to input features, have proven effective for explaining the decision making of computer vision models. From these, context attributions have emerged as a promising approach for explaining the behavior of autoregressive LLMs. However, current context attributions produce incomplete explanations by directly relating generated tokens to the prompt, discarding inter-generational influence in the process. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce the Context Attribution via Graph Explanations (CAGE) framework. CAGE introduces an attribution graph: a directed graph that quantifies how each generation is influenced by both the prompt and all prior generations. The graph is constructed to preserve two properties-causality and row stochasticity. The attribution graph allows context attributions to be computed by marginalizing intermediate contributions along paths in the graph. Across multiple models, datasets, metrics, and methods, CAGE improves context attribution faithfulness, achieving average gains of up to 40%.

Abstract: This paper proposes a dual-engine AI architectural method designed to address the complex problem of exploring potential trajectories in the evolution of art. We present two interconnected components: AIDA (an artificial artist social network) and the Ismism Machine, a system for critical analysis. The core innovation lies in leveraging deep learning and multi-agent collaboration to enable multidimensional simulations of art historical developments and conceptual innovation patterns. The framework explores a shift from traditional unidirectional critique toward an intelligent, interactive mode of reflexive practice. We are currently applying this method in experimental studies on contemporary art concepts. This study introduces a general methodology based on AI-driven critical loops, offering new possibilities for computational analysis of art.

Abstract: Driven by massive investments and consequently significant progresses in optical computing and all-optical signal processing technologies lately, this paper presents a new architectural paradigm for next-generation optical transport network, entitled \textit{optical computing-communication integrated network}, which is capable of providing dual services at the optical layer, namely, computing and communication. This approach seeks to exploit the potential for performing optical computing operations among lightpaths that traverse the same intermediate node. \textit{Optical-layer intelligence concept} is thus introduced as the capability to perform computing / processing at the lightpath scale to achieve greater spectral and/or computing efficiency. A case study focusing on optical aggregation operation is introduced, highlighting the key differences between optical computing-communication integrated network and its current counterpart, optical-bypass ones. A mathematical formulation for optimal designs of optical-aggregation-enabled network is then provided and performance comparison with traditional optical-bypass model is drawn on the realistic NSFNET topology.

Abstract: Semantic communication addresses the limitations of the Shannon paradigm by focusing on transmitting meaning rather than exact representations, thereby reducing unnecessary resource consumption. This is particularly beneficial for video, which dominates network traffic and demands high bandwidth and power, making semantic approaches ideal for conserving resources while maintaining quality. In this paper, we propose a Predictability-aware and Entropy-adaptive Neural Motion Estimation (PENME) method to address challenges related to high latency, high bitrate, and power consumption in video transmission. PENME makes per-frame decisions to select a residual motion extraction model, convolutional neural network, vision transformer, or optical flow, using a five-step policy based on motion strength, global motion consistency, peak sharpness, heterogeneity, and residual error. The residual motions are then transmitted to the receiver, where the frames are reconstructed via motion-compensated updates. Next, a selective diffusion-based refinement, the Latent Consistency Model (LCM-4), is applied on frames that trigger refinement due to low predictability or large residuals, while predictable frames skip refinement. PENME also allocates radio resource blocks with awareness of residual motion and channel state, reducing power consumption and bandwidth usage while maintaining high semantic similarity. Our simulation results on the Vimeo90K dataset demonstrate that the proposed PENME method handles various types of video, outperforming traditional communication, hybrid, and adaptive bitrate semantic communication techniques, achieving 40% lower latency, 90% less transmitted data, and 35% higher throughput. For semantic communication metrics, PENME improves PSNR by about 40%, increases MS-SSIM by roughly 19%, and reduces LPIPS by nearly 35%, compared with the baseline methods.

Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) has been considered as a promising waveform to enable high-reliable connectivity in the internet of vehicles. However, accurate channel estimation is critical and challenging to achieve the expected performance of the AFDM systems in doubly-dispersive channels. In this paper, we propose a sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework for AFDM systems and develop a dynamic grid update strategy with two off-grid channel estimation methods, i.e., grid-refinement SBL (GR-SBL) and grid-evolution SBL (GE-SBL) estimators. Specifically, the GR-SBL employs a localized grid refinement method and dynamically updates grid for a high-precision estimation. The GE-SBL estimator approximates the off-grid components via first-order linear approximation and enables gradual grid evolution for estimation accuracy enhancement. Furthermore, we develop a distributed computing scheme to decompose the large-dimensional channel estimation model into multiple manageable small-dimensional sub-models for complexity reduction of GR-SBL and GE-SBL, denoted as distributed GR-SBL (D-GR-SBL) and distributed GE-SBL (D-GE-SBL) estimators, which also support parallel processing to reduce the computational latency. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed channel estimators outperform existing competitive schemes. The GR-SBL estimator achieves high-precision estimation with fine step sizes at the cost of high complexity, while the GE-SBL estimator provides a better trade-off between performance and complexity. The proposed D-GR-SBL and D-GE-SBL estimators effectively reduce complexity and maintain comparable performance to GR-SBL and GE-SBL estimators, respectively.

Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and movable antenna (MA) are promising technologies to enhance wireless communication by reconfiguring channels at the environment and transceiver sides. However, their performance is constrained by practical limitations. To address this, we propose a multi-functional antenna/surface system that leverages their complementary advantages. A rotatable IRS (R-IRS) is deployed to enhance downlink communications from a six-dimensional MA (6DMA)-equipped base station (BS) to multiple single-antenna users. To reduce the complexity of real-time channel estimation and beamforming, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the average sum-rate using a two-timescale (TTS) transmission protocol. Specifically, the BS antenna configuration (including position and rotation) and IRS rotation and reflection are optimized based on statistical channel state information (S-CSI), while BS transmit beamforming is designed using instantaneous CSI (I-CSI) in the short timescale. We first consider a single-user case and show that the 6DMA at the BS should form a sparse array for multi-beam transmission towards both the IRS and the user, allowing efficient coordination of direct and reflected channels, while the IRS rotation achieves effective multi-path alignment. For the general multi-user case, the optimization problem is non-convex and challenging to solve. To tackle this, we propose an efficient algorithm combining weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE) and stochastic successive convex approximation (SSCA) techniques. A low-complexity algorithm is also proposed to reduce computational complexity. Numerical results validate the proposed system, showing significant performance gains by jointly exploiting the spatial degrees of freedom of the 6DMA-BS and R-IRS under the TTS protocol.

Abstract: We study sparse principal component analysis in the high-dimensional, sample-limited regime, aiming to recover a leading component supported on a few coordinates. Despite extensive progress, most methods and analyses are tailored to the flat-spike case, offering little guidance when spike energy is unevenly distributed across the support. Motivated by this, we propose Spectral Energy Pursuit (SEP), an effective iterative scheme that repeatedly screens and reselects coordinates, with a sample complexity that adapts to the energy profile. We develop our framework around a structure function \(s(p)\) that quantifies how spike energy accumulates over its top \(p\) entries. We establish that SEP succeeds with a sample size of order \(\max_{1\le p\le k} p\,s^2(p)\,\log n\), which matches the classical \(k^2\log n\) sample complexity for flat spikes and improves toward the \(k\log n\) regime as the profile becomes more concentrated. As a lightweight post-processing, a single truncated power iteration is proven to enable the final estimator to attain a uniform statistical error bound. Empirical simulations across flat, power-law, and exponential signals validate that SEP adapts to profile structure without tuning and outperforms existing algorithms.

Abstract: The fluid antenna system (FAS) refers to a family of reconfigurable antenna technologies that provide substantial spatial gains within a compact, predefined small space, thereby offering extensive degrees of freedom in the physical layer for future communication networks. The acquisition of channel state information (CSI) is critical, as it determines the placement of ports/antennas, which directly impacts FAS-based optimization. Although various channel estimation methods have been developed, significant flaws persist. For instance, the performance of greedy-based algorithms is heavily influenced by signal assumptions, and current model-free methods are infeasible due to prohibitively high computational complexity issue. Consequently, there is a pressing need for a well-balanced solution that exhibits flexibility, feasibility, and low complexity to support massive connectivity in FAS. In this work, we propose methods based on approximate message passing (AMP) integrated with adaptive expectation maximization (EM). The EM-AMP framework uniquely enables efficient large matrix computations with adaptive learning capabilities, independent of prior knowledge of the model or parameters within potential distributions, making it a robust candidate for FAS networks. We introduce two variants of the EM-AMP framework that leverage geographical and angular features in a FAS network. These proposed algorithms demonstrate improved estimation precision, fast convergence, and low computational complexity in large activity regions. Additionally, we analytically elucidate the reasons behind the inherent performance floor of greedy-based methods and highlight the critical role of angular information in algorithm design. Extensive numerical results validate the promising efficacy of the proposed algorithm designs and the derived analytical findings.

Abstract: Channel charting creates a low-dimensional representation of the radio environment in a self-supervised manner using manifold learning. Preserving relative spatial distances in the latent space, channel charting is well suited to support user localization. While prior work on channel charting has mainly focused on two-dimensional scenarios, real-world environments are inherently three-dimensional. In this work, we investigate two distinct three-dimensional indoor localization scenarios using simulated, but realistic ray tracing-based datasets: a factory hall with a three-dimensional spatial distribution of datapoints, and a multistory building where each floor exhibits a two-dimensional datapoint distribution. For the first scenario, we apply the concept of augmented channel charting, which combines classical localization and channel charting, to a three-dimensional setting. For the second scenario, we introduce multistory channel charting, a two-stage approach consisting of floor classification via clustering followed by the training of a dedicated expert neural network for channel charting on each individual floor, thereby enhancing the channel charting performance. In addition, we propose a novel feature engineering method designed to extract sparse features from the beamspace channel state information that are suitable for localization.

Motivation: 鲁棒性和自适应性在卡尔曼滤波中是相互竞争的目标。鲁棒性需要暂时扩大噪声协方差估计，而自适应性则需要根据实时信息更新先验信念。实际应用中，过程噪声和测量噪声都可能受异常值影响、随时间变化或二者兼备。现有方法难以有效处理这些复杂噪声场景，因为鲁棒滤波器和自适应滤波器在本质上是不兼容的

Abstract: Robustness and adaptivity are two competing objectives in Kalman filters (KF). Robustness involves temporarily inflating prior estimates of noise covariances, while adaptivity updates prior beliefs using real-time information. In practical applications, both process and measurement noise can be influenced by outliers, be time-varying, or both. Existing works may not effectively address the above complex noise scenarios, as there is an intrinsic incompatibility between robust filters and adaptive filters. In this work, we propose a unified variational robust Kalman filter, built on a Student's t-distribution induced loss function and variational inference, and solved through fixed-point iteration in a computationally efficient manner. We demonstrate that robustness can be understood as a prerequisite for adaptivity, making it possible to merge the above two competing goals into a single framework through switching rules. Additionally, our proposed filter can recover conventional KF, robust KF, and adaptive KF by adjusting parameters, and can suppress both the imperfect process and measurement noise, enabling it to perform superiorly in complex noise environments. Simulations verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Abstract: This paper proposes an anti-interference affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) system to ensure reliability and resource efficiency under malicious high-power interference originating from adversarial devices in high-mobility scenarios. Closed-form expressions of interferences in the discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT) domain are derived by utilizing the stationary phase principle and the Affine Fourier transform convolution theorem, which indicates that interference impacts can be classified into stationary and non-stationary categories. On this basis, we reveal the analytical relationship between packet throughput and the paramerters of spread spectrum and error correction coding in our proposed anti-interference system, which enables the design of a parameter optimization algorithm that maximizes packet throughput. For reception, by jointly utilizing the autocorrelation function of spreading sequence and the cyclic-shift property of AFDM input-output relation, we design a linear-complexity correlation-based DAFT domain detector (CDD) capable of achieving full diversity gain, which performs correlation-based equalization to avoid matrix inversion. Numerical results validate the accuracy of the derived closed-form expressions and verify that the proposed anti-interference AFDM system could achieve high packet throughput under interference in high-mobility scenarios.

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) traditionally requires significant human expertise or automated trial-and-error to design deep learning models. We present NN-Caption, an LLM-guided neural architecture search pipeline that generates runnable image-captioning models by composing CNN encoders from LEMUR's classification backbones with sequence decoders (LSTM/GRU/Transformer) under a strict Net API. Using DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B as the primary generator, we present the prompt template and examples of generated architectures. We evaluate on MS COCO with BLEU-4. The LLM generated dozens of captioning models, with over half successfully trained and producing meaningful captions. We analyse the outcomes of using different numbers of input model snippets (5 vs. 10) in the prompt, finding a slight drop in success rate when providing more candidate components. We also report training dynamics (caption accuracy vs. epochs) and the highest BLEU-4 attained. Our results highlight the promise of LLM-guided NAS: the LLM not only proposes architectures but also suggests hyperparameters and training practices. We identify the challenges encountered (e.g., code hallucinations or API compliance issues) and detail how prompt rules and iterative code fixes addressed them. This work presents a pipeline that integrates prompt-based code generation with automatic evaluation, and adds dozens of novel captioning models to the open LEMUR dataset to facilitate reproducible benchmarking and downstream AutoML research.

Abstract: Unsupervised multi-domain adaptation plays a key role in transfer learning by leveraging acquired rich source information from multiple source domains to solve target task from an unlabeled target domain. However, multiple source domains often contain much redundant or unrelated information which can harm transfer performance, especially when in massive-source domain settings. It is urgent to develop effective strategies for identifying and selecting the most transferable knowledge from massive source domains to address the target task. In this paper, we propose a multi-domain adaptation method named \underline{\textit{Auto}}nomous Source Knowledge \underline{\textit{S}}election (AutoS) to autonomosly select source training samples and models, enabling the prediction of target task using more relevant and transferable source information. The proposed method employs a density-driven selection strategy to choose source samples during training and to determine which source models should contribute to target prediction. Simulteneously, a pseudo-label enhancement module built on a pre-trained multimodal modal is employed to mitigate target label noise and improve self-supervision. Experiments on real-world datasets indicate the superiority of the proposed method.

*Ryan Cartularo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文比较了端到端深度融合与上下文感知堆叠在脓毒症预测中的效果，发现基于CatBoost元学习器的上下文感知混合专家模型（SepsisLateFusion）在脓毒症预测任务上取得了最佳性能（AUC 0.915），并在抗生素选择任务上展示了多模态集成的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脓毒症占全球ICU入院病例的近20%，但传统预测模型往往无法有效整合异构数据流，要么局限于单一模态，要么依赖于脆弱的早期融合方法。因此需要开发更有效的多模态融合架构来提升脓毒症预测和临床决策支持能力。

Method: 1. 设计并比较了两种架构：端到端深度融合的Quad-Modal Hierarchical Gated Attention Network（SepsisFusionFormer）和上下文感知混合专家模型（SepsisLateFusion）。2. SepsisLateFusion将模态视为正交专家——"Historian"（静态数据）、"Monitor"（时序数据）和"Reader"（自然语言处理），通过CatBoost元学习器进行动态门控。3. 在MIMIC-IV数据集上进行实验，包括脓毒症预测和抗生素选择两个任务。

Result: 1. SepsisFusionFormer在小样本抗生素队列（N≈2100）中遭受"注意力饥饿"问题导致过拟合（AUC 0.66）。2. SepsisLateFusion在临床发作前4小时的脓毒症预测中取得了SOTA性能：AUC 0.915。3. 通过校准临床安全决策阈值，将漏诊病例相对默认操作点减少了48%。4. 在多类抗生素选择任务中，四模态集成达到了最高性能（AUC 0.72）。

Conclusion: 上下文感知的混合专家架构在脓毒症预测任务上优于端到端深度融合方法，通过动态门控多模态信息实现了更有效的临床决策支持。研究还开发了部署就绪的Python框架SepsisSuite，为及时干预提供了真正的预防窗口。

Abstract: Sepsis accounts for nearly 20% of global ICU admissions, yet conventional prediction models often fail to effectively integrate heterogeneous data streams, remaining either siloed by modality or reliant on brittle early fusion. In this work, we present a rigorous architectural comparison between End-to-End Deep Fusion and Context-Aware Stacking for sepsis tasks. We initially hypothesized that a novel Quad-Modal Hierarchical Gated Attention Network -- termed SepsisFusionFormer -- would resolve complex cross-modal interactions between vitals, text, and imaging. However, experiments on MIMIC-IV revealed that SepsisFusionFormer suffered from "attention starvation" in the small antibiotic cohort ($N \approx 2,100$), resulting in overfitting (AUC 0.66). This counterintuitive result informed the design of SepsisLateFusion, a "leaner" Context-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. By treating modalities as orthogonal experts -- the "Historian" (Static), the "Monitor" (Temporal), and the "Reader" (NLP) -- and dynamically gating them via a CatBoost meta-learner, we achieved State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance: 0.915 AUC for prediction 4 hours prior to clinical onset. By calibrating the decision threshold for clinical safety, we reduced missed cases by 48% relative to the default operating point, thus opening a true preventative window for timely intervention over reactive alerts. Furthermore, for the novel prescriptive task of multi-class antibiotic selection, we demonstrate that a Quad-Modal Ensemble achieved the highest performance (0.72 AUC). These models are integrated into SepsisSuite, a deployment-ready Python framework for clinical decision support.

Abstract: Many travel decisions involve a degree of experience formation, where individuals learn their preferences over time. At the same time, there is extensive scope for heterogeneity across individual travellers, both in their underlying preferences and in how these evolve. The present paper puts forward a Latent Class Reinforcement Learning (LCRL) model that allows analysts to capture both of these phenomena. We apply the model to a driving simulator dataset and estimate the parameters through Variational Bayes. We identify three distinct classes of individuals that differ markedly in how they adapt their preferences: the first displays context-dependent preferences with context-specific exploitative tendencies; the second follows a persistent exploitative strategy regardless of context; and the third engages in an exploratory strategy combined with context-specific preferences.

Abstract: Remotely detecting and classifying underwater acoustic targets is critical for environmental monitoring and defence. However, the complex nature of ship-radiated and environmental underwater noise poses significant challenges to accurate signal processing. While recent advancements in machine learning have improved classification accuracy, issues such as limited dataset availability and a lack of standardised experimentation hinder generalisation and robustness. This paper introduces GSE ResNeXt, a deep learning architecture integrating learnable Gabor convolutional layers with a ResNeXt backbone enhanced by squeeze-and-excitation attention mechanisms. The Gabor filters serve as two-dimensional adaptive band-pass filters, extending the feature channel representation. Its combination with channel attention improves training stability and convergence while enhancing the model's ability to extract discriminative features. The model is evaluated on three classification tasks of increasing complexity. In particular, the impact of temporal differences between the training and testing data is explored, revealing that the distance between the vessel and sensor significantly affects performance. Results show that, GSE ResNeXt consistently outperforms baseline models like Xception, ResNet, and MobileNetV2, in terms of classification performance. Regarding stability and convergence, the addition of Gabor convolutions in the initial layers of the model represents a 28% reduction in training time. These results emphasise the importance of signal processing strategies in improving the reliability and generalisation of models under different environmental conditions, especially in data-limited underwater acoustic classification scenarios. Future developments should focus on mitigating the impact of environmental factors on input signals.

Abstract: Hard-to-detect hardware bit flips, from either malicious circuitry or bugs, have already been shown to make transformers vulnerable in non-generative tasks. This work, for the first time, investigates how low-level, bitwise perturbations (fault injection) to the weights of a large language model (LLM) used for image captioning can influence the semantic meaning of its generated descriptions while preserving grammatical structure. While prior fault analysis methods have shown that flipping a few bits can crash classifiers or degrade accuracy, these approaches overlook the semantic and linguistic dimensions of generative systems. In image captioning models, a single flipped bit might subtly alter how visual features map to words, shifting the entire narrative an AI tells about the world. We hypothesize that such semantic drifts are not random but differentiably estimable. That is, the model's own gradients can predict which bits, if perturbed, will most strongly influence meaning while leaving syntax and fluency intact. We design a differentiable fault analysis framework, BLADE (Bit-level Fault Analysis via Differentiable Estimation), that uses gradient-based sensitivity estimation to locate semantically critical bits and then refines their selection through a caption-level semantic-fluency objective. Our goal is not merely to corrupt captions, but to understand how meaning itself is encoded, distributed, and alterable at the bit level, revealing that even imperceptible low-level changes can steer the high-level semantics of generative vision-language models. It also opens pathways for robustness testing, adversarial defense, and explainable AI, by exposing how structured bit-level faults can reshape a model's semantic output.

Abstract: The rapid adoption of large language models in financial services necessitates rigorous evaluation frameworks to assess their performance, efficiency, and practical applicability. This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of the GPT-OSS model family alongside contemporary LLMs across ten diverse financial NLP tasks. Through extensive experimentation on 120B and 20B parameter variants of GPT-OSS, we reveal a counterintuitive finding: the smaller GPT-OSS-20B model achieves comparable accuracy (65.1% vs 66.5%) while demonstrating superior computational efficiency with 198.4 Token Efficiency Score and 159.80 tokens per second processing speed [1]. Our evaluation encompasses sentiment analysis, question answering, and entity recognition tasks using real-world financial datasets including Financial PhraseBank, FiQA-SA, and FLARE FINERORD. We introduce novel efficiency metrics that capture the trade-off between model performance and resource utilization, providing critical insights for deployment decisions in production environments. The benchmark reveals that GPT-OSS models consistently outperform larger competitors including Qwen3-235B, challenging the prevailing assumption that model scale directly correlates with task performance [2]. Our findings demonstrate that architectural innovations and training strategies in GPT-OSS enable smaller models to achieve competitive performance with significantly reduced computational overhead, offering a pathway toward sustainable and cost-effective deployment of LLMs in financial applications.

Abstract: Effective multivariate time series forecasting often benefits from accurately modeling complex inter-variable dependencies. However, existing attention- or graph-based methods face three key issues: (a) strong temporal self-dependencies are often disrupted by irrelevant variables; (b) softmax normalization ignores and reverses negative correlations; (c) variables struggle to perceive their temporal positions. To address these, we propose \textbf{SEED}, a Spectral Entropy-guided Evaluation framework for spatial-temporal Dependency modeling. SEED introduces a Dependency Evaluator, a key innovation that leverages spectral entropy to dynamically provide a preliminary evaluation of the spatial and temporal dependencies of each variable, enabling the model to adaptively balance Channel Independence (CI) and Channel Dependence (CD) strategies. To account for temporal regularities originating from the influence of other variables rather than intrinsic dynamics, we propose Spectral Entropy-based Fuser to further refine the evaluated dependency weights, effectively separating this part. Moreover, to preserve negative correlations, we introduce a Signed Graph Constructor that enables signed edge weights, overcoming the limitations of softmax. Finally, to help variables perceive their temporal positions and thereby construct more comprehensive spatial features, we introduce the Context Spatial Extractor, which leverages local contextual windows to extract spatial features. Extensive experiments on 12 real-world datasets from various application domains demonstrate that SEED achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness and generality.

Abstract: Semantic communication aims to transmit information most relevant to a task rather than raw data, offering significant gains in communication efficiency for applications such as telepresence, augmented reality, and remote sensing. Recent transformer-based approaches have used self-attention maps to identify informative regions within images, but they often struggle in complex scenes with multiple objects, where self-attention lacks explicit task guidance. To address this, we propose a novel Multi-Modal Semantic Communication framework that integrates text-based user queries to guide the information extraction process. Our proposed system employs a cross-modal attention mechanism that fuses visual features with language embeddings to produce soft relevance scores over the visual data. Based on these scores and the instantaneous channel bandwidth, we use an algorithm to transmit image patches at adaptive resolutions using independently trained encoder-decoder pairs, with total bitrate matching the channel capacity. At the receiver, the patches are reconstructed and combined to preserve task-critical information. This flexible and goal-driven design enables efficient semantic communication in complex and bandwidth-constrained environments.

Abstract: Small language models (SLMs) are widely used in tasks that require low latency and lightweight deployment, particularly classification. As interpretability and robustness gain increasing importance, explanation-guided learning has emerged as an effective framework by introducing attribution-based supervision during training; however, deriving general and reliable attribution priors remains a significant challenge. Through an analysis of representative attribution methods in classification settings, we find that although these methods can reliably highlight class-relevant tokens, they often focus on common keywords shared by semantically similar classes. Because such classes are already difficult to distinguish under standard training, these attributions provide insufficient discriminative cues, limiting their ability to improve model differentiation. To overcome this limitation, we propose Class-Aware Attribution Prior (CAP), a novel attribution prior extraction framework that guides language models toward capturing fine-grained class distinctions and producing more salient, discriminative attribution priors. Building on this idea, we further introduce CAP Hybrid, which combines priors from CAP with those from existing attribution techniques to form a more comprehensive and balanced supervisory signal. By aligning a model's self-attribution with these enriched priors, our approach encourages the learning of diverse, decision-relevant features. Extensive experiments in full-data, few-shot, and adversarial scenarios demonstrate that our method consistently enhances both interpretability and robustness.

Abstract: The generation of synthetic data is a promising technology to make medical data available for secondary use in a privacy-compliant manner. A popular method for creating realistic patient data is the rule-based Synthea data generator. Synthea generates data based on rules describing the lifetime of a synthetic patient. These rules typically express the probability of a condition occurring, such as a disease, depending on factors like age. Since they only contain statistical information, rules usually have no specific data protection requirements. However, creating meaningful rules can be a very complex process that requires expert knowledge and realistic sample data. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate an approach to automatically generate Synthea rules based on statistics from tabular data, which we extracted from cancer reports. As an example use case, we created a Synthea module for glioblastoma from a real-world dataset and used it to generate a synthetic dataset. Compared to the original dataset, the synthetic data reproduced known disease courses and mostly retained the statistical properties. Overall, synthetic patient data holds great potential for privacy-preserving research. The data can be used to formulate hypotheses and to develop prototypes, but medical interpretation should consider the specific limitations as with any currently available approach.

The HAT architecture incorporates a tree-structured inductive bias that enables the modeling of hierarchical relationships present in the data and thus achieves significant computational savings compared to conventional flat attention models. We generalize to arbitrary depths and include a detailed computational cost analysis. Combined with curriculum learning, our method solves instances that are much larger than those in Kera et al.

Abstract: Incidental findings in CT scans, though often benign, can have significant clinical implications and should be reported following established guidelines. Traditional manual inspection by radiologists is time-consuming and variable. This paper proposes a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) and foundational vision-language models (VLMs) in a plan-and-execute agentic approach to improve the efficiency and precision of incidental findings detection, classification, and reporting for abdominal CT scans. Given medical guidelines for abdominal organs, the process of managing incidental findings is automated through a planner-executor framework. The planner, based on LLM, generates Python scripts using predefined base functions, while the executor runs these scripts to perform the necessary checks and detections, via VLMs, segmentation models, and image processing subroutines.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on a CT abdominal benchmark for three organs, in a fully automatic end-to-end manner. Our results show that the proposed framework outperforms existing pure VLM-based approaches in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning enables policy learning from pre-collected datasets without environment interaction, but existing Decision Transformer (DT) architectures struggle with long-horizon credit assignment and complex state-action dependencies. We introduce the Quantum Decision Transformer (QDT), a novel architecture incorporating quantum-inspired computational mechanisms to address these challenges. Our approach integrates two core components: Quantum-Inspired Attention with entanglement operations that capture non-local feature correlations, and Quantum Feedforward Networks with multi-path processing and learnable interference for adaptive computation. Through comprehensive experiments on continuous control tasks, we demonstrate over 2,000\% performance improvement compared to standard DTs, with superior generalization across varying data qualities. Critically, our ablation studies reveal strong synergistic effects between quantum-inspired components: neither alone achieves competitive performance, yet their combination produces dramatic improvements far exceeding individual contributions. This synergy demonstrates that effective quantum-inspired architecture design requires holistic co-design of interdependent mechanisms rather than modular component adoption. Our analysis identifies three key computational advantages: enhanced credit assignment through non-local correlations, implicit ensemble behavior via parallel processing, and adaptive resource allocation through learnable interference. These findings establish quantum-inspired design principles as a promising direction for advancing transformer architectures in sequential decision-making, with implications extending beyond reinforcement learning to neural architecture design more broadly.

Motivation: 机器学习在医疗领域应用需要可靠的置信度估计，但标准模型无法提供。保形预测虽然能在理论上提供统计保证，但其在实际医疗场景中的有效性受到校准数据集规模的限制，而医疗领域往往数据稀缺。

Method: 通过理论分析结合医疗图像分类任务的实证验证，评估不同规模校准集下保形预测的实际表现。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) is transforming healthcare, but safe clinical decisions demand reliable uncertainty estimates that standard ML models fail to provide. Conformal prediction (CP) is a popular tool that allows users to turn heuristic uncertainty estimates into uncertainty estimates with statistical guarantees. CP works by converting predictions of a ML model, together with a calibration sample, into prediction sets that are guaranteed to contain the true label with any desired probability. An often cited advantage is that CP theory holds for calibration samples of arbitrary size, suggesting that uncertainty estimates with practically meaningful statistical guarantees can be achieved even if only small calibration sets are available. We question this promise by showing that, although the statistical guarantees hold for calibration sets of arbitrary size, the practical utility of these guarantees does highly depend on the size of the calibration set. This observation is relevant in medical domains because data is often scarce and obtaining large calibration sets is therefore infeasible. We corroborate our critique in an empirical demonstration on a medical image classification task.

Abstract: Refined trajectory inference of urban rail transit is of great significance to the operation organization. In this paper, we develop a fully data-driven approach to inferring individual travel trajectories in urban rail transit systems. It utilizes data from the Automatic Fare Collection (AFC) and Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) systems to infer key trajectory elements, such as selected train, access/egress time, and transfer time. The approach includes establishing train alternative sets based on spatio-temporal constraints, data-driven adaptive trajectory inference, and trave l trajectory construction. To realize data-driven adaptive trajectory inference, a data-driven parameter estimation method based on KL divergence combined with EM algorithm (KLEM) was proposed. This method eliminates the reliance on external or survey data for parameter fitting, enhancing the robustness and applicability of the model. Furthermore, to overcome the limitations of using synthetic data to validate the result, this paper employs real individual travel trajectory data for verification. The results show that the approach developed in this paper can achieve high-precision passenger trajectory inference, with an accuracy rate of over 90% in urban rail transit travel trajectory inference during peak hours.

Abstract: We present a geometric framework for policy-constrained semantic interpretation that provably prevents hallucinated commitments in high-stakes domains. Semantic meaning is represented as direction on a unit sphere, evidence is modeled as sets of witness vectors, and admissible interpretations correspond to spherical convex regions. Policy constraints are introduced as explicit priors defined over the same manifold, separated from evidence geometry. Interpretation reduces to constrained optimization over admissible regions, with refusal emerging as a topologically necessary outcome under contradiction or policy exclusion. We connect this framework to information theory, Bayesian inference, and sheaf-theoretic semantics, proving that our complexity bounds are information-theoretically optimal. Empirical validation on large scale regulated financial data demonstrates zero hallucinated approvals across multiple policy regimes-the first such result at scale.

Conclusion: 日内个性化在长视频流媒体服务中能产生实际影响，提供了比需要模型重训练的完整实时架构更优的替代方案

Abstract: Many recommender systems in long-form video streaming reply on batch-trained models and batch-updated features, where user features are updated daily and served statically throughout the day. While efficient, this approach fails to incorporate a user's most recent actions, often resulting in stale recommendations. In this work, we present a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for intra-day personalization that selectively injects recent watch history at inference time without requiring model retraining. Our approach selectively overrides stale user features at inference time using the recent watch history, allowing the system to adapt instantly to evolving preferences. By reducing the personalization feedback loop from daily to intra-day, we observed a statistically significant 0.47% increase in key user engagement metrics which ranked among the most substantial engagement gains observed in recent experimentation cycles. To our knowledge, this is the first published evidence that intra-day personalization can drive meaningful impact in long-form video streaming service, providing a compelling alternative to full real-time architectures where model retraining is required.

Abstract: With the growing ease of academic publishing, the volume of research papers, especially in AI-related fields, has surged dramatically. This flood of publications makes it difficult for truly novel and impactful work to stand out, and manual novelty assessment is often unstable and time-consuming. Our project aims to develop a model that estimates and ranks the conceptual novelty of AI papers, enabling a data-driven and scalable assessment of research originality. Such a system can help researchers efficiently identify submissions that introduce genuinely innovative ideas rather than minor variants, and provide conference reviewers with a quantitative and consistent signal of novelty. Our approach evaluates novelty primarily through a paper's title, abstract, and semantic similarity to prior literature. Given the motivation of novelty estimation, we explore two task formulations with different modeling objectives, each offering a different perspective: (1) binary classification, which predicts the paper's absolute novelty from learned patterns of prior novel works, and (2) pairwise novelty comparison, which learns to distinguish papers by relative novelty over others. We fine-tune Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 and SciBERT on both tasks, benchmarking against GPT-5.1 to analyze how task formulation and modeling choices affect performance. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/ZhengxuYan/NoveltyRank.

Motivation: 当前的天气预报评估主要关注预测者视角和统计指标，但实际应用中预报是用来做决策的，因此需要从决策者角度量化预报的决策价值。

Method: 采用决策校准框架，在决策层面而非预测层面评估预报性能。比较机器学习和传统数值天气预报模型在不同天气依赖型决策任务中的表现。

Result: 研究发现预测层面的模型性能并不总能可靠地转化为下游决策层面的性能：有些性能差异只在决策层面才显现，不同决策任务下模型排名会变化。

Conclusion: 传统的预测评估不足以选择针对特定决策任务的最优预测模型，需要发展面向决策的评估方法。

Abstract: Standard weather forecast evaluations focus on the forecaster's perspective and on a statistical assessment comparing forecasts and observations. In practice, however, forecasts are used to make decisions, so it seems natural to take the decision-maker's perspective and quantify the value of a forecast by its ability to improve decision-making. Decision calibration provides a novel framework for evaluating forecast performance at the decision level rather than the forecast level. We evaluate decision calibration to compare Machine Learning and classical numerical weather prediction models on various weather-dependent decision tasks. We find that model performance at the forecast level does not reliably translate to performance in downstream decision-making: some performance differences only become apparent at the decision level, and model rankings can change among different decision tasks. Our results confirm that typical forecast evaluations are insufficient for selecting the optimal forecast model for a specific decision task.

Abstract: Reliable uncertainty estimation is crucial for machine learning models, especially in safety-critical domains. While exact Bayesian inference offers a principled approach, it is often computationally infeasible for deep neural networks. Monte Carlo dropout (MCD) was proposed as an efficient approximation to Bayesian inference in deep learning by applying neuron dropout at inference time \citep{gal2016dropout}. Hence, the method generates multiple sub-models yielding a distribution of predictions to estimate uncertainty. We empirically investigate its ability to capture true uncertainty and compare to Gaussian Processes (GP) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN). We find that MCD struggles to accurately reflect the underlying true uncertainty, particularly failing to capture increased uncertainty in extrapolation and interpolation regions as observed in Bayesian models. The findings suggest that uncertainty estimates from MCD, as implemented and evaluated in these experiments, is not as reliable as those from traditional Bayesian approaches for capturing epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty.

Abstract: Fourier Analysis Network (FAN) was recently proposed as a simple way to improve neural network performance by replacing part of ReLU activations with sine and cosine functions. Although several studies have reported small but consistent gains across tasks, the underlying mechanism behind these improvements has remained unclear. In this work, we show that only the sine activation contributes positively to performance, whereas the cosine activation tends to be detrimental. Our analysis reveals that the improvement is not a consequence of the sine function's periodic nature; instead, it stems from the function's local behavior near x = 0, where its non-zero derivative mitigates the vanishing-gradient problem. We further show that FAN primarily alleviates the dying-ReLU problem, in which a neuron consistently receives negative inputs, produces zero gradients, and stops learning. Although modern ReLU-like activations, such as Leaky ReLU, GELU, and Swish, reduce ReLU's zero-gradient region, they still contain input domains where gradients remain significantly diminished, contributing to slower optimization and hindering rapid convergence. FAN addresses this limitation by introducing a more stable gradient pathway. This analysis shifts the understanding of FAN's benefits from a spectral interpretation to a concrete analysis of training dynamics, leading to the development of the Dual-Activation Layer (DAL), a more efficient convergence accelerator. We evaluate DAL on three tasks: classification of noisy sinusoidal signals versus pure noise, MNIST digit classification, and ECG-based biometric recognition. In all cases, DAL models converge faster and achieve equal or higher validation accuracy compared to models with conventional activations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自参照学习虽然具有无限扩展潜力，但普遍存在模型崩溃问题。现有方法多为经验性修复，缺乏统一理论解释失败模式和修复机制的原理。

Method: 提出熵库Bregman投影框架：将闭环系统建模为分布空间中的随机Bregman投影序列；引入熵库（高熵分布）作为可控熵通量源；理论分析给出崩溃必要条件、稳定性充分条件和闭式收敛速率。

Result: 理论预测在实践中得到验证：大型语言模型自训练、强化学习中的Soft Actor-Critic和GAN优化均证实了ERBP框架的有效性；不同稳定化启发式方法对应特定的熵库选择和耦合系数。

Conclusion: ERBP将各种经验性修复方法统一为定量设计规则：监控并预算熵通量，为自参照学习系统提供了理论基础和稳定化指导原则。

Abstract: Self-referential learning -- training a model on data it generated itself -- promises boundless scalability but chronically suffers from model collapse: language models degenerate into repetitive text, GANs drop modes, and reinforcement-learning policies over-exploit. Although practitioners employ ad~hoc fixes such as real-data mixing, entropy bonuses, knowledge distillation, or retrieval-augmented generation, a single principle that explains both the failure mode and the success of these fixes has remained elusive. We present Entropy-Reservoir Bregman Projection (ERBP), an information-geometric framework that unifies these phenomena. We model the closed loop as a stochastic Bregman projection sequence in distribution space. Without external coupling, finite-sample noise forces the system to project onto an ever-shrinking empirical support, causing exponential entropy decay and eventual collapse. Introducing an Entropy Reservoir -- a high-entropy distribution mixed into each projection -- injects a controllable entropy flux that provably stabilises the dynamics. Our theory yields (i) a necessary condition for collapse, (ii) a sufficient condition that guarantees a non-trivial entropy floor, and (iii) closed-form rates that depend only on sample size and the strong-convexity/Lipschitz constants of the Bregman generator. Experiments on large-language-model self-training, Soft Actor-Critic in reinforcement learning, and GAN optimisation validate our predictions and show that disparate stabilisation heuristics correspond to specific reservoir choices and coupling coefficients. ERBP thus transforms a collection of folk remedies into a single, quantitative design rule: monitor and budget your entropy flux.

Abstract: Results in interpretability suggest that large vision and language models learn implicit linear encodings when models are biased by in-context prompting. However, the existence of similar linear representations in more general adaptation regimes has not yet been demonstrated. In this work, we develop the concept of a task matrix, a linear transformation from a base to finetuned embedding state. We demonstrate that for vision and text models and ten different datasets, a base model augmented with a task matrix achieves results surpassing linear probes, sometimes approaching finetuned levels. Our results validate the existence of cross-layer linear encodings between pretrained and finetuned architectures. Moreover, we show that a data-based approximation for such encodings is both efficient and generalizable to multiple domains. We make our implementation publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线学习可通过增量更新避免大规模数据存储和模型重计算，但现有在线回归模型在数据漂移和置信度场景下的处理能力有限，需要更通用有效的解决方案。

Method: 提出了OLR-WA（在线回归加权平均）模型，采用保守更新策略，优先考虑置信度更高的旧数据点，支持时间漂移和置信度场景，并进行了收敛性分析。

Result: OLR-WA性能接近批处理回归，优于其他在线模型，收敛速度快，即使仅用1%-10%数据初始化也能保持高R²值，且是唯一能有效处理置信度场景的模型。

Conclusion: OLR-WA模型在不同的在线线性回归任务中展现出强大的通用性和实用性，是处理数据漂移和置信度挑战的可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Online learning updates models incrementally with new data, avoiding large storage requirements and costly model recalculations. In this paper, we introduce "OLR-WA; OnLine Regression with Weighted Average", a novel and versatile multivariate online linear regression model. We also investigate scenarios involving drift, where the underlying patterns in the data evolve over time, conduct convergence analysis, and compare our approach with existing online regression models. The results of OLR-WA demonstrate its ability to achieve performance comparable to the batch regression, while also showcasing comparable or superior performance when compared with other state-of-the-art online models, thus establishing its effectiveness. Moreover, OLR-WA exhibits exceptional performance in terms of rapid convergence, surpassing other online models with consistently achieving high r2 values as a performance measure from the first iteration to the last iteration, even when initialized with minimal amount of data points, as little as 1% to 10% of the total data points. In addition to its ability to handle time-based (temporal drift) scenarios, remarkably, OLR-WA stands out as the only model capable of effectively managing confidence-based challenging scenarios. It achieves this by adopting a conservative approach in its updates, giving priority to older data points with higher confidence levels. In summary, OLR-WA's performance further solidifies its versatility and utility across different contexts, making it a valuable solution for online linear regression tasks.

Abstract: A popular paradigm for training LM agents relies on imitation learning, fine-tuning on expert trajectories. However, we show that the off-policy nature of imitation learning for multi-turn LM agents suffers from the fundamental limitation known as covariate shift: as the student policy's behavior diverges from the expert's, it encounters states not present in the training data, reducing the effectiveness of fine-tuning. Taking inspiration from the classic DAgger algorithm, we propose a novel data generation methodology for addressing covariate shift for multi-turn LLM training. We introduce on-policy expert corrections (OECs), partially on-policy data generated by starting rollouts with a student model and then switching to an expert model part way through the trajectory. We explore the effectiveness of our data generation technique in the domain of software engineering (SWE) tasks, a multi-turn setting where LLM agents must interact with a development environment to fix software bugs. Our experiments compare OEC data against various other on-policy and imitation learning approaches on SWE agent problems and train models using a common rejection sampling (i.e., using environment reward) combined with supervised fine-tuning technique. Experiments find that OEC trajectories show a relative 14% and 13% improvement over traditional imitation learning in the 7b and 32b setting, respectively, on SWE-bench verified. Our results demonstrate the need for combining expert demonstrations with on-policy data for effective multi-turn LM agent training.

Result: 在多种图上，ATLAS达到与基线方法相当的精度：在负结构偏置的异质图上相对GCN提升20个百分点，在齐性图上相对MLP提升11个百分点。多分辨率社区特征系统性地调制性能。

Conclusion: ATLAS通过多尺度拓扑社区特征为节点提供邻域上下文，避免了GNN的聚合限制，在扩展性、准确性和对偏置的鲁棒性方面显示出优势，为可解释图学习开辟了新路径。

Abstract: We present ATLAS (Adaptive Topology-based Learning at Scale for Homophilic and Heterophilic Graphs), a novel graph learning algorithm that addresses two important challenges in graph neural networks (GNNs). First, the accuracy of GNNs degrades when the graph is heterophilic. Second, iterative feature aggregation limits the scalability of GNNs to large graphs. We address these challenges by extracting topological information about graph communities at multiple levels of refinement, concatenating community assignments to the feature vector, and applying multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) to the resulting representation. This provides topological context about nodes and their neighborhoods without invoking aggregation. Because MLPs are typically more scalable than GNNs, our approach applies to large graphs without the need for sampling. Across a wide set of graphs, ATLAS achieves comparable accuracy to baseline methods, with gains as high as 20 percentage points over GCN for heterophilic graphs with negative structural bias and 11 percentage points over MLP for homophilic graphs. Furthermore, we show how multi-resolution community features systematically modulate performance in both homophilic and heterophilic settings, opening a principled path toward explainable graph learning.

Abstract: We present a novel numerical method for solving McKean-Vlasov forward-backward stochastic differential equations (MV-FBSDEs) with common noise, combining Picard iterations, elicitability and deep learning. The key innovation involves elicitability to derive a path-wise loss function, enabling efficient training of neural networks to approximate both the backward process and the conditional expectations arising from common noise - without requiring computationally expensive nested Monte Carlo simulations. The mean-field interaction term is parameterized via a recurrent neural network trained to minimize an elicitable score, while the backward process is approximated through a feedforward network representing the decoupling field. We validate the algorithm on a systemic risk inter-bank borrowing and lending model, where analytical solutions exist, demonstrating accurate recovery of the true solution. We further extend the model to quantile-mediated interactions, showcasing the flexibility of the elicitability framework beyond conditional means or moments. Finally, we apply the method to a non-stationary Aiyagari--Bewley--Huggett economic growth model with endogenous interest rates, illustrating its applicability to complex mean-field games without closed-form solutions.

Abstract: Diffusion models struggle to produce samples that respect constraints, a common requirement in scientific applications. Recent approaches have introduced regularization terms in the loss or guidance methods during sampling to enforce such constraints, but they bias the generative model away from the true data distribution. This is a problem, especially when the constraint is misspecified, a common issue when formulating constraints on scientific data. In this paper, instead of changing the loss or the sampling loop, we integrate a guidance-inspired adjustment into the denoiser itself, giving it a soft inductive bias towards constraint-compliant samples. We show that these softly constrained denoisers exploit constraint knowledge to improve compliance over standard denoisers, and maintain enough flexibility to deviate from it when there is misspecification with observed data.

Abstract: We study reinforcement learning for controlled diffusion processes with unbounded continuous state spaces, bounded continuous actions, and polynomially growing rewards: settings that arise naturally in finance, economics, and operations research. To overcome the challenges of continuous and high-dimensional domains, we introduce a model-based algorithm that adaptively partitions the joint state-action space. The algorithm maintains estimators of drift, volatility, and rewards within each partition, refining the discretization whenever estimation bias exceeds statistical confidence. This adaptive scheme balances exploration and approximation, enabling efficient learning in unbounded domains. Our analysis establishes regret bounds that depend on the problem horizon, state dimension, reward growth order, and a newly defined notion of zooming dimension tailored to unbounded diffusion processes. The bounds recover existing results for bounded settings as a special case, while extending theoretical guarantees to a broader class of diffusion-type problems. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approach through numerical experiments, including applications to high-dimensional problems such as multi-asset mean-variance portfolio selection.

Abstract: Process Reward Models (PRMs) have become essential for improving Large Language Models (LLMs) via test-time scaling, yet their effectiveness in coding remains limited due to the lack of meaningful step decompositions in code and the noise of Monte-Carlo-generated partial labels. We propose DreamPRM-Code, a coding-focused PRM that treats functions as reasoning steps using a Chain-of-Function prompting strategy to induce modular code generation, enabling PRM training and application analogous to mathematical reasoning tasks. To address label noise, DreamPRM-Code introduces a meta-learning-based correction mechanism that leverages clean final-solution unit-test labels and performs bi-level optimization to refine intermediate labels. Applying on test-time scaling, DreamPRM-Code achieved state-of-the-art performance on LiveCodeBench with 80.9 pass@1 rate, surpassing OpenAI o4-mini.

Abstract: Understanding how prices evolve over time often requires peeling back the layers of market noise to identify clear, structural behavior. Many of the tools commonly used for this purpose technical indicators, chart heuristics, or even sophisticated predictive models leave important questions unanswered. Technical indicators depend on platform-specific rules, and predictive systems typically offer little in terms of explanation. In settings that demand transparency or auditability, this poses a significant challenge. We introduce the Stock Pattern Assistant (SPA), a deterministic framework designed to extract monotonic price runs, attach relevant public events through a symmetric correlation window, and generate explanations that are factual, historical, and guardrailed. SPA relies only on daily OHLCV data and a normalized event stream, making the pipeline straight-forward to audit and easy to reproduce. To illustrate SPA's behavior in practice, we evaluate it across four equities-AAPL, NVDA, SCHW, and PGR-chosen to span a range of volatility regimes and sector characteristics. Although the evaluation period is modest, the results demonstrate how SPA consistently produces stable structural decompositions and contextual narratives. Ablation experiments further show how deterministic segmentation, event alignment, and constrained explanation each contribute to interpretability. SPA is not a forecasting system, nor is it intended to produce trading signals. Its value lies in offering a transparent, reproducible view of historical price structure that can complement analyst workflows, risk reviews, and broader explainable-AI pipelines.

TL;DR: AI生态系统多样性可以缓解知识崩溃，但存在一个最优多样性水平，过多或过少都会损害性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能的广泛使用引发了知识崩溃的担忧，即思想趋于同质化。之前的研究展示了单一模型在自己输出上训练会导致性能衰减。受生态学启发，研究模型多样性是否能减轻这种崩溃，并探究AI生态系统中最优多样性水平

Method: 构建基于多模型生态系统的实验框架，模型在其集体输出上进行训练。通过在不同语言模型间分割训练数据，并将生态系统评估十个自训练迭代周期，研究多样性对模型性能的影响

Result: 增加认识多样性确实能缓解崩溃，但仅在达到最优水平之前。研究发现：1）只有少数多样化模型的生态系统无法表达完整真实分布，导致性能迅速衰减；2）将数据分配到太多模型中会降低每个模型对真实分布的近似能力，导致在第一次迭代中就表现不佳

Conclusion: 在AI单一种植背景下，需要监控AI系统间的多样性并制定政策激励更多特定领域和社区模型的发展

Abstract: The growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) raises concerns of knowledge collapse, i.e., a reduction to the most dominant and central set of ideas. Prior work has demonstrated single-model collapse, defined as performance decay in an AI model trained on its own output. Inspired by ecology, we ask whether AI ecosystem diversity, that is, diversity among models, can mitigate such a collapse. We build on the single-model approach but focus on ecosystems of models trained on their collective output. To study the effect of diversity on model performance, we segment the training data across language models and evaluate the resulting ecosystems over ten, self-training iterations. We find that increased epistemic diversity mitigates collapse, but, interestingly, only up to an optimal level. Our results suggest that an ecosystem containing only a few diverse models fails to express the rich mixture of the full, true distribution, resulting in rapid performance decay. Yet distributing the data across too many models reduces each model's approximation capacity on the true distribution, leading to poor performance already in the first iteration step. In the context of AI monoculture, our results suggest the need to monitor diversity across AI systems and to develop policies that incentivize more domain- and community-specific models.

Abstract: In real-world applications with large state and action spaces, reinforcement learning (RL) typically employs function approximations to represent core components like the policies, value functions, and dynamics models. Although powerful approximations such as neural networks offer great expressiveness, they often present theoretical ambiguities, suffer from optimization instability and exploration difficulty, and incur substantial computational costs in practice. In this paper, we introduce the perspective of spectral representations as a solution to address these difficulties in RL. Stemming from the spectral decomposition of the transition operator, this framework yields an effective abstraction of the system dynamics for subsequent policy optimization while also providing a clear theoretical characterization. We reveal how to construct spectral representations for transition operators that possess latent variable structures or energy-based structures, which implies different learning methods to extract spectral representations from data. Notably, each of these learning methods realizes an effective RL algorithm under this framework. We also provably extend this spectral view to partially observable MDPs. Finally, we validate these algorithms on over 20 challenging tasks from the DeepMind Control Suite, where they achieve performances comparable or superior to current state-of-the-art model-free and model-based baselines.

TL;DR: 应用一致性预测进行RAG幻觉检测的研究


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管基于检索证据，RAG系统仍然容易产生幻觉。现有的检测方法主要依赖语义相似度和自然语言推理(NLI)，但这些方法的基本局限性尚未得到严格描述。本文旨在通过一致性预测提供有限样本覆盖保证，来精确量化检测能力。

Method: 使用一致性预测方法，利用约600个示例的校准集。比较了基于嵌入的方法(包括最先进的OpenAI text-embedding-3-large和交叉编码器模型)与GPT-4作为LLM判官的方法。在三个真实幻觉基准上进行评估。

Result: 在合成幻觉(Natural Questions)上达到94%覆盖率且0%误报率。但在三个真实基准上，基于嵌入的方法显示出不可接受的误报率：HaluEval为100%，RAGTruth为88%，WikiBio为50%。相比之下，GPT-4作为LLM判官在相同数据上仅达到7%误报率，证明通过推理可以解决此任务。

Conclusion: 存在'语义幻觉'现象：语义上合理的幻觉保持了与源文档的相似性，同时引入了嵌入模型无法发现的错误事实。这种局限性存在于不同的嵌入架构、LLM生成器和任务类型中，表明基于嵌入的检测对于生产级RAG部署是不够的。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems remain susceptible to hallucinations despite grounding in retrieved evidence. Current detection methods rely on semantic similarity and natural language inference (NLI), but their fundamental limitations have not been rigorously characterized. We apply conformal prediction to hallucination detection, providing finite-sample coverage guarantees that enable precise quantification of detection capabilities. Using calibration sets of approximately 600 examples, we achieve 94% coverage with 0% false positive rate on synthetic hallucinations (Natural Questions). However, on three real hallucination benchmarks spanning multiple LLMs (GPT-4, ChatGPT, GPT-3, Llama-2, Mistral), embedding-based methods - including state-of-the-art OpenAI text-embedding-3-large and cross-encoder models - exhibit unacceptable false positive rates: 100% on HaluEval, 88% on RAGTruth, and 50% on WikiBio. Crucially, GPT-4 as an LLM judge achieves only 7% FPR (95% CI: [3.4%, 13.7%]) on the same data, proving the task is solvable through reasoning. We term this the "semantic illusion": semantically plausible hallucinations preserve similarity to source documents while introducing factual errors invisible to embeddings. This limitation persists across embedding architectures, LLM generators, and task types, suggesting embedding-based detection is insufficient for production RAG deployment.

Abstract: Existing feature engineering methods based on large language models (LLMs) have not yet been applied to multi-label learning tasks. They lack the ability to model complex label dependencies and are not specifically adapted to the characteristics of multi-label tasks. To address the above issues, we propose Feature Engineering Automation for Multi-Label Learning (FEAML), an automated feature engineering method for multi-label classification which leverages the code generation capabilities of LLMs. By utilizing metadata and label co-occurrence matrices, LLMs are guided to understand the relationships between data features and task objectives, based on which high-quality features are generated. The newly generated features are evaluated in terms of model accuracy to assess their effectiveness, while Pearson correlation coefficients are used to detect redundancy. FEAML further incorporates the evaluation results as feedback to drive LLMs to continuously optimize code generation in subsequent iterations. By integrating LLMs with a feedback mechanism, FEAML realizes an efficient, interpretable and self-improving feature engineering paradigm. Empirical results on various multi-label datasets demonstrate that our FEAML outperforms other feature engineering methods.

Abstract: Learning-based methods have made significant progress in physics simulation, typically approximating dynamics with a monolithic end-to-end optimized neural network. Although these models offer an effective way to simulation, they may lose essential features compared to traditional numerical simulators, such as physical interpretability and reliability. Drawing inspiration from classical simulators that operate in a modular fashion, this paper presents Neural Modular Physics (NMP) for elastic simulation, which combines the approximation capacity of neural networks with the physical reliability of traditional simulators. Beyond the previous monolithic learning paradigm, NMP enables direct supervision of intermediate quantities and physical constraints by decomposing elastic dynamics into physically meaningful neural modules connected through intermediate physical quantities. With a specialized architecture and training strategy, our method transforms the numerical computation flow into a modular neural simulator, achieving improved physical consistency and generalizability. Experimentally, NMP demonstrates superior generalization to unseen initial conditions and resolutions, stable long-horizon simulation, better preservation of physical properties compared to other neural simulators, and greater feasibility in scenarios with unknown underlying dynamics than traditional simulators.

Abstract: Operator learning has become a powerful tool for accelerating the solution of parameterized partial differential equations (PDEs), enabling rapid prediction of full spatiotemporal fields for new initial conditions or forcing functions. Existing architectures such as DeepONet and the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) show strong empirical performance but often require large training datasets, lack explicit physical structure, and may suffer from instability in their trunk-network features, where mode imbalance or collapse can hinder accurate operator approximation. Motivated by the stability and locality of classical partition-of-unity (PoU) methods, we investigate PoU-based regularization techniques for operator learning and develop a revised formulation of the existing POU--PI--DeepONet framework. The resulting \emph{P}hysics-\emph{i}nformed \emph{P}artition \emph{P}enalty Deep Operator Network (PIP$^{2}$ Net) introduces a simplified and more principled partition penalty that improved the coordinated trunk outputs that leads to more expressiveness without sacrificing the flexibility of DeepONet. We evaluate PIP$^{2}$ Net on three nonlinear PDEs: the viscous Burgers equation, the Allen--Cahn equation, and a diffusion--reaction system. The results show that it consistently outperforms DeepONet, PI-DeepONet, and POU-DeepONet in prediction accuracy and robustness.

Abstract: Unsupervised node representation learning aims to obtain meaningful node embeddings without relying on node labels. To achieve this, graph convolution, which aggregates information from neighboring nodes, is commonly employed to encode node features and graph topology. However, excessive reliance on graph convolution can be suboptimal-especially in non-homophilic graphs-since it may yield unduly similar embeddings for nodes that differ in their features or topological properties. As a result, adjusting the degree of graph convolution usage has been actively explored in supervised learning settings, whereas such approaches remain underexplored in unsupervised scenarios. To tackle this, we propose FUEL, which adaptively learns the adequate degree of graph convolution usage by aiming to enhance intra-class similarity and inter-class separability in the embedding space. Since classes are unknown, FUEL leverages node features to identify node clusters and treats these clusters as proxies for classes. Through extensive experiments using 15 baseline methods and 14 benchmark datasets, we demonstrate the effectiveness of FUEL in downstream tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance across graphs with diverse levels of homophily.

Abstract: Multivariate time series imputation is fundamental in applications such as healthcare, traffic forecasting, and biological modeling, where sensor failures and irregular sampling lead to pervasive missing values. However, existing Transformer- and diffusion-based models lack explicit inductive biases and frequency awareness, limiting their generalization under structured missing patterns and distribution shifts. We propose FADTI, a diffusion-based framework that injects frequency-informed feature modulation via a learnable Fourier Bias Projection (FBP) module and combines it with temporal modeling through self-attention and gated convolution. FBP supports multiple spectral bases, enabling adaptive encoding of both stationary and non-stationary patterns. This design injects frequency-domain inductive bias into the generative imputation process. Experiments on multiple benchmarks, including a newly introduced biological time series dataset, show that FADTI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly under high missing rates.

Abstract: Designing effective reward functions remains a central challenge in reinforcement learning, especially in multi-objective environments. In this work, we propose Multi-Objective Reward Shaping with Exploration (MORSE), a general framework that automatically combines multiple human-designed heuristic rewards into a unified reward function. MORSE formulates the shaping process as a bi-level optimization problem: the inner loop trains a policy to maximize the current shaped reward, while the outer loop updates the reward function to optimize task performance. To encourage exploration in the reward space and avoid suboptimal local minima, MORSE introduces stochasticity into the shaping process, injecting noise guided by task performance and the prediction error of a fixed, randomly initialized neural network. Experimental results in MuJoCo and Isaac Sim environments show that MORSE effectively balances multiple objectives across various robotic tasks, achieving task performance comparable to those obtained with manually tuned reward functions.

Abstract: A central goal of interpretability is to recover representations of causally relevant concepts from the activations of neural networks. The quality of these concept representations is typically evaluated in isolation, and under implicit independence assumptions that may not hold in practice. Thus, it is unclear whether common featurization methods - including sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and sparse probes - recover disentangled representations of these concepts. This study proposes a multi-concept evaluation setting where we control the correlations between textual concepts, such as sentiment, domain, and tense, and analyze performance under increasing correlations between them. We first evaluate the extent to which featurizers can learn disentangled representations of each concept under increasing correlational strengths. We observe a one-to-many relationship from concepts to features: features correspond to no more than one concept, but concepts are distributed across many features. Then, we perform steering experiments, measuring whether each concept is independently manipulable. Even when trained on uniform distributions of concepts, SAE features generally affect many concepts when steered, indicating that they are neither selective nor independent; nonetheless, features affect disjoint subspaces. These results suggest that correlational metrics for measuring disentanglement are generally not sufficient for establishing independence when steering, and that affecting disjoint subspaces is not sufficient for concept selectivity. These results underscore the importance of compositional evaluations in interpretability research.

Abstract: This study examines the generalization performance and interpretability of machine learning (ML) models used for predicting crop yield and yield anomalies in Germany's NUTS-3 regions. Using a high-quality, long-term dataset, the study systematically compares the evaluation and temporal validation behavior of ensemble tree-based models (XGBoost, Random Forest) and deep learning approaches (LSTM, TCN).
  While all models perform well on spatially split, conventional test sets, their performance degrades substantially on temporally independent validation years, revealing persistent limitations in generalization. Notably, models with strong test-set accuracy, but weak temporal validation performance can still produce seemingly credible SHAP feature importance values. This exposes a critical vulnerability in post hoc explainability methods: interpretability may appear reliable even when the underlying model fails to generalize.
  These findings underscore the need for validation-aware interpretation of ML predictions in agricultural and environmental systems. Feature importance should not be accepted at face value unless models are explicitly shown to generalize to unseen temporal and spatial conditions. The study advocates for domain-aware validation, hybrid modeling strategies, and more rigorous scrutiny of explainability methods in data-driven agriculture. Ultimately, this work addresses a growing challenge in environmental data science: how can we evaluate generalization robustly enough to trust model explanations?

Abstract: Federated Learning is a machine learning setting that reduces direct data exposure, improving the privacy guarantees of machine learning models. Yet, the exchange of model updates between the participants and the aggregator can still leak sensitive information. In this work, we present a new gradient-based membership inference attack for federated learning scenarios that exploits the temporal evolution of last-layer gradients across multiple federated rounds. Our method uses the shadow technique to learn round-wise gradient patterns of the training records, requiring no access to the private dataset, and is designed to consider both semi-honest and malicious adversaries (aggregators or data owners). Beyond membership inference, we also provide a natural extension of the proposed attack to discrete attribute inference by contrasting gradient responses under alternative attribute hypotheses. The proposed attacks are model-agnostic, and therefore applicable to any gradient-based model and can be applied to both classification and regression settings. We evaluate the attack on CIFAR-100 and Purchase100 datasets for membership inference and on Breast Cancer Wisconsin for attribute inference. Our findings reveal strong attack performance and comparable computational and memory overhead in membership inference when compared to another attack from the literature. The obtained results emphasize that multi-round federated learning can increase the vulnerability to inference attacks, that aggregators pose a more substantial threat than data owners, and that attack performance is strongly influenced by the nature of the training dataset, with richer, high-dimensional data leading to stronger leakage than simpler tabular data.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) often converge slowly and struggle to recover high-frequency details due to spectral bias. While prior work links this behavior to the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), how specific architectural choices affect NTK conditioning remains unclear. We show that many INR mechanisms can be understood through their impact on a small set of pairwise similarity factors and scaling terms that jointly determine NTK eigenvalue variance. For standard coordinate MLPs, limited input-feature interactions induce large eigenvalue dispersion and poor conditioning. We derive closed-form variance decompositions for common INR components and show that positional encoding reshapes input similarity, spherical normalization reduces variance via layerwise scaling, and Hadamard modulation introduces additional similarity factors strictly below one, yielding multiplicative variance reduction. This unified view explains how diverse INR architectures mitigate spectral bias by improving NTK conditioning. Experiments across multiple tasks confirm the predicted variance reductions and demonstrate faster, more stable convergence with improved reconstruction quality.

Conclusion: 扩散模型草稿器能够自然地克服AR草稿器的局限性，DEER框架通过扩散模型作为草稿器，为投机解码带来了显著的加速改进

Abstract: Efficiency, as a critical practical challenge for LLM-driven agentic and reasoning systems, is increasingly constrained by the inherent latency of autoregressive (AR) decoding. Speculative decoding mitigates this cost through a draft-verify scheme, yet existing approaches rely on AR draft models (a.k.a., drafters), which introduce two fundamental issues: (1) step-wise uncertainty accumulation leads to a progressive collapse of trust between the target model and the drafter, and (2) inherently sequential decoding of AR drafters. Together, these factors cause limited speedups. In this paper, we show that a diffusion large language model (dLLM) drafters can naturally overcome these issues through its fundamentally different probabilistic modeling and efficient parallel decoding strategy. Building on this insight, we introduce DEER, an efficient speculative decoding framework that drafts with diffusion and verifies with AR models. To enable high-quality drafting, DEER employs a two-stage training pipeline to align the dLLM-based drafters with the target AR model, and further adopts single-step decoding to generate long draft segments. Experiments show DEER reaches draft acceptance lengths of up to 32 tokens, far surpassing the 10 tokens achieved by EAGLE-3. Moreover, on HumanEval with Qwen3-30B-A3B, DEER attains a 5.54x speedup, while EAGLE-3 achieves only 2.41x. Code, model, demo, etc, will be available at https://czc726.github.io/DEER/

Conclusion: Chorus通过有效学习上下文表示和自适应集成策略，成功提升了模型在未见上下文条件下的适应能力，且具有实际部署价值

Abstract: In real-world IoT applications, sensor data is usually collected under diverse and dynamic contextual conditions where factors such as sensor placements or ambient environments can significantly affect data patterns and downstream performance. Traditional domain adaptation or generalization methods often ignore such context information or use simplistic integration strategies, making them ineffective in handling unseen context shifts after deployment. In this paper, we propose Chorus, a context-aware, data-free model customization approach that adapts models to unseen deployment conditions without requiring target-domain data. The key idea is to learn effective context representations that capture their influence on sensor data patterns and to adaptively integrate them based on the degree of context shift. Specifically, Chorus first performs unsupervised cross-modal reconstruction between unlabeled sensor data and language-based context embeddings, while regularizing the context embedding space to learn robust, generalizable context representations. Then, it trains a lightweight gated head on limited labeled samples to dynamically balance sensor and context contributions-favoring context when sensor evidence is ambiguous and vice versa. To further reduce inference latency, Chorus employs a context-caching mechanism that reuses cached context representations and updates only upon detected context shifts. Experiments on IMU, speech, and WiFi sensing tasks under diverse context shifts show that Chorus outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 11.3% in unseen contexts, while maintaining comparable latency on smartphone and edge devices.

Abstract: The adsorption energy serves as a crucial descriptor for the large-scale screening of catalysts. Nevertheless, the limited distribution of training data for the extensively utilised machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP), predominantly sourced from near-equilibrium structures, results in unreliable adsorption structures and consequent adsorption energy predictions. In this context, we present DBCata, a deep generative model that integrates a periodic Brownian-bridge framework with an equivariant graph neural network to establish a low-dimensional transition manifold between unrelaxed and DFT-relaxed structures, without requiring explicit energy or force information. Upon training, DBCata effectively generates high-fidelity adsorption geometries, achieving an interatomic distance mean absolute error (DMAE) of 0.035 \textÅ on the Catalysis-Hub dataset, which is nearly three times superior to that of the current state-of-the-art machine learning potential models. Moreover, the corresponding DFT accuracy can be improved within 0.1 eV in 94\% of instances by identifying and refining anomalous predictions through a hybrid chemical-heuristic and self-supervised outlier detection approach. We demonstrate that the remarkable performance of DBCata facilitates accelerated high-throughput computational screening for efficient alloy catalysts in the oxygen reduction reaction, highlighting the potential of DBCata as a powerful tool for catalyst design and optimisation.

Abstract: Physiological signals such as electrocardiograms (ECG) and electroencephalograms (EEG) provide complementary insights into human health and cognition, yet multi-modal integration is challenging due to limited multi-modal labeled data, and modality-specific differences . In this work, we adapt the CBraMod encoder for large-scale self-supervised ECG pretraining, introducing a dual-masking strategy to capture intra- and inter-lead dependencies. To overcome the above challenges, we utilize a pre-trained CBraMod encoder for EEG and pre-train a symmetric ECG encoder, equipping each modality with a rich foundational representation. These representations are then fused via simple embedding concatenation, allowing the classification head to learn cross-modal interactions, together enabling effective downstream learning despite limited multi-modal supervision. Evaluated on emotion recognition, our approach achieves near state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating that carefully designed physiological encoders, even with straightforward fusion, substantially improve downstream performance. These results highlight the potential of foundation-model approaches to harness the holistic nature of physiological signals, enabling scalable, label-efficient, and generalizable solutions for healthcare and affective computing.

Abstract: Sparse neural systems are gaining traction for efficient continual learning due to their modularity and low interference. Architectures such as Sparse Distributed Memory Multi-Layer Perceptrons (SDMLP) construct task-specific subnetworks via Top-K activation and have shown resilience against catastrophic forgetting. However, their rigid modularity limits cross-task knowledge reuse and leads to performance degradation under high sparsity. We propose Selective Subnetwork Distillation (SSD), a structurally guided continual learning framework that treats distillation not as a regularizer but as a topology-aligned information conduit. SSD identifies neurons with high activation frequency and selectively distills knowledge within previous Top-K subnetworks and output logits, without requiring replay or task labels. This enables structural realignment while preserving sparse modularity. Experiments on Split CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and MNIST demonstrate that SSD improves accuracy, retention, and representation coverage, offering a structurally grounded solution for sparse continual learning.

Abstract: Modern representation learning increasingly relies on unsupervised and self-supervised methods trained on large-scale unlabeled data. While these approaches achieve impressive generalization across tasks and domains, evaluating embedding quality without labels remains an open challenge. In this work, we propose Persistence, a topology-aware metric based on persistent homology that quantifies the geometric structure and topological richness of embedding spaces in a fully unsupervised manner. Unlike metrics that assume linear separability or rely on covariance structure, Persistence captures global and multi-scale organization. Empirical results across diverse domains show that Persistence consistently achieves top-tier correlations with downstream performance, outperforming existing unsupervised metrics and enabling reliable model and hyperparameter selection.

Abstract: The increasing number of cyber threats and rapidly evolving tactics, as well as the high volume of data in recent years, have caused classical machine learning, rules, and signature-based defence strategies to fail, rendering them unable to keep up. An alternative, Quantum Machine Learning (QML), has recently emerged, making use of computations based on quantum mechanics. It offers better encoding and processing of high-dimensional structures for certain problems. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of QML techniques relevant to the domain of security, such as Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVMs), Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs), and Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (QGANs), and discusses the contributions of this paper in relation to existing research in the field and how it improves over them. It also maps these methods across supervised, unsupervised, and generative learning paradigms, and to core cybersecurity tasks, including intrusion and anomaly detection, malware and botnet classification, and encrypted-traffic analytics. It also discusses their application in the domain of cloud computing security, where QML can enhance secure and scalable operations. Many limitations of QML in the domain of cybersecurity have also been discussed, along with the directions for addressing them.

Abstract: Predictive maintenance of rotating machinery increasingly relies on vibration signals, yet most learning-based approaches either discard phase during spectral feature extraction or use raw time-waveforms without explicitly leveraging phase information. This paper introduces two phase-aware preprocessing strategies to address random phase variations in multi-axis vibration data: (1) three-axis independent phase adjustment that aligns each axis individually to zero phase (2) single-axis reference phase adjustment that preserves inter-axis relationships by applying uniform time shifts. Using a newly constructed rotor dataset acquired with a synchronized three-axis sensor, we evaluate six deep learning architectures under a two-stage learning framework. Results demonstrate architecture-independent improvements: the three-axis independent method achieves consistent gains (+2.7\% for Transformer), while the single-axis reference approach delivers superior performance with up to 96.2\% accuracy (+5.4\%) by preserving spatial phase relationships. These findings establish both phase alignment strategies as practical and scalable enhancements for predictive maintenance systems.

TL;DR: 提出Fusion-3框架，通过自适应融合Rocket、Sax和Sfa三种时间序列表示方法，在特定类型的数据集上相比单一Rocket方法获得更好的分类效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: kernel-based方法（如Rocket）虽然是无监督时间序列分类的有效方法，但其性能在不同数据集上表现不一。作者认为不同的表示方法捕获了互补的结构信息，有选择性地融合这些表示可以获得更一致的改进。

Method: 1. 开发Fusion-3(F3)轻量级框架，自适应融合Rocket、Sax和Sfa三种表示方法。2. 使用元特征（序列长度、谱结构、粗糙度、类别不平衡等）将UCR数据集聚类为六个可解释的数据结构簇。3. 结合三种互补分析：跨数据集的非参数配对统计、消融实验、SHAP归因分析。4. 通过样本级案例研究揭示融合机制。

Result: 在113个UCR数据集上使用5折交叉验证，F3相比Rocket获得了微小但一致的性能提升，并在具有结构化变异性或丰富频率内容的数据集上表现更好。统计分析（frequentist和Bayesian）支持了这一结论。融合主要通过对特定错误进行纠正来提高性能。

Conclusion: 有选择性地应用融合方法为强大的kernel-based方法提供了可靠且可解释的扩展，能够在数据集支持的特定情况下精确纠正这些方法的弱点。

Abstract: Kernel-based methods such as Rocket are among the most effective default approaches for univariate time series classification (TSC), yet they do not perform equally well across all datasets. We revisit the long-standing intuition that different representations capture complementary structure and show that selectively fusing them can yield consistent improvements over Rocket on specific, systematically identifiable kinds of datasets. We introduce Fusion-3 (F3), a lightweight framework that adaptively fuses Rocket, Sax, and Sfa representations. To understand when fusion helps, we cluster UCR datasets into six groups using meta-features capturing series length, spectral structure, roughness, and class imbalance, and treat these clusters as interpretable data-structure regimes. Our analysis shows that fusion typically outperforms strong baselines in regimes with structured variability or rich frequency content, while offering diminishing returns in highly irregular or outlier-heavy settings. To support these findings, we combine three complementary analyses: non-parametric paired statistics across datasets, ablation studies isolating the roles of individual representations, and attribution via SHAP to identify which dataset properties predict fusion gains. Sample-level case studies further reveal the underlying mechanism: fusion primarily improves performance by rescuing specific errors, with adaptive increases in frequency-domain weighting precisely where corrections occur. Using 5-fold cross-validation on the 113 UCR datasets, F3 yields small but consistent average improvements over Rocket, supported by frequentist and Bayesian evidence and accompanied by clearly identifiable failure cases. Our results show that selectively applied fusion provides dependable and interpretable extension to strong kernel-based methods, correcting their weaknesses precisely where the data support it.

Abstract: The growing penetration of renewable and distributed generation is transforming power systems and challenging conventional protection schemes that rely on fixed settings and local measurements. Machine learning (ML) offers a data-driven alternative for centralized fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL), enabling faster and more adaptive decision-making. However, practical deployment critically depends on robustness. Protection algorithms must remain reliable even when confronted with missing, noisy, or degraded sensor data. This work introduces a unified framework for systematically evaluating the robustness of ML models in power system protection.
  High-fidelity EMT simulations are used to model realistic degradation scenarios, including sensor outages, reduced sampling rates, and transient communication losses. The framework provides a consistent methodology for benchmarking models, quantifying the impact of limited observability, and identifying critical measurement channels required for resilient operation. Results show that FC remains highly stable under most degradation types but drops by about 13% under single-phase loss, while FL is more sensitive overall, with voltage loss increasing localization error by over 150%. These findings offer actionable guidance for robustness-aware design of future ML-assisted protection systems.

Conclusion: EUBRL算法通过认知不确定性指导实现了强化学习中的原则性探索，为处理复杂场景（稀疏奖励、长期规划、随机环境）提供了有效的贝叶斯框架，兼具理论保证和实际性能优势，为解决探索-利用困境提供了新思路。

Abstract: At the boundary between the known and the unknown, an agent inevitably confronts the dilemma of whether to explore or to exploit. Epistemic uncertainty reflects such boundaries, representing systematic uncertainty due to limited knowledge. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm, $\texttt{EUBRL}$, which leverages epistemic guidance to achieve principled exploration. This guidance adaptively reduces per-step regret arising from estimation errors. We establish nearly minimax-optimal regret and sample complexity guarantees for a class of sufficiently expressive priors in infinite-horizon discounted MDPs. Empirically, we evaluate $\texttt{EUBRL}$ on tasks characterized by sparse rewards, long horizons, and stochasticity. Results demonstrate that $\texttt{EUBRL}$ achieves superior sample efficiency, scalability, and consistency.

Abstract: Any-to-any generation seeks to translate between arbitrary subsets of modalities, enabling flexible cross-modal synthesis. Despite recent success, existing flow-based approaches are challenged by their inefficiency, as they require large-scale datasets often with restrictive pairing constraints, incur high computational cost from modeling joint distribution, and rely on complex multi-stage training. We propose FlowBind, an efficient framework for any-to-any generation. Our approach is distinguished by its simplicity: it learns a shared latent space capturing cross-modal information, with modality-specific invertible flows bridging this latent to each modality. Both components are optimized jointly under a single flow-matching objective, and at inference the invertible flows act as encoders and decoders for direct translation across modalities. By factorizing interactions through the shared latent, FlowBind naturally leverages arbitrary subsets of modalities for training, and achieves competitive generation quality while substantially reducing data requirements and computational cost. Experiments on text, image, and audio demonstrate that FlowBind attains comparable quality while requiring up to 6x fewer parameters and training 10x faster than prior methods.

Abstract: Random matrix theory has played an important role in various areas of pure mathematics, mathematical physics, and machine learning. From a practical perspective of data science, input data are usually normalized prior to processing. Thus, this study investigates the statistical properties of min-max normalized eigenvalues in random matrices. Previously, the effective distribution for such normalized eigenvalues has been proposed. In this study, we apply it to evaluate a scaling law of the cumulative distribution. Furthermore, we derive the residual error that arises during matrix factorization of random matrices. We conducted numerical experiments to verify these theoretical predictions.

Abstract: Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) reduces the cost of real-environment sampling by generating synthetic trajectories (called rollouts) from a learned dynamics model. However, choosing the length of the rollouts poses two dilemmas: (1) Longer rollouts better preserve on-policy training but amplify model bias, indicating the need for an intermediate horizon to mitigate distribution shift (i.e., the gap between on-policy and past off-policy samples). (2) Moreover, a longer model rollout may reduce value estimation bias but raise the variance of policy gradients due to backpropagation through multiple steps, implying another intermediate horizon for stable gradient estimates. However, these two optimal horizons may differ. To resolve this conflict, we propose Double Horizon Model-Based Policy Optimization (DHMBPO), which divides the rollout procedure into a long "distribution rollout" (DR) and a short "training rollout" (TR). The DR generates on-policy state samples for mitigating distribution shift. In contrast, the short TR leverages differentiable transitions to offer accurate value gradient estimation with stable gradient updates, thereby requiring fewer updates and reducing overall runtime. We demonstrate that the double-horizon approach effectively balances distribution shift, model bias, and gradient instability, and surpasses existing MBRL methods on continuous-control benchmarks in terms of both sample efficiency and runtime.

Abstract: Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRA) pose a significant threat to Federated Learning (FL) systems by enabling adversaries to infer sensitive training data from local clients. Despite extensive research, the question of how to characterize and assess the risk of DRAs in FL systems remains unresolved due to the lack of a theoretically-grounded risk quantification framework. In this work, we address this gap by introducing Invertibility Loss (InvLoss) to quantify the maximum achievable effectiveness of DRAs for a given data instance and FL model. We derive a tight and computable upper bound for InvLoss and explore its implications from three perspectives. First, we show that DRA risk is governed by the spectral properties of the Jacobian matrix of exchanged model updates or feature embeddings, providing a unified explanation for the effectiveness of defense methods. Second, we develop InvRE, an InvLoss-based DRA risk estimator that offers attack method-agnostic, comprehensive risk evaluation across data instances and model architectures. Third, we propose two adaptive noise perturbation defenses that enhance FL privacy without harming classification accuracy. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate our framework, demonstrating its potential for systematic DRA risk evaluation and mitigation in FL systems.

Abstract: Equivariance is a powerful prior for learning physical dynamics, yet exact group equivariance can degrade performance if the symmetries are broken. We propose object-centric world models built with geometric algebra neural networks, providing a soft geometric inductive bias. Our models are evaluated using simulated environments of 2d rigid body dynamics with static obstacles, where we train for next-step predictions autoregressively. For long-horizon rollouts we show that the soft inductive bias of our models results in better performance in terms of physical fidelity compared to non-equivariant baseline models. The approach complements recent soft-equivariance ideas and aligns with the view that simple, well-chosen priors can yield robust generalization. These results suggest that geometric algebra offers an effective middle ground between hand-crafted physics and unstructured deep nets, delivering sample-efficient dynamics models for multi-object scenes.

Abstract: We consider two conceptually different approaches for assessing the reliability of the individual predictions of a classifier: Robustness Quantification (RQ) and Uncertainty Quantification (UQ). We compare both approaches on a number of benchmark datasets and show that there is no clear winner between the two, but that they are complementary and can be combined to obtain a hybrid approach that outperforms both RQ and UQ. As a byproduct of our approach, for each dataset, we also obtain an assessment of the relative importance of uncertainty and robustness as sources of unreliability.

Motivation: 现有基于图消息传递的模型（如GAT或Transformer）主要关注两两token间的交互，而作者认为更高阶的交互可能对任务更敏感。因此，研究如何将注意力机制扩展到高阶交互，并有效管理由此带来的计算复杂度。

Method: 1. 引入N-simplicial注意力机制，将pairwise token相似度扩展到N阶simplicial相互作用；2. 适配RoPE（Rotary Position Embeddings）；3. 提出cost-effective simplex选择机制，使模型能够将计算集中在任务敏感的高阶交互上；4. 分析了该机制的平滑性质，推导了Lipschitz上界，并证明了尽管扩展到了高阶交互，该机制仍存在过平滑问题。

Result: 论文提出了一个理论上完备的N-simplicial注意力框架，能够捕获高阶token交互，同时通过simplex选择机制有效管理计算复杂度。理论分析表明该机制具有Lipschitz连续性，但也存在过平滑的固有问题。

Conclusion: N-simplicial注意力机制为扩展传统注意力机制提供了新方向，能够捕获更高阶的token交互，而提出的simplex选择机制为解决计算复杂度问题提供了实用方案。然而，该机制仍面临过平滑等基本挑战，这为未来研究指出了方向。

Abstract: Going from pure Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to a learnable graph message-passing mechanism at each layer has been foundational to state-of-the-art results, despite the computational trade-off (e.g. GATs or Transformers). To go a step further, in this work, we introduce N-simplicial attention, going from pairwise token similarity to higher-order interactions, and adapt it for Rotary Position Embeddings (RoPE). To help manage the increased complexity, we propose a cost-effective simplex selection enabling the model to focus its computation load onto the more task-sensitive interactions. Beyond these core mechanisms, we study how smoothing N-simplicial attention is by deriving a Lipschitz upper-bound and by demonstrating that by itself it also suffers from over-smoothing, despite opening the attention message-passing to higher-order interactions.

Abstract: Understanding the temporal evolution of sets of vectors is a fundamental challenge across various domains, including ecology, crime analysis, and linguistics. For instance, ecosystem structures evolve due to interactions among plants, herbivores, and carnivores; the spatial distribution of crimes shifts in response to societal changes; and word embedding vectors reflect cultural and semantic trends over time. However, analyzing such time-varying sets of vectors is challenging due to their complicated structures, which also evolve over time. In this work, we propose a novel method for modeling the distribution underlying each set of vectors using infinite-dimensional Gaussian processes. By approximating the latent function in the Gaussian process with Random Fourier Features, we obtain compact and comparable vector representations over time. This enables us to track and visualize temporal transitions of vector sets in a low-dimensional space. We apply our method to both sociological data (crime distributions) and linguistic data (word embeddings), demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing temporal dynamics. Our results show that the proposed approach provides interpretable and robust representations, offering a powerful framework for analyzing structural changes in temporally indexed vector sets across diverse domains.

Abstract: Feature and instance co-selection, which aims to reduce both feature dimensionality and sample size by identifying the most informative features and instances, has attracted considerable attention in recent years. However, when dealing with unlabeled incomplete multi-view data, where some samples are missing in certain views, existing methods typically first impute the missing data and then concatenate all views into a single dataset for subsequent co-selection. Such a strategy treats co-selection and missing data imputation as two independent processes, overlooking potential interactions between them. The inter-sample relationships gleaned from co-selection can aid imputation, which in turn enhances co-selection performance. Additionally, simply merging multi-view data fails to capture the complementary information among views, ultimately limiting co-selection effectiveness. To address these issues, we propose a novel co-selection method, termed Joint learning of Unsupervised multI-view feature and instance Co-selection with cross-viEw imputation (JUICE). JUICE first reconstructs incomplete multi-view data using available observations, bringing missing data recovery and feature and instance co-selection together in a unified framework. Then, JUICE leverages cross-view neighborhood information to learn inter-sample relationships and further refine the imputation of missing values during reconstruction. This enables the selection of more representative features and instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JUICE outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: G2RL是一个梯度引导的强化学习框架，不再依赖外部启发式方法（如熵奖励），而是利用模型自身的一阶更新几何来指导探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习中的探索机制与大语言模型的实际学习方式存在错配。熵奖励和外部语义比较器鼓励表面变化，但无法保证采样的轨迹在影响优化的更新方向上有所差异。

Method: G2RL为每个响应从前向传播中低成本获取模型最终层的敏感性，构建序列级特征，并在采样组内比较这些特征以衡量每个轨迹如何重塑策略。为引入新颖梯度方向的轨迹提供有界乘法奖励缩放器，弱化冗余或离流形更新。

Result: 在多个数学和通用推理基准上，G2RL在各项指标上均优于基于熵的GRPO和外部嵌入方法。分析显示，G2RL将探索扩展到更多正交甚至对立的梯度方向，同时保持语义连贯。

Conclusion: 策略自身的更新空间为大型语言模型强化学习中的探索提供了更忠实有效的指导基础。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become essential for strengthening the reasoning abilities of large language models, yet current exploration mechanisms remain fundamentally misaligned with how these models actually learn. Entropy bonuses and external semantic comparators encourage surface level variation but offer no guarantee that sampled trajectories differ in the update directions that shape optimization. We propose G2RL, a gradient guided reinforcement learning framework in which exploration is driven not by external heuristics but by the model own first order update geometry. For each response, G2RL constructs a sequence level feature from the model final layer sensitivity, obtainable at negligible cost from a standard forward pass, and measures how each trajectory would reshape the policy by comparing these features within a sampled group. Trajectories that introduce novel gradient directions receive a bounded multiplicative reward scaler, while redundant or off manifold updates are deemphasized, yielding a self referential exploration signal that is naturally aligned with PPO style stability and KL control. Across math and general reasoning benchmarks (MATH500, AMC, AIME24, AIME25, GPQA, MMLUpro) on Qwen3 base 1.7B and 4B models, G2RL consistently improves pass@1, maj@16, and pass@k over entropy based GRPO and external embedding methods. Analyzing the induced geometry, we find that G2RL expands exploration into substantially more orthogonal and often opposing gradient directions while maintaining semantic coherence, revealing that a policy own update space provides a far more faithful and effective basis for guiding exploration in large language model reinforcement learning.

Abstract: Diffusion language models are structurally well-suited for iterative error correction, as their non-causal denoising dynamics allow arbitrary positions in a sequence to be revised. However, standard masked diffusion language model (MDLM) training fails to reliably induce this behavior, as models often cannot identify unreliable tokens in a complete input, rendering confidence-guided refinement ineffective. We study corrective behavior in diffusion language models, defined as the ability to assign lower confidence to incorrect tokens and iteratively refine them while preserving correct content. We show that this capability is not induced by conventional masked diffusion objectives and propose a correction-oriented post-training principle that explicitly supervises visible incorrect tokens, enabling error-aware confidence and targeted refinement. To evaluate corrective behavior, we introduce the Code Revision Benchmark (CRB), a controllable and executable benchmark for assessing error localization and in-place correction. Experiments on code revision tasks and controlled settings demonstrate that models trained with our approach substantially outperform standard MDLMs in correction scenarios, while also improving pure completion performance. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhangshuibai/CDLM.

Abstract: Autoregressive models (ARMs) currently constitute the dominant paradigm for large language models (LLMs). Energy-based models (EBMs) represent another class of models, which have historically been less prevalent in LLM development, yet naturally characterize the optimal policy in post-training alignment. In this paper, we provide a unified view of these two model classes. Taking the chain rule of probability as a starting point, we establish an explicit bijection between ARMs and EBMs in function space, which we show to correspond to a special case of the soft Bellman equation in maximum entropy reinforcement learning. Building upon this bijection, we derive the equivalence between supervised learning of ARMs and EBMs. Furthermore, we analyze the distillation of EBMs into ARMs by providing theoretical error bounds. Our results provide insights into the ability of ARMs to plan ahead, despite being based on the next-token prediction paradigm.

Abstract: Recent advances in explainable recommendations have explored the integration of language models to analyze natural language rationales for user-item interactions. Despite their potential, existing methods often rely on ID-based representations that obscure semantic meaning and impose structural constraints on language models, thereby limiting their applicability in open-ended scenarios. These challenges are intensified by the complex nature of real-world interactions, where diverse user intents are entangled and collaborative signals rarely align with linguistic semantics. To overcome these limitations, we propose BEAT, a unified and transferable framework that tokenizes user and item behaviors into discrete, interpretable sequences. We construct a behavior vocabulary via a vector-quantized autoencoding process that disentangles macro-level interests and micro-level intentions from graph-based representations. We then introduce multi-level semantic supervision to bridge the gap between behavioral signals and language space. A semantic alignment regularization mechanism is designed to embed behavior tokens directly into the input space of frozen language models. Experiments on three public datasets show that BEAT improves zero-shot recommendation performance while generating coherent and informative explanations. Further analysis demonstrates that our behavior tokens capture fine-grained semantics and offer a plug-and-play interface for integrating complex behavior patterns into large language models.

Abstract: The multi-step denoising process in diffusion and Flow Matching models causes major efficiency issues, which motivates research on few-step generation. We present Solution Flow Models (SoFlow), a framework for one-step generation from scratch. By analyzing the relationship between the velocity function and the solution function of the velocity ordinary differential equation (ODE), we propose a Flow Matching loss and a solution consistency loss to train our models. The Flow Matching loss allows our models to provide estimated velocity fields for Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) during training, which improves generation performance. Notably, our consistency loss does not require the calculation of the Jacobian-vector product (JVP), a common requirement in recent works that is not well-optimized in deep learning frameworks like PyTorch. Experimental results indicate that, when trained from scratch using the same Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture and an equal number of training epochs, our models achieve better FID-50K scores than MeanFlow models on the ImageNet 256x256 dataset.

Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework, for the detection, classification, and preliminary localization of anomalies in water distribution networks using multivariate statistical analysis. The approach, termed SICAMS (Statistical Identification and Classification of Anomalies in Mahalanobis Space), processes heterogeneous pressure and flow sensor data through a whitening transformation to eliminate spatial correlations among measurements. Based on the transformed data, the Hotelling's $T^2$ statistic is constructed, enabling the formulation of anomaly detection as a statistical hypothesis test of network conformity to normal operating conditions. It is shown that Hotelling's $T^2$ statistic can serve as an integral indicator of the overall "health" of the system, exhibiting correlation with total leakage volume, and thereby enabling approximate estimation of water losses via a regression model. A heuristic algorithm is developed to analyze the $T^2$ time series and classify detected anomalies into abrupt leaks, incipient leaks, and sensor malfunctions. Furthermore, a coarse leak localization method is proposed, which ranks sensors according to their statistical contribution and employs Laplacian interpolation to approximate the affected region within the network. Application of the proposed framework to the BattLeDIM L-Town benchmark dataset demonstrates high sensitivity and reliability in leak detection, maintaining robust performance even under multiple leaks. These capabilities make the method applicable to real-world operational environments without the need for a calibrated hydraulic model.

Abstract: We introduce FrontierCS, a benchmark of 156 open-ended problems across diverse areas of computer science, designed and reviewed by experts, including CS PhDs and top-tier competitive programming participants and problem setters. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on tasks with known optimal solutions, FrontierCS targets problems where the optimal solution is unknown, but the quality of a solution can be objectively evaluated. Models solve these tasks by implementing executable programs rather than outputting a direct answer. FrontierCS includes algorithmic problems, which are often NP-hard variants of competitive programming problems with objective partial scoring, and research problems with the same property. For each problem we provide an expert reference solution and an automatic evaluator. Combining open-ended design, measurable progress, and expert curation, FrontierCS provides a benchmark at the frontier of computer-science difficulty. Empirically, we find that frontier reasoning models still lag far behind human experts on both the algorithmic and research tracks, that increasing reasoning budgets alone does not close this gap, and that models often over-optimize for generating merely workable code instead of discovering high-quality algorithms and system designs.

Abstract: In a mathematical model of interacting biological organisms, where external interventions may alter behavior over time, traditional models that assume fixed parameters usually do not capture the evolving dynamics. In oncology, this is further exacerbated by the fact that experimental data are often sparse and sometimes are composed of a few time points of tumor volume. In this paper, we propose to learn time-varying interactions between cells, such as those of bladder cancer tumors and immune cells, and their response to a combination of anticancer treatments in a limited data scenario. We employ the physics-informed neural network (PINN) approach to predict possible subpopulation trajectories at time points where no observed data are available. We demonstrate that our approach is consistent with the biological explanation of subpopulation trajectories. Our method provides a framework for learning evolving interactions among biological organisms when external interventions are applied to their environment.

Abstract: Whole-slide images (WSIs) contain tissue information distributed across multiple magnification levels, yet most self-supervised methods treat these scales as independent views. This separation prevents models from learning representations that remain stable when resolution changes, a key requirement for practical neuropathology workflows. This study introduces Magnification-Aware Distillation (MAD), a self-supervised strategy that links low-magnification context with spatially aligned high-magnification detail, enabling the model to learn how coarse tissue structure relates to fine cellular patterns. The resulting foundation model, MAD-NP, is trained entirely through this cross-scale correspondence without annotations. A linear classifier trained only on 10x embeddings maintains 96.7% of its performance when applied to unseen 40x tiles, demonstrating strong resolution-invariant representation learning. Segmentation outputs remain consistent across magnifications, preserving anatomical boundaries and minimizing noise. These results highlight the feasibility of scalable, magnification-robust WSI analysis using a unified embedding space

Motivation: 目前Fagotti评分在诊断性腹腔镜下评估晚期卵巢癌手术可行性时存在主观性和操作者依赖性，限制了其可重复性和广泛应用，需要一种标准化的客观评估方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个能够从腹腔镜视频自动预测细胞减灭术可行性并提供FS评估的AI模型，其在不同数据集上的可重复且可靠的性能表明，AI可以通过标准化术中肿瘤负荷评估来支持外科医生的临床决策。

Abstract: Advanced Ovarian Cancer (AOC) is often diagnosed at an advanced stage with peritoneal carcinosis (PC). Fagotti score (FS) assessment at diagnostic laparoscopy (DL) guides treatment planning by estimating surgical resectability, but its subjective and operator-dependent nature limits reproducibility and widespread use. Videos of patients undergoing DL with concomitant FS assessments at a referral center were retrospectively collected and divided into a development dataset, for data annotation, AI training and evaluation, and an independent test dataset, for internal validation. In the development dataset, FS-relevant frames were manually annotated for anatomical structures and PC. Deep learning models were trained to automatically identify FS-relevant frames, segment structures and PC, and predict video-level FS and indication to surgery (ItS). AI performance was evaluated using Dice score for segmentation, F1-scores for anatomical stations (AS) and ItS prediction, and root mean square error (RMSE) for final FS estimation. In the development dataset, the segmentation model trained on 7,311 frames, achieved Dice scores of 70$\pm$3% for anatomical structures and 56$\pm$3% for PC. Video-level AS classification achieved F1-scores of 74$\pm$3% and 73$\pm$4%, FS prediction showed normalized RMSE values of 1.39$\pm$0.18 and 1.15$\pm$0.08, and ItS reached F1-scores of 80$\pm$8% and 80$\pm$2% in the development (n=101) and independent test datasets (n=50), respectively. This is the first AI model to predict the feasibility of cytoreductive surgery providing automated FS estimation from DL videos. Its reproducible and reliable performance across datasets suggests that AI can support surgeons through standardized intraoperative tumor burden assessment and clinical decision-making in AOC.

Abstract: Atomic electron tomography (AET) enables the determination of 3D atomic structures by acquiring a sequence of 2D tomographic projection measurements of a particle and then computationally solving for its underlying 3D representation. Classical tomography algorithms solve for an intermediate volumetric representation that is post-processed into the atomic structure of interest. In this paper, we reformulate the tomographic inverse problem to solve directly for the locations and properties of individual atoms. We parameterize an atomic structure as a collection of Gaussians, whose positions and properties are learnable. This representation imparts a strong physical prior on the learned structure, which we show yields improved robustness to real-world imaging artifacts. Simulated experiments and a proof-of-concept result on experimentally-acquired data confirm our method's potential for practical applications in materials characterization and analysis with Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM).

Abstract: This study develops meta-learners for few-shot weakly-supervised segmentation (FWS) to address the challenge of optic disc (OD) and optic cup (OC) segmentation for glaucoma diagnosis with limited labeled fundus images. We significantly improve existing meta-learners by introducing Omni meta-training which balances data usage and diversifies the number of shots. We also develop their efficient versions that reduce computational costs. In addition, we develop sparsification techniques that generate more customizable and representative scribbles and other sparse labels. After evaluating multiple datasets, we find that Omni and efficient versions outperform the original versions, with the best meta-learner being Efficient Omni ProtoSeg (EO-ProtoSeg). It achieves intersection over union (IoU) scores of 88.15% for OD and 71.17% for OC on the REFUGE dataset using just one sparsely labeled image, outperforming few-shot and semi-supervised methods which require more labeled images. Its best performance reaches 86.80% for OD and 71.78%for OC on DRISHTIGS, 88.21% for OD and 73.70% for OC on REFUGE, 80.39% for OD and 52.65% for OC on REFUGE. EO-ProtoSeg is comparable to unsupervised domain adaptation methods yet much lighter with less than two million parameters and does not require any retraining.

Motivation: 现有的生成式人脸视频编码方法主要关注视频运动，忽视了音频在比特率中的显著贡献。虽然音频与唇部运动之间存在明确的相关性，但这种跨模态一致性在压缩领域尚未被系统性地利用。

Method: 提出AVCC框架，从视频中提取运动信息，对音频特征进行标记化，然后通过统一的音频-视频扩散过程对齐两者，实现从共享表示中同步重建双模态。在极低码率场景下，AVCC甚至可以从另一模态重建缺失模态。

Result: 实验表明，AVCC在率失真性能上显著优于VVC标准和最先进的GFVC方案。

Conclusion: 该研究为更高效的多模态通信系统开辟了新途径，通过充分利用音频-视觉相关性提升压缩效率。

Abstract: Generative face video coding (GFVC) is vital for modern applications like video conferencing, yet existing methods primarily focus on video motion while neglecting the significant bitrate contribution of audio. Despite the well-established correlation between audio and lip movements, this cross-modal coherence has not been systematically exploited for compression. To address this, we propose an Audio-Visual Cross-Modal Compression (AVCC) framework that jointly compresses audio and video streams. Our framework extracts motion information from video and tokenizes audio features, then aligns them through a unified audio-video diffusion process. This allows synchronized reconstruction of both modalities from a shared representation. In extremely low-rate scenarios, AVCC can even reconstruct one modality from the other. Experiments show that AVCC significantly outperforms the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard and state-of-the-art GFVC schemes in rate-distortion performance, paving the way for more efficient multimodal communication systems.

Abstract: Spectroscopic photoacoustic (sPA) imaging can potentially estimate blood oxygenation saturation (sO2) in vivo noninvasively. However, quantitatively accurate results require accurate optical fluence estimates. Robust modeling in heterogeneous tissue, where light with different wavelengths can experience significantly different absorption and scattering, is difficult. In this work, we developed a deep neural network (Hybrid-Net) for sPA imaging to simultaneously estimate sO2 in blood vessels and segment those vessels from surrounding background tissue. sO2 error was minimized only in blood vessels segmented in Hybrid-Net, resulting in more accurate predictions. Hybrid-Net was first trained on simulated sPA data (at 700 nm and 850 nm) representing initial pressure distributions from three-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations of light transport in breast tissue. Then, for experimental verification, the network was retrained on experimental sPA data (at 700 nm and 850 nm) acquired from simple tissue mimicking phantoms with an embedded blood pool. Quantitative measures were used to evaluate Hybrid-Net performance with an averaged segmentation accuracy of >= 0.978 in simulations with varying noise levels (0dB-35dB) and 0.998 in the experiment, and an averaged sO2 mean squared error of <= 0.048 in simulations with varying noise levels (0dB-35dB) and 0.003 in the experiment. Overall, these results show that Hybrid-Net can provide accurate blood oxygenation without estimating the optical fluence, and this study could lead to improvements in in-vivo sO2 estimation.

This study presents a comprehensive longitudinal evaluation of pediatric iris recognition, analyzing 276 subjects enrolled between ages 4-12 and followed up to nine years through adolescence. Using 18,318 near-infrared iris images acquired semi-annually, we evaluated commercial (VeriEye) and open-source (OpenIris) systems through linear mixed-effects models that disentangle enrollment age, developmental maturation, and elapsed time while controlling for image quality and physiological factors. False non-match rates remained below 0.5% across the nine-year period for both matchers using pediatric-calibrated thresholds, approaching adult-level performance. However, we reveal significant algorithm-dependent temporal behaviors: VeriEye's apparent decline reflects developmental confounding across enrollment cohorts rather than genuine template aging, while OpenIris exhibits modest but genuine temporal aging (0.5 standard deviations over eight years). Image quality and pupil dilation constancy dominated longitudinal performance, with dilation effects reaching 3.0-3.5 standard deviations, substantially exceeding temporal factors. Failures concentrated in 9.4% of subjects with persistent acquisition challenges rather than accumulating with elapsed time, confirming acquisition conditions as the primary limitation. These findings justify extending conservative re-enrollment policies, potentially to 10-12 year validity periods for high-quality enrollments at ages 7+, and demonstrate iris recognition remains viable throughout childhood and adolescence with proper imaging control.

Abstract: Smartphone-based iris recognition in the visible spectrum (VIS) offers a low-cost and accessible biometric alternative but remains a challenge due to lighting variability, pigmentation effects, and the limited adoption of standardized capture protocols. In this work, we present CUVIRIS, a dataset of 752 ISO/IEC 29794-6 compliant iris images from 47 subjects, collected with a custom Android application that enforces real-time framing, sharpness assessment, and quality feedback. We further introduce LightIrisNet, a MobileNetV3-based multi-task segmentation model optimized for on-device deployment. In addition, we adapt IrisFormer, a transformer-based matcher, to the VIS domain. We evaluate OSIRIS and IrisFormer under a standardized protocol and benchmark against published CNN baselines reported in prior work. On CUVIRIS, the open-source OSIRIS system achieves a TAR of 97.9% at FAR = 0.01 (EER = 0.76%), while IrisFormer, trained only on the UBIRIS.v2 dataset, achieves an EER of 0.057\%. To support reproducibility, we release the Android application, LightIrisNet, trained IrisFormer weights, and a subset of the CUVIRIS dataset. These results show that, with standardized acquisition and VIS-adapted lightweight models, accurate iris recognition on commodity smartphones is feasible under controlled conditions, bringing this modality closer to practical deployment.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Brain metastases affect approximately between 20% and 40% of cancer patients and are commonly treated with radiotherapy or radiosurgery. Early prediction of recurrence following treatment could enable timely clinical intervention and improve patient outcomes. This study proposes an artificial intelligence based approach for predicting brain metastasis recurrence using multimodal imaging and clinical data. A retrospective cohort of 97 patients was collected, including Computed Tomography (CT) and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) acquired before treatment and at first follow-up, together with relevant clinical variables. Image preprocessing included CT windowing and artifact reduction, MRI enhancement, and multimodal CT MRI registration. After applying inclusion criteria, 53 patients were retained for analysis. Radiomics features were extracted from the imaging data, and delta radiomics was employed to characterize temporal changes between pre-treatment and follow-up scans. Multiple machine learning classifiers were trained and evaluated, including an analysis of discrepancies between treatment planning target volumes and delivered isodose volumes. Despite limitations related to sample size and class imbalance, the results demonstrate the feasibility of radiomics based models, namely ensemble models, for recurrence prediction and suggest a potential association between radiation dose discrepancies and recurrence risk. This work supports further investigation of AI-driven tools to assist clinical decision-making in brain metastasis management.
