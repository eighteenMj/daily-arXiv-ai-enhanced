The inherent difficulty of modeling MILPs that accurately represent stochastic real world problems leads to suboptimal performance in the real world. Recently, machine learning methods have been applied to build MILP models for decision quality rather than how accurately they model the real world problem. However, these approaches typically rely on supervised learning, assume access to true optimal decisions, and use surrogates for the MILP gradients. In this work, we introduce a proof of concept CORL framework that end to end fine tunes an MILP scheme using reinforcement learning (RL) on real world data to maximize its operational performance. We enable this by casting an MILP solved by B&B as a differentiable stochastic policy compatible with RL. We validate the CORL method in a simple illustrative combinatorial sequential decision making example.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recent work demonstrates that techniques such as repeated sampling, self-verification, and self-reflection can significantly enhance task success by allocating more inference-time compute. However, applying these techniques across multiple agents in a multi-agent system is difficult: there does not exist principled mechanisms to allocate compute to foster collaboration among agents, to extend test-time scaling to collaborative interactions, or to distribute compute across agents under explicit budget constraints. To address this gap, we propose FutureWeaver, a framework for planning and optimizing test-time compute allocation in multi-agent systems under fixed budgets. FutureWeaver introduces modularized collaboration, formalized as callable functions that encapsulate reusable multi-agent workflows. These modules are automatically derived through self-play reflection by abstracting recurring interaction patterns from past trajectories. Building on these modules, FutureWeaver employs a dual-level planning architecture that optimizes compute allocation by reasoning over the current task state while also speculating on future steps. Experiments on complex agent benchmarks demonstrate that FutureWeaver consistently outperforms baselines across diverse budget settings, validating its effectiveness for multi-agent collaboration in inference-time optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Firstly, the equivalent sphere decoding (ESD) is proposed, which is essentially the same with the classic Fincke-Pohst sphere decoding but characterizes the sphere radius $D>0$ with two new parameters named as initial searching size $K>1$ and deviation factor $\u03c3>0$. By fixing $\u03c3$ properly, we show that given the sphere radius $D\\triangleq\u03c3\\sqrt{2\\ln K}$, the complexity of ESD in terms of the number of visited nodes is upper bounded by $|S|<nK$, thus resulting in an explicit and tractable decoding trade-off solely controlled by $K$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the complexity of sphere decoding is exactly specified, where considerable decoding potential can be explored from it. After that, two enhancement mechanisms named as normalized weighting and candidate protection are proposed to further upgrade the ESD algorithm. On one hand, given the same setups of $K$ and $\u03c3$, a larger sphere radius is achieved, indicating a better decoding trade-off. On the other hand, the proposed ESD algorithm is generalized, which bridges suboptimal and optimal decoding performance through the flexible choice of $K$. Finally, further performance optimization and complexity reduction with respect to ESD are also derived, and the introduced tractable and flexible decoding trade-off is verified through large-scale MIMO detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5bf9\u7403\u578b\u89e3\u7801\uff08SD\uff09\u8303\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u81ea\u7531\u5ea6\u6765\u5f00\u53d1\u89e3\u7801\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u5177\u4f53\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7b49\u6548\u7403\u578b\u89e3\u7801\uff08ESD\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570K\u548c\u03c3\u660e\u786e\u754c\u5b9a\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u5019\u9009\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u8c03\u63a7\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7403\u578b\u89e3\u7801\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u96be\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u63cf\u8ff0\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5728\u6574\u6570\u6700\u5c0f\u4e8c\u4e58\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u660e\u786e\u4e14\u53ef\u8c03\u63a7\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7cbe\u786e\u91cf\u5316\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u5e76\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u89e3\u7801\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7b49\u6548\u7403\u578b\u89e3\u7801\uff08ESD\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u521d\u59cb\u641c\u7d22\u5927\u5c0fK\u548c\u504f\u5dee\u56e0\u5b50\u03c3\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u53c2\u6570\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u7403\u534a\u5f84D\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u8bbe\u7f6eD=\u03c3\u221a(2lnK)\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0a\u754c|S|<nK\u7684\u660e\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u89c4\u8303\u5316\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u5019\u9009\u4fdd\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u6765\u589e\u5f3aESD\u7b97\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660eESD\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u7cbe\u786e\u9650\u5b9a\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u660e\u786e\u53ef\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u7403\u578b\u89e3\u7801\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002\u589e\u5f3a\u673a\u5236\u5728\u76f8\u540cK\u548c\u03c3\u53c2\u6570\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u7403\u534a\u5f84\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u6743\u8861\u3002ESD\u7b97\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u7075\u6d3b\u8c03\u8282K\u6765\u8fde\u63a5\u6b21\u4f18\u548c\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "ESD\u4e3a\u7403\u578b\u89e3\u7801\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53ef\u8c03\u63a7\u4e14\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6-\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21MIMO\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u89e3\u7801\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3002"}}

The core methodology involves leveraging semantic information from image captions during model training to improve generalization capabilities. Two key strategies are presented: Image Text Matching (ITM) guidance and Image Text fusion. ITM guidance trains the model to discern fine grained alignments between images and texts to obtain enhanced multimodal representations. Image text fusion combines both modalities into comprehensive representations for improved fairness. Exensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate these approaches effectively mitigate bias and improve accuracy across gender racial groups compared to existing methods. Additionally, the unique integration of textual guidance underscores an interpretable and intuitive training paradigm for computer vision systems. By scrutinizing the extent to which semantic information reduces disparities, this research offers valuable insights into cultivating more equitable facial analysis algorithms.

First, we establish a Gibbs-type variational formulation of the rate-distortion function and show that optimal test channels form an exponential family, with Fullback-Leibler divergence acting as a Bregman divergence. This yields a generalized Pythagorean theorem for projections and a Legendre duality that couples distortion constraints with inverse temperature parameters. Second, the reverse water-filling metaphor is extended to distributed lattice quantization, deriving distortion allocation bounds across eigenmodes of conditional covariance matrices. Third, inference is formalized as decoding by showing that belief propagation in LDPC ensembles and polarization in polar codes can be interpreted as recursive variational inference procedures. These results unify compression, quantization, and decoding as convex projections of continuous information onto discrete manifolds. Extensions to neural compression and quantum information are sketched as corollaries, illustrating the universality of the framework. Illustrative connections to other scientific fields are also presented. Finally, complementary numerical examples and scripts are located in the appendix", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This standard aims at providing inter-operable compressed bitstreams of features in the context of split computing, i.e., when the inference of a large computer vision neural-network (NN)-based model is split between two devices. Intermediate features can consist of multiple 3D tensors that can be reduced and entropy coded to limit the required bandwidth of such transmission. In the envisioned design for the MPEG-FCM standard, intermediate feature tensors may be reduced using Neural layers before being converted into 2D video frames that can be coded using existing video compression standards. This paper introduces an additional channel truncation and packing method which enables the system to preserve the relevant channels, depending on the statistics of the features at inference time, while preserving the computer vision task performance at the receiver.

We introduce Mixture of Bidders (MoB), a novel framework that reconceptualizes expert routing as a decentralized economic mechanism. MoB replaces learned gating networks with Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) auctions, where experts compete for each data batch by bidding their true cost -- a principled combination of execution cost (predicted loss) and forgetting cost (Elastic Weight Consolidation penalty). This game-theoretic approach provides three key advantages: (1) {stateless routing that is immune to catastrophic forgetting, (2) \\textbf{truthful bidding} guaranteed by dominant-strategy incentive compatibility, and (3) emergent specialization without explicit task boundaries. On Split-MNIST benchmarks, MoB achieves 88.77% average accuracy compared to 19.54% for Gated MoE and 27.96% for Monolithic EWC, representing a 4.5 times improvement over the strongest baseline.

Currently, to limit the risk of tip-over, mobile crane operators are forced to either reduce the slewing speed (which lowers productivity) or reduce the load being carried to reduce the induced moments. Both of these approaches reduce productivity. This paper seeks to enable rapid slewing without compromising safety by applying input shaping to the crane-slewing commands generated by the operator. A key advantage of this approach is that the input shaper requires only the information about the rope length, and does not require detailed mobile crane dynamics. Simulations and experiments show that the proposed method reduces residual payload swing and enables significantly higher slewing speeds without tip over, reducing slewing completion time by at least 38% compared to unshaped control. Human control with input shaping improves task completion time by 13%, reduces the peak swing by 18%, and reduces the potential of collisions by 82% when compared to unshaped control. Moreover, shaped control with a human had no tip-over, whereas large swing led to tip-over without input shaping. Thereby, the proposed method substantially recovers the operational-safety envelope of mobile cranes (designed to avoid tip-over using static analysis) that would otherwise be lost in dynamic conditions.

However, training VLMs for detailed reasoning requires large-scale image-text datasets. In many specialized domains, for example in reading Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) images, such precise text with grounded description of pathologies is scarce or even non-existent. To overcome this bottleneck, we introduce Synthetic Vasculature Reasoning (SVR), a framework that controllably synthesizes images and corresponding text, specifically: realistic retinal vasculature with Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) features: capillary dropout, microaneurysms, neovascularization, and tortuosity, while automatically generating granular reasoning texts. Based on this we curate OCTA-100K-SVR, an OCTA image-reasoning dataset with 100,000 pairs. Our experiments show that a general-purpose VLM (Qwen3-VL-8b) trained on the dataset achieves a zero-shot balanced classification accuracy of 89.67% on real OCTA images, outperforming supervised baselines. Through human expert evaluation we also demonstrate that it significantly enhances explanation quality and pathology localization on clinical data.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This study proposes a data-driven metric and a continuous reward function to optimize personalized heparin therapy in surgical sepsis patients. Methods: Data from the MIMIC-IV v1.0 and eICU v2.0 databases were used for model development and evaluation. The training cohort consisted of abdominal surgery patients receiving unfractionated heparin (UFH) after postoperative sepsis onset. We introduce a new RL-based framework: converting the discrete SOFA score to a continuous cxSOFA for more nuanced state and reward functions; Second, defining \"good\" or \"bad\" strategies based on cxSOFA by a stepwise manner; Third, proposing a Treatment Effect Comparison Matrix (TECM), analogous to a confusion matrix for classification tasks, to evaluate the treatment strategies. We applied different RL algorithms, Q-Learning, DQN, DDQN, BCQ and CQL to optimize the treatment and comprehensively evaluated the framework. Results: Among the AI-derived strategies, the cxSOFA-CQL model achieved the best performance, reducing mortality from 1.83% to 0.74% with the average hospital stay from 11.11 to 9.42 days. TECM demonstrated consistent outcomes across models, highlighting robustness. Conclusion: The proposed RL framework enables interpretable and robust optimization of heparin therapy in surgical sepsis. Continuous cxSOFA scoring and TECM-based evaluation provide nuanced treatment assessment, showing promise for improving clinical outcomes and decision-support reliability.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While recent work improves MAS cost-effectiveness by shaping inter-agent communication topologies and selecting agent backbones, it rarely models and optimizes under explicit token-cost and latency budgets that reflect deployment constraints. This often leads to topology-first designs and suboptimal cost-effectiveness when budgets are binding. We present AgentBalance, a framework for constructing cost-effective MAS under explicit token-cost and latency budgets via a backbone-then-topology design. AgentBalance first performs backbone-oriented agent generation, constructing agents with heterogeneous backbones through LLM pool construction, pool selection, and role-backbone matching. It then performs adaptive MAS topology generation, guiding inter-agent communication via agent representation learning, gating, and latency-aware topology synthesis. Experiments on benchmarks with 14 candidate LLM backbones show that AgentBalance achieves up to 10% and 22% performance gains under matched token-cost and latency budgets, respectively, and yields strong AUC on performance-versus-budget curves across benchmarks. AgentBalance also functions as a plug-in for existing MAS, improving performance under the same token-cost and latency constraints, and it generalizes well to unseen LLMs for practical, budget-aware deployment.

From traditional methods of manually observing the city's inhabitant, to using cameras, to now using sensors and more complex technology, the field of urban monitoring has evolved greatly. Still, there are more that can be done to unlock better practices for understanding city dynamics. This paper surveys how the landscape of urban dynamics studying has evolved with a particular focus on event-based cameras. Event-based cameras capture changes in light intensity instead of the RGB values that traditional cameras do. They offer unique abilities, like the ability to work in low-light, that can make them advantageous compared to other sensors. Through an analysis of event-based cameras, their applications, their advantages and challenges, and machine learning applications, we propose event-based cameras as a medium for capturing information to study urban dynamics. They offer the ability to capture important information while maintaining privacy. We also suggest multi-sensor fusion of event-based cameras and other sensors in the study of urban dynamics. Combining event-based cameras and infrared, event-LiDAR, or vibration has to potential to enhance the ability of event-based cameras and overcome the challenges that event-based cameras have.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7efc\u8ff0\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u5728\u57ce\u5e02\u52a8\u6001\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3001\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6848\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5176\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u3002", "motivation": "\u57ce\u5e02\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6d3b\u52a8\u76d1\u6d4b\u59cb\u7ec8\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u76d1\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982\u4f20\u7edf\u6444\u50cf\u673a\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u800c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u56e0\u5176\u72ec\u7279\u6027\u80fd\uff08\u5982\u5728\u5f31\u5149\u4e0b\u5de5\u4f5c\u3001\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\uff09\u6709\u671b\u6210\u4e3a\u57ce\u5e02\u52a8\u6001\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u65b0\u5a92\u4ecb\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u539f\u7406\u3001\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u3001\u4f18\u52bf\u4e0e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5728\u5176\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u4f5c\u4e3a\u57ce\u5e02\u52a8\u6001\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u91c7\u96c6\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u4e0e\u7ea2\u5916\u3001\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u3001\u632f\u52a8\u7b49\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u878d\u5408\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u57ce\u5e02\u52a8\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\uff1b\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u878d\u5408\uff08\u5982\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a+\u7ea2\u5916/\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe/\u632f\u52a8\uff09\u53ef\u5f25\u8865\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u76d1\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e8b\u4ef6\u76f8\u673a\u662f\u57ce\u5e02\u52a8\u6001\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u878d\u5408\u80fd\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u514b\u670d\u5176\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u57ce\u5e02\u76d1\u6d4b\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

While multimodal deep learning models - leveraging facial expressions, speech, and textual cues - offer high accuracy in emotion recognition, their training and maintenance are often computationally intensive and inflexible to modality changes. In this work, we propose a novel multi-agent framework for training multimodal emotion recognition systems, where each modality encoder and the fusion classifier operate as autonomous agents coordinated by a central supervisor. This architecture enables modular integration of new modalities (e.g., audio features via emotion2vec), seamless replacement of outdated components, and reduced computational overhead during training. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through a proof-of-concept implementation supporting vision, audio, and text modalities, with the classifier serving as a shared decision-making agent. Our framework not only improves training efficiency but also contributes to the design of more flexible, scalable, and maintainable perception modules for embodied and virtual agents in HAI scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

These metrics rely on a baseline function to alter the pixels of the input image that the attribution map deems most important. In this work, we highlight a critical problem with these metrics: the choice of a given baseline will inevitably favour certain attribution methods over others. More concerningly, even a simple linear model with commonly used baselines contradicts itself by designating different optimal methods. A question then arises: which baseline should we use? We propose to study this problem through two desirable properties of a baseline: (i) that it removes information and (ii) that it does not produce overly out-of-distribution (OOD) images. We first show that none of the tested baselines satisfy both criteria, and there appears to be a trade-off among current baselines: either they remove information or they produce a sequence of OOD images. Finally, we introduce a novel baseline by leveraging recent work in feature visualisation to artificially produce a model-dependent baseline that removes information without being overly OOD, thus improving on the trade-off when compared to other existing baselines.

While prior efforts leverage 1D representations like SELFIES to ensure molecular validity, they fail to fully exploit the rich chemical knowledge entangled within 1D models, leading to a disconnect between 1D syntactic generation and 3D geometric realization. To bridge this gap, we propose MolSculpt, a novel framework that \"sculpts\" 3D molecular geometries from chemical syntax. MolSculpt is built upon a frozen 1D molecular foundation model and a 3D molecular diffusion model. We introduce a set of learnable queries to extract inherent chemical knowledge from the foundation model, and a trainable projector then injects this cross-modal information into the conditioning space of the diffusion model to guide the 3D geometry generation. In this way, our model deeply integrates 1D latent chemical knowledge into the 3D generation process through end-to-end optimization. Experiments demonstrate that MolSculpt achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in \\textit{de novo} 3D molecule generation and conditional 3D molecule generation, showing superior 3D fidelity and stability on both the GEOM-DRUGS and QM9 datasets.

This paper presents a controlled evolution-based day-ahead robust dispatch method to address these issues. First, we suggest the convex relaxation technique to transform the maximum frequency deviation constraint to facilitate optimization. Then, an evolution-based robust dispatch framework is introduced to align day-ahead decisions with intraday strategies, ensuring both frequency security and power supply reliability. Additionally, a novel controlled evolution-based algorithm is developed to solve this framework efficiently.

Infrared cameras provide complementary advantages in such environments. Simultaneously, supervised AI systems require large labeled datasets, which makes zero-shot learning frameworks more practical for applications including infrared cameras. Recent advances in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) offer a new path in zero-shot predictions from paired image-text representations. However, current VLMs cannot understand infrared camera data since they are trained on RGB data. This work introduces VLM-IRIS (Vision-Language Models for InfraRed Industrial Sensing), a zero-shot framework that adapts VLMs to infrared data by preprocessing infrared images captured by a FLIR Boson sensor into RGB-compatible inputs suitable for CLIP-based encoders. We demonstrate zero-shot workpiece presence detection on a 3D printer bed where temperature differences between the build plate and workpieces make the task well-suited for thermal imaging. VLM-IRIS converts the infrared images to magma representation and applies centroid prompt ensembling with a CLIP ViT-B/32 encoder to achieve high accuracy on infrared images without any model retraining. These findings demonstrate that the proposed improvements to VLMs can be effectively extended to thermal applications for label-free monitoring.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86VLM-IRIS\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u5904\u7406\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u4e3aRGB\u517c\u5bb9\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9002\u914d\u4e8e\u7ea2\u5916\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5de5\u4ef6\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bb8\u591a\u5236\u9020\u73af\u5883\u5728\u4f4e\u5149\u7167\u6216\u5c01\u95ed\u673a\u5668\u4e2d\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u96be\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\uff1b\u7ea2\u5916\u76f8\u673a\u5728\u6b64\u7c7b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6709\u4f18\u52bf\u3002\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u76d1\u7763AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u800c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u6cd5\u7406\u89e3\u7ea2\u5916\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u53ea\u5728RGB\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1VLM-IRIS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528FLIR Boson\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6355\u83b7\u7ea2\u5916\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u5904\u7406\u8f6c\u6362\u6210\u5ca9\u6d46\u8868\u793a\u683c\u5f0f\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u9002\u5408CLIP\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u8d28\u5fc3\u63d0\u793a\u96c6\u6210\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CLIP ViT-B/32\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9884\u6d4b\u3002", "result": "\u57283D\u6253\u5370\u673a\u5e8a\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u5de5\u4ef6\u5b58\u5728\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6784\u5efa\u677f\u548c\u5de5\u4ef6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6e29\u5dee\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u70ed\u6210\u50cf\u6280\u672f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u68c0\u6d4b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684VLM\u6539\u8fdb\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u70ed\u6210\u50cf\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u7ea2\u5916\u4f20\u611f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, extending classical methods such as policy iteration to this setting remains difficult; the output process is non-Markovian, making policy-improvement steps interdependent across stages. We introduce a new family of monotonically improving policy-iteration algorithms that alternate between single-stage output-based policy improvements and policy evaluations according to a prescribed periodic pattern. We show that this family admits optimal patterns that maximize a natural computational-efficiency index, and we identify the simplest pattern with minimal period. Building on this structure, we further develop a model-free variant that estimates values from data and learns memoryless policies directly. Across several POMDPs examples, our method achieves significant computational speedups over policy-gradient baselines and recent specialized algorithms in both model-based and model-free settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u6539\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ea4\u66ff\u6267\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u8f93\u51fa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u662f\u975e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u7684\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u6b65\u9aa4\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9636\u6bb5\u76f8\u4e92\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002\u65e0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u6709\u9650\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7b56\u7565\u867d\u7136\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5c06\u7ecf\u5178\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982\u7b56\u7565\u8fed\u4ee3\uff09\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u6b64\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4ecd\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5355\u8c03\u6539\u8fdb\u7b56\u7565\u8fed\u4ee3\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bb6\u65cf\uff0c\u4ea4\u66ff\u6267\u884c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u5355\u9636\u6bb5\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u548c\u653f\u7b56\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u6839\u636e\u9884\u5b9a\u7684\u5468\u671f\u6027\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u53d8\u4f53\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u4f30\u8ba1\u4ef7\u503c\u5e76\u5b66\u4e60\u65e0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb6\u65cf\u5177\u6709\u6700\u5927\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u6307\u6807\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u6700\u5c0f\u5468\u671f\u7684\u6700\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u5728\u591a\u4e2aPOMDP\u793a\u4f8b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u548c\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6bd4\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u57fa\u7ebf\u548c\u6700\u8fd1\u4e13\u95e8\u7b97\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5bb6\u65cf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5728POMDP\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u65e0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u548c\u6709\u9650\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u4e8e\u548c\u65e0\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

This paper presents the first systematic comparison of classical optimization and AI approaches to this problem, evaluating their performance against traditional algorithms.

However, the global denoising dynamics of DMs inherently conflate local editing targets with the full-image context, leading to unintended modifications in non-target regions. In this paper, we shift our attention beyond DMs and turn to Masked Generative Transformers (MGTs) as an alternative approach to tackle this challenge. By predicting multiple masked tokens rather than holistic refinement, MGTs exhibit a localized decoding paradigm that endows them with the inherent capacity to explicitly preserve non-relevant regions during the editing process. Building upon this insight, we introduce the first MGT-based image editing framework, termed EditMGT. We first demonstrate that MGT's cross-attention maps provide informative localization signals for localizing edit-relevant regions and devise a multi-layer attention consolidation scheme that refines these maps to achieve fine-grained and precise localization. On top of these adaptive localization results, we introduce region-hold sampling, which restricts token flipping within low-attention areas to suppress spurious edits, thereby confining modifications to the intended target regions and preserving the integrity of surrounding non-target areas. To train EditMGT, we construct CrispEdit-2M, a high-resolution dataset spanning seven diverse editing categories. Without introducing additional parameters, we adapt a pre-trained text-to-image MGT into an image editing model through attention injection. Extensive experiments across four standard benchmarks demonstrate that, with fewer than 1B parameters, our model achieves similarity performance while enabling 6 times faster editing. Moreover, it delivers comparable or superior editing quality, with improvements of 3.6% and 17.6% on style change and style transfer tasks, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86EditMGT\uff0c\u9996\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eMasked Generative Transformers (MGTs)\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u89e3\u7801\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u533a\u57df\u63a7\u5236\u91c7\u6837\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b06\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u867d\u7136\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5168\u5c40\u53bb\u566a\u52a8\u6001\u4f1a\u5c06\u5c40\u90e8\u7f16\u8f91\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u5168\u56fe\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u533a\u57df\u88ab\u610f\u5916\u4fee\u6539\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u8f6c\u5411Masked Generative Transformers\u4f5c\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5176\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u89e3\u7801\u7279\u6027\u6765\u4fdd\u7559\u975e\u76f8\u5173\u533a\u57df\u3002", "method": "1) \u5229\u7528MGT\u7684\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u56fe\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4fe1\u53f7\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u591a\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6574\u5408\u65b9\u6848\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff1b2) \u63d0\u51fa\u533a\u57df\u4fdd\u6301\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u533a\u57df\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u7ffb\u8f6c\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u865a\u5047\u7f16\u8f91\uff1b3) \u6784\u5efaCrispEdit-2M\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b4) \u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6ce8\u5165\u5c06\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cfMGT\u9002\u914d\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u53c2\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6807\u51c6\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff1a1) \u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u5c11\u4e8e10\u4ebf\uff1b2) \u4fdd\u6301\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u6027\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b06\u500d\u7f16\u8f91\u52a0\u901f\uff1b3) \u5728\u98ce\u683c\u53d8\u66f4\u548c\u98ce\u683c\u8fc1\u79fb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u63d0\u53473.6%\u548c17.6%\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b4) \u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u6bd4\u8f83\u6216\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "EditMGT\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06MGTs\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u5316\u7279\u6027\u548c\u533a\u57df\u63a7\u5236\u91c7\u6837\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5c40\u90e8\u7f16\u8f91\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

In contrast, we propose VGent, a modular encoder-decoder architecture that explicitly disentangles high-level reasoning and low-level bounding box prediction. Specifically, a frozen MLLM serves as the encoder to provide untouched powerful reasoning capabilities, while a decoder takes high-quality boxes proposed by detectors as queries and selects target box(es) via cross-attending on encoder's hidden states. This design fully leverages advances in both object detection and MLLM, avoids the pitfalls of auto-regressive decoding, and enables fast inference. Moreover, it supports modular upgrades of both the encoder and decoder to benefit the whole system: we introduce (i) QuadThinker, an RL-based training paradigm for enhancing multi-target reasoning ability of the encoder; (ii) mask-aware label for resolving detection-segmentation ambiguity; and (iii) global target recognition to improve the recognition of all the targets which benefits the selection among augmented proposals. Experiments on multi-target visual grounding benchmarks show that VGent achieves a new state-of-the-art with +20.6% F1 improvement over prior methods, and further boosts gIoU by +8.2% and cIoU by +5.8% under visual reference challenges, while maintaining constant, fast inference latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this study, we propose an information-driven, intelligent fusion strategy for integrating multiple pathology FMs into a unified representation and systematically evaluate its performance for cancer grading and staging across three distinct diseases. Diagnostic H&E whole-slide images from kidney (519 slides), prostate (490 slides), and rectal (200 slides) cancers were dichotomized into low versus high grade or stage. Both tile-level FMs (Conch v1.5, MUSK, Virchow2, H-Optimus1, Prov-Gigapath) and slide-level FMs (TITAN, CHIEF, MADELEINE) were considered to train downstream classifiers. We then evaluated three FM fusion schemes at both tile and slide levels: majority-vote ensembling, naive feature concatenation, and intelligent fusion based on correlation-guided pruning of redundant features. Under patient-stratified cross-validation with hold-out testing, intelligent fusion of tile-level embeddings yielded consistent gains in classification performance across all three cancers compared with the best single FMs and naive fusion. Global similarity metrics revealed substantial alignment of FM embedding spaces, contrasted by lower local neighborhood agreement, indicating complementary fine-grained information across FMs. Attention maps showed that intelligent fusion yielded concentrated attention on tumor regions while reducing spurious focus on benign regions.

However, current ECG models are trained under the assumption of clean and non-ambiguous annotations, which limits both the development and the meaningful evaluation of models under real-world conditions. Although Partial Label Learning (PLL) frameworks are designed to learn from ambiguous labels, their effectiveness in medical time-series domains, ECG in particular, remains largely unexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study of PLL methods for ECG diagnosis. We adapt nine PLL algorithms to multi-label ECG diagnosis and evaluate them using a diverse set of clinically motivated ambiguity generation strategies, capturing both unstructured (e.g., random) and structured ambiguities (e.g., cardiologist-derived similarities, treatment relationships, and diagnostic taxonomies). Our experiments on the PTB-XL and Chapman datasets demonstrate that PLL methods vary substantially in their robustness to different types and degrees of ambiguity. Through extensive analysis, we identify key limitations of current PLL approaches in clinical settings and outline future directions for developing robust and clinically aligned ambiguity-aware learning frameworks for ECG diagnosis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u90e8\u5206\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728ECG\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u79cd\u4e34\u5e8a\u6b67\u4e49\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e0d\u540cPLL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6b67\u4e49\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5dee\u5f02\u663e\u8457\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u5b9eECG\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u6807\u7b7e\u6b67\u4e49\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u5982\u75c5\u60c5\u91cd\u53e0\u3001\u8bca\u65ad\u5206\u6b67\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709ECG\u6a21\u578b\u5747\u5047\u8bbe\u6807\u6ce8\u5b8c\u5168\u5e72\u51c0\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u53cd\u6620\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u9645\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u800c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6b67\u4e49\u6807\u7b7e\u7684PLL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728ECG\u9886\u57df\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u4e5d\u79cdPLL\u7b97\u6cd5\u9002\u914d\u4e8e\u591a\u6807\u7b7eECG\u8bca\u65ad\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u79cd\u4e34\u5e8a\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u6b67\u4e49\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u5305\u62ec\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u968f\u673a\u6b67\u4e49\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6b67\u4e49\uff09\uff0c\u5728PTB-XL\u548cChapman\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u4e0d\u540cPLL\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u6b67\u4e49\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0e\u4e34\u5e8a\u5b9e\u9645\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u6b67\u4e49\u7684ECG\u8bca\u65ad\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027ECG\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u6307\u5f15\u3002"}}

As a part of the framework, we introduce over 200k samples spanning 7 major categories: demographics, age, educational grade level, dialect, formality, political leaning, and topic. We also generated synthetic versions of each sample with carefully crafted prompts to preserve the original content while reflecting subgroup-specific writing styles. Using this, we evaluate four open-source state-of-the-art AI text detectors and find consistent disparities in detection performance, particularly low recall rates for texts from underrepresented groups.

However, pedestrians can become occluded by vehicles or infrastructure, creating significant safety risks due to limited visibility. Vehicle-to-everything communication enables the sharing of perception data between connected road-users, allowing for a more comprehensive awareness. The main challenge is how to fuse perception data when measurements are inconsistent with the true locations of pedestrians. Inconsistent measurements can occur due to sensor noise, false positives, or communication issues. This paper employs set-based estimation with constrained zonotopes to compute a confidence metric for the measurement set from each sensor. These sets and their confidences are then fused using hybrid zonotopes. This method can account for inconsistent measurements, enabling reliable and robust fusion of the sensor data.

We employ a divide-and-conquer acceleration strategy with three components: (1) knowledge distillation to compress the hybrid backbone into a single efficient student; (2) blockwise neural architecture search for automatically discovering optimal cost filtering designs under latency budgets, reducing search complexity exponentially; and (3) structured pruning for eliminating redundancy in the iterative refinement module. Furthermore, we introduce an automatic pseudo-labeling pipeline used to curate 1.4M in-the-wild stereo pairs to supplement synthetic training data and facilitate knowledge distillation.

We employed a cross-sectional analysis design based on standardized medical probes, selecting four mainstream LLMs as research subjects: GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5, DeepSeek 3.1, and Qwen3-Max. An evaluation system comprising twenty medical probes across five core dimensions was used to simulate a genuine clinical communication environment. All probes had gold-standard answers defined by clinical experts and were assessed via a double-blind, inverse rating scale by two independent clinicians. The results show that all tested models exhibited functional defects to varying degrees, with Qwen3-Max demonstrating the best overall performance and Gemini 2.5 the worst. Under conditions of extreme noise, most models experienced a functional collapse. Notably, GPT-4o made a severe misjudgment in the risk assessment for pulmonary embolism (PE) secondary to deep vein thrombosis (DVT). This research is the first to empirically confirm that LLMs exhibit features resembling metabolic dysfunction when processing clinical information, proposing the innovative concept of \"AI-Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (AI-MASLD)\".

However, many visual domains, especially non-object-centric domains such as medical imaging and remote sensing, contain itemized text annotations: multiple text items describing distinct and semantically independent findings within a single image.

Here, we introduce ItemizedCLIP, a framework for learning complete and explainable visual representations from itemized text supervision. ItemizedCLIP employs a cross-attention module to produce text item-conditioned visual embeddings and a set of tailored objectives that jointly enforce item independence (distinct regions for distinct items) and representation completeness (coverage of all items). Across four domains with naturally itemized text supervision (brain MRI, head CT, chest CT, remote sensing) and one additional synthetically itemized dataset, ItemizedCLIP achieves substantial improvements in zero-shot performance and fine-grained interpretability over baselines.

However, most existing studies assume unlimited public transit capacity or a fixed occupancy of shared modes, often neglecting waiting time and oversimplifying time-based costs by depending solely on in-vehicle travel time. These assumptions can overstate the system's performance with TCS regulation, especially when there are insufficient public or shared transport supplies.\n  To address this, we develop a dynamic multimodal equilibrium model to capture operation constraints and induced waiting times under TCS regulation. The model integrates travelers' mode choices, credit trading, traffic dynamics, and waiting time, which depend on key operational features of service vehicles such as fleet size and capacity.\n  Besides, most TCS studies assume fixed transport supply, overlooking supply-side responses triggered by demand shifts. Therefore, we further propose integrating adaptive supply management through the deployment of Demand-Responsive Autonomous Shuttles (DRAS) and developing a bi-level optimization framework that incorporates the equilibrium model to jointly optimize TCS design and operational strategies for the DRAS.\n  We apply the framework to a section of the A10 highway near Paris, France, to examine demand-supply interactions and assess the potential benefits of jointly implementing TCS and DRAS. Numerical results demonstrate the importance of modeling operational features within multimodal equilibrium and incorporating flexible supply in TCS policies for mitigating overall generalized cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, AI benchmarks are increasingly complex, requiring dynamic, AI-focused workflows. Rapid evolution in model architectures, scale, datasets, and deployment contexts makes evaluation a moving target. Large language models often memorize static benchmarks, causing a gap between benchmark results and real-world performance.\n  Beyond traditional static benchmarks, continuous adaptive benchmarking frameworks are needed to align scientific assessment with deployment risks. This calls for skills and education in AI Benchmark Carpentry. From our experience with MLCommons, educational initiatives, and programs like the DOE's Trillion Parameter Consortium, key barriers include high resource demands, limited access to specialized hardware, lack of benchmark design expertise, and uncertainty in relating results to application domains. Current benchmarks often emphasize peak performance on top-tier hardware, offering limited guidance for diverse, real-world scenarios.\n  Benchmarking must become dynamic, incorporating evolving models, updated data, and heterogeneous platforms while maintaining transparency, reproducibility, and interpretability. Democratization requires both technical innovation and systematic education across levels, building sustained expertise in benchmark design and use.

In this paper, we study a new and challenging setting of fairness-regularized smoothed online convex optimization with switching costs. First, to highlight the fundamental challenges introduced by the long-term fairness regularizer evaluated based on the entire sequence of actions, we prove that even without switching costs, no online algorithms can possibly achieve a sublinear regret or finite competitive ratio compared to the offline optimal algorithm as the problem episode length $T$ increases. Then, we propose FairOBD (Fairness-regularized Online Balanced Descent), which reconciles the tension between minimizing the hitting cost, switching cost, and fairness cost. Concretely, FairOBD decomposes the long-term fairness cost into a sequence of online costs by introducing an auxiliary variable and then leverages the auxiliary variable to regularize the online actions for fair outcomes. Based on a new approach to account for switching costs, we prove that FairOBD offers a worst-case asymptotic competitive ratio against a novel benchmark -- the optimal offline algorithm with parameterized constraints -- by considering $T\\to\\infty$. Finally, we run trace-driven experiments of dynamic computing resource provisioning for socially responsible AI inference to empirically evaluate FairOBD, showing that FairOBD can effectively reduce the total fairness-regularized cost and better promote fair outcomes compared to existing baseline solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Still, in such a formulation, as the number of vehicles involved increases, the computational complexity increases significantly. To address this, we propose two algorithms for near-optimal local optimization that significantly reduce the computational complexity by decomposing the high-dimensional problem into a sequence of 2D graph search problems.

In this paper, we propose a Lightweight 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) Compression method based on Video codec (LGSCV). First, a two-stage Morton scan is proposed to generate blockwise 2D maps that are friendly for canonical video codecs in which the coding units (CU) are square blocks. A 3D Morton scan is used to permute GS primitives, followed by a 2D Morton scan to map the ordered GS primitives to 2D maps in a blockwise style. However, although the blockwise 2D maps report close performance to the PLAS map in high-bitrate regions, they show a quality collapse at medium-to-low bitrates. Therefore, a principal component analysis (PCA) is used to reduce the dimensionality of spherical harmonics (SH), and a MiniPLAS, which is flexible and fast, is designed to permute the primitives within certain block sizes. Incorporating SH PCA and MiniPLAS leads to a significant gain in rate-distortion (RD) performance, especially at medium and low bitrates. MiniPLAS can also guide the setting of the codec CU size configuration and significantly reduce encoding time. Experimental results on the MPEG dataset demonstrate that the proposed LGSCV achieves over 20% RD gain compared with state-of-the-art methods, while reducing 2D map generation time to approximately 1 second and cutting encoding time by 50%.

When these connections differ, the resulting trajectory discrepancy--termed the Latent Error Dynamic Response (LEDR)--acquires an intrinsic dynamical structure governed by curvature. We show that the LEDR satisfies a Jacobi-type equation, where curvature mismatch acts as an explicit forcing term. In the important case of a flat model connection, the LEDR reduces to a classical Jacobi field on the true manifold, causing Model Error Resonance (MER) to emerge under positive sectional curvature.

Tasks such as drug recommendation, treatment planning, and adverse-effect prediction demand robust, multi-step reasoning grounded in reliable biomedical knowledge. Agentic AI methods, exemplified by TxAgent, address these challenges through iterative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). TxAgent employs a fine-tuned Llama-3.1-8B model that dynamically generates and executes function calls to a unified biomedical tool suite (ToolUniverse), integrating FDA Drug API, OpenTargets, and Monarch resources to ensure access to current therapeutic information. In contrast to general-purpose RAG systems, medical applications impose stringent safety constraints, rendering the accuracy of both the reasoning trace and the sequence of tool invocations critical. These considerations motivate evaluation protocols treating token-level reasoning and tool-usage behaviors as explicit supervision signals. This work presents insights derived from our participation in the CURE-Bench NeurIPS 2025 Challenge, which benchmarks therapeutic-reasoning systems using metrics that assess correctness, tool utilization, and reasoning quality. We analyze how retrieval quality for function (tool) calls influences overall model performance and demonstrate performance gains achieved through improved tool-retrieval strategies.

Dimensionality reduction techniques and autoencoders are powerful tools for extracting features, but they often struggle with such high-dimensional data. This paper presents an enhanced autoencoder framework that incorporates a clustering loss, based on the soft silhouette score, alongside a contrastive loss to improve the visualization and interpretability of ensemble datasets. First, EfficientNetV2 is used to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled portions of the scientific ensemble datasets. By jointly optimizing the reconstruction, clustering, and contrastive objectives, our method encourages similar data points to group together while separating distinct clusters in the latent space. UMAP is subsequently applied to this latent representation to produce 2D projections, which are evaluated using the silhouette score. Multiple types of autoencoders are evaluated and compared based on their ability to extract meaningful features. Experiments on two scientific ensemble datasets - channel structures in soil derived from Markov chain Monte Carlo, and droplet-on-film impact dynamics - show that models incorporating clustering or contrastive loss marginally outperform the baseline approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6f\u8f6e\u5ed3\u5206\u6570\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u635f\u5931\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u79d1\u5b66\u96c6\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u964d\u7ef4\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7ef4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u96c6\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5728\u5206\u6790\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u964d\u7ef4\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5bf9\u6b64\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528EfficientNetV2\u4e3a\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u79d1\u5b66\u96c6\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u751f\u6210\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u91cd\u6784\u635f\u5931\u3001\u805a\u7c7b\u635f\u5931\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f6f\u8f6e\u5ed3\u5206\u6570\uff09\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\uff1b3. \u901a\u8fc7\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u4fc3\u4f7f\u76f8\u4f3c\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u805a\u96c6\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u7c07\u5206\u79bb\uff1b4. \u5c06UMAP\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u751f\u62102D\u6295\u5f71\uff1b5. \u4f7f\u7528\u8f6e\u5ed3\u5206\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u6295\u5f71\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e24\u79cd\u79d1\u5b66\u96c6\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u57fa\u4e8e\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u94fe\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u7684\u571f\u58e4\u901a\u9053\u7ed3\u6784\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6db2\u6ef4\u5728\u8584\u819c\u4e0a\u7684\u649e\u51fb\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u805a\u7c7b\u635f\u5931\u6216\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u7565\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u51c6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u589e\u5f3a\u578b\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u79d1\u5b66\u96c6\u6210\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u7684\u8054\u5408\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Traditional formal verification tools fall short when faced with systems that embed both opaque, black-box AI components and complex stochastic dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce LUCID (Learning-enabled Uncertainty-aware Certification of stochastIc Dynamical systems), a verification engine for certifying safety of black-box stochastic dynamical systems from a finite dataset of random state transitions. As such, LUCID is the first known tool capable of establishing quantified safety guarantees for such systems. Thanks to its modular architecture and extensive documentation, LUCID is designed for easy extensibility. LUCID employs a data-driven methodology rooted in control barrier certificates, which are learned directly from system transition data, to ensure formal safety guarantees. We use conditional mean embeddings to embed data into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), where an RKHS ambiguity set is constructed that can be inflated to robustify the result to out-of-distribution behavior. A key innovation within LUCID is its use of a finite Fourier kernel expansion to reformulate a semi-infinite non-convex optimization problem into a tractable linear program. The resulting spectral barrier allows us to leverage the fast Fourier transform to generate the relaxed problem efficiently, offering a scalable yet distributionally robust framework for verifying safety. LUCID thus offers a robust and efficient verification framework, able to handle the complexities of modern black-box systems while providing formal guarantees of safety. These unique capabilities are demonstrated on challenging benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

With the emergence of 3D generation, this task has undergone a transformative impact, shifting not only from visual fidelity to functional utility but also enabling editable CAD designs. Prior works have achieved early success in single-part CAD generation, which is not well-suited for real-world applications, as multiple parts need to be assembled under semantic and geometric constraints. In this paper, we propose CADKnitter, a compositional CAD generation framework with a geometry-guided diffusion sampling strategy. CADKnitter is able to generate a complementary CAD part that follows both the geometric constraints of the given CAD model and the semantic constraints of the desired design text prompt. We also curate a dataset, so-called KnitCAD, containing over 310,000 samples of CAD models, along with textual prompts and assembly metadata that provide semantic and geometric constraints.

However, city-level data often exists in heterogeneous formats, collected independently by local agencies with diverse objectives and standards. Despite their numerous, wide-ranging, and uniformly consumable nature, national-level datasets exhibit significant heterogeneity and multi-modality. This research proposes a heterogeneous data pipeline that performs cross-domain data fusion over time-varying, spatial-varying and spatial-varying time-series datasets. We aim to address complex urban problems across multiple domains and localities by harnessing the rich information over 50 data sources. Specifically, our data-learning module integrates homophily from spatial-varying dataset into graph-learning, embedding information of various localities into models.

A promising solution is inference-time alignment, which optimizes the noise space to improve sample fidelity without updating model parameters. Yet, optimization- or search-based methods are computationally impractical for AR-VDMs. Recent text-to-image (T2I) works address this via feedforward noise refiners that modulate sampled noises in a single forward pass.

In this work, we introduce a benchmark, called SmokeBench, to evaluate the ability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to recognize and localize wildfire smoke in images. The benchmark consists of four tasks: (1) smoke classification, (2) tile-based smoke localization, (3) grid-based smoke localization, and (4) smoke detection. We evaluate several MLLMs, including Idefics2, Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL3, Unified-IO 2, Grounding DINO, GPT-4o, and Gemini-2.5 Pro. Our results show that while some models can classify the presence of smoke when it covers a large area, all models struggle with accurate localization, especially in the early stages. Further analysis reveals that smoke volume is strongly correlated with model performance, whereas contrast plays a comparatively minor role. These findings highlight critical limitations of current MLLMs for safety-critical wildfire monitoring and underscore the need for methods that improve early-stage smoke localization.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The natural progression has been toward larger, more comprehensive and challenging collections of static problems, an approach that inadvertently constrains the kinds of advances we can measure and incentivize. To address this limitation, we argue for progress-oriented benchmarks, problem environments whose objectives are themselves the core targets of scientific progress, so that achieving state of the art on the benchmark advances the field. As a introductory step, we instantiate an environment based on the NanoGPT speedrun. The environment standardizes a dataset slice, a reference model and training harness, and rich telemetry, with run-time verification and anti-gaming checks. Evaluation centers on the scientific delta achieved: best-attained loss and the efficiency frontier. Using this environment, we achieve a new state-of-the-art training time, improving upon the previous record by 3 seconds, and qualitatively observe the emergence of novel algorithmic ideas. Moreover, comparisons between models and agents remain possible, but they are a means, not the end; the benchmark's purpose is to catalyze reusable improvements to the language modeling stack. With this release, the overarching goal is to seed a community shift from static problem leaderboards to test-time research on open-ended yet measurable scientific problems.

Bayesian optimization, a widely used black-box and sample-efficient learning method, constructs a probabilistic surrogate of the closed-loop performance from few experiments and uses it to select informative controller parameters. However, it typically struggles with dense high-dimensional controller parameterizations, as they may appear, for example, in tuning model predictive controllers, because standard surrogate models fail to capture the structure of such spaces. This work suggests that the use of Bayesian neural networks as surrogate models may help to mitigate this limitation. Through a comparison between Gaussian processes with Matern kernels, finite-width Bayesian neural networks, and infinite-width Bayesian neural networks on a cart-pole task, we find that Bayesian neural network surrogate models achieve faster and more reliable convergence of the closed-loop cost and enable successful optimization of parameterizations with hundreds of dimensions. Infinite-width Bayesian neural networks also maintain performance in settings with more than one thousand parameters, whereas Matern-kernel Gaussian processes rapidly lose effectiveness. These results indicate that Bayesian neural network surrogate models may be suitable for learning dense high-dimensional controller parameterizations and offer practical guidance for selecting surrogate models in learning-based controller design.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Many recent methods represent the world through images, and reduce forecasting to stochastic video generation. Although such methods excel at realism and visual fidelity, predicting pixels is computationally intensive and not directly useful in many applications, as it requires translating RGB into signals useful for decision making. An alternative approach uses features from vision foundation models (VFMs) as world representations, performing deterministic regression to predict future world states. These features can be directly translated into actionable signals such as semantic segmentation and depth, while remaining computationally efficient. However, deterministic regression averages over multiple plausible futures, undermining forecast accuracy by failing to capture uncertainty. To address this crucial limitation, we introduce a generative forecaster that performs autoregressive flow matching in VFM feature space. Our key insight is that generative modeling in this space requires encoding VFM features into a compact latent space suitable for diffusion. We show that this latent space preserves information more effectively than previously used PCA-based alternatives, both for forecasting and other applications, such as image generation. Our latent predictions can be easily decoded into multiple useful and interpretable output modalities: semantic segmentation, depth, surface normals, and even RGB. With matched architecture and compute, our method produces sharper and more accurate predictions than regression across all modalities. Our results suggest that stochastic conditional generation of VFM features offers a promising and scalable foundation for future world models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Like any machine learning problem, the choice of activation function influences the characteristics and performance of the solution obtained from physics-informed training. Several studies have compared common activation functions on benchmark differential equations, and have unanimously found that the rectified linear unit (ReLU) is outperformed by competitors such as the sigmoid, hyperbolic tangent, and swish activation functions. In this work, we diagnose the poor performance of ReLU on physics-informed machine learning problems. While it is well-known that the piecewise linear form of ReLU prevents it from being used on second-order differential equations, we show that ReLU fails even on variational problems involving only first derivatives. We identify the cause of this failure as second derivatives of the activation, which are taken not in the formulation of the loss, but in the process of training. Namely, we show that automatic differentiation in PyTorch fails to characterize derivatives of discontinuous fields, which causes the gradient of the physics-informed loss to be mis-specified, thus explaining the poor performance of ReLU.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, exclusive reliance on the current scene for motion planning may result in suboptimal responses in highly dynamic traffic environments where ego actions further alter the future scene. To model the evolution of future scenes, we leverage the World Model to represent how the ego vehicle and its environment interact and change over time, which entails complex reasoning. The Chain of Thought (CoT) offers a promising solution by forecasting a sequence of future thoughts that subsequently guide trajectory refinement. In this paper, we propose FutureX, a CoT-driven pipeline that enhances end-to-end planners to perform complex motion planning via future scene latent reasoning and trajectory refinement. Specifically, the Auto-think Switch examines the current scene and decides whether additional reasoning is required to yield a higher-quality motion plan. Once FutureX enters the Thinking mode, the Latent World Model conducts a CoT-guided rollout to predict future scene representation, enabling the Summarizer Module to further refine the motion plan. Otherwise, FutureX operates in an Instant mode to generate motion plans in a forward pass for relatively simple scenes.

While conventional dememorization techniques, such as regularization and data filtering, limit overfitting to specific training examples, they fail to systematically prevent the internalization of prohibited concept-level features. Simply discarding all images containing a sensitive feature wastes invaluable training data, necessitating a method for selective unlearning at the concept level.\n  To address this, we introduce a Gradient Projection Framework designed to enforce a stringent requirement of concept-level feature exclusion. Our defense operates during backpropagation by systematically identifying and excising training signals aligned with embeddings of prohibited attributes. Specifically, we project each gradient update onto the orthogonal complement of the sensitive feature's embedding space, thereby zeroing out its influence on the model's weights. Our method integrates seamlessly into standard diffusion model training pipelines and complements existing defenses. We analyze our method against an adversary aiming for feature extraction. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our framework drastically reduces memorization while rigorously preserving generation quality and semantic fidelity. By reframing memorization control as selective learning, our approach establishes a new paradigm for IP-safe and privacy-preserving generative AI.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, the slow inference speeds and non-autoregressive paradigms severely constrain the application of diffusion-based THG models. In this study, we propose REST, the first diffusion-based, real-time, end-to-end streaming audio-driven talking head generation framework. To support real-time end-to-end generation, a compact video latent space is first learned through high spatiotemporal VAE compression. Additionally, to enable autoregressive streaming within the compact video latent space, we introduce an ID-Context Cache mechanism, which integrates ID-Sink and Context-Cache principles to key-value caching for maintaining temporal consistency and identity coherence during long-time streaming generation. Furthermore, an Asynchronous Streaming Distillation (ASD) training strategy is proposed to mitigate error accumulation in autoregressive generation and enhance temporal consistency, which leverages a non-streaming teacher with an asynchronous noise schedule to supervise the training of the streaming student model. REST bridges the gap between autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches, demonstrating substantial value for applications requiring real-time talking head generation.

Then, a fewer-step appearance distillation strategy is proposed to eliminate appearance redundancy in the denoising process, greatly improving inference efficiency. Finally, we introduce an autoregressive micro-chunk streaming generation paradigm equipped with a sliding training strategy and a historical keyframe mechanism to enable low-latency and stable long-term video generation.

An Experimental Comparison with Vision Transformers", "comment": null, "summary": "Transformers have recently demonstrated strong performance in computer vision, with Vision Transformers (ViTs) leveraging self-attention to capture both low-level and high-level image features.

By combining patch-based tokenization with locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) attention, our model approximates global self-attention while reducing its theoretical time complexity from $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log n)$ in the sequence length $n$. We evaluate the proposed Reformer-based vision model on CIFAR-10 to assess its behavior on small-scale datasets, on ImageNet-100 to study its accuracy--efficiency trade-off in a more realistic setting, and on a high-resolution medical imaging dataset to evaluate the model under longer token sequences.\n  While the Reformer achieves higher accuracy on CIFAR-10 compared to our ViT-style baseline, the ViT model consistently outperforms the Reformer in our experiments in terms of practical efficiency and end-to-end computation time across the larger and higher-resolution settings.

Serrated tussock (\\textit{Nassella trichotoma}) is a highly competitive invasive grass species that disrupts native grasslands, reduces pasture productivity, and increases land management costs. In Victoria, Australia, it presents a major challenge due to its aggressive spread and ecological impact. While current ground surveys and subsequent management practices are effective at small scales, they are not feasible for landscape-scale monitoring. Although aerial imagery offers high spatial resolution suitable for detailed classification, its high cost limits scalability. Satellite-based remote sensing provides a more cost-effective and scalable alternative, though often with lower spatial resolution. This study evaluates whether multi-temporal Sentinel-2 imagery, despite its lower spatial resolution, can provide a comparable and cost-effective alternative for landscape-scale monitoring of serrated tussock by leveraging its higher spectral resolution and seasonal phenological information. A total of eleven models have been developed using various combinations of spectral bands, texture features, vegetation indices, and seasonal data. Using a random forest classifier, the best-performing Sentinel-2 model (M76*) has achieved an Overall Accuracy (OA) of 68\\% and an Overall Kappa (OK) of 0.55, slightly outperforming the best-performing aerial imaging model's OA of 67\\% and OK of 0.52 on the same dataset.

To address these limitations, we introduce \\textbf{FilmWeaver}, a novel framework designed to generate consistent, multi-shot videos of arbitrary length. First, it employs an autoregressive diffusion paradigm to achieve arbitrary-length video generation. To address the challenge of consistency, our key insight is to decouple the problem into inter-shot consistency and intra-shot coherence. We achieve this through a dual-level cache mechanism: a shot memory caches keyframes from preceding shots to maintain character and scene identity, while a temporal memory retains a history of frames from the current shot to ensure smooth, continuous motion. The proposed framework allows for flexible, multi-round user interaction to create multi-shot videos. Furthermore, due to this decoupled design, our method demonstrates high versatility by supporting downstream tasks such as multi-concept injection and video extension. To facilitate the training of our consistency-aware method, we also developed a comprehensive pipeline to construct a high-quality multi-shot video dataset. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches on metrics for both consistency and aesthetic quality, opening up new possibilities for creating more consistent, controllable, and narrative-driven video content.

Their potential exposure to external world makes them susceptible to cyber-attacks. Existing detection methods against controller logic attacks use either specification-based or learnt models. However, specification-based models require experts' manual efforts or access to PLC's source code, while machine learning-based models often fall short of providing explanation for their decisions. We design SRLR -- a it Symbolic Regression based Logic Recovery} solution to identify the logic of a PLC based only on its inputs and outputs. The recovered logic is used to generate explainable rules for detecting controller logic attacks. SRLR enhances the latest deep symbolic regression methods using the following ICS-specific properties: (1) some important ICS control logic is best represented in frequency domain rather than time domain; (2) an ICS controller can operate in multiple modes, each using different logic, where mode switches usually do not happen frequently; (3) a robust controller usually filters out outlier inputs as ICS sensor data can be noisy; and (4) with the above factors captured, the degree of complexity of the formulas is reduced, making effective search possible. Thanks to these enhancements, SRLR consistently outperforms all existing methods in a variety of ICS settings that we evaluate. In terms of the recovery accuracy, SRLR's gain can be as high as 39% in some challenging environment. We also evaluate SRLR on a distribution grid containing hundreds of voltage regulators, demonstrating its stability in handling large-scale, complex systems with varied configurations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Traditional autoencoder-based methods often struggle with incomplete anomaly suppression and loss of fine details, as their single-pass decoding fails to effectively handle anomalies with varying severity and scale. We propose a recursive architecture for autoencoder (RcAE), which performs reconstruction iteratively to progressively suppress anomalies while refining normal structures. Unlike traditional single-pass models, this recursive design naturally produces a sequence of reconstructions, progressively exposing suppressed abnormal patterns. To leverage this reconstruction dynamics, we introduce a Cross Recursion Detection (CRD) module that tracks inconsistencies across recursion steps, enhancing detection of both subtle and large-scale anomalies. Additionally, we incorporate a Detail Preservation Network (DPN) to recover high-frequency textures typically lost during reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing non-diffusion methods, and achieves performance on par with recent diffusion models with only 10% of their parameters and offering substantially faster inference.

Here, we propose Quantum Golay code Error Correction (QGEC), a QEC method using Golay code, which is an efficient coding method in classical information theory. We investigated our method's ability in decoding calculations with the Transformer. We evaluated the accuracy of the decoder in a code space defined by the generative polynomials with three different weights sets and three noise models with different correlations of bit-flip error and phase-flip error. Furthermore, under a noise model following a discrete uniform distribution, we compared the decoding performance of Transformer decoders with identical architectures trained respectively on Golay and toric codes. The results showed that the noise model with the smaller correlation gave better accuracy, while the weights of the generative polynomials had little effect on the accuracy of the decoder. In addition, they showed that Golay code requiring 23 data qubits and having a code distance of 7 achieved higher decoding accuracy than toric code which requiring 50 data qubits and having a code distance of 5. This suggests that implementing quantum error correction using a Transformer may enable the Golay code to realize fault-tolerant quantum computation more efficiently.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u7ecf\u5178\u7406\u8bba\u4e2d\u9ad8\u6548\u7684Golay\u7801\u8fdb\u884c\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5(QGEC)\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u67b6\u6784\u5f00\u53d1\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aGolay\u7801\u5728\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u6570\u66f4\u5c11\u3001\u7801\u8ddd\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73af\u9762\u7801\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4\u7ecf\u5178\u8ba1\u7b97\u673a\u6709\u663e\u8457\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u6613\u53d7\u5916\u90e8\u566a\u58f0\u5e72\u6270\u3002\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519(QEC)\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u8be5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5b9e\u9645\u9519\u8bef\u901a\u8fc7\u7a33\u5b9a\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u5143\u6d4b\u91cf\u800c\u975e\u76f4\u63a5\u6d4b\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u3002\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5c06\u7ecf\u5178\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u9ad8\u6548Golay\u7801\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eQEC\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faQuantum Golay code Error Correction(QGEC)\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Transformer\u6784\u5efa\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u3002\u5728\u7531\u751f\u6210\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u7801\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u6743\u91cd\u96c6\u548c\u4e09\u4e2a\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u6bd4\u7279\u7ffb\u8f6c\u4e0e\u76f8\u4f4d\u7ffb\u8f6c\u8bef\u5dee\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u7684Transformer\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5728Golay\u7801\u548c\u73af\u9762\u7801\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "1. \u566a\u58f0\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7ed9\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff1b2.\u751f\u6210\u591a\u9879\u5f0f\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u5bf9\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5f71\u54cd\u751a\u5fae\uff1b3.Golay\u7801(\u9700\u898123\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\uff0c\u7801\u8ddd7)\u6bd4\u73af\u9762\u7801(\u9700\u898150\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\uff0c\u7801\u8ddd5)\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u89e3\u7801\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7Transformer\u5b9e\u73b0\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u4f7fGolay\u7801\u80fd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bb9\u9519\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002Golay\u7801\u5728\u66f4\u5c11\u91cf\u5b50\u6bd4\u7279\u8d44\u6e90\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u73af\u9762\u7801\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7ecf\u5178\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u7ea0\u9519\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

However, existing video autoencoders often entangle spatial and temporal information, limiting their ability to capture temporal consistency and leading to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose Autoregressive Video Autoencoder (ARVAE), which compresses and reconstructs each frame conditioned on its predecessor in an autoregressive manner, allowing flexible processing of videos with arbitrary lengths. ARVAE introduces a temporal-spatial decoupled representation that combines downsampled flow field for temporal coherence with spatial relative compensation for newly emerged content, achieving high compression efficiency without information loss. Specifically, the encoder compresses the current and previous frames into the temporal motion and spatial supplement, while the decoder reconstructs the original frame from the latent representations given the preceding frame. A multi-stage training strategy is employed to progressively optimize the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARVAE achieves superior reconstruction quality with extremely lightweight models and small-scale training data.

However, most existing methods are tailored for LLMs, while MLLM-oriented unlearning remains at its early stage. Inspired by recent studies exploring the internal mechanisms of MLLMs, we propose to disentangle the visual and textual knowledge embedded within MLLMs and introduce a dedicated approach to selectively erase target visual knowledge while preserving textual knowledge. Unlike previous unlearning methods that rely on output-level supervision, our approach introduces a Visual Knowledge Distillation (VKD) scheme, which leverages intermediate visual representations within the MLLM as supervision signals. This design substantially enhances both unlearning effectiveness and model utility. Moreover, since our method only fine-tunes the visual components of the MLLM, it offers significant efficiency advantages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art unlearning methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency. Moreover, we are the first to evaluate the robustness of MLLM unlearning against relearning attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, this process is hindered by low-quality input data caused by onboard sensors limited capability and frequent occlusions, leading to incomplete, noisy, or missing data, and thus reduced mapping accuracy and robustness. Recent efforts have introduced satellite images as auxiliary input, offering a stable, wide-area view to complement the limited ego perspective. However, satellite images in Bird's Eye View are often degraded by shadows and occlusions from vegetation and buildings. Prior methods using basic feature extraction and fusion remain ineffective. To address these challenges, we propose SATMapTR, a novel online map construction model that effectively fuses satellite image through two key components: (1) a gated feature refinement module that adaptively filters satellite image features by integrating high-level semantics with low-level structural cues to extract high signal-to-noise ratio map-relevant representations; and (2) a geometry-aware fusion module that consistently fuse satellite and BEV features at a grid-to-grid level, minimizing interference from irrelevant regions and low-quality inputs. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset show that SATMapTR achieves the highest mean average precision (mAP) of 73.8, outperforming state-of-the-art satellite-enhanced models by up to 14.2 mAP. It also shows lower mAP degradation under adverse weather and sensor failures, and achieves nearly 3 times higher mAP at extended perception ranges.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Traditional core loss modeling methods have limitations in prediction accuracy. To advance this field, the IEEE Power Electronics Society launched the MagNet Challenge in 2023, the first international competition focused on data-driven power electronics design methods, aiming to uncover complex loss patterns in magnetic components through a data-driven paradigm. Although purely data-driven models demonstrate strong fitting performance, their interpretability and cross-distribution generalization capabilities remain limited. To address these issues, this paper proposes a hybrid model, SEPI-TFPNet, which integrates empirical models with deep learning. The physical-prior submodule employs a spectral entropy discrimination mechanism to select the most suitable empirical model under different excitation waveforms. The data-driven submodule incorporates convolutional neural networks, multi-head attention mechanisms, and bidirectional long short-term memory networks to extract flux-density time-series features. An adaptive feature fusion module is introduced to improve multimodal feature interaction and integration. Using the MagNet dataset containing various magnetic materials, this paper evaluates the proposed method and compares it with 21 representative models from the 2023 challenge and three advanced methods from 2024-2025.

Rising accident rates raise concerns about traffic surveillance effectiveness. Traditional computer vision methods for accident detection struggle with limited spatiotemporal understanding and poor cross-domain generalization. Recent advances in transformer architectures excel at modeling global spatial-temporal dependencies and parallel computation. However, applying these models to automated traffic accident detection is limited by small, non-diverse datasets, hindering the development of robust, generalizable systems. To address this gap, we curated a comprehensive and balanced dataset that captures a wide spectrum of traffic environments, accident types, and contextual variations. Utilizing the curated dataset, we propose an accident detection model based on a transformer architecture using pre-extracted spatial video features. The architecture employs convolutional layers to extract local correlations across diverse patterns within a frame, while leveraging transformers to capture sequential-temporal dependencies among the retrieved features. Moreover, most existing studies neglect the integration of motion cues, which are essential for understanding dynamic scenes, especially during accidents. These approaches typically rely on static features or coarse temporal information. In this study, multiple methods for incorporating motion cues were evaluated to identify the most effective strategy. Among the tested input approaches, concatenating RGB features with optical flow achieved the highest accuracy at 88.3%.

KeyframeFace provides 2,100 expressive scripts paired with monocular videos, per-frame ARKit coefficients, contextual backgrounds, complex emotions, manually defined keyframes, and multi-perspective annotations based on ARKit coefficients and images via Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).

This design aligns the semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs with the interpretable structure of ARKit's coefficients, enabling high-fidelity expressive animation.

While steering these policies with reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising mechanism for fine-tuning beyond demonstration data, directly applying standard (non-equivariant) RL can be sample-inefficient and unstable, as it ignores the symmetries that EDPs are designed to exploit. In this paper, we theoretically establish that the diffusion process of an EDP is equivariant, which in turn induces a group-invariant latent-noise MDP that is well-suited for equivariant diffusion steering. Building on this theory, we introduce a principled symmetry-aware steering framework and compare standard, equivariant, and approximately equivariant RL strategies through comprehensive experiments across tasks with varying degrees of symmetry. While we identify the practical boundaries of strict equivariance under symmetry breaking, we show that exploiting symmetry during the steering process yields substantial benefits-enhancing sample efficiency, preventing value divergence, and achieving strong policy improvements even when EDPs are trained from extremely limited demonstrations.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, safety alignment under Reinforcement Learning (RL) often suffers from forgetting learned general abilities, which is also known as the alignment tax. To address this issue, we introduce Null-Space constrained Policy Optimization (NSPO), a novel RL framework for LLM safety alignment while preserving their core abilities. The safety policy gradients are geometrically projected into the null space of general tasks, thereby mitigating the safety alignment tax. In addition, we theoretically prove that NSPO preserves the model's original core capabilities, while still guaranteeing a descent direction for effective safety alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSPO outperforms existing methods by a large margin, achieving state-of-the-art safety performance without sacrificing accuracy on general tasks, including math, code, and instruction-following tasks. Notably, NSPO is data-efficient and only requires 40% of public human-annotated safety data from PKU-SafeRLHF to achieve promising safety performance, without a large amount of mixed general tasks data in existing alignment methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86NSPO\uff08\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u901a\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86LLM\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u79c0\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u4f26\u7406\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u9057\u5fd8\u5df2\u5b66\u5230\u7684\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\uff08\u5373\u5bf9\u9f50\u7a0e\u95ee\u9898\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86NSPO\uff08Null-Space constrained Policy Optimization\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5b89\u5168\u7b56\u7565\u68af\u5ea6\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u4e0a\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u901a\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u96f6\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4fdd\u8bc1\u6a21\u578b\u539f\u59cb\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\u4e0d\u88ab\u7834\u574f\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6709\u6548\u4e0b\u964d\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eNSPO\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u6307\u4ee4\u8ddf\u968f\u7b49\u901a\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u3002NSPO\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700PKU-SafeRLHF\u4e2d40%\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u6807\u6ce8\u5b89\u5168\u6570\u636e\u5373\u53ef\u8fbe\u5230\u826f\u597d\u5b89\u5168\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u6df7\u5408\u901a\u7528\u4efb\u52a1\u6570\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "NSPO\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u79c0\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u5177\u6709\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In real-world settings, some anomalous events have lasting effects and influence the forecast, while others are short-lived and should be ignored.

We propose Co-TSFA (Contrastive Time Series Forecasting with Anomalies), a regularization framework that learns when to ignore anomalies and when to respond. Co-TSFA generates input-only and input-output augmentations to model forecast-irrelevant and forecast-relevant anomalies, and introduces a latent-output alignment loss that ties representation changes to forecast changes. This encourages invariance to irrelevant perturbations while preserving sensitivity to meaningful distributional shifts.

Specifically, the largest annotated multimodal dataset for dentistry to date was constructed by aggregating over 120k dental images paired with detailed descriptions that highlight diagnostically relevant visual features, making it the multimodal dataset with the most extensive collection of dental images to date. Training on this dataset significantly enhances the MLLM's visual understanding of dental conditions, while the subsequent reinforcement learning stage further strengthens its capability for multimodal complex reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations on intraoral and panoramic benchmarks, along with dental subsets of medical VQA benchmarks, show that DentalGPT achieves superior performance in disease classification and dental VQA tasks, outperforming many state-of-the-art MLLMs despite having only 7B parameters.

While Gaussian Blurring Mean Shift (GBMS) has proven effective for identifying arbitrarily shaped clusters in Euclidean space, it struggles with datasets exhibiting hierarchical or tree-like structures. In this work, we introduce HypeGBMS, a novel extension of GBMS to hyperbolic space. Our method replaces Euclidean computations with hyperbolic distances and employs M\u00f6bius-weighted means to ensure that all updates remain consistent with the geometry of the space. HypeGBMS effectively captures latent hierarchies while retaining the density-seeking behavior of GBMS. We provide theoretical insights into convergence and computational complexity, along with empirical results that demonstrate improved clustering quality in hierarchical datasets. This work bridges classical mean-shift clustering and hyperbolic representation learning, offering a principled approach to density-based clustering in curved spaces. Extensive experimental evaluations on $11$ real-world datasets demonstrate that HypeGBMS significantly outperforms conventional mean-shift clustering methods in non-Euclidean settings, underscoring its robustness and effectiveness.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this issue, we propose to process multiple frames from a satellite image time series of the same glacier in parallel and exchange temporal information between the corresponding feature maps to stabilize each prediction.

We introduce Atomic Action Slicing (AAS), a planner-aligned approach that decomposes long-horizon demonstrations into short, typed atomic actions that are easier for planners to use and policies to learn. Using LIBERO demonstrations, AAS produces a validated dataset of 2,124 atomic segments labeled with action type, temporal span, and confidence.

We present the first systematic security evaluation of these techniques, formalizing threat models that encompass both white- and black-box access and two attack goals: fingerprint removal, which erases identifying traces to evade attribution, and fingerprint forgery, which seeks to cause misattribution to a target model. We implement five attack strategies and evaluate 14 representative fingerprinting methods across RGB, frequency, and learned-feature domains on 12 state-of-the-art image generators. Our experiments reveal a pronounced gap between clean and adversarial performance. Removal attacks are highly effective, often achieving success rates above 80% in white-box settings and over 50% under constrained black-box access. While forgery is more challenging than removal, its success significantly varies across targeted models. We also identify a utility-robustness trade-off: methods with the highest attribution accuracy are often vulnerable to attacks. Although some techniques exhibit robustness in specific settings, none achieves high robustness and accuracy across all evaluated threat models. These findings highlight the need for techniques balancing robustness and accuracy, and identify the most promising approaches for advancing this goal.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u7eb9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u6d4b\u8bd514\u79cd\u6307\u7eb9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6e05\u6d01\u73af\u5883\u4e0e\u5bf9\u6297\u73af\u5883\u6027\u80fd\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u79fb\u9664\u653b\u51fb\u975e\u5e38\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f2a\u9020\u653b\u51fb\u96be\u5ea6\u8f83\u9ad8\u4f46\u6210\u529f\u7387\u56e0\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u800c\u5f02\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0e\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u65e0\u6280\u672f\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u7eb9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u867d\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8ffd\u8e2aAI\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u672f\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u5b58\u7591\u3002", "method": "\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e86\u767d\u76d2\u548c\u9ed1\u76d2\u4e24\u79cd\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u6307\u7eb9\u79fb\u9664\u548c\u6307\u7eb9\u4f2a\u9020\u4e24\u7c7b\u653b\u51fb\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e94\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u572812\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u5668\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e8614\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u6307\u7eb9\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8986\u76d6RGB\u3001\u9891\u7387\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u4e09\u5927\u57df\u3002", "result": "\u79fb\u9664\u653b\u51fb\u5728\u767d\u76d2\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u6210\u529f\u7387\u5e38\u8d85\u8fc780%\uff0c\u5728\u53d7\u9650\u5236\u7684\u9ed1\u76d2\u8bbf\u95ee\u4e0b\u4e5f\u8d85\u8fc750%\u3002\u4f2a\u9020\u653b\u51fb\u96be\u5ea6\u8f83\u5927\uff0c\u4f46\u6210\u529f\u7387\u968f\u76ee\u6807\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u6700\u9ad8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u5bf9\u653b\u51fb\u6700\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u65e0\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6240\u6709\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6307\u7eb9\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u5e73\u8861\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u6700\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u6280\u672f\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Current mainstream methods have made progress in cross-layer feature fusion, but two critical issues persist during the decoding stage. The first is insufficient cross-channel information interaction within the same-layer features, limiting feature expressiveness. The second is the inability to effectively co-model boundary and region information, making it difficult to accurately reconstruct complete regions and sharp boundaries of objects. To address the first issue, we propose the Channel Information Interaction Module (CIIM), which introduces a horizontal-vertical integration mechanism in the channel dimension. This module performs feature reorganization and interaction across channels to effectively capture complementary cross-channel information. To address the second issue, we construct a collaborative decoding architecture guided by prior knowledge. This architecture generates boundary priors and object localization maps through Boundary Extraction (BE) and Region Extraction (RE) modules, then employs hybrid attention to collaboratively calibrate decoded features, effectively overcoming semantic ambiguity and imprecise boundaries. Additionally, the Multi-scale Enhancement (MSE) module enriches contextual feature representations. Extensive experiments on four COD benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of the proposed model. We further transferred our model to the Salient Object Detection (SOD) task and demonstrated its adaptability across downstream tasks, including polyp segmentation, transparent object detection, and industrial and road defect detection.

Generative recommendation (GR) integrates LLMs to enhance the understanding of long user-item sequences. Despite employing attention-based architectures, GR's workload differs markedly from that of LLM serving. GR typically processes long prompt while producing short, fixed-length outputs, yet the computational cost of each decode phase is especially high due to the large beam width. In addition, since the beam search involves a vast item space, the sorting overhead becomes particularly time-consuming. We propose xGR, a GR-oriented serving system that meets strict low-latency requirements under highconcurrency scenarios. First, xGR unifies the processing of prefill and decode phases through staged computation and separated KV cache. Second, xGR enables early sorting termination and mask-based item filtering with data structure reuse. Third, xGR reconstructs the overall pipeline to exploit multilevel overlap and multi-stream parallelism.

Given one egocentric video, we introduce the N-Body Problem: how N individuals, can hypothetically perform the same set of tasks observed in this video. The goal is to maximise speed-up, but naive assignment of video segments to individuals often violates real-world constraints, leading to physically impossible scenarios like two people using the same object or occupying the same space.

Our MLOps pipeline employs multi-criteria statistical techniques to detect distribution shifts and triggers model updates only when necessary, ensuring computational efficiency and resource optimization.

MKL seeks an optimal linear combination of base kernels that maximizes a generalized performance measure under a regularization constraint. Various norms have been used to regularize the kernel weights, including $l1$, $l2$ and $lp$, as well as the \"elastic-net\" penalty, which combines $l1$- and $l2$-norm to promote both sparsity and the selection of correlated kernels. This property makes elastic-net regularized MKL (ENMKL) especially valuable when model interpretability is critical and kernels capture correlated information, such as in neuroimaging. Previous ENMKL methods have followed a two-stage procedure: fix kernel weights, train a support vector machine (SVM) with the weighted kernel, and then update the weights via gradient descent, cutting-plane methods, or surrogate functions. Here, we introduce an alternative ENMKL formulation that yields a simple analytical update for the kernel weights. We derive explicit algorithms for both SVM and kernel ridge regression (KRR) under this framework, and implement them in the open-source Pattern Recognition for Neuroimaging Toolbox (PRoNTo). We evaluate these ENMKL algorithms against $l1$-norm MKL and against SVM (or KRR) trained on the unweighted sum of kernels across three neuroimaging applications. Our results show that ENMKL matches or outperforms $l1$-norm MKL in all tasks and only underperforms standard SVM in one scenario. Crucially, ENMKL produces sparser, more interpretable models by selectively weighting correlated kernels.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This strategy prevents information leakage from masked regions and provides richer supervision than discrete token-to-prototype assignments. To address the challenge of unbalanced semantics in an unsupervised setting, we introduce Zipfian prototypes and incorporate them using a modified Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, Zipf-Sinkhorn, which enforces a power-law prior over prototype usage and modulates the sharpness of the target softmap during training. DOS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on semantic segmentation and 3D object detection across multiple benchmarks, including nuScenes, Waymo, SemanticKITTI, ScanNet, and ScanNet200, without relying on extra data or annotations.

However, interpretability requires both sensible linguistic partitions and small rule-base sizes, which are not guaranteed by many existing fuzzy rule-mining algorithms. Evolutionary approaches can produce high-quality models but suffer from prohibitive computational costs, while neural-based methods like ANFIS have problems retaining linguistic interpretations. In this work, we propose an adaptation of classical tree-based splitting algorithms from crisp rules to fuzzy trees, combining the computational efficiency of greedy algoritms with the interpretability advantages of fuzzy logic. This approach achieves interpretable linguistic partitions and substantially improves running time compared to evolutionary-based approaches while maintaining competitive predictive performance. Our experiments on tabular classification benchmarks proof that our method achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art fuzzy classifiers with significantly lower computational cost and produces more interpretable rule bases with constrained complexity.

During iterative design, adjustments to the geometric shape inevitably require synchronized edits to the underlying parametric sequence, called geometry-driven parametric CAD editing. The task calls for 1) preserving the original sequence's structure, 2) ensuring each edit's semantic validity, and 3) maintaining high shape fidelity to the target shape, all under scarce editing data triplets. We present CADMorph, an iterative plan-generate-verify framework that orchestrates pretrained domain-specific foundation models during inference: a parameter-to-shape (P2S) latent diffusion model and a masked-parameter-prediction (MPP) model. In the planning stage, cross-attention maps from the P2S model pinpoint the segments that need modification and offer editing masks. The MPP model then infills these masks with semantically valid edits in the generation stage. During verification, the P2S model embeds each candidate sequence in shape-latent space, measures its distance to the target shape, and selects the closest one. The three stages leverage the inherent geometric consciousness and design knowledge in pretrained priors, and thus tackle structure preservation, semantic validity, and shape fidelity respectively. Besides, both P2S and MPP models are trained without triplet data, bypassing the data-scarcity bottleneck.

However, existing research communities address these challenges in isolation. Continual Learning (CL) focuses on long-term retention and mitigating catastrophic forgetting, often without strict real-time constraints. Stream Learning (SL) emphasizes rapid, efficient adaptation to high-frequency data streams, but typically neglects forgetting. Recent efforts have tried to combine these paradigms, yet no clear algorithmic overlap exists. We argue that large in-context tabular models (LTMs) provide a natural bridge for Streaming Continual Learning (SCL). In our view, unbounded streams should be summarized on-the-fly into compact sketches that can be consumed by LTMs. This recovers the classical SL motivation of compressing massive streams with fixed-size guarantees, while simultaneously aligning with the experience-replay desiderata of CL. To clarify this bridge, we show how the SL and CL communities implicitly adopt a divide-to-conquer strategy to manage the tension between plasticity (performing well on the current distribution) and stability (retaining past knowledge), while also imposing a minimal complexity constraint that motivates diversification (avoiding redundancy in what is stored) and retrieval (re-prioritizing past information when needed). Within this perspective, we propose structuring SCL with LTMs around two core principles of data selection for in-context learning: (1) distribution matching, which balances plasticity and stability, and (2) distribution compression, which controls memory size through diversification and retrieval mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While robust aggregation methods (including Krum, Bulyan, and coordinate-wise defenses) offer theoretical guarantees under idealized assumptions, their effectiveness erodes substantially when client data distributions are heterogeneous (non-IID) and adversaries can observe or approximate the defense mechanism.\n  This paper introduces SpectralKrum, a defense that fuses spectral subspace estimation with geometric neighbor-based selection. The core insight is that benign optimization trajectories, despite per-client heterogeneity, concentrate near a low-dimensional manifold that can be estimated from historical aggregates. SpectralKrum projects incoming updates into this learned subspace, applies Krum selection in compressed coordinates, and filters candidates whose orthogonal residual energy exceeds a data-driven threshold. The method requires no auxiliary data, operates entirely on model updates, and preserves FL privacy properties.\n  We evaluate SpectralKrum against eight robust baselines across seven attack scenarios on CIFAR-10 with Dirichlet-distributed non-IID partitions (alpha = 0.1).

Trained in a supervised, single-step fashion on large datasets, VGGT raises a key question: does it build upon geometric concepts like traditional multi-view methods, or does it rely primarily on learned appearance-based data-driven priors? In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of VGGT's internal mechanisms to uncover whether geometric understanding emerges within its representations. By probing intermediate features, analyzing attention patterns, and performing interventions, we examine how the model implements its functionality. Our findings reveal that VGGT implicitly performs correspondence matching within its global attention layers and encodes epipolar geometry, despite being trained without explicit geometric constraints.

We develop a unified, measure-based framework for studying single-layer softmax attention under both finite and infinite prompts. For i.i.d. Gaussian inputs, we lean on the fact that the softmax operator converges in the infinite-prompt limit to a linear operator acting on the underlying input-token measure. Building on this insight, we establish non-asymptotic concentration bounds for the output and gradient of softmax attention, quantifying how rapidly the finite-prompt model approaches its infinite-prompt counterpart, and prove that this concentration remains stable along the entire training trajectory in general in-context learning settings with sub-Gaussian tokens. In the case of in-context linear regression, we use the tractable infinite-prompt dynamics to analyze training at finite prompt length. Our results allow optimization analyses developed for linear attention to transfer directly to softmax attention when prompts are sufficiently long, showing that large-prompt softmax attention inherits the analytical structure of its linear counterpart. This, in turn, provides a principled and broadly applicable toolkit for studying the training dynamics and statistical behavior of softmax attention layers in large prompt regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6458\u8981\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4ee5\u6d4b\u5ea6\u4e3a\u57fa\u67b6\u7684\u8f6f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u5728\u957f\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u8d8b\u8fd1\u4e8e\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u5957\u7528\u5df2\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d8\u538b\u5668\u4e2dsoftmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u4f7f\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u53d1\u5c55\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u5728\u957f\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u53ca\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u6d4b\u5ea6\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u4e86softmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u6709\u9650\u548c\u65e0\u9650\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u72ec\u7acb\u540c\u5206\u5e03\u9ad8\u65af\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u65e0\u9650\u5927\u63d0\u793a\u65f6softmax\u6536\u655b\u5230\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u6709\u9650\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u5177\u6709\u975e\u6e10\u8fdb\u6d53\u5ea6\u754c\u9650\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u5904\u7406\u7684\u65e0\u7a77\u5927\u63d0\u793a\u52a8\u6001\u6765\u5206\u6790\u6709\u9650\u63d0\u793a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u8f6f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u957f\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4e0e\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u76f8\u8fd1\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5176\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u975e\u6e10\u8fdb\u96c6\u4e2d\u8fb9\u754c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u63d0\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8d8b\u8fd1\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u96c6\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ebf\u6027\u56de\u5f52\uff0c\u8be5\u53ef\u5206\u6790\u6027\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u63d0\u793a\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4f9d\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u63d0\u793a\u8db3\u591f\u957f\u65f6\uff0c\u5927\u63d0\u793a\u8f6f\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7ee7\u627f\u4e86\u5176\u7ebf\u6027\u5bf9\u5e94\u7269\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76softmax\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5728\u957f\u63d0\u793a\u72b6\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u4e0e\u7edf\u8ba1\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u5206\u6790\u5de5\u5177\u5305\u3002"}}

We present a simple geometric method for discovering interactions and redundancies: when elements are added in random sequential orders and their contributions plotted over many trials, characteristic L-shaped patterns emerge that directly reflect interaction structure. The approach quantifies how the contribution of each element depends on those added before it, revealing patterns that distinguish interaction, independence, and redundancy on a unified scale. When pairwise contributions are visualized as two--dimensional point clouds, redundant pairs form L--shaped patterns where only the first-added element contributes, while synergistic pairs form L--shaped patterns where only elements contribute together. Independent elements show order--invariant distributions. We formalize this with the L--score, a continuous measure ranging from $-1$ (perfect synergy, e.g. $Y=X_1X_2$) to $0$ (independence) to $+1$ (perfect redundancy, $X_1 \\approx X_2$).

Deep learning is particularly effective for this task, as it integrates spectral, temporal, and spatial signals that jointly reflect the canopy structure. To address this need, we introduce THREASURE-Net, a novel end-to-end framework for Tree Height Regression And Super-Resolution. The model is trained on Sentinel-2 time series using reference height metrics derived from LiDAR HD data at multiple spatial resolutions over Metropolitan France to produce annual height maps. We evaluate three model variants, producing tree-height predictions at 2.5 m, 5 m, and 10 m resolution. THREASURE-Net does not rely on any pretrained model nor on reference very high resolution optical imagery to train its super-resolution module; instead, it learns solely from LiDAR-derived height information. Our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods based on Sentinel data and is competitive with methods based on very high resolution imagery. It can be deployed to generate high-precision annual canopy-height maps, achieving mean absolute errors of 2.62 m, 2.72 m, and 2.88 m at 2.5 m, 5 m, and 10 m resolution, respectively. These results highlight the potential of THREASURE-Net for scalable and cost-effective structural monitoring of temperate forests using only freely available satellite data.

Traditional top-K selection methods, which score frames independently, often fail to optimize the selection as a whole. This independent scoring frequently results in selecting frames that are temporally clustered and visually redundant. Additionally, training lightweight selectors using pseudo labels generated offline by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) prevents the supervisory signal from dynamically adapting to task objectives. To address these limitations, we propose an end-to-end trainable, task-adaptive framework for frame selection. A Chain-of-Thought approach guides a Small Language Model (SLM) to generate task-specific implicit query vectors, which are combined with multimodal features to enable dynamic frame scoring. We further define a continuous set-level objective function that incorporates relevance, coverage, and redundancy, enabling differentiable optimization via Gumbel-Softmax to select optimal frame combinations at the set level. Finally, student-teacher mutual learning is employed, where the student selector (SLM) and teacher reasoner (MLLM) are trained to align their frame importance distributions via KL divergence. Combined with cross-entropy loss, this enables end-to-end optimization, eliminating reliance on static pseudo labels.

In this paper, we propose 3DTeethSAM, an adaptation of the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for 3D teeth segmentation. SAM2 is a pretrained foundation model for image and video segmentation, demonstrating a strong backbone in various downstream scenarios. To adapt SAM2 for 3D teeth data, we render images of 3D teeth models from predefined views, apply SAM2 for 2D segmentation, and reconstruct 3D results using 2D-3D projections. Since SAM2's performance depends on input prompts and its initial outputs often have deficiencies, and given its class-agnostic nature, we introduce three light-weight learnable modules: (1) a prompt embedding generator to derive prompt embeddings from image embeddings for accurate mask decoding, (2) a mask refiner to enhance SAM2's initial segmentation results, and (3) a mask classifier to categorize the generated masks. Additionally, we incorporate Deformable Global Attention Plugins (DGAP) into SAM2's image encoder. The DGAP enhances both the segmentation accuracy and the speed of the training process.

Traditional methods face challenges, such as noisy data, and manual parameter tuning, among others. Recently deep learning approaches have proposed alternative solutions to some of these problems. However, important challenges of existing deep learning approaches are spatially inconsistent results across neighboring seismic gathers and lack of user-control. We address these limitations by introducing ContextSeisNet, an in-context learning model, to seismic demultiple processing. Our approach conditions predictions on a support set of spatially related example pairs: neighboring common-depth point gathers from the same seismic line and their corresponding labels. This allows the model to learn task-specific processing behavior at inference time by observing how similar gathers should be processed, without any retraining. This method provides both flexibility through user-defined examples and improved lateral consistency across seismic lines. On synthetic data, ContextSeisNet outperforms a U-Net baseline quantitatively and demonstrates enhanced spatial coherence between neighboring gathers. On field data, our model achieves superior lateral consistency compared to both traditional Radon demultiple and the U-Net baseline. Relative to the U-Net, ContextSeisNet also delivers improved near-offset performance and more complete multiple removal. Notably, ContextSeisNet achieves comparable field data performance despite being trained on 90% less data, demonstrating substantial data efficiency. These results establish ContextSeisNet as a practical approach for spatially consistent seismic demultiple with potential applicability to other seismic processing tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In the context of fetal MRI, high-resolution 3D reconstruction of the brain from motion-corrupted low-resolution 2D acquisitions is a prerequisite for accurate neurodevelopmental diagnosis. While implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently established state-of-the-art performance in self-supervised slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR), they suffer from a critical computational bottleneck: accurately modeling the image acquisition physics requires expensive stochastic Monte Carlo sampling to approximate the point spread function (PSF). In this work, we propose a shift from neural network based implicit representations to Gaussian based explicit representations. By parameterizing the HR 3D image volume as a field of anisotropic Gaussian primitives, we leverage the property of Gaussians being closed under convolution and thus derive a \\textit{closed-form analytical solution} for the forward model. This formulation reduces the previously intractable acquisition integral to an exact covariance addition ($\\mathbf\u03a3_{obs} = \\mathbf\u03a3_{HR} + \\mathbf\u03a3_{PSF}$), effectively bypassing the need for compute-intensive stochastic sampling while ensuring exact gradient propagation. We demonstrate that our approach matches the reconstruction quality of self-supervised state-of-the-art SVR frameworks while delivering a 5$\\times$--10$\\times$ speed-up on neonatal and fetal data.

However, existing approaches still struggle to steer models to the user-relevant regions when only simple, generic text prompts are available. Moreover, in large-scale aerial imagery many objects exhibit highly similar visual appearances and carry rich inter-object relationships, which further complicates accurate recognition. To address these challenges, we propose Cross-modal Context-aware Learning for Visual Prompt-Guided Multimodal Image Understanding (CLV-Net). CLV-Net lets users supply a simple visual cue, a bounding box, to indicate a region of interest, and uses that cue to guide the model to generate correlated segmentation masks and captions that faithfully reflect user intent. Central to our design is a Context-Aware Mask Decoder that models and integrates inter-object relationships to strengthen target representations and improve mask quality. In addition, we introduce a Semantic and Relationship Alignment module: a Cross-modal Semantic Consistency Loss enhances fine-grained discrimination among visually similar targets, while a Relationship Consistency Loss enforces alignment between textual relations and visual interactions. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that CLV-Net outperforms existing methods and establishes new state-of-the-art results.

Traditional copy paste augmentation often produces unrealistic composites due to inaccurate foreground extraction, inconsistent scene geometry, and mismatched background semantics. To address these limitations, we propose Depth Copy Paste, a multimodal and depth aware augmentation framework that generates diverse and physically consistent face detection training samples by copying full body person instances and pasting them into semantically compatible scenes. Our approach first employs BLIP and CLIP to jointly assess semantic and visual coherence, enabling automatic retrieval of the most suitable background images for the given foreground person. To ensure high quality foreground masks that preserve facial details, we integrate SAM3 for precise segmentation and Depth-Anything to extract only the non occluded visible person regions, preventing corrupted facial textures from being used in augmentation.

Traditional change detection methods typically identify all changes between two temporal images without distinguishing the types of transitions, which can lead to results that may not align with specific user needs. Although semantic change detection methods have attempted to address this by categorizing changes into predefined classes, these methods rely on rigid class definitions and fixed model architectures, making it difficult to mix datasets with different label sets or reuse models across tasks, as the output channels are tightly coupled with the number and type of semantic classes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Referring Change Detection (RCD), which leverages natural language prompts to detect specific classes of changes in remote sensing images. By integrating language understanding with visual analysis, our approach allows users to specify the exact type of change they are interested in. However, training models for RCD is challenging due to the limited availability of annotated data and severe class imbalance in existing datasets. To address this, we propose a two-stage framework consisting of (I) \\textbf{RCDNet}, a cross-modal fusion network designed for referring change detection, and (II) \\textbf{RCDGen}, a diffusion-based synthetic data generation pipeline that produces realistic post-change images and change maps for a specified category using only pre-change image, without relying on semantic segmentation masks and thereby significantly lowering the barrier to scalable data creation. Experiments across multiple datasets show that our framework enables scalable and targeted change detection.

However, traditional domain adaptation methods often struggle to bridge the domain gap when synthetic images lack the complex textures and visual patterns of real samples. In this work, we adapt the Inversion-Based Style Transfer (InST) framework originally designed for artistic style transfer to biomedical microscopy images. Our method combines latent-space Adaptive Instance Normalization with stochastic inversion in a diffusion model to transfer the style from real fluorescence microscopy images to synthetic ones, while weakly preserving content structure.\n  We evaluate the effectiveness of our InST-based synthetic dataset for downstream cell counting by pre-training and fine-tuning EfficientNet-B0 models on various data sources, including real data, hard-coded synthetic data, and the public Cell200-s dataset. Models trained with our InST-synthesized images achieve up to 37\\% lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) compared to models trained on hard-coded synthetic data, and a 52\\% reduction in MAE compared to models trained on Cell200-s (from 53.70 to 25.95 MAE). Notably, our approach also outperforms models trained on real data alone (25.95 vs. 27.74 MAE). Further improvements are achieved when combining InST-synthesized data with lightweight domain adaptation techniques such as DACS with CutMix. These findings demonstrate that InST-based style transfer most effectively reduces the domain gap between synthetic and real microscopy data.

While leveraging segmentation data can enhance semantic stability, the lack of effective boundary supervision often leads to segmentation-like mattes lacking fine details. To this end, we introduce a learned Matting Quality Evaluator (MQE) that assesses semantic and boundary quality of alpha mattes without ground truth. It produces a pixel-wise evaluation map that identifies reliable and erroneous regions, enabling fine-grained quality assessment. The MQE scales up video matting in two ways: (1) as an online matting-quality feedback during training to suppress erroneous regions, providing comprehensive supervision, and (2) as an offline selection module for data curation, improving annotation quality by combining the strengths of leading video and image matting models.

We propose a trustworthy, frequency-aware segmentation framework built on three synergistic pillars: (1) a data-efficient training strategy combining domain-adaptive pre-training on the ISIC 2019 dataset with an ROI-constrained dual-task loss to suppress background noise; (2) an architectural refinement via a ConvNeXt V2-based encoder enhanced with a novel High-Frequency Spectral Gating (HFSG) module and stem-skip connections to capture subtle textures; and (3) a clinical trust mechanism employing K-fold ensemble and Test-Time Augmentation (TTA) to generate pixel-wise uncertainty maps. Extensive validation on an expert-annotated clinical cohort demonstrates superior performance, achieving a Dice score of 85.05% and significantly reducing boundary error (95% Hausdorff Distance improved from 44.79 px to 29.95 px), consistently outperforming strong CNN (ResNet-50 and UNet++) and Transformer (MiT-B5) baselines. Notably, our framework demonstrates high reliability with zero catastrophic failures and provides interpretable entropy maps to identify ambiguous regions for clinician review. Our approach suggests that the proposed framework establishes a robust and reliable standard for automated vitiligo assessment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

For video models, that means generating motion that preserves fidelity as well as structure. Despite progress in diffusion models, producing realistic structure-preserving motion remains challenging, especially for articulated and deformable objects such as humans and animals. Scaling training data alone, so far, has failed to resolve physically implausible transitions. Existing approaches rely on conditioning with noisy motion representations, such as optical flow or skeletons extracted using an external imperfect model. To address these challenges, we introduce an algorithm to distill structure-preserving motion priors from an autoregressive video tracking model (SAM2) into a bidirectional video diffusion model (CogVideoX). With our method, we train SAM2VideoX, which contains two innovations: (1) a bidirectional feature fusion module that extracts global structure-preserving motion priors from a recurrent model like SAM2; (2) a Local Gram Flow loss that aligns how local features move together. Experiments on VBench and in human studies show that SAM2VideoX delivers consistent gains (+2.60\\% on VBench, 21-22\\% lower FVD, and 71.4\\% human preference) over prior baselines. Specifically, on VBench, we achieve 95.51\\%, surpassing REPA (92.91\\%) by 2.60\\%, and reduce FVD to 360.57, a 21.20\\% and 22.46\\% improvement over REPA- and LoRA-finetuning, respectively.

However, a closed-loop framework that jointly understands intrinsic scene properties (e.g., albedo, normal, material, and irradiance), leverages them for video synthesis, and supports editable intrinsic representations remains unexplored. We present V-RGBX, the first end-to-end framework for intrinsic-aware video editing. V-RGBX unifies three key capabilities: (1) video inverse rendering into intrinsic channels, (2) photorealistic video synthesis from these intrinsic representations, and (3) keyframe-based video editing conditioned on intrinsic channels. At the core of V-RGBX is an interleaved conditioning mechanism that enables intuitive, physically grounded video editing through user-selected keyframes, supporting flexible manipulation of any intrinsic modality. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results show that V-RGBX produces temporally consistent, photorealistic videos while propagating keyframe edits across sequences in a physically plausible manner.

However, it relies on simplified, order-dependent alpha blending and coarse approximations of the density integral within the rasterizer, thereby limiting its ability to render complex, overlapping semi-transparent objects. In this paper, we extend rasterization-based rendering of 3D Gaussian representations with a novel method for high-fidelity transmittance computation, entirely avoiding the need for ray tracing or per-pixel sample sorting. Building on prior work in moment-based order-independent transparency, our key idea is to characterize the density distribution along each camera ray with a compact and continuous representation based on statistical moments. To this end, we analytically derive and compute a set of per-pixel moments from all contributing 3D Gaussians. From these moments, a continuous transmittance function is reconstructed for each ray, which is then independently sampled within each Gaussian. As a result, our method bridges the gap between rasterization and physical accuracy by modeling light attenuation in complex translucent media, significantly improving overall reconstruction and rendering quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e863D\u9ad8\u65af\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5149\u6805\u5316\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u7edf\u8ba1\u77e9\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u900f\u5c04\u7387\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5149\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u6216\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u534a\u900f\u660e\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\uff083DGS\uff09\u867d\u7136\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b80\u5316\u7684alpha\u6df7\u5408\u548c\u7c97\u7cd9\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u79ef\u5206\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6e32\u67d3\u590d\u6742\u91cd\u53e0\u534a\u900f\u660e\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5148\u524d\u65f6\u523b\u57fa\u5e8f\u65e0\u5173\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u6211\u4eec\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u8ba1\u77e9\u7d27\u51d1\u8fde\u7eed\u5730\u8868\u793a\u6bcf\u6761\u76f8\u673a\u5c04\u7ebf\u4e0a\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u3002\u4ece\u6240\u6709\u8d21\u732e\u76843D\u9ad8\u65af\u4e2d\u5206\u6790\u63a8\u5bfc\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bcf\u50cf\u7d20\u77e9\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u91cd\u5efa\u8fde\u7eed\u900f\u5c04\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u6bcf\u4e2a\u9ad8\u65af\u5185\u72ec\u7acb\u91c7\u6837\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u51c6\u786e\u5efa\u6a21\u590d\u6742\u534a\u900f\u660e\u4ecb\u8d28\u4e2d\u7684\u5149\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u4e86\u5149\u6805\u5316\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6574\u4f53\u91cd\u5efa\u548c\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u6805\u5316\u76843D\u9ad8\u65af\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u523b\u57fa\u900f\u5c04\u7387\u8ba1\u7b97\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u534a\u900f\u660e\u7269\u4f53\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u5149\u7ebf\u8ffd\u8e2a\u7684\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u6e32\u67d3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}
