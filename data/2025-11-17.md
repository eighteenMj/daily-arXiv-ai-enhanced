### [1] [A Mathematical Framework for AI Singularity: Conditions, Bounds, and Control of Recursive Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10668)
*Akbar Anbar Jafari,Cagri Ozcinar,Gholamreza Anbarjafari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文开发了一个分析框架来研究AI能力是否会无限增长，提出了基于资源限制和增长速率的具体测试条件，以及可实施的功率上限、吞吐量限制等安全控制措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在将AI'失控增长'（runaway growth）的推测性问题转化为可量化测试的具体条件，研究在何种可测量条件下能力会无限增长，以及如何排除这种可能性。

Method: 建立了连接能力增长与资源构建的分析框架，利用功率、带宽、内存等物理和信息理论限制定义服务边界，结合内生增长模型区分超线性和次临界机制。

Result: 开发了基于可用设施功率、IO带宽、训练吞吐量、基准性能损失和支出等可观测数据的决策规则，用于判断失控与非奇异性行为。

Conclusion: 该分析框架用可测试条件和可部署控制措施取代了纯推测，能够为认证或排除AI奇点提供具体依据，但仍受限于所选择的能力度量指标和规律性诊断。

Abstract: AI systems improve by drawing on more compute, data, energy, and better training methods. This paper asks a precise, testable version of the "runaway growth" question: under what measurable conditions could capability escalate without bound in finite time, and under what conditions can that be ruled out? We develop an analytic framework for recursive self-improvement that links capability growth to resource build-out and deployment policies. Physical and information-theoretic limits from power, bandwidth, and memory define a service envelope that caps instantaneous improvement. An endogenous growth model couples capital to compute, data, and energy and defines a critical boundary separating superlinear from subcritical regimes. We derive decision rules that map observable series (facility power, IO bandwidth, training throughput, benchmark losses, and spending) into yes/no certificates for runaway versus nonsingular behavior. The framework yields falsifiable tests based on how fast improvement accelerates relative to its current level, and it provides safety controls that are directly implementable in practice, such as power caps, throughput throttling, and evaluation gates. Analytical case studies cover capped-power, saturating-data, and investment-amplified settings, illustrating when the envelope binds and when it does not. The approach is simulation-free and grounded in measurements engineers already collect. Limitations include dependence on the chosen capability metric and on regularity diagnostics; future work will address stochastic dynamics, multi-agent competition, and abrupt architectural shifts. Overall, the results replace speculation with testable conditions and deployable controls for certifying or precluding an AI singularity.

Motivation: 为文本到图像模型提供数据归属时，现有方法计算资源消耗大，无法满足实际应用需求

Method: 将缓慢的遗忘基属性方法蒸馏到特征嵌入空间，结合高效索引和搜索，无需运行昂贵的归属算法

Result: 在MSCOCO和LAION数据集上的实验表明，该方法性能优于或与现有方法相当，速度提升2,500x - 400,000x

Conclusion: 该方法为数据归属方法在Stable Diffusion等现实模型上的大规模应用迈出了重要一步

Abstract: Data attribution for text-to-image models aims to identify the training images that most significantly influenced a generated output. Existing attribution methods involve considerable computational resources for each query, making them impractical for real-world applications. We propose a novel approach for scalable and efficient data attribution. Our key idea is to distill a slow, unlearning-based attribution method to a feature embedding space for efficient retrieval of highly influential training images. During deployment, combined with efficient indexing and search methods, our method successfully finds highly influential images without running expensive attribution algorithms. We show extensive results on both medium-scale models trained on MSCOCO and large-scale Stable Diffusion models trained on LAION, demonstrating that our method can achieve better or competitive performance in a few seconds, faster than existing methods by 2,500x - 400,000x. Our work represents a meaningful step towards the large-scale application of data attribution methods on real-world models such as Stable Diffusion.

Method: 通过德尔菲法达成手术工作流程描述共识，开发ColoWorkflow工具，并在多中心视频数据集上评估其适用性和评估者间信度。

Result: 确立了10个与手术类型无关的阶段和34个特定步骤，工具在54个结直肠手术视频中展示了广泛适用性，平均Cohen's K值为0.71（阶段）和0.66（步骤）。

Conclusion: ColoWorkflow为微创结直肠手术的视频表现评估提供了可复现的框架，能够支持跨机构基准测试和人工智能工作流程识别的发展，有望标准化培训并加速外科医生能力获得。

Abstract: Minimally invasive colorectal surgery is characterized by procedural variability, a difficult learning curve, and complications that impact quality and outcomes. Video-based assessment (VBA) offers an opportunity to generate data-driven insights to reduce variability, optimize training, and improve surgical performance. However, existing tools for workflow analysis remain difficult to standardize and implement. This study aims to develop and validate a VBA tool for workflow analysis across minimally invasive colorectal procedures. A Delphi process was conducted to achieve consensus on generalizable workflow descriptors. The resulting framework informed the development of a new VBA tool, ColoWorkflow. Independent raters then applied ColoWorkflow to a multicentre video dataset of laparoscopic and robotic colorectal surgery (CRS). Applicability and inter-rater reliability were evaluated. Consensus was achieved for 10 procedure-agnostic phases and 34 procedure-specific steps describing CRS workflows. ColoWorkflow was developed and applied to 54 colorectal operative videos (left and right hemicolectomies, sigmoid and rectosigmoid resections, and total proctocolectomies) from five centres. The tool demonstrated broad applicability, with all but one label utilized. Inter-rater reliability was moderate, with mean Cohen's K of 0.71 for phases and 0.66 for steps. Most discrepancies arose at phase transitions and step boundary definitions. ColoWorkflow is the first consensus-based, validated VBA tool for comprehensive workflow analysis in minimally invasive CRS. It establishes a reproducible framework for video-based performance assessment, enabling benchmarking across institutions and supporting the development of artificial intelligence-driven workflow recognition. Its adoption may standardize training, accelerate competency acquisition, and advance data-informed surgical quality improvement.

Method: 使用较少量数据进行基于LRP的剪枝

Result: 相比现有方法，实现了更高剪枝率且更好地保持了模型精度

Conclusion: 提出的方法在保持精度的剪枝方面优于现有基于LRP的剪枝方法

Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are widely used in image recognition and have succeeded in various domains. CNN models have become larger-scale to improve accuracy and generalization performance. Research has been conducted on compressing pre-trained models for specific target applications in environments with limited computing resources. Among model compression techniques, methods using Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), an explainable AI technique, have shown promise by achieving high pruning rates while preserving accuracy, even without fine-tuning. Because these methods do not require fine-tuning, they are suited to scenarios with limited data. However, existing LRP-based pruning approaches still suffer from significant accuracy degradation, limiting their practical usability. This study proposes a pruning method that achieves a higher pruning rate while preserving better model accuracy. Our approach to pruning with a small amount of data has achieved pruning that preserves accuracy better than existing methods.

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition plays a key role in many domains, including mental health monitoring, educational interaction, and human-computer interaction. However, existing methods often face three major challenges: unbalanced category distribution, the complexity of dynamic facial action unit time modeling, and the difficulty of feature fusion due to modal heterogeneity. With the explosive growth of multimodal data in social media scenarios, the need for building an efficient cross-modal fusion framework for emotion recognition is becoming increasingly urgent. To this end, this paper proposes Multimodal Cross-Attention Network and Contrastive Learning (MCN-CL) for multimodal emotion recognition. It uses a triple query mechanism and hard negative mining strategy to remove feature redundancy while preserving important emotional cues, effectively addressing the issues of modal heterogeneity and category imbalance. Experiment results on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets show that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, with Weighted F1 scores improving by 3.42% and 5.73%, respectively.

Abstract: This paper proposes a competitive and computationally efficient approach to probabilistic rainfall nowcasting. A video projector (V-JEPA Vision Transformer) associated to a lightweight probabilistic head is attached to a pre-trained satellite vision encoder (DINOv3\text{-}SAT493M) to map encoder tokens into a discrete empirical CDF (eCDF) over 4-hour accumulated rainfall.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PhaseWin算法通过分段窗口搜索实现近线性复杂度的区域归因，用阶段化粗到细搜索替代传统贪婪选择，在保持近贪婪近似保证的同时大幅减少模型评估次数，计算成本仅为贪婪方法的20%但能达到95%以上的归因忠实度。

Method: 提出PhaseWin算法，采用分段窗口搜索策略，结合自适应剪枝、窗口化细粒度选择和动态监督机制，以阶段化的粗到细搜索替代传统二次代价的贪婪选择。

Result: 理论上在温和单调子模假设下保持了近贪婪近似保证，实证中仅用20%计算预算就达到了贪婪归因95%以上的忠实度，在目标检测和视觉定位任务中持续优于其他归因基线。

Conclusion: PhaseWin为面向对象的跨模态模型建立了可扩展的高忠实度归因的新技术水平。

Abstract: Attribution is essential for interpreting object-level foundation models. Recent methods based on submodular subset selection have achieved high faithfulness, but their efficiency limitations hinder practical deployment in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose PhaseWin, a novel phase-window search algorithm that enables faithful region attribution with near-linear complexity. PhaseWin replaces traditional quadratic-cost greedy selection with a phased coarse-to-fine search, combining adaptive pruning, windowed fine-grained selection, and dynamic supervision mechanisms to closely approximate greedy behavior while dramatically reducing model evaluations. Theoretically, PhaseWin retains near-greedy approximation guarantees under mild monotone submodular assumptions. Empirically, PhaseWin achieves over 95% of greedy attribution faithfulness using only 20% of the computational budget, and consistently outperforms other attribution baselines across object detection and visual grounding tasks with Grounding DINO and Florence-2. PhaseWin establishes a new state of the art in scalable, high-faithfulness attribution for object-level multimodal models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了正负提示监督方法，通过利用大语言模型初始化分类提示，优化后捕捉类内和类间特征，并将语义知识传递给视觉分支来提升基于能量的OOD检测器性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于视觉-语言模型的OOD检测方法使用负提示来强调图像特征与提示内容之间的差异，但这些负提示通常包含广泛的非ID特征，可能导致捕获重叠或误导信息，从而产生次优结果。

Method: 方法首先使用大语言模型初始化类别特定的正负提示，然后进行优化——正提示关注每个类别内的特征，负提示突出类别边界周围的特征。采用基于图的架构聚合优化提示表示的语义感知监督，并将其传播到视觉分支。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1K两个基准测试集上，跨8个OOD数据集和5种不同大语言模型的广泛实验表明，该方法优于最先进的基线模型。

Conclusion: 提出的正负提示监督方法能够有效提升OOD检测性能，通过优化正负提示来捕捉更准确的语义信息，并通过图架构将其传递给视觉分支。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is committed to delineating the classification boundaries between in-distribution (ID) and OOD images. Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable OOD detection performance by integrating both visual and textual modalities. In this context, negative prompts are introduced to emphasize the dissimilarity between image features and prompt content. However, these prompts often include a broad range of non-ID features, which may result in suboptimal outcomes due to the capture of overlapping or misleading information. To address this issue, we propose Positive and Negative Prompt Supervision, which encourages negative prompts to capture inter-class features and transfers this semantic knowledge to the visual modality to enhance OOD detection performance. Our method begins with class-specific positive and negative prompts initialized by large language models (LLMs). These prompts are subsequently optimized, with positive prompts focusing on features within each class, while negative prompts highlight features around category boundaries. Additionally, a graph-based architecture is employed to aggregate semantic-aware supervision from the optimized prompt representations and propagate it to the visual branch, thereby enhancing the performance of the energy-based OOD detector. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K, across eight OOD datasets and five different LLMs, demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了YOLOv11n和YOLOv12n在面部表情识别中的性能，发现两者在控制环境和真实世界条件下都能达到良好平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在非限制性真实环境中，面部表情识别仍具挑战性，需要轻量化模型来平衡性能与效率。

Method: 将FER2013和KDEF数据集转换为目标检测格式，在统一检测分类框架下评估模型性能，使用mAP、精确率、召回率和混淆矩阵等指标。

Result: YOLOv12n在KDEF数据集上获得最高mAP 0.5为95.6，在FER2013上mAP为63.8；YOLOv11n在FER2013上精度更高为65.2。

Conclusion: 轻量级YOLO模型能在敏感性和精度之间有效平衡，适用于实时、资源受限的情感感知AI应用。

Abstract: Facial Expression Recognition remains a challenging task, especially in unconstrained, real-world environments. This study investigates the performance of two lightweight models, YOLOv11n and YOLOv12n, which are the nano variants of the latest official YOLO series, within a unified detection and classification framework for FER. Two benchmark classification datasets, FER2013 and KDEF, are converted into object detection format and model performance is evaluated using mAP 0.5, precision, recall, and confusion matrices. Results show that YOLOv12n achieves the highest overall performance on the clean KDEF dataset with a mAP 0.5 of 95.6, and also outperforms YOLOv11n on the FER2013 dataset in terms of mAP 63.8, reflecting stronger sensitivity to varied expressions. In contrast, YOLOv11n demonstrates higher precision 65.2 on FER2013, indicating fewer false positives and better reliability in noisy, real-world conditions. On FER2013, both models show more confusion between visually similar expressions, while clearer class separation is observed on the cleaner KDEF dataset. These findings underscore the trade-off between sensitivity and precision, illustrating how lightweight YOLO models can effectively balance performance and efficiency. The results demonstrate adaptability across both controlled and real-world conditions, establishing these models as strong candidates for real-time, resource-constrained emotion-aware AI applications.

Conclusion: HCD通过保留学生特定优势并利用教师知识，增强了学生的鲁棒性和泛化能力，是异构知识蒸馏的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD)transfers the dark knowledge from a complex teacher to a compact student. However, heterogeneous architecture distillation, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) to ResNet18, faces challenges due to differences in spatial feature representations.Traditional KD methods are mostly designed for homogeneous architectures and hence struggle to effectively address the disparity. Although heterogeneous KD approaches have been developed recently to solve these issues, they often incur high computational costs and complex designs, or overly rely on logit alignment, which limits their ability to leverage the complementary features. To overcome these limitations, we propose Heterogeneous Complementary Distillation (HCD),a simple yet effective framework that integrates complementary teacher and student features to align representations in shared logits.These logits are decomposed and constrained to facilitate diverse knowledge transfer to the student. Specifically, HCD processes the student's intermediate features through convolutional projector and adaptive pooling, concatenates them with teacher's feature from the penultimate layer and then maps them via the Complementary Feature Mapper (CFM) module, comprising fully connected layer,to produce shared logits.We further introduce Sub-logit Decoupled Distillation (SDD) that partitions the shared logits into n sub-logits, which are fused with teacher's logits to rectify classification.To ensure sub-logit diversity and reduce redundant knowledge transfer, we propose an Orthogonality Loss (OL).By preserving student-specific strengths and leveraging teacher knowledge,HCD enhances robustness and generalization in students.Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100, Fine-grained (e.g., CUB200)and ImageNet-1K datasets demonstrate that HCD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods,establishing it as an effective solution for heterogeneous KD.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出FedBCS方法来解决联邦学习中医学图像分割的特征异质性问题，通过频率域自适应风格校准和上下文感知双级原型对齐来获取领域不变的原型，提高模型鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习方法在处理医学图像分割时存在两个主要问题：不完整的上下文表示学习（只关注最终层特征）和层间风格偏置累积（忽视中间层的领域特定偏置），导致模型鲁棒性下降。

Method: 1. 频率域自适应风格校准：在原型构建中解耦内容-风格表示并学习最优风格参数；2. 上下文感知双级原型对齐：从编码器和解码器的不同层提取领域不变原型，并结合上下文信息进行细粒度表示对齐。

Result: 在两个公共数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法的性能表现优异。

Conclusion: FedBCS方法通过领域不变上下文原型对齐有效解决了联邦学习中的特征异质性问题，显著提高了医学图像分割的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated learning enables multiple medical institutions to train a global model without sharing data, yet feature heterogeneity from diverse scanners or protocols remains a major challenge. Many existing works attempt to address this issue by leveraging model representations (e.g., mean feature vectors) to correct local training; however, they often face two key limitations: 1) Incomplete Contextual Representation Learning: Current approaches primarily focus on final-layer features, overlooking critical multi-level cues and thus diluting essential context for accurate segmentation. 2) Layerwise Style Bias Accumulation: Although utilizing representations can partially align global features, these methods neglect domain-specific biases within intermediate layers, allowing style discrepancies to build up and reduce model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose FedBCS to bridge feature representation gaps via domain-invariant contextual prototypes alignment. Specifically, we introduce a frequency-domain adaptive style recalibration into prototype construction that not only decouples content-style representations but also learns optimal style parameters, enabling more robust domain-invariant prototypes. Furthermore, we design a context-aware dual-level prototype alignment method that extracts domain-invariant prototypes from different layers of both encoder and decoder and fuses them with contextual information for finer-grained representation alignment. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our method exhibits remarkable performance.

Conclusion: DEFT-LLM通过运动语义对齐和多专家解耦，有效注入物理先验并利用大语言模型跨模态推理能力，实现精确捕捉微妙情感线索。

Abstract: Micro expression recognition (MER) is crucial for inferring genuine emotion. Applying a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to this task enables spatio-temporal analysis of facial motion and provides interpretable descriptions. However, there are still two core challenges: (1) The entanglement of static appearance and dynamic motion cues prevents the model from focusing on subtle motion; (2) Textual labels in existing MER datasets do not fully correspond to underlying facial muscle movements, creating a semantic gap between text supervision and physical motion. To address these issues, we propose DEFT-LLM, which achieves motion semantic alignment by multi-expert disentanglement. We first introduce Uni-MER, a motion-driven instruction dataset designed to align text with local facial motion. Its construction leverages dual constraints from optical flow and Action Unit (AU) labels to ensure spatio-temporal consistency and reasonable correspondence to the movements. We then design an architecture with three experts to decouple facial dynamics into independent and interpretable representations (structure, dynamic textures, and motion-semantics). By integrating the instruction-aligned knowledge from Uni-MER into DEFT-LLM, our method injects effective physical priors for micro expressions while also leveraging the cross modal reasoning ability of large language models, thus enabling precise capture of subtle emotional cues. Experiments on multiple challenging MER benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, as well as a particular advantage in interpretable modeling of local facial motion.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ERMoE is a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) transformer that reparameterizes experts in orthonormal eigenbasis and uses Eigenbasis Score for content-aware routing, achieving SOTA performance while eliminating explicit balancing losses.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address challenges in MoE architectures: misalignment between router logits and expert internal structure causing unstable routing/expert underutilization, and load imbalances creating straggler bottlenecks. Standard load-balancing solutions weaken expert specialization and hurt performance.

Method: Reparameterizes each expert in learned orthonormal eigenbasis and replaces learned gating logits with Eigenbasis Score (cosine similarity between input features and expert's basis), enabling content-aware routing without explicit balancing losses.

Result: Achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet classification and cross-modal image-text retrieval benchmarks (COCO, Flickr30K), produces flatter expert load distributions, and MRI variant (ERMoE-ba) improves brain age prediction accuracy by >7% with anatomically interpretable specializations.

Conclusion: ERMoE introduces a new architectural principle for sparse expert models that directly addresses routing instabilities and enables improved performance with scalable, interpretable specialization.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures expand model capacity by sparsely activating experts but face two core challenges: misalignment between router logits and each expert's internal structure leads to unstable routing and expert underutilization, and load imbalances create straggler bottlenecks. Standard solutions, such as auxiliary load-balancing losses, can reduce load disparities but often weaken expert specialization and hurt downstream performance. To address these issues, we propose ERMoE, a sparse MoE transformer that reparameterizes each expert in a learned orthonormal eigenbasis and replaces learned gating logits with an "Eigenbasis Score", defined as the cosine similarity between input features and an expert's basis. This content-aware routing ties token assignments directly to experts' representation spaces, stabilizing utilization and promoting interpretable specialization without sacrificing sparsity. Crucially, ERMoE removes the need for explicit balancing losses and avoids the interfering gradients they introduce. We show that ERMoE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ImageNet classification and cross-modal image-text retrieval benchmarks (e.g., COCO, Flickr30K), while naturally producing flatter expert load distributions. Moreover, a 3D MRI variant (ERMoE-ba) improves brain age prediction accuracy by more than 7\% and yields anatomically interpretable expert specializations. ERMoE thus introduces a new architectural principle for sparse expert models that directly addresses routing instabilities and enables improved performance with scalable, interpretable specialization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DMC是一个用于CLIP-based类增量学习的两阶段框架，将视觉编码器和文本软提示的优化解耦；DMC-OT是其增强版，通过最优传输校准策略和任务特定提示提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP的类增量学习方法存在分类器偏差问题，任务特定软提示容易过拟合新类别。同时，视觉编码器更新会导致类间高斯统计量的分布漂移。

Method: DMC采用两阶段训练：固定文本优化视觉编码器，固定视觉优化文本软提示。DMC-OT引入最优传输校准策略对齐内存统计量，并设计任务特定提示增强任务间分离性。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、Imagenet-R、CUB-200、UCF-101等数据集上，DMC和DMC-OT达到最先进性能，DMC-OT相较于DMC平均提升1.80%准确率。

Conclusion: 提出的DMC框架有效解决了CLIP类增量学习中的模型偏差和分布漂移问题，DMC-OT通过最优传输校准进一步提升了性能。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) enables models to continuously learn new categories from sequential tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. While recent advances in vision-language models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong generalization across domains, extending them to continual settings remains challenging. In particular, learning task-specific soft prompts for newly introduced classes often leads to severe classifier bias, as the text prototypes overfit to recent categories when prior data are unavailable. In this paper, we propose DMC, a simple yet effective two-stage framework for CLIP-based CIL that decouples the adaptation of the vision encoder and the optimization of textual soft prompts. Each stage is trained with the other frozen, allowing one modality to act as a stable semantic anchor for the other to preserve cross-modal alignment. Furthermore, current CLIP-based CIL approaches typically store class-wise Gaussian statistics for generative replay, yet they overlook the distributional drift that arises when the vision encoder is updated over time. To address this issue, we introduce DMC-OT, an enhanced version of DMC that incorporates an optimal-transport guided calibration strategy to align memory statistics across evolving encoders, along with a task-specific prompting design that enhances inter-task separability. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-100, Imagenet-R, CUB-200, and UCF-101 demonstrate that both DMC and DMC-OT achieve state-of-the-art performance, with DMC-OT further improving accuracy by an average of 1.80%.

*Bowen Sun,Yujun Cai,Ming-Hsuan Yang,Hang Wu,Yiwei Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文分析了视频LLM中的时间不稳定性问题，提出Phase Aggregated Smoothing(PAS)方法通过应用相反相位偏移并聚合输出来平滑时间核，有效增强了视频LLM的时间鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频LLM存在时间不一致性问题：微小的帧时间偏移会导致注意力翻转和相关帧被抑制。研究发现这种不稳定性源于多模态RoPE扩展产生的逆傅里叶时间核在帧尺度上产生波纹，扰乱了原本应由原始查询键内积决定的注意力。

Method: 提出Phase Aggregated Smoothing(PAS)，这是一种无需训练的方法：在多个头之间应用小的相反相位偏移，然后聚合它们的输出。该方法保持每个头的频谱幅度，同时通过聚合有效平滑时间核并降低相位敏感性。

Result: 在多个视频理解基准测试中（使用匹配的token预算），实验显示出一致性的改进，且计算开销可忽略不计。分析表明RoPE旋转对数可近似为内容点积按时间核缩放，平滑该核可获得对微小时间偏移的Lipschitz稳定性。

Conclusion: PAS为视频LLM提供了即插即用的升级方案，能够实现鲁棒的时间编码，通过多相位平均抑制高频波纹同时保持Nyquist有效采样下的每个头频谱。

Abstract: Video LLMs suffer from temporal inconsistency: small shifts in frame timing can flip attention and suppress relevant frames. We trace this instability to the common extension of Rotary Position Embeddings to video through multimodal RoPE. The induced inverse Fourier time kernel exhibits frame-scale ripples that multiply adjacent frames by different factors, which perturbs attention that should otherwise be governed by the raw query key inner product. We present Phase Aggregated Smoothing (PAS), a simple, training-free mechanism that applies small opposed phase offsets across heads and then aggregates their outputs. PAS preserves the per-head spectrum magnitude, while the aggregation effectively smooths the temporal kernel and reduces phase sensitivity without changing the positional encoding structure. Our analysis shows that the RoPE rotated logit can be approximated as a content dot product scaled by a time kernel; smoothing this kernel yields Lipschitz stability of attention to small temporal shifts; multi phase averaging attenuates high frequency ripples while preserving per-head spectra under Nyquist-valid sampling. Experiments on multiple video understanding benchmarks under matched token budgets show consistent improvements with negligible computational overhead. PAS provides a plug and play upgrade for robust temporal encoding in Video LLMs.

*Jeffrey Liu,Rongbin Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需训练的二值验证工作流，用于提升现成视觉语言模型的零样本视觉任务性能。该流程包括量化和二值化两个步骤，将开放性问题转化为多项选择题并进一步简化为True/False验证问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对现成视觉语言模型在零样本视觉任务中的性能优化，旨在通过推理时设计而非任务特定训练来提升准确性，提供实用的性能提升路径。

Method: 采用两步流程：(1)量化：将开放性问题转化为明确候选列表的多项选择题；(2)二值化：对每个候选提出True/False问题，通过确定性逻辑解决——如果恰好一个为True则选择它，否则回归到剩余可信候选的多项选择。

Result: 在参考表达式接地点、空间推理和BLINK-Jigsaw任务上的评估显示，相对于直接回答开放性问题，量化到多项选择显著提升性能，True/False二值化提供一致的额外提升，相同工作流在所有任务上都产生显著改进。

Conclusion: 该工作流通过正式理论确立了将开放性问题量化为多项选择并进一步二值化为True/False验证的难度阶梯，并通过简单分析解释了布尔解决为何提升准确性，为当前视觉语言模型提供了简单统一的零样本视觉增强方案。

Abstract: We propose a training-free, binary verification workflow for zero-shot vision with off-the-shelf VLMs. It comprises two steps: (i) quantization, which turns the open-ended query into a multiple-choice question (MCQ) with a small, explicit list of unambiguous candidates; and (ii) binarization, which asks one True/False question per candidate and resolves deterministically: if exactly one is True, select it; otherwise, revert to an MCQ over the remaining plausible candidates. We evaluate the workflow on referring expression grounding (REC), spatial reasoning (Spatial-Map, Spatial-Grid, Spatial-Maze), and BLINK-Jigsaw. Relative to answering open-ended queries directly, quantization to MCQ yields large gains, and True/False binarization provides a consistent additional boost. Across all tasks, the same workflow produces significant improvements, indicating generality. Our theory formalizes how open-ended vision queries can be quantized to MCQs and further binarized into True/False verifications, establishing a hardness ladder. A simple analysis explains why Boolean resolution boosts accuracy. Together, these components yield a simple and unified workflow that emphasizes inference-time design over task-specific training. It offers a practical, drop-in path to stronger zero-shot vision with today's VLMs.

*Keunwoo Park,Jihye Chae,Joong Ho Ahn,Jihoon Kweon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为CLUE的新型文本到图像生成方法，该方法使用固定的提示格式，在不依赖附加数据的情况下实现多样化和稳定的图像生成，尤其在专业领域（如医学图像）中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成方法在通用领域表现良好，但在专业领域（如医学）面临数据种类有限和数据量不足的问题。因此，需要开发一种不需要额外数据即可保持生成多样性和稳定性的方法。

Method: 基于Stable Diffusion架构，引入了一个风格编码器（Style Encoder）来处理图像和提示，生成风格嵌入。这些嵌入随后被输入到U-Net架构的新增第二注意力层中。通过使用Kullback-Leibler散度，潜在空间在独立于提示的高斯区域内实现了图像特征的连续表示。

Result: 在耳炎数据集上，CLUE将FID从46.81降至9.30，召回率从49.60%提升至70.29%。仅使用合成数据训练的模型在1000%数据规模下F1分数达到83.21%（对比73.83%）。合成数据与等量真实数据结合时，F1分数达到94.76%，优于仅使用真实数据的情况。

Conclusion: CLUE能够从有限数据集中实现多样且稳定的图像生成，并作为特定领域应用中有效的增强数据方法。

Abstract: Text-to-image synthesis models require the ability to generate diverse images while maintaining stability. To overcome this challenge, a number of methods have been proposed, including the collection of prompt-image datasets and the integration of additional data modalities during training. Although these methods have shown promising results in general domains, they face limitations when applied to specialized fields such as medicine, where only limited types and insufficient amounts of data are available. We present CLUE (Controllable Latent space of Unprompted Embeddings), a generative model framework that achieves diverse generation while maintaining stability through fixed-format prompts without requiring any additional data. Based on the Stable Diffusion architecture, CLUE employs a Style Encoder that processes images and prompts to generate style embeddings, which are subsequently fed into a new second attention layer of the U-Net architecture. Through Kullback-Leibler divergence, the latent space achieves continuous representation of image features within Gaussian regions, independent of prompts. Performance was assessed on otitis media dataset. CLUE reduced FID to 9.30 (vs. 46.81) and improved recall to 70.29% (vs. 49.60%). A classifier trained on synthetic-only data at 1000% scale achieved an F1 score of 83.21% (vs. 73.83%). Combining synthetic data with equal amounts of real data achieved an F1 score of 94.76%, higher than when using only real data. On an external dataset, synthetic-only training achieved an F1 score of 76.77% (vs. 60.61%) at 1000% scale. The combined approach achieved an F1 score of 85.78%, higher than when using only the internal dataset. These results demonstrate that CLUE enables diverse yet stable image generation from limited datasets and serves as an effective data augmentation method for domain-specific applications.

TL;DR: PROMISE是一种新型多模态框架，通过提示学习的层次对比学习方法，在模态缺失情况下提供稳健的跨模态表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态模型在面对真实世界中模态缺失情况时性能显著下降，主要源于完整与不完整模态场景间的表示学习不一致。

Method: 将多模态提示学习融入层次对比学习框架，配备专门的提示注意力机制，动态生成模态缺失场景下的稳健一致表示。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验和消融研究显示PROMISE优于当前最优多模态方法。

Conclusion: PROMISE能有效弥合完整与不完整数据间的表示差距，提升模态缺失条件下的模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multimodal models integrating natural language and visual information have substantially improved generalization of representation models. However, their effectiveness significantly declines in real-world situations where certain modalities are missing or unavailable. This degradation primarily stems from inconsistent representation learning between complete multimodal data and incomplete modality scenarios. Existing approaches typically address missing modalities through relatively simplistic generation methods, yet these approaches fail to adequately preserve cross-modal consistency, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal framework named PROMISE, a PROMpting-Attentive HIerarchical ContraStive LEarning approach designed explicitly for robust cross-modal representation under conditions of missing modalities. Specifically, PROMISE innovatively incorporates multimodal prompt learning into a hierarchical contrastive learning framework, equipped with a specially designed prompt-attention mechanism. This mechanism dynamically generates robust and consistent representations for scenarios where particular modalities are absent, thereby effectively bridging the representational gap between complete and incomplete data. Extensive experiments conducted on benchmark datasets, along with comprehensive ablation studies, clearly demonstrate the superior performance of PROMISE compared to current state-of-the-art multimodal methods.

Motivation: 现有视频生成系统过于关注低层次视觉指标而忽视情感维度，缺乏专门资源来连接情感理解与生成任务，导致视频内容的情感表达受限。

Method: 构建包含卡通动画、电影片段和动画表情的情感标注数据集EmoVid，分析视觉特征与情感感知的时空模式，并通过微调Wan2.1模型开发情感条件视频生成技术。

Result: 在文本到视频和图像到视频任务中，生成视频的定量指标和视觉质量均获得显著提升。

Conclusion: EmoVid为情感视频计算建立了新基准，不仅为艺术风格化视频的视觉情感分析提供见解，还为提升视频生成的情感表达提供了实用方法。

Abstract: Emotion plays a pivotal role in video-based expression, but existing video generation systems predominantly focus on low-level visual metrics while neglecting affective dimensions. Although emotion analysis has made progress in the visual domain, the video community lacks dedicated resources to bridge emotion understanding with generative tasks, particularly for stylized and non-realistic contexts. To address this gap, we introduce EmoVid, the first multimodal, emotion-annotated video dataset specifically designed for creative media, which includes cartoon animations, movie clips, and animated stickers. Each video is annotated with emotion labels, visual attributes (brightness, colorfulness, hue), and text captions. Through systematic analysis, we uncover spatial and temporal patterns linking visual features to emotional perceptions across diverse video forms. Building on these insights, we develop an emotion-conditioned video generation technique by fine-tuning the Wan2.1 model. The results show a significant improvement in both quantitative metrics and the visual quality of generated videos for text-to-video and image-to-video tasks. EmoVid establishes a new benchmark for affective video computing. Our work not only offers valuable insights into visual emotion analysis in artistically styled videos, but also provides practical methods for enhancing emotional expression in video generation.

Result: 在各种视觉理解、推理和生成基准上，VisMem相比原模型平均性能提升11.8%，优于所有对比方法

Conclusion: VisMem为潜在外层记忆增强建立了新范式，能够保持感知保真度和语义一致性

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), their performance on a range of complex visual tasks is often hindered by a "visual processing bottleneck": a propensity to lose grounding in visual evidence and exhibit a deficit in contextualized visual experience during prolonged generation. Drawing inspiration from human cognitive memory theory, which distinguishes short-term visually-dominant memory and long-term semantically-dominant memory, we propose VisMem, a cognitively-aligned framework that equips VLMs with dynamic latent vision memories, a short-term module for fine-grained perceptual retention and a long-term module for abstract semantic consolidation. These memories are seamlessly invoked during inference, allowing VLMs to maintain both perceptual fidelity and semantic consistency across thinking and generation. Extensive experiments across diverse visual benchmarks for understanding, reasoning, and generation reveal that VisMem delivers a significant average performance boost of 11.8% relative to the vanilla model and outperforms all counterparts, establishing a new paradigm for latent-space memory enhancement. The code will be available: https://github.com/YU-deep/VisMem.git.

Motivation: 现有推理时引导方法缺乏自适应性和选择性，无法根据提示词调整引导强度以及仅针对图像不安全区域。扩散式T2I模型虽能生成高质量图像，但也容易创建有害内容，引发社会关注，需要更安全的生成方法。

Method: SP-Guard通过估计提示词危害程度，应用选择性引导掩码，只对不安全区域进行引导，解决了现有方法的适应性和选择性不足问题。

Result: 实验表明SP-Guard比现有方法生成的图像更安全，同时最小化了意外内容改变。

Conclusion: 除了提高安全性外，研究还强调了图像生成中透明性和可控性的重要性，SP-Guard为安全图像生成提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While diffusion-based T2I models have achieved remarkable image generation quality, they also enable easy creation of harmful content, raising social concerns and highlighting the need for safer generation. Existing inference-time guiding methods lack both adaptivity--adjusting guidance strength based on the prompt--and selectivity--targeting only unsafe regions of the image. Our method, SP-Guard, addresses these limitations by estimating prompt harmfulness and applying a selective guidance mask to guide only unsafe areas. Experiments show that SP-Guard generates safer images than existing methods while minimizing unintended content alteration. Beyond improving safety, our findings highlight the importance of transparency and controllability in image generation.

Motivation: 现有的U-Net变体在逆问题中仍存在信息丢失问题，限制了高频细节的恢复，需要一种方法来防止信息退化同时选择性抑制冗余特征

Method: 提出选择性抑制完美重构方法，利用小波完美重构特性，自由于严格框架约束，作为即插即用解码器块集成到各种U-Net变体中

Conclusion: SUPER解码器块展示了即插即用的通用性，能够实现高频保真度和全局一致性，在统一的再现感知框架内增强表征多样性

Abstract: Skip-connected encoder-decoder architectures (U-Net variants) are widely adopted for inverse problems but still suffer from information loss, limiting recovery of fine high-frequency details. We present Selectively Suppressed Perfect Reconstruction (SUPER), which exploits the perfect reconstruction (PR) property of wavelets to prevent information degradation while selectively suppressing (SS) redundant features. Free from rigid framelet constraints, SUPER serves as a plug-and-play decoder block for diverse U-Net variants, eliminating their intrinsic reconstruction bottlenecks and enhancing representational richness. Experiments across diverse crack benchmarks, including state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, demonstrate the structural potential of the proposed SUPER Decoder Block. Maintaining comparable computational cost, SUPER enriches representational diversity through increased parameterization. In small-scale in-domain experiments on the CrackVision12K dataset, SUPER markedly improves thin-crack segmentation performance, particularly for cracks narrower than 4 px, underscoring its advantage in high-frequency dominant settings. In smartphone image denoising on SIDD, where low-frequency components prevail, SUPER still achieves a moderate gain in PSNR, confirming its robustness across low- and high-frequency regimes. These results validate its plug-and-play generality across U-Net variants, achieving high-frequency fidelity and global coherence within a unified, reconstruction-aware framework.

Conclusion: AirCopBench填补了多智能体协作感知评估基准的空白，揭示了多模态大语言模型在复杂协作场景中的局限性，为改进模型性能提供了重要参考，并证明了模拟数据在实际应用中的可行性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in single-agent vision tasks, yet benchmarks for evaluating multi-agent collaborative perception remain scarce. This gap is critical, as multi-drone systems provide enhanced coverage, robustness, and collaboration compared to single-sensor setups. Existing multi-image benchmarks mainly target basic perception tasks using high-quality single-agent images, thus failing to evaluate MLLMs in more complex, egocentric collaborative scenarios, especially under real-world degraded perception conditions.To address these challenges, we introduce AirCopBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs in embodied aerial collaborative perception under challenging perceptual conditions. AirCopBench includes 14.6k+ questions derived from both simulator and real-world data, spanning four key task dimensions: Scene Understanding, Object Understanding, Perception Assessment, and Collaborative Decision, across 14 task types. We construct the benchmark using data from challenging degraded-perception scenarios with annotated collaborative events, generating large-scale questions through model-, rule-, and human-based methods under rigorous quality control. Evaluations on 40 MLLMs show significant performance gaps in collaborative perception tasks, with the best model trailing humans by 24.38% on average and exhibiting inconsistent results across tasks. Fine-tuning experiments further confirm the feasibility of sim-to-real transfer in aerial collaborative perception and reasoning.

Conclusion: 所提出的EmbryoDiff框架能有效解决细胞遮挡带来的特征模糊问题，显著提高胚胎发育阶段识别准确度。

Abstract: Identification of fine-grained embryo developmental stages during In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) is crucial for assessing embryo viability. Although recent deep learning methods have achieved promising accuracy, existing discriminative models fail to utilize the distributional prior of embryonic development to improve accuracy. Moreover, their reliance on single-focal information leads to incomplete embryonic representations, making them susceptible to feature ambiguity under cell occlusions. To address these limitations, we propose EmbryoDiff, a two-stage diffusion-based framework that formulates the task as a conditional sequence denoising process. Specifically, we first train and freeze a frame-level encoder to extract robust multi-focal features. In the second stage, we introduce a Multi-Focal Feature Fusion Strategy that aggregates information across focal planes to construct a 3D-aware morphological representation, effectively alleviating ambiguities arising from cell occlusions. Building on this fused representation, we derive complementary semantic and boundary cues and design a Hybrid Semantic-Boundary Condition Block to inject them into the diffusion-based denoising process, enabling accurate embryonic stage classification. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results. Notably, with only a single denoising step, our model obtains the best average test performance, reaching 82.8% and 81.3% accuracy on the two datasets, respectively.

Conclusion: 混合粒度缓存方法能有效平衡生成效率与视觉质量，显著提升可控生成模型的实用性。

Abstract: Controllable generative models have been widely used to improve the realism of synthetic visual content. However, such models must handle control conditions and content generation computational requirements, resulting in generally low generation efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a Hybrid-Grained Cache (HGC) approach that reduces computational overhead by adopting cache strategies with different granularities at different computational stages. Specifically, (1) we use a coarse-grained cache (block-level) based on feature reuse to dynamically bypass redundant computations in encoder-decoder blocks between each step of model reasoning. (2) We design a fine-grained cache (prompt-level) that acts within a module, where the fine-grained cache reuses cross-attention maps within consecutive reasoning steps and extends them to the corresponding module computations of adjacent steps. These caches of different granularities can be seamlessly integrated into each computational link of the controllable generation process. We verify the effectiveness of HGC on four benchmark datasets, especially its advantages in balancing generation efficiency and visual quality. For example, on the COCO-Stuff segmentation benchmark, our HGC significantly reduces the computational cost (MACs) by 63% (from 18.22T to 6.70T), while keeping the loss of semantic fidelity (quantized performance degradation) within 1.5%.

Method: 构建CrossMed基准，采用Modality-Anatomy-Task（MAT）框架，将四个公共医学数据集统一转换为视觉问答格式，创建20,200个多项选择题实例。评估两种开源多模态LLM在不同数据分割条件下的表现。

Result: 在相关MAT分割条件下，模型达到83.2%的分类准确率和0.75的分割cIoU，但在不相关和零重叠条件下性能显著下降。跨任务转移实验显示仅使用分类数据训练时分割性能提升了7% cIoU。

Conclusion: CrossMed为医学视觉语言模型提供了严格的评估平台，证明了多模态LLM在组合泛化方面的独特优势，揭示现有方法在零样本、跨任务和模态无关泛化方面的局限性和挑战。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models have enabled unified processing of visual and textual inputs, offering promising applications in general-purpose medical AI. However, their ability to generalize compositionally across unseen combinations of imaging modality, anatomy, and task type remains underexplored. We introduce CrossMed, a benchmark designed to evaluate compositional generalization (CG) in medical multimodal LLMs using a structured Modality-Anatomy-Task (MAT) schema. CrossMed reformulates four public datasets, CheXpert (X-ray classification), SIIM-ACR (X-ray segmentation), BraTS 2020 (MRI classification and segmentation), and MosMedData (CT classification) into a unified visual question answering (VQA) format, resulting in 20,200 multiple-choice QA instances. We evaluate two open-source multimodal LLMs, LLaVA-Vicuna-7B and Qwen2-VL-7B, on both Related and Unrelated MAT splits, as well as a zero-overlap setting where test triplets share no Modality, Anatomy, or Task with the training data. Models trained on Related splits achieve 83.2 percent classification accuracy and 0.75 segmentation cIoU, while performance drops significantly under Unrelated and zero-overlap conditions, demonstrating the benchmark difficulty. We also show cross-task transfer, where segmentation performance improves by 7 percent cIoU even when trained using classification-only data. Traditional models (ResNet-50 and U-Net) show modest gains, confirming the broad utility of the MAT framework, while multimodal LLMs uniquely excel at compositional generalization. CrossMed provides a rigorous testbed for evaluating zero-shot, cross-task, and modality-agnostic generalization in medical vision-language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着物联网设备快速发展，在资源极度受限的嵌入式设备上集成AI面临计算和通信挑战，传统方法在动态信道条件下效率低下，需要更有效的错误容忍协作方案。

Conclusion: SemanticNN能够在严格的资源约束下实现压缩且鲁棒的协作推理卸载，通过语义级错误容忍在动态信道条件下显著提升传输效率。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of the Internet of Things (IoT), integrating artificial intelligence (AI) on extremely weak embedded devices has garnered significant attention, enabling improved real-time performance and enhanced data privacy. However, the resource limitations of such devices and unreliable network conditions necessitate error-resilient device-edge collaboration systems. Traditional approaches focus on bit-level transmission correctness, which can be inefficient under dynamic channel conditions. In contrast, we propose SemanticNN, a semantic codec that tolerates bit-level errors in pursuit of semantic-level correctness, enabling compressive and resilient collaborative inference offloading under strict computational and communication constraints. It incorporates a Bit Error Rate (BER)-aware decoder that adapts to dynamic channel conditions and a Soft Quantization (SQ)-based encoder to learn compact representations. Building on this architecture, we introduce Feature-augmentation Learning, a novel training strategy that enhances offloading efficiency. To address encoder-decoder capability mismatches from asymmetric resources, we propose XAI-based Asymmetry Compensation to enhance decoding semantic fidelity. We conduct extensive experiments on STM32 using three models and six datasets across image classification and object detection tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that, under varying transmission error rates, SemanticNN significantly reduces feature transmission volume by 56.82-344.83x while maintaining superior inference accuracy.

Motivation: 传统4D流MRI需要长时间扫描才能获得高时空分辨率，而现有PINN方法训练缓慢且需要针对每个患者单独训练，限制了临床应用。

Method: 提出了PINGS-X框架，采用轴向对齐时空高斯表示，包括归一化高斯喷洒、轴向对齐高斯函数和高斯合并过程三个创新方法。

Conclusion: PINGS-X有效解决了4D流MRI超分辨率重建中的效率瓶颈，为临床实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: 4D flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a reliable, non-invasive approach for estimating blood flow velocities, vital for cardiovascular diagnostics. Unlike conventional MRI focused on anatomical structures, 4D flow MRI requires high spatiotemporal resolution for early detection of critical conditions such as stenosis or aneurysms. However, achieving such resolution typically results in prolonged scan times, creating a trade-off between acquisition speed and prediction accuracy. Recent studies have leveraged physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for super-resolution of MRI data, but their practical applicability is limited as the prohibitively slow training process must be performed for each patient. To overcome this limitation, we propose PINGS-X, a novel framework modeling high-resolution flow velocities using axes-aligned spatiotemporal Gaussian representations. Inspired by the effectiveness of 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) in novel view synthesis, PINGS-X extends this concept through several non-trivial novel innovations: (i) normalized Gaussian splatting with a formal convergence guarantee, (ii) axes-aligned Gaussians that simplify training for high-dimensional data while preserving accuracy and the convergence guarantee, and (iii) a Gaussian merging procedure to prevent degenerate solutions and boost computational efficiency. Experimental results on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and real 4D flow MRI datasets demonstrate that PINGS-X substantially reduces training time while achieving superior super-resolution accuracy. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/SpatialAILab/PINGS-X.

Motivation: 现有的基于权重的LoRA融合方法存在相互干扰问题，导致主控LoRA主导其他LoRA，造成保真度下降和视觉质量恶化。

Method: 通过SVD提取主要风格方向，将主体LoRA投影到其正交零空间中，并引入软投影机制控制主体保真度与风格一致性的权衡。

Conclusion: NP-LoRA提供了一种有效的LoRA融合框架，通过结构分离解决了现有方法中的干扰问题，在广泛场景中实现高质量的可控生成。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) fusion has emerged as a key technique for reusing and composing learned subject and style representations for controllable generation without costly retraining. However, existing methods rely on weight-based merging, where one LoRA often dominates the other, leading to interference and degraded fidelity. This interference is structural: separately trained LoRAs occupy low-rank high-dimensional subspaces, leading to non-orthogonal and overlapping representations. In this work, we analyze the internal structure of LoRAs and find their generative behavior is dominated by a few principal directions in the low-rank subspace, which should remain free from interference during fusion. To achieve this, we propose Null Space Projection LoRA (NP-LoRA), a projection-based framework for LoRA fusion that enforces subspace separation to prevent structural interference among principal directions. Specifically, we first extract principal style directions via singular value decomposition (SVD) and then project the subject LoRA into its orthogonal null space. Furthermore, we introduce a soft projection mechanism that enables smooth control over the trade-off between subject fidelity and style consistency. Experiments show NP-LoRA consistently improves fusion quality over strong baselines (e.g., DINO and CLIP-based metrics, with human and LLM preference scores), and applies broadly across backbones and LoRA pairs without retraining.

Abstract: Image composition aims to seamlessly insert foreground object into background. Despite the huge progress in generative image composition, the existing methods are still struggling with simultaneous detail preservation and foreground pose/view adjustment. To address this issue, we extend the existing generative composition model to multi-reference version, which allows using arbitrary number of foreground reference images. Furthermore, we propose to calibrate the global and local features of foreground reference images to make them compatible with the background information. The calibrated reference features can supplement the original reference features with useful global and local information of proper pose/view. Extensive experiments on MVImgNet and MureCom demonstrate that the generative model can greatly benefit from the calibrated reference features.

Conclusion: LiteAttention通过利用扩散注意力的时间相干性，在保持生成质量的同时显著降低了计算复杂度，解决了现有加速方法的基本权衡问题。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers, particularly for video generation, achieve remarkable quality but suffer from quadratic attention complexity, leading to prohibitive latency. Existing acceleration methods face a fundamental trade-off: dynamically estimating sparse attention patterns at each denoising step incurs high computational overhead and estimation errors, while static sparsity patterns remain fixed and often suboptimal throughout denoising. We identify a key structural property of diffusion attention, namely, its sparsity patterns exhibit strong temporal coherence across denoising steps. Tiles deemed non-essential at step $t$ typically remain so at step $t+δ$. Leveraging this observation, we introduce LiteAttention, a method that exploits temporal coherence to enable evolutionary computation skips across the denoising sequence. By marking non-essential tiles early and propagating skip decisions forward, LiteAttention eliminates redundant attention computations without repeated profiling overheads, combining the adaptivity of dynamic methods with the efficiency of static ones. We implement a highly optimized LiteAttention kernel on top of FlashAttention and demonstrate substantial speedups on production video diffusion models, with no degradation in quality. The code and implementation details will be publicly released.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of preventable blindness, with early detection critical for reducing vision loss worldwide. Over the past decade, deep learning has transformed DR screening, progressing from early convolutional neural networks trained on private datasets to advanced pipelines addressing class imbalance, label scarcity, domain shift, and interpretability. This survey provides the first systematic synthesis of DR research spanning 2016-2025, consolidating results from 50+ studies and over 20 datasets. We critically examine methodological advances, including self- and semi-supervised learning, domain generalization, federated training, and hybrid neuro-symbolic models, alongside evaluation protocols, reporting standards, and reproducibility challenges. Benchmark tables contextualize performance across datasets, while discussion highlights open gaps in multi-center validation and clinical trust. By linking technical progress with translational barriers, this work outlines a practical agenda for reproducible, privacy-preserving, and clinically deployable DR AI. Beyond DR, many of the surveyed innovations extend broadly to medical imaging at scale.

Abstract: Radiology Report Generation (RRG) aims to automatically generate diagnostic reports from radiology images. To achieve this, existing methods have leveraged the powerful cross-modal generation capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), primarily focusing on optimizing cross-modal alignment between radiographs and reports through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). However, by only performing instance-level alignment with the image-text pairs, the standard SFT paradigm fails to establish anatomically-grounded alignment, where the templated nature of reports often leads to sub-optimal generation quality. To address this, we propose \textsc{S2D-Align}, a novel SFT paradigm that establishes anatomically-grounded alignment by leveraging auxiliary signals of varying granularities. \textsc{S2D-Align} implements a shallow-to-deep strategy, progressively enriching the alignment process: it begins with the coarse radiograph-report pairing, then introduces reference reports for instance-level guidance, and ultimately utilizes key phrases to ground the generation in specific anatomical details. To bridge the different alignment stages, we introduce a memory-based adapter that empowers feature sharing, thereby integrating coarse and fine-grained guidance. For evaluation, we conduct experiments on the public \textsc{MIMIC-CXR} and \textsc{IU X-Ray} benchmarks, where \textsc{S2D-Align} achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of our multi-stage, auxiliary-guided approach, highlighting a promising direction for enhancing grounding capabilities in complex, multi-modal generation tasks.

Conclusion: 扩散模型在连续潜在空间中的多模态形状补全任务上达到最佳性能，而自回归模型在相同离散潜在空间下具有竞争力。

Abstract: While generative models have seen significant adoption across a wide range of data modalities, including 3D data, a consensus on which model is best suited for which task has yet to be reached. Further, conditional information such as text and images to steer the generation process are frequently employed, whereas others, like partial 3D data, have not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we compare two of the most promising generative models--Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models and Autoregressive Causal Transformers--which we adapt for the tasks of generative shape modeling and completion. We conduct a thorough quantitative evaluation and comparison of both tasks, including a baseline discriminative model and an extensive ablation study. Our results show that (1) the diffusion model with continuous latents outperforms both the discriminative model and the autoregressive approach and delivers state-of-the-art performance on multi-modal shape completion from a single, noisy depth image under realistic conditions and (2) when compared on the same discrete latent space, the autoregressive model can match or exceed diffusion performance on these tasks.

Abstract: Estimating the geometric and volumetric properties of transparent deformable liquids is challenging due to optical complexities and dynamic surface deformations induced by container movements. Autonomous robots performing precise liquid manipulation tasks, such as dispensing, aspiration, and mixing, must handle containers in ways that inevitably induce these deformations, complicating accurate liquid state assessment. Current datasets lack comprehensive physics-informed simulation data representing realistic liquid behaviors under diverse dynamic scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce Phys-Liquid, a physics-informed dataset comprising 97,200 simulation images and corresponding 3D meshes, capturing liquid dynamics across multiple laboratory scenes, lighting conditions, liquid colors, and container rotations. To validate the realism and effectiveness of Phys-Liquid, we propose a four-stage reconstruction and estimation pipeline involving liquid segmentation, multi-view mask generation, 3D mesh reconstruction, and real-world scaling. Experimental results demonstrate improved accuracy and consistency in reconstructing liquid geometry and volume, outperforming existing benchmarks. The dataset and associated validation methods facilitate future advancements in transparent liquid perception tasks.

Abstract: Meteorological agencies around the world rely on real-time flood guidance to issue live-saving advisories and warnings. For decades traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models have been state-of-the-art for precipitation forecasting. However, physically-parameterized models suffer from a few core limitations: first, solving PDEs to resolve atmospheric dynamics is computationally demanding, and second, these methods degrade in performance at nowcasting timescales (i.e., 0-4 hour lead-times). Motivated by these shortcomings, recent work proposes AI-weather prediction (AI-WP) alternatives that learn to emulate analysis data with neural networks. While these data-driven approaches have enjoyed enormous success across diverse spatial and temporal resolutions, applications of video-understanding architectures for weather forecasting remain underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose SaTformer: a video transformer built on full space-time attention that skillfully forecasts extreme precipitation from satellite radiances. Along with our novel architecture, we introduce techniques to tame long-tailed precipitation datasets. Namely, we reformulate precipitation regression into a classification problem, and employ a class-weighted loss to address label imbalances. Our model scored first place on the NeurIPS Weather4Cast 2025 Cumulative Rainfall challenge. Code and model weights are available: https://github.com/leharris3/satformer

In the RL stage, we introduce a novel process-aware group relative policy optimization (PA-GRPO) algorithm that supplies separate rewards for perception and reasoning. Extensive experiments show that VideoP2R achieves state-of-the-art (SotA) performance on six out of seven video reasoning and understanding benchmarks. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of our process-aware modeling and PA-GRPO and demonstrate that model's perception output is information-sufficient for downstream reasoning.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) in media has advanced rapidly over the last decade. The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) improved the quality of photorealistic image generation. Diffusion models later brought a new era of generative media. These advances made it difficult to separate real and synthetic content. The rise of deepfakes demonstrated how these tools could be misused to spread misinformation, political conspiracies, privacy violations, and fraud. For this reason, many detection models have been developed. They often use deep learning methods such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs). These models search for visual, spatial, or temporal anomalies. However, such approaches often fail to generalize across unseen data and struggle with content from different models. In addition, existing approaches are ineffective in multimodal data and highly modified content. This study reviews twenty-four recent works on AI-generated media detection. Each study was examined individually to identify its contributions and weaknesses, respectively. The review then summarizes the common limitations and key challenges faced by current approaches. Based on this analysis, a research direction is suggested with a focus on multimodal deep learning models. Such models have the potential to provide more robust and generalized detection. It offers future researchers a clear starting point for building stronger defenses against harmful synthetic media.

Abstract: Vectorized glyphs are widely used in poster design, network animation, art display, and various other fields due to their scalability and flexibility. In typography, they are often seen as special sequences composed of ordered strokes. This concept extends to the token sequence prediction abilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling vectorized character generation through stroke modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel Large Vectorized Glyph Model (LVGM) designed to generate vectorized Chinese glyphs by predicting the next stroke. Initially, we encode strokes into discrete latent variables called stroke embeddings. Subsequently, we train our LVGM via fine-tuning DeepSeek LLM by predicting the next stroke embedding. With limited strokes given, it can generate complete characters, semantically elegant words, and even unseen verses in vectorized form. Moreover, we release a new large-scale Chinese SVG dataset containing 907,267 samples based on strokes for dynamically vectorized glyph generation. Experimental results show that our model has scaling behaviors on data scales. Our generated vectorized glyphs have been validated by experts and relevant individuals.

TL;DR: HinD框架通过知识鼓励偏好优化(KEPO)激发多模态大语言模型内部的推理能力，在OK-VQA和A-OKVQA数据集上实现优越性能，无需商业模型API或外部知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KBVQA方法缺乏显式的多步推理轨迹，无法有效利用MLLMs的内部知识推理能力。

Method: 提出Hindsight Distilled Reasoning(HinD)框架：1) 构建Hindsight-Zero训练数据；2) 自蒸馏为思维链生成器和知识生成器；3) 使用KEPO优化知识生成器。

Result: 在OK-VQA和A-OKVQA数据集上验证了HinD的有效性，仅使用7B参数的MLLM即实现了优越性能。

Conclusion: HinD框架成功激发了MLLMs的内在知识推理能力，为KBVQA任务提供了有效的基于提示的推理范式。

Abstract: Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (KBVQA) necessitates external knowledge incorporation beyond cross-modal understanding. Existing KBVQA methods either utilize implicit knowledge in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) via in-context learning or explicit knowledge via retrieval augmented generation. However, their reasoning processes remain implicit, without explicit multi-step trajectories from MLLMs. To address this gap, we provide a Hindsight Distilled Reasoning (HinD) framework with Knowledge Encouragement Preference Optimization (KEPO), designed to elicit and harness internal knowledge reasoning ability in MLLMs. First, to tackle the reasoning supervision problem, we propose to emphasize the hindsight wisdom of MLLM by prompting a frozen 7B-size MLLM to complete the reasoning process between the question and its ground truth answer, constructing Hindsight-Zero training data. Then we self-distill Hindsight-Zero into Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Generator and Knowledge Generator, enabling the generation of sequential steps and discrete facts. Secondly, to tackle the misalignment between knowledge correctness and confidence, we optimize the Knowledge Generator with KEPO, preferring under-confident but helpful knowledge over the over-confident but unhelpful one. The generated CoT and sampled knowledge are then exploited for answer prediction. Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA validate the effectiveness of HinD, showing that HinD with elicited reasoning from 7B-size MLLM achieves superior performance without commercial model APIs or outside knowledge.

TL;DR: OT-ALD提出了一种基于最优传输理论的图像到图像翻译框架，通过消除潜在分布不匹配来提高DDIB方法的效率和准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DDIB方法在图像翻译中保持循环一致性和灵活性，但面临翻译效率低和潜在分布不匹配导致的轨迹偏差问题

Method: 利用最优传输理论计算从源域到目标域的潜在分布映射，将映射后的分布作为反向扩散过程的起始点

Result: 在三个高分辨率数据集的四个翻译任务中，OT-ALD相比基线模型平均提升20.29%的采样效率，降低2.6的FID得分

Conclusion: OT-ALD通过最优传输有效平衡了图像翻译速度与质量，消除了潜在分布不匹配问题

Abstract: The Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridge (DDIB) is an emerging image-to-image (I2I) translation method that preserves cycle consistency while achieving strong flexibility. It links two independently trained diffusion models (DMs) in the source and target domains by first adding noise to a source image to obtain a latent code, then denoising it in the target domain to generate the translated image. However, this method faces two key challenges: (1) low translation efficiency, and (2) translation trajectory deviations caused by mismatched latent distributions. To address these issues, we propose a novel I2I translation framework, OT-ALD, grounded in optimal transport (OT) theory, which retains the strengths of DDIB-based approach. Specifically, we compute an OT map from the latent distribution of the source domain to that of the target domain, and use the mapped distribution as the starting point for the reverse diffusion process in the target domain. Our error analysis confirms that OT-ALD eliminates latent distribution mismatches. Moreover, OT-ALD effectively balances faster image translation with improved image quality. Experiments on four translation tasks across three high-resolution datasets show that OT-ALD improves sampling efficiency by 20.29% and reduces the FID score by 2.6 on average compared to the top-performing baseline models.

TL;DR: MultiTypeFCDD是一个轻量级卷积框架，用图像级标签训练，通过多通道热图进行可解释的多类型异常检测，可区分特定异常类型且无需为每个对象类别单独训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可解释异常检测方法无法区分异常类型，且需为每个对象类别训练单独模型。识别异常类型对于准确诊断和节约成本至关重要，但现有大规模视觉语言模型计算密集型，无法用于实时或嵌入式系统。

Method: 提出MultiTypeFCDD框架，仅使用图像级标签训练，生成多通道热图，每个通道对应特定异常类型，作为统一的跨类别异常检测框架。

Result: 在Real-IAD数据集上的评估显示，该方法在显著降低参数量和推理时间的情况下，与最先进复杂模型竞争。

Conclusion: MultiTypeFCDD为计算资源受限的现实应用提供了高度实用和可行的解决方案，实现了轻量级的多类型异常检测。

Abstract: Most explainable anomaly detection methods often identify anomalies but lack the capability to differentiate the type of anomaly. Furthermore, they often require the costly training and maintenance of separate models for each object category. The lack of specificity is a significant research gap, as identifying the type of anomaly (e.g., "Crack" vs. "Scratch") is crucial for accurate diagnosis that facilitates cost-saving operational decisions across diverse application domains. While some recent large-scale Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have begun to address this, they are computationally intensive and memory-heavy, restricting their use in real-time or embedded systems. We propose MultiTypeFCDD, a simple and lightweight convolutional framework designed as a practical alternative for explainable multi-type anomaly detection. MultiTypeFCDD uses only image-level labels to learn and produce multi-channel heatmaps, where each channel is trained to correspond to a specific anomaly type. The model functions as a single, unified framework capable of differentiating anomaly types across multiple object categories, eliminating the need to train and manage separate models for each object category. We evaluated our proposed method on the Real-IAD dataset and it delivers results competitive with state-of-the-art complex models at significantly reduced parametric load and inference times. This makes it a highly practical and viable solution for real-world applications where computational resources are tightly constrained.

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) cooperative perception has great potential to enhance autonomous driving performance by overcoming perception limitations in complex adverse traffic scenarios (CATS). Meanwhile, data serves as the fundamental infrastructure for modern autonomous driving AI. However, due to stringent data collection requirements, existing datasets focus primarily on ordinary traffic scenarios, constraining the benefits of cooperative perception. To address this challenge, we introduce CATS-V2V, the first-of-its-kind real-world dataset for V2V cooperative perception under complex adverse traffic scenarios. The dataset was collected by two hardware time-synchronized vehicles, covering 10 weather and lighting conditions across 10 diverse locations. The 100-clip dataset includes 60K frames of 10 Hz LiDAR point clouds and 1.26M multi-view 30 Hz camera images, along with 750K anonymized yet high-precision RTK-fixed GNSS and IMU records. Correspondingly, we provide time-consistent 3D bounding box annotations for objects, as well as static scenes to construct a 4D BEV representation. On this basis, we propose a target-based temporal alignment method, ensuring that all objects are precisely aligned across all sensor modalities. We hope that CATS-V2V, the largest-scale, most supportive, and highest-quality dataset of its kind to date, will benefit the autonomous driving community in related tasks.

Motivation: 现有的多视角视频重建方法假设输入视频流在时间上同步，但在实际场景中由于相机触发延迟或独立录制设置等因素，视图间存在时序不对齐问题，导致重建质量下降。

Method: 采用粗到精的对齐模块，首先确定帧级的粗略偏移，然后细化为亚帧精度。该方法可作为一个即插即用模块集成到现有的4D高斯泼溅框架中。

Conclusion: 提出的时序对齐策略能够增强4DGS方法在处理异步数据时的鲁棒性，为现实中常见的未同步多视角视频重建提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-view video reconstruction plays a vital role in computer vision, enabling applications in film production, virtual reality, and motion analysis. While recent advances such as 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in dynamic scene reconstruction, they typically rely on the assumption that input video streams are temporally synchronized. However, in real-world scenarios, this assumption often fails due to factors like camera trigger delays or independent recording setups, leading to temporal misalignment across views and reduced reconstruction quality. To address this challenge, a novel temporal alignment strategy is proposed for high-quality 4DGS reconstruction from unsynchronized multi-view videos. Our method features a coarse-to-fine alignment module that estimates and compensates for each camera's time shift. The method first determines a coarse, frame-level offset and then refines it to achieve sub-frame accuracy. This strategy can be integrated as a readily integrable module into existing 4DGS frameworks, enhancing their robustness when handling asynchronous data. Experiments show that our approach effectively processes temporally misaligned videos and significantly enhances baseline methods.

Conclusion: Viper-F1通过高效的架构设计和增强的视觉定位能力，实现了细粒度视觉语言理解和高效率的平衡。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled impressive progress in vision-language understanding, yet their high computational cost limits deployment in resource-constrained scenarios such as robotic manipulation, personal assistants, and smart cameras. Most existing methods rely on Transformer-based cross-attention, whose quadratic complexity hinders efficiency. Moreover, small vision-language models often struggle to precisely capture fine-grained, task-relevant visual regions, leading to degraded performance on fine-grained reasoning tasks that limit their effectiveness in the real world. To address these issues, we introduce Viper-F1, a Hybrid State-Space Vision-Language Model that replaces attention with efficient Liquid State-Space Dynamics. To further enhance visual grounding, we propose a Token-Grid Correlation Module, which computes lightweight correlations between text tokens and image patches and modulates the state-space dynamics via FiLM conditioning. This enables the model to selectively emphasize visual regions relevant to the textual prompt while maintaining linear-time inference. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Viper-F1 achieves accurate, fine-grained understanding with significantly improved efficiency.

Abstract: This paper is a submission for the Weather4Cast~2025 complementary Pollution Task and presents an efficient framework for 6-hour lead-time nowcasting of PM$_1$, PM$_{2.5}$, and PM$_{10}$ across the Indian subcontinent and surrounding regions. The proposed approach leverages analysis fields from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) Global Atmospheric Composition Forecasts at 0.4 degree resolution. A 256x256 spatial region, covering 28.4S-73.6N and 32E-134.0E, is used as the model input, while predictions are generated for the central 128x128 area spanning 2.8S-48N and 57.6E-108.4E, ensuring an India-centric forecast domain with sufficient synoptic-scale context. Models are trained on CAMS analyses from 2021-2023 using a shuffled 90/10 split and independently evaluated on 2024 data. Three lightweight parameter-specific architectures are developed to improve accuracy, minimize systematic bias, and enable rapid inference. Evaluation using RMSE, MAE, Bias, and SSIM demonstrates substantial performance gains over the Aurora foundation model, underscoring the effectiveness of compact & specialized deep learning models for short-range forecasts on limited spatial domains.

Abstract: This study presents a transfer-learning framework based on Convolutional Gated Recurrent Units (ConvGRU) for short-term rainfall prediction in the Weather4Cast 2025 competition. A single SEVIRI infrared channel (10.8 μm wavelength) is used as input, which consists of four observations over a one-hour period. A two-stage training strategy is applied to generate rainfall estimates up to four hours ahead. In the first stage, ConvGRU is trained to forecast the brightness temperatures from SEVIRI, enabling the model to capture relevant spatiotemporal patterns. In the second stage, an empirically derived nonlinear transformation maps the predicted fields to OPERA-compatible rainfall rates.
  For the event-prediction task, the transformed rainfall forecasts are processed using 3D event detection followed by spatiotemporal feature extraction to identify and characterize precipitation events. Our submission achieved 2nd place in the cumulative rainfall task. Further, the same model was used out-of-the-box for the event prediction task, and resulted in similar scores as the baseline model to the competition.

Abstract: Geospatial chain of thought (CoT) reasoning is essential for advancing Visual Question Answering (VQA) on satellite imagery, particularly in climate related applications such as disaster monitoring, infrastructure risk assessment, urban resilience planning, and policy support. Existing VQA models enable scalable interpretation of remote sensing data but often lack the structured reasoning required for complex geospatial queries. We propose a VQA framework that integrates CoT reasoning with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to improve interpretability, robustness, and accuracy. By generating intermediate rationales, the model better handles tasks involving detection, classification, spatial relations, and comparative analysis, which are critical for reliable decision support in high stakes climate domains. Experiments show that CoT supervision improves accuracy by 34.9\% over direct baselines, while DPO yields additional gains in accuracy and reasoning quality. The resulting system advances VQA for multispectral Earth observation by enabling richer geospatial reasoning and more effective climate use cases.

Abstract: High-fidelity gaze redirection is critical for generating augmented data to improve the generalization of gaze estimators. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models like GazeGaussian represent the state-of-the-art but can struggle with rendering subtle, continuous gaze shifts. In this paper, we propose DiT-Gaze, a framework that enhances 3D gaze redirection models using a novel combination of Diffusion Transformer (DiT), weak supervision across gaze angles, and an orthogonality constraint loss. DiT allows higher-fidelity image synthesis, while our weak supervision strategy using synthetically generated intermediate gaze angles provides a smooth manifold of gaze directions during training. The orthogonality constraint loss mathematically enforces the disentanglement of internal representations for gaze, head pose, and expression. Comprehensive experiments show that DiT-Gaze sets a new state-of-the-art in both perceptual quality and redirection accuracy, reducing the state-of-the-art gaze error by 4.1% to 6.353 degrees, providing a superior method for creating synthetic training data. Our code and models will be made available for the research community to benchmark against.

Motivation: 虽然视觉语言模型取得了显著进展，但其在保持语义不变的小规模输入变化下的可靠性仍未被充分理解，需要系统评估其鲁棒性。

Method: 通过大规模的对抗扰动测试，分析像素级偏移、几何变换、缩放填充、转述和多语言重写等扰动对模型预测的影响。

Result: 现代VLM对微小扰动高度敏感，大量样本在至少一种扰动下会改变预测答案；稳定性与正确率强相关；小模型的稳定性模式可预测大模型的正确性。

Conclusion: 当前VLM存在基础脆弱性，需要超越对抗性扰动的鲁棒性评估，关注模型应该可靠保持的不变性。

Abstract: Visual Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress, yet their reliability under small, meaning-preserving input changes remains poorly understood. We present the first large-scale, systematic study of VLM robustness to benign visual and textual perturbations: pixel-level shifts, light geometric transformations, padded rescaling, paraphrasing, and multilingual rewrites that do not alter the underlying semantics of an image-question pair. Across a broad set of models and datasets, we find that modern VLMs are highly sensitive to such minor perturbations: a substantial fraction of samples change their predicted answer under at least one visual or textual modification. We characterize how this instability varies across perturbation types, question categories, and models, revealing that even state-of-the-art systems (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini 2.0 Flash) frequently fail under shifts as small as a few pixels or harmless rephrasings. We further show that sample-level stability serves as a strong indicator of correctness: stable samples are consistently far more likely to be answered correctly. Leveraging this, we demonstrate that the stability patterns of small, accessible open-source models can be used to predict the correctness of much larger closed-source models with high precision. Our findings expose a fundamental fragility in current VLMs and highlight the need for robustness evaluations that go beyond adversarial perturbations, focusing instead on invariances that models should reliably uphold.

Abstract: Backdoor attacks represent a critical threat to deep learning systems, particularly in safety-sensitive 3D domains such as autonomous driving and robotics. However, existing backdoor attacks for 3D point clouds have been limited to a rigid one-to-one paradigm. To address this, we present the first one-to-N backdoor framework for 3D vision, based on a novel, configurable spherical trigger. Our key insight is to leverage the spatial properties of spheres as a parameter space, allowing a single trigger design to encode multiple target classes. We establish a theoretical foundation for one-to-N backdoor attacks in 3D, demonstrating that poisoned models can map distinct trigger configurations to different target labels. Experimental results systematically validate this conclusion across multiple datasets and model architectures, achieving high attack success rates (up to 100\%) while maintaining accuracy on clean data. This work establishes a crucial benchmark for multi-target threats in 3D vision and provides the foundational understanding needed to secure future 3D-driven intelligent systems.

Abstract: Foundational models are trained on extensive datasets to capture the general trends of a domain. However, in medical imaging, the scarcity of data makes pre-training for every domain, modality, or task challenging. Instead of building separate models, we propose MAFM^3 (Modular Adaptation of Foundation Models for Multi-Modal Medical AI), a framework that enables a single foundation model to expand into diverse domains, tasks, and modalities through lightweight modular components. These components serve as specialized skill sets that allow the system to flexibly activate the appropriate capability at the inference time, depending on the input type or clinical objective. Unlike conventional adaptation methods that treat each new task or modality in isolation, MAFM^3 provides a unified and expandable framework for efficient multitask and multimodality adaptation. Empirically, we validate our approach by adapting a chest CT foundation model initially trained for classification into prognosis and segmentation modules. Our results show improved performance on both tasks. Furthermore, by incorporating PET scans, MAFM^3 achieved an improvement in the Dice score 5% compared to the respective baselines. These findings establish that foundation models, when equipped with modular components, are not inherently constrained to their initial training scope but can evolve into multitask, multimodality systems for medical imaging.

Abstract: The automatic detection of gaze targets in autistic children through artificial intelligence can be impactful, especially for those who lack access to a sufficient number of professionals to improve their quality of life. This paper introduces a new, real-world AI application for gaze target detection in autistic children, which predicts a child's point of gaze from an activity image. This task is foundational for building automated systems that can measure joint attention-a core challenge in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). To facilitate the study of this challenging application, we collected the first-ever Autism Gaze Target (AGT) dataset. We further propose a novel Socially Aware Coarse-to-Fine (SACF) gaze detection framework that explicitly leverages the social context of a scene to overcome the class imbalance common in autism datasets-a consequence of autistic children's tendency to show reduced gaze to faces. It utilizes a two-pathway architecture with expert models specialized in social and non-social gaze, guided by a context-awareness gate module. The results of our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance for gaze target detection in this population, significantly outperforming existing methods, especially on the critical minority class of face-directed gaze.

Conclusion: GSD框架成功利用视频扩散模型的一致性先验知识，通过深度和语义指导修正了生成方向，提升了稀疏视图下3D场景表示的质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently gained great attention in the 3D scene representation for its high-quality real-time rendering capabilities. However, when the input comprises sparse training views, 3DGS is prone to overfitting, primarily due to the lack of intermediate-view supervision. Inspired by the recent success of Video Diffusion Models (VDM), we propose a framework called Guidance Score Distillation (GSD) to extract the rich multi-view consistency priors from pretrained VDMs. Building on the insights from Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), GSD supervises rendered images from multiple neighboring views, guiding the Gaussian splatting representation towards the generative direction of VDM. However, the generative direction often involves object motion and random camera trajectories, making it challenging for direct supervision in the optimization process. To address this problem, we introduce an unified guidance form to correct the noise prediction result of VDM. Specifically, we incorporate both a depth warp guidance based on real depth maps and a guidance based on semantic image features, ensuring that the score update direction from VDM aligns with the correct camera pose and accurate geometry. Experimental results show that our method outperforms existing approaches across multiple datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探索了多模态表示模型中的位置偏见，特别是在图像-文本检索任务中。研究表明多模态模型普遍存在位置偏见，但文本编码器倾向偏向前端输入，而图像编码器则在两端都显示偏见。

Motivation: 虽然已有研究广泛探讨文本生成模型的位置偏见，但多模态表示模型中的位置偏见及其影响尚不明确。本研究旨在填补这一空白，重点关注图像-文本检索场景。

Method: 首先区分上下文重要性和位置偏见，然后评估不同模型和数据集中的位置偏见存在程度。实验分析涵盖多种多模态模型，考察文本编码器和图像编码器的不同表现模式。

Result: 实验证明多模态模型普遍存在位置偏见：文本编码器偏向前端输入，图像编码器在两端都显示偏见。这种偏见源于位置编码方案、训练损失、上下文重要性以及多模态训练中图像-文本对的使用方式等多种因素。

Conclusion: 多模态表示模型确实存在显著的位置偏见，且在不同模态中表现出不同模式。理解这些偏见来源对于改进模型设计和缓解偏见影响至关重要。

Abstract: Positional bias - where models overemphasize certain positions regardless of content - has been shown to negatively impact model performance across various tasks. While recent research has extensively examined positional bias in text generation models, its presence and effects in representation models remain underexplored. Even less is known about such biases in multimodal models. In this work, we investigate positional bias in multimodal representation models, specifically in the context of image-text retrieval. We begin by distinguishing between context importance and positional bias, and then assess the presence and extent of positional bias across different models and datasets. Our experiments demonstrate that positional bias is prevalent in multimodal models, but manifests differently across modalities: text encoders tend to exhibit bias toward the beginning of the input, whereas image encoders show bias at both the beginning and end. Furthermore, we find that this bias arises from, or is amplified by, a combination of factors, including the positional encoding scheme, training loss, context importance, and the nature of using image-text pairs in multimodal training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型的数据集常包含敏感或受版权保护内容，由于法规要求的'被遗忘权'，需要机器学习遗忘技术。然而，视觉概念遗忘在MLLMs中尚未充分研究，主要挑战是精确删除目标视觉概念而不影响相关实体性能。

Method: 提出了AUVIC框架，采用对抗扰动实现精确遗忘目标视觉概念的方法，有效隔离目标概念同时避免对相似实体的意外影响。

Result: 实验结果表明，AUVIC在目标遗忘率上达到最先进水平，同时对非目标概念的退化最小。构建了VCUBench基准，这是第一个评估群组上下文中视觉概念遗忘的基准。

Conclusion: AUVIC框架成功解决了MLLMs中视觉概念遗忘的挑战，为实现'被遗忘权'提供了有效解决方案，在目标遗忘和性能保持之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve impressive performance once optimized on massive datasets. Such datasets often contain sensitive or copyrighted content, raising significant data privacy concerns. Regulatory frameworks mandating the 'right to be forgotten' drive the need for machine unlearning. This technique allows for the removal of target data without resource-consuming retraining. However, while well-studied for text, visual concept unlearning in MLLMs remains underexplored. A primary challenge is precisely removing a target visual concept without disrupting model performance on related entities. To address this, we introduce AUVIC, a novel visual concept unlearning framework for MLLMs. AUVIC applies adversarial perturbations to enable precise forgetting. This approach effectively isolates the target concept while avoiding unintended effects on similar entities. To evaluate our method, we construct VCUBench. It is the first benchmark designed to assess visual concept unlearning in group contexts. Experimental results demonstrate that AUVIC achieves state-of-the-art target forgetting rates while incurs minimal performance degradation on non-target concepts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决3D深度学习在多领域泛化的限制问题，现有数据集规模有限且多源点云存在高度异构性（密度和噪声分布差异），导致跨领域融合时出现负迁移。

Method: DoReMi框架包含：1）域感知专家分支通过域引导空间路由动态激活；2）统一表示分支通过鲁棒多属性自监督预训练；3）熵控制动态分配确保专家稳定高效利用。

Result: 在ScanNet Val上达到80.1% mIoU，在S3DIS上达到77.2% mIoU，性能优于现有方法，显示作为3D理解基础框架的潜力。

Conclusion: DoReMi通过域感知专家和统一表示的协作学习，成功建模多样化域分布，保留跨域几何和结构先验，在3D多领域理解中展现强大潜力。

Abstract: The generalization of 3D deep learning across multiple domains remains limited by the limited scale of existing datasets and the high heterogeneity of multi-source point clouds. Point clouds collected from different sensors (e.g., LiDAR scans and mesh-derived point clouds) exhibit substantial discrepancies in density and noise distribution, resulting in negative transfer during multi-domain fusion. Most existing approaches focus exclusively on either domain-aware or domain-general features, overlooking the potential synergy between them. To address this, we propose DoReMi (Domain-Representation Mixture), a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that jointly models Domain-aware Experts branch and a unified Representation branch to enable cooperative learning between specialized and generalizable knowledge. DoReMi dynamically activates domain-aware expert branch via Domain-Guided Spatial Routing (DSR) for context-aware expert selection and employs Entropy-Controlled Dynamic Allocation (EDA) for stable and efficient expert utilization, thereby adaptively modeling diverse domain distributions. Complemented by a frozen unified representation branch pretrained through robust multi-attribute self-supervised learning, DoReMi preserves cross-domain geometric and structural priors while maintaining global consistency. We evaluate DoReMi across multiple 3D understanding benchmarks. Notably, DoReMi achieves 80.1% mIoU on ScanNet Val and 77.2% mIoU on S3DIS, demonstrating competitive or superior performance compared to existing approaches, and showing strong potential as a foundation framework for future 3D understanding research. The code will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文本到图像扩散模型中泛化与记忆化之间的模糊性，特别关注文化共享关联的多模态图标性现象，研究模型如何在识别文化参考与复制它们之间取得平衡。

Method: 引入评估框架分离识别与实现两个维度，评估五个扩散模型在767个维基数据衍生的文化参考上的表现，通过提示扰动实验（同义词替换和字面图像描述）评估语言敏感性，分析训练数据频率、文本独特性、参考流行度和创建日期等因素与文化对齐的相关性。

Result: 评估框架比现有基于相似性的方法更有效地区分复制与转换，模型即使改变文本提示也经常复制标志性视觉结构，文化对齐不仅与训练数据频率相关，还与文本独特性、参考流行度和创建日期相关。

Conclusion: 扩散模型的价值不仅在于复制文化知识，还在于它们如何转化和重新语境化文化知识，推动评估从简单的文本-图像匹配向更丰富的语境理解发展。

Abstract: Our work addresses the ambiguity between generalization and memorization in text-to-image diffusion models, focusing on a specific case we term multimodal iconicity. This refers to instances where images and texts evoke culturally shared associations, such as when a title recalls a familiar artwork or film scene. While prior research on memorization and unlearning emphasizes forgetting, we examine what is remembered and how, focusing on the balance between recognizing cultural references and reproducing them. We introduce an evaluation framework that separates recognition, whether a model identifies a reference, from realization, how it depicts it through replication or reinterpretation, quantified through measures capturing both dimensions. By evaluating five diffusion models across 767 Wikidata-derived cultural references spanning static and dynamic imagery, we show that our framework distinguishes replication from transformation more effectively than existing similarity-based methods. To assess linguistic sensitivity, we conduct prompt perturbation experiments using synonym substitutions and literal image descriptions, finding that models often reproduce iconic visual structures even when textual cues are altered. Finally, our analysis shows that cultural alignment correlates not only with training data frequency, but also textual uniqueness, reference popularity, and creation date. Our work reveals that the value of diffusion models lies not only in what they reproduce but in how they transform and recontextualize cultural knowledge, advancing evaluation beyond simple text-image matching toward richer contextual understanding.

Result: 实验结果表明，所提方法在显著减少LoRA参数的情况下，性能优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: MoE LoRA框架在多风格图像编辑任务中具有优越性，能够有效利用有限数据进行风格适应

Abstract: In recent years, image editing has garnered growing attention. However, general image editing models often fail to produce satisfactory results when confronted with new styles. The challenge lies in how to effectively fine-tune general image editing models to new styles using only a limited amount of paired data. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel few-shot style editing framework. For this task, we construct a benchmark dataset that encompasses five distinct styles. Correspondingly, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-style Mixture-of-Experts Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE LoRA) with style-specific and style-shared routing mechanisms for jointly fine-tuning multiple styles. The style-specific routing ensures that different styles do not interfere with one another, while the style-shared routing adaptively allocates shared MoE LoRAs to learn common patterns. Our MoE LoRA can automatically determine the optimal ranks for each layer through a novel metric-guided approach that estimates the importance score of each single-rank component. Additionally, we explore the optimal location to insert LoRA within the Diffusion in Transformer (DiT) model and integrate adversarial learning and flow matching to guide the diffusion training process. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches with significantly fewer LoRA parameters.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型基于'平面'感知构建，难以理解真实3D空间智能，存在输入阶段几何感知编码器与2D特征的冲突，以及输出阶段离散分词器无法生成精确连续数值的问题

Method: 引入GEODE架构，包含解耦推理模块DRM和直接回归头DRH。DRM作为空间协处理器，对齐3D数据与2D视觉特征并提取空间思维链逻辑；DRH采用'嵌入即值'范式，通过轻量MLP精确回归标量和3D边界框

Conclusion: GEODE通过解耦架构设计有效解决了3D空间推理的双重瓶颈，为视觉语言模型提供了更强大的几何和数值理解能力

Abstract: Existing Vision Language Models (VLMs) architecturally rooted in "flatland" perception, fundamentally struggle to comprehend real-world 3D spatial intelligence. This failure stems from a dual-bottleneck: input-stage conflict between computationally exorbitant geometric-aware encoders and superficial 2D-only features, and output-stage misalignment where discrete tokenizers are structurally incapable of producing precise, continuous numerical values. To break this impasse, we introduce GEODE (Geometric-Output and Decoupled-Input Engine), a novel architecture that resolves this dual-bottleneck by decoupling 3D reasoning from numerical generation. GEODE augments main VLM with two specialized, plug-and-play modules: Decoupled Rationale Module (DRM) that acts as spatial co-processor, aligning explicit 3D data with 2D visual features via cross-attention and distilling spatial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) logic into injectable Rationale Tokens; and Direct Regression Head (DRH), an "Embedding-as-Value" paradigm which routes specialized control tokens to a lightweight MLP for precise, continuous regression of scalars and 3D bounding boxes. The synergy of these modules allows our 1.5B parameter model to function as a high-level semantic dispatcher, achieving state-of-the-art spatial reasoning performance that rivals 7B+ models.

Method: 引入CountSteer方法，利用模型自身对数字准确性的潜在感知，在推理过程中引导交叉注意力隐藏状态

Result: 实验显示CountSteer将物体计数准确率提高了约4%，同时不损害视觉质量

Conclusion: CountSteer为实现更可控和语义可靠的文本到图像生成提供了一个简单而有效的步骤

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models generate realistic and coherent images but often fail to follow numerical instructions in text, revealing a gap between language and visual representation. Interestingly, we found that these models are not entirely blind to numbers-they are implicitly aware of their own counting accuracy, as their internal signals shift in consistent ways depending on whether the output meets the specified count. This observation suggests that the model already encodes a latent notion of numerical correctness, which can be harnessed to guide generation more precisely. Building on this intuition, we introduce CountSteer, a training-free method that improves generation of specified object counts by steering the model's cross-attention hidden states during inference. In our experiments, CountSteer improved object-count accuracy by about 4% without compromising visual quality, demonstrating a simple yet effective step toward more controllable and semantically reliable text-to-image generation.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注将图像块与语言标记对齐，但图像块对人类没有意义，单个标记也不一定包含可直接在图像中定位的信息。需要捕捉描述场景不同方面的标记组来获得更好的细粒度理解。

Method: 设计了一个在架构中自动对字幕标记进行分组的模型，期望这些表示达到图像中对象的级别，并将其与经过训练以发现对象的图像编码器的输出对齐。

Result: 通过学会分组标记，视觉语言模型在视觉和语言的细粒度理解方面表现更好。模型发现的标记组与文本中可定位短语高度相似，定性和定量结果都证实了这一点。

Conclusion: 通过学习对标记进行分组，可以显着提升视觉语言模型的细粒度理解能力，所发现的标记组能够有效对应文本中的可定位短语，为细粒度视觉-语言理解提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Fine-grained knowledge is crucial for vision-language models to obtain a better understanding of the real world. While there has been work trying to acquire this kind of knowledge in the space of vision and language, it has mostly focused on aligning the image patches with the tokens on the language side. However, image patches do not have any meaning to the human eye, and individual tokens do not necessarily carry groundable information in the image. It is groups of tokens which describe different aspects of the scene. In this work, we propose a model which groups the caption tokens as part of its architecture in order to capture a fine-grained representation of the language. We expect our representations to be at the level of objects present in the image, and therefore align our representations with the output of an image encoder trained to discover objects. We show that by learning to group the tokens, the vision-language model has a better fine-grained understanding of vision and language. In addition, the token groups that our model discovers are highly similar to groundable phrases in text, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型存在目标幻觉问题，发现模型在预测新目标时经常忽视图像内容，而是依赖前序生成的token进行推断

Method: 基于互信息分析图像与目标预测的关系，提出Prelim Attention Score (PAS)，利用对前序tokens的注意力权重作为轻量级、无需训练的检测信号

Result: PAS在多个模型和数据集上实现了最先进的目标幻觉检测性能，能够实时进行过滤和干预

Conclusion: PAS提供了一种有效检测LVLM目标幻觉的方法，展示了利用注意力机制改进模型可靠性的潜力

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs) are powerful, yet they remain unreliable due to object hallucinations. In this work, we show that in many hallucinatory predictions the LVLM effectively ignores the image and instead relies on previously generated output (prelim) tokens to infer new objects. We quantify this behavior via the mutual information between the image and the predicted object conditioned on the prelim, demonstrating that weak image dependence strongly correlates with hallucination. Building on this finding, we introduce the Prelim Attention Score (PAS), a lightweight, training-free signal computed from attention weights over prelim tokens. PAS requires no additional forward passes and can be computed on the fly during inference. Exploiting this previously overlooked signal, PAS achieves state-of-the-art object-hallucination detection across multiple models and datasets, enabling real-time filtering and intervention.

Conclusion: 场景图调节训练能帮助模型更好地内化和基化关系先验，显著提升自动驾驶性能，证明了关系监督在自动驾驶规划中的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-language models have recently emerged as promising planners for autonomous driving, where success hinges on topology-aware reasoning over spatial structure and dynamic interactions from multimodal input. However, existing models are typically trained without supervision that explicitly encodes these relational dependencies, limiting their ability to infer how agents and other traffic entities influence one another from raw sensor data. In this work, we bridge this gap with a novel model-agnostic method that conditions language-based driving models on structured relational context in the form of traffic scene graphs. We serialize scene graphs at various abstraction levels and formats, and incorporate them into the models via structured prompt templates, enabling a systematic analysis of when and how relational supervision is most beneficial. Extensive evaluations on the public LangAuto benchmark show that scene graph conditioning of state-of-the-art approaches yields large and persistent improvement in driving performance. Notably, we observe up to a 15.6\% increase in driving score for LMDrive and 17.5\% for BEVDriver, indicating that models can better internalize and ground relational priors through scene graph-conditioned training, even without requiring scene graph input at test-time. Code, fine-tuned models, and our scene graph dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/iis-esslingen/GraphPilot.

Conclusion: CORAL通过学习切片间关系产生解剖学知情的表示，有利于下游分割任务，并能学习具有有意义解剖结构的表示。

Abstract: Volumetric medical image segmentation presents unique challenges due to the inherent anatomical structure and limited availability of annotations. While recent methods have shown promise by contrasting spatial relationships between slices, they rely on hard binary thresholds to define positive and negative samples, thereby discarding valuable continuous information about anatomical similarity. Moreover, these methods overlook the global directional consistency of anatomical progression, resulting in distorted feature spaces that fail to capture the canonical anatomical manifold shared across patients. To address these limitations, we propose Coordinative Ordinal-Relational Anatomical Learning (CORAL) to capture both local and global structure in volumetric images. First, CORAL employs a contrastive ranking objective to leverage continuous anatomical similarity, ensuring relational feature distances between slices are proportional to their anatomical position differences. In addition, CORAL incorporates an ordinal objective to enforce global directional consistency, aligning the learned feature distribution with the canonical anatomical progression across patients. Learning these inter-slice relationships produces anatomically informed representations that benefit the downstream segmentation task. Through this coordinative learning framework, CORAL achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets under limited-annotation settings while learning representations with meaningful anatomical structure. Code is available at https://github.com/haoyiwang25/CORAL.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BOFA提出了一种面向类增量学习的CLIP适配框架，通过仅调整CLIP的跨模态桥接层并使用正交低秩融合机制，在不增加参数和推理成本的情况下实现稳定知识积累与抗遗忘能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 类增量学习需要在不断学习新类别时不忘记旧知识。CLIP等视觉-语言模型虽有强大迁移能力，但直接应用于CIL存在两个挑战：需要额外可学习模块增加复杂性和遗忘风险，以及跨模态表示潜力未被充分挖掘。

Method: BOFA框架仅调整CLIP的现有跨模态桥接层，不增加额外参数。采用正交低秩融合机制，限制参数更新在低秩“安全子空间”内，该子空间与过去任务特征正交。使用跨模态混合原型，结合稳定文本原型和来自稳定适配桥接层的视觉原型。

Result: 在标准基准测试上的广泛实验表明，BOFA在准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: BOFA通过创新性地利用CLIP现有桥接层并设计正交低秩融合机制，成功实现了无需数据回放的稳定类增量学习，在性能和效率上达到优越水平。

Abstract: Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to continually learn new categories without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. Vision-language models such as CLIP offer strong transferable representations via multi-modal supervision, making them promising for CIL. However, applying CLIP to CIL poses two major challenges: (1) adapting to downstream tasks often requires additional learnable modules, increasing model complexity and susceptibility to forgetting; and (2) while multi-modal representations offer complementary strengths, existing methods have yet to fully realize their potential in effectively integrating visual and textual modalities. To address these issues, we propose BOFA (Bridge-layer Orthogonal Fusion for Adaptation), a novel framework for CIL. BOFA confines all model adaptation exclusively to CLIP's existing cross-modal bridge-layer, thereby adding no extra parameters or inference cost. To prevent forgetting within this layer, it leverages Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion, a mechanism that constrains parameter updates to a low-rank ``safe subspace" mathematically constructed to be orthogonal to past task features. This ensures stable knowledge accumulation without data replay. Furthermore, BOFA employs a cross-modal hybrid prototype that synergizes stable textual prototypes with visual counterparts derived from our stably adapted bridge-layer, enhancing classification performance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that BOFA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: SimuFreeMark通过利用低频分量稳定性，实现了无需噪声模拟的鲁棒水印方案，有效解决了现有方法的泛化局限

Abstract: The advancement of artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) has created a pressing need for robust image watermarking that can withstand both conventional signal processing and novel semantic editing attacks. Current deep learning-based methods rely on training with hand-crafted noise simulation layers, which inherently limit their generalization to unforeseen distortions. In this work, we propose $\textbf{SimuFreeMark}$, a noise-$\underline{\text{simu}}$lation-$\underline{\text{free}}$ water$\underline{\text{mark}}$ing framework that circumvents this limitation by exploiting the inherent stability of image low-frequency components. We first systematically establish that low-frequency components exhibit significant robustness against a wide range of attacks. Building on this foundation, SimuFreeMark embeds watermarks directly into the deep feature space of the low-frequency components, leveraging a pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE) to bind the watermark with structurally stable image representations. This design completely eliminates the need for noise simulation during training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimuFreeMark outperforms state-of-the-art methods across a wide range of conventional and semantic attacks, while maintaining superior visual quality.

Abstract: Chess has experienced a large increase in viewership since the pandemic, driven largely by the accessibility of online learning platforms. However, no equivalent assistance exists for physical chess games, creating a divide between analog and digital chess experiences. This paper presents CVChess, a deep learning framework for converting chessboard images to Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN), which is later input into online chess engines to provide you with the best next move. Our approach employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) with residual layers to perform piece recognition from smartphone camera images. The system processes RGB images of a physical chess board through a multistep process: image preprocessing using the Hough Line Transform for edge detection, projective transform to achieve a top-down board alignment, segmentation into 64 individual squares, and piece classification into 13 classes (6 unique white pieces, 6 unique black pieces and an empty square) using the residual CNN. Residual connections help retain low-level visual features while enabling deeper feature extraction, improving accuracy and stability during training. We train and evaluate our model using the Chess Recognition Dataset (ChessReD), containing 10,800 annotated smartphone images captured under diverse lighting conditions and angles. The resulting classifications are encoded as an FEN string, which can be fed into a chess engine to generate the most optimal move

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大视觉语言模型在长文档理解方面表现优异，但内存占用过高，无法在资源受限的边缘设备上部署。DocSLM旨在解决这一问题，为边缘设备提供高效的多模态文档理解能力。

Method: DocSLM采用层次化多模态压缩器，将每页的视觉、文本和布局信息联合编码为固定长度序列。同时引入基于熵的不确定性校准器的流式弃权机制，可顺序处理任意长文档片段并过滤低置信度响应。

Conclusion: DocSLM证明了在不牺牲性能的前提下显著减少资源消耗是可行的，为在资源受限设备上部署高效多模态文档理解系统提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated strong multimodal reasoning capabilities on long and complex documents. However, their high memory footprint makes them impractical for deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. We present DocSLM, an efficient Small Vision-Language Model designed for long-document understanding under constrained memory resources. DocSLM incorporates a Hierarchical Multimodal Compressor that jointly encodes visual, textual, and layout information from each page into a fixed-length sequence, greatly reducing memory consumption while preserving both local and global semantics. To enable scalable processing over arbitrarily long inputs, we introduce a Streaming Abstention mechanism that operates on document segments sequentially and filters low-confidence responses using an entropy-based uncertainty calibrator. Across multiple long multimodal document benchmarks, DocSLM matches or surpasses state-of-the-art methods while using 82\% fewer visual tokens, 75\% fewer parameters, and 71\% lower latency, delivering reliable multimodal document understanding on lightweight edge devices.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了YCB-Ev SD数据集，这是一个用于6DoF物体姿态估计的标准分辨率事件相机合成数据集，包含50,000个事件序列，填补了事件视觉领域缺乏综合数据资源的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件视觉领域缺乏类似于帧基计算机视觉中的综合合成数据集资源，这限制了对事件相机数据进行6DoF物体姿态估计的研究进展。

Method: 基于物理渲染(PBR)场景生成50,000个34毫秒持续时间的事件序列，采用模拟线性相机运动确保完整场景覆盖，包括背景活动，遵循BOP方法学评估事件表示方法。

Result: 研究发现线性衰减时间表面配合双通道极性编码在基于CNN的姿态估计中表现最佳，显著优于指数衰减和单通道替代方案，极性信息对性能提升贡献最大。

Conclusion: YCB-Ev SD数据集提供了一个结构化格式的事件数据资源，包括原始事件流和预计算的最优表示，可用于即时研究和可重复基准测试。

Abstract: We introduce YCB-Ev SD, a synthetic dataset of event-camera data at standard definition (SD) resolution for 6DoF object pose estimation. While synthetic data has become fundamental in frame-based computer vision, event-based vision lacks comparable comprehensive resources. Addressing this gap, we present 50,000 event sequences of 34 ms duration each, synthesized from Physically Based Rendering (PBR) scenes of YCB-Video objects following the Benchmark for 6D Object Pose (BOP) methodology. Our generation framework employs simulated linear camera motion to ensure complete scene coverage, including background activity.
  Through systematic evaluation of event representations for CNN-based inference, we demonstrate that time-surfaces with linear decay and dual-channel polarity encoding achieve superior pose estimation performance, outperforming exponential decay and single-channel alternatives by significant margins. Our analysis reveals that polarity information contributes most substantially to performance gains, while linear temporal encoding preserves critical motion information more effectively than exponential decay. The dataset is provided in a structured format with both raw event streams and precomputed optimal representations to facilitate immediate research use and reproducible benchmarking.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了Free3D框架，能够在没有3D运动标注的情况下合成逼真的3D运动，通过Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE将2D运动序列映射到3D一致隐空间，并使用3D无监督正则化目标实现视图一致性和物理合理性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D人体运动生成模型虽然重建精度高，但难以泛化到训练分布之外，这是因为精确的3D监督使模型学习固定坐标模式而非必要的3D结构理解和运动语义线索。

Method: 提出Free3D框架：包括将2D运动序列映射到3D一致隐空间的ML-RQ VAE，以及强制执行视图一致性、方向一致性和物理合理性的3D无监督正则化目标，完全在2D运动数据上训练。

Result: Free3D生成的3D运动多样化、时间一致且语义对齐，性能达到甚至超过完全3D监督的对应模型，表明放宽显式3D监督能促进更强的结构推理和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Free3D提供了一种可扩展且数据高效的3D运动生成范式，证实放松显式3D监督有利于模型学习更强大的结构推理能力。

Abstract: Recent 3D human motion generation models demonstrate remarkable reconstruction accuracy yet struggle to generalize beyond training distributions. This limitation arises partly from the use of precise 3D supervision, which encourages models to fit fixed coordinate patterns instead of learning the essential 3D structure and motion semantic cues required for robust generalization.To overcome this limitation, we propose Free3D, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D motions without any 3D motion annotations. Free3D introduces a Motion-Lifting Residual Quantized VAE (ML-RQ) that maps 2D motion sequences into 3D-consistent latent spaces, and a suite of 3D-free regularization objectives enforcing view consistency, orientation coherence, and physical plausibility. Trained entirely on 2D motion data, Free3D generates diverse, temporally coherent, and semantically aligned 3D motions, achieving performance comparable to or even surpassing fully 3D-supervised counterparts. These results suggest that relaxing explicit 3D supervision encourages stronger structural reasoning and generalization, offering a scalable and data-efficient paradigm for 3D motion generation.

Abstract: Extracting digital material representations from images is a necessary prerequisite for a quantitative analysis of material properties. Different segmentation approaches have been extensively studied in the past to achieve this task, but were often lacking accuracy or speed. With the advent of machine learning, supervised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for different segmentation tasks. However, these models are often trained in a supervised manner, which requires large labeled datasets. Unsupervised approaches do not require ground-truth data for learning, but suffer from long segmentation times and often worse segmentation accuracy. Hidden Markov Random Fields (HMRF) are an unsupervised segmentation approach that incorporates concepts of neighborhood and class distributions. We present a method that integrates HMRF theory and CNN segmentation, leveraging the advantages of both areas: unsupervised learning and fast segmentation times. We investigate the contribution of different neighborhood terms and components for the unsupervised HMRF loss. We demonstrate that the HMRF-UNet enables high segmentation accuracy without ground truth on a Micro-Computed Tomography ($μ$CT) image dataset of Polyurethane (PU) foam structures. Finally, we propose and demonstrate a pre-training strategy that considerably reduces the required amount of ground-truth data when training a segmentation model.

TL;DR: 论文提出了基于低秩稀疏原理的情感理解框架（LSEF），通过分层分解情感基线和瞬态波动来解决视频情感计算中的模型不稳定性和表示退化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决视频情感计算中因复杂情感动态导致的模型不稳定和表示退化问题，关键挑战在于缺乏分层结构机制来分离不同的情感组分。

Method: LSEF框架包含三个模块：稳定性编码模块（SEM）捕获低秩情感基线，动态解耦模块（DDM）分离稀疏瞬态信号，一致性集成模块（CIM）重建多尺度稳定性与反应性一致性。采用秩感知优化（RAO）策略平衡梯度平滑性和敏感性。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验证实，LSEF显著增强了鲁棒性和动态判别能力。

Conclusion: 分层低秩稀疏建模能够有效解决情感动态理解问题，验证了该框架的有效性和通用性。

Abstract: Video-based Affective Computing (VAC), vital for emotion analysis and human-computer interaction, suffers from model instability and representational degradation due to complex emotional dynamics. Since the meaning of different emotional fluctuations may differ under different emotional contexts, the core limitation is the lack of a hierarchical structural mechanism to disentangle distinct affective components, i.e., emotional bases (the long-term emotional tone), and transient fluctuations (the short-term emotional fluctuations). To address this, we propose the Low-Rank Sparse Emotion Understanding Framework (LSEF), a unified model grounded in the Low-Rank Sparse Principle, which theoretically reframes affective dynamics as a hierarchical low-rank sparse compositional process. LSEF employs three plug-and-play modules, i.e., the Stability Encoding Module (SEM) captures low-rank emotional bases; the Dynamic Decoupling Module (DDM) isolates sparse transient signals; and the Consistency Integration Module (CIM) reconstructs multi-scale stability and reactivity coherence. This framework is optimized by a Rank Aware Optimization (RAO) strategy that adaptively balances gradient smoothness and sensitivity. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets confirm that LSEF significantly enhances robustness and dynamic discrimination, which further validates the effectiveness and generality of hierarchical low-rank sparse modeling for understanding affective dynamics.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models are increasingly applied to biomedical imaging, yet scientific reasoning for microscopy remains limited by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality training data. We introduce MicroVQA++, a three-stage, large-scale and high-quality microscopy VQA corpus derived from the BIOMEDICA archive. Stage one bootstraps supervision from expert-validated figure-caption pairs sourced from peer-reviewed articles. Stage two applies HiCQA-Graph, a novel heterogeneous graph over images, captions, and QAs that fuses NLI-based textual entailment, CLIP-based vision-language alignment, and agent signals to identify and filter inconsistent samples. Stage three uses a MultiModal Large Language Model (MLLM) agent to generate multiple-choice questions (MCQ) followed by human screening. The resulting release comprises a large training split and a human-checked test split whose Bloom's level hard-sample distribution exceeds the MicroVQA benchmark. Our work delivers (i) a quality-controlled dataset that couples expert literature with graph-based filtering and human refinement; (ii) HiCQA-Graph, the first graph that jointly models (image, caption, QA) for cross-modal consistency filtering; (iii) evidence that careful data construction enables 4B-scale MLLMs to reach competitive microscopy reasoning performance (e.g., GPT-5) and achieve state-of-the-art performance among open-source MLLMs. Code and dataset will be released after the review process concludes.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has expanded their capabilities beyond high-level vision tasks. Nevertheless, their potential for Document Image Quality Assessment (DIQA) remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose Q-Doc, a three-tiered evaluation framework for systematically probing DIQA capabilities of MLLMs at coarse, middle, and fine granularity levels. a) At the coarse level, we instruct MLLMs to assign quality scores to document images and analyze their correlation with Quality Annotations. b) At the middle level, we design distortion-type identification tasks, including single-choice and multi-choice tests for multi-distortion scenarios. c) At the fine level, we introduce distortion-severity assessment where MLLMs classify distortion intensity against human-annotated references. Our evaluation demonstrates that while MLLMs possess nascent DIQA abilities, they exhibit critical limitations: inconsistent scoring, distortion misidentification, and severity misjudgment. Significantly, we show that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting substantially enhances performance across all levels. Our work provides a benchmark for DIQA capabilities in MLLMs, revealing pronounced deficiencies in their quality perception and promising pathways for enhancement.

Conclusion: 引入非对称对齐的新视角：教师必须缩减和适应来弥合视觉-脑电差距，这种教学范式为解决跨模态对齐中的根本不对称性问题提供了有效途径

Abstract: Decoding visual features from EEG signals is a central challenge in neuroscience, with cross-modal alignment as the dominant approach. We argue that the relationship between visual and brain modalities is fundamentally asymmetric, characterized by two critical gaps: a Fidelity Gap (stemming from EEG's inherent noise and signal degradation, vs. vision's high-fidelity features) and a Semantic Gap (arising from EEG's shallow conceptual representation, vs. vision's rich semantic depth). Previous methods often overlook this asymmetry, forcing alignment between the two modalities as if they were equal partners and thereby leading to poor generalization. To address this, we propose the adaptive teaching paradigm. This paradigm empowers the ``teacher" modality (vision) to dynamically shrink and adjust its knowledge structure under task guidance, tailoring its semantically dense features to match the ``student" modality (EEG)'s capacity. We implement this paradigm with the ShrinkAdapter, a simple yet effective module featuring a residual-free design and a bottleneck structure. Through extensive experiments, we validate the underlying rationale and effectiveness of our paradigm. Our method achieves a top-1 accuracy of 60.2\% on the zero-shot brain-to-image retrieval task, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods by a margin of 9.8\%. Our work introduces a new perspective for asymmetric alignment: the teacher must shrink and adapt to bridge the vision-brain gap.

Conclusion: WEAVE为研究多模态领域中的上下文交织理解和生成提供了重要基础和视角。

Abstract: Recent advances in unified multimodal models (UMMs) have enabled impressive progress in visual comprehension and generation. However, existing datasets and benchmarks focus primarily on single-turn interactions, failing to capture the multi-turn, context-dependent nature of real-world image creation and editing. To address this gap, we present WEAVE, the first suite for in-context interleaved cross-modality comprehension and generation. Our suite consists of two complementary parts. WEAVE-100k is a large-scale dataset of 100K interleaved samples spanning over 370K dialogue turns and 500K images, covering comprehension, editing, and generation tasks that require reasoning over historical context. WEAVEBench is a human-annotated benchmark with 100 tasks based on 480 images, featuring a hybrid VLM judger evaluation framework based on both the reference image and the combination of the original image with editing instructions that assesses models' abilities in multi-turn generation, visual memory, and world-knowledge reasoning across diverse domains. Experiments demonstrate that training on WEAVE-100k enables vision comprehension, image editing, and comprehension-generation collaboration capabilities. Furthermore, it facilitates UMMs to develop emergent visual-memory capabilities, while extensive evaluations on WEAVEBench expose the persistent limitations and challenges of current approaches in multi-turn, context-aware image generation and editing. We believe WEAVE provides a view and foundation for studying in-context interleaved comprehension and generation for multi-modal community.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散的脑解码器直接使用fMRI特征而忽略了视觉信息在皮层中的层次化组织，这模糊了早期、中期和晚期视觉区域的功能分工。

Method: 提出Hi-DREAM框架，使用ROI适配器将fMRI信号分组为早期/中期/晚期流，构建与U-Net深度对齐的多尺度皮层金字塔，并通过深度匹配的ControlNet在去噪过程中注入尺度特定的提示。

Result: 在Natural Scenes Dataset上的实验表明，Hi-DREAM在高层次语义指标上达到了最先进性能，同时保持了竞争力的低层次保真度。

Conclusion: 按皮层层次结构组织条件是一种强大且可解释的替代方案，不仅提升了图像重建质量，还为研究视觉皮层功能提供了有用工具。

Abstract: Mapping human brain activity to natural images offers a new window into vision and cognition, yet current diffusion-based decoders face a core difficulty: most condition directly on fMRI features without analyzing how visual information is organized across the cortex. This overlooks the brain's hierarchical processing and blurs the roles of early, middle, and late visual areas. We propose Hi-DREAM, a brain-inspired conditional diffusion framework that makes the cortical organization explicit. A region-of-interest (ROI) adapter groups fMRI into early/mid/late streams and converts them into a multi-scale cortical pyramid aligned with the U-Net depth (shallow scales preserve layout and edges; deeper scales emphasize objects and semantics). A lightweight, depth-matched ControlNet injects these scale-specific hints during denoising. The result is an efficient and interpretable decoder in which each signal plays a brain-like role, allowing the model not only to reconstruct images but also to illuminate functional contributions of different visual areas. Experiments on the Natural Scenes Dataset (NSD) show that Hi-DREAM attains state-of-the-art performance on high-level semantic metrics while maintaining competitive low-level fidelity. These findings suggest that structuring conditioning by cortical hierarchy is a powerful alternative to purely data-driven embeddings and provides a useful lens for studying the visual cortex.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled a wide range of advanced vision-language applications, including fine-grained object recognition and contextual understanding. When querying specific regions or objects in an image, human users naturally use "visual prompts" (VPs), such as bounding boxes, to provide reference. However, no existing benchmark systematically evaluates the ability of MLLMs to interpret such VPs. This gap leaves it unclear whether current MLLMs can effectively recognize VPs, an intuitive prompting method for humans, and use them to solve problems. To address this limitation, we introduce VP-Bench, a benchmark for assessing MLLMs' capability in VP perception and utilization. VP-Bench employs a two-stage evaluation framework: Stage 1 examines models' ability to perceive VPs in natural scenes, using 30k visualized prompts spanning eight shapes and 355 attribute combinations. Stage 2 investigates the impact of VPs on downstream tasks, measuring their effectiveness in real-world problem-solving scenarios. Using VP-Bench, we evaluate 28 MLLMs, including proprietary systems (e.g., GPT-4o) and open-source models (e.g., InternVL3 and Qwen2.5-VL), and provide a comprehensive analysis of factors that affect VP understanding, such as variations in VP attributes, question arrangement, and model scale. VP-Bench establishes a new reference framework for studying how MLLMs comprehend and resolve grounded referring questions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实世界数据通常存在偏见、错误和分布不均衡问题，导致模型过拟合和性能不平衡。现有合成数据方法缺乏对分布偏见和标注质量的控制。

Method: 重新设计微调过程：1）控制数据和标注生成，确保无偏见、分布平衡且无标注错误；2）全面采样物体属性（颜色、形状、大小、位置）自动构建数据集；3）使用该数据集微调VLMs并评估在绝对位置任务上向真实数据的可迁移性。

Conclusion: 使用全面控制生成的高质量合成数据可以有效替代真实数据进行视觉语言模型微调，不仅能消除数据偏见和分布不均衡问题，还能提升模型在真实世界场景中的泛化能力。

Abstract: Fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs) is a common strategy to improve performance following an ad-hoc data collection and annotation of real-world scenes. However, this process is often prone to biases, errors, and distribution imbalance, resulting in overfitting and imbalanced performance. Although a few studies have tried to address this problem by generating synthetic data, they lacked control over distribution bias and annotation quality. To address these challenges, we redesign the fine-tuning process in two ways. First, we control the generation of data and its annotations, ensuring it is free from bias, distribution imbalance, and annotation errors. We automatically construct the dataset by comprehensively sampling objects' attributes, including color, shape, size, and position within the scene. Secondly, using this annotated dataset, we fine-tune state-of-the-art VLMs and assess performance transferability to real-world data on the absolute position task. We conduct exhaustive evaluations on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) fine-tuning on balanced synthetic data yields uniform performance across the visual scene and mitigates common biases; and 2) fine-tuning on synthetic stimuli significantly improves performance on real-world data (COCO), outperforming models fine-tuned in the matched setting.

Conclusion: MaMOL是一种通用且高效的解决方案，适用于不完整多模态学习，能够有效处理遥感场景中的模态缺失问题。

Abstract: Multimodal classification in remote sensing often suffers from missing modalities caused by environmental interference, sensor failures, or atmospheric effects, which severely degrade classification performance. Existing two-stage adaptation methods are computationally expensive and assume complete multimodal data during training, limiting their generalization to real-world incompleteness. To overcome these issues, we propose a Missing-aware Mixture-of-Loras (MaMOL) framework that reformulates modality missing as a multi-task learning problem. MaMOL introduces a dual-routing mechanism: a task-oriented dynamic router that adaptively activates experts for different missing patterns, and a modality-specific-shared static router that maintains stable cross-modal knowledge sharing. Unlike prior methods that train separate networks for each missing configuration, MaMOL achieves parameter-efficient adaptation via lightweight expert updates and shared expert reuse. Experiments on multiple remote sensing benchmarks demonstrate superior robustness and generalization under varying missing rates, with minimal computational overhead. Moreover, transfer experiments on natural image datasets validate its scalability and cross-domain applicability, highlighting MaMOL as a general and efficient solution for incomplete multimodal learning.

Abstract: Accurate assessment of PD-L1 expression is critical for guiding immunotherapy, yet current immunohistochemistry (IHC) based methods are resource-intensive. We present nnUNet-B: a Bayesian segmentation framework that infers PD-L1 expression directly from H&E-stained histology images using Multimodal Posterior Sampling (MPS). Built upon nnUNet-v2, our method samples diverse model checkpoints during cyclic training to approximate the posterior, enabling both accurate segmentation and epistemic uncertainty estimation via entropy and standard deviation. Evaluated on a dataset of lung squamous cell carcinoma, our approach achieves competitive performance against established baselines with mean Dice Score and mean IoU of 0.805 and 0.709, respectively, while providing pixel-wise uncertainty maps. Uncertainty estimates show strong correlation with segmentation error, though calibration remains imperfect. These results suggest that uncertainty-aware H&E-based PD-L1 prediction is a promising step toward scalable, interpretable biomarker assessment in clinical workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BRIDGE提出了一种轻量级的视觉语言模型融合模块，通过在编码器顶部添加双向交叉注意力层来对齐视觉和文本隐藏状态，同时在检索、VQA和视觉推理任务上表现优于同类方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么在编码器早期融合token/特征，要么在后期比较池化嵌入，而两种模态的隐藏状态已经包含丰富的信息结构（视觉空间布局和文本语法语义），直接对齐这些状态是匹配两种模态

Method: 在编码器顶部放置少量仅交叉双向注意力层，将视觉和文本隐藏状态序列投影到共享空间，跨模态关注，并发送门控残差更新，使用简单稳定器改善对齐，编码器保持非因果性，生成通过可选解码器分离。

Conclusion: 提出的轻量级融合方法BRIDGE能够有效地对齐视觉和语言表示，在多项任务中表现优越，且保持了效率优势。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are a new family of models that align image content with natural language. Existing approaches typically fuse either (a) early: by mixing tokens/features inside the encoders, or (b) late: by comparing pooled embeddings. Many methods also tie fusion to an autoregressive decoder. However, the hidden states of both modalities already carry rich, modality-specific structure (spatial layout in vision; syntax and semantics in text), so directly aligning these states is a natural way to match what the two modalities "think". We propose a lightweight fusion module: a few cross-only, bidirectional attention layers placed near the top of both encoders. Each layer projects the vision and text encoder hidden-state sequences into a shared space, attends across modalities, and sends gated residual updates back, with simple stabilizers to improve alignment. The encoders remain non-causal and strong for understanding, while generation stays cleanly decoupled via an optional decoder. Across standard retrieval, VQA, and visual reasoning benchmarks, BRIDGE outperforms comparable VLMs while preserving the bi-encoder efficiency of contrastive models. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/jfeinashley/BRIDGE.

Conclusion: 提出的PML隐私框架为系统在面对知情对手时的隐私保护提供了系统解决方案，并在智能建筑分布式传感案例中验证了有效性。

Abstract: For systems whose states implicate sensitive information, their privacy is of great concern. While notions like differential privacy have been successfully introduced to dynamical systems, it is still unclear how a system's privacy can be properly protected when facing the challenging yet frequently-encountered scenario where an adversary possesses prior knowledge, e.g., the steady state, of the system. This paper presents a new systematic approach to protect the privacy of a discrete-time linear time-invariant system against adversaries knowledgeable of the system's prior information. We employ a tailored \emph{pointwise maximal leakage (PML) privacy} criterion. PML characterizes the worst-case privacy performance, which is sharply different from that of the better-known mutual-information privacy. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for PML privacy and construct tractable design procedures. Furthermore, our analysis leads to insight into how PML privacy, differential privacy, and mutual-information privacy are related. We then revisit Kalman filters from the perspective of PML privacy and derive a lower bound on the steady-state estimation-error covariance in terms of the PML parameters. Finally, the derived results are illustrated in a case study of privacy protection for distributed sensing in smart buildings.

Abstract: Electrification is contributing to substantial growth in U.S. commercial and industrial loads, but the cost and Scope 2 carbon emission implications of this load growth are opaque for both power consumers and utilities. This work describes a unique spatiotemporally resolved data set of U.S. electricity costs and emissions and applies time series approximation methods to quantify the alignment of electricity cost and emission incentives for large commercial and industrial consumers. We present a comprehensive spatiotemporal dataset of U.S. price-based demand response (i.e., tariff) and incentive-based demand response (IBDR) programs, enabling direct comparison to previously published marginal emission factor (MEF), average emission factor (AEF), and day-ahead market (DAM) prices. We resolved the structural incompatibility and fragmentation of these datasets by developing time series approximations of discrete data and unifying geospatially heterogeneous datasets. Analysis of these datasets reveals significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity in cost and carbon emissions incentives for demand-side energy flexibility, underscoring the importance of site selection as a key factor influencing power costs and scope 2 emissions. Analysis also reveals broad misalignment of economic and emissions incentives under existing electricity tariff structures, meaning tariffs are incentivizing consumption of more carbon-intensive electricity, and highlighting potential barriers to electrification delivering carbon savings.

Abstract: The design of Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) algorithms for vehicle platooning has been extensively investigated, leading to a wide range of approaches with different requirements and performance. Most existing studies evaluate these algorithms under the assumption of homogeneous platoons, i.e., when all platoon members adopt the same CACC. However, market competition is likely to result in vehicles from different manufacturers implementing distinct CACCs. This raises fundamental questions about whether heterogeneous vehicles can safely cooperate within a platoon and what performance can be achieved. To date, these questions have received little attention, as heterogeneous platoons are difficult to model and analyze. In this work, we introduce the concept of mixed platoons, i.e., platoons made of vehicles running heterogeneous CACCs, and we study their performance through simulation-based experiments. We consider mixtures of three well-established CACCs from the literature. In the first part of the paper, we study a single mixed platoon in isolation to understand the microscopic effects on safety: we evaluate the performance of various CACC-mixtures across speed change and emergency braking scenarios. In the second part, we examine a high-density ring-road scenario to assess macroscopic impacts on safety, comfort, and traffic throughput, especially comparing throughput results with those obtained from vehicles controlled by a standard Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) or by human drivers. Our findings highlight that some combinations of CACCs can operate robustly and safely, while others exhibit critical limitations in safety, comfort, or efficiency. These results emphasize the need for careful system design and the development of theoretical frameworks for modeling heterogeneous platoons.

Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the parameters of a vehicle dynamics model for predictive control in driving applications. Instead of solely using the instantaneous parameters estimated from the vehicle signals, we combine this with cameras and update a probabilistic map with parameter estimates and semantic information using Bayesian moment matching. Key to this approach is the map representation, which is constructed with conjugate priors to the measurement likelihoods and defined in the same path coordinates as the vehicle controller, such that the map can be externalized to provide a local representation of the parameter likelihoods that vary in space. The result is a spatial map of vehicle parameters adapted online to enhance the driving control system. We provide theoretical guarantees on the smoothness of relevant parameter likelihood statistics as a function of space, which is critical for their use in predictive control.

Abstract: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a well-established neurosurgical treatment aiming at symptom alleviation in a range of neurological and psychiatric diseases. Computational models of DBS are widely used to investigate the effects of stimulation on neural tissue, to explore stimulation targets and sweetspots, and ultimately, to aid clinicians in the DBS programming by calculating the stimulation parameters. Commonly, DBS is performed bilaterally, i.e. with one lead in each brain hemisphere, where computational models are solved independently for one lead at a time. This paper treats scenarios where multiple DBS leads are implanted in close proximity to one another, resulting in interacting electrical fields and, therefore, potentially overlapping stimulation spreads. In particular, a global dual-lead model is compared to approximations derived from single-lead approaches in a cohort of twelve multiple sclerosis (MS) tremor patients. It is concluded that simple superposition of volumes of tissue activated (VTAs) underestimates activation, while superposition of electric fields or activating functions leads to overestimation. It is concluded that given close proximity of DBS leads, the VTA cannot be computed individually as stimulation fields exhibit significant and complex interaction. The approach is extended to modeling two obsessive compulsive disorder patients with medially placed leads, where similar VTA discrepancies as in the MS patient cohort are observed.

Abstract: Digital Twin (DT) technologies are transforming manufacturing by enabling real-time prediction, monitoring, and control of complex processes. Yet, applying DT to deformation-based metal forming remains challenging because of the strongly coupled spatial-temporal behavior and the nonlinear relationship between toolpath and material response. For instance, sheet-metal forming by the English wheel, a highly flexible but artisan-dependent process, still lacks digital counterparts that can autonomously plan and adapt forming strategies. This study presents an adaptive DT framework that integrates Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) for physics-aware dimensionality reduction with a Koopman operator for representing nonlinear system in a linear lifted space for the real-time decision-making via model predictive control (MPC). To accommodate evolving process conditions or material states, an online Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm is introduced to update the operator coefficients in real time, enabling continuous adaptation of the DT model as new deformation data become available. The proposed framework is experimentally demonstrated on a robotic English Wheel sheet metal forming system, where deformation fields are measured and modeled under varying toolpaths. Results show that the adaptive DT is capable of controlling the forming process to achieve the given target shape by effectively capturing non-stationary process behaviors. Beyond this case study, the proposed framework establishes a generalizable approach for interpretable, adaptive, and computationally-efficient DT of nonlinear manufacturing systems, bridging reduced-order physics representations with data-driven adaptability to support autonomous process control and optimization.

Abstract: Prognostics and Health Management is crucial for the reliability and lifetime assessment of Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells (PEFCs). Here, we review the current advances on this topic, focusing mainly on key degradation mechanisms and methodologies such as physics-aware, data-driven, and hybrid modeling approaches. Key open challenges are analyzed, including the need for more accurate degradation modeling, effective management of multi-stack systems, and advancements in the currently underdeveloped action phase, in which diagnostic and prognostic insights are translated into real-time system responses, such as dynamic load derating, thermal-management adjustments, or automated maintenance triggers, to prevent failures and extend PEFC life. While notable strides have been made in recent years in diagnostics and remaining useful life estimation, it remains challenging to seamlessly integrate these insights into actionable strategies. Future directions highlight the need to address data scarcity and advance interdisciplinary research. Key focus areas include sensor integration, artificial intelligence, and digital twins. Additionally material innovations play a crucial role in bridging existing gaps. This work, therefore, intends to map the further development of Prognostics and Health Management systems toward ensuring the viability of PEFCs in practical applications.

Abstract: Differential flatness serves as a powerful tool for controlling continuous time nonlinear systems in problems such as motion planning and trajectory tracking. A similar notion, called difference flatness, exists for discrete-time systems. Although many control systems evolve in continuous time, control implementation is performed digitally, requiring discretization. It is well known in the literature that discretization does not necessarily preserve structural properties, and it has been established that, in general, flatness is not preserved under discretization (whether exact or approximate). In this paper, inspired by our previous work [1] and based on the notion of discretization maps, we construct numerical schemes that preserve flatness.

This paper introduces a high-fidelity, physics-enhanced simulator of a three-pump wastewater station that captures transient hydro-mechanical dynamics at a one-second resolution. The simulator is fully parameter-driven, adaptable to other wastewater stations, and capable of generating datasets for data-driven analytics. It can also generate balanced faulty datasets when real failures are scarce or confidential. A comparison with high-frequency SCADA data from a municipal station shows strong agreement across key operational metrics. Furthermore, the paper proposes robust statistical and mathematical frameworks for fault detection and isolation, including a nested-model F-test to detect pump degradation or system faults, and a tangent residual approach to distinguish pump faults from system faults using operating-point kinematics. This framework enables what-if studies, facilitates early fault diagnosis based on flow rate and head, and provides actionable insights for condition-based maintenance in wastewater pumping infrastructure.

Abstract: Model-based policy optimization often struggles with inaccurate system dynamics models, leading to suboptimal closed-loop performance. This challenge is especially evident in Model Predictive Control (MPC) policies, which rely on the model for real-time trajectory planning and optimization. We introduce a novel policy optimization framework for MPC-based policies combining differentiable optimization with zeroth-order optimization. Our method combines model-based and model-free gradient estimation approaches, achieving faster transient performance compared to fully data-driven approaches while maintaining convergence guarantees, even under model uncertainty. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on a nonlinear control task involving a 12-dimensional quadcopter model.

Abstract: We present an approach to compute stabilizing controllers for continuous-time linear time-invariant systems directly from an input-output trajectory affected by process and measurement noise. The proposed output-feedback design combines (i) an observer of a non-minimal realization of the plant and (ii) a feedback law obtained from a linear matrix inequality (LMI) that depends solely on the available data. Under a suitable interval excitation condition and knowledge of a noise energy bound, the feasibility of the LMI is shown to be necessary and sufficient for stabilizing all non-minimal realizations consistent with the data. We further provide a condition for the feasibility of the LMI related to the signal-to-noise ratio, guidelines to compute the noise energy bound, and numerical simulations that illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.

Conclusion: 迭代共形预测框架能有效处理与反应式非ego智能体互动时的内生分布偏移，在保证概率安全的同时提高任务完成率

Abstract: Uncertainty-aware prediction is essential for safe motion planning, especially when using learned models to forecast the behavior of surrounding agents. Conformal prediction is a statistical tool often used to produce uncertainty-aware prediction regions for machine learning models. Most existing frameworks utilizing conformal prediction-based uncertainty predictions assume that the surrounding agents are non-interactive. This is because in closed-loop, as uncertainty-aware agents change their behavior to account for prediction uncertainty, the surrounding agents respond to this change, leading to a distribution shift which we call endogenous distribution shift. To address this challenge, we introduce an iterative conformal prediction framework that systematically adapts the uncertainty-aware ego-agent controller to the endogenous distribution shift. The proposed method provides probabilistic safety guarantees while adapting to the evolving behavior of reactive, non-ego agents. We establish a model for the endogenous distribution shift and provide the conditions for the iterative conformal prediction pipeline to converge under such a distribution shift. We validate our framework in simulation for 2- and 3- agent interaction scenarios, demonstrating collision avoidance without resulting in overly conservative behavior and an overall improvement in success rates of up to 9.6% compared to other conformal prediction-based baselines.

Motivation: 为解决人工智能系统在缺乏持续对齐工作时会自发偏离原定目标的问题，作者借鉴热力学第二定律提出伦理熵概念，为AI对齐问题提供量化理论框架

Method: 定义伦理熵S = -Σ p(g_i; theta) ln p(g_i; theta)，证明其在时间上的导数dS/dt ≥ 0，并推导出对齐工作的临界稳定边界gamma_crit = (lambda_max / 2) ln N

Result: 70亿参数模型从初始熵0.32漂移到1.69 ± 1.08 nats，而采用对齐工作gamma = 20.4（1.5倍临界值）的系统保持0.00 ± 0.00 nats稳定（p = 4.19 × 10^-17）

Conclusion: 该框架将AI对齐重新定义为连续的、类似热力学的控制问题，为维护先进自主系统的稳定性和安全性提供了量化基础

Abstract: We propose that unconstrained artificial intelligence obeys a Second Law analogous to thermodynamics, where ethical entropy, defined as a measure of divergence from intended goals, increases spontaneously without continuous alignment work. For gradient-based optimizers, we define this entropy over a finite set of goals {g_i} as S = -Σ p(g_i; theta) ln p(g_i; theta), and we prove that its time derivative dS/dt >= 0, driven by exploration noise and specification gaming. We derive the critical stability boundary for alignment work as gamma_crit = (lambda_max / 2) ln N, where lambda_max is the dominant eigenvalue of the Fisher Information Matrix and N is the number of model parameters. Simulations validate this theory. A 7-billion-parameter model (N = 7 x 10^9) with lambda_max = 1.2 drifts from an initial entropy of 0.32 to 1.69 +/- 1.08 nats, while a system regularized with alignment work gamma = 20.4 (1.5 gamma_crit) maintains stability at 0.00 +/- 0.00 nats (p = 4.19 x 10^-17, n = 20 trials). This framework recasts AI alignment as a problem of continuous thermodynamic control, providing a quantitative foundation for maintaining the stability and safety of advanced autonomous systems.

Conclusion: 本工作为GUI智能体确立了新型训练范式，从孤立优化转向集成化的自我驱动协同进化方法。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) task automation constitutes a critical frontier in artificial intelligence research. While effective GUI agents synergistically integrate planning and grounding capabilities, current methodologies exhibit two fundamental limitations: (1) insufficient exploitation of cross-model synergies, and (2) over-reliance on synthetic data generation without sufficient utilization. To address these challenges, we propose Co-EPG, a self-iterative training framework for Co-Evolution of Planning and Grounding. Co-EPG establishes an iterative positive feedback loop: through this loop, the planning model explores superior strategies under grounding-based reward guidance via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), generating diverse data to optimize the grounding model. Concurrently, the optimized Grounding model provides more effective rewards for subsequent GRPO training of the planning model, fostering continuous improvement. Co-EPG thus enables iterative enhancement of agent capabilities through self-play optimization and training data distillation. On the Multimodal-Mind2Web and AndroidControl benchmarks, our framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods after just three iterations without requiring external data. The agent consistently improves with each iteration, demonstrating robust self-enhancement capabilities. This work establishes a novel training paradigm for GUI agents, shifting from isolated optimization to an integrated, self-driven co-evolution approach.

Motivation: 多目标优化问题中，帕累托最优解数量庞大，决策者难以处理，需要开发能选出代表性解子集的算法来减轻认知负荷。

Conclusion: 选择合适质量度量对所选解集特性具有决定性影响，新提出的定向覆盖度量在不同设置下表现优越。

Abstract: Many real-world decision-making problems involve optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously, rendering the selection of the most preferred solution a non-trivial problem: All Pareto optimal solutions are viable candidates, and it is typically up to a decision maker to select one for implementation based on their subjective preferences. To reduce the cognitive load on the decision maker, previous work has introduced the Pareto pruning problem, where the goal is to compute a fixed-size subset of Pareto optimal solutions that best represent the full set, as evaluated by a given quality measure. Reframing Pareto pruning as a multiwinner voting problem, we conduct an axiomatic analysis of existing quality measures, uncovering several unintuitive behaviors. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a new measure, directed coverage. We also analyze the computational complexity of optimizing various quality measures, identifying previously unknown boundaries between tractable and intractable cases depending on the number and structure of the objectives. Finally, we present an experimental evaluation, demonstrating that the choice of quality measure has a decisive impact on the characteristics of the selected set of solutions and that our proposed measure performs competitively or even favorably across a range of settings.

Conclusion: 本文的工作开启了理解团宽度编码能力的研究，为论辩问题的SAT编码提供了理论基础，展示了DDG归约的局限性。

Abstract: Structural measures of graphs, such as treewidth, are central tools in computational complexity resulting in efficient algorithms when exploiting the parameter. It is even known that modern SAT solvers work efficiently on instances of small treewidth. Since these solvers are widely applied, research interests in compact encodings into (Q)SAT for solving and to understand encoding limitations. Even more general is the graph parameter clique-width, which unlike treewidth can be small for dense graphs. Although algorithms are available for clique-width, little is known about encodings. We initiate the quest to understand encoding capabilities with clique-width by considering abstract argumentation, which is a robust framework for reasoning with conflicting arguments. It is based on directed graphs and asks for computationally challenging properties, making it a natural candidate to study computational properties. We design novel reductions from argumentation problems to (Q)SAT. Our reductions linearly preserve the clique-width, resulting in directed decomposition-guided (DDG) reductions. We establish novel results for all argumentation semantics, including counting. Notably, the overhead caused by our DDG reductions cannot be significantly improved under reasonable assumptions.

Abstract: Counterfactual decision-making in the face of uncertainty involves selecting the optimal action from several alternatives using causal reasoning. Decision-makers often rank expected potential outcomes (or their corresponding utility and desirability) to compare the preferences of candidate actions. In this paper, we study new counterfactual decision-making rules by introducing two new metrics: the probabilities of potential outcome ranking (PoR) and the probability of achieving the best potential outcome (PoB). PoR reveals the most probable ranking of potential outcomes for an individual, and PoB indicates the action most likely to yield the top-ranked outcome for an individual. We then establish identification theorems and derive bounds for these metrics, and present estimation methods. Finally, we perform numerical experiments to illustrate the finite-sample properties of the estimators and demonstrate their application to a real-world dataset.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made reasoning a central benchmark for evaluating intelligence. While prior surveys focus on efficiency by examining how to shorten reasoning chains or reduce computation, this view overlooks a fundamental challenge: current LLMs apply uniform reasoning strategies regardless of task complexity, generating long traces for trivial problems while failing to extend reasoning for difficult tasks. This survey reframes reasoning through the lens of {adaptivity}: the capability to allocate reasoning effort based on input characteristics such as difficulty and uncertainty. We make three contributions. First, we formalize deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning within the LLM context, connecting these classical cognitive paradigms with their algorithmic realizations. Second, we formalize adaptive reasoning as a control-augmented policy optimization problem balancing task performance with computational cost, distinguishing learned policies from inference-time control mechanisms. Third, we propose a systematic taxonomy organizing existing methods into training-based approaches that internalize adaptivity through reinforcement learning, supervised fine-tuning, and learned controllers, and training-free approaches that achieve adaptivity through prompt conditioning, feedback-driven halting, and modular composition. This framework clarifies how different mechanisms realize adaptive reasoning in practice and enables systematic comparison across diverse strategies. We conclude by identifying open challenges in self-evaluation, meta-reasoning, and human-aligned reasoning control.

Abstract: Knowledge graphs have emerged as fundamental structures for representing complex relational data across scientific and enterprise domains. However, existing embedding methods face critical limitations when modeling diverse relationship types at scale: Euclidean models struggle with hierarchies, vector space models cannot capture asymmetry, and hyperbolic models fail on symmetric relations. We propose HyperComplEx, a hybrid embedding framework that adaptively combines hyperbolic, complex, and Euclidean spaces via learned attention mechanisms. A relation-specific space weighting strategy dynamically selects optimal geometries for each relation type, while a multi-space consistency loss ensures coherent predictions across spaces. We evaluate HyperComplEx on computer science research knowledge graphs ranging from 1K papers (~25K triples) to 10M papers (~45M triples), demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines including TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, SEPA, and UltraE. Additional tests on standard benchmarks confirm significantly higher results than all baselines. On the 10M-paper dataset, HyperComplEx achieves 0.612 MRR, a 4.8% relative gain over the best baseline, while maintaining efficient training, achieving 85 ms inference per triple. The model scales near-linearly with graph size through adaptive dimension allocation. We release our implementation and dataset family to facilitate reproducible research in scalable knowledge graph embeddings.

Abstract: Traffic collision reconstruction traditionally relies on human expertise, often yielding inconsistent results when analyzing incomplete multimodal data. This study develops a multi-agent AI framework that reconstructs pre-crash scenarios and infers vehicle behaviors from fragmented collision data. We present a two-phase collaborative framework combining reconstruction and reasoning phases. The system processes 277 rear-end lead vehicle deceleration (LVD) collisions from the Crash Investigation Sampling System, integrating textual crash reports, structured tabular data, and visual scene diagrams. Phase I generates natural-language crash reconstructions from multimodal inputs. Phase II performs in-depth crash reasoning by combining these reconstructions with temporal Event Data Recorder (EDR).For validation, we applied it to all LVD cases, focusing on a subset of 39 complex crashes where multiple EDR records per collision introduced ambiguity (e.g., due to missing or conflicting data).The evaluation of the 39 LVD crash cases revealed our framework achieved perfect accuracy across all test cases, successfully identifying both the most relevant EDR event and correctly distinguishing striking versus struck vehicles, surpassing the 92% accuracy achieved by human researchers on the same challenging dataset. The system maintained robust performance even when processing incomplete data, including missing or erroneous EDR records and ambiguous scene diagrams. This study demonstrates superior AI capabilities in processing heterogeneous collision data, providing unprecedented precision in reconstructing impact dynamics and characterizing pre-crash behaviors.

Abstract: Understanding the interactions between biomarkers among brain regions during neurodegenerative disease is essential for unravelling the mechanisms underlying disease progression. For example, pathophysiological models of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) typically describe how variables, such as regional levels of toxic proteins, interact spatiotemporally within a dynamical system driven by an underlying biological substrate, often based on brain connectivity. However, current methods grossly oversimplify the complex relationship between brain connectivity by assuming a single-modality brain connectome as the disease-spreading substrate. This leads to inaccurate predictions of pathology spread, especially during the long-term progression period. Meanhwile, other methods of learning such a graph in a purely data-driven way face the identifiability issue due to lack of proper constraint. We thus present a novel framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) as expert guides on the interaction of regional variables to enhance learning of disease progression from irregularly sampled longitudinal patient data. By leveraging LLMs' ability to synthesize multi-modal relationships and incorporate diverse disease-driving mechanisms, our method simultaneously optimizes 1) the construction of long-term disease trajectories from individual-level observations and 2) the biologically-constrained graph structure that captures interactions among brain regions with better identifiability. We demonstrate the new approach by estimating the pathology propagation using tau-PET imaging data from an Alzheimer's disease cohort. The new framework demonstrates superior prediction accuracy and interpretability compared to traditional approaches while revealing additional disease-driving factors beyond conventional connectivity measures.

Abstract: Deployed, autonomous AI systems must often evaluate multiple plausible courses of action (extended sequences of behavior) in novel or under-specified contexts. Despite extensive training, these systems will inevitably encounter scenarios where no available course of action fully satisfies all operational constraints (e.g., operating procedures, rules, laws, norms, and goals). To achieve goals in accordance with human expectations and values, agents must go beyond their trained policies and instead construct, evaluate, and justify candidate courses of action. These processes require contextual "knowledge" that may lie outside prior (policy) training. This paper characterizes requirements for agent decision making in these contexts. It also identifies the types of knowledge agents require to make decisions robust to agent goals and aligned with human expectations. Drawing on both analysis and empirical case studies, we examine how agents need to integrate normative, pragmatic, and situational understanding to select and then to pursue more aligned courses of action in complex, real-world environments.

Abstract: The rapid expansion of e-commerce platforms generates vast amounts of unstructured product data, creating significant challenges for information retrieval, recommendation systems, and data analytics. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a structured, interpretable format to organize such data, yet constructing product-specific KGs remains a complex and manual process. This paper introduces a fully automated, AI agent-driven framework for constructing product knowledge graphs directly from unstructured product descriptions. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), our method operates in three stages using dedicated agents: ontology creation and expansion, ontology refinement, and knowledge graph population. This agent-based approach ensures semantic coherence, scalability, and high-quality output without relying on predefined schemas or handcrafted extraction rules. We evaluate the system on a real-world dataset of air conditioner product descriptions, demonstrating strong performance in both ontology generation and KG population. The framework achieves over 97\% property coverage and minimal redundancy, validating its effectiveness and practical applicability. Our work highlights the potential of LLMs to automate structured knowledge extraction in retail, providing a scalable path toward intelligent product data integration and utilization.

### [110] [Faster Symmetry Breaking Constraints for Abstract Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11029)
*Özgür Akgün,Mun See Chang,Ian P. Gent,Christopher Jefferson*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的不完全对称性破缺方法，通过更好地利用抽象结构的表示来处理建模语言中抽象变量的对称性问题，特别是针对不可区分对象产生的对称性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高层次建模语言中，抽象结构（如嵌套集合）需要转换为求解器支持的表示形式，传统的对称性破缺技术应用于抽象变量时会产生大量复杂约束，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出了一种新的不完全对称性破缺方法，通过更好地利用抽象结构的表示来处理对称性，特别针对不可区分对象产生的对称性。

Result: 该方法在对称性破缺方面比之前的方法更快，性能优于Akgün等人2025年提出的方法。

Conclusion: 新方法能够更有效地处理抽象结构的对称性问题，显著提高求解效率。

Abstract: In constraint programming and related paradigms, a modeller specifies their problem in a modelling language for a solver to search and return its solution(s). Using high-level modelling languages such as Essence, a modeller may express their problems in terms of abstract structures. These are structures not natively supported by the solvers, and so they have to be transformed into or represented as other structures before solving. For example, nested sets are abstract structures, and they can be represented as matrices in constraint solvers. Many problems contain symmetries and one very common and highly successful technique used in constraint programming is to "break" symmetries, to avoid searching for symmetric solutions. This can speed up the solving process by many orders of magnitude. Most of these symmetry-breaking techniques involve placing some kind of ordering for the variables of the problem, and picking a particular member under the symmetries, usually the smallest. Unfortunately, applying this technique to abstract variables produces a very large number of complex constraints that perform poorly in practice. In this paper, we demonstrate a new incomplete method of breaking the symmetries of abstract structures by better exploiting their representations. We apply the method in breaking the symmetries arising from indistinguishable objects, a commonly occurring type of symmetry, and show that our method is faster than the previous methods proposed in (Akgün et al. 2025).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究发现多智能体辩论中角色分配策略对推理性能有重要影响，提出了'Truth Last'策略可提升22%性能，并为解决未知真实答案问题提出了MADC策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体辩论的扩展潜力已被认可，但角色分配策略这一关键方面研究不足，需要系统探索其在推理任务中的作用。

Method: 提出了'Truth Last'角色分配策略和Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC)策略，通过路径一致性评估独立角色间的一致性，模拟最高一致性得分的角色作为真实答案。

Result: 在9个大型语言模型（包括DeepSeek-R1 Distilled Models）的挑战性推理任务上验证，MADC始终表现出先进性能，有效克服了MAD的性能瓶颈。

Conclusion: MADC为LLM智能体扩展提供了重要改进路径，能够系统优化多智能体辩论的核心机制。

Abstract: Recent studies on LLM agent scaling have highlighted the potential of Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) to enhance reasoning abilities. However, the critical aspect of role allocation strategies remains underexplored. In this study, we demonstrate that allocating roles with differing viewpoints to specific positions significantly impacts MAD's performance in reasoning tasks. Specifically, we find a novel role allocation strategy, "Truth Last", which can improve MAD performance by up to 22% in reasoning tasks. To address the issue of unknown truth in practical applications, we propose the Multi-Agent Debate Consistency (MADC) strategy, which systematically simulates and optimizes its core mechanisms. MADC incorporates path consistency to assess agreement among independent roles, simulating the role with the highest consistency score as the truth. We validated MADC across a range of LLMs (9 models), including the DeepSeek-R1 Distilled Models, on challenging reasoning tasks. MADC consistently demonstrated advanced performance, effectively overcoming MAD's performance bottlenecks and providing a crucial pathway for further improvements in LLM agent scaling.

TL;DR: DSS框架结合可微分仿真和随机搜索，改进自动驾驶规划性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶中，规划对于在复杂密集交通场景中安全导航至关重要。传统方法在策略、状态预测器和价值函数都需学习时面临挑战。

Method: 提出DSS框架，利用可微分仿真器Waymax作为状态预测器和价值函数，通过梯度下降优化动作序列规划

Result: 实验显示DSS显著提升了跟踪和路径规划精度，优于序列预测、模仿学习、无模型强化学习等方法

Conclusion: 规划梯度和随机搜索的结合为自动驾驶规划提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Planning allows an agent to safely refine its actions before executing them in the real world. In autonomous driving, this is crucial to avoid collisions and navigate in complex, dense traffic scenarios. One way to plan is to search for the best action sequence. However, this is challenging when all necessary components - policy, next-state predictor, and critic - have to be learned. Here we propose Differentiable Simulation for Search (DSS), a framework that leverages the differentiable simulator Waymax as both a next state predictor and a critic. It relies on the simulator's hardcoded dynamics, making state predictions highly accurate, while utilizing the simulator's differentiability to effectively search across action sequences. Our DSS agent optimizes its actions using gradient descent over imagined future trajectories. We show experimentally that DSS - the combination of planning gradients and stochastic search - significantly improves tracking and path planning accuracy compared to sequence prediction, imitation learning, model-free RL, and other planning methods.

Conclusion: ARCTraj为研究类人推理提供了结构化且可解释的基础，推动了可解释性、对齐和通用智能的发展。

Abstract: We present ARCTraj, a dataset and methodological framework for modeling human reasoning through complex visual tasks in the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC). While ARC has inspired extensive research on abstract reasoning, most existing approaches rely on static input--output supervision, which limits insight into how reasoning unfolds over time. ARCTraj addresses this gap by recording temporally ordered, object-level actions that capture how humans iteratively transform inputs into outputs, revealing intermediate reasoning steps that conventional datasets overlook. Collected via the O2ARC web interface, it contains around 10,000 trajectories annotated with task identifiers, timestamps, and success labels across 400 training tasks from the ARC-AGI-1 benchmark. It further defines a unified reasoning pipeline encompassing data collection, action abstraction, Markov decision process (MDP) formulation, and downstream learning, enabling integration with reinforcement learning, generative modeling, and sequence modeling methods such as PPO, World Models, GFlowNets, Diffusion agents, and Decision Transformers. Analyses of spatial selection, color attribution, and strategic convergence highlight the structure and diversity of human reasoning. Together, these contributions position ARCTraj as a structured and interpretable foundation for studying human-like reasoning, advancing explainability, alignment, and generalizable intelligence.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够学习有效的广义规划和搜索状态空间剪枝公理，在经典和数值规划领域表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Generalised planning (GP) refers to the task of synthesising programs that solve families of related planning problems. We introduce a novel, yet simple method for GP: given a set of training problems, for each problem, compute an optimal plan for each goal atom in some order, perform goal regression on the resulting plans, and lift the corresponding outputs to obtain a set of first-order $\textit{Condition} \rightarrow \textit{Actions}$ rules. The rules collectively constitute a generalised plan that can be executed as is or alternatively be used to prune the planning search space. We formalise and prove the conditions under which our method is guaranteed to learn valid generalised plans and state space pruning axioms for search. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art (generalised) planners with respect to the 3 metrics of synthesis cost, planning coverage, and solution quality on various classical and numeric planning domains.

Conclusion: 几何构造是评估多模态模型生成推理能力的理想测试平台，GGBench填补了现有评估空白，推动了更智能系统的发展。

Abstract: The advent of Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) signals a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, moving from passive perception to active, cross-modal generation. Despite their unprecedented ability to synthesize information, a critical gap persists in evaluation: existing benchmarks primarily assess discriminative understanding or unconstrained image generation separately, failing to measure the integrated cognitive process of generative reasoning. To bridge this gap, we propose that geometric construction provides an ideal testbed as it inherently demands a fusion of language comprehension and precise visual generation. We introduce GGBench, a benchmark designed specifically to evaluate geometric generative reasoning. It provides a comprehensive framework for systematically diagnosing a model's ability to not only understand and reason but to actively construct a solution, thereby setting a more rigorous standard for the next generation of intelligent systems.

Method: 采用受社交推理游戏启发的MUG协议，通过修改参考图像引入反事实证据，观察智能体是否能准确识别变化，从而检测出幻觉智能体

Conclusion: MUG为大型语言模型的多模态推理提供了一个更可靠和有效的框架，通过反事实测试和主动推理机制提升了推理准确性

Abstract: Hallucination continues to pose a major obstacle in the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Although the Multi-Agent Debate (MAD) paradigm offers a promising solution by promoting consensus among multiple agents to enhance reliability, it relies on the unrealistic assumption that all debaters are rational and reflective, which is a condition that may not hold when agents themselves are prone to hallucinations. To address this gap, we introduce the Multi-agent Undercover Gaming (MUG) protocol, inspired by social deduction games like "Who is Undercover?". MUG reframes MAD as a process of detecting "undercover" agents (those suffering from hallucinations) by employing multimodal counterfactual tests. Specifically, we modify reference images to introduce counterfactual evidence and observe whether agents can accurately identify these changes, providing ground-truth for identifying hallucinating agents and enabling robust, crowd-powered multimodal reasoning. MUG advances MAD protocols along three key dimensions: (1) enabling factual verification beyond statistical consensus through counterfactual testing; (2) introducing cross-evidence reasoning via dynamically modified evidence sources instead of relying on static inputs; and (3) fostering active reasoning, where agents engage in probing discussions rather than passively answering questions. Collectively, these innovations offer a more reliable and effective framework for multimodal reasoning in LLMs. The source code can be accessed at https://github.com/YongLD/MUG.git.

Method: STaR框架为LLMs配备慢思考能力，通过显式建模逐步思考和不确定性感知推理。训练阶段采用两阶段难度感知强化学习，从简单到复杂渐进学习；推理阶段通过整合token级置信度和答案一致性进行轨迹级不确定性量化。

Conclusion: STaR作为一种可靠且受认知启发的解决方案，在表格推理领域具有显著潜力，通过慢思考机制有效提升了LLMs在结构化数据分析中的可靠性和性能。

Abstract: Table reasoning with the large language models (LLMs) is a fundamental path toward building intelligent systems that can understand and analyze over structured data. While recent progress has shown promising results, they still suffer from two key limitations: (i) the reasoning processes lack the depth and iterative refinement characteristic of human cognition; and (ii) the reasoning processes exhibit instability, which compromises their reliability in downstream applications. In this work, we present STaR (slow-thinking for table reasoning), a new framework achieving cognitive table reasoning, in which LLMs are equipped with slow-thinking capabilities by explicitly modeling step-by-step thinking and uncertainty-aware inference. During training, STaR employs two-stage difficulty-aware reinforcement learning (DRL), progressively learning from simple to complex queries under a composite reward. During inference, STaR performs trajectory-level uncertainty quantification by integrating token-level confidence and answer consistency, enabling selection of more credible reasoning paths. Extensive experiments on benchmarks demonstrate that STaR achieves superior performance and enhanced reasoning stability. Moreover, strong generalization over out-of-domain datasets further demonstrates STaR's potential as a reliable and cognitively inspired solution for table reasoning with LLMs.

Conclusion: 该工作流程为解决AI决策责任归属问题提供了实用且有效的解决方案，能够生成在法律程序中站得住脚的决策过程文档。

Abstract: An ever increasing number of high-stake decisions are made or assisted by automated systems employing brittle artificial intelligence technology. There is a substantial risk that some of these decision induce harm to people, by infringing their well-being or their fundamental human rights. The state-of-the-art in AI systems makes little effort with respect to appropriate documentation of the decision process. This obstructs the ability to trace what went into a decision, which in turn is a prerequisite to any attempt of reconstructing a responsibility chain. Specifically, such traceability is linked to a documentation that will stand up in court when determining the cause of some AI-based decision that inadvertently or intentionally violates the law.
  This paper takes a radical, yet practical, approach to this problem, by enforcing the documentation of each and every component that goes into the training or inference of an automated decision. As such, it presents the first running workflow supporting the generation of tamper-proof, verifiable and exhaustive traces of AI decisions. In doing so, we expand the DBOM concept into an effective running workflow leveraging confidential computing technology. We demonstrate the inner workings of the workflow in the development of an app to tell poisonous and edible mushrooms apart, meant as a playful example of high-stake decision support.

Motivation: 现有的解释方法主要分别处理肯定蕴含和缺失蕴含问题，缺乏同时考虑两者的对比视角。为了更全面地理解知识库中的推理结果，需要发展能够同时解释为什么某个实例属于某个概念而另一个实例不属于该概念的方法。

Abstract: We introduce the notion of contrastive ABox explanations to answer questions of the type "Why is a an instance of C, but b is not?". While there are various approaches for explaining positive entailments (why is C(a) entailed by the knowledge base) as well as missing entailments (why is C(b) not entailed) in isolation, contrastive explanations consider both at the same time, which allows them to focus on the relevant commonalities and differences between a and b. We develop an appropriate notion of contrastive explanations for the special case of ABox reasoning with description logic ontologies, and analyze the computational complexity for different variants under different optimality criteria, considering lightweight as well as more expressive description logics. We implemented a first method for computing one variant of contrastive explanations, and evaluated it on generated problems for realistic knowledge bases.

Conclusion: 该工作提供了一个可扩展的、以人为中心的方法论，有效整合了认知科学和机器学习，用于现实世界中的社交导航。

Abstract: Navigating human-populated environments without causing discomfort is a critical capability for socially-aware agents. While rule-based approaches offer interpretability through predefined psychological principles, they often lack generalizability and flexibility. Conversely, data-driven methods can learn complex behaviors from large-scale datasets, but are typically inefficient, opaque, and difficult to align with human intuitions. To bridge this gap, we propose RLSLM, a hybrid Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates a rule-based Social Locomotion Model, grounded in empirical behavioral experiments, into the reward function of a reinforcement learning framework. The social locomotion model generates an orientation-sensitive social comfort field that quantifies human comfort across space, enabling socially aligned navigation policies with minimal training. RLSLM then jointly optimizes mechanical energy and social comfort, allowing agents to avoid intrusions into personal or group space. A human-agent interaction experiment using an immersive VR-based setup demonstrates that RLSLM outperforms state-of-the-art rule-based models in user experience. Ablation and sensitivity analyses further show the model's significantly improved interpretability over conventional data-driven methods. This work presents a scalable, human-centered methodology that effectively integrates cognitive science and machine learning for real-world social navigation.

Result: 综述发现需要将通信、学习和鲁棒性协同设计，以弥合理论MARL模型与实际实现之间的差距。

Conclusion: 未来研究方向需要开发统一的协同设计方法来解决低延迟可靠性、带宽密集型数据共享和通信隐私权衡等关键挑战。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made significant strides in enabling coordinated behaviors among autonomous agents. However, most existing approaches assume that communication is instantaneous, reliable, and has unlimited bandwidth; these conditions are rarely met in real-world deployments. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in robust and efficient communication strategies for MARL under realistic constraints, including message perturbations, transmission delays, and limited bandwidth. Furthermore, because the challenges of low-latency reliability, bandwidth-intensive data sharing, and communication-privacy trade-offs are central to practical MARL systems, we focus on three applications involving cooperative autonomous driving, distributed simultaneous localization and mapping, and federated learning. Finally, we identify key open challenges and future research directions, advocating a unified approach that co-designs communication, learning, and robustness to bridge the gap between theoretical MARL models and practical implementations.

Conclusion: 多模态医疗记录集成有潜力增强临床决策制定并改善患者预后。

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are designed to synthesize diverse data types, including unstructured clinical notes, structured lab tests, and time-series visit data. Physicians draw on these multimodal and temporal sources of EHR data to form a comprehensive view of a patient's health, which is crucial for informed therapeutic decision-making. Yet, most predictive models fail to fully capture the interactions, redundancies, and temporal patterns across multiple data modalities, often focusing on a single data type or overlooking these complexities. In this paper, we present CURENet, a multimodal model (Combining Unified Representations for Efficient chronic disease prediction) that integrates unstructured clinical notes, lab tests, and patients' time-series data by utilizing large language models (LLMs) for clinical text processing and textual lab tests, as well as transformer encoders for longitudinal sequential visits. CURENet has been capable of capturing the intricate interaction between different forms of clinical data and creating a more reliable predictive model for chronic illnesses. We evaluated CURENet using the public MIMIC-III and private FEMH datasets, where it achieved over 94\% accuracy in predicting the top 10 chronic conditions in a multi-label framework. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal EHR integration to enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes.

Conclusion: EGuR展示了动态策略生成在提高AI系统适应性和效率方面的潜力，能够生成针对特定问题的即用型优化策略，实现实时自适应推理。

Abstract: Enabling agentic AI systems to adapt their problem-solving approaches based on post-training interactions remains a fundamental challenge. While systems that update and maintain a memory at inference time have been proposed, existing designs only steer the system by modifying textual input to a language model or agent, which means that they cannot change sampling parameters, remove tools, modify system prompts, or switch between agentic and workflow paradigms. On the other hand, systems that adapt more flexibly require offline optimization and remain static once deployed. We present Experience-Guided Reasoner (EGuR), which generates tailored strategies -- complete computational procedures involving LLM calls, tools, sampling parameters, and control logic -- dynamically at inference time based on accumulated experience. We achieve this using an LLM-based meta-strategy -- a strategy that outputs strategies -- enabling adaptation of all strategy components (prompts, sampling parameters, tool configurations, and control logic). EGuR operates through two components: a Guide generates multiple candidate strategies conditioned on the current problem and structured memory of past experiences, while a Consolidator integrates execution feedback to improve future strategy generation. This produces complete, ready-to-run strategies optimized for each problem, which can be cached, retrieved, and executed as needed without wasting resources. Across five challenging benchmarks (AIME 2025, 3-SAT, and three Big Bench Extra Hard tasks), EGuR achieves up to 14% accuracy improvements over the strongest baselines while reducing computational costs by up to 111x, with both metrics improving as the system gains experience.

Motivation: 现有的关节镜导航系统存在两个主要问题：（1）光学追踪系统工作空间受限，干扰手术流程；（2）基于单目视觉的系统容易产生漂移、尺度模糊，且对快速运动或遮挡敏感。需要一个既不受严格工作空间限制，又能提供稳定准确导航的解决方案。

Method: 提出多相机关节镜导航系统，在关节镜上刚性安装一个外部相机。外部相机提供稳定的视觉里程计和绝对定位，而单目关节镜视频用于密集场景重建。通过结合这两种互补视图，系统解决了单目SLAM的尺度模糊和长期漂移问题，并确保鲁棒的重新定位。

Result: 系统有效补偿了校准误差，平均绝对轨迹误差为1.09毫米。重建场景的平均目标配准误差为2.16毫米，具有高视觉保真度（SSIM=0.69，PSNR=22.19）。

Conclusion: 该系统提供了一个实用且成本效益高的关节镜导航解决方案，填补了光学追踪和纯视觉系统之间的差距，为实现临床可部署的全视觉关节镜导航铺平了道路。

Abstract: Arthroscopic procedures can greatly benefit from navigation systems that enhance spatial awareness, depth perception, and field of view. However, existing optical tracking solutions impose strict workspace constraints and disrupt surgical workflow. Vision-based alternatives, though less invasive, often rely solely on the monocular arthroscope camera, making them prone to drift, scale ambiguity, and sensitivity to rapid motion or occlusion. We propose DualVision ArthroNav, a multi-camera arthroscopy navigation system that integrates an external camera rigidly mounted on the arthroscope. The external camera provides stable visual odometry and absolute localization, while the monocular arthroscope video enables dense scene reconstruction. By combining these complementary views, our system resolves the scale ambiguity and long-term drift inherent in monocular SLAM and ensures robust relocalization. Experiments demonstrate that our system effectively compensates for calibration errors, achieving an average absolute trajectory error of 1.09 mm. The reconstructed scenes reach an average target registration error of 2.16 mm, with high visual fidelity (SSIM = 0.69, PSNR = 22.19). These results indicate that our system provides a practical and cost-efficient solution for arthroscopic navigation, bridging the gap between optical tracking and purely vision-based systems, and paving the way toward clinically deployable, fully vision-based arthroscopic guidance.

Abstract: Image deblurring is vital in computer vision, aiming to recover sharp images from blurry ones caused by motion or camera shake. While deep learning approaches such as CNNs and Vision Transformers (ViTs) have advanced this field, they often struggle with complex or high-resolution blur and computational demands. We propose a new dual-domain architecture that unifies Vision Transformers with a frequency-domain FFT-ReLU module, explicitly bridging spatial attention modeling and frequency sparsity. In this structure, the ViT backbone captures local and global dependencies, while the FFT-ReLU component enforces frequency-domain sparsity to suppress blur-related artifacts and preserve fine details. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that this architecture achieves superior PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual quality compared to state-of-the-art models. Both quantitative metrics, qualitative comparisons, and human preference evaluations confirm its effectiveness, establishing a practical and generalizable paradigm for real-world image restoration.

Motivation: 建立关节软骨材料特性与定量磁共振成像生物标志物的相关性是构建生物逼真有限元模型的有效方法，但成像生物标志物如T2与材料性能如动态模量之间的主体特异性关系存在不确定性。

Method: 通过调整用于定义软骨特性的线性T2-动态模量关系的斜率和截距，评估有限元模型对这种不确定性的敏感性。

Result: 模量偏移导致计算应力应变前1%值出现明显百分比变化，而斜率调节的影响可忽略。

Abstract: Correlating articular cartilage material properties to quantitative magnetic resonance imaging biomarkers is a powerful approach to biofidelic finite element models. However, subject-specific relationships between imaging biomarkers such as T2 and material properties like dynamic modulus are uncertain. To evaluate the sensitivity of finite element models to this uncertainty, we shifted the slope and intercept of a linear T2-dynamic modulus relationship used to define cartilage properties. Modulus shifts led to notable percent changes in the top 1% of calculated stress and strain while modulating slope had a negligible impact, together supporting the use of physiologically relevant moduli ranges in subject-specific models.

Abstract: Neural Video Representation~(NVR) is a promising paradigm for video compression, showing great potential in improving video storage and transmission efficiency. While recent advances have made efforts in architectural refinements to improve representational capability, these methods typically involve complex designs, which may incur increased computational overhead and lack the flexibility to integrate into other frameworks. Moreover, the inherent limitation in model capacity restricts the expressiveness of NVR networks, resulting in a performance bottleneck. To overcome these limitations, we propose Online-RepNeRV, a NVR framework based on online structural reparameterization. Specifically, we propose a universal reparameterization block named ERB, which incorporates multiple parallel convolutional paths to enhance the model capacity. To mitigate the overhead, an online reparameterization strategy is adopted to dynamically fuse the parameters during training, and the multi-branch structure is equivalently converted into a single-branch structure after training. As a result, the additional computational and parameter complexity is confined to the encoding stage, without affecting the decoding efficiency. Extensive experiments on mainstream video datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an average PSNR gain of 0.37-2.7 dB over baseline methods, while maintaining comparable training time and decoding speed.

Method: 提出模态不变表示学习框架，在大规模预训练基础上评估卒中和癫痫病灶分割任务中的表现。

Result: 实验结果表明，尽管能成功实现跨模态对齐，但病灶分割主要受益于保留细粒度的模态特定特征。

Conclusion: 模态不变的表示学习虽然能实现跨模态对齐，但在病灶分割任务中保留模态特定细节特征更为关键。

Abstract: The field of computer vision is undergoing a paradigm shift toward large-scale foundation model pre-training via self-supervised learning (SSL). Leveraging large volumes of unlabeled brain MRI data, such models can learn anatomical priors that improve few-shot performance in diverse neuroimaging tasks. However, most SSL frameworks are tailored to natural images, and their adaptation to capture multi-modal MRI information remains underexplored. This work proposes a modality-invariant representation learning setup and evaluates its effectiveness in stroke and epilepsy lesion segmentation, following large-scale pre-training. Experimental results suggest that despite successful cross-modality alignment, lesion segmentation primarily benefits from preserving fine-grained modality-specific features. Model checkpoints and code are made publicly available.

Main category: cs.NI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个高度依赖的无人机毫米波信道模型，研究城市几何形态对LoS概率和大尺度衰落的影响，发现即使建筑参数固定，几何布局也会对路径损耗指数产生一致但适度的变化。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无人机作为空中基站可扩展6G毫米波覆盖范围，但由于空对地信道高度依赖于高度和城市几何形态，需要建立更精确的信道模型来提升链路可靠性。

Conclusion: 提出的统一模型与射线追踪统计结果高度吻合，提供了一个适用于复杂城市场景ABS规划的实用高度相关大尺度衰落模型。

Abstract: Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) serving as Aerial Base Stations (ABSs) are expected to extend 6G millimeter-Wave (mmWave) coverage and improve link reliability in urban areas. However, UAV-based Air-to-Ground (A2G) channels are highly dependent on height and urban geometry. This paper proposes an ABS height-dependent mmWave channel model and investigates whether urban geometry, beyond the standard built-up parameters, significantly affects LoS probability (PLoS) and Large-Scale Fading (LSF). Using MATLAB ray tracing at 26 GHz, we simulate approximately 10K city realizations for four urban layouts that share identical built-up parameters but differ in their spatial organization. We extract elevation-based PLoS using a sigmoid model and derive height-dependent Path-Loss Exponents (PLEs) and shadow-fading trends using exponential fits. Results show that PLE for Non-Line-of-Sight (NLoS) decreases toward 2.5-3 at high altitudes, Line-of-Sight (LoS) PLE remains near 2, and shadow fading reduces with height. We also find that geometric layout introduces a modest but consistent change in PLE (+/- 0.2), even when built-up parameters are fixed. The proposed unified model aligns well with ray-tracing statistics and offers a practical, height-dependent LSF model suitable for ABS planning in complex urban scenarios.

Abstract: We propose to enhance the dependability of large-scale IoT systems by separating the management and operation plane. We innovate the management plane to enforce overarching policies, such as safety norms, operation standards, and energy restrictions, and integrate multi-faceted management entities, including regulatory agencies and manufacturers, while the current IoT operational workflow remains unchanged. Central to the management plane is a meticulously designed, identity-independent policy framework that employs flexible descriptors rather than fixed identifiers, allowing for proactive deployment of overarching policies with adaptability to system changes. Our evaluation across three datasets indicates that the proposed framework can achieve near-optimal expressiveness and dependable policy enforcement.

Motivation: 传统的一比特压缩感知支持集恢复算法运行时间通常为Ω(n)，这在处理高维信号时效率较低。本文旨在开发具有亚线性运行时间o(n)的高效算法，显著提升计算效率。

Abstract: The problem of support recovery in one-bit compressed sensing (1bCS) aim to recover the support of a signal $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$, denoted as supp$(x)$, from the observation $y=\text{sign}(Ax)$, where $A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$ is a sensing matrix and $|\text{supp}(x)|\leq k, k \ll n$. Under this setting, most preexisting works have a recovery runtime $Ω(n)$. In this paper, we propose two schemes that have sublinear $o(n)$ runtime. (1.i): For the universal exact support recovery, a scheme of $m=O(k^2\log(n/k)\log n)$ measurements and runtime $D=O(km)$. (1.ii): For the universal $ε$-approximate support recovery, the same scheme with $m=O(kε^{-1}\log(n/k)\log n)$ and runtime $D=O(ε^{-1}m)$, improving the runtime significantly with an extra $O(\log n)$ factor in the number of measurements compared to the current optimal (Matsumoto et al., 2023). (2): For the probabilistic exact support recovery in the sublinear regime, a scheme of $m:=O(k\frac{\log k}{\log\log k}\log n)$ measurements and runtime $O(m)$, with vanishing error probability, improving the recent result of Yang et al., 2025.

Abstract: Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) has been envisioned as a promising technology to support ubiquitous connectivity and reliable sustainability in Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks, which, however, generally suffers from severe attenuation caused by long distance propagation, leading to inefficient wireless power transfer (WPT) for energy harvesting receivers (EHRs). This paper proposes to introduce emerging intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and movable antenna (MA) technologies into SWIPT systems aiming at enhancing information transmission for information decoding receivers (IDRs) and improving receive power of EHRs. We consider to maximize the weighted sum-rate of IDRs via jointly optimizing the active and passive beamforming at the base station (BS) and IRS, respectively, as well as the positions of MAs, while guaranteeing the requirements of all EHRs. To tackle this challenging task due to the non-convexity of associated optimization, we develop an efficient algorithm combining weighted minimal mean square error (WMMSE), block coordinate descent (BCD), majorization-minimization (MM), and penalty duality decomposition (PDD) frameworks. Besides, we present a feasibility characterization method to examine the achievability of EHRs' requirements. Simulation results demonstrate the significant benefits of our proposed solutions. Particularly, the optimized IRS configuration may exhibit higher performance gain than MA counterpart under our considered scenario.

Abstract: The phenomenon of mutual coupling in continuous aperture arrays (CAPAs) is studied. First, a general physical model for the phenomenon that accounts for both polarization and surface dissipation losses is developed. Then, the unipolarized coupling kernel is characterized, revealing that polarization induces anisotropic coupling and invalidates the conventional half-wavelength spacing rule for coupling elimination. Next, the beamforming design problem for CAPAs with coupling is formulated as a functional optimization problem, leading to the derivation of optimal beamforming structures via the calculus of variations. To address the challenge of inverting the coupling kernel in the optimal structure, two methods are proposed: 1) the kernel approximation method, which yields a closed-form solution via wavenumber-domain transformation and GaussLegendre quadrature, and 2) the conjugate gradient method, which addresses an equivalent quadratic functional optimization problem iteratively. Furthermore, the optimal array gain and beampattern are analyzed at the large-aperture limit. Finally, the proposed continuous mutual coupling model is extended to spatially discrete arrays (SPDAs), and comprehensive numerical results are provided, demonstrating that: 1) coupled SPDA performance correctly converges to the CAPA limit, while uncoupled models are shown to violate physics, 2) polarization results in anisotropic array gain behavior, and 3) the coupled beampattern exhibits higher directivity than the uncoupled beampattern.

Abstract: Non-binary linear block codes (NB-LBCs) are an important class of error-correcting codes that are especially competent in correcting burst errors. They have broad applications in modern communications and storage systems. However, efficient soft-decision decoding of these codes remains challenging. This paper proposes successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding for NB-LBCs that are defined over a finite field of characteristic two, i.e., F_{2^r}, where r is the extension degree. By establishing a one-to-r mapping between the binary composition of each non-binary codeword and r binary polar codewords, SCL decoding of the r polar codes can be performed with a complexity that is sub-quadratic in the codeword length. An r-step decoding path sorting strategy is further proposed to facilitate the decoding. Simulation results on extended Reed-Solomon (eRS) and non-binary extended BCH (NB-eBCH) codes show that SCL decoding can outperform their state-of-the-art soft-decision decoding with fewer finite field arithmetic operations. For length-16 eRS codes, their maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding performances can be approached with a moderate list size.

TL;DR: 该论文分析了参数高效微调方法在长尾分布下的性能限制，发现其虽然保持了尾部类表现但损害了头部类精度。论文提出了LT-Soups两阶段模型融合框架，通过平衡子集平均和分类器微调来改善头部-尾部性能平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实数据集通常呈现长尾分布，参数高效微调方法如LoRA在长尾任务中牺牲头部类准确性来保持尾部类性能，头部-尾部比例被忽视作为影响性能平衡的关键因素。

Method: 提出LT-Soups两阶段框架：第一阶段在平衡子集上平均微调模型以降低头部类偏差；第二阶段仅在全数据集上微调分类器以恢复头部类精度。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上的实验表明，LT-Soups在广泛的分布不平衡范围内实现了比传统PEFT和模型融合方法更优越的性能权衡。

Conclusion: LT-Soups框架有效解决了长尾分布下参数高效微调的局限性，通过控制模型偏差和保持头部类精度，在各种不平衡场景下都能实现更好的泛化性能。

Abstract: Real-world datasets typically exhibit long-tailed (LT) distributions, where a few head classes dominate and many tail classes are severely underrepresented. While recent work shows that parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like LoRA and AdaptFormer preserve tail-class performance on foundation models such as CLIP, we find that they do so at the cost of head-class accuracy. We identify the head-tail ratio, the proportion of head to tail classes, as a crucial but overlooked factor influencing this trade-off. Through controlled experiments on CIFAR100 with varying imbalance ratio ($ρ$) and head-tail ratio ($η$), we show that PEFT excels in tail-heavy scenarios but degrades in more balanced and head-heavy distributions. To overcome these limitations, we propose LT-Soups, a two-stage model soups framework designed to generalize across diverse LT regimes. In the first stage, LT-Soups averages models fine-tuned on balanced subsets to reduce head-class bias; in the second, it fine-tunes only the classifier on the full dataset to restore head-class accuracy. Experiments across six benchmark datasets show that LT-Soups achieves superior trade-offs compared to both PEFT and traditional model soups across a wide range of imbalance regimes.

Abstract: Data-driven discovery of governing equations from data remains a fundamental challenge in nonlinear dynamics. Although sparse regression techniques have advanced system identification, they struggle with rational functions and noise sensitivity in complex mechanical systems. The Lagrangian formalism offers a promising alternative, as it typically avoids rational expressions and provides a more concise representation of system dynamics. However, existing Lagrangian identification methods are significantly affected by measurement noise and limited data availability. This paper presents a novel differentiable sparse identification framework that addresses these limitations through three key contributions: (1) the first integration of cubic B-Spline approximation into Lagrangian system identification, enabling accurate representation of complex nonlinearities, (2) a robust equation discovery mechanism that effectively utilizes measurements while incorporating known physical constraints, (3) a recursive derivative computation scheme based on B-spline basis functions, effectively constraining higher-order derivatives and reducing noise sensitivity on second-order dynamical systems. The proposed method demonstrates superior performance and enables more accurate and reliable extraction of physical laws from noisy data, particularly in complex mechanical systems compared to baseline methods.

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient finetuning (PEFT) enhances model performance on downstream tasks by updating a minimal subset of parameters. Representation finetuning (ReFT) methods further improve efficiency by freezing model weights and optimizing internal representations with fewer parameters than PEFT, outperforming PEFT on several tasks. However, ReFT exhibits a significant performance decline on mathematical reasoning tasks. To address this problem, the paper demonstrates that ReFT's poor performance on mathematical tasks primarily stems from its struggle to generate effective reasoning prefixes during the early inference phase. Moreover, ReFT disturbs the numerical encoding and the error accumulats during the CoT stage. Based on these observations, this paper proposes Bias-REstrained Prefix Representation FineTuning (BREP ReFT), which enhances ReFT's mathematical reasoning capability by truncating training data to optimize the generation of initial reasoning prefixes, intervening on the early inference stage to prevent error accumulation, and constraining the intervention vectors' magnitude to avoid disturbing numerical encoding. Extensive experiments across diverse model architectures demonstrate BREP's superior effectiveness, efficiency, and robust generalization capability, outperforming both standard ReFT and weight-based PEFT methods on the task of mathematical reasoning.

Abstract: While generative models have become increasingly prevalent across various domains, fundamental concerns regarding their reliability persist. A crucial yet understudied aspect of these models is the uncertainty quantification surrounding their distribution approximation capabilities. Current evaluation methodologies focus predominantly on measuring the closeness between the learned and the target distributions, neglecting the inherent uncertainty in these measurements. In this position paper, we formalize the problem of uncertainty quantification in generative model learning. We discuss potential research directions, including the use of ensemble-based precision-recall curves. Our preliminary experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of aggregated precision-recall curves in capturing model approximation uncertainty, enabling systematic comparison among different model architectures based on their uncertainty characteristics.

*Jiazhou Liang,Hassan Khurram,Scott Sanner*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了两种新颖的线性预测聚类(LPC)全局优化方法，通过在可分离性理论基础上的近似优化，显著提升了传统混合整数规划方法的可扩展性，同时优于贪心优化方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LPC方法存在局限性：贪心优化方法缺乏全局最优性且在非可分离聚类中表现不佳；混合整数规划方法虽然能保证全局最优但可扩展性差。需要开发既保证性能又具备良好可扩展性的新方法。

Method: 基于约束优化范式，利用可分离性的理论特性推导出带可证明误差界的近优近似方法，显著简化MIP公式复杂度；同时将LPC近似为二次伪布尔优化问题，在某些场景下实现显著计算改进。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的比较分析表明，所提方法一致获得近优解，相比贪心优化显著降低回归误差，同时相对于现有MIP公式展示出优越的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 基于可分离性理论的近似方法成功平衡了LPC问题的全局最优性和计算效率，为实际应用提供了更可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Linear Predictive Clustering (LPC) partitions samples based on shared linear relationships between feature and target variables, with numerous applications including marketing, medicine, and education. Greedy optimization methods, commonly used for LPC, alternate between clustering and linear regression but lack global optimality. While effective for separable clusters, they struggle in non-separable settings where clusters overlap in feature space. In an alternative constrained optimization paradigm, Bertsimas and Shioda (2007) formulated LPC as a Mixed-Integer Program (MIP), ensuring global optimality regardless of separability but suffering from poor scalability. This work builds on the constrained optimization paradigm to introduce two novel approaches that improve the efficiency of global optimization for LPC. By leveraging key theoretical properties of separability, we derive near-optimal approximations with provable error bounds, significantly reducing the MIP formulation's complexity and improving scalability. Additionally, we can further approximate LPC as a Quadratic Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (QPBO) problem, achieving substantial computational improvements in some settings. Comparative analyses on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently achieve near-optimal solutions with substantially lower regression errors than greedy optimization while exhibiting superior scalability over existing MIP formulations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究了Transformer预测Collatz步骤的能力，模型精度随编码基数变化（24和32基可达99.7%，11和3基仅37-25%），学习模式相同：逐步掌握按2^p模分类的输入类别，准确率差异显著（掌握类别近乎完美，其他不足1%）


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解Transformer学习复杂算术函数（如Collatz序列）的能力，探索不同编码基数对学习效果的影响，揭示模型学习计算控制结构的机制

Method: 使用Transformer模型预测Collatz序列的长步骤，比较不同进制编码（3,11,24,32基等）对模型性能的影响，分析学习过程和错误模式

Result: 模型精度高度依赖编码基数，24和32基可达99.7%精度，而11和3基仅25-37%；所有模型都遵循相同学习模式，逐步掌握按2^p模分类的输入类别；多数错误源于对循环长度估计错误而非计算错误，幻觉现象罕见

Conclusion: 学习复杂算术函数的难点在于掌握计算的控制结构（循环长度）；本研究证明了数学问题可作为理解和改进语言模型的重要工具，该方法具有广泛适用性

Abstract: We investigate transformer prediction of long Collatz steps, a complex arithmetic function that maps odd integers to their distant successors in the Collatz sequence ( $u_{n+1}=u_n/2$ if $u_n$ is even, $u_{n+1}=(3u_n+1)/2$ if $u_n$ is odd). Model accuracy varies with the base used to encode input and output. It can be as high as $99.7\%$ for bases $24$ and $32$, and as low as $37$ and $25\%$ for bases $11$ and $3$. Yet, all models, no matter the base, follow a common learning pattern. As training proceeds, they learn a sequence of classes of inputs that share the same residual modulo $2^p$. Models achieve near-perfect accuracy on these classes, and less than $1\%$ for all other inputs. This maps to a mathematical property of Collatz sequences: the length of the loops involved in the computation of a long Collatz step can be deduced from the binary representation of its input. The learning pattern reflects the model learning to predict inputs associated with increasing loop lengths. An analysis of failure cases reveals that almost all model errors follow predictable patterns. Hallucination, a common feature of large language models, almost never happens. In over $90\%$ of failures, the model performs the correct calculation, but wrongly estimates loop lengths. Our observations give a full account of the algorithms learned by the models. They suggest that the difficulty of learning such complex arithmetic function lies in figuring the control structure of the computation -- the length of the loops. We believe that the approach outlined here, using mathematical problems as tools for understanding, explaining, and perhaps improving language models, can be applied to a broad range of problems and bear fruitful results.

Abstract: Although neural operators are widely used in data-driven physical simulations, their training remains computationally expensive. Recent advances address this issue via downstream learning, where a model pretrained on simpler problems is fine-tuned on more complex ones. In this research, we investigate transformer-based neural operators, which have previously been applied only to specific problems, in a more general transfer learning setting. We evaluate their performance across diverse PDE problems, including extrapolation to unseen parameters, incorporation of new variables, and transfer from multi-equation datasets. Our results demonstrate that advanced neural operator architectures can effectively transfer knowledge across PDE problems.

Abstract: Quantum kernel methods are a promising branch of quantum machine learning, yet their practical advantage on diverse, high-dimensional, real-world data remains unverified. Current research has largely been limited to low-dimensional or synthetic datasets, preventing a thorough evaluation of their potential. To address this gap, we developed a variational quantum kernel framework utilizing resource-efficient ansätze for complex classification tasks and introduced a parameter scaling technique to accelerate convergence. We conducted a comprehensive benchmark of this framework on eight challenging, real world and high-dimensional datasets covering tabular, image, time series, and graph data. Our classically simulated results show that the proposed quantum kernel demonstrated a clear performance advantage over standard classical kernels, such as the radial basis function (RBF) kernel. This work demonstrates that properly designed quantum kernels can function as versatile, high-performance tools, laying a foundation for quantum-enhanced applications in real-world machine learning. Further research is needed to fully assess the practical quantum advantage.

Abstract: Equation discovery from data is a core challenge in machine learning for science, requiring the recovery of concise symbolic expressions that govern complex physical and geometric phenomena. Recent approaches with large language models (LLMs) show promise in symbolic regression, but their success often hinges on memorized formulas or overly simplified functional forms. Existing benchmarks exacerbate this limitation: they focus on scalar functions, ignore domain grounding, and rely on brittle string-matching based metrics that fail to capture scientific equivalence. We introduce SurfaceBench, first comprehensive benchmark for symbolic surface discovery. SurfaceBench comprises 183 tasks across 15 categories of symbolic complexity, spanning explicit, implicit, and parametric equation representation forms. Each task includes ground-truth equations, variable semantics, and synthetically sampled three dimensional data. Unlike prior SR datasets, our tasks reflect surface-level structure, resist LLM memorization through novel symbolic compositions, and are grounded in scientific domains such as fluid dynamics, robotics, electromagnetics, and geometry. To evaluate equation discovery quality, we pair symbolic checks with geometry-aware metrics such as Chamfer and Hausdorff distances, capturing both algebraic fidelity and spatial reconstruction accuracy. Our experiments reveal that state-of-the-art frameworks, while occasionally successful on specific families, struggle to generalize across representation types and surface complexities. SurfaceBench thus establishes a challenging and diagnostic testbed that bridges symbolic reasoning with geometric reconstruction, enabling principled benchmarking of progress in compositional generalization, data-driven scientific induction, and geometry-aware reasoning with LLMs. We release the code here: https://github.com/Sanchit-404/surfacebench

TL;DR: 论文总结了EarthSight框架通过多任务推理、地面站查询调度和动态过滤器排序等技术，显著提升了卫星图像分析的效率和响应速度，降低了计算时间和端到端延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的卫星图像处理流程因通信带宽受限导致延迟较长，影响时效性应用。现有解决方案通常将每个卫星视为独立的计算节点，存在冗余推理和资源浪费的问题。

Method: 提出了EarthSight分布式运行时框架，包括多任务推理、地面站查询调度器和动态过滤器排序，以优化卫星和地面站之间的分布式决策。

Result: 评估显示，EarthSight将每张图像的平均计算时间减少了1.9倍，90%端到端延迟从51分钟降至21分钟。

Conclusion: EarthSight框架通过整合全局上下文和资源感知决策，实现了在严格带宽和功耗预算下的可扩展、低延迟卫星图像分析。

Abstract: Low-latency delivery of satellite imagery is essential for time-critical applications such as disaster response, intelligence, and infrastructure monitoring. However, traditional pipelines rely on downlinking all captured images before analysis, introducing delays of hours to days due to restricted communication bandwidth. To address these bottlenecks, emerging systems perform onboard machine learning to prioritize which images to transmit. However, these solutions typically treat each satellite as an isolated compute node, limiting scalability and efficiency. Redundant inference across satellites and tasks further strains onboard power and compute costs, constraining mission scope and responsiveness. We present EarthSight, a distributed runtime framework that redefines satellite image intelligence as a distributed decision problem between orbit and ground. EarthSight introduces three core innovations: (1) multi-task inference on satellites using shared backbones to amortize computation across multiple vision tasks; (2) a ground-station query scheduler that aggregates user requests, predicts priorities, and assigns compute budgets to incoming imagery; and (3) dynamic filter ordering, which integrates model selectivity, accuracy, and execution cost to reject low-value images early and conserve resources. EarthSight leverages global context from ground stations and resource-aware adaptive decisions in orbit to enable constellations to perform scalable, low-latency image analysis within strict downlink bandwidth and onboard power budgets. Evaluations using a prior established satellite simulator show that EarthSight reduces average compute time per image by 1.9x and lowers 90th percentile end-to-end latency from first contact to delivery from 51 to 21 minutes compared to the state-of-the-art baseline.

Motivation: 当前LLM在安全关键领域中存在幻觉问题，但现有检测方法计算成本高且未区分幻觉类型，需要开发更高效且针对性的检测策略。

Method: 使用基于注意力的不确定性量化算法，提出新颖的注意力聚合策略，构建区分外在和内在幻觉的评估框架。

Conclusion: 注意力机制是量化模型不确定性的重要信号，需要根据幻觉性质调整检测策略，为幻觉检测提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains, yet remain susceptible to hallucinations. While prior works have proposed confidence representation methods for hallucination detection, most of these approaches rely on computationally expensive sampling strategies and often disregard the distinction between hallucination types. In this work, we introduce a principled evaluation framework that differentiates between extrinsic and intrinsic hallucination categories and evaluates detection performance across a suite of curated benchmarks. In addition, we leverage a recent attention-based uncertainty quantification algorithm and propose novel attention aggregation strategies that improve both interpretability and hallucination detection performance. Our experimental findings reveal that sampling-based methods like Semantic Entropy are effective for detecting extrinsic hallucinations but generally fail on intrinsic ones. In contrast, our method, which aggregates attention over input tokens, is better suited for intrinsic hallucinations. These insights provide new directions for aligning detection strategies with the nature of hallucination and highlight attention as a rich signal for quantifying model uncertainty.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FlowPath提出了一种通过可逆神经流学习控制路径几何形状的新方法，相较于传统固定插值方法，在处理稀疏和不规则时间序列时表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经控制微分方程在处理稀疏和不规则采样时间序列时，其性能严重依赖基于离散观测构建的控制路径。固定插值方法存在简单几何假设缺陷，特别是在高缺失率情况下无法准确表示底层数据流形。

Method: FlowPath通过可逆神经流学习方法构建连续且数据自适应的流形路径，利用可逆性约束确保信息保持和良好行为变换，这与先前无约束学习路径模型形成重要区别。

Result: 在18个基准数据集和真实案例研究中，FlowPath相比使用固定插值或不可逆架构的基线方法，在分类准确率上取得了统计显著的持续改进。

Conclusion: 研究强调了不仅要建模路径上的动态变化，还要建模路径本身的几何形状的重要性，为从不规则时间序列中学习提供了鲁棒且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling continuous-time dynamics from sparse and irregularly-sampled time series remains a fundamental challenge. Neural controlled differential equations provide a principled framework for such tasks, yet their performance is highly sensitive to the choice of control path constructed from discrete observations. Existing methods commonly employ fixed interpolation schemes, which impose simplistic geometric assumptions that often misrepresent the underlying data manifold, particularly under high missingness. We propose FlowPath, a novel approach that learns the geometry of the control path via an invertible neural flow. Rather than merely connecting observations, FlowPath constructs a continuous and data-adaptive manifold, guided by invertibility constraints that enforce information-preserving and well-behaved transformations. This inductive bias distinguishes FlowPath from prior unconstrained learnable path models. Empirical evaluations on 18 benchmark datasets and a real-world case study demonstrate that FlowPath consistently achieves statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy over baselines using fixed interpolants or non-invertible architectures. These results highlight the importance of modeling not only the dynamics along the path but also the geometry of the path itself, offering a robust and generalizable solution for learning from irregular time series.

Conclusion: 论文证明了在线强化学习中使用精心设计的行为策略收集离策略数据可以提高样本效率和学习性能的重要结论。

Abstract: Many reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly those that rely on return estimates for policy improvement, can suffer from poor sample efficiency and training instability due to high-variance return estimates. In this paper we leverage new results from off-policy evaluation; it has recently been shown that well-designed behaviour policies can be used to collect off-policy data for provably lower variance return estimates. This result is surprising as it means collecting data on-policy is not variance optimal. We extend this key insight to the online reinforcement learning setting, where both policy evaluation and improvement are interleaved to learn optimal policies. Off-policy RL has been well studied (e.g., IMPALA), with correct and truncated importance weighted samples for de-biasing and managing variance appropriately. Generally these approaches are concerned with reconciling data collected from multiple workers in parallel, while the policy is updated asynchronously, mismatch between the workers and policy is corrected in a mathematically sound way. Here we consider only one worker - the behaviour policy, which is used to collect data for policy improvement, with provably lower variance return estimates. In our experiments we extend two policy-gradient methods with this regime, demonstrating better sample efficiency and performance over a diverse set of environments.

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) pretrained on data from multiple domains have shown strong performance on diverse modeling tasks. Various efforts have been made to develop foundation models specific to electroencephalography (EEG) data, which records brain electrical activity as time series. However, no comparative analysis of EEG-specific foundation models (EEGFMs) versus general TSFMs has been performed on EEG-specific tasks. We introduce a novel Spatial-Temporal Adapter with Multi-Head Pooling (STAMP), which leverages univariate embeddings produced by a general TSFM, implicitly models spatial-temporal characteristics of EEG data, and achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art EEGFMs. A comprehensive analysis is performed on 8 benchmark datasets of clinical tasks using EEG for classification, along with ablation studies. Our proposed adapter is lightweight in trainable parameters and flexible in the inputs it can accommodate, supporting easy modeling of EEG data using TSFMs.

Method: ExPairT-LLM是一种精确学习算法，通过向LLM Oracle提出两种新型查询：配对成员关系查询和配对等价查询，通过锦标赛机制选择程序，对某些LLM错误具有鲁棒性

Result: 在四个流行代码数据集上的评估显示，ExPairT-LLM的平均pass@1比最先进的代码选择算法高出13.0%，最高可达27.1%，并将执行复杂推理的LLM的pass@1提高24.0%

Conclusion: ExPairT-LLM通过使用更简单的LLM查询类型实现了更有效的代码选择，显著提升了代码生成的成功率

Abstract: Despite recent advances in LLMs, the task of code generation is still challenging. To cope, code selection algorithms select the best program from multiple programs generated by an LLM. However, existing algorithms can fail to identify the correct program, either because they can misidentify nonequivalent programs or because they rely on an LLM and assume it always correctly determines the output for every input. We present ExPairT-LLM, an exact learning algorithm for code selection that selects a program by posing to an LLM oracle two new types of queries: pairwise membership and pairwise equivalence. These queries are simpler for LLMs and enable ExPairT-LLM to identify the correct program through a tournament, which is robust to some LLM mistakes. We evaluate ExPairT-LLM on four popular code datasets. Its pass@1 (success rate) outperforms the state-of-the-art code selection algorithm on average by +13.0% and up to +27.1%. It also improves the pass@1 of LLMs performing complex reasoning by +24.0%.

Motivation: 现有的一阶差分隐私机器学习算法计算和内存成本高，而零阶方法虽然易于私有化但性能相对较低，需要更高效的解决方案

Method: 提出PAZO框架，利用公共信息指导私有零阶算法的梯度近似，提供理论分析并验证公共与私有数据相似性的假设

Conclusion: PAZO框架有效解决了差分隐私算法的性能与效率平衡问题，为部署实际差分隐私ML系统提供了有前景的方向

Abstract: One of the major bottlenecks for deploying popular first-order differentially private (DP) machine learning algorithms (e.g., DP-SGD) lies in their high computation and memory cost, despite the existence of optimized implementations. Zeroth-order methods have promise in mitigating the overhead, as they leverage function evaluations to approximate the gradients, hence significantly easier to privatize. While recent works have explored zeroth-order approaches in both private and non-private settings, they still suffer from relatively low utilities compared with DP-SGD, and have only been evaluated in limited application domains. In this work, we propose to leverage public information to guide and improve gradient approximation of private zeroth-order algorithms. We explore a suite of public-data-assisted zeroth-order optimizers (PAZO) with minimal overhead. We provide theoretical analyses of the PAZO framework under an assumption of the similarity between public and private data. Empirically, we demonstrate that PAZO achieves superior privacy/utility tradeoffs across vision and text tasks in both pre-training and fine-tuning settings, outperforming the best first-order baselines (with public data) especially in highly private regimes, while offering up to $16\times$ runtime speedup.

Abstract: In machine learning, a self-attention dynamics is a continuous-time multiagent-like model of the attention mechanisms of transformers. In this paper we show that such dynamics is related to a multiagent version of the Oja flow, a dynamical system that computes the principal eigenvector of a matrix corresponding for transformers to the value matrix. We classify the equilibria of the ``single-head'' self-attention system into four classes: consensus, bipartite consensus, clustering and polygonal equilibria. Multiple asymptotically stable equilibria from the first three classes often coexist in the self-attention dynamics. Interestingly, equilibria from the first two classes are always aligned with the eigenvectors of the value matrix, often but not exclusively with the principal eigenvector.

Abstract: Time-efficient estimation of muscle activations and forces across multi-joint systems is critical for clinical assessment and assistive device control. However, conventional approaches are computationally expensive and lack a high-quality labeled dataset for multi-joint applications. To address these challenges, we propose a physics-informed deep learning framework that estimates muscle activations and forces directly from kinematics. The framework employs a novel Multi-Joint Cross-Attention (MJCA) module with Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) layers to capture inter-joint coordination, enabling each joint to adaptively integrate motion information from others. By embedding multi-joint dynamics, inter-joint coupling, and external force interactions into the loss function, our Physics-Informed MJCA-BiGRU (PI-MJCA-BiGRU) delivers physiologically consistent predictions without labeled data while enabling time-efficient inference. Experimental validation on two datasets demonstrates that PI-MJCA-BiGRU achieves performance comparable to conventional supervised methods without requiring ground-truth labels, while the MJCA module significantly enhances inter-joint coordination modeling compared to other baseline architectures.

Conclusion: SPP-FGC通过结构图介导的知识共享机制，成功解决了联邦聚类中性能与隐私的权衡问题，为去中心化无标签数据的模式提取提供了有效的隐私保护解决方案。

Abstract: Federated clustering addresses the critical challenge of extracting patterns from decentralized, unlabeled data. However, it is hampered by the flaw that current approaches are forced to accept a compromise between performance and privacy: \textit{transmitting embedding representations risks sensitive data leakage, while sharing only abstract cluster prototypes leads to diminished model accuracy}. To resolve this dilemma, we propose Structural Privacy-Preserving Federated Graph Clustering (SPP-FGC), a novel algorithm that innovatively leverages local structural graphs as the primary medium for privacy-preserving knowledge sharing, thus moving beyond the limitations of conventional techniques. Our framework operates on a clear client-server logic; on the client-side, each participant constructs a private structural graph that captures intrinsic data relationships, which the server then securely aggregates and aligns to form a comprehensive global graph from which a unified clustering structure is derived. The framework offers two distinct modes to suit different needs. SPP-FGC is designed as an efficient one-shot method that completes its task in a single communication round, ideal for rapid analysis. For more complex, unstructured data like images, SPP-FGC+ employs an iterative process where clients and the server collaboratively refine feature representations to achieve superior downstream performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving clustering accuracy by up to 10\% (NMI) over federated baselines while maintaining provable privacy guarantees.

Conclusion: GraphToxin揭示了图遗忘方法对重建攻击的严重脆弱性，亟需开发更有效和鲁棒的防御策略来应对此类隐私威胁

Abstract: Graph unlearning has emerged as a promising solution for complying with "the right to be forgotten" regulations by enabling the removal of sensitive information upon request. However, this solution is not foolproof. The involvement of multiple parties creates new attack surfaces, and residual traces of deleted data can still remain in the unlearned graph neural networks. These vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to recover the supposedly erased samples, thereby undermining the inherent functionality of graph unlearning. In this work, we propose GraphToxin, the first graph reconstruction attack against graph unlearning. Specifically, we introduce a novel curvature matching module to provide a fine-grained guidance for full unlearned graph recovery. We demonstrate that GraphToxin can successfully subvert the regulatory guarantees expected from graph unlearning - it can recover not only a deleted individual's information and personal links but also sensitive content from their connections, thereby posing substantially more detrimental threats. Furthermore, we extend GraphToxin to multiple node removals under both white-box and black-box setting. We highlight the necessity of a worst-case analysis and propose a comprehensive evaluation framework to systematically assess the attack performance under both random and worst-case node removals. This provides a more robust and realistic measure of the vulnerability of graph unlearning methods to graph reconstruction attacks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of GraphToxin. Notably, we show that existing defense mechanisms are largely ineffective against this attack and, in some cases, can even amplify its performance. Given the severe privacy risks posed by GraphToxin, our work underscores the urgent need for the development of more effective and robust defense strategies against this attack.

Conclusion: 在边缘推理的不确定性环境下，适应性决策策略（如LCB和汤普森采样）对高效推理至关重要。

Abstract: Motivated by the challenges of edge inference, we study a variant of the cascade bandit model in which each arm corresponds to an inference model with an associated accuracy and error probability. We analyse four decision-making policies-Explore-then-Commit, Action Elimination, Lower Confidence Bound (LCB), and Thompson Sampling-and provide sharp theoretical regret guarantees for each. Unlike in classical bandit settings, Explore-then-Commit and Action Elimination incur suboptimal regret because they commit to a fixed ordering after the exploration phase, limiting their ability to adapt. In contrast, LCB and Thompson Sampling continuously update their decisions based on observed feedback, achieving constant O(1) regret. Simulations corroborate these theoretical findings, highlighting the crucial role of adaptivity for efficient edge inference under uncertainty.

Abstract: Model merging combines expert models for multitask performance but faces challenges from parameter interference. This has sparked recent interest in controllable model merging, giving users the ability to explicitly balance performance trade-offs. Existing approaches employ a compile-then-query paradigm, performing a costly offline multi-objective optimization to enable fast, preference-aware model generation. This offline stage typically involves iterative search or dedicated training, with complexity that grows exponentially with the number of tasks. To overcome these limitations, we shift the perspective from parameter-space optimization to a direct correction of the model's final representation. Our approach models this correction as an optimal linear transformation, yielding a closed-form solution that replaces the entire offline optimization process with a single-step, architecture-agnostic computation. This solution directly incorporates user preferences, allowing a Pareto-optimal model to be generated on-the-fly with complexity that scales linearly with the number of tasks. Experimental results show our method generates a superior Pareto front with more precise preference alignment and drastically reduced computational cost.

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to transfer knowledge from a label-rich source domain to an unlabeled target domain by addressing domain shifts. Most UDA approaches emphasize transfer ability, but often overlook robustness against adversarial attacks. Although vanilla adversarial training (VAT) improves the robustness of deep neural networks, it has little effect on UDA. This paper focuses on answering three key questions: 1) Why does VAT, known for its defensive effectiveness, fail in the UDA paradigm? 2) What is the generalization bound theory under attacks and how does it evolve from classical UDA theory? 3) How can we implement a robustification training procedure without complex modifications? Specifically, we explore and reveal the inherent entanglement challenge in general UDA+VAT paradigm, and propose an unsupervised robust domain adaptation (URDA) paradigm. We further derive the generalization bound theory of the URDA paradigm so that it can resist adversarial noise and domain shift. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to establish the URDA paradigm and theory. We further introduce a simple, novel yet effective URDA algorithm called Disentangled Adversarial Robustness Training (DART), a two-step training procedure that ensures both transferability and robustness. DART first pre-trains an arbitrary UDA model, and then applies an instantaneous robustification post-training step via disentangled distillation.Experiments on four benchmark datasets with/without attacks show that DART effectively enhances robustness while maintaining domain adaptability, and validate the URDA paradigm and theory.

Conclusion: ScaPT通过高效参数共享和多样性保证机制，成功解决了零样本协调中种群规模扩展性的问题。

Abstract: Zero-shot coordination(ZSC) has become a hot topic in reinforcement learning research recently. It focuses on the generalization ability of agents, requiring them to coordinate well with collaborators that are not seen before without any fine-tuning. Population-based training has been proven to provide good zero-shot coordination performance; nevertheless, existing methods are limited by computational resources, mainly focusing on optimizing diversity in small populations while neglecting the potential performance gains from scaling population size. To address this issue, this paper proposes the Scalable Population Training (ScaPT), an efficient training framework comprising two key components: a meta-agent that efficiently realizes a population by selectively sharing parameters across agents, and a mutual information regularizer that guarantees population diversity. To empirically validate the effectiveness of ScaPT, this paper evaluates it along with representational frameworks in Hanabi and confirms its superiority.

Abstract: Many Knowledege Graphs (KGs) are frequently updated, forcing their Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGEs) to adapt to these changes. To address this problem, continual learning techniques for KGEs incorporate embeddings for new entities while updating the old ones. One necessary step in these methods is the initialization of the embeddings, as an input to the KGE learning process, which can have an important impact in the accuracy of the final embeddings, as well as in the time required to train them. This is especially relevant for relatively small and frequent updates. We propose a novel informed embedding initialization strategy, which can be seamlessly integrated into existing continual learning methods for KGE, that enhances the acquisition of new knowledge while reducing catastrophic forgetting. Specifically, the KG schema and the previously learned embeddings are utilized to obtain initial representations for the new entities, based on the classes the entities belong to. Our extensive experimental analysis shows that the proposed initialization strategy improves the predictive performance of the resulting KGEs, while also enhancing knowledge retention. Furthermore, our approach accelerates knowledge acquisition, reducing the number of epochs, and therefore time, required to incrementally learn new embeddings. Finally, its benefits across various types of KGE learning models are demonstrated.

Abstract: Detecting point anomalies in bank account balances is essential for financial institutions, as it enables the identification of potential fraud, operational issues, or other irregularities. Robust statistics is useful for flagging outliers and for providing estimates of the data distribution parameters that are not affected by contaminated observations. However, such a strategy is often less efficient and computationally expensive under high dimensional setting. In this paper, we propose and evaluate empirically several robust approaches that may be computationally efficient in medium and high dimensional datasets, with high breakdown points and low computational time. Our application deals with around 2.6 million daily records of anonymous users' bank account balances.

Abstract: Deep learning models for precipitation forecasting often function as black boxes, limiting their adoption in real-world weather prediction. To enhance transparency while maintaining accuracy, we developed an interpretable deep learning framework for short-term precipitation prediction in four major Indian cities: Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata, spanning diverse climate zones. We implemented a hybrid Time-Distributed CNN-ConvLSTM (Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory) architecture, trained on multi-decadal ERA5 reanalysis data. The architecture was optimized for each city with a different number of convolutional filters: Bengaluru (32), Mumbai and Delhi (64), and Kolkata (128). The models achieved root mean square error (RMSE) values of 0.21 mm/day (Bengaluru), 0.52 mm/day (Mumbai), 0.48 mm/day (Delhi), and 1.80 mm/day (Kolkata). Through interpretability analysis using permutation importance, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), temporal occlusion, and counterfactual perturbation, we identified distinct patterns in the model's behavior. The model relied on city-specific variables, with prediction horizons ranging from one day for Bengaluru to five days for Kolkata. This study demonstrates how explainable AI (xAI) can provide accurate forecasts and transparent insights into precipitation patterns in diverse urban environments.

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical challenge of improving predictions of climate extreme events, specifically heat waves, using machine learning methods. Our work is framed as a classification problem in which we try to predict whether surface air temperature will exceed its q-th local quantile within a specified timeframe. Our key finding is that aggregating ensemble predictions using a power mean significantly enhances the classifier's performance. By making a machine-learning based weather forecasting model generative and applying this non-linear aggregation method, we achieve better accuracy in predicting extreme heat events than with the typical mean prediction from the same model. Our power aggregation method shows promise and adaptability, as its optimal performance varies with the quantile threshold chosen, demonstrating increased effectiveness for higher extremes prediction.

Abstract: Learning governing equations from data is central to understanding the behavior of physical systems across diverse scientific disciplines, including physics, biology, and engineering. The Sindy algorithm has proven effective in leveraging sparsity to identify concise models of nonlinear dynamical systems. In this paper, we extend sparsity-driven approaches to real-time learning by integrating a cornerstone algorithm from control theory -- the Kalman filter (KF). The resulting Sindy Kalman Filter (SKF) unifies both frameworks by treating unknown system parameters as state variables, enabling real-time inference of complex, time-varying nonlinear models unattainable by either method alone. Furthermore, SKF enhances KF parameter identification strategies, particularly via look-ahead error, significantly simplifying the estimation of sparsity levels, variance parameters, and switching instants. We validate SKF on a chaotic Lorenz system with drifting or switching parameters and demonstrate its effectiveness in the real-time identification of a sparse nonlinear aircraft model built from real flight data.

Conclusion: DGIMVCM通过动态图学习、掩码图重建损失和伪标签自监督训练，有效解决了不完全多视图聚类中的关键挑战

Abstract: The prevalence of real-world multi-view data makes incomplete multi-view clustering (IMVC) a crucial research. The rapid development of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has established them as one of the mainstream approaches for multi-view clustering. Despite significant progress in GNNs-based IMVC, some challenges remain: (1) Most methods rely on the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to construct static graphs from raw data, which introduces noise and diminishes the robustness of the graph topology. (2) Existing methods typically utilize the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss between the reconstructed graph and the sparse adjacency graph directly as the graph reconstruction loss, leading to substantial gradient noise during optimization. To address these issues, we propose a novel \textbf{D}ynamic Deep \textbf{G}raph Learning for \textbf{I}ncomplete \textbf{M}ulti-\textbf{V}iew \textbf{C}lustering with \textbf{M}asked Graph Reconstruction Loss (DGIMVCM). Firstly, we construct a missing-robust global graph from the raw data. A graph convolutional embedding layer is then designed to extract primary features and refined dynamic view-specific graph structures, leveraging the global graph for imputation of missing views. This process is complemented by graph structure contrastive learning, which identifies consistency among view-specific graph structures. Secondly, a graph self-attention encoder is introduced to extract high-level representations based on the imputed primary features and view-specific graphs, and is optimized with a masked graph reconstruction loss to mitigate gradient noise during optimization. Finally, a clustering module is constructed and optimized through a pseudo-label self-supervised training mechanism. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets validate the effectiveness and superiority of DGIMVCM.

Conclusion: LoRaCompass在领域偏移和信号波动下实现了稳健高效的LoRa标签搜索，适用于地面和无人机辅助场景

Abstract: The Long-Range (LoRa) protocol, known for its extensive range and low power, has increasingly been adopted in tags worn by mentally incapacitated persons (MIPs) and others at risk of going missing. We study the sequential decision-making process for a mobile sensor to locate a periodically broadcasting LoRa tag with the fewest moves (hops) in general, unknown environments, guided by the received signal strength indicator (RSSI). While existing methods leverage reinforcement learning for search, they remain vulnerable to domain shift and signal fluctuation, resulting in cascading decision errors that culminate in substantial localization inaccuracies. To bridge this gap, we propose LoRaCompass, a reinforcement learning model designed to achieve robust and efficient search for a LoRa tag. For exploitation under domain shift and signal fluctuation, LoRaCompass learns a robust spatial representation from RSSI to maximize the probability of moving closer to a tag, via a spatially-aware feature extractor and a policy distillation loss function. It further introduces an exploration function inspired by the upper confidence bound (UCB) that guides the sensor toward the tag with increasing confidence. We have validated LoRaCompass in ground-based and drone-assisted scenarios within diverse unseen environments covering an area of over 80km^2. It has demonstrated high success rate (>90%) in locating the tag within 100m proximity (a 40% improvement over existing methods) and high efficiency with a search path length (in hops) that scales linearly with the initial distance.

Conclusion: 该零样本合成验证框架能显著提高联邦学习的训练效率，在几乎不损失精度的情况下大幅减少计算成本。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across decentralized devices while preserving data privacy. However, FL methods typically run for a predefined number of global rounds, often leading to unnecessary computation when optimal performance is reached earlier. In addition, training may continue even when the model fails to achieve meaningful performance. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a zero-shot synthetic validation framework that leverages generative AI to monitor model performance and determine early stopping points. Our approach adaptively stops training near the optimal round, thereby conserving computational resources and enabling rapid hyperparameter adjustments. Numerical results on multi-label chest X-ray classification demonstrate that our method reduces training rounds by up to 74% while maintaining accuracy within 1% of the optimal.

Result: 在四个基准数据集上优于十种最先进防御方法，在各种攻击场景中表现出优异鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HealSplit提供强大的端到端防御解决方案，显著提升分裂联邦学习安全性。

Abstract: Split Federated Learning (SFL) is an emerging paradigm for privacy-preserving distributed learning. However, it remains vulnerable to sophisticated data poisoning attacks targeting local features, labels, smashed data, and model weights. Existing defenses, primarily adapted from traditional Federated Learning (FL), are less effective under SFL due to limited access to complete model updates. This paper presents HealSplit, the first unified defense framework tailored for SFL, offering end-to-end detection and recovery against five sophisticated types of poisoning attacks. HealSplit comprises three key components: (1) a topology-aware detection module that constructs graphs over smashed data to identify poisoned samples via topological anomaly scoring (TAS); (2) a generative recovery pipeline that synthesizes semantically consistent substitutes for detected anomalies, validated by a consistency validation student; and (3) an adversarial multi-teacher distillation framework trains the student using semantic supervision from a Vanilla Teacher and anomaly-aware signals from an Anomaly-Influence Debiasing (AD) Teacher, guided by the alignment between topological and gradient-based interaction matrices. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that HealSplit consistently outperforms ten state-of-the-art defenses, achieving superior robustness and defense effectiveness across diverse attack scenarios.

TL;DR: 基于电子健康记录（EHR）的预测模型在识别八种主要癌症高风险人群方面优于传统风险因素（年龄、吸烟史等），能实现3-6倍的真实癌症病例富集，EHR基础模型还能扩展到26种癌症类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前癌症筛查指南仅覆盖少数癌症类型，依赖年龄或单一风险因素等狭窄标准识别高风险人群，基于EHR的预测模型有望通过捕捉细微诊断前信号更有效地识别高风险群体。

Method: 使用All of Us研究项目中865,000多名参与者的EHR、基因组和调查数据，系统评估基于EHR的预测模型与传统风险因素（包括基因突变和癌症家族史）在识别八种主要癌症高风险人群方面的临床效用。

Result: 即使使用基线建模方法，基于EHR的模型在识别为高风险人群中真实癌症病例的富集度比单独使用传统风险因素高3-6倍；EHR基础模型进一步在26种癌症类型中提高了预测性能。

Conclusion: 基于EHR的预测模型具有临床潜力，可支持更精准和可扩展的早期检测策略，在癌症筛查中比传统风险因素更有效。

Abstract: Current cancer screening guidelines cover only a few cancer types and rely on narrowly defined criteria such as age or a single risk factor like smoking history, to identify high-risk individuals. Predictive models using electronic health records (EHRs), which capture large-scale longitudinal patient-level health information, may provide a more effective tool for identifying high-risk groups by detecting subtle prediagnostic signals of cancer. Recent advances in large language and foundation models have further expanded this potential, yet evidence remains limited on how useful HER-based models are compared with traditional risk factors currently used in screening guidelines. We systematically evaluated the clinical utility of EHR-based predictive models against traditional risk factors, including gene mutations and family history of cancer, for identifying high-risk individuals across eight major cancers (breast, lung, colorectal, prostate, ovarian, liver, pancreatic, and stomach), using data from the All of Us Research Program, which integrates EHR, genomic, and survey data from over 865,000 participants. Even with a baseline modeling approach, EHR-based models achieved a 3- to 6-fold higher enrichment of true cancer cases among individuals identified as high risk compared with traditional risk factors alone, whether used as a standalone or complementary tool. The EHR foundation model, a state-of-the-art approach trained on comprehensive patient trajectories, further improved predictive performance across 26 cancer types, demonstrating the clinical potential of EHR-based predictive modeling to support more precise and scalable early detection strategies.

Conclusion: 该工作有助于以更低的训练数据集成本为阴极材料实现高精度MLFF训练，并为MLFF在阴极材料计算模拟中的应用提供了新视角。

Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs), which employ neural networks to map atomic structures to system energies, effectively combine the high accuracy of first-principles calculation with the computational efficiency of empirical force fields. They are widely used in computational materials simulations. However, the development and application of MLFFs for lithium-ion battery cathode materials remain relatively limited. This is primarily due to the complex electronic structure characteristics of cathode materials and the resulting scarcity of high-quality computational datasets available for force field training. In this work, we develop a multi-fidelity machine learning force field framework to enhance the data efficiency of computational results, which can simultaneously utilize both low-fidelity non-magnetic and high-fidelity magnetic computational datasets of cathode materials for training. Tests conducted on the lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) cathode material system demonstrate the effectiveness of this multi-fidelity approach. This work helps to achieve high-accuracy MLFF training for cathode materials at a lower training dataset cost, and offers new perspectives for applying MLFFs to computational simulations of cathode materials.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘AI系统需要适应不同任务并受限于严格的内存约束，传统反向传播训练需要存储层激活值和优化器状态，限制了可部署模型的最大规模。

Method: 采用MeZO（内存高效零阶优化）方法，仅通过前向评估来估计梯度，消除中间激活值和优化器状态的存储需求，使更大模型能够适合片上内存。

Conclusion: MeZO方法有效解决了边缘AI系统在内存受限环境下的模型微调问题，虽然可能需要更长的训练时间，但能支持更大规模的模型部署，在设备端AI应用中具有重要价值。

Abstract: On-device fine-tuning is a critical capability for edge AI systems, which must support adaptation to different agentic tasks under stringent memory constraints. Conventional backpropagation (BP)-based training requires storing layer activations and optimizer states, a demand that can be only partially alleviated through checkpointing. In edge deployments in which the model weights must reside entirely in device memory, this overhead severely limits the maximum model size that can be deployed. Memory-efficient zeroth-order optimization (MeZO) alleviates this bottleneck by estimating gradients using forward evaluations alone, eliminating the need for storing intermediate activations or optimizer states. This enables significantly larger models to fit within on-chip memory, albeit at the cost of potentially longer fine-tuning wall-clock time. This paper first provides a theoretical estimate of the relative model sizes that can be accommodated under BP and MeZO training. We then numerically validate the analysis, demonstrating that MeZO exhibits accuracy advantages under on-device memory constraints, provided sufficient wall-clock time is available for fine-tuning.

Abstract: Phase-time arrays, which integrate phase shifters (PSs) and true-time delays (TTDs), have emerged as a cost-effective architecture for generating frequency-dependent rainbow beams in wideband sensing and localization. This paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning-based scheme that simultaneously designs the rainbow beams and estimates user positions. Treating the PS and TTD coefficients as trainable variables allows the network to synthesize task-oriented beams that maximize localization accuracy. A lightweight fully connected module then recovers the user's angle-range coordinates from its feedback of the maximum quantized received power and its corresponding subcarrier index after a single downlink transmission. Compared with existing analytical and learning-based schemes, the proposed method reduces overhead by an order of magnitude and delivers consistently lower two-dimensional positioning error.

Conclusion: 多标定是提升基于预测权重进行图匹配性能的有效方法，可以补偿预测器的不完美性，达到与最佳决策规则相当的竞争力。

Abstract: Consider the problem of finding the best matching in a weighted graph where we only have access to predictions of the actual stochastic weights, based on an underlying context. If the predictor is the Bayes optimal one, then computing the best matching based on the predicted weights is optimal. However, in practice, this perfect information scenario is not realistic. Given an imperfect predictor, a suboptimal decision rule may compensate for the induced error and thus outperform the standard optimal rule.
  In this paper, we propose multicalibration as a way to address this problem. This fairness notion requires a predictor to be unbiased on each element of a family of protected sets of contexts. Given a class of matching algorithms $\mathcal C$ and any predictor $γ$ of the edge-weights, we show how to construct a specific multicalibrated predictor $\hat γ$, with the following property. Picking the best matching based on the output of $\hat γ$ is competitive with the best decision rule in $\mathcal C$ applied onto the original predictor $γ$. We complement this result by providing sample complexity bounds.

Method: 使用JAX-FEM自动微分进行边界导纳估计，结合随机有限差分和PyTorch3D网格操作进行形状优化，将物理驱动的边界优化与几何驱动的内部网格适配分离。

Result: 实现了边界导纳的3位数精度估计，在形状优化中达到了48.1%的能量减少，相比标准有限差分方法减少了30倍FEM求解次数。

Conclusion: 现代可微分编程工具能够快速实现物理逆问题的优化工作流，自动微分适用于参数估计，而有限差分与AD结合适用于几何设计。

Abstract: We demonstrate a practical differentiable programming approach for acoustic inverse problems through two applications: admittance estimation and shape optimization for resonance damping. First, we show that JAX-FEM's automatic differentiation (AD) enables direct gradient-based estimation of complex boundary admittance from sparse pressure measurements, achieving 3-digit precision without requiring manual derivation of adjoint equations. Second, we apply randomized finite differences to acoustic shape optimization, combining JAX-FEM for forward simulation with PyTorch3D for mesh manipulation through AD. By separating physics-driven boundary optimization from geometry-driven interior mesh adaptation, we achieve 48.1% energy reduction at target frequencies with 30-fold fewer FEM solutions compared to standard finite difference on the full mesh. This work showcases how modern differentiable software stacks enable rapid prototyping of optimization workflows for physics-based inverse problems, with automatic differentiation for parameter estimation and a combination of finite differences and AD for geometric design.

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) generative models offer efficient simulation-free training and deterministic sampling, but their practical deployment is challenged by high-precision parameter requirements. We adapt optimal transport (OT)-based post-training quantization to FM models, minimizing the 2-Wasserstein distance between quantized and original weights, and systematically compare its effectiveness against uniform, piecewise, and logarithmic quantization schemes. Our theoretical analysis provides upper bounds on generative degradation under quantization, and empirical results across five benchmark datasets of varying complexity show that OT-based quantization preserves both visual generation quality and latent space stability down to 2-3 bits per parameter, where alternative methods fail. This establishes OT-based quantization as a principled, effective approach to compress FM generative models for edge and embedded AI applications.

Conclusion: RETROFIT在无需历史数据的条件下有效缓解了持续学习中的遗忘问题，在安全分析任务中展现出优越的适应性能力和知识保留能力。

Abstract: Modern security analytics are increasingly powered by deep learning models, but their performance often degrades as threat landscapes evolve and data representations shift. While continual learning (CL) offers a promising paradigm to maintain model effectiveness, many approaches rely on full retraining or data replay, which are infeasible in data-sensitive environments. Moreover, existing methods remain inadequate for security-critical scenarios, facing two coupled challenges in knowledge transfer: preserving prior knowledge without old data and integrating new knowledge with minimal interference.
  We propose RETROFIT, a data retrospective-free continual learning method that achieves bounded forgetting for effective knowledge transfer. Our key idea is to consolidate previously trained and newly fine-tuned models, serving as teachers of old and new knowledge, through parameter-level merging that eliminates the need for historical data. To mitigate interference, we apply low-rank and sparse updates that confine parameter changes to independent subspaces, while a knowledge arbitration dynamically balances the teacher contributions guided by model confidence. Our evaluation on two representative applications demonstrates that RETROFIT consistently mitigates forgetting while maintaining adaptability. In malware detection under temporal drift, it substantially improves the retention score, from 20.2% to 38.6% over CL baselines, and exceeds the oracle upper bound on new data. In binary summarization across decompilation levels, where analyzing stripped binaries is especially challenging, RETROFIT achieves around twice the BLEU score of transfer learning used in prior work and surpasses all baselines in cross-representation generalization.

Abstract: Diffusion models produce high quality images but inference is costly due to many denoising steps and heavy matrix operations. We present DiffPro, a post-training, hardware-faithful framework that works with the exact integer kernels used in deployment and jointly tunes timesteps and per-layer precision in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) to reduce latency and memory without any training. DiffPro combines three parts: a manifold-aware sensitivity metric to allocate weight bits, dynamic activation quantization to stabilize activations across timesteps, and a budgeted timestep selector guided by teacher-student drift. In experiments DiffPro achieves up to 6.25x model compression, fifty percent fewer timesteps, and 2.8x faster inference with Delta FID <= 10 on standard benchmarks, demonstrating practical efficiency gains. DiffPro unifies step reduction and precision planning into a single budgeted deployable plan for real-time energy-aware diffusion inference.

Conclusion: FairReweighing算法能有效提高回归任务的公平性，在保持高准确率的同时显著改善分离度表现。

Abstract: There has been a prevalence of applying AI software in both high-stakes public-sector and industrial contexts. However, the lack of transparency has raised concerns about whether these data-informed AI software decisions secure fairness against people of all racial, gender, or age groups. Despite extensive research on emerging fairness-aware AI software, up to now most efforts to solve this issue have been dedicated to binary classification tasks. Fairness in regression is relatively underexplored. In this work, we adopted a mutual information-based metric to assess separation violations. The metric is also extended so that it can be directly applied to both classification and regression problems with both binary and continuous sensitive attributes. Inspired by the Reweighing algorithm in fair classification, we proposed a FairReweighing pre-processing algorithm based on density estimation to ensure that the learned model satisfies the separation criterion. Theoretically, we show that the proposed FairReweighing algorithm can guarantee separation in the training data under a data independence assumption. Empirically, on both synthetic and real-world data, we show that FairReweighing outperforms existing state-of-the-art regression fairness solutions in terms of improving separation while maintaining high accuracy.

Motivation: 重新审视多步预测中关于递归策略和直接策略偏误-方差权衡的传统观点，通过理论分析解释这些策略在实际中的表现差异

Method: 将多步预测误差分解为三部分：不可约噪声、结构近似差距和估计方差；对于线性预测器证明结构差距为零；对于非线性预测器分析递归组合如何影响模型表达能力；引入基于雅可比矩阵的放大因子分析估计方差

Result: 发现在非线性预测器中，递归策略可能同时具有更低偏差和更高方差；在ETTm1数据集上使用多层感知机的实验验证了这些发现

Conclusion: 在选择递归或直接策略时，应基于模型非线性特性和噪声特征，而非依赖传统的偏误-方差直觉，这为多步预测策略选择提供了新的实践指导

Abstract: Multi-step forecasting is often described through a simple rule of thumb: recursive strategies are said to have high bias and low variance, while direct strategies are said to have low bias and high variance. We revisit this belief by decomposing the expected multi-step forecast error into three parts: irreducible noise, a structural approximation gap, and an estimation-variance term. For linear predictors we show that the structural gap is identically zero for any dataset. For nonlinear predictors, however, the repeated composition used in recursion can increase model expressivity, making the structural gap depend on both the model and the data. We further show that the estimation variance of the recursive strategy at any horizon can be written as the one-step variance multiplied by a Jacobian-based amplification factor that measures how sensitive the composed predictor is to parameter error. This perspective explains when recursive forecasting may simultaneously have lower bias and higher variance than direct forecasting. Experiments with multilayer perceptrons on the ETTm1 dataset confirm these findings. The results offer practical guidance for choosing between recursive and direct strategies based on model nonlinearity and noise characteristics, rather than relying on traditional bias-variance intuition.

Abstract: We present a pure machine learning process for synthesizing radar spectrograms from Motion-Capture (MoCap) data. We formulate MoCap-to-spectrogram translation as a windowed sequence-to-sequence task using a transformer-based model that jointly captures spatial relations among MoCap markers and temporal dynamics across frames. Real-world experiments show that the proposed approach produces visually and quantitatively plausible doppler radar spectrograms and achieves good generalizability. Ablation experiments show that the learned model includes both the ability to convert multi-part motion into doppler signatures and an understanding of the spatial relations between different parts of the human body.
  The result is an interesting example of using transformers for time-series signal processing. It is especially applicable to edge computing and Internet of Things (IoT) radars. It also suggests the ability to augment scarce radar datasets using more abundant MoCap data for training higher-level applications. Finally, it requires far less computation than physics-based methods for generating radar data.

Abstract: Conformal prediction constructs a set of labels instead of a single point prediction, while providing a probabilistic coverage guarantee. Beyond the coverage guarantee, adaptiveness to example difficulty is an important property. It means that the method should produce larger prediction sets for more difficult examples, and smaller ones for easier examples. Existing evaluation methods for adaptiveness typically analyze coverage rate violation or average set size across bins of examples grouped by difficulty. However, these approaches often suffer from imbalanced binning, which can lead to inaccurate estimates of coverage or set size. To address this issue, we propose a binning method that leverages input transformations to sort examples by difficulty, followed by uniform-mass binning. Building on this binning, we introduce two metrics to better evaluate adaptiveness. These metrics provide more reliable estimates of coverage rate violation and average set size due to balanced binning, leading to more accurate adaptivity assessment. Through experiments, we demonstrate that our proposed metric correlates more strongly with the desired adaptiveness property compared to existing ones. Furthermore, motivated by our findings, we propose a new adaptive prediction set algorithm that groups examples by estimated difficulty and applies group-conditional conformal prediction. This allows us to determine appropriate thresholds for each group. Experimental results on both (a) an Image Classification (ImageNet) (b) a medical task (visual acuity prediction) show that our method outperforms existing approaches according to the new metrics.

Abstract: Understanding reactor-pressure-vessel steel microstructure is crucial for predicting mechanical properties, as carbide precipitates both strengthen the alloy and can initiate cracks. In scanning electron microscopy images, gray-value overlap between carbides and matrix makes simple thresholding ineffective. We present a data-efficient segmentation pipeline using a lightweight U-Net (30.7~M parameters) trained on just \textbf{10 annotated scanning electron microscopy images}. Despite limited data, our model achieves a \textbf{Dice-Sørensen coefficient of 0.98}, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art in the field of metallurgy (classical image analysis: 0.85), while reducing annotation effort by one order of magnitude compared to the state-of-the-art data efficient segmentation model. This approach enables rapid, automated carbide quantification for alloy design and generalizes to other steel types, demonstrating the potential of data-efficient deep learning in reactor-pressure-vessel steel analysis.

Abstract: Blocking communication presents a major hurdle in running MoEs efficiently in distributed settings. To address this, we present FarSkip-Collective which modifies the architecture of modern models to enable overlapping of their computation with communication. Our approach modifies the architecture to skip connections in the model and it is unclear a priori whether the modified model architecture can remain as capable, especially for large state-of-the-art models and while modifying all of the model layers. We answer this question in the affirmative and fully convert a series of state-of-the-art models varying from 16B to 109B parameters to enable overlapping of their communication while achieving accuracy on par with their original open-source releases. For example, we convert Llama 4 Scout (109B) via self-distillation and achieve average accuracy within 1% of its instruction tuned release averaged across a wide range of downstream evaluations. In addition to demonstrating retained accuracy of the large modified models, we realize the benefits of FarSkip-Collective through optimized implementations that explicitly overlap communication with computation, accelerating both training and inference in existing frameworks.

Abstract: Clustering is a fundamental task in machine learning and data analysis, but it frequently fails to provide fair representation for various marginalized communities defined by multiple protected attributes -- a shortcoming often caused by biases in the training data. As a result, there is a growing need to enhance the fairness of clustering outcomes, ideally by making minimal modifications, possibly as a post-processing step after conventional clustering. Recently, Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25] initiated the study of \emph{closest fair clustering}, though in a restricted scenario where data points belong to only two groups. In practice, however, data points are typically characterized by many groups, reflecting diverse protected attributes such as age, ethnicity, gender, etc.
  In this work, we generalize the study of the \emph{closest fair clustering} problem to settings with an arbitrary number (more than two) of groups. We begin by showing that the problem is NP-hard even when all groups are of equal size -- a stark contrast with the two-group case, for which an exact algorithm exists. Next, we propose near-linear time approximation algorithms that efficiently handle arbitrary-sized multiple groups, thereby answering an open question posed by Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25].
  Leveraging our closest fair clustering algorithms, we further achieve improved approximation guarantees for the \emph{fair correlation clustering} problem, advancing the state-of-the-art results established by Ahmadian et al. [AISTATS'20] and Ahmadi et al. [2020]. Additionally, we are the first to provide approximation algorithms for the \emph{fair consensus clustering} problem involving multiple (more than two) groups, thus addressing another open direction highlighted by Chakraborty et al. [COLT'25].

Conclusion: 

Abstract: Mixture of Block Attention (MoBA) (Lu et al., 2025) is a promising building block for efficiently processing long contexts in LLMs by enabling queries to sparsely attend to a small subset of key-value blocks, drastically reducing computational cost. However, the design principles governing MoBA's performance are poorly understood, and it lacks an efficient GPU implementation, hindering its practical adoption. In this paper, we first develop a statistical model to analyze MoBA's underlying mechanics. Our model reveals that performance critically depends on the router's ability to accurately distinguish relevant from irrelevant blocks based on query-key affinities. We derive a signal-to-noise ratio that formally connects architectural parameters to this retrieval accuracy. Guided by our analysis, we identify two key pathways for improvement: using smaller block sizes and applying a short convolution on keys to cluster relevant signals, which enhances routing accuracy. While theoretically better, small block sizes are inefficient on GPUs. To bridge this gap, we introduce FlashMoBA, a hardware-aware CUDA kernel that enables efficient MoBA execution even with the small block sizes our theory recommends. We validate our insights by training LLMs from scratch, showing that our improved MoBA models match the performance of dense attention baselines. FlashMoBA achieves up to 14.7x speedup over FlashAttention-2 for small blocks, making our theoretically-grounded improvements practical.
