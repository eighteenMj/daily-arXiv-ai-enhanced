Objectives: To compare image quality and diagnostic performance of SR, low-resolution (LR), and high-resolution (HR) 7T knee MRI. Methods: In this prospective study, 42 participants underwent 7T knee MRI with LR (0.8*0.8*2 mm3) and HR (0.4*0.4*2 mm3) sequences. SR images were generated from LR data using a Hybrid Attention Transformer model. Three radiologists assessed image quality, anatomic conspicuity, and detection of knee pathologies. Arthroscopy served as reference in 10 cases. Results: SR images showed higher overall quality than LR (median score 5 vs 4, P<.001) and lower noise than HR (5 vs 4, P<.001). Visibility of cartilage, menisci, and ligaments was superior in SR and HR compared to LR (P<.001). Detection rates and diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity, AUC) for intra-articular pathology were similar across image types (P>=.095).

Energy-Based Models (EBMs), with their interpretable energy landscapes and compositional structure, are well-suited for this task but have historically suffered from high computational costs and training instability. To overcome the historical shortcomings of EBMs, we introduce a fast distillation strategy to transfer the strengths of pre-trained diffusion models into multi-scale EBMs. These distilled EBMs enable efficient sampling and preserve the interpretability and compositionality inherent to potential-based frameworks. Leveraging EBM compositionality, we propose Annealed Langevin Posterior Sampling (ALPS) algorithm for Maximum-A-Posteriori (MAP), Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE), and uncertainty estimates for inverse problems in imaging. Unlike diffusion models that use complex guidance strategies for latent variables, we perform annealing on static posterior distributions that are well-defined and composable. Experiments on image inpainting and MRI reconstruction demonstrate that our method matches or surpasses diffusion-based baselines in both accuracy and efficiency, while also supporting MAP recovery. Overall, our framework offers a scalable and principled solution for inverse problems in imaging, with potential for practical deployment in scientific and clinical settings.

By employing a constructed state-space model, two control schemes are developed in a unified framework: a state-feedback controller and a sliding mode controller, both integrated with a second-order DOb. The proposed framework achieves high-performance motion control by precisely estimating and compensating for internal and external disturbances, while preserving the nominal dynamic response. Simulation results demonstrate that pole-placement-based controllers are highly sensitive to disturbances, whereas LQR-based controllers offer improved robustness at the expense of slower dynamics. By incorporating DOb, robustness is significantly enhanced without degrading time response, and the LQR controller can be tuned solely for performance optimization. Experimental results confirm that the proposed robust position controllers can be implemented in real world applications. These results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach and lay the foundation for future investigations on robust stability and performance under different stiffness settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Although textual explanations are easily understood by humans, ensuring their correctness remains a challenge, and evaluations in state-of-the-art remain limited. We present a novel XRL framework for generating textual explanations, converting them into a set of transparent rules, improving their quality, and evaluating them. Expert's knowledge can be incorporated into this framework, and an automatic predicate generator is also proposed to determine the semantic information of a state. Textual explanations are generated using a Large Language Model (LLM) and a clustering technique to identify frequent conditions. These conditions are then converted into rules to evaluate their properties, fidelity, and performance in the deployed environment. Two refinement techniques are proposed to improve the quality of explanations and reduce conflicting information. Experiments were conducted in three open-source environments to enable reproducibility, and in a telecom use case to evaluate the industrial applicability of the proposed XRL framework. This framework addresses the limitations of an existing method, Autonomous Policy Explanation, and the generated transparent rules can achieve satisfactory performance on certain tasks. This framework also enables a systematic and quantitative evaluation of textual explanations, providing valuable insights for the XRL field.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

At the meso level, their aggregated state evolves on a learned Neural Differential Manifold (NDM) under Hamiltonian flows and Hamilton, Jacobi, Bellman (HJB) optimal control, discretized by symplectic layers that approximately preserve geometric and energetic invariants. At the macro level, the model maintains a generative semantic workspace and a two-dimensional information-phase portrait that tracks uncertainty and information gain over a reasoning trajectory. Within this hierarchy, reasoning tasks are formulated as controlled information flows on the manifold, with solutions corresponding to low cost trajectories that satisfy geometric, energetic, and workspace-consistency constraints. On simple toy problems involving numerical integration and dynamical systems, the physical transformer outperforms naive baselines in stability and long-horizon accuracy, highlighting the benefits of respecting underlying geometric and Hamiltonian structure. More broadly, the framework suggests a path toward physical AI that unify digital reasoning with physically grounded manifolds, opening a route to more interpretable and potentially unified models of reasoning, control, and interaction with the real world.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7269\u7406transformer\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5c06transformer\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u3001\u7269\u7406\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c42\u6b21\u5316\u7ed3\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u7269\u7406AI\u7684\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u63a8\u7406", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u865a\u62df\u7b26\u53f7/\u50cf\u7d20\u57df\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u6b65\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7269\u7406\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u7684\u8054\u7cfb\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u6570\u5b57\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u53d1\u5c55\u66f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u80fd\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u7269\u7406AI", "method": "\u5fae\u89c2\uff1a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u548c\u524d\u9988\u5757\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u91cf\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u81ea\u65cb\uff1b\u4ecb\u89c2\uff1a\u805a\u5408\u6001\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u5fae\u5206\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u968f\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u6d41\u91cf\u5316\u6f14\u53d8\uff1b\u5b8f\u89c2\uff1a\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u5de5\u4f5c\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u76f8\u56fe\u8ddf\u8e2a\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u589e\u76ca\u3002\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u8868\u8ff0\u4e3a\u6d41\u5f62\u4e0a\u7684\u53d7\u63a7\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u503c\u79ef\u5206\u548c\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7b49\u7b80\u5355\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\uff0c\u7269\u7406transformer\u5728\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6734\u7d20\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u54c8\u5bc6\u987f\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7269\u7406AI\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5c06\u6570\u5b57\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u6d41\u5f62\u7edf\u4e00\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u53d1\u5c55\u66f4\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4ea4\u4e92\u6a21\u578b"}}

To address this, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has mandated that no single UPI app should exceed 30 percent of total transaction volume. Enforcing this cap, however, poses a significant computational challenge: how to redistribute user transactions across apps without causing widespread user inconvenience while maintaining capacity limits? In this paper, we formalize this problem as the Minimum Edge Activation Flow (MEAF) problem on a bipartite network of users and apps, where activating an edge corresponds to a new app installation. The objective is to ensure a feasible flow respecting app capacities while minimizing additional activations. We further prove that Minimum Edge Activation Flow is NP-Complete. To address the computational challenge, we propose scalable heuristics, named Decoupled Two-Stage Allocation Strategy (DTAS), that exploit flow structure and capacity reuse. Experiments on large semi-synthetic transaction network data show that DTAS finds solutions close to the optimal ILP within seconds, offering a fast and practical way to enforce transaction caps fairly and efficiently.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This paper presents a Swin Transformer UNet 3D (SwinUNet3D) framework for lesion segmentation in Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography / Computed Tomography (FDG-PET/CT) scans. By combining shifted window self-attention with U-Net style skip connections, the model captures both global context and fine anatomical detail. We evaluate SwinUNet3D on the AutoPET III FDG dataset and compare it against a baseline 3D U-Net. Results show that SwinUNet3D achieves a Dice score of 0.88 and IoU of 0.78, surpassing 3D U-Net (Dice 0.48, IoU 0.32) while also delivering faster inference times. Qualitative analysis demonstrates improved detection of small and irregular lesions, reduced false positives, and more accurate PET/CT fusion. While the framework is currently limited to FDG scans and trained under modest GPU resources, it establishes a strong foundation for future multi-tracer, multi-center evaluations and benchmarking against other transformer-based architectures.

Integrating tool calling across multiple LLM providers remains a core engineering challenge due to fragmented APIs, incompatible message formats, and inconsistent streaming and tool-calling behavior, making it difficult to build portable, reliable agent systems. We introduce Orchestral, a lightweight Python framework that provides a unified, type-safe interface for building LLM agents across major providers while preserving the simplicity required for scientific computing and production deployment. Orchestral defines a single universal representation for messages, tools, and LLM usage that operates seamlessly across providers, eliminating manual format translation and reducing framework-induced complexity. Automatic tool schema generation from Python type hints removes the need for handwritten descriptors while maintaining type safety across provider boundaries. A synchronous execution model with streaming support enables deterministic behavior, straightforward debugging, and real-time interaction without introducing server dependencies. The framework's modular architecture cleanly separates provider integration, tool execution, conversation orchestration, and user-facing interfaces, enabling extensibility without architectural entanglement. Orchestral supports advanced agent capabilities found in larger frameworks, including rich tool calling, context compaction, workspace sandboxing, user approval workflows, sub-agents, memory management, and MCP integration.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Therefore, we propose a novel approach called Modality Interaction and Alignment Representation (MIAR). This network integrates contextual features across different modalities using a feature interaction to generate feature tokens to represent global representations of this modality extracting information from other modalities. These four tokens represent global representations of how each modality extracts information from others. MIAR aligns different modalities using contrastive learning and normalization strategies.

The design focuses on adaptive traffic filtering and lightweight policy enforcement instead of complex analytical models, making it suitable for medium-sized network environments. The prototype gateway was deployed in a real office with around 70 total devices, including 28 IoT units such as sensors, cameras, and smart controllers. Over ten days of continuous operation, the system reduced successful spoofing incidents by 87% and improved recovery time after deauthentication by 42%, while increasing network latency by only 3.1% and reducing throughput by less than 4% compared to a baseline WPA3 configuration.

We evaluated MLLM architectures on knee osteoarthritis (OA) radiograph classification, which remains underrepresented in existing medical MLLM benchmarks, even though knee OA affects an estimated 300 to 400 million people worldwide. Through systematic ablation studies manipulating the vision encoder, the connector, and the large language model (LLM) across diverse training strategies, we measured each component's contribution to diagnostic accuracy. In our classification task, a trained vision encoder alone could outperform full MLLM pipelines in classification accuracy and fine-tuning the LLM provided no meaningful improvement over prompt-based guidance. And LoRA fine-tuning on a small, class-balanced dataset (500 images) gave better results than training on a much larger but class-imbalanced set (5,778 images), indicating that data balance and quality can matter more than raw scale for this task. These findings suggest that for domain-specific medical classification, LLMs are more effective as interpreters and report generators rather than as primary classifiers. Therefore, the MLLM architecture appears less suitable for medical image diagnostic classification tasks that demand high certainty.

Rather than producing isolated outputs, such systems operate continuously under feedback, adaptation, and scale, reshaping physical flows, human behavior, and institutional practice over time. In these settings, socially unacceptable outcomes rarely arise from singular faults or explicit policy violations. Instead, they emerge through cumulative execution trajectories enabled by repetition, concurrency, and feedback.\n  This paper advances the formal foundation of the Social Responsibility Stack (SRS) by making its central requirement explicit: responsibility is fundamentally a reachability property of system execution. A system is responsible iff its execution semantics prevent entry into inadmissible global configurations, regardless of local performance gains or optimization objectives. Responsibility failures are therefore not objective-level errors, but execution-level failures of trajectory control.\n  To operationalize this perspective, we introduce Petri nets as an execution-level formalism for responsible autonomous systems. We show how SRS value commitments correspond to forbidden markings, safeguards to structural constraints on transition firing, auditing to monitoring of reachability pressure, and governance to legitimate modification of execution structure. Embedding Petri-net reachability within the SRS architecture internalizes responsibility as a structural invariant rather than an external objective or post-hoc mechanism.\n  These results establish the Social Responsibility Stack as an executable responsibility architecture and position reachability-based execution semantics as a necessary foundation for responsible autonomy in feedback-rich cyber-physical and socio-technical systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To this end, we focus on a task of translating live-stream chat messages and manually construct LiveChatBench, a benchmark consisting of 1,000 Korean-English parallel sentence pairs.

Most of the existing literature assumes that the underlying space is Euclidean. However, in many practical applications, the data are constrained to lie on a submanifold of Euclidean space. Addressing this setting, De Bortoli et al. (2022) introduced Riemannian diffusion models and proved that using an exponentially small step size yields a small sampling error in the Wasserstein distance, provided the data distribution is smooth and strictly positive, and the score estimate is $L_\\infty$-accurate. In this paper, we greatly strengthen this theory by establishing that, under $L_2$-accurate score estimate, a {\\em polynomially small stepsize} suffices to guarantee small sampling error in the total variation distance, without requiring smoothness or positivity of the data distribution.

Current methodologies lack accurate representation of spatio-temporal-causal interdependencies and class imbalance in failure prediction tasks. This study introduces a Topology-Aware Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer (ST-GT) architecture that overcomes existing limitations by using three main innovations: (1) directly incorporating physical transmission network topology into the transformer attention mechanism to identify spatial failure propagation patterns; (2) unified processing of static topological descriptors and (3) temporal Phasor Measurement Units (PMU) sequences in an end-to-end framework.\n  The ST-GT model exhibited outstanding performance in five-fold cross-validation across 10 substations, attaining perfect recall (1.000 $\\pm$ 0.001) and an F1-score of 0.858 $\\pm$ 0.009, markedly surpassing XGBoost baselines (0.683 accuracy/F1). Perfect recall guarantees that no critical failures are overlooked, which is essential for grid safety; however, it may lead to an increase in false alarm rates. This framework integrates temporal dynamics modeling with spatial graph awareness for critical infrastructure monitoring. It offers interpretable insights into failure propagation pathways and enhances maintenance strategies. Future research focuses on developing cost-weighted loss functions for precision-recall trade-off enhancement, implementing real-time monitoring systems with uncertainty quantification, and creating cost-sensitive frameworks balancing false alarm expenditures with failure consequences. The methodology success suggests its potential for wider application in critical infrastructure areas requiring spatial temporal failure prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

The conventional methods, i.e., the fractional programming (FP) method and the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm, can be computationally demanding for two reasons: (i) they require inverting a sequence of matrices whose sizes are proportional to the number of antennas; (ii) they require tuning a set of Lagrange multipliers to account for the power constraints. The recently proposed method called the reduced WMMSE addresses the above two issues for a single cell. In contrast, for the multicell case, another recent method called the FastFP eliminates the large matrix inversion and the Lagrange multipliers by using an improved FP technique, but the update stepsize in the FastFP can be difficult to decide. As such, we propose integrating the deep unfolding network into the FastFP for the stepsize optimization. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method is much more efficient than the learning method based on the WMMSE algorithm.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recently, unsupervised learning of data group structure with deep learning methods has gained popularity. TURTLE, a state of the art deep clustering algorithm, uncovers data labeling without supervision by alternating label and hyperplane updates, maximizing the hyperplane margin, in a similar fashion to support vector machines (SVMs). However, TURTLE assumes clusters are balanced; when data is imbalanced, it yields non-ideal hyperplanes that cause higher clustering error. We propose PET-TURTLE, which generalizes the cost function to handle imbalanced data distributions by a power law prior. Additionally, by introducing sparse logits in the labeling process, PET-TURTLE optimizes a simpler search space that in turn improves accuracy for balanced datasets.

However, the inherent topology dynamics of low earth orbit satellite networks and the uncertain network scales bring an inevitable requirement that resource chains for E2E service provisioning must be efficiently re-planned. Therefore, achieving highly adaptive resource management is of great significance in practical deployment applications. This paper first designs a regional resource management (RRM) mode and further formulates the RRM problem that can provide a unified decision space independent of the network scale. Subsequently, leveraging the RRM mode and deep reinforcement learning framework, we develop a topology feature-based dynamic and adaptive resource management algorithm to combat the varying network scales. The proposed algorithm successfully takes into account the fixed output dimension of the neural network and the changing resource chains for E2E service provisioning. The matched design of the service orientation information and phased reward function effectively improves the service performance of the algorithm under the RRM mode. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm with the best convergence performance and fastest convergence rate significantly improves service performance for varying network scales, with gains over compared algorithms of more than 2.7%, 11.9%, and 10.2%, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

However, DP adopts a context-free definition that operates independently of the data-generating distribution. In this paper, we revisit the privacy analysis of the Laplace mechanism through the lens of pointwise maximal leakage (PML). We demonstrate that the distribution-agnostic definition of the DP framework often mandates excessive noise. To address this, we incorporate an assumption about the prior distribution by lower-bounding the probability of any single record belonging to any specific class. With this assumption, we derive a tight, context-aware leakage bound for general linear queries, and prove that our derived bound is strictly tighter than the standard DP guarantee and converges to the DP guarantee as this probability lower bound approaches zero. Numerical evaluations demonstrate that by exploiting this prior knowledge, the required noise scale can be reduced while maintaining privacy guarantees.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

As PoW blockchains see broader adoption, an increasingly diverse set of miners with varying computing capabilities participate in the network. In this paper, we consider the PoW blockchain mining, where the miners are associated with resource uncertainties. To characterize the uncertainty computing resources at different mining participants, we establish an ambiguous set representing uncertainty of resource distributions. Then, the networked mining is formulated as a non-cooperative game, where distributionally robust performance is calculated for each individual miner to tackle the resource uncertainties. We prove the existence of the equilibrium of the distributionally robust mining game. To derive the equilibrium, we propose the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR)-based reinterpretation of the best response of each miner. We then solve the individual strategy with alternating optimization, which facilitates the iteration among miners towards the game equilibrium. Furthermore, we consider the case that the ambiguity of resource distribution reduces to Gaussian distribution and the case that another uncertainties vanish, and then characterize the properties of the equilibrium therein along with a distributed algorithm to achieve the equilibrium. Simulation results show that the proposed approaches effectively converge to the equilibrium, and effectively tackle the uncertainties in blockchain mining to achieve a robust performance guarantee.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

This principle is equally critical in prompt engineering, where designing effective prompts for large language models constitutes a complex optimization challenge. A structured optimization approach requires automated or semi-automated procedures to develop improved prompts, thereby reducing manual effort, improving performance, and yielding an interpretable process. However, current prompt optimization methods often induce prompt drift, where new prompts fix prior failures but impair performance on previously successful tasks. Additionally, generating prompts from scratch can compromise interpretability. To address these limitations, this study proposes the Hierarchical Attribution Prompt Optimization (HAPO) framework, which introduces three innovations: (1) a dynamic attribution mechanism targeting error patterns in training data and prompting history, (2) semantic-unit optimization for editing functional prompt segments, and (3) multimodal-friendly progression supporting both end-to-end LLM and LLM-MLLM workflows.

Pruning has emerged as a promising direction for reducing ViT complexity. However, existing approaches either (i) produce a single pruned model shared across all devices, ignoring device heterogeneity, or (ii) rely on fine-tuning with device-local data, which is often infeasible due to limited on-device resources and strict privacy constraints. As a result, current methods fall short of enabling task-customized ViT pruning in privacy-preserving mobile computing settings. This paper introduces TAP-ViTs, a novel task-adaptive pruning framework that generates device-specific pruned ViT models without requiring access to any raw local data. Specifically, to infer device-level task characteristics under privacy constraints, we propose a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-based metric dataset construction mechanism. Each device fits a lightweight GMM to approximate its private data distribution and uploads only the GMM parameters. Using these parameters, the cloud selects distribution-consistent samples from public data to construct a task-representative metric dataset for each device. Based on this proxy dataset, we further develop a dual-granularity importance evaluation-based pruning strategy that jointly measures composite neuron importance and adaptive layer importance, enabling fine-grained, task-aware pruning tailored to each device's computational budget. Extensive experiments across multiple ViT backbones and datasets demonstrate that TAP-ViTs consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pruning methods under comparable compression ratios.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Physics generally describes mechanical happenings, but there remains an unbridgeable gap between them and the acts of agents. To discuss the morality and responsibility of agents, it is necessary to model acts; whether such responsible acts can be fully explained by physical determinism has been debated. Although we have already proposed a physical \"agent determinism\" model that appears to go beyond mere mechanical happenings, we have not yet established a strict mathematical formalism to eliminate ambiguity. Here, we explain why a physical system can follow coarse-graining agent-level determination without violating physical laws by formulating supervenient causation. Generally, supervenience including coarse graining does not change without a change in its lower base; therefore, a single supervenience alone cannot define supervenient causation. We define supervenient causation as the causal efficacy from the supervenience level to its lower base level. Although an algebraic expression composed of the multiple supervenient functions does supervenes on the base, a sequence of indices that determines the algebraic expression does not supervene on the base. Therefore, the sequence can possess unique dynamical laws that are independent of the lower base level. This independent dynamics creates the possibility for temporally preceding changes at the supervenience level to cause changes at the lower base level. Such a dual-laws system is considered useful for modeling self-determining agents such as humans.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u968f\u9644\u56e0\u679c\u7684\u8d85\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u9762\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8bd5\u56fe\u4e3a\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u63d0\u4f9b\u6570\u5b66\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u5e76\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u5728\u4e0d\u8fdd\u53cd\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u5f8b\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\uff08agency\uff09\u5efa\u7acb\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u8ba4\u77e5\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7269\u7406\u673a\u68b0\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0e\u80fd\u52a8\u884c\u4e3a\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u65e2\u80fd\u89e3\u91ca\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u5b9a\u53c8\u4e0d\u8fdd\u53cd\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u201c\u968f\u9644\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u201d\uff08supervenient causation\uff09\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u4e2a\u968f\u9644\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u4ee3\u6570\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5176\u7d22\u5f15\u5e8f\u5217\u53ef\u62e5\u6709\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u5e95\u5c42\u7269\u7406\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u4f7f\u4e0a\u5c42\u968f\u9644\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u80fd\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u5730\u5f15\u8d77\u5e95\u5c42\u7269\u7406\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53cc\u91cd\u89c4\u5f8b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff08dual-laws system\uff09\uff1a\u4e0a\u5c42\u968f\u9644\u5c42\u9762\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u7d22\u5f15\u5e8f\u5217\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u52a8\u6001\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u5148\u4e8e\u5e95\u5c42\u53d8\u5316\u5e76\u5bf9\u5176\u4ea7\u751f\u56e0\u679c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4e3a\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u6211\u51b3\u5b9a\u7684\u80fd\u52a8\u8005\uff08\u5982\u4eba\u7c7b\uff09\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5efa\u6a21\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u968f\u9644\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\u6a21\u578b\u4e3a\u8fde\u63a5\u7269\u7406\u673a\u68b0\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e0e\u80fd\u52a8\u6027\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u5b9a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u5728\u9075\u5faa\u7269\u7406\u89c4\u5f8b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u5c42\u968f\u9644\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u52a8\u6001\u5b9e\u73b0\u8d85\u8d8a\u5355\u7eaf\u673a\u68b0\u8fd0\u52a8\u7684\u80fd\u52a8\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

However, it remains unclear how textual information contributes to quality prediction and to what extent text can represent the score-related image contents. This work addresses these questions from an information-flow perspective by comparing existing BIQA models with three paradigms designed to learn the image-text-score relationship: Chain-of-Thought, Self-Consistency, and Autoencoder. Our experiments show that the score prediction performance of the existing model significantly drops when only textual information is used for prediction. Whereas the Chain-of-Thought paradigm introduces little improvement in BIQA performance, the Self-Consistency paradigm significantly reduces the gap between image- and text-conditioned predictions, narrowing the PLCC/SRCC difference to 0.02/0.03. The Autoencoder-like paradigm is less effective in closing the image-text gap, yet it reveals a direction for further optimization. These findings provide insights into how to improve the textual reasoning for BIQA and high-level vision tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Consider a distributed system with $K$ users, where each user $k\\in [K]$ holds a data stream $W_k$ and an individual key $Z_k$. A server aims to compute a linear function $\\mathbf{F}[W_1;\\ldots;W_K]$ without learning any information about another linear function $\\mathbf{G}[W_1;\\ldots;W_K]$, where $[W_1;\\ldots;W_K]$ denotes the row stack of $W_1,\\ldots,W_K$. The open problem is to determine the minimum required length of $Z_k$, denoted as $R_k$, $k\\in [K]$. In this paper, we characterize a new achievable region for the rate tuple $(R_1,\\ldots,R_K)$. The region is polyhedral, with vertices characterized by a binary rate assignment $(R_1,\\ldots,R_K) = (\\mathbf{1}(1 \\in \\mathcal{I}),\\ldots,\\mathbf{1}(K\\in \\mathcal{I}))$, where $\\mathcal{I}\\subseteq [K]$ satisfies the \\textit{rank-increment condition}: $\\mathrm{rank}\\left(\\bigl[\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathcal{I}};\\mathbf{G}_{\\mathcal{I}}\\bigr]\\right) =\\mathrm{rank}\\bigl(\\mathbf{F}_{\\mathcal{I}}\\bigr)+N$.

Enhancing the ability to transmit medical images and data from rural areas to urban hospitals via wireless networks is critical. However, bandwidth limitations, unreliable networks, and concerns over data security and privacy hinder efficient transmission. Additionally, the high data volume of medical content and the limited battery life of IoT devices pose further challenges. To address these challenges, data compression techniques such as Autoencoders (AEs) offer promising solutions by significantly reducing the communication overhead without sacrificing essential image quality or details. Additionally, spectrum allocation mechanisms in rural areas are often inefficient, leading to poor resource utilization. Auction theory presents a dynamic and adaptive approach to optimize spectrum allocation. This paper proposes a novel hybrid framework that integrates AE-based data compression with auction-based spectrum allocation, addressing both communication efficiency and spectrum utilization in rural wireless networks.

However, the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and data throughput in BLE are highly susceptible to environmental variability, which degrades communication performance. In this work, we systematically analyze the interdependence among RSSI, throughput, transmission power (TXP), and the peripheral device system power consumption under diverse real-world conditions. We observe that adjusting the TXP effectively influences both RSSI and throughput. We propose a robust closed-loop TXP control framework based on Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers. Two initial control strategies are investigated: an RSSI-based approach and a throughput-based approach, each exhibiting distinct advantages and limitations. The RSSI-based method provides rapid responsiveness to signal fluctuations but lacks direct correlation with data throughput, whereas the throughput-based method offers more accurate feedback on effective throughput at the cost of slower response. To address these limitations, a hybrid RSSI-throughput control strategy is developed, combining the responsiveness of RSSI feedback with the accuracy of throughput measurements. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid approach maintains data throughput close to the target level with minimal variance, even under rapidly changing environmental conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Most learning-based methods circumvent the problems arising from the anisotropy by using 2D approaches rather than performing volumetric analyses. These approaches inherently bear the risk of generating inconsistent results for neighboring B-scans. For example, 2D retinal layer segmentations can have irregular surfaces in 3D. Furthermore, the typically used convolutional neural networks are bound to the resolution of the training data, which prevents their usage for images acquired with a different imaging protocol. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently emerged as a tool to store voxelized data as a continuous representation. Using coordinates as input, INRs are resolution-agnostic, which allows them to be applied to anisotropic data. In this paper, we propose two frameworks that make use of this characteristic of INRs for dense 3D analyses of retinal OCT volumes. 1) We perform inter-B-scan interpolation by incorporating additional information from en-face modalities, that help retain relevant structures between B-scans. 2) We create a resolution-agnostic retinal atlas that enables general analysis without strict requirements for the data. Both methods leverage generalizable INRs, improving retinal shape representation through population-based training and allowing predictions for unseen cases.

This paper introduces the Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel-Upper Confidence Bound (QNTK-UCB) algorithm, a novel algorithm that leverages the Quantum Neural Tangent Kernel (QNTK) to address these limitations.\n  By freezing the QNN at a random initialization and utilizing its static QNTK as a kernel for ridge regression, QNTK-UCB bypasses the unstable training dynamics inherent in explicit parameterized quantum circuit training while fully exploiting the unique quantum inductive bias. For a time horizon $T$ and $K$ actions, our theoretical analysis reveals a significantly improved parameter scaling of $\u03a9((TK)^3)$ for QNTK-UCB, a substantial reduction compared to $\u03a9((TK)^8)$ required by classical NeuralUCB algorithms for similar regret guarantees. Empirical evaluations on non-linear synthetic benchmarks and quantum-native variational quantum eigensolver tasks demonstrate QNTK-UCB's superior sample efficiency in low-data regimes. This work highlights how the inherent properties of QNTK provide implicit regularization and a sharper spectral decay, paving the way for achieving ``quantum advantage'' in online learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While cell-level inconsistencies provide early warning signals of degradation and safety risks, the lack of scalable and interpretable decision-support frameworks prevents these signals from being effectively translated into operational actions. Here we introduce an inconsistency-driven operation and maintenance paradigm for large-scale BESSs that systematically transforms routine monitoring data into explainable, decision-oriented guidance. The proposed framework integrates multi-dimensional inconsistency evaluation with large language model-based semantic reasoning to bridge the gap between quantitative diagnostics and practical maintenance decisions. Using eight months of field data from an in-service battery system comprising 3,564 cells, we demonstrate how electrical, thermal, and aging-related inconsistencies can be distilled into structured operational records and converted into actionable maintenance insights through a multi-agent framework. The proposed approach enables accurate and explainable responses to real-world operation and maintenance queries, reducing response time and operational cost by over 80% compared with conventional expert-driven practices.

As a result, improvements in human-like behavior are largely driven by scale or broad supervised training, rather than targeted alignment. We introduce Human Aligning LLMs (HAL), a framework for aligning language models to conversational human-likeness using an interpretable, data-driven reward. HAL derives explicit conversational traits from contrastive dialogue data, combines them into a compact scalar score, and uses this score as a transparent reward signal for alignment with standard preference optimization methods. Using this approach, we align models of varying sizes without affecting their overall performance. In large-scale human evaluations, models aligned with HAL are more frequently perceived as human-like in conversation. Because HAL operates over explicit, interpretable traits, it enables inspection of alignment behavior and diagnosis of unintended effects. More broadly, HAL demonstrates how soft, qualitative properties of language--previously outside the scope for alignment--can be made measurable and aligned in an interpretable and explainable way.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86HAL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4ece\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7279\u5f81\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u5728\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e2d\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u957f\u671f\u4ee5\u6765\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9a\u4e49\u3001\u6d4b\u91cf\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u5f53\u524d\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u5927\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6269\u589e\u89c4\u6a21\u6216\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "1. \u4ece\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5bf9\u8bdd\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2. \u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u7ec4\u5408\u6210\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u6807\u91cf\u5206\u6570\uff1b3. \u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u5206\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3a\u900f\u660e\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "1. \u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u540c\u89c4\u6a21\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff1b2. \u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528HAL\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u9891\u7e41\u5730\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u8bdd\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff1b3. \u53ef\u68c0\u67e5\u5bf9\u9f50\u884c\u4e3a\u5e76\u8bca\u65ad\u610f\u5916\u6548\u5e94\u3002", "conclusion": "HAL\u6846\u67b6\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u4e2d\u8f6f\u6027\u7684\u3001\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u5c5e\u6027\uff08\u4ee5\u5f80\u96be\u4ee5\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u8303\u56f4\uff09\u53d8\u5f97\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u4ee5\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u53ef\u8bf4\u660e\u7684\u65b9\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002"}}

Recent approaches leverage vision and language foundation models to directly solve dense tasks through multi-view renderings and text queries. While promising, these pipelines require expensive inference over multiple renderings, depend heavily on large language-model (LLM) prompt engineering for captions, and fail to exploit the inherent 3D geometry of shapes. We address this gap by introducing an encoder-only 3D model that produces language-aligned patch-level features directly from point clouds. Our pre-training approach builds on existing data engines that generate part-annotated 3D shapes by pairing multi-view SAM regions with VLM captioning. Using this data, we train a point cloud transformer encoder in two stages: (1) distillation of dense 2D features from visual encoders such as DINOv2 into 3D patches, and (2) alignment of these patch embeddings with part-level text embeddings through a multi-positive contrastive objective. Our 3D encoder achieves zero-shot 3D part segmentation with fast single-pass inference without any test-time multi-view rendering, while significantly outperforming previous rendering-based and feed-forward approaches across several 3D part segmentation benchmarks.

A Systematic Evaluation of Advanced Deep Forecasting Models Accuracy and Efficiency for Network Traffic Prediction", "comment": "19 pages, 13 figures", "summary": "Network traffic prediction is essential for automating modern network management. It is a difficult time series forecasting (TSF) problem that has been addressed by Deep Learning (DL) models due to their ability to capture complex patterns. Advances in forecasting, from sophisticated transformer architectures to simple linear models, have improved performance across diverse prediction tasks. However, given the variability of network traffic across network environments and traffic series timescales, it is essential to identify effective deployment choices and modeling directions for network traffic prediction. This study systematically identify and evaluates twelve advanced TSF models -including transformer-based and traditional DL approaches, each with unique advantages for network traffic prediction- against three statistical baselines on four real traffic datasets, across multiple time scales and horizons, assessing performance, robustness to anomalies, data gaps, external factors, data efficiency, and resource efficiency in terms of time, memory, and energy. Results highlight performance regimes, efficiency thresholds, and promising architectures that balance accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating robustness to traffic challenges and suggesting new directions beyond traditional RNNs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

While belief states are sufficient for SOC in partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), they are generally infinite-dimensional and impractical. We interpret truncated input-output (IO) histories as inducing a belief approximation and develop a metric-based theory that directly relates information loss to control performance. Using the Wasserstein metric, we derive policy-conditional performance bounds that quantify value degradation induced by finite memory along typical closed-loop trajectories. Our analysis proceeds via a fixed-policy comparison: we evaluate two cost functionals under the same closed-loop execution and isolate the effect of replacing the true belief by its finite memory approximation inside the belief-level cost. For linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) systems, we provide closed-form belief mismatch evaluation and empirically validate the predicted mechanism, demonstrating that belief mismatch decays approximately exponentially with memory length and that the induced performance mismatch scales accordingly. Together, these results provide a metric-aware characterization of what finite memory belief approximation can and cannot achieve in PO settings.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u968f\u673a\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u9650\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4fe1\u5ff5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u622a\u65ad\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u5386\u53f2\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4fe1\u5ff5\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u5173\u8054\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u4f7f\u7528Wasserstein\u5ea6\u91cf\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u6761\u4ef6\u6027\u80fd\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6cbf\u5178\u578b\u95ed\u73af\u8f68\u8ff9\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u9000\u5316\u3002\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u4e8c\u6b21\u9ad8\u65af\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u95ed\u5f0f\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5931\u914d\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5931\u914d\u968f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u957f\u5ea6\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u5931\u914d\u76f8\u5e94\u7f29\u653e\u3002", "motivation": "\u4fe1\u5ff5\u72b6\u6001\u5728\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u867d\u7136\u5145\u5206\uff0c\u4f46\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u65e0\u9650\u7ef4\u4e14\u4e0d\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76f4\u63a5\u91cf\u5316\u6709\u9650\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u8054\u7cfb\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u622a\u65ad\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\u5386\u53f2\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4fe1\u5ff5\u8fd1\u4f3c\uff1b\u53d1\u5c55\u57fa\u4e8e\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528Wasserstein\u5ea6\u91cf\u63a8\u5bfc\u7b56\u7565\u6761\u4ef6\u6027\u80fd\u8fb9\u754c\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u95ed\u73af\u6267\u884c\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e24\u4e2a\u6210\u672c\u6cdb\u51fd\uff0c\u9694\u79bb\u771f\u5b9e\u4fe1\u5ff5\u88ab\u6709\u9650\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8fd1\u4f3c\u66ff\u4ee3\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u4e8c\u6b21\u9ad8\u65af\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u95ed\u5f0f\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5931\u914d\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u9884\u6d4b\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u91cf\u5316\u6709\u9650\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5f15\u8d77\u4ef7\u503c\u9000\u5316\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8fb9\u754c\uff1b\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u4e8c\u6b21\u9ad8\u65af\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u6210\u529f\u8ba1\u7b97\u95ed\u5f0f\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5931\u914d\uff1b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4fe1\u5ff5\u5931\u914d\u968f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u957f\u5ea6\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6307\u6570\u8870\u51cf\uff0c\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5931\u914d\u76f8\u5e94\u7f29\u653e\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4fe1\u5ff5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u611f\u77e5\u7279\u5f81\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4fe1\u5ff5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f4\u63a5\u7406\u8bba\u8054\u7cfb\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u7684Wasserstein\u5ea6\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u91cf\u5316\u8fd1\u4f3c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\uff1b\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\uff1b\u4e3a\u90e8\u5206\u53ef\u89c2\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u9650\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4fe1\u5ff5\u8fd1\u4f3c\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5168\u9762\u7279\u5f81\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002"}}

Current AI approaches suffer from hallucinations in systematic review tasks, with studies reporting rates ranging from 28--40% for earlier models to 2--15% for modern implementations which is unacceptable when errors impact patient care.\n  We present a causal graph-enhanced retrieval-augmented generation system integrating explicit causal reasoning with dual-level knowledge graphs. Our approach enforces evidence-first protocols where every causal claim traces to retrieved literature and automatically generates directed acyclic graphs visualizing intervention-outcome pathways.\n  Evaluation on 234 dementia exercise abstracts shows CausalAgent achieves 95% accuracy, 100% retrieval success, and zero hallucinations versus 34% accuracy and 10% hallucinations for baseline AI. Automatic causal graphs enable explicit mechanism modeling, visual synthesis, and enhanced interpretability.

This paper develops a lightweight computer vision framework that reconciles the efficiency of 2D detection with the necessity of 3D context by reformulating volumetric Computer Tomography (CT) data as sequential video streams. This video-viewpoint paradigm is applied to the time-sensitive task of Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH) detection using the Hemorica dataset. To ensure operational efficiency, we benchmarked multiple generations of the YOLO architecture (v8, v10, v11 and v12) in their Nano configurations, selecting the version with the highest mAP@50 to serve as the slice-level backbone. A ByteTrack algorithm is then introduced to enforce anatomical consistency across the $z$-axis. To address the initialization lag inherent in video trackers, a hybrid inference strategy and a spatiotemporal consistency filter are proposed to distinguish true pathology from transient prediction noise. Experimental results on independent test data demonstrate that the proposed framework serves as a rigorous temporal validator, increasing detection Precision from 0.703 to 0.779 compared to the baseline 2D detector, while maintaining high sensitivity. By approximating 3D contextual reasoning at a fraction of the computational cost, this method provides a scalable solution for real-time patient prioritization in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile stroke units and IoT-enabled remote clinics.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Yet existing VideoQA benchmarks struggle to capture this multimodal reasoning and are largely not open-ended, given the difficulty of evaluating free-form answers. In this paper, we introduce a novel open-ended multi-modal VideoQA benchmark, MovieRecapsQA created using movie recap videos--a distinctive type of YouTube content that summarizes a film by presenting its key events through synchronized visual (recap video) and textual (recap summary) modalities. Using the recap summary, we generate $\\approx 8.2$ K question-answer (QA) pairs (aligned with movie-subtitles) and provide the necessary \"facts\" needed to verify an answer in a reference-free manner. To our knowledge, this is the first open-ended VideoQA benchmark that supplies explicit textual context of the input (video and/or text); which we use for evaluation. Our benchmark provides videos of multiple lengths (i.e., recap-segments, movie-segments) and categorizations of questions (by modality and type) to enable fine-grained analysis. We evaluate the performance of seven state-of-the-art MLLMs using our benchmark and observe that: 1) visual-only questions remain the most challenging; 2) models default to textual inputs whenever available; 3) extracting factually accurate information from video content is still difficult for all models; and 4) proprietary and open-source models perform comparably on video-dependent questions.", "AI": {"tldr": "MovieRecapsQA\u662f\u57fa\u4e8eYouTube\u7535\u5f71\u89e3\u8bf4\u89c6\u9891\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u65b0\u5f00\u653e\u591a\u6a21\u6001VideoQA\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u7ea68.2K\u5e26\u5b57\u5e55\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u663e\u5f0f\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u8bc4\u4f30\uff1b\u5bf97\u4e2aSOTA MLLM\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u63ed\u793a\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u4ecd\u6700\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VideoQA\u57fa\u51c6\u5927\u591a\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u771f\u5b9e\u89c6\u9891\uff08\u5982\u7535\u5f71\uff09\u6240\u9700\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u4e14\u975e\u5f00\u653e\u7b54\u6848\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc4\u4f30\u81ea\u7531\u5f62\u5f0f\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u89c6\u9891/\u6587\u672c\u63d0\u4f9b\u663e\u5f0f\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528YouTube\u7535\u5f71\u89e3\u8bf4\u89c6\u9891\u2014\u2014\u540c\u6b65\u5448\u73b0\u5173\u952e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u89c6\u9891\uff08\u89c6\u89c9\uff09\u548c\u6587\u672c\uff08\u89e3\u8bf4\u603b\u7ed3\uff09\u6a21\u6001\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e3\u8bf4\u603b\u7ed3\u751f\u6210\u7ea68.2K\u4e2a\u4e0e\u7535\u5f71\u5b57\u5e55\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7b54\u6848\u6240\u9700\u7684\u201c\u4e8b\u5b9e\u201d\u4fe1\u606f\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "1) \u4ec5\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u9898\u6700\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff1b2) \u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u65f6\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u4f9d\u8d56\u6587\u672c\uff1b3) \u4ece\u89c6\u9891\u5185\u5bb9\u63d0\u53d6\u51c6\u786e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u56f0\u96be\uff1b4) \u4e13\u6709\u4e0e\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u76f8\u5173\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "MovieRecapsQA\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u63d0\u4f9b\u8f93\u5165\u663e\u5f0f\u6587\u672c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u5f00\u653e\u591a\u6a21\u6001VideoQA\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u7406\u89e3\u53ca\u4e8b\u5b9e\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\uff08\u89c6\u9891\u957f\u5ea6\u3001\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u7c7b\uff09\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

Traditional RTLS either require continuously powered infrastructure, limiting their scalability, or are limited by their responsiveness. This work presents Eco-WakeLoc, designed to achieve centimeter-level UWB localization while remaining energy-neutral by combining ultra-low power wake-up radios (WuRs) with solar energy harvesting. By activating anchor nodes only on demand, the proposed system eliminates constant energy consumption while achieving centimeter-level positioning accuracy. To reduce coordination overhead and improve scalability, Eco-WakeLoc employs cooperative localization where active tags initiate ranging exchanges (trilateration), while passive tags opportunistically reuse these messages for TDOA positioning. An additive-increase/multiplicative-decrease (AIMD)-based energy-aware scheduler adapts localization rates according to the harvested energy, thereby maximizing the overall performance of the sensor network while ensuring long-term energy neutrality. The measured energy consumption is only 3.22mJ per localization for active tags, 951uJ for passive tags, and 353uJ for anchors. Real-world deployment on a quadruped robot with nine anchors confirms the practical feasibility, achieving an average accuracy of 43cm in dynamic indoor environments.

Handling this uncertainty necessitates the use of probabilistic, machine learned models for generating trajectories.

For this reason we propose a physics-informed approach in which aircraft thrust and airspeed are learned from data and are used to condition the existing Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) model, which is physics-based and enforces energy-based constraints on generated trajectories.

We propose a neuro-symbolic DRL approach that integrates background symbolic knowledge to improve sample efficiency and generalization to more challenging, unseen tasks. Partial policies defined for simple domain instances, where high performance is easily attained, are transferred as useful priors to accelerate learning in more complex settings and avoid tuning DRL parameters from scratch. To do so, partial policies are represented as logical rules, and online reasoning is performed to guide the training process through two mechanisms: (i) biasing the action distribution during exploration, and (ii) rescaling Q-values during exploitation. This neuro-symbolic integration enhances interpretability and trustworthiness while accelerating convergence, particularly in sparse-reward environments and tasks with long planning horizons.

In contrast to conventional curriculum strategies that emphasize easier tasks early in training, the resulting schedule naturally focuses training on problems that are neither consistently solved nor consistently failed, while deprioritizing those that contribute little gradient information. The method yields a continuously adapting and automatic prioritization process that requires no predefined difficulty tiers, auxiliary predictors, or external labels. We further introduce lightweight mechanisms for practical deployment, including heap-based prioritized sampling and periodic retesting of solved and unsolved problems to mitigate starvation and forgetting.

To address these gaps, we introduce M3MAD-Bench, a unified and extensible benchmark for evaluating MAD methods across Multi-domain tasks, Multi-modal inputs, and Multi-dimensional metrics. M3MAD-Bench establishes standardized protocols over five core task domains: Knowledge, Mathematics, Medicine, Natural Sciences, and Complex Reasoning, and systematically covers both pure text and vision-language datasets, enabling controlled cross-modality comparison. We evaluate MAD methods on nine base models spanning different architectures, scales, and modality capabilities. Beyond accuracy, M3MAD-Bench incorporates efficiency-oriented metrics such as token consumption and inference time, providing a holistic view of performance--cost trade-offs. Extensive experiments yield systematic insights into the effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency of MAD across text-only and multimodal scenarios.

Generating them from a single photograph in a controllable manner is particularly challenging. Existing image-animation techniques are restricted to simple, low-frequency motions and operate only in narrow domains with repetitive textures like water and smoke. In contrast, large-scale video diffusion models are not tailored for cinemagraph constraints and lack the specialized data required to generate seamless, controlled loops. We present DreamLoop, a controllable video synthesis framework dedicated to generating cinemagraphs from a single photo without requiring any cinemagraph training data. Our key idea is to adapt a general video diffusion model by training it on two objectives: temporal bridging and motion conditioning. This strategy enables flexible cinemagraph generation. During inference, by using the input image as both the first- and last- frame condition, we enforce a seamless loop. By conditioning on static tracks, we maintain a static background. Finally, by providing a user-specified motion path for a target object, our method provides intuitive control over the animation's trajectory and timing.

GPFs first introduce some prompt atoms and then learns the optimal prompt vector for each graph node using the linear combination of prompt atoms. However, existing GPFs generally conduct prompting over node's all feature dimensions which is obviously redundant and also be sensitive to node feature noise. To overcome this issue, for the first time, this paper proposes learning sparse graph prompts by leveraging the spiking neuron mechanism, termed Spiking Graph Prompt Feature (SpikingGPF). Our approach is motivated by the observation that spiking neuron can perform inexpensive information processing and produce sparse outputs which naturally fits the task of our graph sparse prompting. Specifically, SpikingGPF has two main aspects. First, it learns a sparse prompt vector for each node by exploiting a spiking neuron architecture, enabling prompting on selective node features. This yields a more compact and lightweight prompting design while also improving robustness against node noise. Second, SpikingGPF introduces a novel prompt representation learning model based on sparse representation theory, i.e., it represents each node prompt as a sparse combination of prompt atoms.

To address these issues, we propose TaNG, which utilizes a single neural network trained on multi-dimensional features to ensure complete coverage without duplicating rules. TaNG employs a semi-structured design that combines the neural network model with a tuple space, reducing model complexity. Furthermore, we develop a mechanism based on the semi-structure for rule updates.

Specifically, we observe that when the green (G) channel is removed from real images and reconstructed, the resulting reconstruction errors differ significantly from those of AI-generated images. Building upon this insight, we propose G-channel Removed Reconstruction Error (GRRE), a simple yet effective method that exploits this discrepancy for robust AI-generated image detection.

Existing approaches face notable challenges. Filter methods are highly scalable but cannot capture complex relationships or eliminate redundancy. Deep learning-based approaches can model nonlinear patterns but often lack stability, interpretability, and efficiency at scale. Single-head attention improves interpretability but is limited in capturing multi-level dependencies and remains sensitive to initialization, reducing reproducibility. Most existing methods rarely combine statistical interpretability with the representational power of deep learning, particularly in ultra-high-dimensional settings. Here, we introduce MAFS (Multi-head Attention-based Feature Selection), a hybrid framework that integrates statistical priors with deep learning capabilities. MAFS begins with filter-based priors for stable initialization and guide learning. It then uses multi-head attention to examine features from multiple perspectives in parallel, capturing complex nonlinear relationships and interactions. Finally, a reordering module consolidates outputs across attention heads, resolving conflicts and minimizing information loss to generate robust and consistent feature rankings. This design combines statistical guidance with deep modeling capacity, yielding interpretable importance scores while maximizing retention of informative signals. Across simulated and real-world datasets, including cancer gene expression and Alzheimer's disease data, MAFS consistently achieves superior coverage and stability compared with existing filter-based and deep learning-based alternatives, offering a scalable, interpretable, and robust solution for feature selection in high-dimensional biomedical data.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In this paper, we propose oneTwin, the first online digital twin system, for the prediction of physical layer metrics. We architect the oneTwin system with two primary components: an enhanced simulator and a neural radio radiance field (NRRF). On the one hand, we achieve the enhanced simulator by designing a material tuning algorithm that incrementally optimizes the building materials to minimize the twin-to-real gap. On the other hand, we achieve the NRRF by designing a neural learning algorithm that continually updates its DNNs based on both online and simulated data from the enhanced simulator. We implement oneTwin system using Sionna RT as the simulator and developing new DNNs as the NRRF, under a public cellular network.

ReTreVal constructs a structured reasoning tree with adaptive depth based on problem complexity, where each node undergoes iterative self-critique and refinement guided by explicit LLM-generated feedback. A dual validation mechanism evaluates reasoning quality, coherence, and correctness at each node while persistently storing insights from successful reasoning paths and failure patterns in a reflexion memory buffer, enabling cross-problem learning. Critique-based pruning retains only the top-k highest-scoring nodes at each level, controlling computational cost while preserving high-quality solution paths.

Building on this insight, we propose Neuro-Symbolic Curriculum Tuning, a principled framework that adaptively aligns natural language with logical symbols to establish a shared representation, and reshapes training dynamics around phase-transition boundaries to progressively strengthen reasoning at increasing logical depths. Experiments on five benchmarks show that our approach effectively mitigates logical reasoning collapse at high complexity, yielding average accuracy gains of +1.26 in naive prompting and +3.95 in CoT, while improving generalization to unseen logical compositions.

However, current 3D mesh saliency GT acquisition methods are generally consistent with 2D image methods, ignoring the differences between 3D geometry topology and 2D image array. Current VR eye-tracking pipelines rely on single ray sampling and Euclidean smoothing, triggering texture attention and signal leakage across gaps. This paper proposes a robust framework to address these limitations. We first introduce a view cone sampling (VCS) strategy, which simulates the human foveal receptive field via Gaussian-distributed ray bundles to improve sampling robustness for complex topologies. Furthermore, a hybrid Manifold-Euclidean constrained diffusion (HCD) algorithm is developed, fusing manifold geodesic constraints with Euclidean scales to ensure topologically-consistent saliency propagation. By mitigating \"topological short-circuits\" and aliasing, our framework provides a high-fidelity 3D attention acquisition paradigm that aligns with natural human perception, offering a more accurate and robust baseline for 3D mesh saliency research.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

A typical example of such attacks is label poisoning, meaning that some agents possess corrupted local labels and share models trained on these poisoned data. To defend against malicious attacks, existing works often focus on designing robust aggregators; meanwhile, the weighted mean aggregator is typically considered a simple, vulnerable baseline. This paper analyzes the robustness of decentralized gradient descent under label poisoning attacks, considering both robust and weighted mean aggregators. Theoretical results reveal that the learning errors of robust aggregators depend on the network topology, whereas the performance of weighted mean aggregator is topology-independent. Remarkably, the weighted mean aggregator, although often considered vulnerable, can outperform robust aggregators under sufficient heterogeneity, particularly when: (i) the global contamination rate (i.e., the fraction of poisoned agents for the entire network) is smaller than the local contamination rate (i.e., the maximal fraction of poisoned neighbors for the regular agents); (ii) the network of regular agents is disconnected; or (iii) the network of regular agents is sparse and the local contamination rate is high. Empirical results support our theoretical findings, highlighting the important role of network topology in the robustness to label poisoning attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

With the rising computational cost of training large-scale deep models, dataset distillation has emerged as a promising approach for constructing compact synthetic datasets that retain the knowledge of their large original counterparts. However, traditional optimization-based methods often suffer from high computational overhead, memory constraints, and the generation of unrealistic, noise-like images with limited architectural generalization. Recent non-optimization methods alleviate some of these issues by constructing distilled data from real image patches, but the used rigid patch selection strategies can still discard critical information about the main objects. To solve this problem, we first leverage Grounded SAM2 to identify foreground objects and compute per-image foreground occupancy, from which we derive a category-wise patch decision threshold. Guided by these thresholds, we design a dynamic patch selection strategy that, for each image, either selects the most informative patch from multiple candidates or directly resizes the full image when the foreground dominates. This dual-path mechanism preserves more key information about the main objects while reducing redundant background content. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed method consistently improves distillation performance over existing approaches, producing more informative and representative distilled datasets and enhancing robustness across different architectures and image compositions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u524d\u666f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u5bb9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u589e\u5f3a\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5173\u952e\u524d\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59\u80cc\u666f\u5185\u5bb9", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u53d7\u9650\u4e14\u751f\u6210\u566a\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b\u8fd1\u671f\u975e\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u521a\u6027\u5757\u9009\u62e9\u53ef\u80fd\u4e22\u5f03\u4e3b\u8981\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f", "method": "\u5229\u7528Grounded SAM2\u8bc6\u522b\u524d\u666f\u5e76\u8ba1\u7b97\u524d\u666f\u5360\u6709\u7387\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u8bbe\u8ba1\u52a8\u6001\u5757\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u6839\u636e\u9608\u503c\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4fe1\u606f\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5757\u6216\u76f4\u63a5\u8c03\u6574\u5b8c\u6574\u56fe\u50cf\u5927\u5c0f", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u8fdb\u84b8\u998f\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5177\u4fe1\u606f\u6027\u548c\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u6784\u6210\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u524d\u666f\u611f\u77e5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5185\u5bb9\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u4fdd\u7559\u4e86\u4e3b\u8981\u7269\u4f53\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4fe1\u606f"}}

However, existing regression-based approaches often overlook inherent geometric priors, resulting in suboptimal training efficiency and limited localization accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel homography-guided pose estimator network for fine-grained visual localization between multi-view images and standard-definition (SD) maps. We construct input pairs that satisfy a homography constraint by projecting ground-view features into the BEV domain and enforcing semantic alignment with map features. Then we leverage homography relationships to guide feature fusion and restrict the pose outputs to a valid feasible region, which significantly improves training efficiency and localization accuracy compared to prior methods relying on attention-based fusion and direct 3-DoF pose regression. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to unify BEV semantic reasoning with homography learning for image-to-map localization. Furthermore, by explicitly modeling homography transformations, the proposed framework naturally supports cross-resolution inputs, enhancing model flexibility. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art visual localization methods.

In this work, we identify and quantify a fundamental functional perception gap: the inability of current vision encoders to decode functional tracer biodistribution independent of morphological priors. Identifying Positron Emission Tomography (PET) as the quintessential modality to investigate this disconnect, we introduce PET-Bench, the first large-scale functional imaging benchmark comprising 52,308 hierarchical QA pairs from 9,732 multi-site, multi-tracer PET studies. Extensive evaluation of 19 state-of-the-art MLLMs reveals a critical safety hazard termed the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) hallucination trap. We observe that standard CoT prompting, widely considered to enhance reasoning, paradoxically decouples linguistic generation from visual evidence in PET, producing clinically fluent but factually ungrounded diagnoses. To resolve this, we propose Atomic Visual Alignment (AVA), a simple fine-tuning strategy that enforces the mastery of low-level functional perception prior to high-level diagnostic reasoning. Our results demonstrate that AVA effectively bridges the perception gap, transforming CoT from a source of hallucination into a robust inference tool and improving diagnostic accuracy by up to 14.83%.

The current approaches focus on reinforcement learning (RL) and generative models. These efforts imitate offline historical behaviors by utilizing a complex structure with expensive hyperparameter tuning. The suboptimal trajectories further exacerbate the difficulty of policy learning.\n  To address these challenges, we proposes QGA, a novel Q-value regularized Generative Auto-bidding method. In QGA, we propose to plug a Q-value regularization with double Q-learning strategy into the Decision Transformer backbone. This design enables joint optimization of policy imitation and action-value maximization, allowing the learned bidding policy to both leverage experience from the dataset and alleviate the adverse impact of the suboptimal trajectories. Furthermore, to safely explore the policy space beyond the data distribution, we propose a Q-value guided dual-exploration mechanism, in which the DT model is conditioned on multiple return-to-go targets and locally perturbed actions. This entire exploration process is dynamically guided by the aforementioned Q-value module, which provides principled evaluation for each candidate action. Experiments on public benchmarks and simulation environments demonstrate that QGA consistently achieves superior or highly competitive results compared to existing alternatives.

Extended version of our ICCV 2025 highlight paper [arXiv:2503.07940]. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2503.07940", "summary": "Some deep learning-based point cloud registration methods struggle with zero-shot generalization, often requiring dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning or retraining for new environments. We identify three critical limitations: (a) fixed user-defined parameters (e.g., voxel size, search radius) that fail to generalize across varying scales, (b) learned keypoint detectors exhibit poor cross-domain transferability, and (c) absolute coordinates amplify scale mismatches between datasets. To address these three issues, we present BUFFER-X, a training-free registration framework that achieves zero-shot generalization through: (a) geometric bootstrapping for automatic hyperparameter estimation, (b) distribution-aware farthest point sampling to replace learned detectors, and (c) patch-level coordinate normalization to ensure scale consistency. Our approach employs hierarchical multi-scale matching to extract correspondences across local, middle, and global receptive fields, enabling robust registration in diverse environments. For efficiency-critical applications, we introduce BUFFER-X-Lite, which reduces total computation time by 43% (relative to BUFFER-X) through early exit strategies and fast pose solvers while preserving accuracy.

However, in future 6G scenarios characterized by high-speed network entities and fast-changing environments, it is very challenging to meet real-time requirements. Although generative diffusion models (DMs) can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with second-level delay, their iterative nature leads to prohibitive inference latency in delay-sensitive scenarios. In this paper, by uncovering a key structural property of diffusion processes: the latent midpoints remain highly consistent across semantically similar scenes, we propose RadioDiff-Flux, a novel two-stage latent diffusion framework that decouples static environmental modeling from dynamic refinement, enabling the reuse of precomputed midpoints to bypass redundant denoising. In particular, the first stage generates a coarse latent representation using only static scene features, which can be cached and shared across similar scenarios. The second stage adapts this representation to dynamic conditions and transmitter locations using a pre-trained model, thereby avoiding repeated early-stage computation. The proposed RadioDiff-Flux significantly reduces inference time while preserving fidelity. Experiment results show that RadioDiff-Flux can achieve up to 50 acceleration with less than 0.15% accuracy loss, demonstrating its practical utility for fast, scalable RM generation in future 6G networks.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Recent work has made significant progress, but its reliance on large-scale datasets and complex decoders has limited its efficiency and generalization ability. In this paper, we propose a lightweight and data-centric framework for zero-shot monocular depth estimation. We first adopt DINOv3 as the visual encoder to obtain high-quality dense features. Secondly, to address the inherent drawbacks of the complex structure of the DPT, we design the Simple Depth Transformer (SDT), a compact transformer-based decoder. Compared to the DPT, it uses a single-path feature fusion and upsampling process to reduce the computational overhead of cross-scale feature fusion, achieving higher accuracy while reducing the number of parameters by approximately 85%-89%. Furthermore, we propose a quality-based filtering strategy to filter out harmful samples, thereby reducing dataset size while improving overall training quality. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks demonstrate that our framework surpasses the DPT in accuracy.

However, most existing approaches rely heavily on degradation-specific representations, often resulting in oversmoothing and artifacts. To address this, we propose ClearAIR, a novel AiOIR framework inspired by Human Visual Perception (HVP) and designed with a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine restoration strategy. First, leveraging the global priority of early HVP, we employ a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)-based Image Quality Assessment (IQA) model for overall evaluation. Unlike conventional IQA, our method integrates cross-modal understanding to more accurately characterize complex, composite degradations. Building upon this overall assessment, we then introduce a region awareness and task recognition pipeline. A semantic cross-attention, leveraging semantic guidance unit, first produces coarse semantic prompts. Guided by this regional context, a degradation-aware module implicitly captures region-specific degradation characteristics, enabling more precise local restoration. Finally, to recover fine details, we propose an internal clue reuse mechanism. It operates in a self-supervised manner to mine and leverage the intrinsic information of the image itself, substantially enhancing detail restoration.

While recent MLLMs develop strong general-purpose multimodal reasoning capabilities, they fall short in abductive inference, as compared to human beings. To bridge this gap, we draw inspiration from the interplay between verbal and pictorial abduction in human cognition, and propose to strengthen abduction of MLLMs by mimicking such dual-mode behavior. Concretely, we introduce AbductiveMLLM comprising of two synergistic components: REASONER and IMAGINER. The REASONER operates in the verbal domain. It first explores a broad space of possible explanations using a blind LLM and then prunes visually incongruent hypotheses based on cross-modal causal alignment. The remaining hypotheses are introduced into the MLLM as targeted priors, steering its reasoning toward causally coherent explanations. The IMAGINER, on the other hand, further guides MLLMs by emulating human-like pictorial thinking. It conditions a text-to-image diffusion model on both the input video and the REASONER's output embeddings to \"imagine\" plausible visual scenes that correspond to verbal explanation, thereby enriching MLLMs' contextual grounding. The two components are trained jointly in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on standard VAR benchmarks show that AbductiveMLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming traditional solutions and advanced MLLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

To address this, a progressive Earth vision-language understanding and generation framework is proposed, including a multi-task dataset (EarthVLSet) and a semantic-guided network (EarthVLNet). Focusing on city planning applications, EarthVLSet includes 10.9k sub-meter resolution remote sensing images, land-cover masks, and 761.5k textual pairs involving both multiple-choice and open-ended visual question answering (VQA) tasks. In an object-centric way, EarthVLNet is proposed to progressively achieve semantic segmentation, relational reasoning, and comprehensive understanding. The first stage involves land-cover segmentation to generate object semantics for VQA guidance. Guided by pixel-wise semantics, the object awareness based large language model (LLM) performs relational reasoning and knowledge summarization to generate the required answers. As for optimization, the numerical difference loss is proposed to dynamically add difference penalties, addressing the various objects' statistics. Three benchmarks, including semantic segmentation, multiple-choice, and open-ended VQA demonstrated the superiorities of EarthVLNet, yielding three future directions: 1) segmentation features consistently enhance VQA performance even in cross-dataset scenarios; 2) multiple-choice tasks show greater sensitivity to the vision encoder than to the language decoder; and 3) open-ended tasks necessitate advanced vision encoders and language decoders for an optimal performance.

Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that DreamStyle is competent in all three video stylization tasks, and outperforms the competitors in style consistency and video quality.", "AI": {"tldr": "DreamStyle\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u6587\u672c\u5f15\u5bfc\u3001\u98ce\u683c\u56fe\u50cf\u5f15\u5bfc\u548c\u9996\u5e27\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u6761\u4ef6\u3001\u98ce\u683c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u95ea\u70c1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u9891\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u6df1\u5165\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u4e00\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u98ce\u683c\u6761\u4ef6\uff08\u6587\u672c\u3001\u98ce\u683c\u56fe\u50cf\u6216\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u9996\u5e27\uff09\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5e94\u7528\u8303\u56f4\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5bfc\u81f4\u98ce\u683c\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u95ea\u70c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6734\u7d20\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u89c6\u9891\uff08I2V\uff09\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5e26\u7279\u5b9a\u4ee4\u724c\u4e0a\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\uff08LoRA\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e0d\u540c\u6761\u4ef6\u4ee4\u724c\u95f4\u7684\u6df7\u6dc6\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u914d\u5bf9\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cDreamStyle\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u89c6\u9891\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u5728\u98ce\u683c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DreamStyle\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u98ce\u683c\u6761\u4ef6\uff0c\u914d\u5408\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u9891\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u98ce\u683c\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Although large-scale models provide effective solutions for perception and reasoning, their practical deployment on assistive devices is severely constrained by excessive memory consumption and high inference costs. Moreover, existing quantization strategies often ignore inter-block error accumulation, leading to degraded model stability. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel quantization framework -- Residual-Projected Multi-Collaboration Closed-Loop and Single Instance Quantization(RPIQ), whose quantization process adopts a multi-collaborative closed-loop compensation scheme based on Single Instance Calibration and Gauss-Seidel Iterative Quantization. Experiments on various types of large-scale models, including language models such as OPT, Qwen, and LLaMA, as well as vision-language models such as CogVLM2, demonstrate that RPIQ can compress models to 4-bit representation while significantly reducing peak memory consumption (approximately 60%-75% reduction compared to original full-precision models). The method maintains performance highly close to full-precision models across multiple language and visual tasks, and exhibits excellent recognition and reasoning capabilities in key applications such as text understanding and visual question answering in complex scenarios.

We propose a novel framework that adapts gradient ascent to LLMs, enabling targeted prompt discovery. In specific, we propose two methods, RESGA and SAEGA, that both optimize randomly initialized prompts to achieve better aligned representation with an identified persona direction. We introduce fluent gradient ascent to control the fluency of discovered persona steering prompts. We demonstrate RESGA and SAEGA's effectiveness across Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, and Gemma 3 for steering three different personas,sycophancy, hallucination, and myopic reward.

Our architecture StableDPT builds upon an off-the-shelf Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder and enhances the Dense Prediction Transformer (DPT) head. The core of our contribution lies in the temporal layers within the head, which use an efficient cross-attention mechanism to integrate information from keyframes sampled across the entire video sequence. This allows the model to capture global context and inter-frame relationships leading to more accurate and temporally stable depth predictions. Furthermore, we propose a novel inference strategy for processing videos of arbitrary length avoiding the scale misalignment and redundant computations associated with overlapping windows used in other methods.

Virtual staining converts H&E images to IHC images, offering a cost-effective alternative to clinical IHC staining. Nevertheless, using adjacent slides as ground truth often results in weakly-paired data with spatial misalignment and local deformations, hindering effective supervised learning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel topology-aware framework for H&E-to-IHC virtual staining.

In contrast, humans often employ sketch-style reasoning: a concise, goal-directed cognitive process that prioritizes salient information and enables efficient problem-solving. Inspired by this cognitive efficiency, we propose SketchThinker-R1, which incentivizes sketch-style reasoning ability in large multimodal models. Our method consists of three primary stages. In the Sketch-Mode Cold Start stage, we convert standard long reasoning process into sketch-style reasoning and finetune base multimodal model, instilling initial sketch-style reasoning capability. Next, we train SketchJudge Reward Model, which explicitly evaluates thinking process of model and assigns higher scores to sketch-style reasoning. Finally, we conduct Sketch-Thinking Reinforcement Learning under supervision of SketchJudge to further generalize sketch-style reasoning ability. Experimental evaluation on four benchmarks reveals that our SketchThinker-R1 achieves over 64% reduction in reasoning token cost without compromising final answer accuracy. Qualitative analysis further shows that sketch-style reasoning focuses more on key cues during problem solving.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faSketchThinker-R1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\u4eba\u7c7b\u8349\u56fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4etoken\u6210\u672c", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u9010\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u578b\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u9ad8\uff08token\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u54cd\u5e94\u65f6\u95f4\u957f\uff09\uff0c\u800c\u4eba\u7c7b\u4f7f\u7528\u7b80\u6d01\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u8349\u56fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09Sketch-Mode\u51b7\u542f\u52a8\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u5c06\u6807\u51c6\u957f\u63a8\u7406\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u8349\u56fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u5fae\u8c03\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff1b2\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3SketchJudge\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u8bc4\u4f30\u601d\u7ef4\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5e76\u4e3a\u8349\u56fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u5206\u914d\u66f4\u9ad8\u5206\u6570\uff1b3\uff09\u5728SketchJudge\u76d1\u7763\u4e0b\u8fdb\u884c\u8349\u56fe\u601d\u7ef4\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee5\u63a8\u5e7f\u8349\u56fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSketchThinker-R1\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5c06\u63a8\u7406token\u6210\u672c\u964d\u4f4e\u8d85\u8fc764%\uff1b\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u8349\u56fe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u5728\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u4e2d\u66f4\u5173\u6ce8\u5173\u952e\u7ebf\u7d22", "conclusion": "SketchThinker-R1\u6210\u529f\u5730\u5c06\u4eba\u7c7b\u8349\u56fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u5f15\u5165\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84"}}

Although recent DETR-based detectors benefit from global context modeling, they exhibit notable performance degradation on IRSTD. We revisit this phenomenon and reveal that the target-relevant embeddings of IRST are inevitably overwhelmed by dominant background features due to the self-attention mechanism, leading to unreliable query initialization and inaccurate target localization. To address this issue, we propose SEF-DETR, a novel framework that refines query initialization for IRSTD. Specifically, SEF-DETR consists of three components: Frequency-guided Patch Screening (FPS), Dynamic Embedding Enhancement (DEE), and Reliability-Consistency-aware Fusion (RCF). The FPS module leverages the Fourier spectrum of local patches to construct a target-relevant density map, suppressing background-dominated features. DEE strengthens multi-scale representations in a target-aware manner, while RCF further refines object queries by enforcing spatial-frequency consistency and reliability. Extensive experiments on three public IRSTD datasets demonstrate that SEF-DETR achieves superior detection performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, delivering a robust and efficient solution for infrared small target detection task.", "AI": {"tldr": "SEF-DETR\u901a\u8fc7\u9891\u7387\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u8865\u4e01\u7b5b\u9009\u3001\u52a8\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u4e86\u7ea2\u5916\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u521d\u59cb\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u76ee\u6807\u76f8\u5173\u5d4c\u5165\u88ab\u80cc\u666f\u7279\u5f81\u6df9\u6ca1\u7684\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u7ea2\u5916\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u4f4e\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u5c3a\u5bf8\u5c0f\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u590d\u6742\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684DETR\u57fa\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u867d\u7136\u53d7\u76ca\u4e8e\u5168\u5c40\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7ea2\u5916\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u76ee\u6807\u76f8\u5173\u5d4c\u5165\u88ab\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u7279\u5f81\u6df9\u6ca1\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u67e5\u8be2\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSEF-DETR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\uff1a1) \u9891\u7387\u5f15\u5bfc\u8865\u4e01\u7b5b\u9009(FPS)\uff1a\u5229\u7528\u5c40\u90e8\u8865\u4e01\u7684\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u8c31\u6784\u5efa\u76ee\u6807\u76f8\u5173\u5bc6\u5ea6\u56fe\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u80cc\u666f\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2) \u52a8\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u589e\u5f3a(DEE)\uff1a\u4ee5\u76ee\u6807\u611f\u77e5\u65b9\u5f0f\u589e\u5f3a\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8868\u793a\uff1b3) \u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u878d\u5408(RCF)\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5f3a\u5236\u7a7a\u95f4-\u9891\u7387\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u6765\u7cbe\u70bc\u5bf9\u8c61\u67e5\u8be2", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u7ea2\u5916\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSEF-DETR\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd", "conclusion": "SEF-DETR\u4e3a\u7ea2\u5916\u5c0f\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9c81\u68d2\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edfDETR\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u8be5\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u95ee\u9898"}}

We introduce SPICE, a Bayesian ICRL method that learns a prior over Q-values via deep ensemble and updates this prior at test-time using in-context information through Bayesian updates. To recover from poor priors resulting from training on sub-optimal data, our online inference follows an Upper-Confidence Bound rule that favours exploration and adaptation. We prove that SPICE achieves regret-optimal behaviour in both stochastic bandits and finite-horizon MDPs, even when pretrained only on suboptimal trajectories. We validate these findings empirically across bandit and control benchmarks. SPICE achieves near-optimal decisions on unseen tasks, substantially reduces regret compared to prior ICRL and meta-RL approaches while rapidly adapting to unseen tasks and remaining robust under distribution shift.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We present several key adaptations to diffusion models, which are important in this discrete setting. Notably, we show that a location-aware palette with our 2D gray code ordering improves performance. Adding a final tanh activation function is crucial for discrete data. On optimizing diffusion parameters, the sigmoid loss weighting consistently outperforms alternatives, regardless of the prediction type used, and we settle on x-prediction. While our current model does not yet surpass leading mask-based architectures, it narrows the performance gap and introduces unique capabilities, such as principled ambiguity modeling, that these models lack. All models were trained from scratch, and we believe that combining our proposed improvements with large-scale pretraining or promptable conditioning could lead to competitive models.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We posit that sensitive attributes (e.g., race, gender) do not merely shift data distributions but causally warp the geometry of the data manifold itself. To address this, we introduce Causal Manifold Fairness (CMF), a novel framework that bridges causal inference and geometric deep learning. CMF learns a latent representation where the local Riemannian geometry, defined by the metric tensor and curvature, remains invariant under counterfactual interventions on sensitive attributes. By enforcing constraints on the Jacobian and Hessian of the decoder, CMF ensures that the rules of the latent space (distances and shapes) are preserved across demographic groups. We validate CMF on synthetic Structural Causal Models (SCMs), demonstrating that it effectively disentangles sensitive geometric warping while preserving task utility, offering a rigorous quantification of the fairness-utility trade-off via geometric metrics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u56e0\u679c\u6d41\u5f62\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff08CMF\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u4e0e\u51e0\u4f55\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u9ece\u66fc\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5e72\u9884\u4e0d\u53d8\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5ffd\u7565\u6570\u636e\u7684\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u800c\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u4f1a\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u5730\u626d\u66f2\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u51e0\u4f55\u5c42\u9762\u786e\u4fdd\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u3002", "method": "CMF\u5b66\u4e60\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f7f\u5c40\u90e8\u9ece\u66fc\u51e0\u4f55\uff08\u5ea6\u91cf\u5f20\u91cf\u3001\u66f2\u7387\uff09\u5728\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5e72\u9884\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0d\u53d8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf9\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u7684\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u548c\u6d77\u68ee\u77e9\u9635\u65bd\u52a0\u7ea6\u675f\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8ddd\u79bb\u548c\u5f62\u72b6\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\uff0cCMF\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u8026\u654f\u611f\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u626d\u66f2\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7528\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51e0\u4f55\u6307\u6807\u91cf\u5316\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7528\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "CMF\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u63a7\u5236\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\u51e0\u4f55\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u7fa4\u4f53\u95f4\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u8868\u793a\u3002"}}

We observe non-standard activation behavior and demonstrate the difficulty to distinguish thematically similar features from one another. While SAE-based interpretability produces compelling demonstrations in selected cases, current methods often fall short of the systematic reliability required for safety-critical applications. This suggests a necessary shift in focus from prioritizing interpretability of internal representations toward reliable prediction and control of model output. Our work contributes to a more nuanced understanding of what mechanistic interpretability has achieved and highlights fundamental challenges for AI safety that remain unresolved.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9Anthropic\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u673a\u68b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u538b\u529b\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7279\u5f81\u5f15\u5bfc\u5177\u6709\u660e\u663e\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u53ef\u9760\u6027", "motivation": "\u68c0\u9a8cAnthropic\u58f0\u79f0\u7684\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4ece\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0e\u63a7\u5236\u8fd9\u4e00\u4e3b\u5f20\u3002\u8fd9\u662fAI\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u6700\u5177\u524d\u666f\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u76d1\u7763\u9014\u5f84\u4e4b\u4e00\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528Llama 3.1\u7684\u5f00\u6e90\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u590d\u5236Anthropic\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5f15\u5bfc\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6d4b\u8bd5\u7279\u5f81\u5f15\u5bfc\u5bf9\u5c42\u7ea7\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u5f15\u5bfc\u5e45\u5ea6\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027", "result": "\u6210\u529f\u590d\u5236\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u5f15\u5bfc\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u53d1\u73b0\u7279\u5f81\u5f15\u5bfc\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff1a\u5bf9\u5c42\u7ea7\u9009\u62e9\u3001\u5f15\u5bfc\u5e45\u5ea6\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u654f\u611f\uff1b\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u975e\u6807\u51c6\u6fc0\u6d3b\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u4e3b\u9898\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u5728\u9009\u5b9a\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u4e2d\u53ef\u4ea7\u751f\u6709\u8bf4\u670d\u529b\u7684\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u6240\u9700\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u53ef\u9760\u6027", "conclusion": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fd8\u4e0d\u8db3\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u91cd\u70b9\u4ece\u5185\u90e8\u8868\u793a\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u8f6c\u5411\u6a21\u578b\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u673a\u68b0\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u76ee\u524d\u8fbe\u5230\u7684\u6210\u5c31\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7ec6\u81f4\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u5e76\u7a81\u663e\u4e86AI\u5b89\u5168\u9886\u57df\u5c1a\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6311\u6218"}}

Previous methods typically focus on predicting numerical scores without explanation or provide low-level descriptions lacking precise scores. Recent reasoning-based vision language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for IQA, enabling joint generation of quality descriptions and scores. However, we notice that existing VLM-based IQA methods tend to exhibit unreliable reasoning due to their limited capability of integrating visual and textual cues. In this work, we introduce Zoom-IQA, a VLM-based IQA model to explicitly emulate key cognitive behaviors: uncertainty awareness, region reasoning, and iterative refinement. Specifically, we present a two-stage training pipeline: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our Grounded-Rationale-IQA (GR-IQA) dataset to teach the model to ground its assessments in key regions; and 2) reinforcement learning (RL) for dynamic policy exploration, primarily stabilized by our KL-Coverage regularizer to prevent reasoning and scoring diversity collapse, and supported by a Progressive Re-sampling Strategy to mitigate annotation bias. Extensive experiments show that Zoom-IQA achieves improved robustness, explainability, and generalization.

The challenges of multi-modal vehicle ReID arise from the uncertainty of modality quality distribution induced by inherent discrepancies across modalities, resulting in distinct conflicting fusion requirements for data with balanced and unbalanced quality distributions. Existing methods handle all multi-modal data within a single fusion model, overlooking the different needs of the two data types and making it difficult to decouple the conflict between intra-class consistency and inter-modal heterogeneity. To this end, we propose Disentangle Collaboration and Guidance Fusion Representations for Multi-modal Vehicle ReID (DCG-ReID). Specifically, to disentangle heterogeneous quality-distributed modal data without mutual interference, we first design the Dynamic Confidence-based Disentangling Weighting (DCDW) mechanism: dynamically reweighting three-modal contributions via interaction-derived modal confidence to build a disentangled fusion framework.

Such multi-dimensional, heterogeneous data occurs mostly in today's industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), where real-time detection of anomalies is critical to prevent impending failures and resolve them in a timely manner. However, existing anomaly detection methods often fall short of effectively coping with the complexity and dynamism of multi-dimensional data streams in IIoT. In this paper, we propose an adaptive method for detecting anomalies in IIoT streaming data utilizing a multi-source prediction model and concept drift adaptation. The proposed anomaly detection algorithm merges a prediction model into a novel drift adaptation method resulting in accurate and efficient anomaly detection that exhibits improved scalability. Our trace-driven evaluations indicate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods by achieving up to an 89.71% accuracy (in terms of Area under the Curve (AUC)) while meeting the given efficiency and scalability requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Existing VAU approaches often rely on fine-tuned multimodal large language models (MLLMs) or external modules such as video captioners, which introduce costly annotations, complex training pipelines, and high inference overhead. In this work, we introduce PrismVAU, a lightweight yet effective system for real-time VAU that leverages a single off-the-shelf MLLM for anomaly scoring, explanation, and prompt optimization. PrismVAU operates in two complementary stages: (1) a coarse anomaly scoring module that computes frame-level anomaly scores via similarity to textual anchors, and (2) an MLLM-based refinement module that contextualizes anomalies through system and user prompts. Both textual anchors and prompts are optimized with a weakly supervised Automatic Prompt Engineering (APE) framework. Extensive experiments on standard VAD benchmarks demonstrate that PrismVAU delivers competitive detection performance and interpretable anomaly explanations -- without relying on instruction tuning, frame-level annotations, and external modules or dense processing -- making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

Auditing is proposed as an accountability tool for black-box LLM applications, but suffers from resource-intensive query access. We conceptualise auditing as uncertainty estimation over a target fairness metric and introduce BAFA, the Bounded Active Fairness Auditor for query-efficient auditing of black-box LLMs. BAFA maintains a version space of surrogate models consistent with queried scores and computes uncertainty intervals for fairness metrics (e.g., $\u0394$ AUC) via constrained empirical risk minimisation. Active query selection narrows these intervals to reduce estimation error. We evaluate BAFA on two standard fairness dataset case studies: \\textsc{CivilComments} and \\textsc{Bias-in-Bios}, comparing against stratified sampling, power sampling, and ablations. BAFA achieves target error thresholds with up to 40$\\times$ fewer queries than stratified sampling (e.g., 144 vs 5,956 queries at $\\varepsilon=0.02$ for \\textsc{CivilComments}) for tight thresholds, demonstrates substantially better performance over time, and shows lower variance across runs.

Though deep learning models have excellent fault detection capabilities, almost all methods either are too large and heavy for edge computing devices or involve biased estimation of accuracy due to ineffective learning techniques. We propose a new solar panel fault detection model called HybridSolarNet. It integrates EfficientNet-B0 with Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). We implemented it on the Kaggle Solar Panel Images competition dataset with a tight split-before-augmentation protocol. It avoids leakage in accuracy estimation. We introduced focal loss and cosine annealing. Ablation analysis validates that accuracy boosts due to added benefits from CBAM (+1.53%) and that there are benefits from recognition of classes with imbalanced samples via focal loss. Overall average accuracy on 5-fold stratified cross-validation experiments on the given competition dataset topped 92.37% +/- 0.41 and an F1-score of 0.9226 +/- 0.39 compared to baselines like VGG19, requiring merely 16.3 MB storage, i.e., 32 times less. Its inference speed measured at 54.9 FPS with GPU support makes it a successful candidate for real-time UAV implementation.

However, most existing approaches rely on fixed steering policies and static intervention strengths, which limit their robustness across problem instances and often result in over- or under-steering. We propose Adaptive Test-time Latent Steering, called (ATLAS), a task- specific framework that dynamically controls steering decisions at inference time using an external, lightweight latent verifier. Given intermediate hidden states, the verifier predicts the quality of ongoing reasoning and adaptively selects whether and how strongly to apply steering, enabling per-example and per-step adjustment with minimal overhead. To our knowledge, ATLAS is the first method to integrate learned latent verification into test-time steering for enhancing LLMs reasoning. Experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that ATLAS consistently outperforms both vanilla decoding and fixed steering baselines, achieving higher accuracy while substantially reducing test-time token usage. These results demonstrate that verifier-guided latent adaptation provides an effective and scalable mechanism for controlling reasoning efficiency without sacrificing solution quality.

Previous sEMG-to-text studies mainly focused on recognizing letters directly from sEMG signals, forming an important first step toward translating muscle activity into text. Building on this foundation, we present MyoText, a hierarchical framework that decodes sEMG signals to text through physiologically grounded intermediate stages. MyoText first classifies finger activations from multichannel sEMG using a CNN-BiLSTM-Attention model, applies ergonomic typing priors to infer letters, and reconstructs full sentences with a fine-tuned T5 transformer. This modular design mirrors the natural hierarchy of typing, linking muscle intent to language output and reducing the search space for decoding. Evaluated on 30 users from the emg2qwerty dataset, MyoText outperforms baselines by achieving 85.4% finger-classification accuracy, 5.4% character error rate (CER), and 6.5% word error rate (WER). Beyond accuracy gains, this methodology establishes a principled pathway from neuromuscular signals to text, providing a blueprint for virtual and augmented-reality typing interfaces that operate entirely without physical keyboards.

This technique, Latent and Attention Mixing with Schedulers (LAMS), integrates with Prompt-to-Prompt (P2P) to form LAMS-Edit--an extensible framework that supports precise editing with region masks and enables style transfer via LoRA.

Our approach achieves superior performance to training with larger datasets across various reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that sample quality and design, rather than quantity, may be the key to unlock enhanced reasoning capabilities in language models.

Although Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting is widely used to enhance MLLM reasoning, surprisingly, its direct application to CVQA often degrades performance, especially in small-scale models. Our theoretical and empirical analyses reveal that standard CoT in CVQA suffers from state entanglement, spurious transitions, and exploration inefficiency, with small models particularly vulnerable in resource-constrained settings. To address these issues, we propose a novel comic reasoning framework, designed to produce more faithful and transferable reasoning chains in small MLLMs. Specifically, our framework combines modular CoT generation with GRPO-based reinforcement fine-tuning and a novel structured reward. Beyond comic VQA, we further evaluate our approach on a broader class of humor-centric and abstract visual reasoning tasks, including meme understanding and editorial cartoon interpretation.

Synthetic data can bridge this gap, but existing generators do not jointly achieve behavioral diversity and logical groundedness. Rule-driven simulators rely on hand-crafted workflows and shallow stochasticity, which miss the richness of human behavior. Learning-based generators such as GANs capture correlations yet often violate hard financial constraints and still require training on private data. We introduce PersonaLedger, a generation engine that uses a large language model conditioned on rich user personas to produce diverse transaction streams, coupled with an expert configurable programmatic engine that maintains correctness. The LLM and engine interact in a closed loop: after each event, the engine updates the user state, enforces financial rules, and returns a context aware \"nextprompt\" that guides the LLM toward feasible next actions.

While intermediate fusion mitigates data volume compared to raw sharing, existing frameworks typically rely on spatial compression or static confidence maps, which inefficiently transmit spatially redundant features from non-critical background regions. To address this, we propose Risk-intent Selective detection (RiSe), an interaction-aware framework that shifts the paradigm from identifying visible regions to prioritizing risk-critical ones. Specifically, we introduce a Potential Field-Trajectory Correlation Model (PTCM) grounded in potential field theory to quantitatively assess kinematic risks. Complementing this, an Intention-Driven Area Prediction Module (IDAPM) leverages ego-motion priors to proactively predict and filter key Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) areas essential for decision-making. By integrating these components, RiSe implements a semantic-selective fusion scheme that transmits high-fidelity features only from high-interaction regions, effectively acting as a feature denoiser. Extensive experiments on the DeepAccident dataset demonstrate that our method reduces communication volume to 0.71\\% of full feature sharing while maintaining state-of-the-art detection accuracy, establishing a competitive Pareto frontier between bandwidth efficiency and perception performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRiSe\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u98ce\u9669\u610f\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f66\u8def\u534f\u540c\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u4ec5\u4f20\u8f93\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4ea4\u4e92\u533a\u57df\u7684\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5c06\u901a\u4fe1\u91cf\u964d\u81f3\u5168\u7279\u5f81\u5171\u4eab\u76840.71%\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6700\u4f18\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8f66\u8def\u534f\u540c\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e2d\u7ea7\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u91cf\uff0c\u4f46\u4ecd\u4f1a\u4f20\u8f93\u80cc\u666f\u533a\u57df\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u5197\u4f59\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u901a\u4fe1\u5e26\u5bbd\u4e0e\u7279\u5f81\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u6743\u8861\u4f9d\u7136\u662f\u5173\u952e\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRisk-intent Selective detection (RiSe)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\uff1a1) \u57fa\u4e8e\u52bf\u573a\u7406\u8bba\u7684PTCM\u6a21\u578b\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd0\u52a8\u98ce\u9669\uff1b2) \u5229\u7528\u81ea\u8f66\u8fd0\u52a8\u5148\u9a8c\u7684IDAPM\u6a21\u5757\u9884\u6d4b\u5173\u952eBEV\u533a\u57df\uff1b\u4e8c\u8005\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f20\u8f93\u9ad8\u4ea4\u4e92\u533a\u57df\u7684\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "result": "\u5728DeepAccident\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u5c06\u901a\u4fe1\u91cf\u964d\u81f3\u5168\u7279\u5f81\u5171\u4eab\u76840.71%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u5e26\u5bbd\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u4e4b\u95f4\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u524d\u6cbf\u3002", "conclusion": "RiSe\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u89c1\u533a\u57df\u8f6c\u5411\u4f18\u5148\u5173\u6ce8\u98ce\u9669\u5173\u952e\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u8f66\u8def\u534f\u540c\u611f\u77e5\u4e2d\u901a\u4fe1\u5e26\u5bbd\u4e0e\u611f\u77e5\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In particular, decision-makers need to understand what causes generative AI systems to exhibit specific output characteristics. Within this general topic, this paper examines a key question: what is it about the input -the prompt- that causes an LLM-based generative AI system to produce output that exhibits specific characteristics, such as toxicity, negative sentiment, or political bias. To examine this question, we adapt a common technique from the Explainable AI literature: counterfactual explanations. We explain why traditional counterfactual explanations cannot be applied directly to generative AI systems, due to several differences in how generative AI systems function. We then propose a flexible framework that adapts counterfactual explanations to non-deterministic, generative AI systems in scenarios where downstream classifiers can reveal key characteristics of their outputs. Based on this framework, we introduce an algorithm for generating prompt-counterfactual explanations (PCEs). Finally, we demonstrate the production of counterfactual explanations for generative AI systems with three case studies, examining different output characteristics (viz., political leaning, toxicity, and sentiment). The case studies further show that PCEs can streamline prompt engineering to suppress undesirable output characteristics and can enhance red-teaming efforts to uncover additional prompts that elicit undesirable outputs. Ultimately, this work lays a foundation for prompt-focused interpretability in generative AI: a capability that will become indispensable as these models are entrusted with higher-stakes tasks and subject to emerging regulatory requirements for transparency and accountability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u8f93\u51fa\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u6027\uff08\u5982\u6bd2\u6027\u3001\u8d1f\u9762\u60c5\u7eea\u6216\u653f\u6cbb\u504f\u89c1\uff09\u539f\u56e0\u7684**prompt-counterfactual explanations (PCEs)** \u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u4e09\u79cd\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u548c\u589e\u5f3a\u7ea2\u961f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u5e7f\u6cdb\uff0c\u7ec4\u7ec7\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u51b3\u7b56\u8005\u9700\u8981\u4e86\u89e3\u8f93\u5165\uff08\u5373prompt\uff09\u5982\u4f55\u5bfc\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u4ea7\u751f\u5177\u6709\u7279\u5b9a\u8f93\u51fa\u7279\u6027\uff08\u5982\u6bd2\u6027\u3001\u8d1f\u9762\u60c5\u7eea\u6216\u653f\u6cbb\u504f\u89c1\uff09\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3002\u7136\u800c\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u9488\u5bf9\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587**\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7075\u6d3b\u6846\u67b6**\uff0c\u5c06\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u9002\u5e94\u4e8e\u975e\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u9996\u5148\u5206\u6790\u4f20\u7edf\u53cd\u4e8b\u5b9e\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u80fd\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5177\u6709\u4e0b\u6e38\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u7684\u751f\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6b64\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a**\u8bbe\u8ba1PCEs\u751f\u6210\u7b97\u6cd5**\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff08\u653f\u6cbb\u503e\u5411\u3001\u6bd2\u6027\u548c\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\uff09\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660ePCEs\u80fd\u591f\uff1a\n1. \u534f\u52a9\u5206\u6790prompt\u4e2d\u54ea\u4e9b\u5143\u7d20\u5bfc\u81f4\u7279\u5b9a\u8f93\u51fa\u7279\u6027\uff1b\n2. \u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u4e0d\u826f\u8f93\u51fa\u7279\u6027\uff1b\n3. \u589e\u5f3a\u7ea2\u961f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4ee5\u53d1\u73b0\u66f4\u591a\u89e6\u53d1\u4e0d\u826f\u8f93\u51fa\u7684prompt\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u9879\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u4e2d\u805a\u7126prompt\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u968f\u7740\u6a21\u578b\u627f\u62c5\u66f4\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u9762\u4e34\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u8d23\u4efb\u6cd5\u89c4\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u6b64\u7c7b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u80fd\u529b\u5c06\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u53ef\u6216\u7f3a\u3002PCEs\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5b9e\u73b0\u8fd9\u4e00\u76ee\u6807\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

We present ReCCur (Recursive Corner-Case Curation), a low-compute framework that converts noisy web imagery into auditable fine-grained labels via a multi-agent recursive pipeline. First, large-scale data acquisition and filtering expands a domain vocabulary with a vision-language model (VLM), crawls the web, and enforces tri-modal (image, description, keyword) consistency with light human spot checks to yield refined candidates. Next, mixture-of-experts knowledge distillation uses complementary encoders (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2, BEiT) for kNN voting with dual-confidence activation and uncertainty sampling, converging to a high-precision set.

SA-ResGS improves both the reliability of uncertainty estimates and their effectiveness for supervision by generating Self-Augmented point clouds (SA-Points) via triangulation between a training view and a rasterized extrapolated view, enabling efficient scene coverage estimation. While improving scene coverage through physically guided view selection, SA-ResGS also addresses the challenge of under-supervised Gaussians, exacerbated by sparse and wide-baseline views, by introducing the first residual learning strategy tailored for 3D Gaussian Splatting. This targeted supervision enhances gradient flow in high-uncertainty Gaussians by combining uncertainty-driven filtering with dropout- and hard-negative-mining-inspired sampling. Our contributions are threefold: (1) a physically grounded view selection strategy that promotes efficient and uniform scene coverage; (2) an uncertainty-aware residual supervision scheme that amplifies learning signals for weakly contributing Gaussians, improving training stability and uncertainty estimation across scenes with diverse camera distributions; (3) an implicit unbiasing of uncertainty quantification as a consequence of constrained view selection and residual supervision, which together mitigate conflicting effects of wide-baseline exploration and sparse-view ambiguity in NBV planning.

In these frameworks, a reverse generative process reconstructs physical fields from standard Gaussian noise conditioned on unseen geometries. The proposed approaches operate directly on point-cloud representations of computational domains (e.g., grid vertices of finite-volume meshes) and therefore avoid the limitations of pixelation used to project geometries onto uniform lattices. In contrast to graph neural network-based diffusion models, Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet do not exhibit high-frequency noise artifacts in the predicted fields. Moreover, unlike such approaches, which require auxiliary intermediate networks to condition geometry, the proposed frameworks rely solely on PointNet, resulting in a simple and unified architecture. The performance of the proposed frameworks is evaluated on steady incompressible flow past a cylinder, using a geometric dataset constructed by varying the cylinder's cross-sectional shape and orientation across samples. The results demonstrate that Flow Matching PointNet and Diffusion PointNet achieve more accurate predictions of velocity and pressure fields, as well as lift and drag forces, and exhibit greater robustness to incomplete geometries compared to a vanilla PointNet with the same number of trainable parameters.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

In practice, this requires trading off multiple, often competing, objectives through multi-objective optimization (MOO). However, existing MOO methods typically treat all hyperparameters as equally important, overlooking that hyperparameter importance (HPI) can vary significantly depending on the trade-off between objectives. We propose a novel dynamic optimization approach that prioritizes the most influential hyperparameters based on varying objective trade-offs during the search process, which accelerates empirical convergence and leads to better solutions. Building on prior work on HPI for MOO post-analysis, we now integrate HPI, calculated with HyperSHAP, into the optimization. For this, we leverage the objective weightings naturally produced by the MOO algorithm ParEGO and adapt the configuration space by fixing the unimportant hyperparameters, allowing the search to focus on the important ones.

Existing approaches either suppress blur as noise and lose discriminative structure, or apply full image restoration that increases latency and limits deployment on resource constrained devices. We propose DFRCP, a Dynamic Fuzzy Robust Convolutional Pyramid, as a plug in upgrade to YOLOv11 for blur robust detection. DFRCP enhances the YOLOv11 feature pyramid by combining large scale and medium scale features while preserving native representations, and by introducing Dynamic Robust Switch units that adaptively inject fuzzy features to strengthen global perception under jitter. Fuzzy features are synthesized by rotating and nonlinearly interpolating multiscale features, then merged through a transparency convolution that learns a content adaptive trade off between original and fuzzy cues.

We present a large-scale dataset of 129,000+ labeled multivariate time-series sequences from 153 rides by 51 participants under No, Low, and High Time Pressure conditions. Each sequence captures 63 features spanning vehicle kinematics, control inputs, behavioral violations, and environmental context. Our empirical analysis shows High Time Pressure induces 48% higher speeds, 36.4% greater speed variability, 58% more risky turns at intersections, 36% more sudden braking, and 50% higher rear brake forces versus No Time Pressure. To benchmark this dataset, we propose MotoTimePressure, a deep learning model combining convolutional preprocessing, dual-stage temporal attention, and Squeeze-and-Excitation feature recalibration, achieving 91.53% accuracy and 98.93% ROC AUC, outperforming eight baselines. Since time pressure cannot be directly measured in real time, we demonstrate its utility in collision prediction and threshold determination. Using MTPS-predicted time pressure as features, improves Informer-based collision risk accuracy from 91.25% to 93.51%, approaching oracle performance (93.72%). Thresholded time pressure states capture rider cognitive stress and enable proactive ITS interventions, including adaptive alerts, haptic feedback, V2I signaling, and speed guidance, supporting safer two-wheeler mobility under the Safe System Approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We demonstrate that for non-solvable groups (e.g., the 3D rotation group $\\mathrm{SO}(3)$), maintaining such a structure-preserving embedding is computationally lower-bounded by the Word Problem, which is $\\mathsf{NC^1}$-complete. In contrast, we prove that constant-depth ViTs with polynomial precision are strictly bounded by $\\mathsf{TC^0}$. Under the conjecture $\\mathsf{TC^0} \\subsetneq \\mathsf{NC^1}$, we establish a complexity boundary: constant-depth ViTs fundamentally lack the logical depth to efficiently capture non-solvable spatial structures.

Although segmentation serves as the foundation for pixel-level understanding, existing approaches face two major challenges. First, they introduce implicit segmentation tokens and require simultaneous fine-tuning of both the MLLM and external pixel decoders, which increases the risk of catastrophic forgetting and limits generalization to out-of-domain scenarios. Second, most methods rely on single-pass reasoning and lack the capability to iteratively refine segmentation results, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel agentic MLLM, named IBISAgent, that reformulates segmentation as a vision-centric, multi-step decision-making process. IBISAgent enables MLLMs to generate interleaved reasoning and text-based click actions, invoke segmentation tools, and produce high-quality masks without architectural modifications. By iteratively performing multi-step visual reasoning on masked image features, IBISAgent naturally supports mask refinement and promotes the development of pixel-level visual reasoning capabilities. We further design a two-stage training framework consisting of cold-start supervised fine-tuning and agentic reinforcement learning with tailored, fine-grained rewards, enhancing the model's robustness in complex medical referring and reasoning segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IBISAgent consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source SOTA methods.

While the equivalence $p^{1/T} \\propto \\mathrm{softmax}(z/T)$ is well known, our contribution is an operator-level analytical framework built on this foundation rather than the equivalence itself.\n  The framework comprises four core components: (i) operator-agnostic bias--variance decompositions that characterize when sparse students outperform dense teachers, (ii) a homotopy path formalization of multi-stage pruning in function space explaining why iterative compression succeeds where one-shot pruning fails, (iii) convergence guarantees establishing $O(1/n)$ rates for $n$-stage distillation with explicit parameter dependence, and (iv) equivalence class characterizations identifying distinct probability-domain operators that yield identical student models under capacity constraints.\n  We introduce an axiomatic definition of probability-domain softening operators based on ranking preservation, continuity, entropy monotonicity, identity, and boundary behavior, and show that multiple non-equivalent operator families satisfy these axioms. All learning-theoretic guarantees are shown to hold uniformly across this operator class, independent of implementation details. These results provide theoretical grounding for black-box teacher distillation, partial-access settings such as top-$k$ truncation and text-only outputs, and privacy-preserving model compression.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u57df\u8f6f\u5316\u7b97\u5b50\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7edf\u4e00\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u504f\u5dee\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u3001\u540c\u4f26\u8def\u5f84\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u3001\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\u548c\u7b49\u4ef7\u7c7b\u7279\u5f81\u56db\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u7a00\u758f\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4f55\u65f6\u80fd\u8d85\u8d8a\u5bc6\u96c6\u6559\u5e08\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u4fee\u526a\u4e3a\u4f55\u6bd4\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u538b\u7f29\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5efa\u7acb\u4e00\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "1. \u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u5e8f\u4fdd\u6301\u3001\u8fde\u7eed\u6027\u3001\u71b5\u5355\u8c03\u6027\u3001\u6052\u7b49\u6027\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u6982\u7387\u57df\u8f6f\u5316\u7b97\u5b50\u516c\u7406\u5b9a\u4e49\n2. \u5efa\u7acb\u7b97\u5b50\u4e0d\u53ef\u77e5\u7684\u504f\u5dee-\u65b9\u5dee\u5206\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\n3. \u5728\u51fd\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u4fee\u526a\u7684\u540c\u4f26\u8def\u5f84\n4. \u63a8\u5bfc\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u6536\u655b\u6027\u4fdd\u8bc1\n5. \u8bc6\u522b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5bb9\u91cf\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u4ea7\u751f\u76f8\u540c\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6982\u7387\u57df\u7b97\u5b50\u7b49\u4ef7\u7c7b", "result": "1. \u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u591a\u4e2a\u6ee1\u8db3\u516c\u7406\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u975e\u7b49\u4ef7\u7b97\u5b50\u5bb6\u65cf\n2. \u8bc1\u660e\u6240\u6709\u5b66\u4e60\u7406\u8bba\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5728\u8be5\u7b97\u5b50\u7c7b\u4e2d\u662f\u5747\u5300\u6210\u7acb\u7684\n3. \u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86O(1/n)\u7684n\u9636\u6bb5\u84b8\u998f\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5177\u6709\u663e\u5f0f\u53c2\u6570\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\n4. \u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\u6559\u5e08\u84b8\u998f\u3001\u90e8\u5206\u8bbf\u95ee\u8bbe\u7f6e\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u6a21\u578b\u538b\u7f29\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u4f9d\u636e", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7a00\u758f\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u91ca\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u4fee\u526a\u7684\u6210\u529f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5404\u79cd\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u652f\u6301\uff0c\u4e14\u6240\u6709\u7406\u8bba\u7ed3\u679c\u72ec\u7acb\u4e8e\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ec6\u8282\u3002"}}

Under domain shifts, the model becomes overly sensitive to fine-grained cues, leading to the suppression of critical features and a significant drop in performance. Cognitive studies suggest that humans classify objects by leveraging both common and specific attributes, enabling accurate differentiation between fine-grained categories. However, current deep learning models have yet to incorporate this mechanism effectively. Inspired by this mechanism, we propose Concept-Feature Structuralized Generalization (CFSG). This model explicitly disentangles both the concept and feature spaces into three structured components: common, specific, and confounding segments. To mitigate the adverse effects of varying degrees of distribution shift, we introduce an adaptive mechanism that dynamically adjusts the proportions of common, specific, and confounding components. In the final prediction, explicit weights are assigned to each pair of components. Extensive experiments on three single-source benchmark datasets demonstrate that CFSG achieves an average performance improvement of 9.87% over baseline models and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by an average of 3.08%. Additionally, explainability analysis validates that CFSG effectively integrates multi-granularity structured knowledge and confirms that feature structuralization facilitates the emergence of concept structuralization.", "AI": {"tldr": "TLDR: \u8fd9\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5-\u7279\u5f81\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6cdb\u5316\uff08CFSG\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u663e\u5f0f\u89e3\u8026\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u8c03\u6574\u7ec4\u4ef6\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5355\u6e90\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u53479.87%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709SOTA\u65b9\u6cd53.08%\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\uff08FGDG\uff09\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u66f4\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5fae\u5c0f\u7684\u7c7b\u95f4\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u76f8\u5bf9\u660e\u663e\u7684\u7c7b\u5185\u53d8\u5316\u3002\u5728\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ebf\u7d22\u8fc7\u4e8e\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u53d7\u5230\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u5171\u540c\u548c\u7279\u5b9a\u5c5e\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5-\u7279\u5f81\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6cdb\u5316\uff08CFSG\uff09\u6a21\u578b\uff1a1\uff09\u663e\u5f0f\u5c06\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u5171\u540c\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u548c\u6df7\u6dc6\u6bb5\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u5171\u540c\u3001\u7279\u5b9a\u548c\u6df7\u6dc6\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u4e0d\u540c\u7a0b\u5ea6\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u504f\u79fb\u5f71\u54cd\uff1b3\uff09\u5728\u6700\u7ec8\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u4e3a\u6bcf\u5bf9\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5206\u914d\u663e\u5f0f\u6743\u91cd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5355\u6e90\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff1a1\uff09CFSG\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u53479.87%\uff1b2\uff09\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u57473.08%\uff1b3\uff09\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86CFSG\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\uff1b4\uff09\u7279\u5f81\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u6982\u5ff5\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u51fa\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "CFSG\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89e3\u8026\u6982\u5ff5\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u673a\u5236\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u7b56\u7565\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u57df\u504f\u79fb\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Nevertheless, existing benchmarks for evaluating MLLMs' instruction-following capability primarily focus on verbal instructions in the textual modality. These limitations hinder a thorough analysis of instruction-following capabilities, as they overlook the implicit constraints embedded in the semantically rich visual modality. To address this gap, we introduce VC-IFEval, a new benchmark accompanied by a systematically constructed dataset that evaluates MLLMs' instruction-following ability under multimodal settings. Our benchmark systematically incorporates vision-dependent constraints into instruction design, enabling a more rigorous and fine-grained assessment of how well MLLMs align their outputs with both visual input and textual instructions. Furthermore, by fine-tuning MLLMs on our dataset, we achieve substantial gains in visual instruction-following accuracy and adherence.

Prior diffusion unlearning methods typically rely on supervised weight edits or global penalties; reinforcement-learning (RL) approaches, while flexible, often optimize sparse end-of-trajectory rewards, yielding high-variance updates and weak credit assignment. We present a general RL framework for diffusion unlearning that treats denoising as a sequential decision process and introduces a timestep-aware critic with noisy-step rewards. Concretely, we train a CLIP-based reward predictor on noisy latents and use its per-step signal to compute advantage estimates for policy-gradient updates of the reverse diffusion kernel. Our algorithm is simple to implement, supports off-policy reuse, and plugs into standard text-to-image backbones. Across multiple concepts, the method achieves better or comparable forgetting to strong baselines while maintaining image quality and benign prompt fidelity; ablations show that (i) per-step critics and (ii) noisy-conditioned rewards are key to stability and effectiveness.

MLLMs still suffer from visually ungrounded hallucinations, often relying on language priors rather than image evidence. While many prior mitigation strategies operate on the text side, they leave the visual representation unchanged and do not exploit the rich hierarchy of features encoded across vision layers. Existing multi-layer fusion methods partially address this limitation but remain static, applying the same layer mixture regardless of the query. In this work, we introduce TGIF (Text-Guided Inter-layer Fusion), a lightweight module that treats encoder layers as depth-wise \"experts\" and predicts a prompt-dependent fusion of visual features. TGIF follows the principle of direct external fusion, requires no vision-encoder updates, and adds minimal overhead. Integrated into LLaVA-1.5-7B, TGIF provides consistent improvements across hallucination, OCR, and VQA benchmarks, while preserving or improving performance on ScienceQA, GQA, and MMBench.

Can new and useful information be constructed from merely applying deterministic transformations to existing data? Can the learnable content in data be evaluated without considering a downstream task? On these questions, Shannon information and Kolmogorov complexity come up nearly empty-handed, in part because they assume observers with unlimited computational capacity and fail to target the useful information content. In this work, we identify and exemplify three seeming paradoxes in information theory: (1) information cannot be increased by deterministic transformations; (2) information is independent of the order of data; (3) likelihood modeling is merely distribution matching. To shed light on the tension between these results and modern practice, and to quantify the value of data, we introduce epiplexity, a formalization of information capturing what computationally bounded observers can learn from data. Epiplexity captures the structural content in data while excluding time-bounded entropy, the random unpredictable content exemplified by pseudorandom number generators and chaotic dynamical systems. With these concepts, we demonstrate how information can be created with computation, how it depends on the ordering of the data, and how likelihood modeling can produce more complex programs than present in the data generating process itself. We also present practical procedures to estimate epiplexity which we show capture differences across data sources, track with downstream performance, and highlight dataset interventions that improve out-of-distribution generalization. In contrast to principles of model selection, epiplexity provides a theoretical foundation for data selection, guiding how to select, generate, or transform data for learning systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "Summary generation failed", "motivation": "Motivation analysis unavailable", "method": "Method extraction failed", "result": "Result analysis unavailable", "conclusion": "Conclusion extraction failed"}}

We argue that closing this gap requires not merely better visual generators, but executable reasoning: decomposing high-level intents into grounded, verifiable plans that directly steer the generative process. To this end, we propose Unified Thinker, a task-agnostic reasoning architecture for general image generation, designed as a unified planning core that can plug into diverse generators and workflows. Unified Thinker decouples a dedicated Thinker from the image Generator, enabling modular upgrades of reasoning without retraining the entire generative model.

To address this, we propose UniCorn, a simple yet elegant self-improvement framework that eliminates the need for external data or teacher supervision. By partitioning a single UMM into three collaborative roles: Proposer, Solver, and Judge, UniCorn generates high-quality interactions via self-play and employs cognitive pattern reconstruction to distill latent understanding into explicit generative signals. To validate the restoration of multimodal coherence, we introduce UniCycle, a cycle-consistency benchmark based on a Text to Image to Text reconstruction loop.

LTX-2 consists of an asymmetric dual-stream transformer with a 14B-parameter video stream and a 5B-parameter audio stream, coupled through bidirectional audio-video cross-attention layers with temporal positional embeddings and cross-modality AdaLN for shared timestep conditioning. This architecture enables efficient training and inference of a unified audiovisual model while allocating more capacity for video generation than audio generation. We employ a multilingual text encoder for broader prompt understanding and introduce a modality-aware classifier-free guidance (modality-CFG) mechanism for improved audiovisual alignment and controllability. Beyond generating speech, LTX-2 produces rich, coherent audio tracks that follow the characters, environment, style, and emotion of each scene -- complete with natural background and foley elements. In our evaluations, the model achieves state-of-the-art audiovisual quality and prompt adherence among open-source systems, while delivering results comparable to proprietary models at a fraction of their computational cost and inference time.

However, due to the limitations of current AIGC models, most models can only serve as individual components within specific application scenarios and are not capable of completing tasks end-to-end in real-world applications. In real-world applications, editing experts often work with a wide variety of images and video inputs, producing multimodal outputs -- a video typically includes audio, text, and other elements. This level of integration across multiple modalities is something current models are unable to achieve effectively. However, the rise of agent-based systems has made it possible to use AI tools to tackle complex content generation tasks. To deal with the complex scenarios, in this paper, we propose a MultiMedia-Agent designed to automate complex content creation. Our agent system includes a data generation pipeline, a tool library for content creation, and a set of metrics for evaluating preference alignment. Notably, we introduce the skill acquisition theory to model the training data curation and agent training. We designed a two-stage correlation strategy for plan optimization, including self-correlation and model preference correlation. Additionally, we utilized the generated plans to train the MultiMedia-Agent via a three stage approach including base/success plan finetune and preference optimization. The comparison results demonstrate that the our approaches are effective and the MultiMedia-Agent can generate better multimedia content compared to novel models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u591a\u5a92\u4f53\u521b\u4f5c\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u89c4\u5212\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7684AIGC\u6a21\u578b\u591a\u4e3a\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u4e13\u7528\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5b8c\u6210\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u591a\u5a92\u4f53\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u73b0\u5b9e\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u8f93\u51fa\uff08\u89c6\u9891\u542b\u97f3\u9891\u3001\u6587\u672c\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u800c\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5305\u542b\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u3001\u521b\u4f5c\u5de5\u5177\u5e93\u548c\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u7684\u591a\u5a92\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u6280\u80fd\u4e60\u5f97\u7406\u8bba\u5efa\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u7b56\u5212\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u89c4\u5212\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\uff08\u81ea\u5173\u8054\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u504f\u597d\u5173\u8054\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u57fa\u7840/\u6210\u529f\u8ba1\u5212\u5fae\u8c03+\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002", "result": "\u6bd4\u8f83\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u591a\u5a92\u4f53\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u4f18\u4e8e\u65b0\u9896\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u5a92\u4f53\u5185\u5bb9\u521b\u4f5c\u7684\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6574\u5408\u65b9\u9762\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

Previous methods, which rely on part-aware optimization, manual assembly, or 2D image generation, often produce unrealistic or incoherent 3D assets due to the challenges of intricate part-level manipulation and limited out-of-domain generation. In contrast, Muses leverages the 3D skeleton, a fundamental representation of biological forms, to explicitly and rationally compose diverse elements. This skeletal foundation formalizes 3D content creation as a structure-aware pipeline of design, composition, and generation. Muses begins by constructing a creatively composed 3D skeleton with coherent layout and scale through graph-constrained reasoning. This skeleton then guides a voxel-based assembly process within a structured latent space, integrating regions from different objects. Finally, image-guided appearance modeling under skeletal conditions is applied to generate a style-consistent and harmonious texture for the assembled shape.
