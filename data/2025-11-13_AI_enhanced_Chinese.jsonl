However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Our work demonstrates that principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware.

TabPFN-2.5 is now the leading method for the industry standard benchmark TabArena (which contains datasets with up to 100,000 training data points), substantially outperforming tuned tree-based models and matching the accuracy of AutoGluon 1.4, a complex four-hour tuned ensemble that even includes the previous TabPFNv2. Remarkably, default TabPFN-2.5 has a 100% win rate against default XGBoost on small to medium-sized classification datasets (<=10,000 data points, 500 features) and a 87% win rate on larger datasets up to 100K samples and 2K features (85% for regression). For production use cases, we introduce a new distillation engine that converts TabPFN-2.5 into a compact MLP or tree ensemble, preserving most of its accuracy while delivering orders-of-magnitude lower latency and plug-and-play deployment.

This is the context in which the Generative Artificial Intelligence models described in this paper are positioned, developed by Engineering Ingegneria Informatica SpA in order to automate the plant structures acquisition of SNAM energy infrastructure, a leading gas transportation company in Italy and Europe. The digitization of a gas plant consists in registering all its relevant information through the interpretation of the related documentation. The aim of this work is therefore to design an effective solution based on Artificial Intelligence techniques to automate the extraction of the information necessary for the digitization of a plant, in order to streamline the daily work of MGM users. The solution received the P&ID of the plant as input, each one in pdf format, and uses OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms to return an output consisting of two sets of information: a structured overview of the relevant design data and the hierarchical framework of the plant. To achieve convincing results, we extend a state-of-the-art model for Scene Graph Generation introducing a brand new Transformer architecture with the aim of deepening the analysis of the complex relations between the plant's components.

It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts. The AMR graphs are then parsed from simplified language and used to generate ASP constraints systematically. The system successfully creates an entire ASP program that solves a combinatorial logic problem. This approach is a significant first step in creating a lighter-weight, explainable system that converts natural language to solve complex logic problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c06\u65e0\u9650\u5236\u82f1\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6210ASP\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u548cAMR\u56fe\u6765\u5904\u7406\u903b\u8f91\u62fc\u56fe\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u7684ASP\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u7ec4\u5408\u903b\u8f91\u95ee\u9898", "motivation": "\u8ba9\u4e0d\u61c2\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u7528\u6237\u80fd\u591f\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7801\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u95ee\u9898", "method": "\u7ed3\u5408LLM\u548cAMR\u56fe\uff1aLLM\u8d1f\u8d23\u7b80\u5316\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u53e5\u5b50\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u548c\u751f\u6210\u7b80\u5355\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff1bAMR\u56fe\u4ece\u7b80\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u6790\u5e76\u7cfb\u7edf\u751f\u6210ASP\u7ea6\u675f\u6761\u4ef6", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u529f\u751f\u6210\u4e86\u80fd\u591f\u89e3\u51b3\u7ec4\u5408\u903b\u8f91\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u5b8c\u6574ASP\u7a0b\u5e8f", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u662f\u521b\u5efa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8f6c\u6362\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u590d\u6742\u903b\u8f91\u95ee\u9898\u7684ASP\u7a0b\u5e8f"}}

To fully exploit the complementarity of hierarchical knowledge within LoRAs, we introduce HL-Attn, a hierarchical fusion module that integrates multi-scale features while maintaining their distinct characteristics.

Experimental results on the Synapse, LA, and PROMISE12 datasets demonstrate that SAMora outperforms existing SAM variants.

However, this mechanism can introduce lip leaking, where generated lips are influenced by the reference image rather than solely by the driving audio. Such leakage is difficult to detect with standard metrics and conventional test setup. To address this, we propose a systematic evaluation methodology to analyze and quantify lip leakage. Our framework employs three complementary test setups: silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis. We also introduce derived metrics including lip-sync discrepancy and silent-audio-based lip-sync scores.

Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). Our solver works by object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary results indicate success, with our solver scoring 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost.

Over larger-yet still constant-sized-fields, algebraic-geometry codes are known to beat the GV bound. In this work, we leverage this phenomenon by taking traces of AG codes. Our hope is that the margin by which AG codes exceed the GV bound will withstand the parameter loss incurred by taking the trace from a constant field extension to the binary field. In contrast to concatenation, the usual alphabet-reduction method, our analysis of trace-of-AG (TAG) codes uses the AG codes' algebraic structure throughout - including in the alphabet-reduction step.\n  Our main technical contribution is a Hasse-Weil-type theorem that is well-suited for the analysis of TAG codes. The classical theorem (and its Grothendieck trace-formula extension) are inadequate in this setting. Although we do not obtain improved constructions, we show that a constant-factor strengthening of our bound would suffice. We also analyze the limitations of TAG codes under our bound and prove that, in the high-distance regime, they are inferior to code concatenation. Our Hasse-Weil-type theorem holds in far greater generality than is needed for analyzing TAG codes.

However, a key challenge is to simultaneously compress inter-modal redundancy and improve semantic reliability under channel distortion. To address the challenge, we propose a robust and efficient multi-modal task-oriented communication framework that integrates a two-stage variational information bottleneck (VIB) with mutual information (MI) redundancy minimization. In the first stage, we apply uni-modal VIB to compress each modality separately, i.e., text, audio, and video, while preserving task-specific features. To enhance efficiency, an MI minimization module with adversarial training is then used to suppress cross-modal dependencies and to promote complementarity rather than redundancy. In the second stage, a multi-modal VIB is further used to compress the fused representation and to enhance robustness against channel distortion. Experimental results on multi-modal emotion recognition tasks demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms existing baselines in accuracy and reliability, particularly under low signal-to-noise ratio regimes.

This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\\sim$90\\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\\sim$80\\% of trajectories under challenging conditions. Transfer learning experiments reveal strong generalization capabilities, with the pretrained model achieving much higher detection and tracking accuracy performance compared to training the model from scratch. Additionally, systematic camera dropout experiments reveal graceful performance degradation, demonstrating practical robustness for real-world deployments where camera failures may occur.

A game-based coupled migration framework characterized by antisymmetric matrices is first established to facilitate the coordination of cross-regional resource allocation between VPPs. To address the challenge posed to conventional probabilistic modeling by the inherent data sparsity of DC workloads, deterministic equivalent transformations of fuzzy chance constraints are derived based on fuzzy set theory, and non-convex stochastic problems are transformed into a solvable second-order cone program. To address the multi-player interest coordination problem in cooperative games, an improved Shapley value profit allocation method with the VPP operator as intermediary is proposed to achieve a balance between theoretical fairness and computational feasibility. In addition, the alternating direction method of multipliers with consensus-based variable splitting is introduced to solve the high-dimensional non-convex optimization problem, transforming coupled antisymmetric constraints into separable subproblems with analytical solutions.

On LLM Agent Behavior in Dictator Games", "comment": "7 pages, 2 figures, v1 init", "summary": "In behavioral sciences, experiments such as the ultimatum game are conducted to assess preferences for fairness or self-interest of study participants. In the dictator game, a simplified version of the ultimatum game where only one of two players makes a single decision, the dictator unilaterally decides how to split a fixed sum of money between themselves and the other player. Although recent studies have explored behavioral patterns of AI agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) instructed to adopt different personas, we question the robustness of these results. In particular, many of these studies overlook the role of the system prompt - the underlying instructions that shape the model's behavior - and do not account for how sensitive results can be to slight changes in prompts. However, a robust baseline is essential when studying highly complex behavioral aspects of LLMs. To overcome previous limitations, we propose the LLM agent behavior study (LLM-ABS) framework to (i) explore how different system prompts influence model behavior, (ii) get more reliable insights into agent preferences by using neutral prompt variations, and (iii) analyze linguistic features in responses to open-ended instructions by LLM agents to better understand the reasoning behind their behavior. We found that agents often exhibit a strong preference for fairness, as well as a significant impact of the system prompt on their behavior.

In this study, we propose a novel feature extraction method using persistent homology to analyze structural MRI of the brain. This approach converts topological features into powerful feature vectors through Betti functions. By integrating these feature vectors with a simple machine learning model like XGBoost, we achieve a computationally efficient machine learning model. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models in both binary and three-class classification tasks for ADNI 3D MRI disease diagnosis. Using 10-fold cross-validation, our model achieved an average accuracy of 97.43 percent and sensitivity of 99.09 percent for binary classification. For three-class classification, it achieved an average accuracy of 95.47 percent and sensitivity of 94.98 percent. Unlike many deep learning models, our approach does not require data augmentation or extensive preprocessing, making it particularly suitable for smaller datasets.

Prior methods for motion-conditioned synthesis typically require model-specific fine-tuning, which is computationally expensive and restrictive. We introduce Time-to-Move (TTM), a training-free, plug-and-play framework for motion- and appearance-controlled video generation with image-to-video (I2V) diffusion models. Our key insight is to use crude reference animations obtained through user-friendly manipulations such as cut-and-drag or depth-based reprojection. Motivated by SDEdit's use of coarse layout cues for image editing, we treat the crude animations as coarse motion cues and adapt the mechanism to the video domain. We preserve appearance with image conditioning and introduce dual-clock denoising, a region-dependent strategy that enforces strong alignment in motion-specified regions while allowing flexibility elsewhere, balancing fidelity to user intent with natural dynamics. This lightweight modification of the sampling process incurs no additional training or runtime cost and is compatible with any backbone. Extensive experiments on object and camera motion benchmarks show that TTM matches or exceeds existing training-based baselines in realism and motion control. Beyond this, TTM introduces a unique capability: precise appearance control through pixel-level conditioning, exceeding the limits of text-only prompting.

Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone.

Recently, autoencoder (AE) based approaches have gained attention for the end-to-end design of communication systems, offering a data driven alternative to conventional coding schemes. However, enforcing binary codewords within differentiable AE architectures remains difficult, as discretization breaks gradient flow and often leads to unstable convergence. To overcome this limitation, a simplified two stage training procedure is proposed, consisting of a continuous pretraining phase followed by direct binarization and fine tuning without gradient approximation techniques. For the (7,4) block configuration over a binary symmetric channel (BSC), the learned encoder-decoder pair learns a rotated version (coset code) of the optimal Hamming code, naturally recovering its linear and distance properties and thereby achieving the same block error rate (BLER) with maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. These results indicate that compact AE architectures can effectively learn structured, algebraically optimal binary codes through stable and straightforward training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u4e8c\u503c\u5316\u7801\u5b57\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u56f0\u96be\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u5728BSC\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0a\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u6c49\u660e\u7801\u53d8\u4f53\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u52a8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5f3a\u5236\u4ea7\u751f\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u7801\u5b57\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u68af\u5ea6\u6d41\u4e2d\u65ad\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6536\u655b\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u7f16\u7801\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u7b80\u5316\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a0b\u5e8f\uff1a\u8fde\u7eed\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u76f4\u63a5\u4e8c\u503c\u5316\u548c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u68af\u5ea6\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6280\u672f\u3002\u5728(7,4)\u5757\u914d\u7f6e\u7684BSC\u4fe1\u9053\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7f16\u7801\u5668-\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u4f18\u6c49\u660e\u7801\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u7248\u672c\uff08\u966a\u96c6\u7801\uff09\uff0c\u81ea\u7136\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u5176\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u8ddd\u79bb\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u5927\u4f3c\u7136\u89e3\u7801\u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u5757\u9519\u8bef\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u76f4\u63a5\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u3001\u4ee3\u6570\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u7f16\u7801\uff0c\u4e3a\u901a\u4fe1\u7cfb\u7edf\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing embedding-based CAD approaches continuously update a memory bank with new embeddings to adapt to sequential tasks. However, these methods require constructing class-specific sub-memory banks for each task, which restricts their flexibility and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CAD framework where all tasks share a unified memory bank. During training, the method incrementally updates embeddings within a fixed-size coreset, enabling continuous knowledge acquisition from sequential tasks without task-specific memory fragmentation. In the inference phase, anomaly scores are computed via a nearest-neighbor matching mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art detection accuracy. We validate the method through comprehensive experiments on MVTec AD and Visa datasets.

It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction. In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail.

It is said to be maximum distance separable (MDS) if any $k$ out of $k+r$ coordinates suffice to reconstruct the whole codeword. The repair problem of binary MDS array codes has drawn much attention, particularly for single-node failures. In this paper, given an arbitrary binary MDS array code with sub-packetization $m$ as the base code, we propose two generic approaches (Generic Construction I and II) for constructing binary MDS array codes with optimal access (or repair) bandwidth for single-node failures. For every $s\\leq r$, a $(k+r,k,ms^{\\lceil \\frac{k+r}{s}\\rceil})$ code $\\mathcal{C}_1$ with optimal access bandwidth can be constructed by Generic Construction I. Repairing a failed node of $\\mathcal{C}_1$ requires connecting to $d = k+s-1$ helper nodes, in which $s-1$ helper nodes are designated and $k$ are free to select. $\\mathcal{C}_1$ generally achieves smaller sub-packetization and provides greater flexibility in the selection of its coefficient matrices.

However, existing compression methods primarily apply masks to suppress background information before quantization. This explicit bit allocation strategy, which uses hard gating, significantly impacts the statistical distribution of the entropy model, thereby limiting the coding performance of the compression model. In response, this work proposes an efficient ROI-based deep image compression model with implicit bit allocation. To better utilize ROI masks for implicit bit allocation, this paper proposes a novel Mask-Guided Feature Enhancement (MGFE) module, comprising a Region-Adaptive Attention (RAA) block and a Frequency-Spatial Collaborative Attention (FSCA) block. This module allows for flexible bit allocation across different regions while enhancing global and local features through frequencyspatial domain collaboration. Additionally, we use dual decoders to separately reconstruct foreground and background images, enabling the coding network to optimally balance foreground enhancement and background quality preservation in a datadriven manner.

However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise. Qualitative analyses further show that our model produces earlier, more stable, and human-aligned predictions in both routine and highly complex traffic scenarios, highlighting its potential for real-world, safety-critical deployment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u53bb\u566a\u548c\u65f6\u654f\u884c\u52a8\u8005-\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7684\u4e8b\u6545\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u65e9\u671f\u53ef\u9760\u9884\u8b66\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e8b\u6545\u9884\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u5927\u6311\u6218\uff1a\u5929\u6c14\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u7cca\u7b49\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8f93\u5165\u566a\u58f0/\u9000\u5316\uff1b\u9700\u8981\u5e73\u8861\u53ca\u65f6\u6027\uff08\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\uff09\u4e0e\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff08\u8bef\u62a5\u6291\u5236\uff09\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u5757\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u7ec6\u5316\u91cd\u5efa\u566a\u58f0\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u7269\u4f53\u7279\u5f81\uff1b\u65f6\u654f\u884c\u52a8\u8005-\u8bc4\u8bba\u5bb6\u67b6\u6784\u5229\u7528\u957f\u65f6\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u52a0\u6743\u5956\u52b1\u6765\u786e\u5b9a\u6700\u4f73\u9884\u8b66\u65f6\u673a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5e73\u5747\u4e8b\u6545\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9ad8\u65af\u548c\u8109\u51b2\u566a\u58f0\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e38\u89c4\u548c\u590d\u6742\u4ea4\u901a\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u65e9\u3001\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u9884\u671f\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u7f72\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

They have been enabled through surfaces with reconfigurable electromagnetic (EM) properties, known as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), and through flexible antennas, which can be viewed as realizations of SREs in the EM domain and space domain, respectively. However, these technologies rely on electronically reconfigurable or movable components, introducing implementation challenges that could hinder commercialization. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new domain to enable SREs, the frequency domain, through the concept of movable signals, where the signal spectrum can be dynamically moved along the frequency axis. We first analyze movable signals in multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems under line-of-sight (LoS) conditions, showing that they can achieve higher average received power than quantized equal gain transmission (EGT). We then study movable signals under non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions, showing that they remain effective by leveraging reflections from surfaces made of uniformly spaced elements with fixed EM properties, denoted as fixed intelligent surfaces (FISs). Analytical results reveal that a FIS-aided system using movable signals can achieve up to four times the received power of a RIS-aided system using fixed-frequency signals.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u9891\u57df\u5b9e\u73b0\u667a\u80fd\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u73af\u5883\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edfRIS\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u56fa\u5b9a\u786c\u4ef6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u52a8\u6001\u79fb\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u9891\u8c31\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u63a5\u6536\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u667a\u80fd\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u73af\u5883\u6280\u672f\u4f9d\u8d56\u7535\u5b50\u53ef\u91cd\u6784\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u5b9e\u65bd\u96be\u9898\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u514b\u670d\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5546\u4e1a\u5316\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u5728\u9891\u57df\u5b9e\u73b0\u667a\u80fd\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u73af\u5883\u7684\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5728\u9891\u57df\u52a8\u6001\u79fb\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u9891\u8c31\u3002\u5728\u7814\u7a76LOS\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0bMISO\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u540e\uff0c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7814\u7a76\u5728NLoS\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u5229\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u667a\u80fd\u8868\u9762\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u4f20\u8f93\u3002", "result": "\u5728LOS\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u6bd4\u91cf\u5316\u7b49\u589e\u76ca\u4f20\u8f93\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u5e73\u5747\u63a5\u6536\u529f\u7387\u3002\u5728NLoS\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0cFIS\u8f85\u52a9\u7684\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u8fbe\u5230\u4f7f\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u9891\u7387\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684RIS\u7cfb\u7edf\u56db\u500d\u7684\u63a5\u6536\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u79fb\u52a8\u4fe1\u53f7\u5728\u9891\u57df\u5b9e\u73b0\u667a\u80fd\u65e0\u7ebf\u7535\u73af\u5883\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u514b\u670d\u4f20\u7edf\u6280\u672f\u7684\u5b9e\u65bd\u6311\u6218\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

For scalar quantizers, posterior-expected MSE yields closed-form tables; task-aware proxies are handled by short Monte Carlo on a small calibration set.

While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime). We also provide an analysis on anonymization for sensitive temporal attribute recognition. Additionally, we propose new protocols for assessing gender bias in action recognition models, showing that our method effectively mitigates such biases and promotes more equitable video understanding.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fd0\u884c\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u533f\u540d\u5316\u9002\u914d\u5668\u6a21\u5757\u79fb\u9664\u89c6\u9891\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7528\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51bb\u7ed3\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4e0a\u4ee5\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u65b9\u5f0f\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u6f0f\u800c\u4e0d\u727a\u7272\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u7279\u5f81\u4f1a\u65e0\u610f\u4e2d\u6cc4\u9732\u5982\u80a4\u8272\u3001\u6027\u522b\u3001\u670d\u88c5\u7b49\u654f\u611f\u4e2a\u4eba\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u8f93\u5165\u50cf\u7d20\u7684\u533f\u540d\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6574\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u65b0\u5174\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u533f\u540d\u5316\u9002\u914d\u5668\u6a21\u5757(AAM)\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff1a1) \u526a\u8f91\u7ea7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u9690\u79c1\u76ee\u6807\u51cf\u5c11\u9759\u6001\u526a\u8f91\u95f4\u4e92\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b2) \u534f\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u4fdd\u6301\u5df2\u89c1\u4efb\u52a1\u6548\u7528\uff1b3) \u6f5c\u5728\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u635f\u5931\u4fc3\u8fdb\u672a\u89c1\u4efb\u52a1\u6cdb\u5316", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9690\u79c1\u6cc4\u6f0f\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e35%\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u4f5c\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u522b\u504f\u89c1", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u89c6\u9891\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6574\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u91cd\u65b0\u63d0\u53d6\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u80fd\u5728\u4fdd\u62a4\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u7ef4\u6301\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u80fd"}}

Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

Yet, for many practical systems -- especially in aerospace -- this region cannot be determined a priori and is often challenging to compute. One of the most common methods for computing the stability region is to identify a Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function is a positive function whose time derivative along system trajectories is non-positive, which provides a sufficient condition for stability and characterizes an estimated stability region. However, existing methods of characterizing a stability region via a Lyapunov function often rely on explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In this work, we present a new physics-informed machine learning method of characterizing an estimated stability region by inferring a Lyapunov function from system trajectory data that treats the dynamical system as a black box and does not require explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In our presented Lyapunov function Inference method (LyapInf), we propose a quadratic form for the unknown Lyapunov function and fit the unknown quadratic operator to system trajectory data by minimizing the average residual of the Zubov equation, a first-order partial differential equation whose solution yields a Lyapunov function. The inferred quadratic Lyapunov function can then characterize an ellipsoidal estimate of the stability region. Numerical results on benchmark examples demonstrate that our physics-informed stability analysis method successfully characterizes a near-maximal ellipsoid of the system stability region associated with the inferred Lyapunov function without requiring knowledge of the system governing equations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ece\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u63a8\u65adLyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u7a33\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4e86\u89e3\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u786e\u4fdd\u8f68\u8ff9\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5e73\u8861\u70b9\uff0c\u4f46\u7a33\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\u901a\u5e38\u96be\u4ee5\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e14\u4f9d\u8d56\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u7a0b\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLyapInf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5047\u8bbeLyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u4e3a\u4e8c\u6b21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316Zubov\u65b9\u7a0b\u6b8b\u5dee\u6765\u62df\u5408\u672a\u77e5\u4e8c\u6b21\u7b97\u5b50\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u8868\u5f81\u4e86\u8fd1\u6700\u5927\u7684\u692d\u5706\u7a33\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u7a0b\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7269\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\u7a33\u5b9a\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

Starting with images at resolutions of 32x32, we train a family of Transformers using IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs and evaluate three distinct target metrics: next-pixel prediction objective, ImageNet classification accuracy, and generation quality measured by Fr'echet Distance. First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size. Surprisingly, by projecting our findings, we discover that the primary bottleneck is compute rather than the amount of training data. As compute continues to grow four to five times annually, we forecast the feasibility of pixel-by-pixel modeling of images within the next five years.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u7279\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u6bd4\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u800c\u66f4\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\u6a21\u578b\u5c3a\u5bf8\u589e\u957f\u5fc5\u987b\u8fdc\u5feb\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u9884\u6d4b\u8fd9\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u4f46\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u89c6\u89c9\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6269\u5c55\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u6307\u6807\u4e0b\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "method": "\u572832x32\u50cf\u7d20\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u53ca\u66f4\u9ad8\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217Transformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528IsoFlops\u914d\u7f6e\u6587\u4ef6\u8ba1\u7b97\u9884\u7b97\u8fbe7e19 FLOPs\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u4e0b\u4e00\u50cf\u7d20\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u3001ImageNet\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\uff08Fr'echet\u8ddd\u79bb\uff09\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u6269\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\u5177\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u6700\u4f73\u8bbe\u7f6e\u9700\u8981\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u589e\u957f\u6bd4\u5206\u7c7b\u6700\u4f18\u8bbe\u7f6e\u5feb3-5\u500d\uff1b\u968f\u7740\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u5fc5\u987b\u6bd4\u6570\u636e\u89c4\u6a21\u589e\u957f\u5feb\u5f97\u591a\uff1b\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9884\u6d4b\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u800c\u975e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u91cf\uff0c\u9884\u8ba1\u672a\u6765\u4e94\u5e74\u5185\u968f\u7740\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u529b\u6301\u7eed\u4ee54-5\u500d\u7684\u5e74\u5ea6\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u9010\u50cf\u7d20\u5efa\u6a21\u56fe\u50cf\u662f\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u3002"}}

This formulation links guidance, control, and FDI by using the same cost function to drive both global task allocation and local sensing or motion decisions. Fault detection is achieved through comparisons between expected and observed task metrics, while higher-order cost-gradient measures enable the identification of faults among sensors, actuators, and state estimators.

This makes it especially desirable for resource-constrained fields such as the medical domain. While recent GNN-based approaches show promise, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) matrix-based node super-resolution that disregards graph structure and lacks permutation invariance; and (2) reliance on node representations to infer edge weights, which limits scalability and expressivity. In this work, we propose two GNN-agnostic frameworks to address these issues. First, Bi-SR introduces a bipartite graph connecting LR and HR nodes to enable structure-aware node super-resolution that preserves topology and permutation invariance. Second, DEFEND learns edge representations by mapping HR edges to nodes of a dual graph, allowing edge inference via standard node-based GNNs.

We explicitly model how inter-agent coordination structures evolve over time. While most MARL approaches rely on static or per-step relational graphs, they overlook the temporal evolution of interactions that naturally arise as agents adapt, move, or reorganize cooperation strategies. Capturing such evolving dependencies is key to achieving robust and adaptive coordination. To this end, TIGER constructs dynamic temporal graphs of MARL agents, connecting their current and historical interactions. It then employs a temporal attention-based encoder to aggregate information across these structural and temporal neighborhoods, yielding time-aware agent embeddings that guide cooperative policy learning. Through extensive experiments on two coordination-intensive benchmarks, we show that TIGER consistently outperforms diverse value-decomposition and graph-based MARL baselines in task performance and sample efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to isolate the impact of key design parameters in TIGER, revealing how structural and temporal factors can jointly shape effective policy learning in MARL.

For example, in face datasets for hair color classification, blond hair may be disproportionately associated with females, reinforcing stereotypes. A recent approach leverages the Stable Diffusion model to generate balanced training data, but these models often struggle to preserve the original data distribution. In this work, we explore multiple diffusion-finetuning techniques, e.g., LoRA and DreamBooth, to generate images that more accurately represent each training group by learning directly from their samples. Additionally, in order to prevent a single DreamBooth model from being overwhelmed by excessive intra-group variations, we explore a technique of clustering images within each group and train a DreamBooth model per cluster. These models are then used to generate group-balanced data for pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the studied finetuning approaches outperform vanilla Stable Diffusion on average and achieve results comparable to SOTA debiasing techniques like Group-DRO, while surpassing them as the dataset bias severity increases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\uff08LoRA\u548cDreamBooth\uff09\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u8861\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u5206\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u89e3\u51b3\u7ec4\u5185\u53d8\u5f02\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6Stable Diffusion\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5e38\u5e38\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7fa4\u4f53\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u6bd4\u5982\u4eba\u8138\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u91d1\u53d1\u7279\u5f81\u4e0e\u5973\u6027\u7684\u5f3a\u5173\u8054\u3002\u867d\u7136\u5df2\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528Stable Diffusion\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "method": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4e86\u591a\u79cd\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5305\u62ecLoRA\u548cDreamBooth\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u6bcf\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ec4\u7684\u6837\u672c\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u3002\u4e3a\u9632\u5355\u4e2aDreamBooth\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u7ec4\u5185\u53d8\u5f02\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7ec4\u5185\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u805a\u7c7b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u4e2aDreamBooth\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6240\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cbStable Diffusion\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u504f\u89c1\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e86SOTA\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u89c1\u6280\u672f\u5982Group-DRO\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\u6280\u672f\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u8861\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5bf9\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u662f\u51cf\u8f7b\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u504f\u89c1\u7684\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u504f\u89c1\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u4f73\u3002"}}

Code and data available at https://github.com/alvco/Founding_Fathers_AI", "summary": "Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional fluency, efforts persist to extract stronger reasoning capabilities from them. Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing.

However, the addition of differential privacy (DP) often degrades model accuracy by introducing both noise and bias. Existing techniques typically address only one of these issues, as reducing DP noise can exacerbate clipping bias and vice-versa. In this paper, we propose a novel method, \\emph{DP-PMLF}, which integrates per-sample momentum with a low-pass filtering strategy to simultaneously mitigate DP noise and clipping bias. Our approach uses per-sample momentum to smooth gradient estimates prior to clipping, thereby reducing sampling variance. It further employs a post-processing low-pass filter to attenuate high-frequency DP noise without consuming additional privacy budget. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating an improved convergence rate under rigorous DP guarantees, and our empirical evaluations reveal that DP-PMLF significantly enhances the privacy-utility trade-off compared to several state-of-the-art DPSGD variants.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faDP-PMLF\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u6bcf\u6837\u672c\u52a8\u91cf\u548c\u4f4e\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u8f7b\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u4e2d\u7684\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u88c1\u526a\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9690\u79c1-\u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u7684\u5f15\u5165\u4f1a\u901a\u8fc7\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u504f\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u53ea\u89e3\u51b3\u5176\u4e2d\u4e00\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u566a\u58f0\u53ef\u80fd\u52a0\u5267\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u53cd\u4e4b\u4ea6\u7136\u3002", "method": "DP-PMLF\u96c6\u6210\u6bcf\u6837\u672c\u52a8\u91cf\u548c\u4f4e\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u4f7f\u7528\u6bcf\u6837\u672c\u52a8\u91cf\u5bf9\u88c1\u526a\u524d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u8fdb\u884c\u5e73\u6ed1\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u91c7\u6837\u65b9\u5dee\uff1b\u91c7\u7528\u540e\u5904\u7406\u7684\u4f4e\u901a\u6ee4\u6ce2\u5668\u8870\u51cf\u9ad8\u9891\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4e0d\u6d88\u8017\u989d\u5916\u9690\u79c1\u9884\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u3002\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660eDP-PMLF\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709DPSGD\u53d8\u4f53\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9690\u79c1-\u6548\u7528\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "DP-PMLF\u901a\u8fc7\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u8f7b\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5728\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u6536\u655b\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002"}}

For nonlinear systems, carefully selected sensor motion can be exploited to extract information that is otherwise unavailable, i.e. active sensing. Empirical, yet mathematically rigorous, tools are needed to (1) quantify how sensor movement can contribute to estimation performance, and (2) leverage this knowledge to improve state estimates. Here, we introduce \"BOUNDS: Bounding Observability for Uncertain Nonlinear Dynamic Systems\", and Python package pybounds, which can discover patterns of sensor motion that increase information for individual state variables. Crucially, it is suitable for partially observable nonlinear systems, accounts for sensor noise, and can be applied to either simulated or observed trajectories. We demonstrate BOUNDS through a case study on a flying agent with limited sensors, showing how active sensing can be leveraged to estimate key variables such as ground speed, altitude, and ambient wind direction. Finally, we present a framework to refine sporadic estimates from bouts of active sensing that combines data-driven state and observability estimation from artificial neural networks with model-based estimation, which we call the Augmented Information Kalman Filter (AI-KF). We validate our framework using altitude estimation given GPS-denied data from an outdoor quadcopter flight.

In particular, we establish a complete characterization of the expressive power of EC on general color-based filtrations. We also show that the PH descriptors of (virtual) graph products contain strictly more information than the computation on individual graphs, whereas EC does not. Additionally, we provide algorithms to compute the PH diagrams of the product of vertex- and edge-level filtrations on the graph product. We also substantiate our theoretical analysis with empirical investigations on runtime analysis, expressivity, and graph classification performance.

However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.\n  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "Argus\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u97e7\u6027\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u589e\u5f3a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7\u8f68\u8ff9\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u9a7e\u9a76\u5371\u9669\u3001\u9632\u6b62\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u516c\u5171\u9053\u8def\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u4f1a\u66b4\u9732\u4e8e\u5404\u79cd\u9a7e\u9a76\u5371\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5177\u5907\u76d1\u63a7\u5371\u9669\u548c\u5e94\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u7cfb\u7edf\u97e7\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faArgus\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7ADS\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5f53\u8f66\u8f86\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u5371\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u5668\u63a5\u7ba1\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0eTCP\u3001UniAD\u3001VAD\u4e09\u79cd\u5148\u8fdbADS\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "Argus\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347ADS\u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u63d0\u9ad8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8bc4\u5206\u8fbe150.30%\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u9ad8\u8fbe64.38%\u7684\u8fdd\u89c4\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4e14\u989d\u5916\u65f6\u95f4\u5f00\u9500\u5f88\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "Argus\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u9ad8\u6548\u5730\u589e\u5f3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u97e7\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u9a7e\u9a76\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\u3002"}}

Previous methods have demonstrated successful applications on a wide range of toy models, but the gap to \"real models\" has not yet been bridged. In this work, we extend Stochastic Parameter Decomposition (SPD) to Transformer models, proposing an updated causal importance function suited for sequential data and a new loss function. We demonstrate that SPD can successfully decompose a toy induction-head model and recover the expected 2-step circuit. We also show that applying SPD to GPT-2-small can successfully locate subcomponents corresponding to interpretable concepts like \"golf\" and \"basketball\".

Existing diffusion-based approaches focus rather on small camera movements in real scenes or only consider unnatural object-centric scenes, limiting their potential applications in real-world settings. In this paper we move away from these constrained regimes and propose a 3D diffusion model trained with image-only losses on a large-scale dataset of real-world, multi-category, unaligned, and casually acquired videos of everyday scenes. We propose DT-NVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for generalized novel view synthesis that exploits a transformer-based architecture backbone. We make significant contributions to transformer and self-attention architectures to translate images to 3d representations, and novel camera conditioning strategies to allow training on real-world unaligned datasets. In addition, we introduce a novel training paradigm swapping the role of reference frame between the conditioning image and the sampled noisy input. We evaluate our approach on the 3D task of generalized novel view synthesis from a single input image and show improvements over state-of-the-art 3D aware diffusion models and deterministic approaches, while generating diverse outputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86DT-NVS\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8etransformer\u76843D\u611f\u77e5\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u7684\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u9650\u4e8e\u5c0f\u8303\u56f4\u76f8\u673a\u79fb\u52a8\u6216\u4eba\u9020\u7269\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u573a\u666f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u5c0f\u5e45\u76f8\u673a\u79fb\u52a8\u6216\u975e\u81ea\u7136\u7269\u4f53\u4e2d\u5fc3\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7a81\u7834\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9650\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u4ec5\u5728\u56fe\u50cf\u635f\u5931\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u591a\u7c7b\u522b\u89c6\u9891\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec33D\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u91c7\u7528transformer\u67b6\u6784\u9aa8\u5e72\uff1b\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u9896\u7684transformer\u548c\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u67b6\u6784\u6539\u8fdb\u3001\u76f8\u673a\u6761\u4ef6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u53c2\u8003\u5e27\u89d2\u8272\u4ea4\u6362\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5355\u8f93\u5165\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u5e7f\u4e49\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u5408\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u76843D\u611f\u77e5\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6240\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6210\u529f\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u591a\u6837\u5316\u65b0\u89c6\u89d2\u76843D\u611f\u77e5\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5e94\u7528\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for automation, the generalization ability and data efficiency of existing LLM-based methods are still limited, asmost require vast amounts of annotated or synthetic data, resulting in high costs and scalability barriers. In this work, we present OR-R1, a data-efficient training framework for automated optimization modeling and solving. OR-R1 first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to help the model acquire the essential reasoning patterns for problem formulation and code generation from limited labeled data. In addition, it improves the capability and consistency through Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO). This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning. Experiments show that OR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average solving accuracy of $67.7\\%$, using only $1/10$ the synthetic data required by prior methods such as ORLM, exceeding ORLM's solving accuracy by up to $4.2\\%$. Remarkably, OR-R1 outperforms ORLM by over $2.4\\%$ with just $100$ synthetic samples. Furthermore, TGRPO contributes an additional $3.1\\%-6.4\\%$ improvement in accuracy, significantly narrowing the gap between single-attempt (Pass@1) and multi-attempt (Pass@8) performance from $13\\%$ to $7\\%$. Extensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that OR-R1 provides a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for automated OR optimization problem modeling and solving, lowering the expertise and data barriers for industrial OR applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "OR-R1\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u7fa4\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75281/10\u6570\u636e\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8fbe\u523067.7%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6c42\u89e3\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u8fd0\u8425\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u73b0\u6709LLM\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u53d7\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u638c\u63e1\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u95f4\u7fa4\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u5927\u91cf\u65e0\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5ORLM\uff0c\u4f7f\u75281/10\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u53474.2%\uff1b\u4ec5\u7528100\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u65f6\u63d0\u53472.4%\uff1bTGRPO\u5e26\u6765\u989d\u59163.1%-6.4%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5c06\u5355\u6b21\u548c\u591a\u5c1d\u8bd5\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u4ece13%\u964d\u81f37%\u3002", "conclusion": "OR-R1\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316OR\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u7ecf\u6d4e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u4e13\u957f\u548c\u6570\u636e\u95e8\u69db\u3002"}}

This research aims to improve warehouse picking cycle time through simulation-based analysis, using a leading plumbing equipment distributor in Thailand as a case study. The study identifies inefficiencies such as disorganized storage and poor placement of high-frequency items that slow down picking.

However, forecasting SWE is challenging because SWE is influenced by various factors including topography and an array of environmental conditions, and has therefore been observed to be spatio-temporally variable. Classical approaches to SWE forecasting have not adequately utilized these spatial/temporal correlations, nor do they provide uncertainty estimates -- which can be of significant value to the decision maker. In this paper, we present ForeSWE, a new probabilistic spatio-temporal forecasting model that integrates deep learning and classical probabilistic techniques. The resulting model features a combination of an attention mechanism to integrate spatiotemporal features and interactions, alongside a Gaussian process module that provides principled quantification of prediction uncertainty. We evaluate the model on data from 512 Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations in the Western US. The results show significant improvements in both forecasting accuracy and prediction interval compared to existing approaches. The results also serve to highlight the efficacy in uncertainty estimates between different approaches.

However, these approaches often suffer from the loss of global pose information, making them incapable of distinguishing geometrically similar but spatially distinct structures. We identify that this limitation stems from the restricted receptive field in existing RI methods, leading to Wing-tip feature collapse, a failure to differentiate symmetric components (e.g., left and right airplane wings) due to indistinguishable local geometries. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF), which augments local RI descriptors with a globally consistent reference point (referred to as the 'shadow') derived from a learned shared rotation. This mechanism enables the model to preserve global pose awareness while maintaining rotation invariance. We further propose Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv), an attention-based operator that integrates SiPFs into the feature aggregation process, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish structurally similar components. Additionally, we design a task-adaptive shadow locating module based on the Bingham distribution over unit quaternions, which dynamically learns the optimal global rotation for constructing consistent shadows.

To address these challenges, we present EEG-X, a device-agnostic and noise-robust foundation model for EEG representation learning. EEG-X introduces a novel location-based channel embedding that encodes spatial information and improves generalization across domains and tasks by allowing the model to handle varying channel numbers, combinations, and recording lengths. To enhance robustness against noise, EEG-X employs a noise-aware masking and reconstruction strategy in both raw and latent spaces. Unlike previous models that mask and reconstruct raw noisy EEG signals, EEG-X is trained to reconstruct denoised signals obtained through an artifact removal process, ensuring that the learned representations focus on neural activity rather than noise. To further enhance reconstruction-based pretraining, EEG-X introduces a dictionary-inspired convolutional transformation (DiCT) layer that projects signals into a structured feature space before computing reconstruction (MSE) loss, reducing noise sensitivity and capturing frequency- and shape-aware similarities. Experiments on datasets collected from diverse devices show that EEG-X outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple downstream EEG tasks and excels in cross-domain settings where pre-trained and downstream datasets differ in electrode layouts.

While recent deep learning models have advanced automated staging, most rely solely on raw PSG signals and neglect contextual cues used by human experts. We propose a two-stage architecture that combines a Transformer-based per-epoch encoder with a 1D CNN aggregator, and systematically investigates the effect of incorporating explicit context: subject-level clinical metadata (age, sex, BMI) and per-epoch expert event annotations (apneas, desaturations, arousals, periodic breathing). Using the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) cohort (n=8,357), we demonstrate that contextual fusion substantially improves staging accuracy. Compared to a PSG-only baseline (macro-F1 0.7745, micro-F1 0.8774), our final model achieves macro-F1 0.8031 and micro-F1 0.9051, with event annotations contributing the largest gains. Notably, feature fusion outperforms multi-task alternatives that predict the same auxiliary labels. These results highlight that augmenting learned representations with clinically meaningful features enhances both performance and interpretability, without modifying the PSG montage or requiring additional sensors.

However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties. Besides, on the practical side, extensive experiments on five mathematical benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and token efficiency, which achieves an 8.1% accuracy improvement and a 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B.

Using the differential formulation of the LPV-MPC, we demonstrate how SQP and LPV-MPC can be unified through a specific choice of scheduling variable and the 2nd Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC) embedding technique and compare their convergence properties. This enables the unification of the zero-order approach of SQP with the LPV-MPC scheduling technique to enhance the computational efficiency of stochastic and robust MPC problems.

Despite clinical diagnostic advancements, there have not been any substantial improvements to patient prognosis. Histopathological assessment of excised tumors is the first line of clinical diagnostic routine. We hypothesize that automated, robust, and accurate identification of distinct histological sub-regions within GBM could contribute to morphologically understanding this disease at scale. In this study, we designed a four-step deep learning approach to classify six (6) histopathological regions and quantitatively evaluated it on the BraTS-Path 2024 challenge dataset, which includes digitized Hematoxylin \\& Eosin (H\\&E) stained GBM tissue sections annotated for six distinct regions. We used the challenge's publicly available training dataset to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of several variants of EfficientNet architectures (i.e., B0, B1, B2, B3, B4). EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved the best performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 in a 5-fold cross-validation configuration using the BraTS-Path training set. The quantitative performance evaluation of our proposed approach with EfficientNet-B1 on the BraTS-Path hold-out validation data and the final hidden testing data yielded F1 scores of 0.546 and 0.517, respectively, for the associated 6-class classification task. The difference in the performance on training, validation, and testing data highlights the challenge of developing models that generalize well to new data, which is crucial for clinical applications.

We show that spectral predictability~$\u03a9$ -- a simple signal processing metric -- systematically stratifies model family performance, enabling fast model selection. We conduct controlled experiments in four different domains, then further expand our analysis to 51 models and 28 datasets from the GIFT-Eval benchmark. We find that large time series foundation models (TSFMs) systematically outperform lightweight task-trained baselines when $\u03a9$ is high, while their advantage vanishes as $\u03a9$ drops. Computing $\u03a9$ takes seconds per dataset, enabling practitioners to quickly assess whether their data suits TSFM approaches or whether simpler, cheaper models suffice. We demonstrate that $\u03a9$ stratifies model performance predictably, offering a practical first-pass filter that reduces validation costs while highlighting the need for models that excel on genuinely difficult (low-$\u03a9$) problems rather than merely optimizing easy ones.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8c31\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u6307\u6807\u03a9\u80fd\u591f\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u5206\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u5feb\u901f\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u5408\u9002\u7684\u65f6\u5e8f\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5f53\u03a9\u8f83\u9ad8\u65f6\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u65f6\u5e8f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\uff1b\u5f53\u03a9\u8f83\u4f4e\u65f6\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u6a21\u578b\u5c31\u8db3\u591f\u4e86\u3002\u03a9\u8ba1\u7b97\u901f\u5ea6\u5feb\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u7b5b\u9009\u5de5\u5177\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u5e8f\u9884\u6d4b\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfb\u627e\u4e00\u79cd\u5feb\u901f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u7b5b\u9009\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8c31\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u03a9\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u53d7\u63a7\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728GIFT-Eval\u57fa\u51c6\u768451\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u548c28\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u6269\u5c55\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u03a9\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u5206\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff1a\u5f53\u03a9\u9ad8\u65f6\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u65f6\u5e8f\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u4e8e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u03a9\u4f4e\u65f6\uff0c\u4e24\u8005\u8868\u73b0\u76f8\u5f53\u3002\u03a9\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ec5\u9700\u51e0\u79d2\u949f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8c31\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u03a9\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u7b5b\u9009\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u5728\u4f4e\u03a9\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u65b0\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

While numerical laboratory measurements are highly informative, existing embedding strategies usually combine feature identity and value embeddings through additive operations, which constrains their ability to capture value-dependent feature interactions. We propose MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series centered on the MuFuse (Multiplicative Embedding Fusion) module. MuFuse fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features. Experiments on three real-world datasets covering both intensive and chronic care show that MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks.

However, implementing SCKD becomes exceedingly constrained in real-world scenarios due to the limited availability of paired modalities. To this end, we investigate a general and effective knowledge learning concept under weak semantic consistency, dubbed Asymmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ACKD), aiming to bridge modalities with limited semantic overlap. Nevertheless, the shift from strong to weak semantic consistency improves flexibility but exacerbates challenges in knowledge transmission costs, which we rigorously verified based on optimal transport theory. To mitigate the issue, we further propose a framework, namely SemBridge, integrating a Student-Friendly Matching module and a Semantic-aware Knowledge Alignment module. The former leverages self-supervised learning to acquire semantic-based knowledge and provide personalized instruction for each student sample by dynamically selecting the relevant teacher samples. The latter seeks the optimal transport path by employing Lagrangian optimization.

To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch.

Unlike traditional approaches that rely solely on offline models, we propose a framework that incorporates real-time observations to dynamically refine probability estimates for safety and reach-avoid events. By introducing observation-aware barrier functions, our method adaptively updates probability bounds as new observations are collected, combining efficient offline computation with online backward iteration.

We propose a paradigm shift from \"model training\" to \"model raising\", in which alignment is woven into a model's development from the start. We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate. In an ecosystem in which large language model capabilities start overtaking human capabilities in many tasks, this seems to us like a critical need.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4ece\"\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\"\u8f6c\u5411\"\u6a21\u578b\u57f9\u517b\"\u7684\u8303\u5f0f\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\uff0c\u5c06\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u878d\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dAI\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u5728\u6a21\u578b\u6838\u5fc3\u80fd\u529b\u5efa\u7acb\u540e\u624d\u8fdb\u884c\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u6613\u88ab\u8bef\u5bfc\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6df1\u5c42\u4ef7\u503c\u4f53\u7cfb\u3002\u5728LLM\u80fd\u529b\u5f00\u59cb\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u7c7b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e00\u5f00\u59cb\u5c31\u690d\u5165\u4ef7\u503c\u7cfb\u7edf", "method": "\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bed\u6599\uff1a\u91c7\u7b2c\u4e00\u4eba\u79f0\u89c6\u89d2\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6846\u67b6\u3001\u5c06\u4fe1\u606f\u91cd\u5851\u4e3a\u751f\u6d3b\u4f53\u9a8c\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u793e\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u3001\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u987a\u5e8f\u5b89\u6392", "result": "\u671f\u671b\u901a\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bed\u6599\u91cd\u65b0\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u80fd\u4ece\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6807\u8bb0\u5f00\u59cb\u5c31\u5efa\u7acb\u4ef7\u503c\u627f\u8bfa\uff0c\u4f7f\u77e5\u8bc6\u3001\u6280\u80fd\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u89c2\u5185\u5728\u5730\u66f4\u96be\u4ee5\u5206\u79bb", "conclusion": "\u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u5f00\u59cb\u8d85\u8d8a\u4eba\u7c7b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e4b\u521d\u5c31\u878d\u5165\u4ef7\u503c\u5bf9\u9f50\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9700\u6c42"}}

In the proposed input/state observer, each agent estimates the state and input of agents located two or more hops away using only local information exchanged with 1-hop neighbors, while guaranteeing that transient estimation errors satisfy predefined performance bounds. Conditions are established under which the input observer can be omitted, allowing the state observer convergence to be independent of the input estimates. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that if a closed-loop controller with full state knowledge achieves the control objective and the estimation-based closed-loop system is set-Input to State Stable (set-ISS) with respect to the goal set, then the estimated states can be used to achieve the system objective with an arbitrarily small worst-case error governed by the accuracy of the states estimates.

Recently, diffusion models have been leveraged for their strong distribution-matching capabilities, enforcing conservatism through behavior policy constraints. However, existing methods often apply indiscriminate regularization to redundant actions in low-quality datasets, resulting in excessive conservatism and an imbalance between the expressiveness and efficiency of diffusion modeling. To address these issues, we propose DIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality, broadly covered in-distribution state-action samples while facilitating efficient policy improvement. Specifically, DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism that utilizes the advantage values of actions in the offline dataset to guide diffusion model training. This enables a more precise alignment with the dataset's distribution while selectively expanding the boundaries of high-advantage actions. During policy improvement, DIVO dynamically filters high-return-potential actions from the diffusion model, effectively guiding the learned policy toward better performance. This approach achieves a critical balance between conservatism and explorability in offline RL. We evaluate DIVO on the D4RL benchmark and compare it against state-of-the-art baselines. Empirical results demonstrate that DIVO achieves superior performance, delivering significant improvements in average returns across locomotion tasks and outperforming existing methods in the challenging AntMaze domain, where sparse rewards pose a major difficulty.", "AI": {"tldr": "DIVO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u4ef7\u503c\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u6269\u5c55\u9ad8\u4f18\u52bf\u52a8\u4f5c\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u4e0e\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u95f4\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u7531\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u52a8\u4f5c\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u9ad8\u4f30\u4e25\u91cd\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u7531\u4e8e\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5197\u4f59\u52a8\u4f5c\u8fdb\u884c\u4e0d\u5206\u533a\u522b\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u4ee5\u53ca\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO)\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u4e8c\u5143\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u79bb\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u52a8\u4f5c\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u503c\u6307\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u4ece\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u7b5b\u9009\u9ad8\u56de\u62a5\u6f5c\u529b\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5f15\u5bfc\u5b66\u4e60\u7b56\u7565\u5411\u66f4\u597d\u6027\u80fd\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "result": "\u5728D4RL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDIVO\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u5353\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5e73\u5747\u56de\u62a5\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684AntMaze\u9886\u57df\uff08\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u96be\u70b9\uff09\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DIVO\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u4ef7\u503c\u6761\u4ef6\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u5904\u7406\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u52a8\u4f5c\u5f15\u8d77\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Building upon our previous simulation study published in this journal, this study implements and evaluates the spectral-based approach on physical hardware to address this limitation. Specifically, this paper introduces HitoMi-Cam, a lightweight and shape-agnostic person detection method that uses the spectral reflectance properties of clothing. The author implemented the system on a resource-constrained edge device without a GPU to assess its practical viability. The results indicate that a processing speed of 23.2 frames per second (fps) (253x190 pixels) is achievable, suggesting that the method can be used for real-time applications. In a simulated search and rescue scenario where the performance of CNNs declines, HitoMi-Cam achieved an average precision (AP) of 93.5%, surpassing that of the compared CNN models (best AP of 53.8%). Throughout all evaluation scenarios, the occurrence of false positives remained minimal. This study positions the HitoMi-Cam method not as a replacement for CNN-based detectors but as a complementary tool under specific conditions.

However, although these approaches perform well within training domains, they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization, often producing hallucinated content when encountering novel visual environments. Retrieval-based methods attempt to mitigate this limitation by leveraging external knowledge, but they can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination when retrieved captions contain entities irrelevant to the inputs. We introduce the concept of negative entities--objects that appear in generated caption but are absent from the input--and propose Negative Entity Suppression (NES) to tackle this challenge. NES seamlessly integrates three stages: (1) it employs synthetic images to ensure consistent image-to-text retrieval across both training and inference; (2) it filters negative entities from retrieved content to enhance accuracy; and (3) it applies attention-level suppression using identified negative entities to further minimize the impact of hallucination-prone features. Evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that NES maintains competitive in-domain performance while improving cross-domain transfer and reducing hallucination rates, achieving new state-of-the-art results in ZIC.

We evaluate DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 and as reference the planner LAMA on a subset of domains from the most recent Learning Track of the International Planning Competition. Our results show that on standard PDDL domains, the performance of GPT-5 in terms of solved tasks is competitive with LAMA. When the PDDL domains and tasks are obfuscated to test for pure reasoning, the performance of all LLMs degrades, though less severely than previously reported for other models.

Given the resource constraints of these devices, quantization offers a promising solution by improving memory efficiency and reducing bandwidth requirements, thereby facilitating the deployment of VLMs. However, existing research has rarely explored aggressive quantization on VLMs, particularly for the models ranging from 1B to 2B parameters, which are more suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we propose SPEED-Q, a novel Staged Processing with Enhanced Distillation framework for VLM low-bit weight-only quantization that systematically addresses the following two critical obstacles: (1) significant discrepancies in quantization sensitivity between vision (ViT) and language (LLM) components in VLMs; (2) training instability arising from the reduced numerical precision inherent in low-bit quantization. In SPEED-Q, a staged sensitivity adaptive mechanism is introduced to effectively harmonize performance across different modalities. We further propose a distillation-enhanced quantization strategy to stabilize the training process and reduce data dependence. Together, SPEED-Q enables accurate, stable, and data-efficient quantization of complex VLMs. SPEED-Q is the first framework tailored for quantizing entire small-scale billion-parameter VLMs to low bits. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SPEED-Q achieves up to 6x higher accuracy than existing quantization methods under 2-bit settings and consistently outperforms prior on-device VLMs under both 2-bit and 4-bit settings.

Our results highlight a simple yet powerful mechanism for analyzing, controlling, and repurposing latent representations, providing a pathway toward using generative models for scientific exploration of what we don't capture, consider, or catalog.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u81ea\u7531\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5206\u79bb\u6f5c\u5728\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8bbf\u95ee\u548c\u5206\u6790\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\uff0c\u8bbf\u95ee\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u79d1\u5b66\u53d1\u73b0\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u660e\u786e\u5206\u79bb\u6761\u4ef6\u4fe1\u606f\u4e0e\u6b8b\u5dee\u8868\u793a\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u6f5c\u5728\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u4e0e\u5206\u7c7b\u5668\u81ea\u7531\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff08\u5408\u62102D\u9ad8\u65af\u95ee\u9898\u3001\u5f69\u8272MNIST\u548cGalaxy10\u5929\u6587\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff09\u4e2d\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6765\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7ef4\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u8bbf\u95ee\uff0c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u91cd\u7528\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u4f7f\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u79d1\u5b66\u63a2\u7d22\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u6761\u6709\u6548\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5bf9\u4e8e\u90a3\u4e9b\u672a\u88ab\u6355\u83b7\u3001\u8003\u8651\u6216\u7f16\u76ee\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u8bbf\u95ee\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Existing defenses often attempt to identify and remove backdoor neurons based on Trigger-Activated Changes (TAC) which is the activation differences between clean and poisoned data. These methods suffer from low precision in identifying true backdoor neurons due to inaccurate estimation of TAC values. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor removal method by accurately reconstructing TAC values in the latent representation. Specifically, we formulate the minimal perturbation that forces clean data to be classified into a specific class as a convex quadratic optimization problem, whose optimal solution serves as a surrogate for TAC. We then identify the poisoned class by detecting statistically small $L^2$ norms of perturbations and leverage the perturbation of the poisoned class in fine-tuning to remove backdoors. Experiments on CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and TinyImageNet demonstrated that our approach consistently achieves superior backdoor suppression with high clean accuracy across different attack types, datasets, and architectures, outperforming existing defense methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u6784\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u7684\u89e6\u53d1\u6fc0\u6d3b\u53d8\u5316\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u79fb\u9664\u540e\u95e8\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u653b\u51fb\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u89e6\u53d1\u6fc0\u6d3b\u53d8\u5316\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u540e\u95e8\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u4f46\u5f80\u5f80\u7531\u4e8e\u5bf9TAC\u503c\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u7cbe\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u771f\u6b63\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u795e\u7ecf\u5143\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9632\u5fa1\u6548\u679c\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u5c06\u8feb\u4f7f\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u88ab\u5206\u7c7b\u5230\u7279\u5b9a\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6700\u5c0f\u6270\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u51f8\u4e8c\u6b21\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5176\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u4f5c\u4e3aTAC\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u6d4b\u6270\u52a8L2\u8303\u6570\u7edf\u8ba1\u4e0a\u8f83\u5c0f\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u6765\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u6bd2\u7c7b\u522b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5229\u7528\u4e2d\u6bd2\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u6270\u52a8\u6765\u79fb\u9664\u540e\u95e8\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10\u3001GTSRB\u548cTinyImageNet\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u7c7b\u578b\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u90fd\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u6291\u5236\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u5e72\u51c0\u6570\u636e\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u9632\u5fa1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u51c6\u786e\u91cd\u6784TAC\u503c\u5e76\u5229\u7528\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u6c42\u89e3\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u540e\u95e8\u79fb\u9664\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

Existing collaborative methods are dominantly built upon the de facto human-vision compression pipeline, witnessing deficiency on complexity and bit-rates when aggregating the machine-vision compression. Indeed, machine vision solely focuses on the core regions within the image/video, requiring much less information compared with the compressed information for human vision. In this paper, we thus set out the first successful attempt by a novel collaborative compression method based on the machine-vision-oriented compression, instead of human-vision pipeline. In other words, machine vision serves as the basis for human vision within collaborative compression. A plug-and-play variable bit-rate strategy is also developed for machine vision tasks. Then, we propose to progressively aggregate the semantics from the machine-vision compression, whilst seamlessly tailing the diffusion prior to restore high-fidelity details for human vision, thus named as diffusion-prior based feature compression for human and machine visions (Diff-FCHM).

Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-level description or visual question answering, CrochetBench shifts the emphasis from describing to doing: models are required to recognize stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate compilable crochet procedures. We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis.

While trajectory-based and distribution-based step distillation methods offer solutions, they present a fundamental trade-off. Trajectory-based methods preserve global structure but act as a \"lossy compressor\", sacrificing high-frequency details. Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch\", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. On ImageNet $256\\times256$, our single-step model achieves an FID of 2.26, rivaling its 250-step teacher. It also achieves promising results on the high-resolution text-to-image MJHQ benchmark, proving its generalizability.

We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use.

NBVC can adopt bi-directional reference frames for better compression performance. However, NBVC's hierarchical coding may complicate continuous temporal prediction, especially at some hierarchical levels with a large frame span, which could cause the contribution of the two reference frames to be unbalanced. To optimize reference information utilization, we propose a novel NBVC method, termed Bi-directional Reference Harmonization Video Compression (BRHVC), with the proposed Bi-directional Motion Converge (BMC) and Bi-directional Contextual Fusion (BCF). BMC converges multiple optical flows in motion compression, leading to more accurate motion compensation on a larger scale. Then BCF explicitly models the weights of reference contexts under the guidance of motion compensation accuracy. With more efficient motions and contexts, BRHVC can effectively harmonize bi-directional references. Experimental results indicate that our BRHVC outperforms previous state-of-the-art NVC methods, even surpassing the traditional coding, VTM-RA (under random access configuration), on the HEVC datasets.

Using real-world datasets across breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and sepsis, we demonstrate concordance between successive AI models, with up to 64.8% overlap in top 5% high-risk cohorts. We then simulate a series of breast cancer screening studies, where our design reduced required enrollment by 46.6%--saving over US$2.8 million--while maintaining 80% power.

Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) are efficient in generating high-quality images, but their inherent self-similarity limits the diversity of output images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the Hausdorff Dimension (HD), a widely recognized concept in fractal geometry used to quantify structural complexity, which aids in enhancing the diversity of generated outputs. To incorporate HD into FGM, we propose a learnable HD estimation method that predicts HD directly from image embeddings, addressing computational cost concerns. However, simply introducing HD into a hybrid loss is insufficient to enhance diversity in FGMs due to: 1) degradation of image quality, and 2) limited improvement in generation diversity. To this end, during training, we adopt an HD-based loss with a monotonic momentum-driven scheduling strategy to progressively optimize the hyperparameters, obtaining optimal diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Moreover, during inference, we employ HD-guided rejection sampling to select geometrically richer outputs. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our FGM-HD framework yields a 39\\% improvement in output diversity compared to vanilla FGMs, while preserving comparable image quality. To our knowledge, this is the very first work introducing HD into FGM.

However, these static images, having almost lost their authentication attributes, cannot be reliably verified and are vulnerable to malicious copying and reuse. To address these issues, we propose AuthSig, a novel static electronic signature framework based on generative models and watermark, which binds authentication information to the signature image. Leveraging the human visual system's insensitivity to subtle style variations, AuthSig finely modulates style embeddings during generation to implicitly encode watermark bits-enforcing a One Signature, One Use policy.To overcome the scarcity of handwritten signature data and the limitations of traditional augmentation methods, we introduce a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy that effectively enhances style diversity to support robust watermark embedding.

Nevertheless, differences in data distribution (such as covariate and semantic shifts) severely affect its reliability in real-world deployments. To address this issue, we propose FedSDWC, a causal inference method that integrates both invariant and variant features. FedSDWC infers causal semantic representations by modeling the weak causal influence between invariant and variant features, effectively overcoming the limitations of existing invariant learning methods in accurately capturing invariant features and directly constructing causal representations. This approach significantly enhances FL's ability to generalize and detect OOD data. Theoretically, we derive FedSDWC's generalization error bound under specific conditions and, for the first time, establish its relationship with client prior distributions. Moreover, extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of FedSDWC in handling covariate and semantic shifts.

While diffusion-based anomaly detection has emerged as a promising approach for automated MA screening, its clinical application is hindered by three fundamental limitations. First, these models often fall prey to \"identity mapping\", where they inadvertently replicate the input image. Second, they struggle to distinguish MAs from other anomalies, leading to high false positives. Third, their suboptimal reconstruction of normal features hampers overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Wavelet Diffusion Transformer framework for MA Detection (WDT-MD), which features three key innovations: a noise-encoded image conditioning mechanism to avoid \"identity mapping\" by perturbing image conditions during training; pseudo-normal pattern synthesis via inpainting to introduce pixel-level supervision, enabling discrimination between MAs and other anomalies; and a wavelet diffusion Transformer architecture that combines the global modeling capability of diffusion Transformers with multi-scale wavelet analysis to enhance reconstruction of normal retinal features. Comprehensive experiments on the IDRiD and e-ophtha MA datasets demonstrate that WDT-MD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pixel-level and image-level MA detection.

Within the iterative-convolution thresholding method (ICTM) framework, we propose a variational segmentation model that integrates denoising terms. Specifically, the denoising component consists of an I-divergence term and an adaptive total-variation (TV) regularizer, making the model well suited to images contaminated by Gamma--distributed multiplicative noise and Poisson noise. A spatially adaptive weight derived from a gray-level indicator guides diffusion differently across regions of varying intensity. To further address intensity inhomogeneity, we estimate a smoothly varying bias field, which improves segmentation accuracy.

However, the representation spaces of modern PLMs are highly non--linear and geometrically structured, where textual embeddings reside on curved semantic manifolds rather than flat Euclidean spaces. Linear aggregation on such manifolds inevitably distorts geometry and causes semantic drift--a phenomenon where aggregated representations deviate from the intrinsic manifold, losing semantic fidelity and expressive power. To quantitatively investigate this problem, this work introduces a local PCA--based metric that measures the degree of semantic drift and provides the first quantitative framework to analyze how different aggregation mechanisms affect manifold structure. Building upon these insights, we propose Geodesic Aggregation, a manifold--aware mechanism that aggregates neighbor information along geodesics via log--exp mappings on the unit sphere, ensuring that representations remain faithful to the semantic manifold during message passing. We further develop GeoGNN, a practical instantiation that integrates spherical attention with manifold interpolation.

Main paper: 7 pages with 4 figures; Appendix: 8 pages with 7 figures", "summary": "Object detection methods have evolved from closed-set to open-set paradigms over the years. Current open-set object detectors, however, remain constrained by their exclusive reliance on positive indicators based on given prompts like text descriptions or visual exemplars. This positive-only paradigm experiences consistent vulnerability to visually similar but semantically different distractors. We propose T-Rex-Omni, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating negative visual prompts to negate hard negative distractors. Specifically, we first introduce a unified visual prompt encoder that jointly processes positive and negative visual prompts. Next, a training-free Negating Negative Computing (NNC) module is proposed to dynamically suppress negative responses during the probability computing stage. To further boost performance through fine-tuning, our Negating Negative Hinge (NNH) loss enforces discriminative margins between positive and negative embeddings. T-Rex-Omni supports flexible deployment in both positive-only and joint positive-negative inference modes, accommodating either user-specified or automatically generated negative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable zero-shot detection performance, significantly narrowing the performance gap between visual-prompted and text-prompted methods while showing particular strength in long-tailed scenarios (51.2 AP_r on LVIS-minival).

Dueling bandit (DB) algorithms enable optimal decision-making in IPE building on pairwise comparisons. However, they remain inefficient when human feedback is sparse. Existing methods address sparsity by heavily relying on parametric reward models, whose rigid assumptions are vulnerable to misspecification.

Existing language-decoder based mitigation approaches often regulate visual or textual attention independently, overlooking their interaction as two key causal factors. To address this, we propose Owl (Bi-mOdal attention reWeighting for Layer-wise hallucination mitigation), a causally-grounded framework that models hallucination process via a structural causal graph, treating decomposed visual and textual attentions as mediators. We introduce VTACR (Visual-to-Textual Attention Contribution Ratio), a novel metric that quantifies the modality contribution imbalance during decoding. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations frequently occur in low-VTACR scenarios, where textual priors dominate and visual grounding is weakened. To mitigate this, we design a fine-grained attention intervention mechanism that dynamically adjusts token- and layer-wise attention guided by VTACR signals. Finally, we propose a dual-path contrastive decoding strategy: one path emphasizes visually grounded predictions, while the other amplifies hallucinated ones -- letting visual truth shine and hallucination collapse. Experimental results on the POPE and CHAIR benchmarks show that Owl achieves significant hallucination reduction, setting a new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

Unlike the Euclidean distance of numerical attributes, the categorical attributes lack well-defined relationships of their possible values (also called categories interchangeably), which hampers the exploration of compact categorical data clusters. Although most attempts are made for developing appropriate distance metrics, they typically assume a fixed topological relationship between categories when learning distance metrics, which limits their adaptability to varying cluster structures and often leads to suboptimal clustering performance. This paper, therefore, breaks the intrinsic relationship tie of attribute categories and learns customized distance metrics suitable for flexibly and accurately revealing various cluster distributions. As a result, the fitting ability of the clustering algorithm is significantly enhanced, benefiting from the learnable category relationships. Moreover, the learned category relationships are proved to be Euclidean distance metric-compatible, enabling a seamless extension to mixed datasets that include both numerical and categorical attributes.

However, the VLM-generated labels exhibit dual limitations: low quality (i.e., label noise) and absence of error correction mechanisms. To enhance label quality, we propose Human-Corrected Labels (HCLs), a novel setting that efficient human correction for VLM-generated noisy labels. As shown in Figure 1(b), HCL strategically deploys human correction only for instances with VLM discrepancies, achieving both higher-quality annotations and reduced labor costs. Specifically, we theoretically derive a risk-consistent estimator that incorporates both human-corrected labels and VLM predictions to train classifiers. Besides, we further propose a conditional probability method to estimate the label distribution using a combination of VLM outputs and model predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior classification performance and is robust to label noise, validating the effectiveness of HCL in practical weak supervision scenarios.

While recent video generation models produce realistic visual sequences, they typically operate in the prompt-to-full-video manner without causal control, interactivity, or long-horizon consistency required for purposeful reasoning. Existing world modeling efforts, on the other hand, often focus on restricted domains (e.g., physical, game, or 3D-scene dynamics) with limited depth and controllability, and struggle to generalize across diverse environments and interaction formats. In this work, we introduce PAN, a general, interactable, and long-horizon world model that predicts future world states through high-quality video simulation conditioned on history and natural language actions. PAN employs the Generative Latent Prediction (GLP) architecture that combines an autoregressive latent dynamics backbone based on a large language model (LLM), which grounds simulation in extensive text-based knowledge and enables conditioning on language-specified actions, with a video diffusion decoder that reconstructs perceptually detailed and temporally coherent visual observations, to achieve a unification between latent space reasoning (imagination) and realizable world dynamics (reality). Trained on large-scale video-action pairs spanning diverse domains, PAN supports open-domain, action-conditioned simulation with coherent, long-term dynamics. Extensive experiments show that PAN achieves strong performance in action-conditioned world simulation, long-horizon forecasting, and simulative reasoning compared to other video generators and world models, taking a step towards general world models that enable predictive simulation of future world states for reasoning and acting.", "AI": {"tldr": "PAN\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u3001\u53ef\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u957f\u671f\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u62df\u6765\u9884\u6d4b\u672a\u6765\u4e16\u754c\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e86\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e16\u754c\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u7f3a\u4e4f\u56e0\u679c\u63a7\u5236\u3001\u4ea4\u4e92\u6027\u548c\u957f\u671f\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u73b0\u6709\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9886\u57df\u9650\u5236\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u751f\u6210\u6f5c\u5728\u9884\u6d4b(GLP)\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6f5c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u9aa8\u5e72\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u89e3\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u6837\u5316\u89c6\u9891-\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u52a8\u4f5c\u6761\u4ef6\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u62df\u3001\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u6a21\u62df\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u5668\u548c\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "PAN\u671d\u7740\u901a\u7528\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u8fc8\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u672a\u6765\u4e16\u754c\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u62df\u3002"}}

Prior methods--such as LocalNewton, LTDA, and FedSophia--have incorporated second-order optimization in FL by performing iterative local updates on clients and applying simple mixing of local parameters on the server. However, these methods often suffer from drift in local preconditioners, which significantly disrupts the convergence of parameter training, particularly in heterogeneous data settings. To overcome this issue, we refine the update rules by decomposing the ideal second-order update--computed using globally preconditioned global gradients--into parameter mixing on the server and local parameter updates on clients. As a result, our FedPM introduces preconditioned mixing of local parameters on the server, effectively mitigating drift in local preconditioners.\n  We provide a theoretical convergence analysis demonstrating a superlinear rate for strongly convex objectives in scenarios involving a single local update.

We investigate the minimum-cost poisoning attack required to steer an LLM's policy toward an attacker's target by flipping preference labels during RLHF/DPO, without altering the compared outputs. We formulate this as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints, deriving lower and upper bounds on the minimum attack cost. As a byproduct of this theoretical analysis, we show that any existing label-flipping attack can be post-processed via our proposed method to reduce the number of label flips required while preserving the intended poisoning effect. Empirical results demonstrate that this cost-minimization post-processing can significantly reduce poisoning costs over baselines, particularly when the reward model's feature dimension is small relative to the dataset size.

Recent work, Test-Time Counterattack (TTC), improves robustness by generating perturbations that maximize the embedding deviation of adversarial inputs using PGD, pushing them away from their adversarial representations. However, due to the fundamental difference in optimization objectives between adversarial attacks and counterattacks, generating counterattacks solely based on gradients with respect to the adversarial input confines the search to a narrow space. As a result, the counterattacks could overfit limited adversarial patterns and lack the diversity to fully neutralize a broad range of perturbations. In this work, we argue that enhancing the diversity and coverage of counterattacks is crucial to improving adversarial robustness in test-time defense. Accordingly, we propose Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC), which augments counterattack optimization by incorporating orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates. This design expands the exploration of the counterattack space and increases the diversity of perturbations, which facilitates the discovery of more generalizable counterattacks and ultimately improves the ability to neutralize adversarial perturbations.

Nonetheless, real-world data continually emerges, with possible compositions being nearly infinite, long-tailed, and not entirely visible. Thus, an ideal model is supposed to gradually improve the capability of compositional generalization in an incremental manner. In this paper, we explore Composition-Incremental Learning for Compositional Generalization (CompIL) in the context of the compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) task, where models need to continually learn new compositions, intending to improve their compositional generalization capability progressively. To quantitatively evaluate CompIL, we develop a benchmark construction pipeline leveraging existing datasets, yielding MIT-States-CompIL and C-GQA-CompIL.

While prior research has introduced various uncertainty bounds, most existing approaches require access to specific input features and rely on posterior mean and variance estimates or tuning hyperparameters. These limitations hinder robustness and fail to capture the model's global behavior in expectation. To address these limitations, we propose a chaining-based framework for estimating upper and lower bounds on the expected extreme values over unseen data, without requiring access to specific input locations. We provide kernel-specific refinements for commonly used kernels such as RBF and Mat\u00e9rn, in which our bounds are tighter than generic constructions. We further improve numerical tightness by avoiding analytical relaxations. In addition to global estimation, we also develop a novel method for local uncertainty quantification at specified inputs. This approach leverages chaining geometry through partition diameters, adapting to local structure without relying on posterior variance scaling.

With the rapid development of deep learning, researchers have begun applying Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to transcribe Kuzushiji into modern Japanese. Although existing OCR methods perform well on clean pre-modern Japanese documents written in Kuzushiji, they often fail to consider various types of noise, such as document degradation and seals, which significantly affect recognition accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset specifically addresses these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Degraded Kuzushiji Documents with Seals (DKDS) dataset as a new benchmark for related tasks. We describe the dataset construction process, which required the assistance of a trained Kuzushiji expert, and define two benchmark tracks: (1) text and seal detection and (2) document binarization. For the text and seal detection track, we provide baseline results using multiple versions of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) models for detecting Kuzushiji characters and seals. For the document binarization track, we present baseline results from traditional binarization algorithms, traditional algorithms combined with K-means clustering, and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based methods.

The process of downsampling rich, internal latent states into discrete tokens inherently limits the depth and nuance of information that can be transmitted, thereby hindering collaborative problem-solving. Inspired by human mind-reading, we propose Interlat (Inter-agent Latent Space Communication), a paradigm that leverages the last hidden states of an LLM as a representation of its mind for direct transmission (termed latent communication). An additional compression process further compresses latent communication via entirely latent space reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Interlat outperforms both fine-tuned chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and single-agent baselines, promoting more exploratory behavior and enabling genuine utilization of latent information. Further compression not only substantially accelerates inference but also maintains competitive performance through an efficient information-preserving mechanism.

To address these challenges, we propose PIFF, a physics-informed, flow-based generative neural network for near real-time flood depth estimation. Built on an image-to-image generative framework, it efficiently maps Digital Elevation Models (DEM) to flood depth predictions. The model is conditioned on a simplified inundation model (SPM) that embeds hydrodynamic priors into the training process. Additionally, a transformer-based rainfall encoder captures temporal dependencies in precipitation. Integrating physics-informed constraints with data-driven learning, PIFF captures the causal relationships between rainfall, topography, SPM, and flooding, replacing costly simulations with accurate, real-time flood maps. Using a 26 km study area in Tainan, Taiwan, with 182 rainfall scenarios ranging from 24 mm to 720 mm over 24 hours, our results demonstrate that PIFF offers an effective, data-driven alternative for flood prediction and response.", "AI": {"tldr": "PIFF\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u6d2a\u6c34\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u5c06\u6570\u5b57\u9ad8\u7a0b\u6a21\u578b\u6620\u5c04\u5230\u6d2a\u6c34\u6df1\u5ea6\u9884\u6d4b", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6d2a\u6c34\u6d4b\u7ed8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6548\u7387\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u8fd1\u5b9e\u65f6\u6d2a\u6c34\u6df1\u5ea6\u4f30\u7b97\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7b80\u5316\u6df9\u6ca1\u6a21\u578b(SPM)\u5d4c\u5165\u6c34\u52a8\u529b\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528transformer-based\u964d\u96e8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u6355\u6349\u964d\u6c34\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027", "result": "\u5728\u53f0\u535726\u516c\u91cc\u7814\u7a76\u533a\u57df\u7684182\u4e2a\u964d\u96e8\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u8bc1\u660ePIFF\u53ef\u63d0\u4f9b\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u5b9e\u65f6\u7684\u6d2a\u6c34\u9884\u6d4b", "conclusion": "PIFF\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u964d\u96e8\u3001\u5730\u5f62\u3001SPM\u4e0e\u6d2a\u6c34\u95f4\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u6d2a\u6c34\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u54cd\u5e94\u63d0\u4f9b\u6709\u6548\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848"}}

It helps reduce noise, improve generalization, and enhance interpretability. However, most existing unsupervised FS methods evaluate features in isolation, even though informative signals often emerge from groups of related features. For example, adjacent pixels, functionally connected brain regions, or correlated financial indicators tend to act together, making independent evaluation suboptimal. Although some methods attempt to capture group structure, they typically rely on predefined partitions or label supervision, limiting their applicability. We propose GroupFS, an end-to-end, fully differentiable framework that jointly discovers latent feature groups and selects the most informative groups among them, without relying on fixed a priori groups or label supervision.

Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation. In this paper, we present \\textbf{PressTrack-HMR}, a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes solely from pressure signals. This pipeline leverages a tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from the raw pressure data, and subsequently performs HMR for each extracted individual signal. Furthermore, we build a multi-person interaction pressure dataset \\textbf{MIP}, which facilitates further research into pressure-based human motion analysis in multi-person scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in multi-person HMR using pressure data, with 89.2~$mm$ MPJPE and 112.6~$mm$ WA-MPJPE$_{100}$, and these showcase the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition.

Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink. We show that DFDT improves return and stability over strong offline RL and sequence-model baselines across gravity, kinematic, and morphology shifts on D4RL-style control tasks, and further corroborate these gains with token-stitching and sequence-semantics stability analyses.", "AI": {"tldr": "DFDT\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6539\u8fdb\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u8de8\u57df\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u878d\u5408\u7a00\u7f3a\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u6e90\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u7528\u4f18\u52bf\u6761\u4ef6\u4ee4\u724c\u66ff\u6362RTG\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u5e76\u6dfb\u52a0Q\u5f15\u5bfc\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u72b6\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u8df3\u8dc3\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u57df\u7b56\u7565\u9002\u5e94\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e00\u7b80\u5355\u7b5b\u9009\u6807\u51c6\u9009\u62e9\u6e90\u8f68\u8ff9\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u62fc\u63a5\u65f6\u72b6\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u4e0d\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001RTG\u4e0d\u53ef\u6bd4\u3001\u52a8\u4f5c\u5728\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fde\u63a5\u5904\u8df3\u8dc3\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6700\u5927\u5747\u503c\u5dee\u5f02\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u8fdb\u884c\u72b6\u6001\u7ed3\u6784\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u504f\u5dee\u8fdb\u884c\u52a8\u4f5c\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u7b5b\u9009\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u7ea7\u6570\u636e\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u878d\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u6570\u636e\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u6e90\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u7528\u4f18\u52bf\u6761\u4ef6\u4ee4\u724c\u66ff\u4ee3RTG\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528Q\u5f15\u5bfc\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5668\u6291\u5236\u8fde\u63a5\u5904\u7684\u503c\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u8df3\u8dc3\u3002", "result": "\u5728D4RL\u98ce\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5f15\u529b\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u548c\u5f62\u6001\u53d8\u5316\u4e0a\uff0cDFDT\u76f8\u6bd4\u5f3a\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u56de\u62a5\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee4\u724c\u62fc\u63a5\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u8bed\u4e49\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "DFDT\u901a\u8fc7\u6062\u590d\u6570\u636e\u62fc\u63a5\u6027\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u51b3\u7b56\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u8f6c\u79fb\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e0eMMD\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548cOT\u504f\u5dee\u5ea6\u91cf\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u72b6\u6001\u503c\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u968f\u7740\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u5ea6\u91cf\u7f29\u5c0f\uff0c\u754c\u9650\u4f1a\u6536\u7d27\u3002"}}

Leveraging an octree-based transformer, our approach extracts hierarchical local descriptors at multiple granularities to increase robustness to clutter, self-similarity, and viewpoint changes in challenging scenarios, including ground-to-ground and ground-to-aerial in forest and urban environments. We propose a learnable multi-scale geometric verification module to reduce re-ranking failures in the presence of degraded single-scale correspondences. Our coarse-to-fine registration approach achieves comparable or lower localisation errors to baselines, with runtime improvements of two orders of magnitude over RANSAC for dense point clouds. Experimental results on public datasets show the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average Recall@1 of 90.7% on CS-Wild-Places: an improvement of 29.6 percentage points over baselines, while maintaining high performance on single-source benchmarks with an average Recall@1 of 91.7% and 96.0% on Wild-Places and MulRan, respectively. Our method achieves under 2 m and 5 degrees error for 97.2% of 6-DoF registration attempts, with our multi-scale re-ranking module reducing localisation errors by ~2$\\times$ on average.

FSampler maintains a short history of denoising signals (epsilon) from recent real model calls and extrapolates the next epsilon using finite difference predictors at second order, third order, or fourth order, falling back to lower order when history is insufficient. On selected steps the predicted epsilon substitutes the model call while keeping each sampler's update rule unchanged. Predicted epsilons are validated for finiteness and magnitude; a learning stabilizer rescales predictions on skipped steps to correct drift, and an optional gradient estimation stabilizer compensates local curvature. Protected windows, periodic anchors, and a cap on consecutive skips bound deviation over the trajectory. Operating at the sampler level, FSampler integrates with Euler/DDIM, DPM++ 2M/2S, LMS/AB2, and RES family exponential multistep methods and drops into standard workflows. FLUX.1 dev, Qwen Image, and Wan 2.2, FSampler reduces time by 8 to 22% and model calls by 15 to 25% at high fidelity (Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) 0.95 to 0.99), without altering sampler formulas.

However, reliable evaluation remains the primary bottleneck for responsible clinical deployment. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines DermBench, a meticulously curated benchmark, with DermEval, a robust automatic evaluator, to enable clinically meaningful, reproducible, and scalable assessment. We build DermBench, which pairs 4,000 real-world dermatology images with expert-certified diagnostic narratives and uses an LLM-based judge to score candidate narratives across clinically grounded dimensions, enabling consistent and comprehensive evaluation of multimodal models. For individual case assessment, we train DermEval, a reference-free multimodal evaluator. Given an image and a generated narrative, DermEval produces a structured critique along with an overall score and per-dimension ratings. This capability enables fine-grained, per-case analysis, which is critical for identifying model limitations and biases. Experiments on a diverse dataset of 4,500 cases demonstrate that DermBench and DermEval achieve close alignment with expert ratings, with mean deviations of 0.251 and 0.117 (out of 5), respectively, providing reliable measurement of diagnostic ability and trustworthiness across different multimodal LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408DermBench\u57fa\u51c6\u548cDermEval\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u5b66\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u53d9\u8ff0\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u5b66\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u65e5\u76ca\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u53ef\u9760\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ecd\u662f\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e0a\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3001\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1DermBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff08\u5305\u542b4000\u5f20\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u8ba4\u8bc1\u8bca\u65ad\u53d9\u8ff0\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8bad\u7ec3DermEval\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6279\u5224\u548c\u5404\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5019\u9009\u8bca\u65ad\u53d9\u8ff0\u3002", "result": "\u57284500\u4e2a\u75c5\u4f8b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0cDermBench\u548cDermEval\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u5206\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u504f\u5dee\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.251\u548c0.117\uff08\u6ee1\u52065\u5206\uff09\uff0c\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0d\u540c\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u5b66\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u6a21\u578b\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u548c\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

To prevent illicit use, it is desirable to be able to detect AI-generated text. Training and evaluation of such detectors critically depend on suitable benchmark datasets. Several groups took on the tedious work of collecting, curating, and publishing large and diverse datasets for this task. However, it remains an open challenge to ensure high quality in all relevant aspects of such a dataset. For example, the DetectRL benchmark exhibits relatively simple patterns of AI-generation in 98.5% of the Claude-LLM data. These patterns may include introductory words such as \"Sure! Here is the academic article abstract:\", or instances where the LLM rejects the prompted task. In this work, we demonstrate that detectors trained on such data use such patterns as shortcuts, which facilitates spoofing attacks on the trained detectors. We consequently reprocessed the DetectRL dataset with several cleansing operations. Experiments show that such data cleansing makes direct attacks more difficult.

To address this long-standing challenge, we propose a novel and fully parameter-free clustering framework via Self-supervised Consensus Maximization, named SCMax. Our framework performs hierarchical agglomerative clustering and cluster evaluation in a single, integrated process. At each step of agglomeration, it creates a new, structure-aware data representation through a self-supervised learning task guided by the current clustering structure. We then introduce a nearest neighbor consensus score, which measures the agreement between the nearest neighbor-based merge decisions suggested by the original representation and the self-supervised one. The moment at which consensus maximization occurs can serve as a criterion for determining the optimal number of clusters.

The few existing deep learning approaches rarely disentangle the role of neural architecture from that of signal choice. In this work, we systematically evaluate both aspects. We compare classical baselines with newer neural architectures across single signals, signal pairs, and grouped sensor inputs for diverse physical activities. Our results show that minute ventilation is the most predictive individual signal, with a transformer model achieving the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.87 W/kg across all activities. Paired and grouped signals, such as those from the Hexoskin smart shirt (five signals), offer good alternatives for faster models like CNN and ResNet with attention. Per-activity evaluation revealed mixed outcomes: notably better results in low-intensity activities (RMSE down to 0.29 W/kg; NRMSE = 0.04), while higher-intensity tasks showed larger RMSE but more comparable normalized errors. Finally, subject-level analysis highlights strong inter-individual variability, motivating the need for adaptive modeling strategies.

Here we extend the Feynman-Kac (FK) steering framework, an inference-time control approach, to diffusion-based protein design. By coupling FK steering with structure generation, the method guides sampling toward desirable structural or energetic features while maintaining the diversity of the underlying diffusion process. To enable simultaneous generation of both sequence and structure properties, rewards are computed on models refined through ProteinMPNN and all-atom relaxation. Applied to binder design, FK steering consistently improves predicted interface energetics across diverse targets with minimal computational overhead.

However, most existing approaches lack knowledge diversity, as they rely solely on unimodal visual information, overlooking the potential of cross-modal representations. In this work, we explore the use of CLIP's vision-language knowledge as a complementary source of supervision for KD, an area that remains largely underexplored. We propose a simple yet effective framework that fuses the logits and features of a conventional teacher with those from CLIP. By incorporating CLIP's multi-prompt textual guidance, the fused supervision captures both dataset-specific and semantically enriched visual cues. Beyond accuracy, analysis shows that the fused teacher yields more confident and reliable predictions, significantly increasing confident-correct cases while reducing confidently wrong ones. Moreover, fusion with CLIP refines the entire logit distribution, producing semantically meaningful probabilities for non-target classes, thereby improving inter-class consistency and distillation quality.

A key driver influencing B&B solvers efficiency is the variable selection heuristic that guides branching decisions. Looking to move beyond static, hand-crafted heuristics, recent work has explored adapting traditional reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to the B&B setting, aiming to learn branching strategies tailored to specific MILP distributions. In parallel, RL agents have achieved remarkable success in board games, a very specific type of combinatorial problems, by leveraging environment simulators to plan via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). Building on these developments, we introduce Plan-and-Branch-and-Bound (PlanB&B), a model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) agent that leverages a learned internal model of the B&B dynamics to discover improved branching strategies.

We present DensiCrafter, a framework for generating lightweight, self-supporting 3D hollow structures by optimizing the density field. Starting from coarse voxel grids produced by Trellis, we interpret these as continuous density fields to optimize and introduce three differentiable, physically constrained, and simulation-free loss terms. Additionally, a mass regularization penalizes unnecessary material, while a restricted optimization domain preserves the outer surface. Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes. In extensive evaluations, we achieve up to 43% reduction in material mass on the text-to-3D task.

When applied to medical image segmentation, the paradigm faces challenges due to inherent image ambiguities, making it particularly vulnerable to erroneous supervision. Crucially, the student's iterative reconfirmation of these errors leads to self-reinforcing bias. While some studies attempt to mitigate this bias, they often rely on external modifications to the conventional teacher-student framework, overlooking its intrinsic potential for error correction. In response, this work introduces a feedback mechanism into the teacher-student framework to counteract error reconfirmations. Here, the student provides feedback on the changes induced by the teacher's pseudo-labels, enabling the teacher to refine these labels accordingly. We specify that this interaction hinges on two key components: the feedback attributor, which designates pseudo-labels triggering the student's update, and the feedback receiver, which determines where to apply this feedback.

PETR and its variants (PETRs) excel in benchmarks but face deployment challenges due to high computational cost and memory footprint. Quantization is an effective technique for compressing deep neural networks by reducing the bit width of weights and activations. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to PETRs leads to severe accuracy degradation. This issue primarily arises from two key challenges: (1) significant magnitude disparity between multi-modal features-specifically, image features and camera-ray positional embeddings (PE), and (2) the inefficiency and approximation error of quantizing non-linear operators, which commonly rely on hardware-unfriendly computations. In this paper, we propose FQ-PETR, a fully quantized framework for PETRs, featuring three key innovations: (1) Quantization-Friendly LiDAR-ray Position Embedding (QFPE): Replacing multi-point sampling with LiDAR-prior-guided single-point sampling and anchor-based embedding eliminates problematic non-linearities (e.g., inverse-sigmoid) and aligns PE scale with image features, preserving accuracy. (2) Dual-Lookup Table (DULUT): This algorithm approximates complex non-linear functions using two cascaded linear LUTs, achieving high fidelity with minimal entries and no specialized hardware. (3) Quantization After Numerical Stabilization (QANS): Performing quantization after softmax numerical stabilization mitigates attention distortion from large inputs. On PETRs (e.g. PETR, StreamPETR, PETRv2, MV2d), FQ-PETR under W8A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (1% degradation) while reducing latency by up to 75%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ and QAT baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "FQ-PETR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9PETR\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u521b\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u6d6e\u70b9\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3PETR\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u6311\u6218\u5305\u62ec\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u5e45\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7b97\u5b50\u91cf\u5316\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff1a1\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u6fc0\u5149\u96f7\u8fbe\u5c04\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\uff08QFPE\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u53cc\u67e5\u627e\u8868\uff08DULUT\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff1b3\uff09\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u5316\u540e\u91cf\u5316\uff08QANS\uff09\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u51fd\u6570\u91cf\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728W8A8\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u6d6e\u70b9\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08\u4ec51%\u4e0b\u964d\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u9ad8\u8fbe75%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709PTQ\u548cQAT\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FQ-PETR\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86PETR\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe3D\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While extensive studies have examined attacks targeting either objective, strategies that simultaneously degrade both utility and fairness remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Dual-Facet Attack (DFA), a novel threat model that concurrently undermines predictive accuracy and group fairness. Two variants, Synchronous DFA (S-DFA) and Split DFA (Sp-DFA), are further proposed to capture distinct real-world collusion scenarios. Experimental results show that existing robust FL defenses, including hybrid aggregation schemes, fail to resist DFAs effectively. To counter these threats, we propose GuardFed, a self-adaptive defense framework that maintains a fairness-aware reference model using a small amount of clean server data augmented with synthetic samples. In each training round, GuardFed computes a dual-perspective trust score for every client by jointly evaluating its utility deviation and fairness degradation, thereby enabling selective aggregation of trustworthy updates.

Existing approaches generally follow an \"align-then-classify\" paradigm but face two fundamental issues, i.e., (i) fragile point-to-point alignment arising from imperfect semantics, and (ii) rigid classifiers restricted by static decision boundaries and coarse-grained anchors. To address these issues, we propose a novel method for zero-shot skeleton action recognition, termed $\\texttt{$\\textbf{Flora}$}$, which builds upon $\\textbf{F}$lexib$\\textbf{L}$e neighb$\\textbf{O}$r-aware semantic attunement and open-form dist$\\textbf{R}$ibution-aware flow cl$\\textbf{A}$ssifier. Specifically, we flexibly attune textual semantics by incorporating neighboring inter-class contextual cues to form direction-aware regional semantics, coupled with a cross-modal geometric consistency objective that ensures stable and robust point-to-region alignment. Furthermore, we employ noise-free flow matching to bridge the modality distribution gap between semantic and skeleton latent embeddings, while a condition-free contrastive regularization enhances discriminability, leading to a distribution-aware classifier with fine-grained decision boundaries achieved through token-level velocity predictions. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our method, showing particularly impressive performance even when trained with only 10\\% of the seen data.

However, efficiently capturing high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes remains a significant challenge. A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity. Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the 3DGS reconstruction process and achieves higher quality for targeted objects compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, while also serving as a robust uncertainty estimator for the global scene.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86OUGS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u539f\u8bed\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u7269\u7406\u9a71\u52a8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7279\u5b9a\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e3DGS\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u7387\u4e0d\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u56e0\u4e3a\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6307\u6807\u53d7\u80cc\u666f\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c6\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u4e0d\u4f18\u3002", "method": "\u4ece3D\u9ad8\u65af\u539f\u8bed\u7684\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\uff09\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e32\u67d3\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u4f20\u64ad\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u751f\u6210\u5bf9\u8c61\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e863DGS\u91cd\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u8c61\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "OUGS\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5206\u79bb\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u52a8\u89c6\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3002"}}

Existing vision-based methods often fail to generalize across domains and patients, leading to residual alignment errors. This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation. Overall, the proposed framework achieves robust, domain-invariant localization through iterative vision-based optimization, while the new benchmark provides a foundation for standardized progress in vision-based bronchoscopy navigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u652f\u6c14\u7ba1\u955c\u5bfc\u822a\u901a\u7528\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc72D-3D\u914d\u51c6\u5b9e\u73b0\u672f\u4e2d\u5bf9\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u89c6\u56fe\u4e0e\u524d\u64cd\u4f5cCT\u89e3\u5256\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e76\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u652f\u6c14\u7ba1\u955c\u672f\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u56f0\u96be\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u547c\u5438\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u89e3\u5256\u53d8\u5f02\u548cCT-\u8eab\u4f53\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u548c\u9519\u4f4d\u800c\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u4e0d\u540c\u57df\u548c\u60a3\u8005\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u8ba1\u7b97\u771f\u5b9e\u5185\u7aa5\u955cRGB\u5e27\u4e0eCT\u6e32\u67d3\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6e32\u67d3\u6a21\u5757\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u673a\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u914d\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u4ec5\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u5e73\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a2.65mm\uff0c\u65cb\u8f6c\u8bef\u5dee\u4e3a0.19rad\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5c55\u793a\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u89c6\u89c9\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u652f\u6c14\u7ba1\u955c\u5bfc\u822a\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8fdb\u5c55\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

We introduce MARBLE (Multi-Armed Restless Bandits in a Latent Markovian Environment), which augments RMABs with a latent Markov state that induces nonstationary behavior. In MARBLE, each arm evolves according to a latent environment state that switches over time, making policy learning substantially more challenging. We further introduce the Markov-Averaged Indexability (MAI) criterion as a relaxed indexability assumption and prove that, despite unobserved regime switches, under the MAI criterion, synchronous Q-learning with Whittle Indices (QWI) converges almost surely to the optimal Q-function and the corresponding Whittle indices.

Current MOT methods are often evaluated using publicly available datasets.

Despite the inherent challenges of tracking players in American football, such as frequent occlusion and physical contact, no standardized dataset has been publicly available, making fair comparisons between methods difficult. To address this gap, we constructed the first dedicated detection and tracking dataset for the American football players and conducted a comparative evaluation of various detection and tracking methods. Our results demonstrate that accurate detection and tracking can be achieved even in crowded scenarios. Fine-tuning detection models improved performance over pre-trained models. Furthermore, when these fine-tuned detectors and re-identification models were integrated into tracking systems, we observed notable improvements in tracking accuracy compared to existing approaches.

Lightweight CNNs are more efficient but suffer from accuracy gaps. Cross-Architecture Knowledge Distillation (CAKD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from ViTs to CNNs, yet existing methods often struggle with architectural mismatch and overlook the value of stronger homogeneous CNN teachers. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation framework that leverages both a heterogeneous ViT teacher and a homogeneous CNN teacher to collaboratively guide a lightweight CNN student. We introduce two key components: (1) Discrepancy-Aware Teacher Weighting, which dynamically fuses the predictions from ViT and CNN teachers by assigning adaptive weights based on teacher confidence and prediction discrepancy with the student, enabling more informative and effective supervision; and (2) a Structure Discrepancy-Aware Distillation strategy, where the student learns the residual features between ViT and CNN teachers via a lightweight auxiliary branch, focusing on transferable architectural differences without mimicking all of ViT's high-dimensional patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including HMDB51, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation approaches, achieving notable performance improvements with a maximum accuracy gain of 5.95% on HMDB51.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f02\u6784\u7684ViT\u548c\u540c\u6784\u7684CNN\u6559\u5e08\u6765\u534f\u540c\u6307\u5bfc\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7CNN\u5b66\u751f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u548c\u5ffd\u89c6\u5f3a\u5927CNN\u6559\u5e08\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "ViT\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u79c0\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7CNN\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u4e14\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u540c\u6784CNN\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "1) \u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u6559\u5e08\u52a0\u6743\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6559\u5e08\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u4e0e\u5b66\u751f\u9884\u6d4b\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6743\u91cd\u878d\u5408ViT\u548cCNN\u6559\u5e08\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b2) \u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u84b8\u998f\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8f85\u52a9\u5206\u652f\u5b66\u4e60ViT\u4e0eCNN\u6559\u5e08\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5728HMDB51\u3001EPIC-KITCHENS-100\u548cKinetics-400\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cHMDB51\u4e0a\u6700\u5927\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u8fbe5.95%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7CNN\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5f02\u6784\u548c\u540c\u6784\u6559\u5e08\u534f\u540c\u6307\u5bfc\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Feature attribution methods have become a popular solution for providing post-hoc explanations, yet the field has historically lacked a formal problem definition. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a formal definition for the problem of feature attribution, which stipulates that explanations be supported by an underlying probability distribution represented by the given dataset. Our analysis reveals that many existing model-agnostic methods fail to meet this criterion, while even those that do often possess other limitations. To overcome these challenges, we propose Distributional Feature Attribution eXplanations (DFAX), a novel, model-agnostic method for feature attribution. DFAX is the first feature attribution method to explain classifier predictions directly based on the data distribution.

However, most existing methods rely solely on geometric cues and predict each 3D pose independently, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous motions and generalize to real-world scenarios. Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation. DreamPose3D dynamically conditions the denoising process using task-relevant action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, capturing high-level intent. To model the structural relationships between joints effectively, we introduce a representation encoder that incorporates kinematic joint affinity into the attention mechanism. Finally, a hallucinative pose decoder predicts temporally coherent 3D pose sequences during training, simulating how humans mentally reconstruct motion trajectories to resolve ambiguity in perception. Extensive experiments on benchmarked Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all metrics. To further validate DreamPose3D's robustness, we tested it on a broadcast baseball dataset, where it demonstrated strong performance despite ambiguous and noisy 2D inputs, effectively handling temporal consistency and intent-driven motion variations.", "AI": {"tldr": "DreamPose3D\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u76843D\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u60f3\u8c61\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\u548c\u9ad8\u5c42\u610f\u56fe\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u72ec\u7acb\u9884\u6d4b\u6bcf\u5e27\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u7cca\u8fd0\u52a8\u5e76\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u3002\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u7406\u89e3\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u5c42\u610f\u56fe\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDreamPose3D\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1)\u4ece2D\u59ff\u6001\u5e8f\u5217\u63d0\u53d6\u4efb\u52a1\u76f8\u5173\u52a8\u4f5c\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b2)\u8868\u793a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u878d\u5165\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5173\u8282\u4eb2\u548c\u6027\uff1b3)\u5e7b\u89c9\u59ff\u6001\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u76f8\u5e72\u76843D\u59ff\u6001\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5728Human3.6M\u548cMPI-3DHP\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5728\u5e7f\u64ad\u68d2\u7403\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u7cca\u5608\u6742\u76842D\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5e76\u9002\u5e94\u610f\u56fe\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "DreamPose3D\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u57283D\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u7cca\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

It is widely used in finance, advertising, medicine, and other domains. Two main approaches to SHAP calculation exist: Path-Dependent SHAP, which leverages the tree structure for efficiency, and Background SHAP, which uses a background dataset to estimate feature distributions.\n  We introduce WOODELF, a SHAP algorithm that integrates decision trees, game theory, and Boolean logic into a unified framework. For each consumer, WOODELF constructs a pseudo-Boolean formula that captures their feature values, the structure of the decision tree ensemble, and the entire background dataset. It then leverages this representation to compute Background SHAP in linear time. WOODELF can also compute Path-Dependent SHAP, Shapley interaction values, Banzhaf values, and Banzhaf interaction values.\n  WOODELF is designed to run efficiently on CPU and GPU hardware alike. Available via the WOODELF Python package, it is implemented using NumPy, SciPy, and CuPy without relying on custom C++ or CUDA code. This design enables fast performance and seamless integration into existing frameworks, supporting large-scale computation of SHAP and other game-theoretic values in practice.\n  For example, on a dataset with 3,000,000 rows, 5,000,000 background samples, and 127 features, WOODELF computed all Background Shapley values in 162 seconds on CPU and 16 seconds on GPU - compared to 44 minutes required by the best method on any hardware platform, representing 16x and 165x speedups, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "WOODELF\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684SHAP\u8ba1\u7b97\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u3001\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u548c\u5e03\u5c14\u903b\u8f91\u6574\u5408\u5230\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728CPU\u548cGPU\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684SHAP\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301CPU\u548cGPU\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u5e94\u5bf9\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5927\u89c4\u6a21SHAP\u503c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "WOODELF\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7528\u6237\u6784\u5efa\u4f2a\u5e03\u5c14\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u6355\u83b7\u5176\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u96c6\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6574\u4e2a\u80cc\u666f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5229\u7528\u8be5\u8868\u793a\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u8ba1\u7b97Background SHAP\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e5f\u80fd\u8ba1\u7b97\u5176\u4ed6\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b300\u4e07\u884c\u3001500\u4e07\u80cc\u666f\u6837\u672c\u548c127\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cWOODELF\u5728CPU\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u6240\u6709Background Shapley\u503c\u53ea\u9700162\u79d2\uff0816\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff09\uff0c\u5728GPU\u4e0a\u4ec5\u970016\u79d2\uff08165\u500d\u52a0\u901f\uff09\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "WOODELF\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684SHAP\u8ba1\u7b97\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u4e14\u652f\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u786c\u4ef6\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

While existing attacks primarily rely on data poisoning, they require large-scale user access or fake profiles thus lacking practicality. In this paper, we focus on the Profile Pollution Attack that subtly contaminates partial user interactions to induce targeted mispredictions. Previous PPA methods suffer from two limitations, i.e., i) over-reliance on sequence horizon impact restricts fine-grained perturbations on item transitions, and ii) holistic modifications cause detectable distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a constrained reinforcement driven attack CREAT that synergizes a bi-level optimization framework with multi-reward reinforcement learning to balance adversarial efficacy and stealthiness. We first develop a Pattern Balanced Rewarding Policy, which integrates pattern inversion rewards to invert critical patterns and distribution consistency rewards to minimize detectable shifts via unbalanced co-optimal transport. Then we employ a Constrained Group Relative Reinforcement Learning paradigm, enabling step-wise perturbations through dynamic barrier constraints and group-shared experience replay, achieving targeted pollution with minimal detectability.

This work introduces Abstract Gradient Training (AGT), a unified framework for certifying robustness of a given model and training procedure to training data perturbations, including bounded perturbations, the removal of data points, and the addition of new samples.

Recently, stringent privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA have introduced significant new challenges for existing spatio-temporal graph models, requiring complete unlearning of unauthorized data. Since each node in a spatio-temporal graph diffuses information globally across both spatial and temporal dimensions, existing unlearning methods primarily designed for static graphs and localized data removal cannot efficiently erase a single node without incurring costs nearly equivalent to full model retraining. Therefore, an effective approach for complete spatio-temporal graph unlearning is a pressing need. To address this, we propose CallosumNet, a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal graph unlearning framework inspired by the corpus callosum structure that facilitates communication between the brain's two hemispheres. CallosumNet incorporates two novel techniques: (1) Enhanced Subgraph Construction (ESC), which adaptively constructs multiple localized subgraphs based on several factors, including biologically-inspired virtual ganglions; and (2) Global Ganglion Bridging (GGB), which reconstructs global spatio-temporal dependencies from these localized subgraphs, effectively restoring the full graph representation. Empirical results on four diverse real-world datasets show that CallosumNet achieves complete unlearning with only 1%-2% relative MAE loss compared to the gold model, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies verify the effectiveness of both proposed techniques.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u65f6\u7a7a\u56fe\u4e2d\u7531\u4e8e\u8282\u70b9\u4fe1\u606f\u8de8\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6269\u6563\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CallosumNet\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u7c7b\u4f3c\u80fc\u80dd\u4f53\u7684\u5206\u6cbb\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u589e\u5f3a\u5b50\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u5168\u5c40\u795e\u7ecf\u8282\u6865\u63a5\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5728\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u8282\u70b9\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "motivation": "\u7531\u4e8eGDPR\u7b49\u9690\u79c1\u6cd5\u89c4\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u65f6\u7a7a\u56fe\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u5b8c\u5168\u5220\u9664\u672a\u7ecf\u6388\u6743\u7684\u6570\u636e\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u9759\u6001\u56fe\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u7a7a\u56fe\u4e2d\u8282\u70b9\u4fe1\u606f\u5728\u65f6\u7a7a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u6269\u6563\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9057\u5fd8\u6210\u672c\u63a5\u8fd1\u5b8c\u5168\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002", "method": "1.\u589e\u5f3a\u5b50\u56fe\u6784\u5efa-\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u4e2a\u672c\u5730\u5316\u5b50\u56fe\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u53d7\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u865a\u62df\u795e\u7ecf\u8282\uff1b2.\u5168\u5c40\u795e\u7ecf\u8282\u6865\u63a5-\u4ece\u672c\u5730\u5316\u5b50\u56fe\u91cd\u5efa\u5168\u5c40\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6062\u590d\u5b8c\u6574\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCallosumNet\u4ec5\u4ea7\u751f1%-2%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9MAE\u635f\u5931\u5373\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b8c\u6574\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f18\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "CallosumNet\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6cbb\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5b50\u56fe\u6784\u5efa\u4e0e\u6865\u63a5\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u65f6\u7a7a\u56fe\u8282\u70b9\u7684\u5b8c\u5168\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u89c4\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

However, existing methods typically rely on retain data to constrain model behavior, which increases computational and energy burdens and conflicts with industrial data silos and privacy compliance requirements. To address this, we propose a novel retain-free unlearning framework, referred to as Probing then Editing (PTE). PTE frames unlearning as a probe-edit process: first, it probes the decision boundary neighborhood of the model on the to-be-forgotten class via gradient ascent and generates corresponding editing instructions using the model's own predictions. Subsequently, a push-pull collaborative optimization is performed: the push branch actively dismantles the decision region of the target class using the editing instructions, while the pull branch applies masked knowledge distillation to anchor the model's knowledge on retained classes to their original states. Benefiting from this mechanism, PTE achieves efficient and balanced knowledge editing using only the to-be-forgotten data and the original model. Experimental results demonstrate that PTE achieves an excellent balance between unlearning effectiveness and model utility across multiple general and industrial benchmarks such as CWRU and SCUT-FD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9057\u5fd8\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6PTE\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u9488-\u7f16\u8f91\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5de5\u4e1a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5e73\u8861\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u52a8\u6001\u5de5\u4e1a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u8fc7\u65f6\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u89c4\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "method": "PTE\u6846\u67b6\u91c7\u7528\u63a2\u9488-\u7f16\u8f91\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u63a2\u9488\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7f16\u8f91\u6307\u4ee4\uff1b\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8-\u62c9\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u62c6\u5378\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\u51b3\u7b56\u533a\u57df\u5e76\u951a\u5b9a\u4fdd\u7559\u7c7b\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793aPTE\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5982CWRU\u548cSCUT-FD\uff09\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5f85\u9057\u5fd8\u6570\u636e\u548c\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5de5\u4e1a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u65b0\u9700\u6c42\u3002"}}

We find that a single transformer model trained on millions of programs is able to generalize across symbolic regression problems of varying dimension. Evaluated on 24 real-world and synthetic datasets, TSGP significantly outperforms standard GP, SLIM_GSGP, Deep Symbolic Regression, and Denoising Autoencoder GP, achieving an average rank of 1.58 across all benchmarks. Moreover, TSGP produces more compact solutions than SLIM_GSGP, despite its higher accuracy. In addition, the target semantic distance $\\mathrm{SD}_t$ is able to control the step size in the semantic space: small values of $\\mathrm{SD}_t$ enable consistent improvement in fitness but often lead to larger programs, while larger values promote faster convergence and compactness.

An Extensive Approach Considering Statistical, Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models", "comment": "6,227 words text + 2*250 (2 tables) = 6,727 words", "summary": "With rapid urbanization in recent decades, traffic congestion has intensified due to increased movement of people and goods. As planning shifts from demand-based to supply-oriented strategies, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. A core ITS function is traffic forecasting, enabling proactive measures like ramp metering, signal control, and dynamic routing through platforms such as Google Maps. This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20.

However, most existing data-driven methods used for SEP predictions are operated as black-box models, making it challenging for solar physicists to interpret the results and understand the underlying physical causes of such events rather than just obtain a prediction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates global explanations and ad-hoc feature mapping to enhance model transparency and provide deeper insights into the decision-making process. We validate our approach using a dataset of 341 SEP events, including 244 significant (>=10 MeV) proton events exceeding the Space Weather Prediction Center S1 threshold, spanning solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. Furthermore, we present an explainability-focused case study of major SEP events, demonstrating how our method improves explainability and facilitates a more physics-informed understanding of SEP event prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u63d0\u9ad8\u592a\u9633\u9ad8\u80fd\u7c92\u5b50\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u592a\u9633\u9ad8\u80fd\u7c92\u5b50\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u9884\u6d4b\u7ed3\u679c\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u7269\u7406\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u592a\u9633\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u5bf9\u4e8b\u4ef6\u672c\u8d28\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u91ca\u673a\u5236\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u900f\u660e\u5316\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e341\u4e2aSEP\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5305\u542b244\u4e2a\u663e\u8457\u8d28\u5b50\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff09\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u5b9e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u4e3b\u8981SEP\u4e8b\u4ef6\u4e2d\u63d0\u4f9b\u7269\u7406\u7406\u89e3\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5bf9\u592a\u9633\u9ad8\u80fd\u7c92\u5b50\u4e8b\u4ef6\u66f4\u7269\u7406\u5316\u7684\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u63a8\u8fdb\u7a7a\u95f4\u5929\u6c14\u9884\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u3002"}}

However, existing methods suffer from Gradient Starvation and Policy Degradation when training directly on samples with mixed difficulty. To mitigate this, prior approaches leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data, but the construction of high-quality CoT annotations remains labor-intensive. Alternatively, curriculum learning strategies have been explored but frequently encounter challenges, such as difficulty mismatch, reliance on manual curriculum design, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose AdaCuRL, a Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation with adaptive curriculum scheduling. This approach dynamically aligns data difficulty with model capability and incorporates a data revisitation mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, AdaCuRL employs adaptive reference and sparse KL strategies to prevent Policy Degradation.

Rather than training policies or value heads, we investigate whether planning can be carried out directly in an evaluation-aligned embedding space. We introduce SOLIS, which learns such a space using supervised contrastive learning. In this representation, outcome similarity is captured by proximity, and a single global advantage vector orients the space from losing to winning regions. Candidate actions are then ranked according to their alignment with this direction, reducing planning to vector operations in latent space.

Current Rehearsal-based CL methods typically construct the memory buffer by selecting a representative subset (referred to as coresets), aiming to approximate the training efficacy of the full dataset with minimal storage overhead. However, mainstream Coreset Selection (CS) methods generally formulate the CS problem as a bi-level optimization problem that relies on numerous inner and outer iterations to solve, leading to substantial computational cost thus limiting their practical efficiency. In this paper, we aim to provide a more efficient selection logic and scheme for coreset construction. To this end, we first analyze the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the buffer-trained model and the Bayes-optimal model through the perspective of localized error decomposition to investigate the contribution of samples from different regions to MSE suppression. Further theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that samples with high probability density play a dominant role in error suppression. Inspired by this, we propose the Probability Density-Aware Coreset (PDAC) method. PDAC leverages the Projected Gaussian Mixture (PGM) model to estimate each sample's joint density, enabling efficient density-prioritized buffer selection. Finally, we introduce the streaming Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to enhance the adaptability of PGM parameters to streaming data, yielding Streaming PDAC (SPDAC) for streaming scenarios.

Synthetic data generation offers scalability, but its effectiveness relies on complex, multi-stage workflows, integrating prompt engineering and model orchestration. Existing automated workflow methods face a cold start problem: they require labeled datasets for reward modeling, which is especially problematic for subjective, open-ended tasks with no objective ground truth. We introduce AutoSynth, a framework that automates workflow discovery and optimization without reference datasets by reframing the problem as a Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a novel dataset-free hybrid reward. This reward enables meta-learning through two LLM-as-judge components: one evaluates sample quality using dynamically generated task-specific metrics, and another assesses workflow code and prompt quality. Experiments on subjective educational tasks show that while expert-designed workflows achieve higher human preference rates (96-99% win rates vs. AutoSynth's 40-51%), models trained on AutoSynth-generated data dramatically outperform baselines (40-51% vs. 2-5%) and match or surpass expert workflows on certain metrics, suggesting discovery of quality dimensions beyond human intuition. These results are achieved while reducing human effort from 5-7 hours to just 30 minutes (>90% reduction). AutoSynth tackles the cold start issue in data-centric AI, offering a scalable, cost-effective method for subjective LLM tasks.

The task is complicated by the large modality gap between sequences and phenotypes, as well as the pleiotropic nature of gene-phenotype relationships. Existing sequence-based efforts focus on the degree to which variants of specific genes alter a limited set of phenotypes, while general gene knockout induced phenotype abnormality prediction methods heavily rely on curated genetic information as inputs, which limits scalability and generalizability. As a result, the task of broadly predicting the presence of multiple phenotype abnormalities under gene knockout directly from gene sequences remains underexplored. We introduce GenePheno, the first interpretable multi-label prediction framework that predicts knockout induced phenotypic abnormalities from gene sequences. GenePheno employs a contrastive multi-label learning objective that captures inter-phenotype correlations, complemented by an exclusive regularization that enforces biological consistency. It further incorporates a gene function bottleneck layer, offering human interpretable concepts that reflect functional mechanisms behind phenotype formation. To support progress in this area, we curate four datasets with canonical gene sequences as input and multi-label phenotypic abnormalities induced by gene knockouts as targets.
